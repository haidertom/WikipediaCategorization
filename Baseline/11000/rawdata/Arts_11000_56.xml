'''Alternative formats''' include [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]], [[braille]], [[E-text|electronic]] or [[large print]] versions of standard print such as educational material, textbooks, information leaflets, and even people's personal bills and letters. Alternative formats are created to help people who are blind or visual impaired to gain assess to their personal and leisure information either by sight (large print), by ear (audio) or by touch (braille).

== Audio ==
Audio information is beneficial for many people and can be used by anyone who owns a CD player, a [[DAISY Digital Talking Book|DAISY player]] or a computer. Audio enables people who are blind or visual impaired to access information through hearing, in the sense that print readers would understand it. 

=== Choosing audio ===
Different people are likely to have their own preferences about the way they access audio, depending on their experiences, how comfortable are they with technology, and the equipment they to access the audio content.

=== CD as a medium for accessing information ===
[[File:Interference-colors.jpg|thumb|Interference-colors]]
[[Compact Discs]] (CDs) were first produced  in the 1980s to store and playback sound recordings exclusively, and became superior to [[cassette tapes]] (AC) offering better sound and size. Standard CDs have a diameter of 120 millimetres (4.7 in) and can hold up to 80 minutes of uncompressed audio (or 700 Megabytes of data). CDs offer some navigation from the beginning of one track to another, rather than having to fast forward or rewind and guess where the tracks started and finished.[[File:Cassette-tape 8192.jpg|thumb|Cassette-tape 8192]]

Over time, CDs have progressed from being solely for music, to being a format for all kinds of data storage, such as text, images, photos and videos. Educators can use CDs to store educational materials including taped lectures, presentations, and handouts into one compact disc for the student to access on CD players or computers.

== Braille ==
Braille is a tactile system of raised dots that enables people who are visual impaired or blind to access information by touch. The pattern of raised dots is arranged in cells of up to six dots, creating a total of 63 different combinations possible. Each cell represents an alphabet letter, numeral or punctuation mark. Some frequently used words and letter combinations also have their own single cell patterns.

[[File:A person reading a braille book.jpg|thumb|A person reading a braille book]]
Braille can be the building block for language skills and a way to teach spelling, grammar, and punctuations to people with vision loss or who are deaf-blind. Not only do Braille codes represent alphabets, they also denote numbers, symbols, music and mathematical notations, enabling people to learn about different subjects in a different way from most of us. Braille books are available in all subject areas, ranging from modern fiction to mathematics, music and law. As with printed text, Braille makes it possible for people to access information in this format.

== Electronic (e-text) ==
For many of us, having access to computer equipment and appropriate software makes written information accessible. Today’s technology allows people to do majority of their research online, share documents via email, and download lecture notes from school websites. With written text converted into a format that is readable on the computer, it can be accessed visually with screen magnification software, or through auditory means with text-to-speech technology.

== Large print ==
Large print is essential for people who have visual or learning difficulties and have trouble reading fine print or deciphering crowded text at one time. Large print usually ranges from 16 to 22 point, while giant print uses fonts that are bigger than 24 point.

Having one single size will not meet everyone’s needs; therefore, it is important to find out which is a comfortable reading size for each individual. Research has demonstrated the positive impacts of providing enlarged font size for people with mild to moderate visual impairments, resulting in an increased reading fluency and speed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15741">[[File:VandA Rotunda.jpg|thumb|[[Dale Chihuly]]'s [[V&amp;A Rotunda Chandelier|30-foot blown-glass chandelier]] in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in 2000]]
'''American craft''' is craft work produced by independent studio artists, working with traditional [[craft]] materials and/or processes such as [[wood]], [[woodworking]] or [[furniture|furniture making]], [[glass]] or [[glassblowing]],  [[clay]] or [[ceramic]]s, [[textiles]], [[metal]] or [[metalworking]]. Studio craft works tend to either serve or allude to a functional or utilitarian purpose, though they are as often as not handled and exhibited in ways similar to visual art objects.

==History==
The American studio craft movement is a successor to earlier European craft movements.  Modern studio crafts developed as a reaction to [[modernity]] and, particularly, the [[Industrial Revolution]].  During the nineteenth century, Scottish historian [[Thomas Carlyle]] and English social critic [[John Ruskin]] warned of the extinction of [[handicrafts]] in [[Europe]].  English designer and theorist [[William Morris]] continued this line of thought, becoming father of [[England's]] [[Arts &amp; Crafts Movement]].  Morris distinguished the studio craftsman in this way:  "[O]ur art is the work of a small minority composed of educated persons, fully conscious of their aim of producing beauty, and distinguished from the great body of workmen by that aim."  Both European and American craft traditions have also been influenced by [[Art Nouveau]].  Both of these movements influenced the development of the contemporary studio craft movement in the [[United States]] during the late nineteenth century, throughout the twentieth century and to the present.

==American craft pioneers==
[[File:Tiffany Window of St Augustine - Lightner Museum.jpg|left|border|thumb|[[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], Window of [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], in the [[Lightner Museum]], [[St. Augustine, Florida]]]]
In the early nineteenth century it became popular for rural Americans of modest means to take the decoration of their homes and furniture into their own hands.  The artist [[Rufus Porter (inventor)|Rufus Porter]] was an early proponent of the American craft movement. In 1825 he published  ''A Select Collection of Valuable and Curious Arts, and Interesting Experiments Which are Well Explained, and Warranted Genuine, and May be Prepared, Safely and at Little Expense'', which is a book of instructions for domestic decorative arts, including wall, floor, and furniture painting.

By the end of the nineteenth century, the preindustrial craft trades had almost disappeared.  Industrial expansion and westward movement had largely severed American culture from early Colonial American and Native American craft roots.  Against this backdrop, [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] was a pioneer of the American craft movement, arguing for the placement of well-designed and crafted objects in the American home.  Tiffany's elegant [[stained glass]] creations were influenced by the values of [[William Morris]] and became America's leading embodiment of [[art nouveau]].

{{main|Gustav Stickley}}
[[Gustav Stickley]], the [[cabinetmaker]] was an early leader in the development of [[Studio Furniture]] and the American craft movement.  Stickley's designs were distinguished by their simplicity and by their harmony between interior [[decorative art]] and [[architecture]].  Stickley's magazine, "[[The Craftsman (magazine)|The Craftsman]]," was a forum for this movement from 1901 through 1916.  Originally focused on expounding ideas from the [[England]]'s [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], "The Craftsman" increasingly developed American craft concepts over the years of its publication. Stickley's ideas later had influence on [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and future generations of American craftsmen, artists and architects.

The [[Roycroft]] movement was an American adaptation of the British arts and crafts movement founded by [[Elbert Hubbard]] and his wife [[Bertha Crawford Hubbard]] in the small-town of [[East Aurora, New York]] in 1895.  Its focus was on writing and publishing ornate books, but it also made furniture and metal products. Roycroft was organized as a living/working artisans' community along the lines of a [[Medieval]] European [[guild]].

==Early craft institutions==
The studio crafts movement was fostered by the establishment of crafts programs within post-secondary educational institutions.  In 1894, for example, North America's first [[university]] [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] department was begun at [[Ohio State University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]].  This was followed in 1901 by the establishment of the first ceramics art school at [[Alfred University]] in [[Alfred (village), New York|Alfred, New York]].  Similarly, the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] established the first metal arts class in 1901 and the first textiles class in 1903.

After World War I, a postwar spirit of internationalism influenced the establishment of other important craft institutions, such as the [[Cranbrook Academy of Art]] in [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]].  Cranbrook craftsmen translated organic and geometric forms into the style that would be known as [[Art Deco]].  At Cranbrook, teachers like [[Maija Grotell]] produced important work in their own right while also teaching a new generation of young studio craft artists.

==The Depression years and World War II==
During the [[Great Depression|Depression]] years, the federal Works Progress Administration funded crafts projects as well as public works and murals as a way to both keep workers working and as a way to increase national morale.  This enabled crafts to flourish at a local level.  At the same time, American art programs began to include craft studies into their curricula.

[[World War II]] brought an influx of European artists and craftsmen. These European exiles brought with them a range of historical traditions including not only European craft practices but also knowledge of Asian and other non-Western cultures. One example of this influx is Tage Frid, a Danish furniture maker, who established the reputation of the Furniture Making program at Rhode Island School of Design, and there are certainly others. Also during the post World War II period a general dissatisfaction with industrial society began to fuel further support for handmade art objects.  In 1943, the [[American Craft Council]] was founded to support craftspeople and cultivate an appreciation for their work.  The ACC's founder, [[Aileen Osborn Webb]] was a potter interested in creating marketing opportunities for studio craftsmen.  The organization eventually grew to include [[American Craft (magazine)|''American Craft'']] magazine and the [[Museum of Arts and Design]] (then called the Museum of Contemporary Crafts and at one point known as the American Craft Museum).  As a result of these phenomena, post-war American craft became stylistically more refined as well as technically more proficient.

==The 1950s and Peter Voulkos==
{{main|Peter Voulkos}}
[[File:Voulkos-Balistreri.jpg|thumb|left|[[Peter Voulkos]] (left) assisted by [[John Balistreri]].]]During the 1950s, some artists turned to the '''[[truth-to-materials]]''' doctrine.  This movement also entailed an emphasis on the collective production of crafts work.  Craftsmen sometimes worked together during this period to develop more ambitious projects.   Throughout the 1950s and afterwards, [[Pottery|potter]] [[Peter Voulkos]] developed increasingly largescale and nontraditional [[ceramic]] works, influenced by [[Abstract Expressionism]], which transformed traditional understandings of the [[craft]] media.  Like the [[Abstract Expressionists]], Voulkos emphasized performance, process and primal expression in his ceramic forms.  In some cases, Voulkos deconstructed and reconstructed traditional ceramic [[Bowl (vessel)|vessel]] forms such as plates, ice buckets, and [[tea bowls]].  In other works, Voulkos created new nonutilitarian forms, such as his purely sculptural, large-scale cylindrical "stacks."

Voulkos was also influenced by [[Zen Buddhism]] after a 1952 encounter with Japanese potter [[Shoji Hamada]].  Hamada encouraged Voulkos to embrace a Zen approach to ceramics based not only upon technical proficiency but also upon a mental and spiritual union between creator and art object.  Voulkos later cited Hamada's statement that it "took him ten years to learn the potter's wheel and another ten years to forget it"—an insight that inspired Voulkos' early attempts to fully form a teapot in two minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Anglin Burgard, The Art of Craft: Contemporary Works from the Saxe Collection, [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]], 1999 at 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Voulkos taught at [[Black Mountain College]] in 1953, where he was further exposed to the [[avant-garde]] movements.   In 1954, he founded the [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] department at the [[Otis College of Art and Design]] (then called the Los Angeles County Art Institute).  In [[California]], Voulkos' [[pottery]] rapidly became abstract and sculptural.  Voulkos then moved to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he founded another [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] department and taught from 1959 until 1985.  At Berkeley, Voulkos became increasingly prominent for his massive, cracked and slashed pots.

==The 1960s and the new glassblowing movement==
The culture of the 1960s was even more conducive to the development of studio crafts.  This period saw a rejection of [[materialism]] and exploration of alternative ways of living.  For some, the creation of [[handicrafts]] provided just such an outlet.  In 1962, then-[[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] professor [[Harvey Littleton]] and chemist [[Dominick Labino]] began the contemporary  [[glassblowing]] movement.  The impetus for the movement consisted of their two workshops at the [[Toledo Museum of Art]], during which they began experimenting with melting glass in a small furnace and creating blown glass art. Thus Littleton and Labino were the first to make molten glass feasible for artists in private studios. [[Harvey Littleton]] extended his influence through his own important artistic contributions and through his teaching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmog.org/dynamic.aspx?id=1792 The Corning Museum of Glass. "Decades in Glass: The '60s."]&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the years, [[Harvey Littleton]] trained many of the most important contemporary glass artists, including [[Marvin Lipofsky]], Sam Herman (Britain), Fritz Dreisbach and [[Dale Chihuly]].  These Littleton students in turn developed the new movement and spread it across the country.  [[Marvin Lipofsky]], for example, is credited with being one of the founders of the [[Glass Art Society]] and introducing studio glass to California.   In 1967, Lipofsky founded the glass program at the [[California College of Arts and Crafts]], which he headed for two decades.

In 1971, [[Dale Chihuly]] began the influential [[Pilchuck Glass School]] near the rural town of [[Stanwood, Washington]]. Influenced by the [[Haystack Mountain School of Crafts]] (the first school to have a glass furnace), and the [[Penland School of Crafts]],  [[Pilchuck Glass School]] has become a center of the contemporary American [[studio glass movement]], of which Chihuly is a leading figure. Artist [[Toots Zynsky]], a Pilchuck pioneer, observed that the choice of a Western location for the school reflected a conscious rejection of the Eastern art establishment. The naming of the school also reflected the founders' countercultural attraction to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] culture.  Chihuly chose the name "Pilchuck," derived from the [[Chinookan]] words for "red" and "water," alluding to the iron-rich waters of the nearby [[Pilchuck River]].

==The Renwick Gallery==
{{main|Renwick Gallery}}
[[File:RenwickGallery.jpg|left|thumb|border]]
In 1972, the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Renwick Gallery]] was founded as a studio craft department of the [[National Museum of American Art]].  Housed in the original [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] building across [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]] from the [[White House]], it provided a distinguished setting for American studio craft objects in [[Washington, D.C.]]

==The Year of American Craft==
In 1992, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] signed a proclamation designating 1993 as '''The Year of American Craft'''.  As part of this commemoration, [[Renwick Gallery]] director Michael Monroe selected seventy-two works by seventy American craftsmen which were donated to the [[White House]] to serve as [[The White House Collection of American Crafts]].  This collection was displayed for four months at the [[National Museum of American Art]] in 1995.

|author=Atwell, Mary Stuart|date=December 5, 2012|accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporating [[List of feminist literature|feminist themes]], the novel follows a group of young women who become convinced to punish their fathers by a charismatic teacher.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

==Plot==
A group of high school-aged girls in a small town in rural Michigan come under the influence of a charismatic new teacher named Irene Stark. Mrs. Stark preaches on issues regarding [[women's liberation]], and convinces each of the girls to take revenge on their fathers for having oppressed their mothers in their lives.

==Controversy==
Due to its thematic concerns with rape, abortion, domestic violence, feminism and [[antifeminism]], the novel was [[Book censorship in the United States|banned]] from libraries in several states upon its 1997 republication, namely from Jackson County School libraries in West Virginia in 1997, as well as school libraries in Virginia, Indiana, and New Mexico from 2000 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bannedlibrary.com/podcast/2016/5/20/banned-57-daughters-of-eve-by-lois-duncan|work=Banned Library|title=Daughters of Eve|accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dura-Europos church''' (also known as the '''Dura-Europos house church''') is the earliest identified [[Christian]] [[house church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Snyder |first=Graydon F. |title=Ante Pacem: Archaeological Evidence of Church Life Before Constantine |publisher=Mercer University Press |year=2003 |pp=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in [[Dura-Europos]] in [[Syria]]. It is one of the earliest known Christian churches,&lt;ref&gt;''The people are holy: the history and theology of Free Church worship'' by Graydon F. Snyder, Doreen M. McFarlane 2005 {{ISBN|0-86554-952-4}} page 30&lt;/ref&gt; and was apparently a normal domestic house converted for worship some time between 233 and 256, when the town was abandoned after conquest by the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Significance of the Early House Churches|author=Floyd V. Filson|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|volume=58|number=2| date=June 1939 |pages=105–112|jstor=3259855|doi=10.2307/3259855}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is less famous, smaller, and more modestly decorated than the nearby [[Dura Europos synagogue]], though there are many other similarities between them.

Although the fate of the church structure is unknown after occupation by [[ISIS]], its famous frescos were removed after discovery and are now preserved at [[Yale University Art Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.artgallery.yale.edu/duraeuropos/dura.html Yale University]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The site of Dura-Europos, a former city and walled fortification, was excavated largely in the 1920s and 1930s by French and American teams. Within the archaeological site, the house church is located by the 17th tower and preserved by the same defensive fill that saved the nearby [[Dura-Europos synagogue]].

The building consists of a house conjoined to a separate hall-like room, which functioned as the meeting room for the church. The surviving [[frescoes]] of the room serving as the [[baptistry]] are probably the most ancient Christian [[painting]]s. The "[[Good Shepherd]]", the "Healing of the paralytic" and "Christ and Peter walking on the water" are considered the earliest depictions of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Graydon F. Snyder, Ante pacem: archaeological evidence of church life before Constantine, pp. 129-134, (Mercer University Press, 2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=swtI9Cpyl3kC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

A much larger fresco depicts three women (the third mostly lost) approaching a large sarcophagus. This most likely depicts [[the three Marys]] visiting Christ's tomb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.artgallery.yale.edu/duraeuropos/dura.html Yale: "Unearthing the Christian building", p.4]&lt;/ref&gt; There were also frescoes of [[Adam and Eve]] as well as [[David and Goliath]]. The frescoes clearly followed the [[Hellenistic Jewish]] [[iconographic]] tradition, but they are more crudely done than the paintings of the nearby [[Dura-Europos synagogue]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=swtI9Cpyl3kC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_sGraydon F. Snyder, ''Ante pacem: archaeological evidence of church life before Constantine''], pp. 129-134, Mercer University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Fragments of [[parchment]] scrolls with [[Hebrew]] texts have also been unearthed; they resisted meaningful translation until [[J.L. Teicher]] pointed out that they were Christian [[Eucharist]]ic prayers, so closely connected with the prayers in ''[[Didache]]'' that he was able to fill lacunae in the light of the ''Didache'' text.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Teicher, "Ancient Eucharistic Prayers in Hebrew (Dura-Europos Parchment D. Pg. 25)", ''The Jewish Quarterly Review'' New Series '''54'''.2 (October 1963), pp. 99-109&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, among fragments of text recovered from the town dump outside the [[Palmyrene Gate]], a fragmentary text from an unknown [[Dura Parchment 24|Greek gospel harmony]] account was unearthed.  It was comparable to [[Tatian]]'s ''[[Diatessaron]]'', but independent of it.

'''Engraving''' is the practice of incising a design onto a hard, usually flat surface by cutting grooves into it with a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]]. The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when silver, gold, steel, or [[Glass engraving|glass]] are engraved, or may provide an [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing plate, of copper or another metal, for printing images on paper as prints or illustrations; these images are also called "engravings". Engraving is one of the oldest and most important techniques in [[printmaking]]. [[Wood engraving]] is a form of [[relief printing]] and is not covered in this article.

Engraving was a historically important method of producing images on paper in artistic [[printmaking]], in [[mapmaking]], and also for commercial reproductions and illustrations for books and magazines. It has long been replaced by various [[photographic]] processes in its commercial applications and, partly because of the difficulty of learning the technique, is much less common in printmaking, where it has been largely replaced by [[etching]] and other techniques.

"Engraving" is also loosely but incorrectly used for any old black and white print; it requires a degree of expertise to distinguish engravings from prints using other techniques such as [[etching]] in particular, but also [[mezzotint]] and other techniques. Many [[old master print]]s also combine techniques on the same plate, further confusing matters.  [[Line engraving]] and [[steel engraving]] cover use for reproductive prints, illustrations in books and magazines, and similar uses, mostly in the 19th century, and often not actually using engraving.

Traditional engraving, by [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] or with the use of machines, continues to be practised by [[goldsmith]]s, glass engravers, [[Gunsmith#Gun Engraver|gunsmiths]] and others, while modern industrial techniques such as [[photoengraving]] and [[laser engraving]] have many important applications. [[Engraved gem]]s were an important art in the ancient world, revived at the Renaissance, although the term traditionally covers [[relief]] as well as intaglio carvings, and is essentially a branch of sculpture rather than engraving, as drills were the usual tools.

==Terms==
[[Image:gravers.jpg|thumb|left|An assortment of hand engraving tools]]

Other terms often used for printed engravings are '''copper engraving''', '''copper-plate engraving''' or ''[[line engraving]]''. [[Steel engraving]] is the same technique, on steel or steel-faced plates, and was mostly used for banknotes, illustrations for books, magazines and reproductive prints, [[letterhead]]s and similar uses from about 1790 to the early 20th century, when the technique became less popular, except for banknotes and other forms of [[security printing]]. Especially in the past, "engraving" was often used very loosely to cover several printmaking techniques, so that many so-called engravings were in fact produced by totally different techniques, such as etching or [[mezzotint]]. "Hand engraving" is a term sometimes used for engraving objects other than printing plates, to inscribe or decorate jewellery, firearms, trophies, knives and other fine metal goods. Traditional engravings in printmaking are also "hand engraved", using just the same techniques to make the lines in the plate.

Each graver is different and has its own use. '''Engravers''' use a hardened steel tool called a burin, or graver, to cut the design into the surface, most traditionally a copper plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/bosse/grand/214.htm|title=Abraham Bosse|year=1645|publisher=Bibliothèque nationale de France|accessdate=15 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern hand engraving artists use burins or gravers to cut a variety of metals such as silver, nickel, steel, brass, gold, titanium, and more, in applications from weaponry to jewellery to motorcycles to found objects. Modern professional engravers can engrave with a resolution of up to 40 lines per mm in high grade work creating game scenes and scrollwork. [[Die (manufacturing)|Dies]] used in mass production of molded parts are sometimes hand engraved to add special touches or certain information such as part numbers.

In addition to hand engraving, there are engraving machines that require less human finesse and are not directly controlled by hand. They are usually used for lettering, using a [[pantograph]]ic system. There are versions for the insides of rings and also the outsides of larger pieces. Such machines are commonly used for inscriptions on rings, lockets and presentation pieces.

===Tools and gravers or burins===
Gravers come in a variety of shapes and sizes that yield different line types. The burin produces a unique and recognizable quality of line that is characterized by its steady, deliberate appearance and clean edges. The angle tint tool has a slightly curved tip that is commonly used in printmaking. Florentine liners are flat-bottomed tools with multiple lines incised into them, used to do fill work on larger areas or to create uniform shade lines that are fast to execute. Ring gravers are made with particular shapes that are used by jewelry engravers in order to cut inscriptions inside rings. Flat gravers are used for fill work on letters, as well as "wriggle" cuts on most musical instrument engraving work, remove background, or create bright cuts. Knife gravers are for line engraving and very deep cuts. Round gravers, and flat gravers with a radius, are commonly used on silver to create bright cuts (also called '''bright-cut engraving'''), as well as other hard-to-cut metals such as nickel and steel. Square or V-point gravers are typically square or elongated diamond-shaped and used for cutting straight lines. V-point can be anywhere from 60 to 130 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]], depending on purpose and effect. These gravers have very small cutting points. Other tools such as [[mezzotint]] rockers, roulets and burnishers are used for texturing effects. Burnishing tools can also be used for certain stone setting techniques.

Musical instrument engraving on American-made brass instruments flourished in the 1920s and utilizes a specialized engraving technique where a flat graver is "walked" across the surface of the instrument to make zig-zag lines and patterns. The method for "walking" the graver may also be referred to as "wriggle" or "wiggle" cuts. This technique is necessary due to the thinness of metal used to make musical instruments versus firearms or jewelry. Wriggle cuts are commonly found on silver Western jewelry and other Western metal work.

===Tool geometry===
[[File:2008-engraving.jpg|right|thumb|Stone engraving]]
Tool geometry is extremely important for accuracy in hand engraving. When sharpened for most applications, a graver has a "face", which is the top of the graver, and a "heel", which is the bottom of the graver; not all tools or application require a heel. These two surfaces meet to form a point that cuts the metal. The geometry and length of the heel helps to guide the graver smoothly as it cuts the surface of the metal. When the tool's point breaks or chips, even on a microscopic level, the graver can become hard to control and produces unexpected results. Modern innovations have brought about new types of carbide that resist chipping and breakage, which hold a very sharp point longer between resharpening than traditional metal tools.

===Tool sharpening===
Sharpening a graver or burin requires either a [[sharpening stone]] or wheel. Harder carbide and steel gravers require diamond-grade sharpening wheels; these gravers can be polished to a mirror finish using a ceramic or cast iron lap, which is essential in creating bright cuts. Several low-speed, reversible sharpening system made specifically for hand engravers are available that reduce sharpening time. Fixtures that secure the tool in place at certain angles and geometries are also available to take the guesswork from sharpening to produce accurate points. Very few master engravers exist today who rely solely on "feel" and muscle memory to sharpen tools. These master engravers typically worked for many years as an apprentice, most often learning techniques decades before modern machinery was available for hand engravers. These engravers typically trained in such countries as Italy and Belgium, where hand engraving has a rich and long heritage of masters.

===Artwork design===
Design or artwork is generally prepared in advance, although some professional and highly experienced hand engravers are able to draw out minimal outlines either on paper or directly on the metal surface just prior to engraving. The work to be engraved may be lightly scribed on the surface with a sharp point, laser marked, drawn with a fine permanent marker (removable with acetone) or pencil, transferred using various chemicals in conjunction with inkjet or laser printouts, or [[Stipple engraving|stippled]]. Engraving artists may rely on hand drawing skills, copyright-free designs and images, computer-generated artwork, or common design elements when creating artwork.

===Handpieces===
Originally, handpieces varied little in design as the common use was to push with the handle placed firmly in the center of the palm. With modern pneumatic engraving systems, handpieces are designed and created in a variety of shapes and power ranges. Handpieces are made using various methods and materials. Knobs may be handmade from wood, molded and engineered from plastic, or machine-made from brass, steel, or other metals. The most widely known hand engraving tool maker, GRS Tools in Kansas is an American-owned and operated company that manufacture handpieces as well as many other tools for various applications in metal engraving.

===Cutting the surface===
[[Image:Louis George Meistergraveurin 2.jpg|thumb|left|Master engraver ennobling a watch movement. Top level engravers work under a [[stereo microscope]]. ]]

The actual engraving is traditionally done by a combination of pressure and manipulating the work-piece. The traditional "hand push" process is still practiced today, but modern technology has brought various mechanically assisted engraving systems. Most pneumatic engraving systems require an air source that drives air through a hose into a handpiece, which resembles a traditional engraving handle in many cases, that powers a mechanism (usually a piston). The air is actuated by either a foot control (like a gas pedal or sewing machine) or newer palm / hand control. This mechanism replaces either the "hand push" effort or the effects of a hammer. The internal mechanisms move at speeds up to 15,000 strokes per minute, thereby greatly reducing the effort needed in traditional hand engraving. These types of pneumatic systems are used for power assistance only and do not guide or control the engraving artist. One of the major benefits of using a pneumatic system for hand engraving is the reduction of fatigue and decrease in time spent working.

Hand engraving artists today employ a combination of hand push, pneumatic, rotary, or hammer and chisel methods. Hand push is still commonly used by modern hand engraving artists who create "bulino" style work, which is highly detailed and delicate, fine work; a great majority, if not all, traditional printmakers today rely solely upon hand push methods. Pneumatic systems greatly reduce the effort required for removing large amounts of metal, such as in deep relief engraving or Western bright cut techniques.

===Finishing===
Finishing the work is often necessary when working in metal that may rust or where a colored finish is desirable, such as a firearm. A variety of spray lacquers and finishing techniques exist to seal and protect the work from exposure to the elements and time. Finishing also may include lightly sanding the surface to remove small chips of metal called "burrs" that are very sharp and unsightly. Some engravers prefer high contrast to the work or design, using black paints or inks to darken removed (and lower) areas of exposed metal. The excess paint or ink is wiped away and allowed to dry before lacquering or sealing, which may or may not be desired by the artist.

===Modern hand engraving===
[[File:Hand engraving tool.jpg|thumb|Hand Engraving Tool Example]]

Because of the high level of microscopic detail that can be achieved by a master engraver, [[counterfeit]]ing of engraved designs is well-nigh impossible, and modern [[banknote]]s are almost always engraved, as are plates for printing money, checks, bonds and other security-sensitive papers. The engraving is so fine that a normal printer cannot recreate the detail of hand engraved images, nor can it be scanned. In the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], more than one hand engraver will work on the same plate, making it nearly impossible for one person to duplicate all the engraving on a particular banknote or document.

The modern discipline of hand engraving, as it is called in a [[metalworking]] context, survives largely in a few specialized fields. The highest levels of the art are found on firearms and other metal weaponry, jewellery, and musical instruments.

In most commercial markets today, hand engraving has been replaced with milling using CNC engraving or [[milling machine]]s. Still, there are certain applications where use of hand engraving tools cannot be replaced.

===Machine engraving===
[[File:1847Colt Walker.jpg|thumb|1847 Colt Walker pistol with roll engraved cylinder]]
In some instances, images or designs can be transferred to metal surfaces via mechanical process. One such process is roll stamping or roller-die engraving. In this process, a hardened image die is pressed against the destination surface using extreme pressure to impart the image. In the 1800s [[pistol cylinder]]s were often decorated via this process to impart a continuous scene around its surface.

===Computer-aided machine engraving===
[[Image:Engraving on Corian.jpg|thumb|left|Computerized engraving on [[Corian]].]]
Engraving machines such as the K500 (packaging) or K6 (publication) by Hell Gravure Systems use a diamond stylus to cut cells. Each cell creates one printing dot later in the process. A K6 can have up to 18 engraving heads each cutting 8.000 cells per second to an accuracy of .1&amp;nbsp;µm and below. They are fully computer-controlled and the whole process of cylinder-making is fully automated.

It is now common place for retail stores (mostly jewellery, silverware or award stores) to have a small computer controlled engrave on site. This enables them to personalise the products they sell. Retail engraving machines tend to be focused around ease of use for the operator and the ability to do a wide variety of items including flat metal plates, jewelry of different shapes and sizes, as well as cylindrical items such as mugs and tankards. They will typically be equipped with a computer dedicated to graphic design that will enable the operator to easily design a text or picture graphic which the software will translate into digital signals telling the engraver machine what to do. Unlike industrial engravers, retail machines are smaller and only use one diamond head. This is interchangeable so the operator can use differently shaped diamonds for different finishing effects. They will typically be able to do a variety of metals and plastics. Glass and crystal engraving is possible, but the brittle nature of the material makes the process more time consuming.

Retail engravers mainly use two different processes. The first and most common 'Diamond Drag' pushes the diamond cutter through the surface of the material and then pulls to create scratches. These direction and depth are controlled by the computer input. The second is 'Spindle Cutter'. This is similar to Diamond Drag, but the engraving head is shaped in a flat V shape, with a small diamond and the base. The machine uses an electronic spindle to quickly rotate the head as it pushes it into the material, then pulls it along whilst it continues to spin. This creates a much bolder impression than diamond drag. It is used mainly for brass plaques and pet tags.

With state-of-the-art machinery it is easy to have a simple, single item complete in under ten minutes.
The engraving process with diamonds is state-of-the-art since the 1960s.

Today laser engraving machines are in development but still mechanical cutting has proven its strength in economical terms and quality. More than 4,000 engravers make approx. 8 Mio printing cylinders worldwide per year.

==History==
''For the printing process, see [[intaglio (printmaking)]]. For the Western art history of engraved prints, see [[old master print]] and [[line engraving]]''

The first evidence for humans engraving patterns is a chiselled shell, dating back between 540,000 and 430,000 years, from Trinil, in Java, Indonesia, where the first Homo erectus was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2014/12/worlds-oldest-engraving-discovered/ World's oldest engraving discovered], Australian Geographic, 4 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Hatched banding upon ostrich eggshells used as water containers found in South Africa in the [[Diepkloof Rock Shelter]] and dated to the [[Middle Stone Age]] around 60,000 BC are the next documented case of human engraving.&lt;ref name="Texier"&gt;Texier PJ, Porraz G, Parkington J, Rigaud JP, Poggenpoel C, Miller C, Tribolo C, Cartwright C, Coudenneau A, Klein R, Steele T, Verna C. (2010). "A Howiesons Poort tradition of engraving ostrich eggshell containers dated to 60,000 years ago at Diepkloof Rock Shelter, South Africa". ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA''. {{doi|10.1073/pnas.0913047107}} {{PMID|20194764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engraving on bone and ivory is an important technique for the [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]], and larger engraved [[petroglyph]]s on rocks are found from many prehistoric periods and cultures around the world.

In [[Ancient history|antiquity]], the only engraving on metal that could be carried out is the shallow grooves found in some jewellery after the beginning of the 1st Millennium B.C. The majority of so-called engraved designs on ancient gold rings or other items were produced by [[chasing (metalworking)|chasing]] or sometimes a combination of [[lost-wax casting]] and chasing. [[Engraved gem]] is a term for any carved or engraved semi-precious stone; this was an important small-scale art form in the ancient world, and remained popular until the 19th century.
[[File:Battle of Engravers by George Cruikshank 1828.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Battle of Engravers'', [[satire|satirical]] [[etching]] by [[George Cruikshank]], showing hypothetical battle between the engravers, including [[William Hogarth]], [[Antoine Masson]], [[William Woollett]], [[Jean-Joseph Balechou]], [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Marcantonio Raimondi]].]]
However the use of [[glass engraving]], usually using a wheel, to cut decorative scenes or figures into glass vessels, in imitation of [[hardstone carving]]s, appears as early as the first century AD,&lt;ref name="Caron"&gt;Caron, B., A Roman Figure-Engraved Glass Bowl. Metropolitan Museum Journal, 1993. 28: p. 47–55.&lt;/ref&gt; continuing into the fourth century CE at urban centers such as Cologne and Rome,&lt;ref name="Fleming"&gt;Fleming, S.J., Roman Glass; reflections on cultural change. 1999, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.&lt;/ref&gt; and appears to have ceased sometime in the fifth century. Decoration was first based on Greek mythology, before hunting and circus scenes became popular, as well as imagery drawn from the Old and New Testament.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; It appears to have been used to mimic the appearance of precious metal wares during the same period, including the application of gold leaf, and could be cut free-hand or with lathes. As many as twenty separate stylistic workshops have been identified, and it seems likely that the engraver and vessel producer were separate craftsmen.&lt;ref name="Caron" /&gt;

In the European Middle Ages goldsmiths used engraving to decorate and inscribe metalwork. It is thought that they began to print impressions of their designs to record them. From this grew the engraving of copper printing plates to produce artistic images on paper, known as [[old master print]]s, in Germany in the 1430s. Italy soon followed. Many early engravers came from a goldsmithing background. The first and greatest period of the engraving was from about 1470 to 1530, with such masters as [[Martin Schongauer]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], and [[Lucas van Leiden]].

[[File:Rembrandt - self portrait etching.jpg|thumb|right|Modern impression of Rembrandt's 1639 self-portrait, with the engraving plate.]]
Thereafter engraving tended to lose ground to [[etching]], which was a much easier technique for the artist to learn. But many prints combined the two techniques: although [[Rembrandt]]'s prints are generally all called etchings for convenience, many of them have some burin or drypoint work, and some have nothing else. By the nineteenth century, most engraving was for commercial illustration.

Before the advent of photography, engraving was used to reproduce other forms of art, for example paintings. Engravings continued to be common in newspapers and many books into the early 20th century, as they were cheaper to use in printing than photographic images.

Many classic postage stamps were engraved, although the practice is now mostly confined to particular countries, or used when a more "elegant" design is desired and a limited color range is acceptable.

[[File:Buffalo nickles.jpg|thumb|right|[[Buffalo nickel]]s, coins customised with engraving tools]] 
Modifying the [[relief]] designs on coins is a craft dating back to the 18th century and today modified coins are known colloquially as [[hobo nickel]]s. In the United States, especially during the [[Great Depression]], coin engraving on the large-faced [[Buffalo nickel|Indian Head nickel]] became a way to help make ends meet. The craft continues today, and with modern equipment often produces stunning miniuture sculptural artworks and floral scrollwork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2016/10/shaun-hughes-engraving/ Elaborate Floral Scrollwork Engraved on Coins] by Shaun Hughes embellishing existing coin faces with different styles of floral scrollwork (2016).  Retrieved May 27 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-20th century, a renaissance in hand-engraving began to take place. With the inventions of pneumatic hand-engraving systems that aided hand-engravers, the art and techniques of hand-engraving became more accessible. 

===Music engraving===
{{main|Music engraving}}
The first music printed from engraved plates dates from 1446 and most printed music was produced through engraving from roughly 1700–1860. From 1860–1990 most printed music was produced through a combination of engraved master plates reproduced through offset lithography.

The first comprehensive account is given by Mme Delusse in her article "Gravure en lettres, en géographie et en musique" in [[Diderot]]'s Encyclopedia. The technique involved a five-pointed raster to score staff lines, various punches in the shapes of notes and standard musical symbols, and various burins and scorers for lines and slurs. For correction, the plate was held on a bench by callipers, hit with a dot punch on the opposite side, and burnished to remove any signs of the defective work. The process involved intensive pre-planning of the layout, and many manuscript scores with engraver's planning marks survive from the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poole|first=H. Edmund|title=Music Printing and Publishing|year=1980|publisher=Norton|location=New York|pages=40–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1837 [[pewter]] had replaced copper as a medium, and Berthiaud gives an account with an entire chapter devoted to music (''Novel manuel complet de l'imprimeur en taille douce'', 1837). Printing from such plates required a separate inking to be carried out cold, and the printing press used less pressure. Generally, four pages of music were engraved on a single plate. Because music engraving houses trained engravers through years of apprenticeship, very little is known about the practice. Fewer than one dozen sets of tools survive in libraries and museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gamble|first=William|title=Music Engraving and Printing: Historical and Technical Treatise|year=1923|publisher=Pitman|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900 music engravers were established in several hundred cities in the world, but the art of storing plates was usually concentrated with publishers. Extensive bombing of Leipzig in 1944, the home of most German engraving and printing firms, destroyed roughly half the world's engraved music plates.

==Applications today==
[[File:Ars moriendi (Meister E.S.), L.181.png|thumb|[[Ars moriendi]] engraving by Master ES, circa 1450]]

Examples of contemporary uses for engraving include creating text on jewellery, such as pendants or on the inside of [[engagement ring|engagement]]- and [[wedding ring]]s to include text such as the name of the partner, or adding a winner's name to a sports trophy.  Another application of modern engraving is found in the [[printing]] industry. There, every day thousands of pages are mechanically engraved onto [[rotogravure]] cylinders, typically a steel base with a copper layer of about 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm in which the image is transferred. After engraving the image is protected with an approximately 6&amp;nbsp;µm chrome layer. Using this process the image will survive for over a million copies in high speed [[printing press]]es.  Engraving machines such as GUN BOW (one of the leading engraving brands) are the best examples of hand engraving tools, although this type of machine is typically not used for fine hand engraving.
Some schools throughout the world are renowned for their teaching of engraving, like the [[École Estienne]] in Paris.

==Creating tone==
[[Image:Claude Mellan - Face of Christ - WGA14764.jpg|thumb|''Sudarium of Saint Veronica'' by [[Claude Mellan]] (1649), a famous showpiece where the image is formed by a single continuous line, starting on the tip of Christ's nose.]]

In traditional engraving, which is a purely linear medium, the impression of [[half-tone]]s was created by making many very thin parallel lines, a technique called [[hatching]]. When two sets of parallel-line ''hatchings'' intersected each other for higher density, the resulting pattern was known as ''cross-hatching''. Patterns of dots were also used in a technique called [[stippling]], first used around 1505 by [[Giulio Campagnola]]. [[Claude Mellan]] was one of many 17th-century engravers with a very well-developed technique of using parallel lines of varying thickness (known as the "swelling line") to give subtle effects of tone (as was [[Hendrick Goltzius|Goltzius]]) – see picture below. One famous example is his ''[[Veil of Veronica|Sudarium of Saint Veronica]]'' (1649), an engraving of the face of Jesus made from a single spiraling line that starts at the tip of Jesus's nose.

==Biblical references==
The earliest allusion to engraving in the Bible may be the reference to [[Judah (Biblical figure)|Judah]]'s seal ring (Ge 38:18), followed by (Ex 39.30). Engraving was commonly done with pointed tools of iron or even with diamond points. (Jer 17:1).

Each of the two onyx stones on the shoulder-pieces of the high priest’s [[ephod]] was engraved with the names of six different tribes of [[Israel]], and each of the 12 precious stones that adorned his breastpiece was engraved with the name of one of the tribes. The holy sign of dedication, the shining gold plate on the high priest's turban, was engraved with the words: "Holiness belongs to [[Adonai]]." [[Bezalel]], along with Oholiab, was qualified to do this specialized engraving work as well as to train others.—Ex 35:30–35; 28:9–12; 39:6–14, 30.

'''Friederike Caroline Neuber''', née '''Friederike Caroline Weissenborn''', also known as  '''Friedericke Karoline Neuber''', '''Frederika Neuber''', '''Karoline Neuber''', '''Carolina Neuber''', '''Frau Neuber''', and '''''Die Neuberin''''',  (9 March 1697 in [[Reichenbach im Vogtland]] – 30 November 1760 near [[Dresden]]), was a [[Germans|German]] actress and theatre director. She is considered one of the most famous actresses and actor-managers in the history of the German theatre, "influential in the development of modern German theatre." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Caroline-Neuber|title=Caroline Neuber: German actress and manager|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neuber also worked to improve the social and artistic status of German actors and actresses, emphasizing [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic technique]].&lt;ref name="Sharpe, Lesley 1995" /&gt; During a time when theatrical managers in Germany were predominantly men, Caroline Neuber stands out in history as a remarkably ambitious woman who, during her 25-year career, was able to alter theatrical history, elevating the status of German theatre alongside of Germany's most important male theatrical leaders at the time, such as "her actor-manager husband Johann, the popular stage fool Johann Müller, the major actor of the next generation Johann Schönemann, the multi-talented newcomer Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, and principally, their de facto Dramaturg, Johann Gottsched."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Life and work==
[[File:Neuberin playbill.png|thumb|Playbill of the theatrical company of Friederike Caroline Neuber from 8 September 1738 in Hamburg.]]

=== Early life ===
Friederike Caroline Weissenborn was born 9 March 1697 in [[Reichenbach im Vogtland]] to Daniel Weissenborn and his wife Anna Rosine Weissenborn, née Anna Rosine Wihelmine.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Peter Kümmel: ''With Anger and Courage.'' In: ''DIE ZEIT,'' No. 48 (English translation from German) ([http://www.zeit.de/2010/48/Theater-Neuberin/komplettansicht online], accessed 11 April 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a legal court inspector and her mother was very well-educated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; From her mother, Caroline learned reading, writing, and French. Her tyrannical father beat her mother until her mother's early death in 1705. Caroline spent the rest of her childhood with her father in [[Zwickau]] where she lived from 1702–1717.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Allegedly, Caroline was unloved and neglected by her father who may have also beaten her; she had a scar on her face attributed to her father's beatings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Reportedly, she attempted to escape her home as early as age 15. However, it was not until age 20, in 1717, that Caroline successfully ran away from home with [[:de:Johann Neuber|Johann Neuber]], a clerk who had worked for her father.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The couple married one year later in 1718. Together the Neubers "served their theatrical apprenticeship in the traveling companies of Christian Spiegelberg (1717–22) and Karl Caspar Haack (1722–25)."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:DBP 1976 908 Friederike Caroline Neuber.jpg|thumb|200px|Friederike Caroline Neuber as [[:de:Medea|Medea,]] [[:de:Briefmarken-Jahrgang 1976 der Deutschen Bundespost|stamp 1976]]|left]]

=== The Neuber Theatrical Troupe ===
In 1727, she and her husband founded their own [[acting troupe]] which became a "training ground for some of the great actor-managers to come”.&lt;ref name="Sharpe, Lesley 1995"&gt;Sharpe, Lesley. "Reform Of the German Theatre: Frau Neuber &amp; Frau Gottsched." Women in European Theatre. Ed. Elizabeth Woodrough. Oxford: Intellect, 1995. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year their company was "granted a patent by the elector of Saxony, [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony|Frederick Augustus I]], to perform at the [[Leipzig]] Easter Fair." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The troupe is recorded to have played in nineteen towns and cities as spread out as [[Warsaw]], [[Kiel]], and [[Strasburg, Germany|Strasburg]], most often in [[Dresden]], [[Hamburg]], and Leipzig.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The German Nachspiel in the Eighteenth Century|last=John|first=David Gethin|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no complete repertoire for the company exists there is an existing "detailed account of eight months in 1735, 8 April to 5 December" in which the troupe is listed to have performed "seventy-five 'Schauspiele' (a mixture of 'Tragödien' and 'Cömodien') in 203 performances."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, they are recorded to have performed ninety-three Nachspiele (a short play usually following a longer comedy or tragedy) in 107 performances during these eight months.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Neuber troupe has been described by historians as "a training ground for later principles" such as Heinrich Koch and Friedrich Schönemann, "each of whom founded his own troupe afterwards and enjoyed far more success than his mentor."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Partnership with J.C. Gottsched ===
As early as 1725, Neuber's acting technique had "attracted the attention of [[Johann Christoph Gottsched]], the critic and drama reformer who modeled his work on classical French tragedy and comedy."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Throughout her career, she was active in the introduction of the [[Theatre of France|French theatre]] in Germany, and worked closely with Gottsched and his wife, [[Luise Gottsched]], to elevate the status of German theatre. Gottsched was the first to call her "Die Neuberin."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Gottsched was important to the Neubers' company for he initiated in their company a "careful learning of parts and rehearsal for the heavily improvised [[farce]]s and [[harlequinade]]s that then dominated the German stage."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The theatrical partnership between Caroline Neuber and Johann Gottsched lasted until 1739 and is "usually regarded as the turning point in the history of German theatre and the start of modern German acting." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Banishment of Harlekin/Hanswurst ===
In 1736 Caroline Neuber came to Frankfurt with the intention to perform respectable theatre and set up her stage on the Liebfrauenberg.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Neubers pattern in 1736-7 was to play "major dramas of classical base of German imitations" while excluding the traditionally crude topics associated with the popular theatrical character [[Harlekin]] from their performances.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This demonstrated that a change in tone for theatre in Frankfurt was beginning, with the Neubers performances that were more respectable than the popular theatre revolving around Harlekin.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, it took more than Neuber's resolve to "change the taste and demands of most audiences of the day."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 1737, Neuber symbolically banished [[Hanswurst]] from the stage as part of her efforts to elevate the status of German theatre. The staged banishment has generally been regarded as an emblematic moment in German theatre history for the transition from popular, improvised, so-called "Stegreiftheater" to a modern bourgeois literary mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hanswurst and Herr Ich: Subjection and Abjection in Enlightenment Censorship of the Comic Figure |last=Jürs-Munby |first=Karen |page=125 |url=http://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/4232/1/download.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; These Hanswurt plays were created specifically for the enjoyment of male audiences.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Jurs-Munby, Karen. "Performing the Modern Self: German and French Discourses on Acting in the Enlightenment." Order No. 9983582 University of Minnesota, 2000. Ann Arbor: ''ProQuest.'' Web. 13 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period it was becoming more acceptable for women to pursue work as actresses; however, it was still unacceptable for women to work as managers of theatrical companies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Theatre historians of the late eighteenth century often described Caroline Neuber as one who had a masculine spirit and manly ambitions in order to reconcile what they viewed as “the disparity between her professional achievements and her gender role.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Partnership with Lessing ===
Caroline is attributed with discovering playwright [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], often considered by historians to be the first [[Dramaturge|dramaturg]]. After meeting Caroline, his interest in theatre grew. He translated several French plays for her and eventually wrote his first play, ''The Young Scholar'' which Neuber produced for him in 1748.[[File:Grab Friederike Caroline Neuber Dresden-Leuben.jpg|thumb|Friederike Caroline Neuber grave in the [[:de:Leuben|Leubener]] cemetery in Dresden]]

== Legacy ==
===''Caroline Neuber'' (play)===
''Caroline Neuber'', called ''Die Neubrin'' in many of its productions, is a biographical play written by [[Eberhard Keindorff]] and [[Günther Weisenborn|Gunther Weisenborn]] about Caroline Neuber's life.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Gladberry, Glen W. "Stages of Reform: Caroline Neuber/Die Neuberin in the Third Reich." ''Essays on Twentieth-Century German Drama and Theater: An American Reception 1977-1999''. Ed. Hellmut H. Rennert. New York: P. Lang, 2004. 167-75. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The play was created for actress [[Agnes Straub]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''Caroline Neuber'' premiered in the 1934/35 season in [[Nazi Germany|The Third Reich]] and was written as "the government consolidated its power and generated arts bureaucracies to oversee the publication, production, and response to plays."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The play was permitted publication in 1934 and premiered in Berlin in 1935. ''Caroline Neuber'' is unusual for its era, in which German theatre was censored by the [[Nazism|Nazis]], for the content of the play "challenges some of the basic cultural prejudices of the Third Reich."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:Caroline Neuber.JPG|thumb|Caroline Neuber monument in Dresden-[[:de:Laubegast|Laubegast]]|left]] By this point in history, Caroline Neuber was seen by theatre professionals as an important theatrical reformer of the 18th century.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because of this Keindorff and Weisenborn crafted a play about her life that served as a means for audiences to compare Neuber's reformation to the Nazi-directed theatrical reformation and thus, critique Nazi-theatre appropriately.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When analyzed, ''Caroline Neuber'' is interpreted as "a condemnation of the Third Reich itself." However, for those who had the power to censor theatre, Neuber's biography play was seen simply as a play about a famous actor, manager, and reformer that "complimented National Socialist reforms of the stage."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Nazis were initiating reforms to create what they saw as "new, honest, noble, wonderful German theatre."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because of this to "the general audience ''Die Neuberin'' was star biography; for the preferred audience, the reform stage of the past collided with the reforming stage of the present."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Caroline Neuber's legacy as not only an actress/manager but a reformer of the German stage served as a vehicle for Germans to learn from the past and critique the present.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Caroline Neuber Prize ===
This award commemorates Neuber's theatrical contributions to Germany. Since 1998, the city of Leipzig awards the Caroline Neuber Prize endowed with €6,000 every two years on her birthday in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leipzig.de/freizeit-kultur-und-tourismus/kunst-und-kultur/kunst-und-kulturpreise/caroline-neuber-preis/|title=Caroline Neuber Prize|first=|date=|website=Stadt Leipzig|publisher=|access-date=4 February 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize is awarded to a female theatre artist from a German-speaking country who sets new standards for excellence in theatre arts. Those who have been honored with the prize include Monika Gintersdorfer, [[Jutta Hoffmann]], [[Inge Keller]], Konstanze Lauterbach, Nele Hertling, Karin Henkel, [[Sasha Waltz]], and Ann-Elisabeth Wolff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leipzig.de/freizeit-kultur-und-tourismus/kunst-und-kultur/kunst-und-kulturpreise/caroline-neuber-preis/bisherige-preistraegerinnen/|title=Caroline Neuber Prize – Bisherige Preisträgerinnen|first=|date=|website=Stadt Leipzig|publisher=|access-date=4 February 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AC._Documentos_de_actividad_contemporánea._1931,_n.º_1.pdf|thumb|Copy of GATEPAC's journal]]
[[Image:Donostia Aizpurua Klub Nautikoa.jpg|thumb|''[[w:es:Club Náutico de San Sebastián|Club Náutico de San Sebastián]]'' (1929) designed by [[José Manuel Aizpúrua]] and [[Joaquín Labayen]]]]
'''GATEPAC''' (Grupo de Artistas y Técnicos Españoles Para la Arquitectura Contemporánea) was a group of architects assembled during the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Its most important members were: [[Josep Lluís Sert]], [[Antoni Bonet Castellana]], [[Josep Torres Clavé]], [[José Manuel Aizpurúa]], [[Fernando García Mercadal]] and [[Sixte Illescas]].

The group was formed in the 1930s as a Spanish branch of [[C.I.A.M.]] The Eastern (Catalan) and founding section of the group, called [[GATCPAC]] (Grup d'Arquitectes i Tècnics Catalans per al Progrés de l'Arquitectura Contemporània) was much more successful than the Central or Northern sections, and carried out government contracts during the Second Republic.  GATCPAC also published the magazine ''A.C.'', or ''Actividad Contemporánea'', which remains an important document for the history of Modern Movement in Spain.

Most, but not all GATEPAC members fought on the Republican side during the [[Spanish Civil War]].  Torres Clavé was killed in action.  [[Josep Lluís Sert]] went into exile in the United States, where he would teach at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]].  Antoni Bonet established himself in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Having been associated with the Second Republic, GATEPAC was taboo in [[Francoist Spain]] and reference to it was often censored until the 1950s, when their works were taken up by a new generation of Spanish modern architects like the Catalan [[Oriol Bohigas]].

| quote = [...] the study of the geological foundation to human myths, an emerging discipline in the Earth sciences galled 'geomythology'. This term was coined by Dorothy Vitaliano, in her pioneering book ''Legends of the Earth: their geologic origins'' (1973), as, 'the study of the actual geologic origins of natural phenomena which were long explained in terms of myth and folklore'.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Geomythology indicates every case in which the origin of [[mythology|myths]] and [[legend]]s can be shown to contain references to geological phenomena and aspects, in a broad sense including astronomical ones (comets, eclipses, meteor impacts, etc.). As indicated by Vitaliano (1973) 'primarily, there are two kinds of geologic [[folklore]], that in which some geologic feature or the occurrence of some geologic phenomenon has inspired a folklore explanation, and that which is the garbled explanation of some actual geologic event, usually a natural catastrophe'."{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The claim is that oral traditions about nature are often expressed in mythological language and may contain genuine and perceptive natural knowledge based on careful observation of physical evidence. Geomythology alleges to provide valuable information about past [[earthquake]]s, [[tsunami]]s, [[flood]]s, [[impact event]]s, [[fossil]] discoveries, and other events, which are otherwise scientifically unknown or difficult to trace.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

To be distinguished from this are plainly [[aitiological]] tales that account for geological features without any connection to their formation; for example: the Native American legend of a giant bear chasing a couple who were saved when the land rose beneath their feet; the bear's claws left gouge marks on the sides of the uplift known today as [[Devils Tower National Monument|Devils Tower]], [[Wyoming]].

In August 2004 the 32nd International Geological Congress held a session on "Myth and Geology",&lt;ref&gt;"A Legendary Session: Myth and Geology", 32nd IGC Informs, ([http://www.32igc.org/stampa/32igc%20informs6%20.pdf Full text])&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the first peer-reviewed collection of papers on the subject (2007).&lt;ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Ikiru'''''|生きる||"To Live"}} is a 1952 Japanese [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed and co-written by [[Akira Kurosawa]] and starring [[Takashi Shimura]]. The film examines the struggles of a terminally ill [[Tokyo]] bureaucrat and his final quest for meaning. The screenplay was partly inspired by [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s 1886 novella ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]''.

The major themes of the film include learning how to live, the inefficiency of [[bureaucracy]], and decaying family life in Japan, which have been the subject of analysis by academics and critics. The film has received widespread critical acclaim, and in Japan won awards for Best Film at the [[Kinema Junpo]] and [[Mainichi Film Awards]]. It was remade as a television film in 2007.

==Plot==
Kanji Watanabe is a [[middle-aged]] man who has worked in the same monotonous [[bureaucrat]]ic position for thirty years. His wife is dead and his son and daughter-in-law, who live with him, seem to care mainly about Watanabe's pension and their future inheritance. At work, he's a party to constant bureaucratic inaction. In one case, a group of parents are seemingly endlessly referred to one department after another when they want a cesspool cleared out and replaced by a [[playground]]. After learning he has [[stomach cancer]] and less than a year to live, Watanabe attempts to come to terms with his impending death. He plans to tell his son about the cancer, but decides against it when his son does not pay attention to him. He then tries to find escape in the pleasures of Tokyo's nightlife, guided by an eccentric novelist whom he has just met. In a nightclub, Watanabe requests a song from the piano player, and sings "[[Gondola no Uta]]" with great sadness. His singing greatly affects those watching him. After one night submerged in the nightlife, he realizes this is not the solution.

The following day, Watanabe encounters a young female subordinate, Toyo, who needs his signature on her resignation. He takes comfort in observing her joyous love of life and enthusiasm and tries to spend as much time as possible with her. She eventually becomes suspicious of his intentions and grows weary of him. After convincing her to join him for the last time, he opens up and asks for the secret to her love of life. She says that she does not know, but that she found happiness in her new job making toys, which makes her feel like she is playing with all the children of Japan. Inspired by her, Watanabe realizes that it is not too late for him to do something significant. Like Toyo, he wants to make something, but is unsure what he can do within the city bureaucracy until he remembers the lobbying for a playground. He surprises everyone by returning to work after a long absence, and begins pushing for a playground despite concerns he is intruding on the jurisdiction of other departments.

Watanabe dies, and at his wake, his former co-workers gather, after the opening of the playground, and try to figure out what caused such a dramatic change in his behavior. His transformation from listless bureaucrat to passionate advocate puzzles them. As the co-workers drink, they slowly realize that Watanabe must have known he was dying, even when his son denies this, as he was unaware of his father's condition. They also hear from a witness that in the last few moments in Watanabe's life, he sat on the swing at the park he built. As the snow fell, he sang "Gondola no Uta". The bureaucrats vow to live their lives with the same dedication and passion as he did. But back at work, they lack the courage of their newfound conviction.

==Themes==

===Living===
Death is a major theme in the film, which leads to the protagonist Watanabe's quest to find the meaning of life.&lt;ref name="Sesonske"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/839-ikiru |title=Ikiru |last=Sesonske |first=Alexander |date=19 November 1990 |accessdate=19 December 2016 |work=[[The Criterion Collection]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Watanabe looks to nightclubs and women to live life to the fullest, but winds up singing the 1915 song "[[Gondola no Uta]]" as an expression of loss.{{sfn|Thomas|2011}} Professor Alexander Sesonske writes that in the nightclub scene, Watanabe realizes "pleasure is not life," and that a goal gives him new happiness, with the song "[[Happy Birthday to You]]" symbolizing his rebirth.&lt;ref name="Sesonske"/&gt; Because Toyo is young, she has the best insight as to how to live, and is presented as the "unlikely savior" in Watanabe's "redemption."{{sfn|Thomas|2011}}

Author [[Donald Richie]] wrote that the title of the film, meaning simply "to live," could signify that "existence is enough." However, Watanabe finds existence is painful, and takes this as inspiration, wanting to ensure his life has not been futile. The justification of his life, found in his park, is how Watanabe discovered how "to live."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/307-ikiru |title=Ikiru |last=Richie |first=Donald |date=5 January 2004 |accessdate=19 December 2016 |work=[[The Criterion Collection]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yamada|first=Seiji|last2=Maskarinec|first2=Gregory|last3=Greene|first3=Gordon|date=2003|title=Cross-Cultural Ethics and the Moral Development of Physicians:  Lessons from Kurosawa’s Ikiru.|url=https://www.stfm.org/fmhub/fm2003/mar03/lame.pdf|journal=Family Medicine|volume=35|pages=167–169|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Watanabe now sings "Gondola no Uta" with great contentment.{{sfn|Thomas|2011}}

===Bureaucracy===
''Ikiru'' is also an "indictment of [[Civil service of Japan|Japanese bureaucracy]]."&lt;ref name="Sesonske"/&gt; In Japan after [[World War II]], it was expected that the [[sararīman]] (salary man) would work predictably in accordance with an organization's rules.{{sfn|Brannigan|2009|p=347}} The scene where the mothers first visit the city office requesting a playground shows "unconcern" in the bureaucrats, who send the visitors on a "farcical runaround," before asking them for a written request, with paperwork in the film symbolizing "meaningless activity."{{sfn|Brannigan|2009|p=354-355}} Despite this, Watanabe uses the bureaucracy to forge his legacy, and is apparently not disturbed when the bureaucracy quickly forgets he drove the project to build the playground.{{sfn|Lucken|2016|p=113}}

[[Health care system in Japan|Japanese health care]] is also depicted as overly bureaucratic in the film, as Watanabe visits a clinic in a "poignant" scene.{{sfn|Brannigan|2009|p=345}} The doctor is portrayed as paternalistic, and Watanabe does not stand up to his authority.{{sfn|Brannigan|2009|p=355}}

===Family life===
Author Timothy Iles writes that, as with [[Yasujirō Ozu]]'s 1953 film ''[[Tokyo Story]]'', ''Ikiru'' may hold a negative view about the state of family life in modern Japan. Watanabe has lived with his son for years, but they have fallen out of any true relationship. His son, Mitsuo, sees Watanabe as a bother, and sees him as standing in the way of money in Watanabe's [[will and testament|will]].{{sfn|Iles|2008|p=83}} The children fall short of their responsibility to respect their parents.{{sfn|Iles|2008|p=84}}

Urbanization may be a reason for negative changes in Japanese society, although a reason for Watanabe and Mitsuo's drift is also Watanabe's preoccupation with work.{{sfn|Iles|2008|p=84}} Another reason is Watanabe not being with Mitsuo during a medical treatment when the boy was 10, which fits a pattern in Kurosawa's films of sons being overly harsh to their fathers.{{sfn|Vicari|2016|p=72}}

==Production==

The film marked the first collaboration between director [[Akira Kurosawa]] and screenwriter [[Hideo Oguni]]. According to Oguni, the genesis of the film was Kurosawa's desire to make a film about a man who knows he is going to die, and wants a reason to live for a short time.&lt;ref name="Mcgee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/290046%7c0/Ikiru.html|title=Ikiru |last=McGee |first=Scott |date=|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oguni was an experienced writer and was offered ¥500,000, while co-writer [[Shinobu Hashimoto]] was offered ¥150,000.  Initially, Kurosawa told Hashimoto that a man who was set to die in 75 days had to be the theme, and that the character's career was less important, with the director saying criminal, homeless man or government minister would be acceptable.{{sfn|Hashimoto|2015}}

The screenwriters consulted [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s novella ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]'', and Oguni envisioned placing Watanabe's death halfway through the film.&lt;ref name="Mcgee"/&gt; Kurosawa dictated the scene where Watanabe is on the swing, and mentioned the beginning lyrics of "[[Gondola no Uta]]." Since none of the men were familiar with the song, they consulted their eldest receptionist on the rest of the lyrics and the song title.{{sfn|Hashimoto|2015}}

Kurosawa renamed the draft ''The Life of Kanji Watanabe'' to ''Ikiru'', which Hashimoto found pretentious, but Oguni supported. The screenplay was completed on 5 February 1952.{{sfn|Hashimoto|2015}}

==Release==
In Japan, [[Toho]] released the film on 9 October 1952.{{sfn|Galbraith|2008|p=88}} The film was also screened in the [[4th Berlin International Film Festival|1954 Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Berlinale 1954"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1954/02_programm_1954/02_Programm_1954.html |title=PROGRAMME 1954 |accessdate=18 December 2016 |work=[[Berlin International Film Festival]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the film was shown for a short time in California in 1956, under the title ''Doomed''.&lt;ref name="Mcgee"/&gt; It opened as ''Ikiru'' in [[New York City]] on 29 January 1960.&lt;ref name="Crowther"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0DE1DA143EEF3ABC4850DFB766838B679EDE |title=Screen: Drama Imported From Japan:'Ikiru' Has Premiere at the Little Carnegie Shimura Stars as Petty Government Aide |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |date=30 January 1960 |accessdate=18 December 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film poster featured the [[stripper]] seen briefly in the film, rather than Watanabe.&lt;ref name="Mcgee"/&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
[[File:Ikiru 1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Takashi Shimura]] as Kanji Watanabe in the iconic scene.]]
The film won critical approval upon its release.{{sfn|Lucken|2016|p=108}} [[Bosley Crowther]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', called it "a strangely fascinating and affecting film, up to a point—that being the point where it consigns its aged hero to the great beyond," which he deemed "anti-climactic." Crowther praised Shimura, saying he "measures up through his performance in this picture with the top film actors anywhere," and complimented Miki Odagiri, Nobuo Kaneko and Yunosuke Ito.&lt;ref name="Crowther"/&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' staff called the film "a tour-de-force," by "keeping a dramatic thread throughout and avoiding the mawkish."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1951/film/reviews/ikiru-1200417247/ |title=Review: 'Ikiru' |last=Variety Staff |first= |date=31 December 1951 |accessdate=18 December 2016 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] added it to his list of [[The Great Movies|Great Movies]] in 1996, saying, "Over the years I have seen ''Ikiru'' every five years or so, and each time it has moved me, and made me think.

==Legacy==
Kurosawa believed [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Macbeth]]'' could serve as a [[cautionary tale]] complementing ''Ikiru'', thus directing his 1957 film ''[[Throne of Blood]]''.{{sfn|Richie|1998|p=115}} ''Ikiru'' was remade as a Japanese [[television film]] that debuted on [[TV Asahi]] on 9 September 2007, the day after a remake of Kurosawa's ''[[High and Low (1963 film)|High and Low]]''. The ''Ikiru'' remake stars [[kabuki]] actor [[Matsumoto Kōshirō IX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2007/09/02/tv/environmental-celebrity-special-celebrity-comeback-special-kurosawa-classic-adaptation/#.WFdx__krLIU |title=Environmental celebrity special, celebrity comeback special, Kurosawa classic adaptation |last= |first= |date=2 September 2007 |accessdate=18 December 2016 |work=[[The Japan Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Anand (1971 film)|Anand]]'', a 1971 [[Cinema of India|Indian]] [[Hindi film]], was loosely inspired by ''Ikiru''.{{sfn|Raghavendra|2014|p=200}} In 2003, [[DreamWorks]] attempted to make a U.S. remake, which would star [[Tom Hanks]] in the lead role, and talked to [[Richard Price (writer)|Richard Price]] about adapting the screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2003/film/markets-festivals/price-right-for-ikiru-1117883385/ |title=Price right for 'Ikiru' |last=Fleming |first=Michael |date=24 March 2003 |accessdate=18 December 2016 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jim Sheridan]] agreed to direct the film in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/markets-festivals/irish-eyes-smile-on-dreamworks-ikiru-remake-1117910213/ |title=Irish eyes smile on DreamWorks' 'Ikiru' remake |last1=Fleming |first1=Michael |last2=LaPorte |first2=Nicole |date=9 September 2004 |accessdate=18 December 2016 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it has not been produced.

She has a BA from Syracuse University and an MA and PhD in literature from Columbia University and is a former Mellon Foundation Post-Doctoral Fellow of Environmental Humanities at Wellesley College.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thewarehousegallery.syr.edu/main/artists.html/ Warehouse Gallery Artists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205125640/http://thewarehousegallery.syr.edu/main/artists.html/ |date=2014-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her writing is published by scholarly journals, literary magazines, and popular periodicals alike, including [[North American Review]], Asian American Literary Review, American Scientist, Leonardo, [[Hyperallergic]], and Rhizome. As co-founder of the [[EcoArtTech]] art-media collaborative with artist [[Cary Peppermint]], Leila has presented creative projects and workshops at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], the New Museum, and the Neuberger Museum, and gives regular lectures worldwide. She currently teaches humanities courses in the Sustainability and Media Studies programs of the University of Rochester.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rhizome.org/profiles/Leila_Christine_Nadir/ Rhizome.org Profile ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205072047/http://rhizome.org/profiles/Leila_Christine_Nadir/ |date=2014-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leila's recently published memoir work revolves around her mixed-ethnicity upbringing and the colorful marriage of her Afghan, Muslim father and Slovak, Catholic mother, who together raised seven children. She credits her parents' marriage for her "high tolerance for insanity" and lack of tolerance for all sentimental clichés, especially about bicultural experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aalrmag.org/mixedraceissuenadir/ Interview with Zohra Saed in Asian American Literary Review. ]&lt;/ref&gt; She is a member of the NYC-based Afghan American Artists and Writers Association.&lt;ref&gt;[https://afghanamericanwriters.wordpress.com/about/ Afghan American Artists and Writers Association Members]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Low technology''', often abbreviated '''low tech''' (adjective forms '''low-technology''', '''low-tech''', '''lo-tech''') is simple technology, often of a traditional or non-mechanical kind, such as [[crafts]] and [[tool]]s that pre-date the [[Industrial Revolution]]. It is the opposite of [[high technology]].

Low technology can typically be practised or fabricated with a minimum of [[capital (economics)|capital]] investment by an individual or small group of individuals. Also, the knowledge of the practice can be completely comprehended by a single individual, free from increasing [[Departmentalization|specialization]] and [[wikt:compartmentalization|compartmentalization]]. Low-tech techniques and designs may fall into disuse due to changing socio-economic conditions or priorities.

==Examples of low technology==

'''Note:''' almost all of the entries in this section should be prefixed by the word ''traditional''.

* [[weaving]] produced on non-automated looms, and [[basketry]].
* hand [[wood-working]], [[joiner]]y, [[coopering]], and [[carpentry]].
* the trade of the [[shipwright|ship-wright]].
* the trade of the [[Wheelwright|wheel-wright]].
* the trade of the [[wainwright]]: making wagons. (the Latin word for a two-wheeled ''wagon'' is ''carpentum'', the maker of which was a ''carpenter''.)

(''Wright'' is the [[agent form]] of the word ''wrought'', which itself is the original [[past passive participle]] of the word ''work'', now superseded by the [[Light verb|weak verb]] forms ''worker'' and ''worked'' respectively.)

* [[blacksmithing]] and the various related [[smithing]] and metal-crafts.
* [[folk music]] played on [[acoustic instruments]].
* [[mathematics]] (particularly, ''[[pure mathematics]]'')
* [[organic farming]] and [[animal husbandry]] (i.e.; agriculture as practiced by all American farmers prior to World War II).
* [[Mill (grinding)|milling]] in the sense of operating hand-constructed equipment with the intent to either grind grain, or the reduction of timber to lumber as practiced in a [[saw-mill]].
* [[fulling]], [[felt]]ing, [[spindle (textiles)|drop spindle]] spinning, [[hand knitting]], [[crochet]], &amp; similar textile preparation.
* the production of [[charcoal]] by the [[Charcoal maker|collier]], for use in [[home heating]], [[foundry]] operations, [[smelting]], the various [[smithing]] trades, and for brushing ones teeth as in [[Colonial America]].
* [[glass-blowing]].
* various subskills of [[food preservation]]:
** [[Smoking (food)|smoking]]
** [[salting (food)|salting]]
** [[pickling]]
** [[drying (food)|drying]]

'''Note''': [[home canning]] is a counter example of a '''low technology''' since some of the supplies needed to pursue this skill rely on a [[global trade network]] and an existing manufacturing [[infrastructure]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

* the production of various [[alcoholic beverage]]s:
** [[wine]]: poorly preserved fruit juice.
** [[beer]]: a way to preserve the calories of grain products from decay.
** [[whiskey]]: an improved ([[distilled]]) form of beer.
* [[flint-knapping]]
* [[masonry]] as used in [[castles]], [[cathedrals]], and [[root cellar]]s.

==Legal status of low-technology==
{{See also|Handicraft|Organic food|Natural foods}}
By federal law in the United States, only those articles produced with little or no use of machinery or tools with complex mechanisms may be stamped with the designation "hand-wrought" or "hand-made". Lengthy court-battles are currently underway over the precise definition of the terms "organic" and "natural" as applied to [[foodstuff]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Groups associated with low-technology==
* [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], popularized by [[Gustav Stickley]] in America around 1900.
* [[Bauhaus]] movement of Germany around the same time.
* [[Do-It-Yourself]] phenomenon arising in America following [[World War II]].
* [[Back-to-the-land movement]] beginning in America during the 1960s.
* [[Luddites]], whose activities date to the very beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]].
* Living history and [[open-air museum]]s around the world, which strive to recreate bygone societies.
* [[Simple living]] adherents, such as the [[Amish]] and to a lesser extent some sects of the [[Mennonites]], who specifically refuse some newer technologies to avoid undesirable effects on themselves or their societies.
* [[Survivalists]] are often proponents,{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} since low-technology is inherently more [[:wikt:robust|robust]] than its [[high-technology]] counterpart.

'''Malcolm''' "'''Mal'''" '''Reynolds''' is a [[fictional character]] and the [[protagonist]] of the [[Firefly (franchise)|''Firefly'' franchise]]. Mal is played by actor [[Nathan Fillion]] in the 2002 [[TV series]] [[Firefly (TV series)|''Firefly'']] and the 2005 film ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]''. In the series, Mal is a former [[Browncoat]] [[sergeant]] and the captain of the [[Serenity (Firefly vessel)|"''Firefly''-class" spaceship ''Serenity'']]. The character was named #18 in ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'s}} Greatest Sci-Fi Legends list in 2004.&lt;ref name="legend"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whedonesque.com/comments/4511 |title=Captain Mal Reynolds features in '25 Greatest Sci-fi legends' list |website=Whedonesque.com |date=July 27, 2004 |author=Simon |accessdate=July 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production details==
Conceived by [[Joss Whedon]], the character Malcolm Reynolds was the only definite character he had in mind when formulating the ensemble cast. He wanted a hero, but not a hero in the classic sense; someone that is "everything that a hero is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/03/the-10-greatest-anti-heroes-5-malcolm-reynolds.html |title=The 10 Greatest Anti-Heroes: #5 Malcolm Reynolds |magazine=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |date=March 17, 2010 |accessdate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the proposed pilot, Mal was much darker and considerably more closed-off. Fox network executives objected, and asked that Mal be "lightened up". For the second episode ("[[The Train Job]]"), Whedon created a more "jolly" Mal Reynolds.&lt;ref&gt;Whedon, ''Train Job: Director's Commentary,'' Track 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Fillion shares his view on the motivations of the character he portrayed. Mal has lost so much that each character in the crew he has gathered on ''Serenity'' represents an aspect of himself he no longer has. "In Wash, he has a lust for life and a sense of humor he's lost. In Jayne, he has selfishness. In Book, he has spirituality. In Kaylee, he has innocence. Everybody represents a facet of himself that he has lost and that's why he keeps them close and safe, and yet at arm's length."&lt;ref name="FFC26"/&gt;

===Casting===
The role was originally written for ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' co-star [[Nicholas Brendon]] (who played [[Xander Harris]]);&lt;ref&gt;Q&amp;A with Nicholas Brendan&amp;nbsp;— Supanova Convention in Sydney, Australia - 13 October 2007, also Q&amp;A with Nicholas Brendan - Armageddon Expo in Melbourne, Australia - 23 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2018}} however, the shooting schedule conflicted with his commitment to ''Buffy''.

Whedon approached Nathan Fillion to play the lead, and after explaining the premise and showing Fillion the treatment for the pilot, Fillion was eager for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whedon.info/article.php3?id_article=1531&amp;img= |title=Interview with Nathan Fillion&amp;nbsp;— Dreamwatch Magazine 107 |website=Whedon.info |date=September 9, 2003 |accessdate=July 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fillion was called back several times to read for the part before he was cast. He noted that "It was really thrilling. It was my first lead and I was pretty nervous, but I really wanted that part and I wanted to tell those stories."&lt;ref name="FFC26"&gt;Whedon, ''Firefly Companion, Vol 1'', p.26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costume design===
Los Angeles prop shop Applied Effects was approached by Randy Erikson to create Mal's main gun, a "Moses Brothers Self-Defense Engine Frontier Model B",&lt;ref name="scifi"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/cool/sfw17440.html |title=Official Malcolm Reynolds Stunt Pistol |first=Sean |last=Huxter |website=[[Scifi.com]] |date=October 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130182729/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/cool/sfw17440.html |archivedate=November 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gave them a week and a half. Erikson provided a foamcore conceptual mockup and the base guns, one of which was a five-shot .38 [[caliber]] [[Taurus Model 85]] revolver. Erikson researched [[American Civil War]]-era revolvers for inspiration and the final mockup had a brass or bronze look, with the revolver a little elongated. The biggest challenge was masking the shape of the original revolver and still keeping it operable.&lt;ref&gt;Whedon, ''Firefly Companion, Vol 1'', pp.79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the TV series ''Firefly'', a cast [[bronze]] pistol was used, but for the film ''Serenity'', a more detailed replica was created which had moving [[firearm action|action]] and a [[Blank (cartridge)#Applications|blank pistol]] hidden inside, so that it could be fired in [[close-up]]s. Since this version was quite heavy, a [[resin]] replica was also constructed, which in addition to being less tiring for the actors to carry, could be thrown or dropped with less fear of injury.&lt;ref name="quant"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.quantummechanix.com/IN%20THE%20WORKS/4C9CB708-01B9-4E9F-A5F7-3FCE0DED9598.html |title=The Metal Mal Hero Pistol Replica |website=Quantummechanix.com |date=September 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210062342/http://www.quantummechanix.com/IN%20THE%20WORKS/4C9CB708-01B9-4E9F-A5F7-3FCE0DED9598.html |archivedate=December 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonfunctional replicas of the gun are commercially available for [[fan (person)|fans]] and [[Collecting|collectors]].&lt;ref name="scifi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="quant"/&gt;

GBB Custom Gunleather was tasked with creating Mal's gun holster, which was made out of oak-tanned carving leather.&lt;ref&gt;Whedon, ''Firefly Companion, Vol 1'', p.81.&lt;/ref&gt; The character's coat, a relic of his time as a [[Browncoat]], was a collaboration between Firefly costume designer [[Shawna Trpcic]] and Jonathan A. Logan, a leather artist. Trpcic sketched her idea and a cloth mockup was created before the final was made with domestic-farmed deerskin. The cuffs are actually the sleeves folded back, evoking the style of Oriental robes with their silk linings. Two coats were made for the character, one called "Number 1" coat and another called "The Hero" coat. The Number 1 coat's bullet hole is drawn in, while The Hero version has a detailed cut and sewn repair.&lt;ref&gt;Whedon, ''Firefly Companion, Vol 1'', p.83.&lt;/ref&gt; As with the gun, replicas of Malcolm Reynolds' coat have also been made available commercially for fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://abbyshot.blogspot.com/2009/11/browncoat-launched-aim-to-misbehave.html  |title=The Malcolm Reynolds Browncoat Replica |website=AbbyShot Blog |date=November 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character biography==
Malcolm's main mission is to keep his crew alive and to keep his ship flying. As ''Firefly'' writer Tim Minear stated in an interview: "It's just about getting by. That's always been the mission statement of what the show is&amp;nbsp;— getting by."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Mal was raised by his mother and "about 40 hands" on a ranch on the planet Shadow.&lt;ref&gt;Whedon, ''Firefly: the complete series: "Our Mrs. Reynolds"''&lt;/ref&gt; Though Mal usually seems more practical than intellectual, he occasionally surprises his friends by displaying familiarity with disparate literature varying from the works of [[Xiang Yu]]&lt;ref&gt;Whedon, ''Firefly: the complete series: "War Stories"''&lt;/ref&gt; to [[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner|poems]]&lt;ref name="Whedon, Serenity, DVD"/&gt; by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], though he has no idea "who" [[Mona Lisa]] is.

Mal volunteered for the [[Browncoat|Independents]] army during the Unification War against the [[Alliance (Firefly)|Alliance]], gaining the rank of sergeant during that time. His loyal second-in-command [[Zoe Washburne|Zoe]] was by his side for most of the war, surviving many dangerous conflicts with him. The show mentions three such battles, including the Battle of Du-Khang in 2510 (featured in "[[The Message (Firefly)|The Message]]") and a long winter campaign in New Kashmir (as told by Zoe in "[[War Stories (Firefly episode)|War Stories]]") where he commanded a platoon. Mal was also involved in the ground campaign during the Battle of Sturges (as seen in the comic book ''[[Serenity: Those Left Behind]]''), which according to [[List of minor characters in Firefly#Badger|Badger]] was the "bloodiest and shortest battle in all the war", although Mal considers it a distant second. Mal fought in many more battles, but the turning point for him and the Independents came with their physical and emotional defeat at the ''Battle of Serenity Valley'' on the planet [[List of Firefly planets and moons#Hera|Hera]]. On-screen information in ''Serenity'' shows him to have been attached to the 57th Overlanders Brigade; in the series pilot, Badger calls it the "Balls and Bayonets Brigade", though it is unclear whether this was a disparaging nickname coined by Badger himself or the actual unit [[sobriquet]] (A deleted scene in ''Serenity'' marks it as the actual unit nickname.  It is unknown if the deleted scene can be considered canon or not.)

After the war, Mal acquired his own ship, a derelict 03-K64 ''Firefly''-class transport. Mal named the ship ''Serenity'' after the Battle of Serenity Valley, the decisive battle of the Unification War.

==Reception==
Fillion won the "Cinescape Genre Face of the Future Award&amp;nbsp;— Male" award by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films, USA for his role as Malcolm Reynolds. Fillion also won the [[SyFy Genre Awards]] in 2006 for ''Best Actor/Television'' and was runner-up for ''Best Actor/Movie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://syfyportal.com/news.php?id=2895 |title=SyfyPortal Awards |accessdate=October 8, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107100529/http://www.syfyportal.com/news.php?id=2895 |archivedate=November 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character was named #18 in ''[[TV Guide]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s "Greatest Sci-fi legends" list in 2004.&lt;ref name="legend" /&gt; In 2008, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' ranked Mal as #34 on their list of the 100 Greatest Movie Characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.empireonline.com/100-greatest-movie-characters/default.asp?c=51 |title=The 100 Greatest Movie Characters |magazine=Empire |accessdate=June 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, ''[[SFX (magazine)|SFX Magazine]]'' voted Mal Reynolds #1 on their Top 100 Sci-Fi icons of the century.

In her review of the film ''Serenity'' for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Manohla Dargis]] had this to say about the character and Nathan Fillion: "Mal is no [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] redux; he's closer to [[Indiana Jones]], if absent [[Harrison Ford]]'s rakishly handsome looks and star magnetism. Like the rest of the cast, Mr. Fillion is a charming performer, but he borrows rather than owns the screen, which dovetails with Mr. Whedon's modest aspirations for this film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dargis |first=Manohla |date=September 30, 2005 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/30/movies/scruffy-space-cowboys-fighting-their-failings.html |title=Scruffy Space Cowboys Fighting Their Failings |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mission Dolores mural''' is an 18th-century work of art in the [[Mission San Francisco de Asís]], the oldest surviving structure in [[San Francisco]].  In 1791, the [[Ohlone people]], Native Americans of the [[San Francisco Bay]] and laborers for the church, painted the mural on the focal wall of the sanctuary.  Five years later, an altarpiece known as a [[reredos]], was constructed in front of the mural, blocking it from view for more than two centuries.  The mural remained mostly unseen in the intervening years, decaying slowly as it was protected from light and moisture behind the reredos enclosure.&lt;ref name="aia"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[Archaeological Institute of America]] |date=May–June 2004 |url=http://www.archaeology.org/0405/newsbriefs/heart.html |title=Saved by Neglect |volume=57 |issue=3 |journal=[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]] |page=11 |issn=0003-8113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, archaeologist Eric Blind and artist [[Ben Wood]] digitized the mural, allowing the public to view it for the first time.  Painted on plaster, the mural is adorned with abstract patterns and [[Christian art|Christian imagery]], in ochre, white, red, yellow, black, and blue/grey colors.  The mural is an historically significant work of art from the early era of [[Spanish missions in California]] (1769–1833),&lt;ref name="spark" /&gt; and is considered "the best-preserved example of art from the period of first contact with Europeans".&lt;ref name="Nolte"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Nolte |first=Carl |date=2004-01-29 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/01/29/MNGC74KEA71.DTL#ixzz0z25ir2Bi |title=Centuries-old murals revealed in Mission Dolores |publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The construction of adobe walls for the mission church began in 1788 with the manufacture of 36,000 bricks by native laborers. By 1790 the walls were completed, plastered, and whitewashed. It is most likely between this time and the dedication of the church on August 2, 1791 that the mural was painted.  The mural covers the entirety of the rear wall of the church, behind the historic wooden altar. It measures 22 by 20 feet and includes two statuary niches. It was eclipsed in the year 1796 by an impressive baroque-style relief sculpture shipped from San Blas, Mexico, called a ''[[reredos]]''. A reredos is often wooden with niches and holds statues or paintings. This reredos continues to stand as the backdrop to the mission altar and has concealed the wall painting for over 200 years.&lt;ref name="spark"&gt;{{Cite web|author=KQED Arts |date=Jan 2005 |url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/programs/spark/profile.jsp?essid=4210 |title=Spark: Ben Wood |publisher=''[[KQED (TV)|KQED]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; For about five years before the mural was covered by the ornate wooden reredos, friars, soldiers, and native people saw the mural each day.
[[File:sacredheart2.jpg|thumb|300px|Detail of Sacred Heart pierced by three daggers]]

Part of the mural depicts the [[Sacred Heart]]s of Jesus and Mary.  In [[Christian art]], the Sacred Heart is often portrayed as a flaming heart shining with [[Light (theology)|divine light]], pierced by the lance-wound, surrounded by a crown of thorns, surmounted by a cross and bleeding. Sometimes the image is over Jesus' body with his wounded hands pointing at the heart. The wounds and crown of thorns allude to the manner of Jesus' death, while the fire represents the transformative power of love.  In the Mission Dolores mural, the Sacred Heart appears on either side of the upper third of the mural, with a decorative recessed wall, or statuary niche, in the center, decorated at the top with a shell motif. The upper niche is richly ornamented with scroll motifs and flanked on either side with more scrolling decorative patterns. The interior of the lower niche is less decorative and painted in red. Similar ornamental motifs are found elsewhere in the old mission on the archway above the sanctuary, as well as chevron patterns on the ceiling. We know these are original native patterns as we see the same pattern in the original basketry woven by local native women over 200 years ago. According to the California Missions Foundation some of the design resembles traditional Ohlone patterns found on rock art in the region.&lt;ref name="cmf"&gt;{{Cite web |author=California Missions Foundation |url=http://www.californiamissionsfoundation.org/mission-san-francisco-de-asis.html |title=Mission San Francisco de Asís ("Mission Dolores") |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505165610/http://www.californiamissionsfoundation.org/mission-san-francisco-de-asis.html |archivedate=2011-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the mission church behind the huge canvas depicting the last supper there are also decorative patterns painted on the wall.

A defining factor in the preservation of the mural over the centuries is the mural's situation in a dark, cramped space behind the historic reredos. The mural is situated on a wall about two feet behind the reredos. It is only partially visible from an oblique angle through a trap door that opens from the attic above.

Certain areas of the mural have deteriorated over time, particularly a section at the top of the mural that has been severely abraded, possibly when an electrical cable was installed in front of the mural.  Besides being an engaging piece of art, the mural is an intriguing artifact from a seemingly remote past. An artifact which silently stood witness for five years as a few missionaries on the frontier edge of an extended empire endeavored to convert the numerous native peoples to Catholicism and a Spanish colonial vision of civilization.

==Historical accounts==
English captain and geographer [[George Vancouver]] was the first foreign visitor to sail into colonial San Francisco.  He made two trips to San Francisco in 1792 and 1793. Vancouver's praising account of the church is one of the few remarks available from the brief period the mural was displayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Engelhardt |first=Zephyrin |authorlink=Zephyrin Engelhardt |year=1924 |url=http://www.sfmission.com/cgi-bin/gallery/imageFolio.cgi?action=view&amp;link=San_Francisco/Mission_District/History/Birthplace_of_the_SF_Bay_Area/Ohlone_Indians&amp;image=Ohlone-mission_dolores.jpg&amp;img=&amp;tt= |title=San Francisco or Mission Dolores |location=Chicago |publisher=Franciscan Herald Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;...the church, which for its magnitude and architecture and internal decorations, did great credit to the constructors of it....the raising and decorating of this edifice appeared to have greatly attracted the attention of the Fathers, and the comforts they might have provided in their humble habitation, seemed to have been totally sacrificed to their accomplishment of this favorite object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Vancouver |first=George |authorlink=George Vancouver |editor=Joshua Paddison |year=1999 |chapter=from A Voyage of Discovery to the North Pacific Ocean |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=WEQ6sIjuS6cC&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A World Transformed: Firsthand Accounts of California Before the Gold Rush |publisher=Heyday Books |isbn=1-890771-13-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Rediscovery and archaeology==
[[File:missionbasilica.jpg|thumb|300px|Photo of projection of Sacred Hearts onto basilica dome, January 23 to February 7, 2004]]

During work on the church's exterior walls in 1918, a policeman, Charles Fennell, discovered a frieze in the old sacristy: "Fennell, watching workmen engaged in buttressing the walls of the building, had his attention attracted by streaks of color flashing from pealing kalsomine on what was once the interior of the old sacristy ... one of the details looked like a horse shoe, and what resembled a hand or a running or gesticulating figure of man could also be discerned."&lt;ref name="sfe1918"&gt;{{Cite news |date=June 19, 1918 |title=Indian Fresco Uncovered at Old Mission. Freize Hidden in Dolores Sacristy Perhaps for More than a Century, Brought to Light |newspaper=San Francisco Examiner |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same article, "The old sacristy walls were preserved with a sheathing of wood by Father Prendergast away back in 1862."&lt;ref name="sfe1918"/&gt; By 1918 the mural had already been covered for over 120 years.

On April 10, 1936, [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] (HABS) documentation was undertaken by photographer [[Robert Kerrigan]], who recorded black and white photographs of the central niche.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/ca0674.photos.016019p/ |title=Detail of Original Altar Niche |last=Kerrigan |first=Robert W. |date=April 10, 1936 |website=Historic American Buildings Survey |publisher=Library of Congress |location=Washington, D.C. |access-date=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From those photographs the central niche appears to be unchanged in condition since that time. The mission church, the mural, and the hatch opening to it are documented in architectural drawings. Detailed drawings of the sanctuary interior show painted ornament on the north and south walls, of which one design clearly resembles the images of hearts found behind the reredos. This design painted in red on natural white plaster is obviously a [[rooster]], with intricately painted feathers and a heart in the center. The rooster is a Christian symbol of the resurrection of Jesus.

During the late 1980s, [[Norman Neuerburg]], a noted mission historian, crawled behind the altar in the cramped space to draw a sketch of the mural.

In the 2000s, archaeologist [[Eric Blind]] and artist [[Ben Wood]] of the Mission Dolores Digital Mural Project captured the first photographs of the mural, keeping the 1796 reredos intact. Digital images were displayed to the public in a projection display onto the interior dome of the Mission Dolores basilica. The Office of Historic Preservation of the [[California Department of Parks and Recreation]] awarded Blind and Wood the California Governor's Historic Preservation Award for their work preserving the mural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Rosato |first=Joe |date=2004-11-17 |url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/712/files/111704.pdf |title=State Parks Announces 2004 Governor's Awards |publisher=[[California Department of Parks and Recreation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2007, Blind presented the professional paper, "Visualizing Past Places: The Mission Dolores Mural", at the California Mission Studies Association annual meeting.

It is thought that separating the back altar from the mural would be a very complicated and costly process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Raygoza |first=Octavio |authorlink=Mission Loc@l |year=2010 |url = http://missionlocal.org/2010/10/forgotten-18th-century-mural/|title=Forgotten 18th Century Mural Dolores}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2596">The '''National Campaign for the Arts''' ('''NCA''') is a [[United Kingdom]] lobbying group campaigning for all the arts. Their [http://forthearts.org.uk website] states "We campaign for more public investment in the arts because we believe that the arts are for everyone and make everyone’s lives better."

The current Chair is the actor and director [[Samuel West]]. Other Board members include the visual artist [[Bob and Roberta Smith]], the writer and broadcaster [[A. L. Kennedy]] and Artistic Director of the [[Holland Festival]], [[Ruth Mackenzie]] CBE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forthearts.org.uk/who-we-are/our-board/ title=NCA Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaigns ==
The NCA publish the ''[http://forthearts.org.uk/publications/arts-index-england-2007-2014/ Arts Index]'', a bi-annual "health check for the arts". ''50p for Culture'' is a campaign which ranks Local Authorities by the amount of their investment in culture and encourages constituents to write to them in support or encouragement. ''Hearts for the Arts'' is an annual award that recognises excellence in Local Authority support for the arts.

== History ==
The NCA came into being in 1985 through the merger of the National Lobby for the Arts (NLA) and British Arts Voice (BRAVO). It was established as a membership organization, receiving no government funding.

The NCA was initially funded by six organizations which represent professional artists: the [[Association of British Orchestras]]; [[British Actors' Equity Association]]; the [[Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union]] (BECTU); the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]]; the [[The Society of London Theatre|Society of West End Theatres]] and the [[Theatrical Management Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://forthearts.org.uk/who-we-are/our-history/ title=NCA History]&lt;/ref&gt;

NCA is a charity and a company limited by guarantee, established to campaign with and on behalf of the public and the arts sector for more public funding and investment.

'''National School of Drama''' (or '''NSD''') is a theatre training institute situated at [[New Delhi]], [[India]]. It is an autonomous organization under [[Ministry of Culture (India)|Ministry of Culture]], [[Government of India]]. It was set up in 1959 by the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], and became an independent school in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qYfH1tOwsHcC&amp;pg=PA676&amp;dq=%22national+school+of+drama%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0 Training - National School of Drama]''The Columbia encyclopedia of modern drama'', by Gabrielle H. Cody, Evert Sprinchorn. Columbia University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|0-231-14422-9}}. ''Page 766''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 it was granted [[deemed university]] status, but in 2011 it was revoked on the institute's request.

==''History''==
The origins of the school can be traced back to a seminar in 1954, where the idea of a Central institution for theatre was mooted, subsequently, a draft scheme was prepared in 1955, and the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], which had [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] as its president, started drawing plans for the institution. Meanwhile, elsewhere in Delhi, Bharatiya Natya Sangh (BNS) with assistance from [[UNESCO]], independently established the 'Asian Theatre Institute' (ATI) on 20 January 1958, and in July 1958, ATI was taken over by the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]] (SNA), India’s National Academy of Music, dance and drama of [[Government of India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090315/spectrum/main1.htm National School of Drama ..over the past 50 years] [[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] 15 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ns/&gt;

In the following year, the government merged it with the newly founded school, and thus NSD was established in April 1959 under the auspices of [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]]. Initially, the school was situated at [[Nizamuddin West]] and was called 'National School of Drama and Asian Theatre Institute, whose first batch passed out in 1961. During his tenure as the director of the institution, [[Ebrahim Alkazi]] (1962–1977), not just overhauled the syllabus, but also had the students dig and build platforms for a theatre in the backyard of a rented [[Kailash Colony]] house, where NSD had moved.&lt;ref name=hin&gt;{{cite news |title=Theatre is revelation (Interview) |url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2008/02/24/stories/2008022450160500.htm |publisher=''[[The Hindu]]'' |date=24 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later when it moved to its present location, he also designed two theatres for NSD, including a 200-seat studio theatre, and the open-air Meghdoot theatre, under a banyan tree.&lt;ref name=ns/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=COkXM9n7KUcC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=%22National+School+of+Drama%22#PPA168,M1 National School of Drama] ''The World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: Asia/Pacific'', by Don Rubin. Published by Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001. {{ISBN|0-415-26087-6}}. Page 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 it became an [[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] organization, under the erstwhile Ministry of Education and Ministry of Culture, Department of Culture, with the name 'National School of Drama' and relocated in May 1975, to its present premises at [[Bahawalpur House]], the residence of [[Bahawalpur (princely state)|Bahawalpur]] a former [[princely state]]. However, the place is generally known by adjacent (now demolished) [[Mandi House]], the former residence of Raja of erstwhile [[Mandi State|Mandi princely state]].&lt;ref name=ns/&gt; In 1999, the School organized its first National Theatre Festival, 'Bharat Rang Mahotsav', generally held during the second week of January each year.

In 2008, the institution celebrated its golden jubilee at its annual theatre festival, ''[[Bharat Rang Mahotsav]]'', with a gathering of its alumni from all over the country,&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Features/Culture_Cauldron/National_School_of_Drama_celebrates_golden_jubilee_in_style/rssarticleshow/2694072.cms National School of Drama celebrates golden jubilee in style] [[The Economic Times]], 12 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the festival’s satellite edition in Mumbai showcased plays of NSD graduates, including Ratan Thiyam’s Prologue, Bansi Kaul (Aranyadhipati Tantiya), Neelam Mansingh Chowdhury (The Suit), Sanjay Upadhyay (Harsingar), [[Baharul Islam (actor)|Baharul Islam]] (Akash), Mohan Maharishi (Dear Bapu) and [[M K Raina]] (Stay Yet Awhile).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/the-graduates/255144/|title=The Graduates|date=28 December 2007|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=2 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004221012/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/the-graduates/255144/|archivedate=4 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waman Kendre was appointed as Director the school in 2013.

===Deemed university status===
On 16 March 2005, the Government of India granted the NSD the status of [[deemed university]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page1.asp?relid=7814 National School of Drama gets Deemed University Status][[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Ministry of Human Resource Development]] 16 March 2005."The Government has declared the National School of Drama, New Delhi as Deemed to be University with immediate effect."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/mar162005/update11.asp ''NSD declared deemed university''] [[Deccan Herald]] 16 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2010 the NSD Society asked for the deemed university status to be revoked since "[it] could undermine the professional training, autonomy, and flexibility required in the creative fields such as theatre." Thus, in October 2011 the status was revoked on request of NSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2518525.ece |title=The Hindu : News / National : NSD loses deemed varsity status on own request  |work=thehindu.com |accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Norman conquest of Sicily==
[[File:Christ Pantokrator, Cathedral of Cefalù, Sicily.jpg|thumb|Byzantine-style mosaic of [[Christ Pantokrator]] in the [[Cefalù Cathedral]], erected by Roger II in 1131]]
In 965 [[Muslim]]s completed their [[History of Islam in southern Italy | conquest of Sicily]] from the [[Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire]]  following the fall of the final significant Greek citadel of [[Taormina]] in 962.{{cn|date=July 2017}} Seventy three years later, in 1038, Byzantine forces began a reconquest of Sicily under the Greek general [[George Maniakes]]. This invasion relied on a number of [[Norsemen|Norse]] mercenaries, the [[Varangian Guard|Varangian]]s, including the future king of Norway [[Harald Hardrada]], as well as on several contingents of [[italo-Normans|Normans]]. Although Maniakes' death in a Byzantine civil war in 1043 cut the invasion short, the Normans followed up on the advances made by the Byzantines and completed the conquest of the island from the [[Saracens]]. The Normans had been expanding south, as mercenaries and adventurers, driven by the myth of a happy and sunny island in the Southern Seas.&lt;ref&gt;''Les Normands en Sicile'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The Norman [[Robert Guiscard]], son of [[Tancred of Hauteville|Tancred]], [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|invaded Sicily]] in 1060. The island was split politically between three [[Arabs|Arab]] [[emirate|emir]]s, and the sizable [[Eastern Orthodox|Byzantine Christian]] population rebelled against the ruling Muslims. One year later [[Messina]] fell to troops under the leadership of Roger Bosso (the brother of Robert Guiscard and the future Count [[Roger I of Sicily]]), and in 1071 the Normans took [[Palermo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bestofsicily.com/mag/art139.htm |title= Saracen Door and Battle of Palermo |publisher= Bestofsicily.com |date= 2004 |accessdate= 28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the cities, each with a splendid harbor, dealt a severe blow to Muslim power on the island. Eventually Normans took all of Sicily. In 1091, [[Noto]] in the southern tip of Sicily and the island of [[Malta]], the last Arab strongholds, fell to the Christians.

By the 11th century Muslim power in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] had begun to wane.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Charles William Previté-Orton|Previté-Orton]] (1971), pp. 507-511.

Under Norman rule, Palermo confirmed its role as one of the great capitals of Europe and the Mediterranean.

The main primary sources for the kingdom are Arabic (Muslim);&lt;ref&gt;All the Arabic sources can be found in Michele Amari, ''Biblioteca arabo-sicula'' (Rome and Turin: 1880).&lt;/ref&gt; the Latin (Christian) sources are scanter. According to Hubert Houben, since "Africa" was never mentioned in the royal title of the kings of Sicily, "one ought not to speak of a ‘Norman kingdom of Africa’."&lt;ref&gt;Houben, ''Roger II'', 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, "[Norman Africa] really amounted to a constellation of Norman-held towns along coastal Ifrīqiya."&lt;ref name=dalli79&gt;Dalli, "Bridging Europe and Africa", 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sicilian conquest of Africa began under [[Roger II]] in 1146–48. Sicilian rule consisted of military garrisons in the major towns, exactions on the local Muslim population, protection of Christians and the minting of coin. The local aristocracy was largely left in place, and Muslim princes controlled the civil government under Sicilian oversight. Economic connections between Sicily and Africa, which were strong before the conquest, were strengthened, while ties between Africa and northern Italy were expanded.  Early in the reign of [[William I of Sicily|William I]], the "kingdom" of Africa fell to the [[Almohads]] (1158–60). Its most enduring legacy was the realignment of Mediterranean powers brought about by its demise and the Siculo-Almohad peace finalised in 1180.

An intense Norman-Arab-[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] culture developed, exemplified by rulers such as [[Roger II of Sicily]], who had [[Islam]]ic soldiers, poets and scientists at his court,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, p.147&lt;/ref&gt; and had [[Byzantine Greeks]], [[Christodulus|Christodoulos]], the famous [[George of Antioch]], and finally [[Philip of Mahdia]], serve successively as his ''ammiratus ammiratorum'' ("emir of emirs").&lt;ref&gt;Abulafia, David (2011) ''The Great Sea: A Human History of the Mediterranean''. (London: Allen Lane). {{ISBN|978-0-7139-9934-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger II himself spoke [[Classical Arabic|Arabic]] and was fond of [[Arab culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Aubé, p.177&lt;/ref&gt; He used Arab and Byzantine Greek troops and siege engines in his campaigns in southern Italy, and mobilized Arab and Byzantine architects to help his Normans build monuments in the Norman-Arab-Byzantine style. The various agricultural and industrial techniques which had been introduced by the Arabs in Sicily during the preceding two centuries were kept and further developed, allowing for the remarkable prosperity of the Island.&lt;ref&gt;Aubé, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous [[Transmission of the Greek Classics|Classical Greek works]], long lost to the Latin speaking West, were translated from Byzantine Greek manuscripts found in Sicily directly into Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David C. (ed.).  ''Science in the Middle Ages''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978. p. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt; For the following two hundred years, Sicily under Norman rule became a model which was widely admired throughout Europe and Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;Aubé, p.171&lt;/ref&gt;

The English historian John Julius Norwich remarked of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Norman Sicily stood forth in Europe --and indeed in the whole bigoted medieval world-- as an example of tolerance and enlightenment, a lesson in the respect that every man should feel for those whose blood and beliefs happen to differ from his own."&lt;br /&gt;[[John Julius Norwich]]&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in History Edition of Best of Sicily Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During Roger II's reign, the Kingdom of Sicily became increasingly characterized by its multi-ethnic composition and unusual religious tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestofsicily.com/mag/art171.htm |title=Normans in Sicilian History |publisher=Bestofsicily.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic Normans, Langobards and native Sicilians, Muslim Arabs, and Orthodox Byzantine Greeks existed in a relative harmony for this time period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9377080/Roger-II |title=Roger II&amp;nbsp;— Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Concise.britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523045823/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9377080/Roger-II |archivedate=2007-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D61331F935A15757C0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 |title=Tracing The Norman Rulers of Sicily |publisher=New York Times |date=1987-04-26 |accessdate=2010-01-21 | first=Louis | last=Inturrisi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Roger II was known to have planned for the establishment of an Empire that would have encompassed [[Fatimid]] [[Egypt]] and the [[Crusader states]] in the [[Levant]] up until his death in 1154.&lt;ref&gt;''Les Normands en Sicile'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the greatest geographical treatises of the Middle Ages was written for Roger II by the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] scholar [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]], and entitled [[Tabula Rogeriana|Kitab Rudjdjar]] ("The book of Roger").&lt;ref name="Lewis, p.148"&gt;Lewis, p.148&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 12th century, the population of Sicily is estimated to have been up to one-third [[Byzantine Greek]] speaking, with the remainder speaking [[Latin]] or [[Vulgar Latin]] dialects brought from mainland Italy ([[Gallo-Italic languages]] and [[Neapolitan language]]), [[Norman language|Norman]] and [[Sicilian Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Loud, G. A. |title=The Latin Church in Norman Italy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |page=494 |isbn=978-0-521-25551-6 |quote={{ISBN|0-521-25551-1}}" "At the end of the twelfth century&amp;nbsp;... While in Apulia Greeks were in a majority – and indeed present in any numbers at all – only in the Salento peninsula in the extreme south, at the time of the conquest they had an overwhelming preponderance in Lucaina and central and southern Calabria, as well as comprising anything up to a third of the population of Sicily, concentrated especially in the north-east of the island, the Val Demone. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the language of the court was [[Old Norman]] or [[Old French]] ([[Langues d'oïl|Langue d'oïl]]), all royal edicts were written in the language of the people they were addressed to: [[Latin]], Byzantine Greek, Arabic, or [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].&lt;ref&gt;Aube, p.162&lt;/ref&gt; Roger's royal mantel, used for his coronation (and also used for the coronation of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]), bore an inscription in Arabic with the [[Hijri year|Hijri]] date of 528 (1133–1134).

Islamic authors marvelled at the forbearance of the Norman kings:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"They [the Muslims] were treated kindly, and they were protected, even against the [[Franks]]. Because of that, they had great love for king Roger."&lt;br /&gt;[[Ibn al-Athir]]&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Aubé, p.168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Interactions continued with the succeeding Norman kings, for example under [[William II of Sicily]], as attested by the Spanish-Arab geographer [[Ibn Jubair]] who landed in the island after returning from a [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]] in 1184. To his surprise, Ibn Jubair enjoyed a very warm reception by the Norman Christians. He was further surprised to find that even some Christians spoke Arabic and that several government officials were Muslim:&lt;ref name="Lewis, p.148"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The attitude of the king is really extraordinary. His attitude towards the Muslims is perfect: he gives them employment, he choses his officers among them, and all, or almost all, keep their faith secret and can remain faithful to the faith of Islam. The king has full confidence in the Muslims and relies on them to handle many of his affairs, including the most important ones, to the point that the Great Intendant for cooking is a Muslim (...) His [[vizier]]s and [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]]s are [[eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]], of which there are many, who are the members of his government and on whom he relies for his private affairs."&lt;br /&gt;Ibn Jubair, ''Rihla''.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lewis, p. 148, also Aube, p.168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ibn Jubair mentioned that some Christians in Palermo wore the Muslim dress and spoke Arabic. The Norman kings continued to strike coins in Arabic with [[Hegira]] dates. The registers at the Royal court were written in Arabic.&lt;ref name="Lewis, p.148"/&gt; At one point, William II of Sicily is recorded to have said: "Every one of you should invoke the one he adores and of whom he follows the faith".&lt;ref&gt;Aubé, p.170&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norman-Arab-Byzantine art===
{{Further|Byzantine art}}
[[File:Arabo-NormanArchitecture.JPG|thumb|Arab-Norman art and architecture combined Occidental features (such as the Classical pillars and friezes) with typical Islamic decorations such as [[muqarnas]] and [[Arabic calligraphy|calligraphy]]&lt;ref&gt;''Les Normands en Sicile''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Numerous artistic techniques from the Byzantine and Islamic world were also incorporated to form the basis of Arab-Norman art: inlays in mosaics or metals, sculpture of [[ivory]] or [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], sculpture of hard stones, bronze foundries, manufacture of silk (for which Roger II established a ''regium ergasterium'', a state enterprise which would give Sicily the monopoly of silk manufacture for all Western Europe).&lt;ref&gt;Aubé, pp. 164-165&lt;/ref&gt; During a raid on the Byzantine Empire, Roger II's admiral George of Antioch had transported the silk weavers from [[Thebes, Greece]], where they had formed a part of the, until then, closely guarded monopoly that was the [[Byzantine silk industry]].

===Norman-Arab-Byzantine architecture===
{{Further|Byzantine architecture}}
{{Further|Norman architecture}}
[[File:Monreale-bjs-3.jpg|thumb|left|The outsides of the principal doorways and their pointed arches of the [[Monreale]] cathedral are magnificently enriched with carving and colored [[inlay]], a curious combination of three styles—Norman-French, Byzantine and Arab]]

The new Norman rulers started to build various constructions in what is called the Arab-Norman style. They incorporated the best practices of Arab and Byzantine architecture into their own art.&lt;ref&gt;"Le genie architectural des Normands a su s’adapter aux lieux en prenant ce qu’il y a de meilleur dans le savoir-faire des batisseurs arabes et byzantins", ''Les Normands en Sicile'', p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of [[Saint-John of the Hermits]], was built in Palermo by Roger II around 1143–1148 in such a style. The church is notable for its brilliant red domes, which show clearly the persistence of Arab influences in Sicily at the time of its reconstruction in the 12th century. In her ''Diary of an Idle Woman in Sicily'', [[Frances Minto Elliot|Frances Elliot]] described it as "... totally oriental... it would fit well in [[Baghdad]] or [[Damascus]]". The bell tower, with four orders of arcaded loggias, is instead a typical example of [[Gothic architecture]].

[[File:Chapelle Palatine.jpg|thumb|"The [[Cappella Palatina]], at Palermo, the most wonderful of Roger's churches, with Norman doors, Saracenic arches, Byzantine dome, and roof adorned with Arabic scripts, is perhaps the most striking product of the brilliant and mixed civilization over which the grandson of the Norman Trancred ruled" ([[EB1911]])]]

The [[Cappella Palatina]], also in Palermo, combines harmoniously a variety of styles: the [[Norman architecture]] and door decor, the Arabic arches and scripts adorning the roof, the Byzantine dome and mosaics. For instance, clusters of four eight-pointed stars, typical for Muslim design, are arranged on the ceiling so as to form a Christian [[cross]].

The [[Monreale]] cathedral is generally described as "Norman-Arab-Byzantine". The outsides of the principal doorways and their pointed arches are magnificently enriched with carving and colored inlay, a curious combination of three styles—Norman-French, Byzantine and Arab.

The [[Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio]] built in 1143 by Roger II's "emir of emirs" [[George of Antioch]] was originally consecrated as a [[Greek Orthodox]] church, according to its Greek-Arab bilingual foundation charter, and was built in the Byzantine [[Cross-in-square|Greek cross]] style with some Arab influences. Another unusual church from this period is the country church of [[Santi Pietro e Paolo d’Agrò]] in [[Casalvecchio Siculo]]; it has been described "one of the most sophisticated and coherent works of architecture to emerge from the Norman rule of the island".&lt;ref name=agro&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/22630|title=The architecture of the church of SS. Pietro e Paolo d'Agro, Sicily |last=Nicklies|first=Charles Edward|date=1992|website=Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship|publisher=University of Illinois|access-date=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of Arab-Norman architecture include the [[Palazzo dei Normanni]], or [[Castelbuono]]. This style of construction persisted until the 14th and the 15th century, exemplified by the use of the [[cupola]].&lt;ref&gt;''Les Normands en Sicile'', pp. 53–57&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transmission to Europe==
{{main|Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe}}

The points of contact between Europe and Islamic lands were multiple during the Middle Ages, with Sicily playing a key role in the transmission of knowledge to Europe, although less important than that of Spain.&lt;ref name="Lewis, p.149"&gt;Lewis, p.149&lt;/ref&gt; The main points of transmission of Islamic knowledge to Europe were in Sicily, and in Islamic Spain, particularly in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] (with [[Gerard of Cremone]], 1114–1187, following the conquest of the city by the Spanish Christians in 1085). Many exchanges also occurred in the Levant due to the presence of the [[Crusaders]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Lebedel, p.110-111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Saint-John of the Hermits(1840Lithograph).JPG|thumb|An example of Arab-Norman architecture, combining Gothic walls with Islamic domes: [[Saint-John of the Hermits]] built in Palermo by Roger II around 1143–1148. 1840 lithography&lt;ref&gt;''Les Normands en Sicile'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Arabic and Greek art and science continued to be influential in Sicily during the two centuries following the Norman conquest. Norman rule formally ended in 1198 with the reign of [[Constance of Sicily]], and was replaced by that of the [[Swabia]]n [[Hohenstaufen Dynasty]].

In 1224 however, Frederick II, responding to religious uprisings in Sicily, expelled all Muslims from the island, transferring many to [[Lucera]] over the next two decades. In this controlled environment, they couldn't challenge royal authority and they benefited the crown in taxes and military service. Their numbers eventually reached between 15,000 and 20,000, leading Lucera to be called ''Lucaera Saracenorum'' because it represented the last stronghold of Islamic presence in Italy. The colony thrived for 75 years until it was sacked in 1300 by Christian forces under the command of [[Charles II of Naples]]. The city's Muslim inhabitants were exiled or sold into slavery,&lt;ref&gt;Julie Taylor. [http://www.umd.umich.edu/univ/ur/press_releases/nov03/taylorbook_pr.html Muslims in Medieval Italy: The Colony at Lucera] {{webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100819071240/http://www.umd.umich.edu/univ/ur/press_releases/nov03/taylorbook_pr.html |date=2010-08-19 }}. Lanham, Md.: Lexington Books. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; with many finding asylum in [[Albania]] across the [[Adriatic Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Ataullah Bogdan Kopanski. [http://www.iiu.edu.my/deed/quran/albanian/Albchapt.htm Islamization of Shqeptaret: The clash of Religions in Medieval Albania.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125004644/http://www.iiu.edu.my/deed/quran/albanian/Albchapt.htm |date=2009-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their abandoned mosques were destroyed or converted, and churches arose upon the ruins, including the cathedral S. Maria della Vittoria.

Even under [[Manfred of Sicily|Manfred]] (died in 1266) Islamic influence in Sicily persisted, but it had almost disappeared by the beginning of the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Lewis, p.149"/&gt; Latin progressively replaced Arabic and Greek, the last Sicilian document in the Arabic language is dated to 1245.&lt;ref name="Lewis, p.148"/&gt;

'''Open-source record labels''' are [[record label]]s that release music under [[copyleft]] [[software license|licenses]], that is, licenses that allow free redistribution and may allow free modification of the tracks.

They hold that the fight over free, [[gratis versus Libre|libre]], and [[open content]] and media is a struggle over the [[Freedom of speech|freedoms of expression and speech]], with the goal of opening up the possibilities of media through open collaboration. This is a reaction against what some musicians see as corporate control of music via means of [[copyright]]. They believe that creativity requires that musicians reappropriate and reinterpret music and sounds to enable them to create truly innovative music. Additionally, [[copyleft]] enables musicians to develop music collaboratively and equitably.

==Plot==
[[Poltava]] resident Lyudmila Dobryjvecher tries become an announcer on television but does not pass the audition because of her terrible diction. She dreams of becoming a flight attendant on the Tu-104 — but this also does not come to pass. Now Lyudmila is once again preparing to enter the ensemble "Ballet on Ice". She compensates the lack of ice with training on [[roller skates]] and temporarily finds work as a tanker at a gas station. Not everything works out for the new-born worker, but cheerful disposition and resourcefulness help her not only to master a new specialty, but also radically rebuild the industry of the entire gas station.

'''SMOG''' ({{lang-ru|СМОГ}}) was one of the earliest informal literary groups independent of the [[Soviet state]] in the post-Stalin [[Soviet Union]]. Among the several interpretations of the acronym are ''Smelsot', Mysl', Obraz i Glubina'' (Courage, Thought, Image and Depth), and, humorously, ''Samoe Molodoe Obshchestvo Geniev'' (Society of Youngest Geniuses).&lt;ref&gt;Or: ''Szhatyj Mig Otrazhennoi Giperboly'' (Condensed Moment of Reflected Hyperbole). 'Smog' is also a past tense of the verb 'to be able to', yielding 'I was able to', or 'I did it'. {{Cite book| publisher = Modern Humanities Research Association| isbn = 978-1-907322-52-5| last = Kravchenko| first = E.

It was organized in January/February 1965 by a group of young poets and writers: Poet Leonid Gubanov (initiator, membership card #1), writer and editor Vladimir Batshev (membership card #2), poet and publicist [[Yuri Kublanovsky]], Vladimir Aleynikov, a poet who received the Andrei Belyi prize; and poets Nikolai Bokov, Arkady Pakhomov, later joined by several dozens of others.&lt;ref&gt;Диссиденты о диссидентстве. «Знамя». — М., 1997, № 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Виктория Андреева , [http://www.port-folio.org/2006/part122.htm SMOG]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Сенкевич А.

The group carried out public reading of poetry and issued several ''[[samizdat]]'' collections and a magazine ''Sfinksy'' ("Sphynxes"). In 1965, they revived the literary meetings at Mayakovsky Square ([[Mayakovsky Square poetry readings]]).&lt;ref name=sundaram-stone&gt;{{Cite journal| issue = 16| last = Sundaram| first = Chantal| title = "The stone skin of the monument": Mayakovsky, Dissent and Popular Culture in the Soviet Union|url=http://sites.utoronto.ca/tsq/16/sundaram16.shtml |journal = Toronto Slavic Quarterly| date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the members also helped organize the unsanctioned [[Glasnost Meeting|1965 glasnost rally]] calling for a legal trial of writers Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel.&lt;ref name="daniel-roginsky"&gt;{{Cite book| editor = A.

The group was under the pressure of the state. The last poetry reading took place on April 14, 1966.

The film revolves around the role of Naidu (Kaikala Satyanarayana), a Carnatic musician and elder son Narayana Murthy (played by Rajasekhar) who starts getting recognized in the world because of the music learned from Naidu and leaves everyone to fall into the worldly pleasures, forgetting his base roots. It is now the duty of Sita, the daughter-in-law of Naidu (wife of Narayana Murthy) to bring these souls on track.

The film starts with Mr. Naidu (Satyanarayana), a great fan of music and traditional Indian fine arts. He wants his only son to become a great musician, but unfortunately he loses his son in a car accident.
 
Then he adopts three orphaned street children and teaches them carnatic music so they can make his dream of building and starting an academy of fine arts come true. Sumalata is also a fan of music and loves Mr. Narayana (the oldest adopted son of Naidu). Naidu agrees for them to get married and Naresh, the second son marries a rich girl.

Naidu sends the three sons to city to earn sufficient money to start the construction of a Music academy. But all three forget the cause they come for once they get popularity in city and they get addicted to bad habits. They disrespect his father once and Rajasekhar even tries to hit his pregnant wife. All this makes Mr. Naidu send the three sons away from home. Then Sumalata, the daughter-in-law takes the onus to make Mr. Naidu's dream come true. She makes her son a great musician and dancer. After a long time, she returns to the city where her husband lives. There she gets Narayana Murthy to take interest in their son's talents without revealing herself to Narayana Murthy or his brother.

Narayana, who doesn't know his son, appreciates his talents well and accepts to teach him music. Sumalata makes the other two sons of Mr. Naidu also to concentrate on music through her son. She teaches them a lesson and they come to the realize what they did wrong.

In the end, all the sons come together and meet their father and ask for his forgiveness. He forgives them and they start afresh to try and establish the Music Academy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1819">'''Structuralist film theory''' is a branch of [[film theory]] that is rooted in [[structuralism]], itself based on [[structural linguistics]]. 

==Overview==
Structuralist film theory emphasizes how [[film]]s convey [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] through the use of [[code (semiotics)|code]]s and conventions not dissimilar to the way languages are used to construct meaning in communication. However, structuralist film theory differs from linguistic theory in that its codifications include a more apparent temporal aspect. In other words, the site of the study (the film) is moving in time and must be analyzed in a framework which can consider its temporality. To that end, structuralist film theory is dependent on a new kind of [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]], first proposed by the [[Prague school|Prague linguistic circle]], dubbed the [[Ostensive definition|ostensive]] sign.&lt;ref&gt;Sternagel, Jörg, Deborah Levitt, Dieter Mersch, and Lesley Stern. ''Acting and Performance in Moving Image Culture: Bodies, Screens, Renderings'', 2012. p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this is understanding how the simple combination of shots can create an additional idea: the blank expression on a person's face, an appetizing meal, and then back to the person's face. While nothing in this sequence literally expresses hunger—or desire—the juxtaposition of the images convey that meaning to the audience. Unraveling this additional meaning can become quite complex. Lighting, angle, shot duration, juxtaposition, cultural context, and a wide array of other elements can actively reinforce or undermine a sequence's meaning. This is known as the [[Kuleshov effect]].

'''''The Art Gallery of Jan Gildemeester Jansz''''' is a painting created by the Dutch painter [[Adriaan de Lelie]] in 1794-95. It is part of the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum|Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]], 63.7&amp;nbsp;cm wide and 85.7&amp;nbsp;cm high, executed in oil paint on panel. It depicts the art collector [[Jan Gildemeester|Jan Gildemeester Jansz]] (or Jan Jansz. Gildemeester) in the midst of his large [[Collection (artwork)|collection]] of paintings, showing them to friends.

The painting was acquired by the Rijksmuseum in 1964&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Bruyn Kops|first=C. J.|date=1965-01-01|title=De Amsterdamse verzamelaar Jan Gildemeester Jansz|jstor=40381555|journal=Bulletin van het Rijksmuseum|volume=13|issue=3|pages=79–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being part of a French private collection.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/5389|title=Explore Adriaan de Lelie|website=rkd.nl|access-date=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art historical context and inspiration ==

[[File:David Teniers the Younger - Archduke Leopold William in his Gallery at Brussels - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|Example of a Flemish 17th-Century 'konstkamer'. [[David Teniers the Younger]]: ''Archduke Leopold William in his Gallery at Brussels'', ca. 1650, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Wien.]]

=== Konstkamers ===
According to the art historian C.J. De Bruyn Knops, the subject of the work - an [[Private collection|art collector]] at home, showing his art collection to his friends - is unique in [[Netherlands|Northern-Netherlandish]] painting before 1800. In Flemish ([[Southern Netherlands|Southern-Netherlandish]]) painting, this genre was common in the 17th Century; it was executed by masters like [[Willem van Haecht]], [[David Teniers the Younger|David Teniers]], [[Gillis van Tilborch|Gillis van Tilborgh]] and [[Gonzales Coques|Gonzales Cocques]], but in the Northern Netherlands the subject didn't become popular. Probably Adriaan de Lelie had seen such works while studying in [[Antwerp]]. However, the Flemish 'konstkamers' ('art rooms') looked very different: they used to depict imaginary architecture, and probably not reality as seen by the painter. The Art Gallery of Jan Gildemeester Jansz, on the contrary, is a very accurate depiction of a real space.

[[File:Zoffany Royal Collection.jpg|thumb|[[Johan Zoffany]]: ''The Academicians of the Royal Academy'', 1772, Royal Collection of the United Kingdom. Jan Jansz. Gildemeester owned an engraving after this painting, which might have inspired the spontaneous figures in the work by Adriaan de Lelie.]]

=== Household scenes ===
Adriaan de Lelie follows the tradition of intimate [[household]] scenes that were painted very commonly in the Northern Netherlands since the 17th Century. Usually, the people in such genre works are clearly striking a pose, while the visitors in The Art Gallery of Jan Gildemeester Jansz look very natural, as if they are unaware of the presence of the painter. Probably, De Lelie was inspired by English contemporaries here: Jan Jansz. Gildemeester possessed a 1773 engraving of a spontaneous group painting by [[Johan Zoffany]], which must have been familiar to De Lelie.

== Depicted space, people and artworks ==
[[File:Overzicht zandstenen voorgevel gezien vanaf overzijde - Amsterdam - 20408958 - RCE.jpg|left|thumb|Herengracht 475 in 2005.]]
The two rooms depicted in this painting still exist: the large room in front and the smaller one with windows in the back are part of the house that was owned by Jan Jansz. Gildemeester since 1792, currently a [[Rijksmonument]] located on Herengracht 475 in Amsterdam. The ceiling painting in the first room (by [[Jacob de Wit]], 1731) the relief above the door and other decorations have been restored during a 20th-Century renovation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Jan Jansz. Gildemeester stands in the middle of the work. Adriaan de Lelie has probably portrayed himself kneeling on the right. Other people depicted in the work are possibly the Amsterdam-based art trader Pierre Fouquet Jr., Dutch physicist baron [[Cornelis Rudolphus Theodorus Krayenhoff|Cornelius Rudolphus Theodorus Krayenhoff]] (wearing a [[tricorne]] hat), painter [[Jurriaan Andriessen (artist)|Jurriaan Andriessen]], tradesman Anthony Dull and his wife Marianne Dull-Dohrmann (sitting behind the easel on the left), and art collector and writer Bernardus de Bosch Jeronimosz.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; - according to C.J. De Bruyn Knops, the RKD and the Rijksmuseum's website, but this opinion is questioned by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Eeghen|first=I.H.|date=February 1972|title=De restauratie van Herengracht 475|url=http://archief.amstelodamum.nl/resources/1972_mb_59.pdf|journal=Amstelodamum|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-04-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917052253/http://archief.amstelodamum.nl/resources/1972_mb_59.pdf|archivedate=2016-09-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As usual in that era, the paintings are arranged in rows, close to each other on the walls. It is highly likely that the visible artworks were chosen by the collector and painter together, specifically for this painting, and that they were considered the highlights from Gildemeesters collection.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many works in the first room can be identified with certainty. The art collection of Jan Jansz. Gildemeester was [[auction]]ed after his death in 1800, and the [[auction catalog]]ue&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/catalvan00schl|title=Catalogus van het kabinet van schilderyen, nagelaaten door den kunstminnaar Jan Gildemeester Jansz|last=Schley|first=Philippe van der|last2=Jean de Bosch|last3=Jean Yver|last4=R. Meurs Pruyssenaar|date=1800-01-01|publisher=Amsterdam : Philippe van der Schley}}&lt;/ref&gt; documents the works in quite a bit of detail. Gildemeester's taste as an art collector corresponds with that of his contemporaries: he mainly owned [[Genre painting|genre pieces]], [[Marine art|marine paintings]], [[Landscape painting|landscapes]], [[Animal painter|animal]] and [[Still life|still-life]] paintings. His earliest purchases probably were [[drawing]]s and [[Printmaking|prints]], of which he also built a considerable collection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''The Aryan''''' (1916) is an American [[silent film|silent era]] [[western (genre)|western]] [[film|motion picture]] starring [[William S. Hart]], [[Gertrude Claire]], [[Charles K. French]], [[Louise Glaum]], and [[Bessie Love]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/A/Aryan1916.html ''The Aryan'' at silentera.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[film director|Directed]] by [[William S. Hart]] and [[film producer|produced]] by [[Thomas H. Ince]], the [[screenplay]] was written by [[C. Gardner Sullivan]].

Although Hart was assisted by [[Reginald Barker]] and Clifford Smith, he mostly directed the movie by himself. Hart's salary as both actor and director was $150 per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Hal|last=Erickson|website=AllMovie Guide|title=''The Aryan'' (1916)|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-aryan-v84007|accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prints of the film survive in the [[Library of Congress]] and at the [[Museo del Cine]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/05/movies/05metropolis.html|title=Footage Restored to Fritz Lang's ''Metropolis''|last=Rohter|first=Larry|date=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Hart-william-the-aryan-1916.jpg|thumb|left|Scene from the film.]]
A hard working miner, Steve Denton (played by Hart), has become rich from years of [[prospecting]]. He takes his fortune and leaves to visit his ill mother, Mrs. Denton (played by Claire). 

In the town of Yellow Ridge, however, he is detained by a seductive dance hall girl named Trixie (played by Glaum). Also known as "the firefly," Trixie not only cheats him out of his gold, but also conceals a message that was [[telegraphy|wired]] to him by his dying mother.

Learning the next day that his mother is dead, Denton is infuriated about being cheated and betrayed by Trixie, who pretended to be good, and other false friends. In his rage, he kills Trixie's lover, Chip Emmett (played by Mayall), and kidnaps her. Dragging her by the hair of her head, he takes her into the desert. Enslaving Trixie in his desert hideaway, Denton turns his back on "[[White people|white]] civilization." He hates all white men and women and assumes the leadership of a band of [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] and [[Mexican people|Mexican]] bandits.

Two years later, a wagon-train of [[Mississippi]] farmers who are lost and dying in the desert appeal to Denton for help. He refuses to assist them. He is secretly visited that night by Mary Jane Garth (played by Love), an innocent and virtuous young woman among the migrants who bravely confronts the Indians and Mexicans.

She pleads their cause and expresses her belief that no white man would refuse to protect a woman in distress. Deeply moved, Denton is redeemed. He guides the wagon-train out of the desert and then resumes his wanderings.

==Cast==
*[[William S. Hart]] as Steve Denton
*[[Gertrude Claire]] as Mrs. Denton
*[[Charles K. French]] as "Ivory" Wells
*[[Bessie Love]] as Mary Jane Garth
*[[Louise Glaum]] as Trixie, "the firefly"
*[[Herschel Mayall]] as Chip Emmett
*[[Ernest Swallow]] as Mexican Pete
*[[Enid Bennett]] in an undetermined role
*[[Jean Hersholt]]
*[[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]] as an extra (uncredited)

==Production==
Hart was given a [[screenplay]] by the [[screenwriter]] [[C. Gardner Sullivan]] in which the hero had, according to Hart, "no motive for his hardness." He argued that the audience needed an explanation. Sullivan preferred the idea that his ruthless personality was simply a given, but eventually accepted Hart's wishes. 

Hart wanted [[Mae Marsh]] for the role as Mary Jane, but Marsh was working on a [[D. W. Griffith]] movie at the time. Griffith recommended a new actress, [[Bessie Love]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William|last=Hart|title=My Life – East and West|year=1929|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie was made at the height of Hart's career, but was unusual because he played a ruthless individual described as "hard as flint." As the title suggests, the movie draws on racial ideologies of the era. Hart stated that the central character, Steve Denton, was "a white man, who, foreswearing his race, makes outlaw Mexicans his comrades and allows white women to be attacked by them."&lt;ref name="ron"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ronald L.|last=Davis|title=William S. Hart: Projecting the American West|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2003|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart believed this movie to be "one of the best westerns ever made."&lt;ref name = "ron"/&gt;

'''''The Cathedral''''' ({{lang-pl|Katedra}}) is a 2002 animated [[science fiction]] [[short film]] directed by [[Tomasz Bagiński]]. It is based on the [[short story]] of the same name by [[Jacek Dukaj]], winner of the [[Janusz A. Zajdel Award]] in 2000. The film was nominated in [[2002 in film|2002]] for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] for the [[75th Academy Awards]]. The film also won the title of Best Animated Short at [[Siggraph]] 2002 in [[San Antonio]].

==Plot==
The film focuses on a man who visits a mystical, organic building that looks like a medieval cathedral. As he walks through the immense structure, the light from his torch falls upon the pillars, revealing human faces. The viewer later realizes that the faces are still alive, as several smile and open their eyes as the man walks past them.  The building's nature is partially unveiled at sunrise as the blinding light enchants the visitor and causes organic branch-like structures to burst from his chest. These protrusions then become another set of pillars in the building.

==Reception==
The film was nominated in 2002 for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] for the [[75th Academy Awards]]. The movie won the title of Best Animated Short at [[Siggraph]] 2002 in [[San Antonio]] as well as several other awards.

In May 2011, Polish Prime Minister [[Donald Tusk]] gave several gifts to American President [[Barack Obama]] for his tour in Europe, as is the custom. One of those gifts was an [[iPad]] loaded with ''The Cathedral''.&lt;ref&gt;John Funk ,''[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/110469-Polish-Prime-Minister-Gives-Obama-Witcher-2 Polish Prime Minister Gives Obama Witcher 2]'', 28 May 2011, The Escapist&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife'''''|蛸と海女|Tako to ama|''[[Octopus]](es) and [[ama diver|shell diver]]''}}, also known as '''''Girl Diver and Octopuses''''', '''''Diver and Two Octopuses''''', etc., is a [[Woodblock printing|woodblock-printed]] design by the [[Japan]]ese artist [[Hokusai]]. It is included in ''Kinoe no Komatsu'' ({{lang-en|Young Pines}}), a three-volume book of [[Shunga (art)|shunga]] erotica first published in 1814, and has become Hokusai's most famous shunga design. Playing with themes popular in Japanese art, it depicts a young [[ama diver]] entwined sexually with a pair of [[octopus]]es.

==History and description==
''The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife'' is the most famous image in ''Kinoe no Komatsu'', published in three volumes from 1814. The book is a work of [[Shunga (art)|shunga]] ([[erotic art]]) within the [[ukiyo-e]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;Uhlenbeck, p. 56; 161.&lt;/ref&gt; The image depicts a woman, evidently an ''[[ama diver|ama]]'' (a shell diver), enveloped in the [[cephalopod limb|limbs]] of two octopuses. The larger of the two mollusks performs [[cunnilingus]] on her, while the smaller one, his offspring, assists by fondling the woman's mouth and left nipple. In the text above the image the woman and the creatures express their mutual sexual pleasure from the encounter.&lt;ref name=Uhlenbeck&gt;Uhlenbeck, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

All designs in the publication are untitled; this design is generally known in Japanese as ''Tako to ama'', translated variously into English. [[Richard Douglas Lane]] calls it ''Girl Diver and Octopi'';&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Matthi Forrer calls it ''Pearl Diver and Two Octopi'';&lt;ref&gt;Forrer, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; and Danielle Talerico calls it ''Diver and Two Octopi''.&lt;ref name=Talerico&gt;Talerico 24-42.&lt;/ref&gt; The open book measures 6½" × 8&amp;frac34;" (16.51&amp;nbsp;cm × 22.23&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akantiek.nl/hokusai%20p1290.htm Famous Shunga Masterpiece Diving Girl With Octopus - Hokusai - c.1814]  AK Antiek.

==Interpretations==
[[File:Tamatori being pursued bya dragon.jpg|thumb|left|Woodblock print by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] depicting Tamatori's escape from [[Ryūjin]] and his sea creatures]]
[[File:Tamakatzura Tamatori attacked by the octopus.jpg|thumb|Woodblock print by Kuniyoshi depicting Tamatori fighting an octopus]]

Scholar Danielle Talerico notes that the image would have recalled to the minds of contemporary viewers the story of [[Tide jewels#Later references|Princess Tamatori]], highly popular in the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref name=Uhlenbeck/&gt; In this story, Tamatori is a modest shell diver who marries [[Fujiwara no Fuhito]] of the [[Fujiwara clan]], who is searching for a pearl stolen from his family by [[Ryūjin]], the dragon god of the sea. Vowing to help, Tamatori dives down to Ryūjin's undersea palace of [[Ryūgū-jō]], and is pursued by the god and his army of sea creatures, including octopuses. She cuts open her own breast and places the jewel inside; this allows her to swim faster and escape, but she dies from her wound soon after reaching the surface.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;Miller, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tamatori story was a popular subject in [[ukiyo-e]] art. The artist [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] produced works based on it, which often include octopuses among the creatures being evaded by the bare-breasted diver.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; In the text above Hokusai's image, the big octopus says he will bring the girl to Ryūjin's undersea palace, strengthening the connection to the Tamatori legend.&lt;ref name=Talerico/&gt; ''The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife'' is not the only work of Edo-period art to depict erotic relations between a woman and an octopus. Some early [[netsuke]] carvings show cephalopods fondling nude women.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Symmes, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Hokusai's contemporary [[Yanagawa Shigenobu]] created an image of a woman receiving cunnilingus from an octopus very similar to Hokusai's in his collection ''Suetsumuhana'' of 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.stolaf.edu/people/kucera/YoshidaWebsite/evolution/essay_pages/anne_lenehan_white.htm|title= Shunga and Ukiyo-e: Spring Pictures and Pictures of the Floating World|last1= Lenehan-White|first1= Anne|work= |publisher= www.stolaf.edu|accessdate= 6 November 2010|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090204154824/http://stolaf.edu/people/kucera/YoshidaWebsite/evolution/essay_pages/anne_lenehan_white.htm|archivedate= 4 February 2009|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talerico notes that earlier Western critics such as [[Edmond de Goncourt]] and Jack Hillier interpreted the work as a [[rape]] scene. She notes that these scholars would have seen it apart from the ''Kinoe no Komatsu'' collection and without understanding the text and visual references, depriving it of its original context.&lt;ref name=Talerico/&gt; Goncourt did, however, know its original context, which he describes in a passage of his monograph on Hokusai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hokusai|last=Goncourt|first=Edmond de|publisher=Bibliothèque Charpentier|year=1896|isbn=|location=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k82459v|pages=174–175|via=Gallica}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chris Uhlenbeck and Margarita Winkel, "[t]his print is testimony to how our interpretation of an image can be distorted when seen in isolation and without understanding the text."&lt;ref name=Uhlenbeck/&gt;

==Influence==
The image is often cited as a forerunner of [[tentacle erotica]], a motif that has been common in modern Japanese animation and [[manga]] since the late 20th century, popularized by author [[Toshio Maeda]]. Modern tentacle erotica similarly depicts sex between women and tentacled beasts; the sex in modern depictions is typically [[rape|forced]], as opposed to Hokusai's mutually pleasurable interaction.&lt;ref name=Briel&gt;Briel, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist and critic Jerry S. Piven is skeptical that Hokusai's playful image could account for the violent depictions in modern media, arguing that these are instead a product of the turmoil experienced throughout Japanese society following [[World War II]], which was in turn reflective of existing, underlying currents of cultural trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Piven, p. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Holger Briel argues that "only in a society that already has a predilection for monsters and is used to interacting with octopods such images might arise", citing Hokusai's print an early exemplar of such a tradition.&lt;ref name=Briel/&gt;

The work has influenced later artists such as [[Félicien Rops]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Louis Aucoc]], [[Fernand Khnopff]] and [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;Bru, pp. 55–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso painted his own version in 1903 that has been shown next to Hokusai's original in exhibits on the influence of 19th-century Japanese art on Picasso's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Picasso's Japanese erotic inspiration on show in Barcelona|first= |last= |newspaper= [[The Independent]]|date= 6 November 2009 |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/picassos-japanese-erotic-inspiration-on-show-in-barcelona-1815988.html|accessdate=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, a derivative work by Australian painter David Laity,  titled ''The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife'', sparked a minor obscenity controversy when it was shown at a gallery in [[Melbourne]]; after receiving complaints Melbourne police investigated and  decided it did not break the city's anti-pornography laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Love is a many-tentacled thing... |first= |last= |newspaper= [[The New Zealand Herald]]|date= 21 October 2003 |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=3529966|agency=[[New Zealand Press Association]]|accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Melbourne row over art 'porn'|first= David|last= Fickling |newspaper= [[The Guardian]]|date= 22 October 2003 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/22/arts.australia|agency=|accessdate=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hokusai's print has had a wide influence on the modern Japanese-American artist [[Masami Teraoka]], who has created images of women, including a recurring "pearl diver" character, being pleasured by cephalopods as a symbol of female sexual power.&lt;ref&gt;Bing, pp. 44–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called ''aria della piovra'' ("Octopus aria") ''Un dì, ero piccina'' in [[Pietro Mascagni]]'s opera ''[[Iris (opera)|Iris]]'' (1898), on a libretto by [[Luigi Illica]], may have been inspired by this print. The main character Iris describes a screen she had seen in a Buddhist temple when she was a child, depicting an octopus coiling its limbs around a smiling young woman and killing her. She recalls a Buddhist priest explaining: "That octopus is Pleasure... That octopus is Death!"&lt;ref&gt;Mallach, p. 127 and note.&lt;/ref&gt;

The print is featured briefly in Park Chan Wook's ''[[The Handmaiden]]'' and is intended to illustrate the perverted nature of Uncle Kouzuki's oppression of Lady Hideko to Sook-Hee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thefilmstage.com/reviews/cannes-review-the-handmaiden/|title=[Cannes Review] The Handmaiden|date=14 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gets more air time in several episodes of the television series ''[[Mad Men]]'', first on the office wall of founding Sterling-Cooper partner Bert Cooper; the print is given to [[Peggy Olson]] by [[Roger Sterling|Roger Sterling, Jr.]] near the [[Person to Person (Mad Men)|series' end]]. Olson decides to hang the print in her office, part of the culmination of her storyline of becoming comfortable as an executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fusion.net/story/129910/what-you-need-to-know-about-that-octopus-erotica-on-mad-men-last-night/|title=What you need to know about that octopus erotica on 'Mad Men'|first=Molly|last=Fitzpatrick|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1359">'''''Allegories of the Five Senses''''' is a series of early 17th century painting by the Spanish artist [[Jusepe de Ribera]]. One of the series (''Hearing'') has been lost and is only known through copies.

According the art historian [[Giulio Mancini]], a contemporary of the artist, their commissioner was Spanish but they were probably produced during Ribera's stay in Rome - Alfonso Pérez Sánchez dates their production to between 1611 and 1615{{sfn|Sánchez et Spinosa|p=60}}.

'''''The Meaning of Liff''''' (UK Edition: {{ISBN|0-330-28121-6}}, US Edition: {{ISBN|0-517-55347-3}}) is a humorous [[dictionary]] of [[toponymy]] and [[etymology]], written by [[Douglas Adams]] and [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]],&lt;ref name="GD"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/15/douglas-adams-meaning-of-liff|title=Douglas Adams's Meaning of Liff redefined|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=15 October 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the United Kingdom in 1983 and the United States in 1984.

==Content==
The book is a "dictionary of things that there aren't any words for yet".&lt;ref name="art1"&gt;Gartner, Michael (15 March 1987). [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/104356826.html?dids=104356826:104356826&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+15%2C+1987&amp;author=By+Michael+Gartner&amp;pub=Newsday+%28Combined+editions%29&amp;desc=WORDS&amp;pqatl=google Words], ''[[Newsday]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than inventing new words, Adams and Lloyd picked a number of existing place-names and assigned interesting meanings to them,&lt;ref name="parkvall"&gt;{{cite book|title=Limits of Language: Almost Everything You Didn't Know about Language and Languages|first=Mikael|last=Parkvall|year=2006|publisher=William James &amp; Company|isbn=1590281985}}&lt;/ref&gt; meanings that can be regarded as on the verge of social existence and ready to become recognisable entities.&lt;ref name="kalaga"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nebulae of discourse: interpretation, textuality and the subject|first=Wojciech|last=Kalaga|year=1997|publisher=Peter Lang Pub.|isbn=082043289X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the words listed are [[toponyms]] and describe common feelings and objects for which there is no current English word. Examples are ''[[Shoeburyness]]'' ("The vague uncomfortable feeling you get when sitting on a seat that is still warm from somebody else's bottom") and ''[[Plymouth]]'' ("To relate an amusing story to someone without remembering that it was they who told it to you in the first place").

The book cover usually bears the tagline "This book will change your life", either as part of its cover or as an [[adhesive label]]. ''[[Liff, Angus|Liff]]'' (a village near [[Dundee]] in Scotland) is then defined in the book as "A book, the contents of which are totally belied by its cover. For instance, any book the [[dust jacket]] of which bears the words, 'This book will change your life'."

==Origin and publication==
According to Adams' account, the idea behind ''The Meaning of Liff'' grew out of an old school game and started when he and Lloyd were on holiday together in [[Corfu]] in 1978 during the writing of the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (novel)|first Hitchhiker's novel]].&lt;ref name=GD/&gt;&lt;ref name=hitchhiker&gt;{{cite book|title=Hitchhiker|first=M.J.|last=Simpson|year=2003|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|isbn=0-340-82489-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was used as part of the ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'' spin-off book ''Not 1982'' ({{ISBN|0-571-11853-4}}), where they were headed "Today's new word from the Oxtail English Dictionary". The suggestion of turning this into a complete book in itself came from Faber MD [[Matthew Evans, Baron Evans of Temple Guiting|Matthew Evans]]. The bulk of the text was written by Adams and Lloyd in Summer 1982 in [[Malibu, California]].&lt;ref name=hitchhiker /&gt;

Essentially the same idea was used by the English humourist [[Paul Jennings (UK author)|Paul Jennings]] in an article ''Ware, Wye, Watford'', published in the late 1950s. Adams speculated that the teacher who originated the school game may have done so after reading the article. He sent a note of apology to Jennings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Don't Panic: Douglas Adams &amp; The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy|isbn=1-85286-411-7|first=Neil|last=Gaiman|publisher=Titan Books|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow humourist [[Miles Kington]] defended Adams and Lloyd in his column in ''The Times'', noting a difference in style.

The book was released in the UK in November 1983 in time for the Christmas market. It was a commercial success for [[Pan Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The rising of the lark: Britain's best-selling books|date=29 December 1983|publisher=Financial Times|first=Arthur|last=Sandles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the book was chosen to be very similar to [[Monty Python]]'s film ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life|The Meaning of Life]]'' that was being produced at the same time, after Douglas Adams called [[Terry Jones]] to ask if it would be OK. Adams' idea was that the potential confusion with the film's script would help to sell more copies of the book.&lt;ref&gt;John Lloyd explained this in a BBC Radio 4 Documentary of the Week, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the book's publication, which included guest star Terry Jones (first aired 1 March 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in the beginning of the Monty Python film, the gravestone with the title "The Meaning of Liff" appears before a lightning bolt strikes the last F and converts it to an E.

==Versions==
A revised and expanded edition of the original book, with about twice as many definitions, was published in 1990 as '''''The Deeper Meaning of Liff''''' (UK Edition: {{ISBN|0-330-31606-0}}, US Edition: {{ISBN|0-517-58597-9}}), though the original remains in print. Some of the new words in ''Deeper'' had previously appeared in a Liff piece by Adams, Lloyd and [[Stephen Fry]] in ''[[The Utterly Utterly Merry Comic Relief Christmas Book]]'' (1986). The main differences between the two editions (for either version of the book) are those of American English v. British English spellings, though ''The Deeper Meaning of Liff'' contains different definitions for both the word "Glossop" and the titular word "Liff". In ''The Deeper Meaning of Liff'', Liff is defined as a phenomenon for which there is no word.

Another edition in the series, ''Afterliff'', has been released, with more entries contributed by Lloyd, [[Jon Canter]] and Douglas Adams' daughter Polly.&lt;ref name=GD /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/09/afterliff-douglas-adams-jon-canter|title=Afterliff: The spirit of Douglas Adams|last=Canter|first=Jon|date=9 August 2013|work=[[theguardian.com]]|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A German adaptation was made by Sven Böttcher under the title ''Der tiefere Sinn des Labenz'', published in 1992 ({{ISBN|3-453-87960-0}}). The meanings are translated from the original but are matched to place names that convey the humorous effect in German. The most recent edition includes both the German adaptation and the English original ({{ISBN|3-453-87960-0}}).
 
In 1989, a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] version was published under the title ''Kunt U Breukelen?'' by Justus van Oel (Nijgh &amp; van Ditmar, {{ISBN|90 236 7311 5}}), utilising the same book size format as the standard UK version, 9.1 x 16.8&amp;nbsp;cm. The book used place names mainly from the Netherlands, as well as a handful from neighbouring Belgium and [[Luxembourg]]. There was no hardback edition, and neither was ''The Deeper Meaning of Liff'' adapted for the Dutch market. It was reissued in 2000 with a different cover.

The Finnish adaptations "Elimäen tarkoitus" and "Elimäen perimmäinen tarkoitus" were published in 1996 and 1997 ({{ISBN|952-9646-26-7}} and {{ISBN|952-9646-52-6}}).

Following the 2005 movie and the TV adaptations of ''[[Last Chance to See]]'' and ''Dirk Gently'', there was talk from ITV, never as yet acted upon, of a TV version of ''The Meaning Of Liff''.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

'''''The Reluctant Fundamentalist''''' is a novel by [[Pakistani]] author [[Mohsin Hamid]], published in 2007.

The novel uses the technique of a [[frame story]], which takes place during the course of a single evening in an outdoor [[Lahore]] cafe, where a bearded Pakistani man called Changez tells a nervous American stranger about his love affair with an American woman, and his eventual abandonment of America. A short story adapted from the novel, called "Focus on the Fundamentals," appeared in the fall 2006 issue of ''[[The Paris Review]]''. A [[The Reluctant Fundamentalist (film)|film adaptation]] of the novel by director [[Mira Nair]] premiered at the 2012 [[Venice Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19421160 |title= 'The Reluctant Fundamentalist Opens Venice Film Festival' |date= 30 August 2012 |work= Screen|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot/Summary ==
The story begins on the streets of Lahore. A Pakistani man, Changez, offers to direct an American visitor where he can find a good cup of tea. As they wait for their tea, Changez begins to weave a long story about his life, especially his time living in the United States - in between making remarks about the [[History of Lahore|history]], [[List of places in Lahore|landmarks]] and society of Lahore, his native city which he loves and of which he is proud. The unnamed American is restless but remains to listen.

Changez tells the American he was an excellent student who, after completing his bachelor's degree in Finance, joined Underwood Samson, a consultancy firm, as an analyst. After graduating from [[Princeton University]], he vacationed in Greece with fellow Princetonians, where he met Erica, an aspiring writer. He was instantly smitten by her, but his feelings remained almost unrequited because she was still grieving over the death of her childhood sweetheart Chris, who succumbed to lung cancer. After a date, they return to his place and he proceeds to have sex with her, but stops because her emotional attachment to Chris prevents her from becoming aroused. After this incident there is an interlude where neither contact each other. But soon they go on another date, after which they have sex when Changez convinces Erica to close her eyes and fantasize that she is with Chris. Though Changez is satisfied at this development in their relationship, this irreversibly damages their relationship. Soon she begins treatment in a mental institution. He notices she is physically emaciated and no longer her former self. After this meeting he travels to Chile on an assignment. When he returns to meet her, it is found that she has left the institution and her clothes were found near the Hudson River. Officially she is stated as a missing person, as her body has not been found.

In his professional life, he impresses his peers and gets earmarked by his superiors for his work, especially Jim, the person who recruited him, develops a good rapport with him, and holds him in high esteem. This prompts the firm to send him to offshore assignments in the Philippines and [[Valparaíso]], Chile. In Chile, he is very distracted due to developments in the world and, responding to the parabolic suggestion of the publisher his company is there to assess (which would lead to its break up), he visits the nearby preserved home of the late left-wing poet [[Pablo Neruda]] and comes to see himself as a servant of the American empire that has constantly interfered with and manipulated his [[Pakistan|homeland]]. He returns from Chile to New York without completing the assignment and ends up losing his job.

Politically, Changez is surprised by his own reaction to the [[September 11th attacks]]. "Yes, despicable as it may sound, my initial reaction was to be remarkably pleased", he tells the American. He observes the air of suspicion towards Pakistanis. Changez, due to his privileged position in society, is not among those detained or otherwise abused, but he notices a change in his treatment in public. To express solidarity with his countrymen after his trip to Chile, he starts to grow a beard. After the [[2001 Indian Parliament attack]], India and Pakistan mobilize leading to a [[2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff|standoff]]. Noticing the US response to this situation, he has an epiphany that his country is being used as a pawn. With no job, an expiring visa and no reason to stay in the United States, he moves back to Lahore.

After returning to Lahore, he becomes a professor of finance at the local university. His experience and insight in world issues gains his admiration among students. As a result, he becomes a mentor to large groups of students on various issues. He and his students actively participate in demonstrations against policies that were detrimental to the sovereignty of Pakistan. Changez advocates nonviolence, but a relatively unknown student gets apprehended for an assassination attempt on an American representative, which brings the spotlight on Changez. In a widely televised interview, he strongly criticizes the militarism of [[U.S. foreign policy]]. This act makes people surrounding him think that someone might be sent to intimidate him or worse.

As they sit in the cafe, Changez keeps noting that the American stranger is very apprehensive of their surroundings, that he is in possession of a sophisticated [[satellite phone]] on which he is repeatedly messaging, and that under his clothing there is a bulge which might be a gun. Changez walks the stranger toward his hotel. As they walk, the American, now highly suspicious that he is in immediate danger, reaches into his pocket, possibly for a gun. Changez says he trusts it is simply his holder of business cards. But the novel ends without revealing what was in his pocket, leaving the reader to wonder if the stranger was a [[CIA]] agent, possibly there to kill Changez, or if Changez, in collusion with the waiter from the cafe, had planned all along to do harm to the American.

==Style==
''The Reluctant Fundamentalist'' is an example of a [[dramatic monologue]].&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, gen. Ed. "Dramatic Monologue" ''A Glossary of Literary Terms''. 8th ed. Boston: Thomson Wadsworth, 2005. pp. 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being Auto-Digetic.

'''''The Silmarillion''''' &lt;small&gt;(pronounced: [[Sindarin|/sɪlmaˈrɪljɔn/]])&lt;/small&gt; is a collection of [[Mythopoeia|mythopoeic]] works by English writer [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], edited and published posthumously by his son, [[Christopher Tolkien]], in 1977, with assistance from [[Guy Gavriel Kay]].&lt;ref name="Silf"&gt;{{Harv|Silmarillion|1977|loc=Foreword|Ref=Silmarillion}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Silmarillion'', along with J. R. R. Tolkien's other works, forms an extensive, though incomplete, narrative that describes the universe of [[Eä]] in which are found the lands of [[Valinor]], [[Beleriand]], [[Númenor]], and [[Middle-earth]], within which ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' take place.

After the success of ''The Hobbit'', Tolkien's publisher requested a sequel. Tolkien sent them an early draft of ''The Silmarillion'' but they rejected the work as being obscure and "too Celtic". The result was that Tolkien began work on "A Long Expected Party", the first chapter of what he described at the time as "a new story about [[Hobbit]]s", which became ''The Lord of the Rings''.&lt;ref name=beleriand&gt;{{Citation|title=The Lays of Beleriand|last=Tolkien |first=J.R.R.|publisher=Ballantine|editor=Christopher Tolkien|pages=433–4|isbn=0-345-38818-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Silmarillion'' comprises five parts. The first part, ''[[Ainulindalë]]'', tells of the creation of Eä, the "world that ''is''". ''[[Valaquenta]]'', the second part, gives a description of the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] and [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maiar]], the supernatural powers in Eä. The next section, ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', which forms the bulk of the collection, chronicles the history of the events before and during the [[First Age]], including the wars over the [[Silmaril]]s that gave the book its title. The fourth part, ''[[Akallabêth]]'', relates the history of the Downfall of Númenor and its people, which takes place in the [[Second Age]]. The final part, ''[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]'', is a brief account of the circumstances which led to and were presented in ''The Lord of the Rings''.

The five parts were initially separate works, but it was the elder Tolkien's express wish that they be published together.&lt;ref name="Silf" /&gt; Because J. R. R. Tolkien died before he finished revising the various legends, Christopher gathered material from his father's older writings to fill out the book. In a few cases, this meant that he had to devise completely new material in order to resolve gaps and inconsistencies in the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=My father's "eviscerated" work – son of Hobbit scribe J.R.R.

==Overview==
''The Silmarillion'', like Tolkien's other [[Middle-earth writings]], was meant to have taken place at some time in Earth's past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#165, 211}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with this idea, ''The Silmarillion'' is meant to have been translated from [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s three-volume ''[[Red Book of Westmarch|Translations from the Elvish]]'', which he wrote while at [[Rivendell]].&lt;ref name="BoLTF"&gt;{{ME-ref|BolT|Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapters in the book include:
*"The [[Music of the Ainur]]"
*"Quenta Silmarillion" (the history of the [[Silmaril]]s and the war of the [[Noldor]] against [[Morgoth]])
*"Of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]]"
*"[[Túrin Turambar]]" (closely associated with "[[Narn i Hîn Húrin|Narn i Chîn Húrin: The Tale of the Children of Húrin]]" in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' and ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'') &lt;!-- please note Chîn is the correct spelling --&gt;
*"Of [[Tuor]] and The Fall of [[Gondolin]]"
*"Of the Voyage of [[Eärendil]] and the [[War of Wrath]]"

The inside title page contains an inscription written in [[Tengwar]]. In the common script, it reads "The tales of the [[First Age]] when [[Morgoth]] dwelt in Middle-earth and the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] made war upon him for the recovery of the Silmarils to which are appended the downfall of Númenor and the history of the [[Rings of Power]] and the Third Age in which these tales come to their end."

==Synopsis==
{{Silmarillion}}

===''Ainulindalë'' and ''Valaquenta''===
{{Main article|Ainulindalë|Valaquenta}}

The first section of ''The Silmarillion'', ''Ainulindalë'' ("The Music of the [[Ainu (Middle-earth)|Ainur]]"&lt;ref name="SilNameIndex"&gt;{{Harv|Silmarillion|1977|loc=Index of Names|Ref=Silmarillion}}&lt;/ref&gt;), takes the form of a primary creation narrative. Eru ("The One"&lt;ref&gt;(Silmarillion 1977, pp. 15, 329)&lt;/ref&gt;), also called [[Eru Ilúvatar|Ilúvatar]] ("Father of All"), first created the Ainur, a group of eternal spirits or [[demiurge]]s, called "the offspring of his thought". Ilúvatar brought the Ainur together and showed them a theme, from which he bade them make a great music. [[Morgoth|Melkor]] – whom Ilúvatar had given the "greatest power and knowledge" of all the Ainur – broke from the harmony of the music to develop his own song. Some Ainur joined him, while others continued to follow Ilúvatar, causing discord in the music. This happened thrice, with Eru Ilúvatar successfully overpowering his rebellious subordinate with a new theme each time. Ilúvatar then stopped the music and showed them a vision of [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] and its peoples. The vision disappeared after a while, and Ilúvatar offered the Ainur a chance to enter into Arda and govern over the new world.

Many Ainur descended, taking physical form and becoming bound to that world. The greater Ainur became known as the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]], while the lesser Ainur were called the [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maiar]]. The Valar attempted to prepare the world for the coming inhabitants (Elves and [[Men (Middle-earth)|Men]]), while Melkor, who wanted Arda for himself, repeatedly destroyed their work; this went on for thousands of years until, through waves of destruction and creation, the world took shape.

''Valaquenta'' ("Account of the Valar"&lt;ref name="SilNameIndex" /&gt;) describes Melkor and each of the 14 Valar in detail, as well as a few of the Maiar. It also reveals how Melkor seduced many Maiar – including those who would eventually become [[Sauron]] and the [[Balrog]]s – into his service.

===''Quenta Silmarillion''===
{{Main article|Quenta Silmarillion}}

''Quenta Silmarillion'' ("The History of the [[Silmaril]]s"&lt;ref name="SilNameIndex" /&gt;), which makes up the bulk of the book, is a series of interconnected tales set in the First Age that make up the tragic saga of the three jewels, the Silmarils.

The Valar had attempted to fashion the world for [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] and [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], but Melkor continually destroyed their handiwork. After he destroyed the two lamps that illuminated the world, the Valar moved to [[Aman (Middle-earth)|Aman]], a continent to the west of Middle-earth, where they established their home called [[Valinor]]. [[Yavanna]] created [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]] that illuminated Valinor and left Middle-earth to darkness and Melkor. Soon after, stars created by [[Varda]] began to shine and the [[Awakening of the Elves|Elves awoke]]. The elves originally formed three groups: the [[Vanyar]], the [[Noldor]], and the [[Teleri]], though some elves were captured and enslaved by Melkor, eventually to be bred into [[orc]]s. Knowing the danger the Elves were in, the Valar decided to fight Melkor to keep the Elves safe. After defeating and capturing Melkor, they invited the Elves to live in Aman. Many Elves travelled to Aman, while others refused and still others stopped along the way, including the Elves who later became the [[Sindar]], ruled by the Elf King [[Thingol]] and [[Melian]], a Maia. Of the three tribes that set out, all of the [[Vanyar]] and [[Noldor]], and many of the [[Teleri]] reached Aman.

In Aman, [[Fëanor]], son of [[Finwë]], King of the Noldor, created the Silmarils, jewels that glowed with the light of the Two Trees. Melkor, who had been held in captivity by the Valar, was eventually released after feigning repentance. Upon release, Melkor deceived Fëanor into believing that his eldest half-brother [[Fingolfin]] was attempting a coup against [[Finwë]]. This rift led to the banishment of [[Fëanor]] from the Noldor city [[Tirion]], and Fëanor thereafter created the fortress Formenos to the North of [[Tirion]]. Finwë moved to Formenos to live with Fëanor, his favourite of three sons, and there they safely kept the Silmarils. After many years, Fëanor travelled to Tirion to make amends with Fingolfin, while Finwë stayed at Formenos. While making amends, Melkor destroyed the Two Trees with the help of [[Ungoliant]], a dark spider spirit Melkor found in Avathar, on the Southeast side of Aman. Together, Melkor and Ungoliant then escaped to Formenos, killed Finwë, stole the Silmarils, and fled to Middle-earth. Melkor kept the Silmarils and banished Ungoliant, later attacking the Elvish kingdom of [[Doriath]], ruled by the Elf King [[Thingol]] and his wife [[Melian]]. He was defeated in the [[Battles of Beleriand|first of five battles of Beleriand]], however, and barricaded himself in his northern fortress of [[Angband]].

Fëanor and his sons swore an oath of vengeance against Melkor – and against anyone who withheld the Silmarils from them, even the Valar. Fëanor persuaded most of the Noldor to pursue Melkor, whom [[Fëanor]] renamed as [[Morgoth]], into Middle-earth. Fëanor's sons seized ships from the Teleri, attacking and killing many of them, and left the other Noldor to make the voyage by foot. Upon arriving in Middle-earth, the Noldor under Fëanor attacked Melkor and defeated his host, though Fëanor was slain by Balrogs. After a period of peace, Melkor attacked the Noldor but was again defeated and besieged. Nearly 400 years later, he broke the siege and drove the Noldor back.

After the destruction of the Trees and the theft of the Silmarils, the Valar created the moon and the sun. At the same time, Men awoke, some of whom later arrived in Beleriand and allied themselves with the Elves. [[Beren]], a man who had survived the latest battle, wandered to Doriath, where he fell in love with the elf [[Lúthien]], the king's daughter. The king sought to prevent their marriage by imposing what he believed an impossible task: retrieving one of the Silmarils from Melkor. But together, Beren and Lúthien embarked on this quest. [[Sauron]], a powerful servant of Melkor, imprisoned Beren along the way; but with Lúthien's help he escaped, crept into Melkor's fortress, and stole a Silmaril from Melkor's crown. Having achieved the task, the first union of man and elf was formed, though Beren was soon mortally wounded and Lúthien also died of grief. However she convinced the Vala [[Mandos]] to revive Beren and herself, choosing to sacrifice her immortality in favour of a mortal life with her beloved.

The Noldor, seeing that a mortal and an elf-woman could infiltrate Angband, perceived that Melkor was not invincible. They attacked again with a great army of Elves, [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] and Men. But they were deceived by Melkor, who had secretly darkened the hearts of many of the men. Thus it was that the Elvish host were utterly defeated, due in part to the treachery of some Men. However, many Men remained loyal to the Elves and were honoured thereafter.

None received more honour than the brothers [[Húrin]] and [[Huor]]. Huor died in battle, but Melkor captured Húrin, and cursed him to watch the downfall of his kin. Húrin's son, [[Túrin Turambar]], was sent to Doriath, leaving his mother and unborn sister behind in his father's kingdom (which had been overrun by the enemy). Túrin achieved many great deeds of valour, the greatest being the defeat of the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]] [[Glaurung]]. Despite his heroism, however, Túrin was plagued by the curse of Melkor, which led him unwittingly to murder his friend [[Beleg]] and to marry and impregnate his sister [[Nienor Níniel|Nienor]], whom he had never met before, and who had lost her memory through Glaurung's enchantment. Before their child was born, the bewitchment was lifted as the dragon lay dying. Nienor, realizing what grew within her, took her own life. Upon learning the truth, Túrin threw himself on his sword.

Huor's son, [[Tuor]], became involved in the fate of the hidden Noldorin kingdom of Gondolin. He married the elf [[Idril]], daughter of [[Turgon]], Lord of [[Gondolin]] (the second union between Elves and Men). When Gondolin fell, betrayed from within by [[Maeglin]], Tuor saved many of its inhabitants from destruction. All of the Elvish kingdoms in Beleriand eventually fell, and the refugees fled to a haven by the sea created by Tuor. The son of Tuor and Idril, [[Eärendil]] the [[Half-elven]], was betrothed to [[Elwing]], herself descended from Beren and Lúthien. Elwing brought Eärendil the Silmaril of Beren and Lúthien, and using its light Eärendil travelled across the sea to Aman to seek help from the Valar. The Valar obliged; they attacked and defeated Melkor, completely destroying his fortress [[Angband]] and sinking most of [[Beleriand]]; and they expelled Melkor from Arda. This ended the First Age of Middle-earth. The last two Silmarils were taken by [[Fëanor]]'s surviving sons [[Maedhros]] and Maglor. However, Maedhros killed himself by leaping into a fiery chasm with a Silmaril while Maglor threw his into the sea and spent the rest of his days wandering along the shores of the world, singing his grief.

Eärendil and Elwing had two children: [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]]. As descendants of immortal elves and mortal men, they were given the choice of which lineage to belong to: Elrond chose to belong to the Elves, his brother to Men. Elros became the first king of Númenor and lived to 500 years old, being given an extended life in return for choosing to be a Man.

===''Akallabêth''===
{{Main article|Akallabêth}}

''Akallabêth'' ("The Downfallen"&lt;ref name="SilNameIndex" /&gt;) comprises about 30 pages, and recounts the rise and fall of the island kingdom of [[Númenor]], inhabited by the [[Dúnedain]]. After the defeat of Melkor, the Valar gave the island to the [[Edain|three loyal houses of Men]] who had aided the Elves in the war against him. Through the favour of the Valar, the Dúnedain were granted wisdom and power and life more enduring than any other of mortal race had possessed, making them comparable to the High-Elves of [[Aman (Middle-earth)|Aman]]. Indeed, the isle of Númenor lay closer to Aman than to Middle-earth. But their power lay in their bliss and their acceptance of mortality. The fall of Númenor came about in large measure through the influence of the corrupted Maia [[Sauron]] (the chief servant of Melkor), who arose during the Second Age and tried to conquer Middle-earth.

The Númenóreans moved against Sauron, who saw that he could not defeat them by force and allowed himself to be taken as a prisoner to Númenor. There he quickly enthralled the king, [[Ar-Pharazôn]], urging him to seek out the immortality that the Valar had apparently denied him, thus nurturing the seeds of envy that the Númenóreans had begun to hold against the Elves of the West and the Valar. So it was that all the knowledge and power of Númenor was turned towards seeking an avoidance of death; but this only weakened them and sped the gradual waning of the lifespans to something more similar to that of other Men. Sauron urged them to wage war against the Valar themselves to win immortality, and to worship his master Melkor, whom he said could grant them their wish. Ar-Pharazôn created the mightiest army and fleet Númenor had seen, and sailed against Aman. The Valar and Elves of Aman, stricken with grief over their betrayal, called on [[Ilúvatar]] for help. When Ar-Pharazôn landed, Ilúvatar destroyed his fleet and drowned Númenor itself as punishment for the rebellion against the rightful rule of the Valar. Ilúvatar created a great wave, such as had never before been seen, which utterly destroyed and submerged the isle of Númenor, killing all but those Dúnedain who had already sailed east, and changing the shape of all the lands of Middle-earth.

Sauron's physical manifestation was also destroyed in the ruin of Númenor, but as a Maia, his spirit returned to Middle-earth, no longer able to take upon himself the fair form he once had. Some Númenóreans who had remained loyal to the Valar were spared and were washed up on the shores of Middle-earth. Among these survivors were [[Elendil]] their leader, a descendant of Elros, and his two sons [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]] who had also saved a seedling from Númenor's white tree, the ancestor of that of Gondor. They founded the Númenórean Kingdoms in Exile:  [[Arnor]] in the north and [[Gondor]] in the south.  Elendil reigned as High-king of both kingdoms, but committed the rule of Gondor jointly to Isildur and Anárion.  The power of the kingdoms in exile was greatly diminished from that of Númenor, "yet very great it seemed to the wild men of Middle-earth".

At the end, it is mentioned that the sunken Númenor came to be called "Atalantë", a name not used when it existed. This led many readers to the conclusion that Númenor is [[Atlantis]]; this direct link was, however, denied by Tolkien himself, who asserted that it's a natural word following the constructs of [[Quenya]].

===''Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age''===
{{Main article|Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age}}

The concluding section of the book, comprising about 20 pages, describes the events that take place in Middle-earth during the Second and [[Third Age]]s. In the Second Age, Sauron emerged as the main power in Middle-earth, and the Rings of Power were forged by Elves led by [[Celebrimbor]]. Sauron secretly forged [[One Ring|his own ring]] to control the others, which led to war between the peoples of Middle-earth and Sauron, culminating in the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|War of the Last Alliance]], in which Elves and the remaining Númenóreans united to defeat Sauron, bringing the Second Age to an end. The Third Age began with the passing of the [[One Ring]] to [[Isildur]], who was ambushed at the [[Gladden Fields]] shortly afterwards, and lost the ring in the [[Anduin|River Anduin]]. This section also gives a brief overview of the events leading up to and taking place in ''The Lord of the Rings'', including the waning of Gondor, the re-emergence of Sauron, the [[White Council]], [[Saruman]]'s treachery, and Sauron's final destruction along with the One Ring, after which the ages of magic end.

==Concept and creation==

===Development of the text===
Tolkien first began working on the stories that would become ''The Silmarillion'' in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#115}}&lt;/ref&gt; intending them to become an English mythology that would explain the origins of English history and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#131, 180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this early work was written while Tolkien, then a British officer returned from France during World War I, was in hospital and on sick leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#165, 180, 282}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed the first story, "[[The Fall of Gondolin]]", in late 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#163, 165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He called his collection of nascent stories ''The Book of Lost Tales''.&lt;ref name="BoLTF" /&gt; This became the name for the first two volumes of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', which include these early texts. The stories employ the narrative device of a mariner named Eriol (in later versions, an Anglo-Saxon named [[Ælfwine of England|Ælfwine]]) who finds the island of [[Tol Eressëa]], where the Elves live; and the Elves tell him their history.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|BolT|Chapter I, "The Cottage of Lost Play"}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tolkien never completed ''The Book of Lost Tales''; he left it to compose the poems "[[The Lay of Leithian]]" and "[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]".&lt;ref name="BoLTF" /&gt;

The first complete version of ''The Silmarillion'' was the "Sketch of the Mythology" written in 1926&lt;ref name="LoB1"&gt;{{ME-ref|LoB|Chapter I, "The Lay of the Children of Húrin"}}&lt;/ref&gt; (later published in Volume IV of ''The History of Middle-earth''). The "Sketch" was a 28-page synopsis written to explain the background of the story of [[Túrin]] to R. W. Reynolds, a friend to whom Tolkien had sent several of the stories.&lt;ref name="LoB1" /&gt; From the "Sketch" Tolkien developed a fuller narrative version of ''The Silmarillion'' called ''Quenta Noldorinwa''&lt;ref name="SoMEP"&gt;{{ME-ref|SoME|Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also included in Volume IV). The ''Quenta Noldorinwa'' was the last version of ''The Silmarillion'' that Tolkien completed.&lt;ref name="SoMEP" /&gt;

In 1937, encouraged by the success of ''The Hobbit'', Tolkien submitted to his publisher [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] an incomplete but more fully developed version of ''The Silmarillion'' called ''Quenta Silmarillion'',&lt;ref name="BoLTF" /&gt; but they rejected the work as being obscure and "too [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]]".&lt;ref name="Letter19"&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher instead asked Tolkien to write a sequel to ''The Hobbit''.&lt;ref name="Letter19" /&gt; Tolkien began to revise ''The Silmarillion'', but soon turned to the sequel, which became ''The Lord of the Rings''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|LRoW|Part II, Chapter VI, "Quenta Silmarillion"}}&lt;/ref&gt; He renewed work on ''The Silmarillion'' after completing ''The Lord of the Rings'',&lt;ref name="MRF"&gt;{{ME-ref|MR|Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he greatly desired to publish the two works together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#124}}&lt;/ref&gt; But when it became clear that would not be possible, Tolkien turned his full attention to preparing ''The Lord of the Rings'' for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1950s Tolkien returned to ''The Silmarillion'', but much of his writing from this time was concerned more with the theological and philosophical underpinnings of the work than with the narratives themselves. By this time, he had doubts about fundamental aspects of the work that went back to the earliest versions of the stories, and it seems that he felt the need to resolve these problems before he could produce the "final" version of ''The Silmarillion''.&lt;ref name="MRF" /&gt; During this time he wrote extensively on such topics as the nature of evil in Arda, the origin of [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]], the customs of the Elves, the nature and means of Elvish rebirth, and the "flat" world and the story of the Sun and Moon.&lt;ref name="MRF" /&gt; In any event, with one or two exceptions, he wrought little change to the narratives during the remaining years of his life.&lt;ref name="MRF" /&gt;

===Posthumous publication===

For several years after his father's death, Christopher Tolkien compiled a ''Silmarillion'' narrative. Christopher's intentions seem to have been mostly to use the latest writings of his father's that he could,{{citation needed&lt;!--ME-fact--&gt;|date=November 2007}} and to keep as much internal consistency (and consistency with ''The Lord of the Rings'') as possible,&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|UT|Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he admitted that a complete consistency was impossible.&lt;ref name="Silf" /&gt; As explained in ''The History of Middle-earth'', Christopher drew upon numerous sources for his narrative, relying on post-Lord of the Rings works where possible, but ultimately reaching back as far as the 1917 ''Book of Lost Tales'' to fill in portions of the narrative which his father had planned to write but never addressed. In one later chapter of ''Quenta Silmarillion'', "Of the Ruin of Doriath", which had not been touched since the early 1930s, he had to construct a narrative practically from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|WotJ|Part Three, Chapter V "The Tale of Years"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final result, which included genealogies, maps, an index, and the first-ever released Elvish word list, was published in 1977.
Because of Christopher's extensive explanations (in ''The History of Middle-earth'') of how he compiled the published work, much of ''The Silmarillion'' has been debated by readers. Christopher's task is generally accepted as very difficult given the state of his father's texts at the time of his death: some critical texts were no longer in the Tolkien family's possession, and Christopher's task compelled him to rush through much of the material. Christopher reveals in later volumes of ''The History of Middle-earth'' many divergent ideas which do not agree with the published version. Christopher Tolkien has suggested that, had he taken more time and had access to all the texts, he might have produced a substantially different work. But he was compelled by considerable pressure and demand from his father's readers and publishers to produce something publishable as quickly as possible{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}.

In October 1996, Christopher Tolkien commissioned illustrator [[Ted Nasmith]] to create full-page full-colour artwork for the first illustrated edition of ''The Silmarillion''. It was published in 1998, and followed in 2004 by a second edition featuring corrections and additional artwork by Nasmith.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Christopher Tolkien published most of his father's Middle-earth writings as the 12-volume ''The History of Middle-earth'' series. In addition to the source material and earlier drafts of several portions of ''The Lord of the Rings'', these books greatly expand on the original material published in ''The Silmarillion'', and in many cases diverge from it. There is much that Tolkien intended to revise but only sketched out in notes, and some new texts surfaced after the publication of ''The Silmarillion''. These books also make it clear just how [[Unfinished work|unfinished]] the later parts of ''The Silmarillion'' really were: some parts were never rewritten after the early versions in ''Lost Tales''.

===Influences===
{{Main article|J. R. R. Tolkien's influences}}
''The Silmarillion'' is a complex work exhibiting the influence of many sources. A major influence was the [[Finnish mythology|Finnish]] epic ''[[Kalevala]]'', especially the tale of [[Kullervo]]. Influence from [[Greek mythology]] is also apparent. The island of [[Númenor]], for example, recalls [[Atlantis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#154, 227}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, Tolkien later described in a letter to Christopher Bretherton as merely a "curious chance".

Greek mythology also colours the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]], who borrow many attributes from the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]].&lt;ref name="Olympian"&gt;{{Citation

Influence of the Bible and traditional Christian narrative are seen in ''The Silmarillion'' in the conflict between Melkor and Eru Ilúvatar, a parallel of the polarity of Lucifer and God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Chance|2001|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, ''The Silmarillion'' tells of the creation and fall of the Elves, as ''Genesis'' tells of the creation and fall of Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Medieval Christian cosmology shows its influence especially in the account of the creation of the universe as the manifestation of a sort of song sung by God with which the angels harmonize until the fallen angel introduces discord. St. Augustine's writings on music, as well as the extensive medieval tradition of the divine harmony—more familiar to us today in the notion of the "[[music of the spheres]]"—served as bases for this telling of creation.

[[Celtic mythology]] show its influence in the exile of the [[Noldor]]in Elves, for example, that borrow elements from the story of [[Irish legend]]s of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]].&lt;ref name="Celtic"&gt;Fimi, Dimitra (August 2006). {{"'}}Mad' Elves and 'Elusive Beauty': Some Celtic Strands of Tolkien's Mythology". ''Folklore'', '''117'''(2), 156–170 . {{JSTOR|30035484}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Welsh influence is seen in the Elvish language [[Sindarin]], that Tolkien gave "a linguistic character very like (though not identical with) [[Welsh language|British-Welsh]] ... because it seems to fit the rather 'Celtic' type of legends and stories told of its speakers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
At the time of release, reviews of ''The Silmarillion'' were generally mixed to negative. ''The Silmarillion'' was criticized for being too serious, lacking the light-hearted moments that were found in ''The Lord of the Rings'' and especially ''The Hobbit''.&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;{{Citation

Robert M. Adams of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' called ''The Silmarillion'' "an empty and pompous bore", "not a literary event of any magnitude", and even claimed that the main reason for its "enormous sales" was the "Tolkien cult" created by the popularity of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', predicting that more people would buy ''The Silmarillion'' than would ever read it.&lt;ref name="NYRB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert M.

Nonetheless, a few reviewers praised the scope of Tolkien's creation. ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' acknowledged that "what is finally most moving is … the eccentric heroism of Tolkien's attempt".&lt;ref name="NYTBR" /&gt; ''TIME'' described ''The Silmarillion'' as "majestic, a work held so long and so powerfully in the writer's imagination that it overwhelms the reader".&lt;ref name="TIME" /&gt; The ''[[Horn Book Magazine]]'' even lauded the "remarkable set of legends conceived with imaginative might and told in beautiful language".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''''The Trial''''' (1947) is a painting by the [[Australia]]n painter [[Sidney Nolan]].

This painting depicts [[Ned Kelly]]'s trial, where Kelly is depicted in handcuffs. A judge and several people look at him in the court.  The painting is one of a number by Nolan to use [[enamel paint]], usually [[Ripolin]], a commercial paint not intended for art (and nothing to do with true [[vitreous enamel]]).

Nolan painted the picture at [[Heide Museum of Modern Art|''Heide'' at Bulleen, Victoria]], the home of [[John Reed (art patron)|John Reed]] and his wife, [[Sunday Reed|Sunday]].

[[Sunday Reed]] may have helped paint the floor of this painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Thomas | first = Sarah | year = 2004 | url = http://home.vicnet.net.au/~abr/Nov04/Thomas.htm | title = Cultivating Controversy (Review of Janine Burke, ''The Heart Garden: Sunday Reed and Heide'') | work =  | publisher =  | accessdate = 2008-02-22 | quote = Burke provocatively suggests that Sunday collaborated with him on some of his most famous works, the Kelly series among them. "The Kellys are Sunday and Nolan's swansong," Burke writes, "the last brilliant burst of their creative duet." What is most problematic here is that speculation " that Sunday painted the floor tiles and possibly the patchwork quilt in two of Nolan's paintings " is conveyed as fact. Burke's evidence is unconvincing, the main source being a quote from a subsequent letter from John Reed to Nolan, when the friendship between them had soured, that read: "Your paintings were part of your contribution [to Heide], even though you said Sunday painted them as much as you did " you said all your paintings were for Sunday, and I am quite sure you did not think of them otherwise. They were created with her in a sense which is almost literal, and it is certain without her, without your life at Heide, a great many would never have been painted." Surely the description of Sunday's contribution as being "almost literal" runs counter to Burke's argument? | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071028131131/http://home.vicnet.net.au/~abr/Nov04/Thomas.htm | archivedate = 2007-10-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She supported Nolan while he painted the Kelly series.

This painting is currently in the [[National Gallery of Australia]]. The painting was donated by Sunday Reed. Nolan had left the painting among many others at ''Heide''. Although Nolan once wrote to Sunday Reed to tell her to take what she wanted, he subsequently demanded all his works back. Sunday Reed returned 284 other paintings and drawings to Nolan, but she refused to give up the 27 remaining Kellys, partly because she saw the works as fundamental to the proposed [[Heide Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Burke | first = Janine | title = The Heart Garden: Sunday Reed and Heide  | publisher = [[Random House]]  | date = January 2004  | location = [[Milsons Point, New South Wales]] | isbn = 1-74051-202-2|page = 350}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, she gave them to the [[National Gallery of Australia]] in 1977 and this resolved the dispute.

In 1973, Nolan reproduced ''The Trial'' on a woven wool tapestry, which was lent to [[Admiralty House, Kirribilli|Admiralty House]] in [[Kirribilli]], the official Sydney residence of the [[Governor-General of Australia]]. The tapestry was [[Sir John Kerr]]'s favourite backdrop when making televised addresses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam, Gough]]. ''Truth of the Matter''.

"'''Toba Tek Singh'''" ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|ٹوبہ ٹیک سنگھ}}}} &lt;small&gt;[[ALA-LC]]:&lt;/small&gt; {{transl|ur|ALA-LC|''Ṭobah Țek Sin&amp;#x331;gh''}} {{IPA-ur|ʈoːbəh ʈeːk sɪŋɡʱ|IPA}}) is a [[short story]] written by [[Saadat Hasan Manto]] and published in [[1955 in literature|1955]]. It follows inmates in a [[Lahore]] asylum, some of whom are to be transferred to [[India]] following the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947. The story is a "powerful satire" on the relationship between India and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00urdu/tobateksingh/storynotes.html Toba Tek Singh - About the story - Columbia University]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The story is set two or three years after the 1947 [[Pakistan Movement|independence]], when the governments of India and Pakistan decided to exchange some Muslim, Sikh and Hindu lunatics, and revolves around Bishan Singh, a Sikh inmate of an asylum in [[Lahore]], who is from the town of [[Toba Tek Singh]]. As part of the exchange, Bishan Singh is sent under police escort to [[India]], but upon being told that his hometown Toba Tek Singh is in Pakistan, he refuses to go. The story ends with Bishan lying down in the no man's land between the two barbed wire fences: "There, behind barbed wire, was Hindustan. Here, behind the same kind of barbed wire, was Pakistan. In between, on that piece of ground that had no name, lay Toba Tek Singh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Saadat Hasan Manto |authorlink=Saadat Hasan Manto |others=Frances W.

==Bishan Singh's mutterings==
In the story, whenever Bishan Singh gets irritated he mutters or shouts a mix of [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Urdu]] and English which, though nonsensical, is indirectly pejorative of both India and Pakistan. For instance, "Upar di gur gur di annexe di bedhiyana di moong di daal of di Pakistan and Hindustan of di durr phitey mun", which means: "The inattention of the annexe of the rumbling upstairs of the [[dal]] of [[Mung bean|moong]] of the Pakistan and India of the go to bloody hell!"&lt;ref name="ref23yuyuj"&gt;{{Citation | title=Blooming through the ashes: an international anthology on violence and the human spirit | author=Clifford Chanin, Aili McConnon | publisher=Rutgers University Press, 2008 | isbn=978-0-8135-4213-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r9gQa6lo21AC | quote="Bashan Singh walked away muttering: 'Upar di gur gur di annexe di bedhiyana di mung di daal of di Pakistan and Hindustan of di dar fatay mun!'"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tobateksinghmanto115"&gt;{{Citation | title=ٹوبہ ٹیک سنگھ (Toba Tek Singh) | author=Saadat Hasan Manto | publisher=Four Corners, 2008 | isbn=978-81-907633-5-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RQJESQAACAAJ | quote="اوپردی گڑگڑدی اینکس دی بےدھیانادی منگ دی وال دی پاکستان اینڈ ھندوستان آف دی درفٹےمنھ"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
On the sixtieth anniversary of [[Pakistan Movement|independence]], the Pakistani [[Ajoka Theater|theatre group Ajoka]], as part of a series of plays and performances, performed a play adaptation in India. It was described as a "commentary on the state of affairs between the two countries, where sub-committees, committees and ministerial-level talks are the panacea for all problems".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/08/17/stories/2007081750370300.htm Beyond the shadows, Friday Review Delhi : The Hindu]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the British Broadcasting Corporation named the work among the 100 stories that shaped the world, alongside works by authors like Homer and Virginia Woolf. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180521-the-100-stories-that-shaped-the-world Stories that shaped the world Literature: The 100 stories that shaped the world]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 biographical film [[Manto (2018 film)|Manto]] featured the popular rant of the main protagonist in Toba Tek Singh. It is one of the five short stories by Manto that are featured in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-look-who-s-playing-nawazuddin-siddiqui-s-friend-in-manto-2334317|title=Look who's playing Nawazuddin Siddiqui's friend in Manto|work=[[DNA]]|date=25 February 2017|accessdate= 12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trinity Square Video''' (TSV) is an artist-run centre in Toronto, Canada. It is known for supporting the production and exhibition of video-based work. It was founded in 1971.

==History==
Trinity Square Video was founded by artists for the purpose of making video equipment easily accessible during the 1970s, a time when basic equipment was prohibitively expensive for independent artists. Artists who have created work at or with the assistance of Trintity Square Video include: [[John Greyson]], [[Lisa Steele]], [[Ed Sinclair]], [[Michael Balser]], [[Kim Tomczak]], [[Vera Frenkel]] and [[Barbara Sternberg]].&lt;ref name="Prefix_Kingstone"&gt;{{cite web|title=When It Comes To Making Art, Peter Kingstone Takes It One A Day|url=http://www.prefix.ca/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2004_Kingstone_PressRelease.pdf|website=Prefix Photo|publisher=Prefix Photo|accessdate=11 January 2018|date=28 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Video_check_from_Airman.jpg|thumb|[[U.S. Air Force]] [[Airman]] Daniel Johnson performs a function check on his video camera before shooting.]] 
A '''videographer''' is a person who works in the field of [[videography]] and/or [[video production]], recording moving images and sound on [[video tape]], digital, or any future [[data storage medium]], disk, other electro-mechanical device.  [[News broadcasting]] relies heavily on [[live television]] where videographers engage in [[electronic news gathering]] (ENG) of [[local news]] stories.

==Overview==
On a set, in a [[television studio]], the videographer is usually a [[camera operator]] of a [[professional video camera]], sound, and lighting. As part of a typical [[electronic field production]] (EFP) [[television crew]], videographers usually work with a [[television producer]].  However, for smaller productions (e.g. corporate and [[event videography]]), a videographer often works alone with a [[single-camera setup]] or in the case of a [[multiple-camera setup]], as part of a larger [[television crew]] with [[lighting technician]], [[Grip (job)|grips]] and [[sound operator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://work.chron.com/videographer-job-description-6725.html work.chron.com, videographer]&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, videographers are distinguished from [[cinematographer]]s in that they use digital hard-drive, flash cards or tape drive video cameras vs. 70mm [[IMAX]], 35mm, 16mm or Super 8mm mechanical film cameras. Videographers manage smaller, event scale productions (commercials, documentaries, legal depositions, live events, short films, training videos, [[Wedding videography|weddings]]), differing from individualized large production team members. The advent of high definition digital video cameras, however, has blurred this distinction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://promo.unm.edu/the-internships/position-descriptions/videographer.html unm.edu,  The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, Videographer ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, it is becoming more and more common for people to talk about "filming" with a [[camcorder]] even though no "film" is involved.  Similarly, the term "taping" is often used (for lack of a better term) though no tape (or film) is involved, where live video is recorded directly to video tape, a [[direct to disk recording]] using a [[hard disk recorder]], or a [[tapeless camcorder]] using [[flash media]].

Videographers maintain and operate a variety of video camera equipment, sound recording devices, edit footage, and stay up to date with technological advances. With modern video camcorders, professional studio quality videos can be produced at low cost rivaling large studios.  Many major studios have stopped using film as a medium due to [[Linear video editing|linear-editing devices]] no longer being made and the availability for amateurs to produce acceptable videos using DSLRs ([[Digital single-lens reflex camera]]). Videographers use [[Non-linear editing system|non-linear editing]] software on home computers.

'''''What the (Bleep) Just Happened?: The Happy Warrior's Guide to the Great American Comeback''''' is a withdrawn 2012 book by [[Fox News]] contributor [[Monica Crowley]]. It was published by Broadside Books, a [[HarperCollins]] imprint. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ha|first1=Thu-hong|title=A book by Donald Trump’s pick to lead national security communications is being pulled for plagiarism|url=https://qz.com/882372/monica-crowleys-what-the-bleep-just-happened-is-being-pulled-for-plagiarism/|date=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''What the (Bleep) Just Happened?'' was a New York Times bestseller. In 2013, the book was re-released with an afterword and the title ''What the (Bleep) Just Happened... Again?: The Happy Warrior's Guide to the Great American Comeback''.

According to Crowley, the book's name came from a conversation she had with her friend about the [[Obama administration]]:

{{quote|Every day, we were getting hit with a new piece of insane, leftist social engineering or some new policy to take down American power or prestige abroad — a rapid-fire assault I call "Barack-a-mole." Our enemies were getting olive branches, our allies were getting dissed, and millions of Americans were being moved into government dependency at home. "What the (bleep) just happened?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weinstein|first1=Jamie|title=Monica Crowley: Obama an economic fascist|url=http://dailycaller.com/2012/06/20/monica-crowley-obama-an-economic-fascist/|work=The Daily Caller|date=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Kirkus Reviews]] panned the book, writing that Crowley's "vitriol corrodes any basis for rational discussion." The review suggested that readers pass on the book unless they are Fox News junkies, saying it is "just a restatement of similar xenophobic, snarkily presented sentiment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WHAT THE (BLEEP) JUST HAPPENED? by Monica Crowley |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/monica-crowley/what-the-bleep-just-happened/|work=Kirkus Reviews|date=June 19, 2012|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review by Lauren Weiner in ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' said that Crowley's arguments were overstated and employed [[doggerel]]. Weiner wrote further that after "over 300 pages of cynical quips, Nixonian realism, and declarations that 'the romanticism of the Left is over'," Crowley declared herself a "happy warrior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weiner|first1=Lauren|title=(Bleep) of Faith|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/bleep-of-faith/article/649712|work=The Weekly Standard|date=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plagiarism==
Following the announcement by the [[Donald Trump]] administration in December 2016 that Crowley would be appointed to the [[U.S. National Security Council]], reports surfaced of [[plagiarism]] in ''What the (Bleep) Just Happened?''. A January 7, 2017 report from ''[[CNNMoney|CNN Money]]'' alleged numerous instances of plagiarism in the book, including over fifty incidents of copying from published sources without giving attribution.&lt;ref name="plagiarism"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/interactive/news/kfile-trump-monica-crowley-plagiarized-multiple-sources-2012-book/|title=Trump pick Monica Crowley plagiarized multiple sources in 2012 book |newspaper=CNNMoney|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Trump transition team responded that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/monica-crowley-plagiarism-report-233314 |title=Report: Trump's NSC comms pick plagiarized tracts in 2012 book |first=Rebecca |last=Morin|work=Politico|date=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Any attempt to discredit Monica is nothing more than a politically motivated attack that seeks to distract from the real issues facing this country... HarperCollins—one of the largest and most respected publishers in the world—published her book which has become a national best-seller.}}

Two days later, on January 9, 2017, a ''[[Politico]]'' report alleged a dozen instances of plagiarism in her 2000 Ph.D. dissertation on international relations at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/monica-crowley-plagiarism-phd-dissertation-columbia-214612|title=Trump Pick Monica Crowley Plagiarized Parts of Her Ph.D. Dissertation|newspaper=Politico|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-pick-monica-crowley-plagiarized-ph-d-dissertation-too.html|title=Trump National Security Pick Monica Crowley Plagiarized Ph.D. Dissertation Too|last=Hartmann|first=Margaret|newspaper=Daily Intelligencer|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley had previously been accused of plagiarism in 1999 related to a column on [[Richard Nixon]] she wrote for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/1999/08/nixons_monica_stonewalls_about_plagiarism.html|title=Nixon's Monica Stonewalls About Plagiarism!|last=Noah|first=Timothy|date=1999-08-23|newspaper=Slate|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing "striking similarities" (according to the ''Journal'') with a piece written eleven years earlier by [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/monica-crowley-plagiarism-phd-dissertation-columbia-214612|title=Trump Pick Monica Crowley Plagiarized Parts of Her Ph.D. Dissertation|newspaper=Politico|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/09/03/specials/johnson-crowley.html|title=Media Talk; Journal Article on Nixon Conjures Deja Vu|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, HarperCollins announced that "''What the (Bleep) Just Happened?'', which has reached the end of its natural sales cycle, will no longer be offered for purchase until such time as the author has the opportunity to source and revise the material."&lt;ref name="Kaczynski"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/10/media/kfile-harper-collins-monica-crowley/|title=HarperCollins pulls Trump pick Monica Crowley's book amid plagiarism revelations|work=CNN Money|last=Kaczynski|first=Andrew|date=10 January 2017|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
