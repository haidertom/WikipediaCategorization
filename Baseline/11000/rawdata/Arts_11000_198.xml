'''''55 Short Stories from the New Yorker''''' is a [[literary]] [[anthology]] of [[short fiction]] first published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine from the years 1940 through 1949.

==Front Cover==
Although the magazine debuted in February 1925 (so that its 25th anniversary was in 1950), this 1949 book's subtitle reads, "A twenty-fifth anniversary volume of stories that have appeared in the magazine during the last decade."  As with the annual anniversary issue of the eponymous magazine, the cover depicts [[The New Yorker#Eustace Tilley|Eustace Tilley]] with his monocle, in the classic [[iconograph]].

The cover subtitles also include "1940 to 1950," but the [[copyright]] date of 1949 suggests that material from 1950, and possibly the latter part of 1949, was not included; individual years listed after "copyright" also recite each of the years in the 1940s, but not 1950.

The Third Paperback printing is bound in matte paper, and is 5.25" x 8" in size, approximately the size of a [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] in 2006.

'''BBC Radio Cymru''' is [[BBC Cymru Wales]]' [[Welsh-language]] national radio network. It broadcasts two stations throughout Wales from studios in [[Cardiff]], [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], [[Aberystwyth]] and [[Carmarthen]] on [[frequency modulation|FM]], [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]], digital TV and online. 

The main network broadcasts for {{frac|18|1|2}} hours a day from 5:30am to midnight with overnight programming carried from [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] during downtime. A second station, Radio Cymru 2, broadcasts on digital and online platforms, and provides separate breakfast programming for two hours every morning.

The managing editor of BBC Radio Cymru is Betsan Powys.

==Overview==
BBC Radio Cymru began broadcasting on the morning of Monday 3 January 1977, its first programme being an extended news bulletin presented at 6:45am by Gwyn Llewellyn and Geraint Jones. This was followed at 7am by the first edition of the breakfast magazine show ''{{lang|cy|Helo Bobol!}}'', presented by [[Hywel Gwynfryn]] with contributions from a network of local reporters in studios across Wales. The first record played on Radio Cymru was ''Ffrindiau Bore Oes'' by Hergest.

The station was the first broadcasting outlet dedicated wholly to programmes in Welsh, allowing much more airtime for such output than had previously been available on the old [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] Wales (or its predecessors the Welsh [[BBC Home Service|Home Service]] and, before that, the BBC Welsh [[BBC Regional Programme|Regional Programme]]).

At the time of the station's launch, it was the only radio service in the UK broadcasting exclusively on FM (VHF). Initially, the service was part-time and restricted to breakfast shows, extended news bulletins at breakfast, lunchtime &amp; early evening and a number of off-peak opt outs from a sustaining Radio 4 Wales feed.

In November 1979, Radio Cymru's programming was expanded to 65 hours a week, introducing mid-morning output on weekdays, along with a growing line-up of dramas, light entertainment and documentaries. The network continued to expand over the next two decades before achieving a continuous service of up to 20 hours a day.

Later developments in the 21st century saw Radio Cymru introducing a nightly youth strand, ''[[C2 (radio)|C2]]'', and regional opt-outs for South West Wales, which were axed in 2008 but later reintroduced to provide live commentary of [[Swansea City A.F.C.]] matches. The station has also been streaming online since January 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

Radio Cymru is similar in format to many "general" radio stations, with news programmes at breakfast (''{{lang|cy|Post Cyntaf}}'', 'First Post'), lunchtime (''{{lang|cy|Taro'r Post}}'' – a debate-centred programme), and [[drive-time]] (''{{lang|cy|Post Prynhawn}}'', 'Afternoon Post'); together with presenter-driven sequences mixing music with chat to invited studio guests, calls from listeners, competitions etc. Radio Cymru also produces drama, features, current affairs, youth, and sports programming. 

Over the years, it has done much to promote the language, with its sports commentators coining new terms which later became accepted by Welsh [[linguistics|linguists]]. One of its more unusual - and longest-running - programmes is ''{{lang|cy|Y Talwrn}}'', a poetry competition in which teams must come up with poetry in specific styles on specific topics.

==Listening figures==
As of March 2018, the station had 121,000 weekly listeners and a 2.9% market share.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rajar.co.uk/listening/quarterly_listening.php RAJAR]&lt;/ref&gt; An average Radio Cymru listener listened to the station for 12.4 hours each week. Radio Cymru has seen its weekly audience increase by 2,000 listeners since March 2017, where its weekly audience amounted to 119,000 listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://media.info/radio/stations/bbc-radio-cymru/listening-figures|title=BBC Radio Cymru - listening figures|website=media.info|language=en|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio Cymru 2==
On Monday 19 September 2016, BBC Cymru launched a second radio service, ''Radio Cymru Mwy'' (Radio Cymru More), as a trial pop-up station broadcasting for three months in the run-up to the station's 40th anniversary. Consisting of five hours of music-led entertainment programming each weekday, Radio Cymru Mwy was available on DAB in south east Wales and online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/bbc-radio-cymru-mwy-digital BBC Radio Cymru Mwy takes to the digital airwaves], bbc.co.uk, 2 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months after the station closed, BBC Cymru announced it would launch a permanent second station, '''Radio Cymru 2'''. The new service airs for two hours every morning on digital and online platforms, as a music and entertainment alternative to the main network. Radio Cymru's morning output on the main service consists of the breakfast news programme, ''Post Cyntaf'', and a topical magazine show presented by Aled Hughes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/bbc-to-boost-wales-national-radio-stations BBC to boost Wales' national radio stations], bbc.co.uk, 23 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

BBC Radio Cymru 2 began broadcasting at 6.30am on Monday 29 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/bbc-radio-cymru-2-2018 The countdown begins - BBC Radio Cymru 2 takes to the airwaves in January 2018], bbc.co.uk, 27 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It airs as an opt-out service from 6.30am - 8.30am on weekdays, 7-9am on Saturdays and 8-10am on Sundays. The daily breakfast show broadcasts from Cardiff (Monday - Saturday) and Bangor (Sundays) with short news bulletins on weekdays from Aberystwyth.

The '''Carrizo Christ''' is an 11th-century [[ivory carving]] and is conserved in the Museo de León, [[León (Spain)|León]] (Spain). The figure is {{convert|13|in|cm}} high. The piece came from the [[Cistercian]] monastery of Santa María de Carrizo located some 16 miles west of León.

The figure of Christ is impressive due to the size of the head and his largue eyes wide open. Hands and feet as well are conceived out of proportion to the rest of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|VV.AA.|1993|p= 114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Composition for "Jazz"'' is a Gouache on cardboard, mounted on Masonite measuring 73 x 73&amp;nbsp;cm (28 3/4 by 28 3/4 inches), inscribed to the lower right 'Albert Gleizes / 15, N.Y.'

A precursor to [[Crystal Cubism]], ''Composition for "Jazz"'' consists of broad, overlapping planes of black, white and two primary colors, yellow and red, dynamically intersecting diagonal lines coupled with circular movements. Despite its highly [[Abstract art|abstract]] nature, two figures emerge, one in the 'foreground' and one towards the upper center of the composition. The principle figure, to the left, appears to be playing a banjo. The treatment of the paint is erratic, brushstrokes rapidly applied, almost expressionistic in placement. The composition is dynamic, not in time, but in spatial elements. Details such as the banjo strings and the hand strumming them are delicately yet nervously rendered. Facial features are reduced to mere lines crossing an arc shaped head. The head of the musician on the left is poised vertiginously on top of a mans body, as if disconnected, balanced somehow in unstable equilibrium. The lines, arcs, colors, and brushstrokes are together juxtaposed seemingly at random, as if the entire composition was an improvised memory of a jazz performance.

==Background==
Around 1912 the four-string [[banjo]] and saxophones became popular in New York, with ensembles such as the [[Clef Club|Clef Club Orchestra]] playing music by black composers. They played at [[Carnegie Hall]] between 1912 and 1914.&lt;ref name="Peress"&gt;{{cite book | last = Maurice | first = Peress | authorlink = | title = Dvorak to Duke Ellington | publisher = | year = 2004 | location = | pages = 99–105 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-19-509822-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their performances generated respectability in white society.&lt;ref name="Wintz"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=NgIYlUbaoAoC&amp;pg=PA835&amp;dq=jazz+in+1912+banjos+became+popular&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwib1LfJ-pXYAhXGQSYKHaUCAWMQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=jazz%20in%201912%20banjos%20became%20popular&amp;f=false Cary D.

[[Juliette Roche|Juliette Roche Gleizes]] gave an evocative description of the couple's first night in New York City and the spectacular experience that inspired Gleizes to work on the theme of jazz. Art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]] recounts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They arrived in the late afternoon, drove to the [[Albemarle Hotel]] on Forty-fifth Street, and almost immediately set out for a long walk. After about two hours they entered a restaurant in Harlem where a black jazz group was performing with extraordinary vitality and force. It was an electrifying experience, comparable, they felt, to the discovery of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]. Within a few days Gleizes produced the present work, followed shortly afterwards by a full-scale oil entitled Jazz [''Jazz'', 1915, oil on board, 100 x 75 cm, Deroudille collection, Lyon]. In spite of its title, the Guggenheim picture may represent a slightly different response to the same experience, rather than a specific study for the Deroudille work.&lt;ref name="Guggenheim 1976" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Robbins, unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1914-15, Portrait of an Army Doctor (Portrait d'un médecin militaire), oil on canvas, 119.8 x 95.1 cm, Solomon R.

Guggenheim Museum]]. Painted at the fortress city of [[Toul]] ([[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]) while Gleizes served in the military during the First World War]]
During the months of autumn, following his demobilization in 1915, Gleizes married Juliette Roche and moved to New York. There they were met by [[Carlos Salzedo]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], and [[Jean Crotti]] (who would eventually marry [[Suzanne Duchamp]]). Marcel Duchamp had emigrated to New York several months earlier after being judged physically unfit for his service in the military. Shortly after his arrival, Gleizes, accompanied by Salzedo, frequented jazz clubs in Harlem. With all it had to offer, New York had a strong impact on the artist's production, leading to abstract works virtually free of visual subject matter.&lt;ref name="Brooke et al"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1915'', from ''Le Cubisme en majesté, Albert Gleizes'', exhibition catalogue, Musée Picasso, Barcelona; Musée des Beaux-Arts, Lyon, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gleizes had been to Paris, Bermuda and Barcelona following a short stint serving the military at the fortress city of Toul, late 1914 early 1915, prior to his arrival to New York City.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; His arrival in Paris after his self-imposed exile saw the new style already underway. Yet independently, Gleizes had been working in a similar direction as early as 1914-15: ''[[Portrait of an Army Doctor|Portrait of an Army Doctor (Portrait d'un médecin militaire)]]'', 1914-15 ([[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1445 Albert Gleizes, ''Portrait of an Army Doctor (Portrait d'un médecin militaire)'', 1914-15, oil on canvas, 119.8 x 95.1 cm, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Musician (Florent Schmitt)'', 1915 (Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1455 Albert Gleizes's, ''Musician (Florent Schmitt) (Un Musicien, Florent Schmitt)'', 1915, gouache on paper, 59.7 x 44.5 cm, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York]&lt;/ref&gt; and with a much more ambitious subject matter: ''Le Port de New York'', 1917 ([[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museothyssen.org/en/thyssen/ficha_obra/392 Albert Gleizes, 1917, ''Le Port de New York'', oil and sand on cardboard, 153 x 120 cm, Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, Madrid]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org/form-and-history/poznanski/painting-and-its-laws.html Peter Brooke, ''Painting and Its Laws'', Albert Gleizes, ''La peinture et ses lois, Ce qui devait sortir du Cubisme'', Paris 1924]&lt;/ref&gt;

As other wartime works by Gleizes, ''Portrait of an Army Doctor'' represented a break from the first phase of Cubism. These wartime works marked "the beginning of an attempt to preserve specific and individual visual characteristics while experimenting with a radically different compositional treatment in which broad planes, angled from the perimeter, meet circles." (Robbins, 1964)&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;[https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3678759W/Albert_Gleizes_1881-1953 Daniel Robbins, ''Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, a Retrospective Exhibition'', Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, 1964], no. 78, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than based on the ''analysis'' of volumetric objects, the artist strove toward ''synthesis''; something that originated in ''unity''.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''Souvenirs: le Cubisme, 1908-1914'', ''La guerre'', Cahiers Albert Gleizes, Association des Amis d'Albert Gleizes, Lyon, 1957, p. 15.

"Gleizes was tremendously impressed by New York City", writes Robbins, "but the earliest New York paintings continued without break the formal research advanced at Toul (nos. 71-75) even though the influence of new subject matter is apparent."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/publications/from-the-archives/items/view/239 Daniel Robbins, ''Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, a Retrospective Exhibition'', Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, 1964 (Guggenheim website)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

The period of profound reflection of which ''Composition pour "Jazz"'' is a precursor (''viz.'' Crystal Cubism) contributed to the constitution of a new [[mindset]]; a prerequisite for fundamental change. The ''flat surface'', wrote Gleizes in 1925, became the starting point for a revaluation of the fundamental principles of painting.&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/gltexts/epic Albert Gleizes, ''L'Epopée'', written in 1925, published in ''Le Rouge et le Noir'', 1929. First published under the title ''Kubismus'', 1928.  English translation, ''The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form'', by Peter Brooke]&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than relying on the purely intellectual, the focus now was on the immediate experience of the senses, based on the idea according to Gleizes, that form, 'changing the directions of its movement, will change its dimensions' ["La forme, modifiant ses directions, modifiait ses dimensions"], while revealing the "basic elements" of painting, the "true, solid rules—rules which could be generally applied". It was [[Jean Metzinger]] and [[Juan Gris]] who, again according to Gleizes, "did more than anyone else to fix the basic elements... the first principles of the order that was being born".&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt; "But Metzinger, clear-headed as a physicist, had already discovered those rudiments of construction without which nothing can be done."&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt; Ultimately, it was Gleizes who would take the synthetic factor furthest of all.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987"&gt;Christopher Green, ''Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916&amp;ndash;1928'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, pp. 13-47, 215&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8613">There is a large [[body of knowledge]] that [[designer]]s call upon and use during the [[design process]] to match the ever-increasing complexity of design problems.&lt;ref&gt;X.F. Zha, H. Du, Knowledge intensive collaborative design modeling and support, part I: Review, distributed models and framework, Computers in Industry 57 (2006) 39–55&lt;/ref&gt; '''Design knowledge''' can be classified into two categories:&lt;ref&gt;M. Stokes, Managing Engineering Knowledge: MOKA Methodology for Knowledge Based Engineering Applications, MOKA Consortium, London,2001.&lt;/ref&gt; '''product knowledge''' and '''design process knowledge'''.

==Product Knowledge==
'''Product knowledge''' has been fairly studied and a number of modeling techniques have been developed. Most of them are tailored to specific products or specific aspects of the design activities. For example, [[geometric modeling]] is used mainly for supporting detailed design, while [[knowledge modeling]] is working for supporting conceptual designs. Based on these techniques, a design repository project at [[NIST]] attempts to model three fundamental facets of an artifact representation:&lt;ref&gt;S. Szykman, R.D. Sriram, W. Regli, The role of knowledge in next generation product development systems, ASME Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering 1 (1) (2001) 3–11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Szykman, Architecture and implementation of a design repository system, in: Proceedings of ASME DETC2002, 2002, Paper No. DETC2002/CIE-34463.&lt;/ref&gt; the physical layout of the artifact (form), an indication of the overall effect that the artifact creates (function), and a causal account of the operation of the artifact (behavior). The recent NIST research effort towards the development of the basic foundations of the next generation of [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] systems suggested a core representation for design information called the '''NIST core product model''' (CPM) &lt;ref&gt;S.J. Fenves, A core product model for representing design information, [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]&lt;span title="Interagency Report"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; 6736, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and a set of derived models defined as extensions of the CPM (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;X.F. Zha, R.D. Sriram, Feature-based component model for design of embedded system, in: B. Gopalakrishnan (Ed.), Intelligent Systems in Design and Manufacturing, Proceedings of SPIE, vol. 5605, SPIE, Bellingham, WA, vol. V, 2004, pp. 226–237.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Sudarsan, Y.H. Han, S.C. Feng, U. Roy, F. Wang, R.D. Sriram, K. Lyons, Object-oriented representation of electro-mechanical assemblies using UML, NISTIR 7057, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;). The NIST core product model has been developed to unify and integrate product or assembly information. The CPM
provides a base-level product model that is: not tied to any vendor software; open; non-proprietary; expandable; independent of any one product development process; capable of capturing the engineering context that is most commonly shared in product development activities. The core model focuses on artifact representation including function, form, behavior, material, physical and functional decompositions, and relationships among these concepts. The [[entity-relationship]] data model influences the model heavily; accordingly, it consists of two sets of classes, called object and relationship, equivalent to the [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] class and association class, respectively.

==Design Process Knowledge==
'''Design process knowledge''' can be described in two levels: design activities and design rationale.&lt;ref&gt;X.F. Zha, R. D. Sriram, et al., Knowledge-intensive collaborative decision support for design process: hybrid decision support model and agent, Computers in Industry 59 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of representation for design rationale has been recognized but it is a more complex issue that extends beyond artifact function. The [[design structure matrix]] (DSM) has been used for modeling design process (activities) and some related research efforts have been conducted. For example, a web-based prototype system for modeling the product development process using a multi-tiered DSM is developed at MIT. However, few research endeavors have been found on design rationale.&lt;ref&gt;F. Pena-Mora, R.D. Sriram, R. Logcher, SHARED DRIMS: SHARED design recommendation and intent management system, in: Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises, IEEE Press,1993, pp. 213–221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Pena-Mora, R.D. Sriram, R. Logcher, Conflict mitigation system for collaborative engineering, AI EDAM—Special Issue of Concurrent Engineering 9 (2) (1995) 101–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation Scenarios==
In terms of representation scenarios, '''design knowledge''' can also be categorized into off-line and on-line knowledge. Design process knowledge can be categorized into ontologies.

===Off-line Knowledge===
'''Offline Knowledge''' refers to existing [[knowledge representation]], including design knowledge in handbook and design ‘‘[[know-how]]’’, etc.; the latter refers to the new design knowledge created in the course of design activities by designers themselves. For the off-line knowledge, there are two representation approaches. One is to highly abstract and categorize existing knowledge including experiences into a series of design principles, rationales and constraints. [[TRIZ]] is a good instance of this approach. The other is to represent a collection of design knowledge into a certain case for description. '''[[Case-based reasoning|Case-based]] design''' is an example of this approach.&lt;ref&gt;W.H.Wood III, A.M. Agogino, Case based conceptual design information server for concurrent engineering, Computer-Aided Design 8 (5) (1996) 361–369.&lt;/ref&gt; The key issue is on the computerization of the
design knowledge representation. For instance, researchers at the Engineering Design Centre at Lancaster University, UK established a unique knowledge representation methodology and knowledge base vocabulary based on the theory of domains, design principles and [[computer modeling]]. They developed a software tool for engineering knowledge management. The tool provides an engineering system designer with the capability to search a knowledge base of past solutions, and other known technologies to explored viable alternatives for product design.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===On-line Knowledge===
'''On-line knowledge representation''' is capturing the dynamic design knowledge in a certain format for design re-use and archive. A few research efforts have been found in this area. Blessing &lt;ref&gt;L.T.M. Blessing, A process-based approach to computer supported engineering design, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Twente, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; proposes the process-based support system (PROSUS) based on a model of the design process rather than the product. It uses a [[design matrix]] to represent the design process as a structured set of issues and activities. Together with the common product data model (CPDM), PROSUS supports the capture of all outputs of the design activity.

===Ontologies===
[[Ontology (information science)|Ontologies]] are being used for product representation (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;L. Patil, D. Dutta, R.D. Sriram, Ontology-based exchange of product data semantics, IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering 2 (3) (2005) 213–225.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Bock, X.F. Zha, Ontological product modeling for collaborative design, NIST IR, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V.C. Liang, C. Bock, X.F. Zha, Ontological modeling platform, NIST IR, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;). Research suggests that there is a need to provide computer support that will supply clear and complete design knowledge and also facilitate designer intervention and customization during the decision-making activities in the design process.&lt;ref&gt;A.M. Madni, The role of human factors in expert systems design and acceptance, Human Factors 30 (4) (1988) 395–414.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, WebCADET &lt;ref&gt;P.A. Rodgers, A.P. Huxor, N.H.M. Caldwell, Design support using distributed web-based AI tools, Research in Engineering Design 11 (1999) 31–44.&lt;/ref&gt; is a design support system that uses distributed Web-based [[AI]] tools. It uses the AI as text approach, where [[knowledge-based systems]] (KBSs) can be seen as a medium to facilitate the communication of design knowledge between designers. The system can provide support for designers when searching for design knowledge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="878">The '''Dialogue on Translation between a Lord and a Clerk''' forms the preface of [[John Trevisa]]'s 1387 translation of the ''[[Polychronicon]]'' of [[Ranulf Higden]], made for his patron, [[Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley|Lord Berkeley]]. Written in [[Middle English]], it consists of a series of arguments made by the clerk (representing Trevisa) on why books should not be translated from learned languages such as [[Latin]], each one followed by a rebuttal from the Lord (representing Lord Berkeley). The clerk eventually agrees and the dialogue concludes with a prayer for guidance in the translation.

'''''A Faust Symphony in three character pictures''''' ({{lang-de|Eine Faust-Symphonie in drei Charakterbildern}}), [[List of compositions by Franz Liszt (S.1 - S.350)|S.108]], or simply the "'''''Faust Symphony'''''", was written by Hungarian composer [[Franz Liszt]] and was inspired by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s drama, ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]''. The symphony was premiered in Weimar on September 5, 1857, for the inauguration of the [[Goethe–Schiller Monument]] there.

==Structure==
The first clue as to the work's structure is in Liszt's title: "A Faust Symphony in Three Character Sketches after Goethe: (1) Faust, (2) Gretchen, (3) Mephistopheles." Liszt does not attempt to tell the story of Goethe's drama. Rather, he creates musical portraits of the three main protagonists.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, ''New Grove 2'', 14:772–3.&lt;/ref&gt; By doing so, though this symphony is a multi-movement work and employs a [[choir|chorus]] in its final moments, Liszt adopts the same aesthetic position as in [[Symphonic Poems (Liszt)|his symphonic poems]].&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, 18:429.&lt;/ref&gt; The work is approximately seventy-five minutes in duration.

===Faust===
This large-scale movement (usually lasting around 30 minutes) is a very loose sonata-form with a short central development and a protracted recapitulation. One might say that this movement represents the very synthesis of the whole symphony, since many of its themes and motives appear throughout the score in various guises, a process of [[thematic transformation]] which Liszt mastered to the highest level during his Weimar years. The basic key of the symphony ([[C minor]]) is already rather blurred by the opening theme made up of [[augmented triad]]s and containing all twelve notes of the chromatic scale consecutively (this is the first published use of a twelve-tone row, other than a simple chromatic scale, in any music). This theme evokes the gloomy Faust, a dreamer, in everlasting search for truth and knowledge. Next follows the so-called 'Nostalgia' theme introduced by the [[oboe]]. At the end of a slow [[crescendo]], there appears a violent Allegro agitato ed appassionato theme, depicting Faust's insatiable appetite for the pleasures of life – this theme establishes a gingery [[C minor]] threatened with collapse under the weight of highly [[chromaticism|chromatic]] elements. A melody of the oboe and clarinet represents the hero's 'painful delights'. The last theme is pentatonic and resolute. From all these elements Liszt weaves a musical structure of power and grandeur, in which some critics recognise the composer's self-portrait.

===Gretchen===
This slow movement is in the key of [[A-flat major]]. Following the introduction on the [[flute]]s and [[clarinet]]s, we are given the pure [[oboe]]'s melody figurated by the [[viola]]'s tender decorations, which expresses Gretchen's virginal innocence. A dialogue between clarinet and [[violin]]s describes her naively plucking the petals of a flower, in a game of 'he loves me, he loves me not'. She is obsessed by Faust, and therefore we may hear Faust's themes being introduced progressively into the music, until his and Gretchen's themes form a passionate love duet. This draws the second movement to a peaceful and short [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]].

An alternative interpretation of the Gretchen movement is that, as [[Lawrence Kramer (musicologist)|Lawrence Kramer]] writes, "What we have been calling Gretchen's music is really Faust's."&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, 108, 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire Gretchen movement could be seen as representing her from the perspective of Faust. Consequently, the listener really learns more about Faust than about Gretchen. In Goethe's drama, she is a complex heroine. In Liszt's symphony, she is innocent and one-dimensional—a simplification that could arguably exist exclusively in Faust's imagination. The listener becomes aware of this masquerade when the "Gretchen" mask Faust is wearing slips with the appearance of the Faustian themes in bars 44 through 51 and bar 111 to the end of the movement.&lt;ref name="Shulstad, 217"&gt;Shulstad, 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mephistopheles===
Some critics suggest that, like Gretchen, Mephistopheles can be seen as an abstraction—in this case, one of the destructive aspects of Faust's character, with Faust mocking his humanity by taking on Mephistopheles' character.&lt;ref name="Shulstad, 217"/&gt; Regardless of which interpretation a listener chooses, since Mephistopheles, Satan, the Spirit of Negation, is not capable of creating his own themes, he takes all of Faust's themes from the first movement and mutilates them into ironic and diabolical distortions. Here Liszt's mastery of thematic metamorphosis shows itself in its full power – therefore we may understand this movement as a modified [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] of the first one. The music is pushed to the very verge of [[atonality]] by use of high [[chromaticism]], rhythmic leaps and fantastic scherzo-like sections. A modified version of Faust's second and third themes then creates an infernal [[fugue]]. Mephistopheles is, however, powerless when faced with Gretchen's innocence, so her theme remains intact. It even pushes the Spirit of Negation away towards the end of the work.

===Text of the revised ending===
It is here that the two versions of the ''Faust'' Symphony merit different interpretations. Liszt's original version of 1854 ended with a last fleeting reference to Gretchen and an optimistic peroration in [[C (musical note)|C major]], based on the most majestic of themes from the opening movement. Some critics suggest this conclusion remains within the persona of Faust and his imagination.&lt;ref name="Shulstad, 217"/&gt; When Liszt rethought the piece three years later, he added a 'chorus mysticus', tranquil and positive. The male chorus sings the words from Goethe's ''Faust'':
{|  
! &lt;div style='text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 6em;'&gt;Original German&lt;/div&gt;
! &lt;div style='text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 9em;'&gt;English Translation&lt;/div&gt;
|-
|  style="padding-right: 6em;" | 
:::''Alles Vergängliche &lt;!--restored capitalisation of original German test --&gt;
:::''Ist nur ein Gleichnis;''
:::''Das Unzulängliche, ''
:::''Hier wird's Ereignis;''
:::''Das Unbeschreibliche,''
:::''Hier ist es getan; ''
:::''Das Ewigweibliche''
:::''Zieht uns hinan.''
|  style="padding-left: 3em;" | 
:::Everything transitory
:::Is only an allegory;
:::What cannot be achieved, &lt;!--lit: 'The unachievable', with no sense of past tense 'could' --&gt;
:::Here it will come to pass; &lt;!--wird=werden=will (aux.)/to become ie future tense --&gt;
:::What cannot be described, &lt;!--lit: 'The indescribable' --&gt; 
:::Here it is accomplished; &lt;!-- As in line 4, G emphasises the 'es', where 'hier ist getan' would probably have sufficed--&gt;
:::The eternal feminine &lt;!-- I wish English used capitals for Very Important Ideas, but sadly it doesn't. --&gt;
:::Draws us aloft.
|}
The tenor soloist then rises above the murmur of the chorus and starts to sing the last two lines of the text, emphasizing the power of salvation through the [[eternal feminine]]. The symphony ends in a glorious blaze of the choir and orchestra, backed up by sustained chords on the organ. With this direct association to the final scene of Goethe's drama we escape Faust's imaginings and hear another voice commenting on his striving and redemption.&lt;ref&gt;Shulstad, 219.&lt;/ref&gt;
The text of the chorus is also the end of [[Gustav Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|eighth symphony]].

==Instrumentation==
The work is scored for an orchestral complement of [[piccolo]], two [[flute]]s, two [[oboe]]s, two [[clarinet]]s, two [[bassoon]]s, four [[French horn]]s, three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[cymbal]]s, [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[organ (music)|organ]], [[harp]], and [[string section|strings]].  A tenor soloist and male TTB choir are also employed.

==Overview==

===Composition===
[[Hector Berlioz]], who wrote his own version of ''Faust'' and became the eventual dedicatee of Liszt's ''Faust'' Symphony, introduced Liszt to Goethe's ''Faust'' in the 1830s through the French translation of [[Gérard de Nerval]]. Although sketches exist from the 1840s, he was hesitant about composing this work. He commented wryly to one correspondent, "The worst Jesuit is dearer to me than the whole of your Goethe."&lt;ref name=SearleOrch304&gt;Quoted in Searle, "Orchestral", 304.&lt;/ref&gt; In an 1869 letter, Liszt makes a revealing comparison between Faust and [[Manfred]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In my youth I passionately admired Manfred and valued him much more than Faust, who, between you and me, in spite of his marvellous prestige in poetry, seemed to me a decidedly [[bourgeois]] character. For that reason he becomes more varied, more complete, richer, more communicative ... (than Manfred) ... Faust's personality scatters and dissipates itself; he takes no action, lets himself be driven, hesitates, experiments, loses his way, considers, bargains, and is interested in his own little happiness. Manfred could certainly not have thought of putting up with the bad company of Mephistopheles, and if he had loved Marguerite he would have been able to kill her, but never abandon her in a cowardly manner like Faust.&lt;ref name=SearleOrch304/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite Liszt's apparent antipathy toward the character of Faust, his residency in [[Weimar]] surrounded him with Goethe and the Faust legend at practically every turn. He had barely served out his first year as Kapellmeister when Grand Duke Carl Alexander decreed that the city would celebrate the centennial of Goethe's birth on August 28, 1849. During this celebration Liszt conducted, among other things, excerpts from [[Robert Schumann]]'s ''[[Scenes from Goethe's Faust]]'' for orchestra and choir. After the centennial remembrance, he helped in the creation of a Goethe Foundation; this culminated in the publication of Liszt's brochure ''De la Fondation-Goethe à Weimar''. In the summer of 1850 Gérard de Nerval himself stayed as Liszt's guest. There was much talk about ''Faust'' and the topic would spill over into their subsequent correspondence&lt;ref name="Walker, Weimar, 327"&gt;Walker, ''Weimar'', 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance of Berlioz's ''[[La Damnation de Faust]]'' in 1852, conducted by the composer, encouraged Liszt further, though he still hesitated, writing [[Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein|Princess Carolyne von Sayn-Wittgenstein]], "Anything having to do with Goethe is dangerous for me to handle." However, the final catalyst for the symphony came in a two-month period between August and October 1854. This period coincided with a visit to Weimar by [[England|English]] [[novelist]] Mary Ann (Marian) Evans, better known by her [[pen name]] [[George Eliot]]. Her consort [[George Henry Lewes]] was gathering information for his biography of Goethe. During visits to Liszt's residence, the Altenburg, Lewes and Eliot had several discussions with both him and Princess Carolyne about Goethe and his place in German literature. Once Liszt began writing, it was all-consuming; the work was produced in a white heat of inspiration.&lt;ref name="Walker, Weimar, 327"/&gt;

The symphony was revised three years after it was completed. Additional parts for heavy brass were added, as was a ''Chorus Mysticus'' to the finale; in the latter, words from Faust Part II are sung by a male chorus and a tenor soloist to music from the middle movement. Other minor changes were made but much of the original score remained unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, ''Weimar'', 328.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, Liszt added some ten bars to the second movement.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, ''New Grove'', 11:43–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance history===
After its première under Liszt's baton in 1857, the symphony (in its revised version with final chorus and tenor solo) received a second performance under [[Hans von Bülow]] in 1861, the year the score was published. [[Richard Wagner]] witnessed the performance in Weimar: "Bülow, who had been chosen to conduct Liszt’s Faust Symphony, seemed to me the wildest of all.  His activity was extraordinary.  He had learned the entire score by heart, and gave us an unusually precise, intelligent, and spirited performance with an orchestra composed of anything but the pick of German players."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Wagner |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Wagner |title=My Life, Vol II |place=New York |others=([[Mein Leben (Wagner)|Mein Leben]]) |publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company |date=1911 |page=788 |url=https://archive.org/stream/myliferichwagner02wagnuoft#page/788/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years von Bülow was highly critical of the work: "I have given that nonsense a thorough going-over! It was indescribably painful. It's sheer rubbish, absolute non-music! I don't know which was greater, my horror or my disgust! Suffice it to say that to cleanse my palate I picked up [[List of compositions by Anton Rubinstein|Ivan the Terrible]] [by [[Anton Rubinstein]]] - it seemed like pure [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], by comparison! No, ''Faust'' is an aberration: let us drop the subject once and for all."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Birkin|2011|p=358}}, citing Hans Von Bülow: ''Briefe und Schriften'', Vol. VII.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, apart from one or two sporadic performances, the symphony was neglected for roughly 50 years. Lack of interest was so great that the orchestral parts were not published until 1874. [[Felix Weingartner]] became the work's first modern interpreter (giving a performance with the [[Berlin Staatskapelle]] in 1892){{sfn|Birkin|2011|p=358n}} but he stood practically alone in his advocacy of the score until modern times, when [[Thomas Beecham]] and [[Leonard Bernstein]], among others, began championing the piece.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, ''Weimar'', 335–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcriptions===
Liszt transcribed the complete score for two pianos, and the middle movement alone ("Gretchen") for solo piano.&lt;ref&gt;See IMSLP e.g.&lt;/ref&gt;  The transcription of 'Gretchen' was recorded by [[Leslie Howard (musician)|Leslie Howard]] as part of his set of complete recordings of Liszt's solo piano music.

Following Liszt's tradition of transcribing orchestral works such as [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s nine symphonies, the Hungarian pianist [[Ervin Nyiregyházi]] transcribed the Faust Symphony for solo piano, which he performed at a recital in [[Novato, California]] on April 30, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpBX5uR0-zo&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=28D1247A71D89E8E&amp;playnext=1&amp;index=55 Performance on Youtube]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, part of [[August Stradal]]'s solo piano arrangement of the Faust Symphony has been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC|829395697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Film Employees Federation of South India (FEFSI)''' is an Indian organisation consisting of technicians from the [[Tamil cinema|Tamil film industry]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]. A total of 22 unions belonging to different trades in the film and television industry are affiliated to the FEFSI that has around 25,000 members.

==Strikes==
===June 1997===
In June 1997, some members of the FEFSI resorted to a flash strike during the shooting of the film ''[[Raman Abdullah]]'', directed by [[Balu Mahendra]], protesting against the director engaging "outsiders". This led into a major crisis when FEFSI launched an indefinite strike, affecting other film units as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.rediff.com/news/jul/07madras.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The state government's intervened and FEFSI called off the strike after a week. However, the producers hardened their stand and insisted that they would not engage any technician or worker associated with FEFSI. They complained that the rising wages of technical staff and artistes were contributing towards the box office run of Tamil films in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.rediff.com/entertai/jun/17mad.htm&lt;/ref&gt; They demanded that workers and technicians form new organisations exclusively for the production of Tamil films, on the lines of organisations in Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. The issue escalated when the organisation's leader [[Vijayan (stunt coordinator)|Vijayan]] declined to budge from his demands and was able failed to gather support from a series of prominent actors and film director [[Bharathiraja]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indolink.com/tamil/cinema/News/97/Oct/strike.htm&lt;/ref&gt; vijayan also became the key person for the strike which led to suicide of some members and some lost their asserts due to this strike.

Films delayed included ''[[Marudhanayagam]]'', ''[[Jeans (film)|Jeans]]'', ''[[Sethu (film)|Sethu]]'' and ''[[Kadhal Rojave]]''. Producer [[K. T. Kunjumon]] said his losses amounted to {{INR}} 3 [[lakh]]s after a large set he had erected for his film ''[[Ratchagan]]'' (a replica of the massive Rajaji Hall) was destroyed in the rain. Several new Cielo cars parked near the set were also damaged, resulting in a loss of another {{INR}} 7 lakhs, he claimed.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.rediff.com/entertai/jun/30mad.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The strike lasted for over six months, delaying the production of several films before easing. In June 1998, FEFSI and the Tamil Film Producers Association (TFPA) merged and formed a new organisation called the Tamil Nadu Film Producers and Employees Federation. An agreement to this effect was signed by the representatives of the two organisations in the presence of then Chief Minister [[Muthuvel Karunanidhi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98jul06/nation.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===June 2011===
Talks between FEFSI and the Tamil Film Producers Council (TFPC) over wages and working hours became a heated matter in early 2011 and FEFSI members wanted the issue regarding increase in salary to be sorted out immediately, calling for a strike in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sify.com/movies/fefsi-to-strike-from-monday-news-tamil-lgflWVajbbi.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===February 2012===
An unofficial two-week strike was held in early February 2012, with nearly 5000 members of FEFSI engaging on a day-long hunger strike at Isai Kalaignargal Sangam in Vadapalani, demanding that the Tamil Film Producers Council (TFPC) implement the revised wages for its members. The strike was made official briefly in April 2012 but did not disrupt any big-budget film productions, and soon the problems were eased out after the intervention of the State's Labour Minister [[S. T. Chellapandian]].&lt;ref&gt;http://behindwoods.com/tamil-movies-cinema-news-10/clash-brings-kollywood-to-a-standstill-fefsi-strike-29-05-13.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moviecrow.com/News/824/fefsi-strike-fails-as-tamil-movies-carry-on&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sify.com/movies/fefsi-calls-off-strike-rumblings-in-tfpc-news-tamil-melj3Bebfgd.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===June 2013===
A clash broke out when the drivers' union learnt that one of the camera crews supposedly hired a private agency for their logistics, instead of approaching the assigned drivers and this was contrary to union expectations.&lt;ref&gt;http://behindwoods.com/tamil-movies-cinema-news-10/clash-brings-kollywood-to-a-standstill-fefsi-strike-29-05-13.html&lt;/ref&gt; After brief disturbances in May 2013, FEFSI announced a decision to boycott all vehicles of the drivers’ union. In June 2013, FEFSI announced that they would go an indefinite strike after it was alleged that members of the drivers union had assaulted members of the technicians union at Nerkundram Paadhai on Monday, when they were loading food into an autorickshaw for a film shoot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/unions-clash-puts-film-shoots-on-hold/article4760404.ece&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later the strike was cancelled and film shootings resumed.

As a fallout of the strike, the Tamil Nadu Chinna Thirai Producers Council president [[Raadhika]] announced that the council had decided to break away from FEFSI.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/film-technicians-union-calls-off-strike-shoots-to-resume/article4763699.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FINIDR s.r.o.''' is an [[Offset printing|offset]] and [[Offset printing|web-fed offset]]  printing house. FINIDR specializes on book-making and other printing production. FINIDR exports over 80% of its production to Western European markets, such as [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Austria]], [[England]], [[Belgium]], [[Netherlands]], and [[Scandinavia]] etc.&lt;ref name="svettisku"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Doležal | first = Ivan | publisher = svettisku.cz | title = Tiskárna FINIDR, s. r. o. | url = http://www.svettisku.cz/buxus/generate_page.php?page_id=7298 |accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of FINIDR s.r.o., has started in 1994 in the city of [[Český Těšín]] where printing has more than 200-year tradition. Printing house was originally established by three owners but since 2009 FINIDR &lt;ref&gt;https://or.justice.cz/ias/ui/rejstrik-firma.vysledky?subjektId=721886&amp;typ=PLATNY&lt;/ref&gt; is fully owned by Jaroslav Drahoš. FINIDR was built on greenfield and by the end of the first year had 22 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | publisher = iDNES.cz | title = Na zelené louce vybudoval tiskárnu, většinu produkce vyváží | url = http://ekonomika.idnes.cz/na-zelene-louce-vybudoval-tiskarnu-vetsinu-produkce-vyvazi-pl9-/ekoakcie.aspx?c=A120128_084259_ekoakcie_vem| date = 30 January 2012 | accessdate = 3 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 FINIDR bought a part of industrial complex and moved all production processes under one roof. Another milestone was the year of 2000, when FINIDR procured first printing machine, Heidelberg in B1 format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | publisher = svettisku.cz | title = Nejmodernější technologie Heidelberg v tiskárně Finidr | url = http://www.svettisku.cz/buxus/generate_page.php?page_id=2735&amp;buxus_svettisku| accessdate = 2015-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 company adopted new information system, INFOR ERP Syte Line, which enables employees to react immediately on customers’ requirements. In 2006 new follow-up production plant was built offering more than 12 000m2 of storage and production space.&lt;ref name="svettisku"/&gt;

In 2008 FINIDR was certified with [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.info.fsc.org/details.php?id=a0240000005sTwdAAE&amp;type=certificate&amp;return=certificate.php&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, FINIDR helped to establish a polygraphic program at local vocational school in Český Těšín, Albrechtova střední škola.&lt;ref name="svettisku" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.albrechtovastredni.cz/&lt;/ref&gt; FINIDR’s key employees teach at the school and students carry out their mandatory internship in FINIDR’s graphic studio, CTP, bindery etc.

Since 2011 all production processes are doubled and in-house.&lt;ref name="svettisku"/&gt; In 2011 FINIDR implemented new Code of Conduct for all its employees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32036">'''Found footage''' is a [[film genre|film subgenre]] in which all or a substantial part of the work is presented as if it were discovered [[film]] or [[Videocassette recorder|video recordings]]. The events on screen are typically seen through the camera of one or more of the characters involved, often accompanied by their [[real time (media)|real-time]], [[voice-over|off-camera commentary]]. For added [[realism (arts)|realism]], the [[cinematography]] may be done by the actors themselves as they perform, and [[shaky camera]] work and [[naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] acting are routinely employed. The footage may be presented as if it were "[[footage|raw]]" and complete or as if it had been [[film editing|edited]] into a [[narrative structure|narrative]] by those who "found" it.

The most common use of the technique is in [[horror film]]s (''e.g.'', ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'', ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'', ''[[REC (film)|[REC]]]'', ''[[Cloverfield]]''), where the footage is purported to be the only surviving record of the events, with the participants now missing or dead. It has also been used in [[science-fiction film|science-fiction]] (''e.g.'', ''[[Chronicle (film)|Chronicle]]'', ''[[Project Almanac]]'', ''[[Europa Report]]''), [[drama film|drama]] (''e.g.'', ''[[Zero Day (film)|Zero Day]]'', ''[[Exhibit A (film)|Exhibit A]]''), [[comedy film|comedy]] (''e.g.'', ''[[Project X (2012 film)|Project X]]'') and [[family film|family]] (''e.g.'', ''[[Earth to Echo]]'') films.

Although ''[[Found footage (appropriation)|found footage]]'' was originally the name of an entirely different genre, it is now frequently used to describe [[pseudo-documentary|pseudo-documentaries]] crafted with this narrative technique. The film magazine ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' has, for example, used the term "faux found-footage film" to describe the 2012 film ''[[Grave Encounters 2]]''. [[film studies|Film scholar]] [[David Bordwell]] criticizes this recent usage, arguing that it sows confusion, and instead prefers the term "discovered footage" for the narrative [[gimmick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bordwell|first=David|authorlink=David Bordwell|date=13 November 2012|url=http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/11/13/return-to-paranormalcy/|title=Return to Paranormalcy|work=davidbordwell.net|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Found-footage films typically employ one or more of four [[cinematic techniques]]—[[first-person perspective]], [[pseudo-documentary]] or [[mockumentary]], [[news]] footage, or [[surveillance footage]]—according to an analysis of 500 found-footage films conducted by Found Footage Critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Found Footage Film Genre&amp;nbsp;– Found Footage Critic|url= http://foundfootagecritic.com/found-footage-film-genre/|website= Found Footage Critic|publisher= Found Footage Critic [Michael Steinberg]|access-date= 2016-01-14|language= en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The technique has precedents in literature, particularly in the [[epistolary novel]], which typically consists of either [[letter (message)|correspondence]] or [[diary]] entries, purportedly written by a character central to the events. Like found footage, the epistolary technique has often been employed in [[horror fiction]]: both ''[[Dracula]]'' and ''[[Frankenstein]]'' are epistolary novels, as is ''[[The Call of Cthulhu]]'' by [[H. P. Lovecraft]].

[[File:Ruggero Deodato 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Italian director [[Ruggero Deodato]] revolutionized the found footage style of narrative filmmaking with his film ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'' (1980)]]
In [[filmmaking]], it dates back at least as far as 1980 with ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'' but was popularised by ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' (1999).&lt;ref name="Hitflixhist"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eggertsen|first1=Chris|title=From 'Blair Witch' to 'Project Almanac': A history of the found footage genre|url=http://www.hitfix.com/news/from-cannibal-holocaust-to-project-almanac-a-history-of-the-found-footage-genre|website=Hitflix|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing ''[[V/H/S]]'' for [[The A.V. Club]], Scott Tobia notes that  the genre "has since become to the ’00s and ’10s what [[Slasher film|slasher movies]] were to the ’80s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tobias|first1=Scott|title=V/H/S|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/vhs-86207|website=AV Club|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The format has been subsequently used in such well-known films as ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'' &lt;!--Do NOT change to 2009. Paranormal Activity was originally released in 2007.--&gt;(2007), ''[[REC (film)|REC]]'' (2007), ''[[Cloverfield]]'' (2008) and ''[[Chronicle (film)|Chronicle]]'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Editorial: An Apologist's Rant: In Defense of Found Footage|publisher=Dread Central|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/33208/editorial-an-apologist-s-rant-in-defense-of-found-footage/|accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre appeals to [[film producer|producers]] because of its lower cost, as it is believed the illusion of [[amateur film|amateur]] documentary style allows lower production values than would be accepted on a conventional film.

Writer-director [[Christopher B. Landon|Christopher Landon]], who has made several found-footage horror films, posits that the genre is likely to extend in the future outside horror.&lt;ref name="Christopher Landon interview"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Topel|first1=Fred|title=Christopher Landon interview|url=http://www.craveonline.com/culture/625449-exclusive-interview-christopher-landon-on-paranormal-activity-the-marked-ones|website=Crave|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Golden Age (fresco by Pietro da Cortona).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''The Golden Age'' by [[Pietro da Cortona]] ([[Palazzo Pitti]], [[Florence]], [[Italy]]).]]

The term '''Golden Age'''  comes from [[Greek mythology]], particularly the ''[[Works and Days]]'' of [[Hesiod]], and is part of the description of temporal decline of the state of peoples through five [[Ages of Man|Ages]], [[Gold]] being the first and the one during which the Golden Race of humanity ({{Lang-el|χρύσεον γένος}} ''chrýseon génos'')&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Hesiod]]|title=[[Works and Days]]|chapter=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; lived. Those living in the  first Age were ruled by [[Cronus|Kronos]], after the finish of the first age was the [[Silver age|Silver]], then the [[Bronze Age (mythology)|Bronze]], after this the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic]] age, with the fifth and current age being [[Iron Age (mythology)|Iron]].&lt;ref&gt; Robin Hard - [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg The Routledge Handbook of Greek Mythology: Based on H.J. Rose's "Handbook of Greek Mythology"], [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=The+Golden+age+in+Greek+mythology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3gP-h9tvTAhVLbBoKHWhQDkwQ6AEIJTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Golden%20age%20in%20Greek%20mythology&amp;f=false p.69-70], [[Psychology Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|0415186366}}, Accessed 2017-06-May&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension "Golden Age" denotes a period of primordial [[peace]], [[harmony]], [[ecological stability|stability]], and [[prosperity]]. During this age peace and harmony prevailed, people did not have to work to feed themselves, for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to a very old age with a youthful appearance, eventually dying peacefully, with spirits living on as "guardians". [[Plato]] in ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' (397 e) recounts the golden race of humans who came first. He clarifies that Hesiod did not mean literally made of gold, but good and noble.

In classical Greek mythology the Golden Age was presided over by the leading [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Cronus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Greek Myths|publisher=Penguin Books | author=Gravity, Grass|year=1960|location=London|pages=35–37|isbn=9780140171990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some version of the myth [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]] also ruled. She lived with men until the end of the Silver Age, but in the Bronze Age, when men became violent and greedy, fled to the stars, where she appears as the constellation [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]], holding the scales of Justice, or [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]].&lt;ref&gt;"Hesiod calls [Astraea] the daughter of Jove and Themis. Aratus says that she is thought to be the daughter of Astraeus and Aurora, who lived at the time of the Golden Age of men and was their leader. On account of her carefulness and fairness she was called Justice, and at that time no foreign nations were attacked in war, nor did anyone sail over the seas, but they were wont to live their lives caring for their fields. But those born after their death began to be less observant of duty and more greedy, so that Justice associated more rarely with men. Finally the disease became so extreme that it was said the Brazen Race was born; then she could not endure more, and flew away to the stars." ([[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica2.html#25 Astronomica 2]).&lt;/ref&gt;

European [[pastoral]] literary tradition often depicted nymphs and shepherds as living a life of rustic innocence and peace, set in [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]], a region of Greece that was the abode and center of worship of their tutelary deity, goat-footed [[Pan (god)|Pan]], who dwelt among them.&lt;ref&gt;Bridget Ann Henish, ''The Medieval Calendar Year'' ({{ISBN|0-271-01904-2}}), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Golden Age in Europe: Greece==
The earliest attested reference to the European myth of the [[Ages of Man]] 500 BCE–350 BCE appears in the late 6th century BCE works of the [[Greek language|Greek]] poet [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' (109–126). Hesiod, a deteriorationist, identifies the Golden Age, the [[Silver age|Silver Age]], the Bronze Age, the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]], and the [[Iron Age (mythology)|Iron Age]]. With the exception of the Heroic Age, each succeeding age was worse than the one that went before. Hesiod maintains that during the Golden Age, before the invention of the arts, the earth produced food in such abundance that there was no need for agriculture:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Men] lived like gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them; but with legs and arms never failing they made merry with feasting beyond the reach of all devils. When they died, it was as though they were overcome with sleep, and they had all good things; for the fruitful earth unforced bare them fruit abundantly and without stint. They dwelt in ease and peace.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Plato]] in his ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' referred to an age of golden men and also at some length on Ages of Man from Hesiod's ''Works and Days''. The Roman poet [[Ovid]] simplified the concept by reducing the number of Ages to four: Gold, Bronze, Silver, and Iron. Ovid's poetry, known to schoolboys from Antiquity through the Middle Ages and beyond,{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} was likely a prime source for the transmission of the myth of the Golden Age during the period when Western Europe had lost direct contact with Greek literature.

[[File:Goldenes-Zeitalter-1530-2.jpg|thumb|right|''The Golden Age'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]].]]

In Hesiod's version, the Golden Age ended when the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Prometheus]] conferred on mankind the gift of fire and all the other arts. For this, [[Zeus]] punished Prometheus by chaining him to a rock in the [[Caucasus]], where an eagle eternally ate at his liver. The gods sent the beautiful maiden [[Pandora]] to Prometheus's brother [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]]. The gods had entrusted Pandora with [[Pandora's box|a box]] that she was forbidden to open; however, her uncontrollable curiosity got the better of her and she opened the box, thereby unleashing all manner of evil into the world.

The [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic school]], a [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery cult]] that originated in [[Thrace]] and spread to Greece in the 5th century BCE, held similar beliefs about the early days of man, likewise denominating the ages with metals. In common with the many other mystery cults prevalent in the Graeco-Roman world (and their Indo-European religious antecedents), the [[world view]] of Orphism was cyclical. Initiation into its secret rites, together with ascetic practices, was supposed to guarantee the individual's soul eventual release from the grievous circle of mortality and also communion with god(s). Orphics sometimes identified the Golden Age with the era of the god [[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]], who was regent over the [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] before Cronus. In [[classical mythology]] however, the Golden Age was associated with the reign of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]. In the 5th century BCE, the philosopher [[Empedocles]], like Hesiod before him, emphasized the idea of primordial innocence and harmony in all of nature, including human society, from which he maintained there had been a steady deterioration until the present.

===Arcadia===
A tradition arose in Greece that the site of the original Golden Age had been [[Arcadia]], an impoverished rural area of Greece where the herdsmen still lived on acorns and where the goat-footed god Pan had his home among the poplars on Mount [[Maenalus]]. However, in the 3rd century BCE, the Greek poet, [[Theocritus]], writing in [[Alexandria]], set his pastoral poetry in on the lushly fertile island of Sicily, where he had been born. The protagonist of Theocritus's first [[Idyll]], the goat herder, [[Daphnis]], is taught to play the [[Syrinx]] (panpipes) by Pan himself. [[File:PanandDaphnis.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Sculpture of [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] teaching [[Daphnis]] to play the pipes; c. 100 BCE Found in [[Pompeii]].]]

==The Golden Age in Rome: Virgil and Ovid==
Writing in Latin during the turbulent period of revolutionary change at the end of the [[Roman Republic]] (roughly between 44 and 38 BCE), the poet [[Virgil]] moved the setting for his pastoral imitations of Theocritus back to an idealized Arcadia in Greece, thus initiating a rich and resonant tradition in subsequent European literature.

Virgil, moreover, introduced into his poetry the element of political allegory, which had been largely absent in Theocritus, even intimating in his fourth [[Eclogue]] that a new Golden Age of peace and justice was about to return:
&lt;poem&gt;''Ultima Cumaei venit iam carminis aetas;
''magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo:
''iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna;
''iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto.''&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;'''Translation:'''
''Now the last age by Cumae's Sibyl sung
''Has come and gone, and the majestic roll
''Of circling centuries begins anew:
''Astraea returns,
''Returns old Saturn's reign,
''With a new breed of men sent down from heaven.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Eclogues|Eclogue]] (lines [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0056&amp;layout=&amp;loc=4.1 5-8)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

Somewhat later, shortly before he wrote his epic poem the ''[[Aeneid]]'', which dealt with the establishment of Roman Imperial rule, Virgil composed his ''[[Georgics]]'' (29 BCE), modeled directly on Hesiod's ''Works and Days'' and similar Greek works. Ostensibly about agriculture, the ''Georgics'' are in fact a complex allegory about how man's alterations of nature (through works) are related to good and bad government. Although Virgil does not mention the Golden Age by name in the ''Georgics'', he does refer in them to a time of primitive communism before the reign of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], when:
&lt;poem&gt;
''Fields knew no taming hand of husbandmen
''To mark the plain or mete with boundary-line.
''Even this was impious; for the common stock
''They gathered, and the earth of her own will
''All things more freely, no man bidding, bore.''&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
''ante Iouem nulli subigebant arua coloni
''ne signare quidem aut partiri limite campum
''fas erat; in medium quaerebant, ipsaque tellus
''omnia liberius nullo poscente ferebat.'' ([http://www.theoi.com/Text/VirgilGeorgics1.html#1 ''Georgics'', Book 1: 125–28])&lt;/poem&gt;

This view, which identifies a [[State of Nature]] with the celestial harmony of which man's nature is (or should be, if properly regulated) a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], reflects the [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic cosmology]] that prevailed among literate classes of Virgil's era. It is seen again in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' (7 CE), in which the lost Golden Age is depicted as a place and time when, because nature and reason were harmoniously aligned, men were naturally good:
&lt;poem&gt;
''The Golden Age was first; when Man, yet new,
''No rule but uncorrupted Reason knew:
''And, with a native bent, did good pursue.
''Unforc'd by punishment, un-aw'd by fear.''
''His words were simple, and his soul sincere;
''Needless was written law, where none opprest:
''The law of Man was written in his breast.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/metamorphoses-book-the-first/ Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'', Book the First, eighteenth century version, "Translated into English verse under the direction of Sir Samuel Garth by [[John Dryden]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[Joseph Addison]], [[William Congreve]], and other eminent hands.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

The Graeco-Roman concept of the "natural man" delineated by Ovid and many other classical writers, was especially popular during the [[Deism|Deistically]] inclined 18th century. It is often erroneously attributed to [[Rousseau]], who did not share it.&lt;ref&gt;See A. O. Lovejoy's essay on "The Supposed Primitivism of Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality" in ''Essays in the History of Ideas'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1948, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Soft" and "hard" primitivism in Arcadia==
In his famous essay, "[[Et in Arcadia ego]]: Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition",&lt;ref&gt;"Et in Arcadia ego: Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition," in ''Meaning in the Visual Arts'' (New York: Doubleday, 1955) pp. 297–98.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erwin Panofsky]] remarks how in ancient times, "that particular not overly opulent, region of central Greece, Arcady, came to be universally accepted as an ideal realm of perfect bliss and beauty, a dream incarnate of ineffable happiness, surrounded nevertheless with a halo of 'sweetly sad' melancholy":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There had been, from the beginning of classical speculation, two contrasting opinions about the natural state of man, each of them, of course, a "Gegen-Konstruktion" to the conditions under which it was formed. One view, termed "soft" primitivism in an illuminating book by Lovejoy and Boas&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Oncken Lovejoy|A. O, Lovejoy]] and G. Boas, ''Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1935).&lt;/ref&gt; conceives of primitive life as a golden age of plenty, innocence, and happiness—in other words, as civilized life purged of its vices. The other, "hard" form of primitivism conceives of primitive life as an almost subhuman existence full of terrible hardships and devoid of all comforts—in other words, as civilized life stripped of its virtues.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Arcady, as we encounter it in all modern literature, and as we refer to it in our daily speech, falls under the heading of “soft" or golden-age primitivism. To be sure, this real Arcady was the domain of Pan, who could be heard playing the [[Syrinx (instrument)|syrinx]] on Mount [[Maenalus]]; and its inhabitants were famous for their musical accomplishments as well as for their ancient lineage, rugged virtue, and rustic hospitality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Other Golden Ages==
There are analogous concepts in the religious and philosophical traditions of the South Asian subcontinent. For example, the [[Vedas|Vedic]] or ancient [[Hindu]] culture saw history as cyclical, composed of [[yuga]]s with alternating Dark and Golden Ages. The Kali yuga (Iron Age), Dwapara yuga (Bronze Age), Treta yuga (Silver Age) and Satya yuga (Golden Age) correspond to the four Greek ages. Similar beliefs occur in the ancient [[Middle East]] and throughout the ancient world, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Heinberg (1989). ''Memories and Visions of Paradise: Exploring the Universal Myth of a Lost Golden Age'' Los Angeles, Calif.: Tarcher. 282 pp. MISBN 0-87477-515-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindu===
The Indian teachings differentiate the four world ages ([[Yugas]]) not according to metals, but according to quality with Truth being the defining feature of the Golden Age. After the world fall at the end of the fourth, worst age (the Kali yuga) named after the Messianic figure Kali, the cycle should be continued, eventually culminating in a new golden age.

The [[Krita Yuga]] also known as the Satya yuga, the First and Perfect Age, as described in the [[Mahabharata]], a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Epic poetry|epic]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Men neither bought nor sold; there were no poor and no rich; there was no need to labour, because all that men required was obtained by the power of will; the chief virtue was the abandonment of all worldly desires. The ''Krita Yuga'' was without disease; there was no lessening with the years; there was no hatred or vanity, or evil thought whatsoever; no sorrow, no fear. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Satya Yuga lasts for 1,728,000 years, Treta Yuga 1,296,000 years, Dvapara Yuga 864,000 years and Kali Yuga 432,000 years. According to the Puranas there are 71 such cycles in a life of Manu whose life duration is 306.72 million years. The reign of fourteen Manus (4.32 billion years) comprises one day (Kalpa) of Brahma.&lt;ref&gt;Matsya Purana&lt;/ref&gt;
Knowledge, meditation, and communion with Spirit hold special importance in this era. The average life expectancy of a human being in Satya Yuga is believed to be about 100,000 years. That duration of life declines in next age, Treta Yuga to 10,000 years, followed by Dvapara Yuga 1 000 years and Kali Yuga up to 100 years. During Satya Yuga, most people engage only in good, sublime deeds and mankind lives in harmony with the earth. [[Ashrams]] become devoid of wickedness and deceit. [[Natya]]m (such as [[Bharatanatyam]]), according to [[Natya Shastra]], did not exist in the Satya Yuga "because it was the time when all people were happy".

===Brahma Kumaris===
The [[Brahma Kumaris]] and [[AIVV|Prajapita Brahma Kumaris]] make reference to five yuga in a single cycle of 5,000 years in which the Golden Age, or Satya yuga, is the first and lasts for 1,250 years. Three of the remaining four; Thretha Yuga (Silver Age), Dwarpar Yuga (Copper Age) and Kali Yuga (Iron Age), also last for 1,250 years each. The fifth age, Sangum Yuga (Confluence Age), is given to the last 100 years of the fourth age and represents the period when the Iron Age is destroyed and the next Golden Age is created.&lt;ref name="4ages"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajayoga-meditation/cycle-of-time.html |title=The ages of the time cycle according to the Brahma Kumaris |archivedate=15 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215144916/http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajayoga-meditation/cycle-of-time.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;The World Drama is the story of the rise and fall of human souls during their sojourn in this world. It is about the interplay of souls, matter and God, and of the different stages through which human souls pass in five different epochs or acts of this drama.The drama begins with the Golden Age, when every soul expresses its original qualities of purity, peace, love and truth, and human relationships are marked by complete harmony. The virtuous nature of these divine beings is mirrored by nature, which is in its pristine state and serves humans with abundance. This is the time remembered as heaven or paradise by humanity.

Golden age is the time when the human beings are full of all the divine virtues and have all the seven qualities peace, purity, love, wisdom, happiness, power and bliss to the fullest. And henceforth they are called deities, that we remember them as were our ancestors and whose divinity is worshiped in Hindu temples. The silver age comes after golden age where as time goes by, the souls, who are the actors in this drama, undergo a gradual decline. By Act Two, the number of souls has increased significantly, and though all are still happy and prosperous, the radiance and fullness that characterized their lives is no more.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajyoga-meditation/the-world-drama/|title=The World Drama - Brahma Kumaris® Int'l HQ {{!}} Godly University For Free RajYoga Meditation|work=Brahma Kumaris® Int'l HQ {{!}} Godly University For Free RajYoga Meditation|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rajayoga Mediation taught at the Brahma Kumaris are the way to revive the seven qualities within and awaken self true divinity, the souls of Satyuga AKA Golden Age has.

Meditation energizes your awareness, bringing both peace and wisdom to a busy mind. It expands one’s capacity to love, and heals broken hearts. It also dissolves many fears, replacing them with lightness and freedom from anxiety.

But perhaps the greatest gift that meditation brings is the glow of inner peace that is both gentle and strong.

Practice of Rajyoga meditation or intellectual communion with God brings into the soul many powers. Of these, eight are important.[http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajyoga-meditation/benefits-of-meditation/ The Eight Powers.]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Norse===
The [[Old Norse]] word ''gullaldr'' (literally "Golden Age") was used in [[Völuspá]] to describe the period after [[Ragnarök]], where the surviving gods and their progeny build the city [[Gimlé]] on the ruins of [[Asgard]]. In this period, [[Baldr]] reigns.

===Bible===
There is a reference to a succession of kingdoms in [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]]'s dream in [[Daniel 2]], in decreasing order identified as gold, silver, bronze, iron and finally mixed iron and clay.

{{quote|31 "Your Majesty looked, and there before you stood a large statue – an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. 32 The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, 33 its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. 34 While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. 35 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=daniel+2%3A+31-35&amp;version=NIV|title=Daniel 2: 31-35|publisher=Zondervon|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Daniel 2: 31-35}}

The interpretation of the dream follows in verses 36–45.

===Fantasy===
In modern [[fantasy world]]s, whose background and setting sometimes draw heavily on real-world myths, similar or compatible concepts of a Golden Age exist in the said world's prehistory; when deities or [[Elves in fantasy fiction and games|elf]]-like creatures existed, before the coming of [[human]]s.

For example, in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], a Golden Age exists in [[Middle-earth]] legendarium. [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] (the part of the world where ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' is set), was designed to be symmetrical and perfect. After the wars of the Gods, Arda lost its perfect shape (known as [[Arda Unmarred]]) and was called [[Arda Marred]]. Another kind of 'Golden Age' follows later, after the Elves awoke; the [[Eldar (Middle-earth)|Eldar]] stay on [[Valinor]], live with the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] and advance in arts and knowledge, until the rebellion and the fall of the [[Noldor]], reminiscent of the Fall of Man. Eventually, after the [[Dagor Dagorath|end of the world]], the [[Silmaril]]li will be recovered and the light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]] rekindled. Arda will be remade again as [[Arda Healed]].

In ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' universe, the "Age of Legends" is the name given to the previous Age: In this society, channelers were common and [[Aes Sedai]] – trained channelers – were extremely powerful, able to make [[Concepts in the Wheel of Time series#Items of Power|''angreal'', ''sa'angreal'', and ''ter'angreal'']], and holding important civic positions. The Age of Legends is seen as a utopian society without war or crime, and devoted to culture and learning. Aes Sedai were frequently devoted to academic endeavours, one of which inadvertently resulted in a hole – The Bore – being drilled in the Dark One's prison. The immediate effects were not realised, but the Dark One gradually asserted power over humanity, swaying many to become his followers. This resulted in the War of Power and eventually the Breaking of the World.

Another example is in the background of the ''[[Lands of Lore]]'' classic computer game, where the history of the Lands is divided in Ages. One of them is also called the Golden Age, a time when the Lands were ruled by the 'Ancients', and there were no wars. This age ended with the 'War of the Heretics'.

The Golden Age may also refer to a state of early childhood. Herbert Spencer argued that young children progress through the cognitive stages of evolution of the human species and of human civilization, thereby linking pre-civilization and infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Education|last=Spencer|first=Herbert|publisher=|year=1861|isbn=|location=|pages=5.|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Grahame]] called his evocation of early childhood {{'}}''The Golden Age''{{'}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Golden Age|last=Grahame|first=Kenneth|publisher=The Bodley Head|year=1985|isbn=|location=UK|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J.

===Present-day usage===
{{See also|Golden age (metaphor)}}
The term "Golden Age" is at present frequently used in the context of various fields, such as the "[[Spanish Golden Age]]", "[[Dutch Golden Age]]", "[[Golden age of alpinism]]", "[[Golden Age of American animation]]", "[[Golden Age of Comics]]", "[[Golden Age of Science Fiction]]", "[[Golden Age of Television]]", "[[Golden Age of Hollywood]]", "[[Golden age of arcade video games]]", "[[Golden Age of Radio]]", "[[Golden age hip hop|Golden Age of Hip Hop]]" and even "[[Golden Age of Piracy]]" or "[[Golden Age of Porn]]". Usually, the term "Golden Age" is bestowed retroactively, when the period in question has ended and is compared with what followed in the specific field discussed.

'''''Imaginary Conversations''''' is a publication consisting of five volumes of imaginary conversations, mainly between historical people of classical Greece and Rome, composed by the English author [[Walter Savage Landor]]. Landor's fame rests on this prose. The work is of great interest as a specimen of the poetic prose full of rich imagery &amp; ornate diction as seen in De Quincey.

==Background==
The Imaginary Conversations were begun when Landor, aged 46, was living with his family in [[Florence]] during 1821 where he had rooms in the Medici Palace and later rented the Villa Castigilione. The idea of the compositions began during his childhood as he wrote later: ''"When I was younger..[a]mong the chief pleasures of my life, and among the commonest of my occupations was the bringing before me such heroes and heroines of antiquity, such poets and sages, such of the prosperous and unfortunate as most interested me … Engaging them in conversations best suited to their characters..."''.&lt;ref&gt;H Van Thal ''Landor:a biographical anthology'' (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; The unenthusiastic reception of Landor's play “Count Julian” demonstrated that Landor, while adept at dialogue, lacked the dramatic capability necessary to convert it to stage performance, and he destroyed another tragedy “Ferranti and Giulio” in frustration at his publishers. 

At Florence, Landor was corresponding with [[Robert Southey]], who had planned to write a book of "Colloquies", and they considered collaborating on a project. Landor had finished fifteen dialogues by 9 March 1822, and sent them to [[Longman]]'s company.  Longman would not publish, so by the influence of his friend Julius Hare, he managed to get an agreement with the company of Taylor &amp; Hessey to publish them. Some disputes with the publishers followed in which both Southey and [[William Wordsworth]] became involved, not without some embarrassment to Southey as one of the "Conversations" was between Southey and Porson on the merits of Wordsworth's poetry. During 1824, two volumes were published with eighteen conversations in each. The third volume of Imaginary Conversations was published by Henry Colburn during 1828 but Julius Hare was frustrated by Colburn’s delays, and the fourth and fifth volumes were finally published by James Duncan during 1829. Over the succeeding years Landor published occasional Imaginary Conversations as individual publications and collated a number of them during 1853.

==Selected conversations==

==[[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s Appraisal==
{{cquote|The very finest flower of his dialogues is probably to be found in the single volume  ''Imaginary Conversations of Greeks and Romans''; his command of passion and pathos may be tested by its success in the distilled and concentrated tragedy of ''Tiberius and Vipsania'', where for once he shows a quality more proper to romantic than classical imagination: the subtle and sublime and terrible power to enter the dark vestibule of distraction, to throw the whole force of his fancy, the whole fire of his spirit, into the shadowing passion (as Shakespeare calls it) of gradually imminent insanity. Yet, if this and all other studies from ancient history or legend could be subtracted from the volume of his work, enough would be left whereon to rest the foundation of a fame which time could not sensibly impair.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica 1882&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Interliterary mentions==
''Imaginary Conversations'' was a favorite book of the character ''Tibby'' in E.M. Forster's 1910 novel, ''[[Howards End]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, E.M. ''Howards End''. Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 11, {{ISBN|978-0-679-40668-6}} (US)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mentioned in the book and film &lt;i&gt;84 Charing Cross Road&lt;/i&gt; by Helene Hanff.

In "The Gay Science", Nietzsche praises Landor as a 'master of prose' for "Imaginary Conversations".

#''Dialogues of famous women, and miscellaneous dialogues
#''Miscellaneous dialogues (concluded)

The '''International Association of Art Critics''' (''Association Internationale des Critiques d’Art'', ''AICA'') was founded in 1950 to revitalize critical discourse, which suffered under [[Fascism]] during [[World War II]]. Affiliated with [[UNESCO]] AICA was admitted to the rank of [[non-governmental organization]] in 1951.

The main [[goal|objectives]] of AICA are:
* to promote the critical disciplines in the field of [[visual art]]s

'''International Foundation for Art Research''' (IFAR) is a non-profit organization which was established to channel and coordinate scholarly and technical information about works of art. IFAR provides an administrative and legal framework within which experts can express their objective opinions.  This data is made available to individuals, associations and government agencies.

* IFAR functions as a step towards more regularized attribution protocols in which the question is not the importance of the attribution but the correctness of it.&lt;ref name="glueck"&gt;Glueck, Grace. [https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/08/archives/art-group-is-set-up-to-judge-attribution.html?sq=international%2520foundatin%2520for%2520art%2520research&amp;scp=13&amp;st=cse   "Art Group Is Set Up To Judge Attribution,"] ''New York Times.'' May 8, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;
* IFAR is actively involved in the legal, ethical, and educational issues surrounding the ownership and theft of art.&lt;ref name="IFAR1"&gt;IFAR: [http://www.ifar.org/about.php  About IFAR, Art Theft Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
IFAR was initially conceived in New York in 1969; its first president was Houston industrialist [[John de Ménil]].&lt;ref name="glueck"/&gt;

Founding members of the privately funded foundation were:&lt;ref name="glueck"/&gt;
* [[Harry Bober]], [[New York University]], [[Institute of Fine Arts]]
* [[Jose Lopez-Rey]], NYU Institute of Fine Arts
* [[Lewis Goldenberg]], [[PaceWildenstein|Wildenstein &amp; Co]], New York
* [[Peregrine Pollen]], [[Park-Bernet Galleries]], New York
* [[John Rewald]], [[University of Chicago]]
* [[Joseph Rothman]], [[New York Attorney General]], art frauds

The first Advisory council members were:&lt;ref name="glueck"/&gt;
* [[Diego Angulo Íñiguez]], [[Prado Museum]], [[Madrid]]
* [[Francois Daulte]], [[Bibliotheque des Arts]], [[Lausanne]]
* [[Charles Durand-Ruel]], [[Durand-Ruel Galleries]], [[Paris]]
* [[Lloyd Goodrich]], [[Whitney Museum]], [[New York City]]
* [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]], [[Galerie Louise Leiris]], [[Paris]]
* [[Lawrence Majiewski]], Conservation Center, NYU Institute of Fine Arts

In 1989, IFAR had become "a very grand-sounding name for what is really just three smart, dedicated, underpaid women who are among the nation's leading experts on stolen and forged art." [[Constance Lowenthal]], Margaret I. O'Brien and Virgilia H. Pancost work in an Upper East Side office which contains 30,000 files documenting stolen art cases. The three-rooms were on the fourth floor of the [[Explorers Club]], on East 70th Street.&lt;ref&gt;Winerip, Michael. [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/12/magazine/the-ultimate-marketplace-hot-on-the-trail-of-missing-masterpieces.html?scp=8&amp;sq=international%20foundation%20for%20art%20research&amp;st=cse  "The Ultimate Marketplace; Hot on the Trail of Missing Masterpieces,"] ''New York Times.'' November 12, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Database==
IFAR compiled information about stolen art; and by 1990, IFAR was updating its catalogue of stolen art 10 times a year.&lt;ref name="yarrow"&gt;Yarrow, Andrew L. [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/20/arts/a-lucrative-crime-grows-into-a-costly-epidemic.html?scp=10&amp;sq=international%20foundatin%20for%20art%20research&amp;st=cse  "A Lucrative Crime Grows Into a Costly Epidemic,"] ''New York Times.'' March 20, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1991, IFAR helped to establish the Art Loss Register (ALR) as a commercial enterprise. IFAR managed ALR's U.S. operations through 1997. In 1998, ALR assumed full responsibility for the database although IFAR retains ownership.&lt;ref name="IFAR1"/&gt;

==Development==
In response to the growth and development of IFAR, museum officials have revised some policies based on an assumption that discussing theft would scare away potential donors.  The change from policies of secrecy to ones which emphasize openness was gradual, mirroring an expectation that publicizing theft is likely to promote recovery.&lt;ref name="yarrow"/&gt;

* '''1998''': The [[World Jewish Congress]]  established the [[Commission for Art Recovery]] (CAR) to recover art taken from Jewish collectors before and during [[World War II]].  [[Constance Lowenthal]], then executive director of the IFAR, was selected as its initial executive director.&lt;ref name=dobrzynski&gt;Dobrzynski, Judith H.

* '''1997''': The [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in Washington started the [[Holocaust Art Restitution Project]] (HARP) in order to document and publish Jewish artwork which still remains missing.

'''''It's Garry Shandling's Show''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[sitcom]] that was initially broadcast on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] from 1986 to 1990. It was created by [[Garry Shandling]] and [[Alan Zweibel]]. The series is notable for breaking the [[fourth wall]].

==Synopsis==
The 30-minute series stars [[Garry Shandling]] as, more or less, himself: A [[Neurosis|neurotic]], somewhat self-obsessed [[stand-up comedian]] who just happens to be aware he is a television sitcom character. Garry spends just as much time interacting with the studio audience as he does the regular cast members, offering up opening [[monologue]]s and show-closing summations of the episode's events (much like [[George Burns]] on ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]'').  However, on Garry's show, all the supporting characters know they are on a TV show, not just Garry; and the studio audience is often in the storyline.

At the time of the series' production, Shandling actually lived in [[Sherman Oaks, California]], just like the character on the series. His [[condominium]] on the series was styled to be just like his real-life condo, down to the room layout and the furnishings.&lt;ref&gt;DVD commentary from ''It's Garry Shandling's Show'', Season 3, Episode 46, "Garry Acts Like A Moron"&lt;/ref&gt;

Storylines were often manipulated by Shandling to create more favorable outcomes or simply to speed things along. One episode ended years later, for example. Another allowed Shandling to tell the audience that time had passed in order to console an angry neighbor whose wall he had damaged; by the time the scene transitioned, the workmen had already fixed the wall. On America's presidential election night in 1988, Showtime presented a live episode wherein Shandling brought in ''[[Soul Train]]'' host [[Don Cornelius]] to incorrectly announce that [[Michael Dukakis]] had soundly defeated [[George H. W. Bush]].

The series' [[Theme music|theme song]] was "This is the Theme to Garry's Show", sung by Los Angeles musician Bill Lynch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2007/may/04/midwest_icon_bill_lynch_discovers_how_live_music/|title=Midwest icon Bill Lynch discovers how to 'live the music' |
first=Jon |last=Niccum |date=May 4, 2007 |newspaper=[[Lawrence Journal-World]] |accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song's lyrics are self-referential, explaining how the song came to be ("Garry called me up and asked if I would write his theme song") and asking what the listener thinks of it.

Considered a critical and [[Niche market|niche]] success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.museum.tv/eotv/itsgarrysh.htm |title=Encyclopedia of Television - It's Garry Shandling's Show/The Larry Sanders Show |work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |year=2013 |accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''It's Garry Shandling's Show'' ran 72 episodes and was on the air for four seasons (1986–1990). The show was later picked up by the broadcast [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network from 1988 to 1990 as part of its Sunday night lineup with minor cuts for language and advertising breaks; Fox began airing the show from the beginning, but due to longer seasons for network shows versus [[Cable television|cable]], had caught up by the time the show left Fox in March 1990. New episodes continued for a few months thereafter on Showtime. The show introduced much of the country to Shandling and paved the way for his more successful run as Larry Sanders on [[HBO]]'s ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''.

==Cast and characters==
Throughout the series, the cast was divided into the "Starring" cast, whose names were featured in the opening credits; the "Co-Starring" cast and the "Guest Starring" cast, both of which had the actors' names featured in the end credits.

While fighting [[ovarian cancer]], [[Gilda Radner]] guest-starred as herself in the series in 1988 in what would be her final television appearance. When Shandling asked her why she had not been seen on television for a while, Radner replied, "Oh, I had cancer. What did ''you'' have?"

The '''Japan Media Arts Festival''' is an annual festival held since 1997 by [[Japan]]'s [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]]. The festival begins with an open competition and culminates with the awarding of several prizes and an exhibition.&lt;ref name="OtmazginBen-Ari2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nissim Otmazgin|author2=Eyal Ben-Ari|title=Popular Culture and the State in East and Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsKoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93|date=March 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-62295-3|pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cipriani2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerald Cipriani|title=Culture and Dialogue Vol.3, No. 2 (2013) Issue on "Identity and Dialogue"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t50xBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|date=2 May 2014|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-5998-1|pages=8–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiner2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert G.

Based on judging by a jury of artistic peers, awards are given in four categories: Art (formerly called Non-Interactive Digital Art), Entertainment (formerly called Interactive Art; including [[video games]] and [[websites]]), [[Animation]]&lt;!--note: not anime, as foreign animated films sometimes receive awards--&gt;, and [[Manga]]. Within each category, one Grand Prize, four Excellence Prizes, and (since 2002) one Encouragement Prize are awarded.

The '''Jerusalem Center for the Visual Arts''' (JCVA) is an international [[artists-in-residence]] program that hosts artists and curators in [[Israel]].

JCVA promotes cross-cultural dialogue between visiting artists and curators and their Israeli counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcah.us/exhibitions/resources Pew Center for Arts and Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt; It provides a platform for interaction with local artists, curators and art academies, as well as links to museums and general audiences. Visiting artists are invited to work, explore, inspire and be inspired by interactions with people and places. During their residency, the JCVA provides exposure of the artists and curators to the local public by organizing from time to time, exhibitions, screenings and lectures about their oeuvre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcva.org/about.asp JCVA website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Until 2004, resident artists stayed at the Mount Zion Artists' Residence, in a historic building known as the Rose House on [[Mount Zion]]. Today participants are hosted at the [[Mishkenot Sha'ananim]] Cultural Center &amp; Guest House in [[Yemin Moshe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://81.218.229.126/culture/art/rose-house-jerusalem-center-for-visual-arts.aspx Rose House Jerusalem Center for Visual Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; and in Tel Aviv. Over the years, JCVA has collaborated with the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]],  Herzliya Museum of Art, the Israeli Center for Digital Art in [[Holon]], the Center for Contemporary Art, [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]] and [[Beit Berl College]]'s [[HaMidrasha – Faculty of the Arts]].

==JCVA residency==
The JCVA residency provides an opportunity for interaction with the local art community, museums and audiences. The program is designed specially for each guest by JCVA's art director. The residency is by invitation only. The program, established in 1987 by philanthropist Francis K. Lloyd, was directed in its early years by curator Yona Fischer. Since 2002, [[Nirith Nelson]] has served as art director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcva.org/about.asp JCVA website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Past participants in the program include [[Sophie Calle]], [[Daniel Buren]], [[Haim Steinbach]], [[Guenther Uecker]], [[Krzysztof Wodiczko]] (2004), [[Monika Sosnowska]] (2008), [[Wilhelm Sasnal]] (2009), [[Raqs Media Collective]] (2011), [[Joe Kubert]] (2011) and [[Harun Farocki]] (2012).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcah.us/exhibitions/resources Pew Center for Arts and Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;

During her residency in 2002, [[Yael Bartana]] created her Kings of the Hill video, later purchased for the permanent collection of the [[Tate Modern]] in London &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/bartana-kings-of-the-hill-t11804 Bartana: Kings of the Hill]&lt;/ref&gt; and also for the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in NY.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A34409&amp;page_number=1&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 Bartana: Kings of the Hill]&lt;/ref&gt;

During her residency in 2007, [[Anila Rubiku]], who often works with local embroiderers on her complex Urban Pornitecture, was introduced to a group of traditional [[Ethiopian Jew]]ish craftswomen. Their embroidery was incorporated in Rubiku's solo exhibition "The 16 Ways" at the Braverman Gallery in Tel Aviv in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bravermangallery.com/exhibitions/the-16-ways/# Rubiku: The 16 Ways]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monika Sosnowska]]'s work, “Stairway” 2010, was created in the wake of her residency in Tel Aviv in 2008. It was exhibited two years later at the Herzliya Museum for Contemporary Art.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.herzliyamuseum.co.il/english/september2010/sep-10-monika/monika-sosnowska Sosnowska: Stairway&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://polishinstitute.org.il/en/archive/details/162-msosnowska.html?pop=1&amp;tmpl=component Sosnowska: Stairway]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mouse.co.il/CM.articles_item,1023,209,54378,.aspx Sosnowska: Stairway]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Harun Farocki]] and Antje Ehmann conducted a workshop, “Labour in a Single Shot,” at HaMidrasha School of Art as part of a 15-city project in which students were asked to present 2-minute films on the subject of labour. The results were presented at the Tel Aviv Museum along with some of Farocki's most important works, which were exhibited in Israel for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamuseum.org.il/about-the-exhibition/labour-in-a-single-shot Farocki and Ehmann: Labour in a Single Shot]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jewish Impact Films''' is a fellowship of young [[Jewish]] filmmakers, established in 2004 by leading [[Hollywood]] producers to empower young [[Jew]]s to use creative media, specifically short [[internet]]-based films, to effectively communicate new messaging about [[Judaism]] and [[Israel]].

Senior members of the program include [[David Sacks]], Jason Venokur, Rabbi Yaacov Deyo, [[Brian Ash]], [[David N. Weiss]], Michael Borkow and [[Daniel Kaufman (director)]].

A typical JIF program teams 15 young Jews with a volunteer staff of industry professionals to create 30 short films over the course of a few weeks. The first two fellowships took place in [[Los Angeles]] during the summers of 2004 and 2005. The two more recent programs took place in [[Jerusalem]] in winter 2006 and summer 2006.

In addition to showcasing short films, the site was a gateway to more information about the subjects discussed in the films.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17037">A number of video games were selected by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], located in [[New York City]], as part of its permanent collection. These games were chosen by the Museum of Modern Art in order to showcase design elements within them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ted.com/talks/paola_antonelli_why_i_brought_pacman_to_moma?language=en |last1= Antonelli|first1=Paola|author-link=Paola Antonelli|title=Why I brought Pac-Man to MoMA |date=May 2013 |publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]] |accessdate=2014-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen initial games were announced in November 2012, with plans to expand the collection to up to forty games over time, as the museum is able to acquire the display rights for them. Six more games were added to the collection in June 2013, as well a [[home video game console|game console]].

Curated by [[Paola Antonelli]], the collection was included in the exhibition ''Applied Design''  in the [[List of works in the Museum of Modern Art#Department of Architecture and Design|Philip Johnson Architecture and Design Galleries]]. In these galleries, around a hundred objects that represent contemporary design were displayed. Most games in the collection are playable on some level and all are displayed in a manner to minimize the influence of [[nostalgia]].&lt;ref name="PCMag"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2416148,00.asp |title=MoMA Exhibit Showcases Video Games as Modern Art |publisher=''[[PC Magazine]]'' |last=Milot |first=Stephanie |date=2013-03-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908155956/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0%2C2817%2C2416148%2C00.asp |archive-date=2015-09-08 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Pac-Man in the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA).png|thumb|right|alt=A screen on a plain gray wall displaying Pac-Man, with a simple joystick and pair of headphones beneath it|''[[Pac-Man]]'' is placed near the elevator exit, as it was assumed to be one of the most popular games on display.&lt;ref name="Mashable Inside"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2013/03/01/moma-video-games-exhibit-pics/#_|title=Inside MoMA's Classic Video Games Exhibit|publisher=''[[Mashable]]''|last=Indvik|first=Lauren|date=2013-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908160222/http://mashable.com/2013/03/01/moma-video-games-exhibit-pics/|archive-date=2015-09-08|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The exhibition stirred up controversy, as video games are [[Video games as an art form|not commonly considered art]] among critics and therefore might not have a place in an art gallery.&lt;ref name="not art"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/nov/30/moma-video-games-art|title=Sorry MoMA, video games are not art|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|last=Jones|first=Jonathan|author-link=Jonathan Jones (journalist)|date=2012-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908160418/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/nov/30/moma-video-games-art|archive-date=2015-09-08|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the collection is modeled after [[Philip Johnson]]’s 1934 exhibition "[[Machine Art]]," in which pieces of machinery such as propeller blades were displayed in a minimalist fashion to lay focus on their [[Mechanical system|mechanical design]]. This set-up would create a "strange distance, this shock, that made people realize how gorgeous formally, and also important functionally, design pieces were," which, according to the exhibit's curator Paola Antonelli, is the desired effect of the exhibition.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/05/moma-video-games/|title=‘All Hell Broke Loose': Why MoMA Is Exhibiting ''Tetris'' and ''Pac-Man''|publisher=''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]''|last=Moore|first=Bo|date=2013-05-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908160501/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/mar/01/video-games-art-moma-exhibition|archive-date=2015-09-08|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to minimize factors such as nostalgia, the games are displayed in a minimalist fashion where only a screen and controlling-device are visible on an otherwise blank wall.&lt;ref name="PCMag" /&gt;

At least one other video game, namely ''[[Katamari Damacy]]'', has been displayed in MoMA's design galleries before.&lt;ref name="Katamari Damacy" /&gt; The exhibition is part of a movement to include forms beyond traditional media that the Museum of Modern Art began in 2006, starting with [[Typeface|digital font]]s and later moving on to video games. MoMA has taken cautious care of traffic flow, as this had proved to be an "interesting" challenge. Games that are likely to be heavily played, such as ''Pac-Man'', have been placed near entrances and exits to assure a constant flow from these games, while games that would require a larger amount of time to play have had a [[game demo|demo version]] developed for them, so that visitors can beat those and move on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2013/02/27/moma-video-games-exhibit/|title=MoMA Exhibit to Feature 'Pac-Man' and 13 Other Video Game Classics|publisher=''Mashable''|last=Indvik|first=Lauren|date=2013-02-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908160552/http://mashable.com/2013/02/27/moma-video-games-exhibit/|archive-date=2015-09-08|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the MoMA is mainly interested in acquiring a game's hardware and interface, the [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[source code]] is considered the most valued. According to Antonelli, "when we cannot acquire the code, we acquire simulations, emulations, the cartridge, the hardware. But what we're interested in showing is the interaction by itself."&lt;ref name="interview1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2014-12-15/museum-modern-art-embraces-all-aspects-digital-culture-and-design|title=The Museum of Modern Art embraces all aspects of digital culture and design|publisher=''[[Public Radio International]]''|last=Wernick|first=Adam|date=2014-12-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911060510/http://www.pri.org/stories/2014-12-15/museum-modern-art-embraces-all-aspects-digital-culture-and-design|archive-date=2015-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection leans towards the [[Golden age of arcade video games|classic era]] of [[Arcade game|arcade machine]]s and [[8-bit era|8-bit consoles]] as, during this era, "a small number of visionaries laid the groundwork for where we are now." According to Paul Galloway, many early, "seemingly simple games remain as vital and compelling today as they were" during the 1970s and 80s. [[Ralph H. Baer]]'s [[Magnavox Odyssey]] console was added as it was considered both "a masterpiece of engineering and industrial design" as well as highly important during the birth of the [[video game industry|industry]].&lt;ref name="Magnavox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/28/4475548/moma-adds-magnavox-odyssey-and-six-classics-to-game-design-exhibit|title=MoMA adds Magnavox Odyssey and six classics to game design exhibit|publisher=''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''|last=Campbell|first=Colin|date=2013-06-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908160748/http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/28/4475548/moma-adds-magnavox-odyssey-and-six-classics-to-game-design-exhibit|archive-date=2015-09-08|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lunar Park''''' is a mock [[memoir]] by American writer  [[Bret Easton Ellis]]. It was released by [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]] in 2005. It was the first book written by Ellis to use [[past tense]] [[narrative]].&lt;ref name=bookclub/&gt; The title bears no relation to the public amusement locations known as Luna Park.

==Plot summary==
The novel begins with an inflated and parodic but reasonably accurate portrayal of Ellis's early fame. It details incidents of his rampant drug use and his publicly humiliating book tours to promote ''[[Glamorama]]''. The novel dissolves into fiction as Ellis describes a liaison with an actress named Jayne Dennis, whom he later marries, and with whom he conceives a child. From this point, the fictional Ellis' life reflects the real writer's only in some descriptions of the past and possibly in his general sentiments.

Ellis and Jayne move to fictional Midland, an affluent suburban town outside New York City, which they no longer consider safe due to pervasive terrorist acts in a post-9/11 America.  Fictional incidents include suicide bombings in [[Wal-Mart]]s and a [[dirty bomb]] detonated in [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/050816-lunarpark/|first=Jeff|last=Gomez|title=Dark Side of the Moon|date=16 August 2005|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Ellis-writes-himself-into-suburbs-2647761.php|first=Christine|last=Thomas|title=Ellis writes himself into suburbs|date=14 August 2005|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Strange incidents start happening on a Halloween night, some involving a Terby doll belonging to Ellis's fictional stepdaughter Sarah.

As the novel progresses, the haunting of Ellis's house and questions over the death of his father become increasingly prominent. With his history of drug use and alcoholism, his wife, children and housekeeper are understandably skeptical of his claims that the house is haunted. Unfolding events only very gradually reveal a much more complicated situation than a simple haunting. There is a dynamic interplay between the author's dead father, the house itself and specific negative associations buried within the author's own subconscious mind. Added to all of this is the very late-breaking and almost gratuitous insinuation that Robby, the narrator's young son, may somehow be at the epicenter of all these events.

== Characters ==
Several of the characters are fictionalized portrayals of real people. Most notable among these is Ellis himself, but others include friend and fellow author [[Jay McInerney]] and Ellis's late father.

* Bret Easton Ellis - Novelist who rose to fame while still at college with his debut novel ''[[Less Than Zero (novel)|Less Than Zero]]''; now lives in the suburbs with old flame Jayne Dennis. There are considerable differences between this Ellis and the author himself, although there are also crucial similarities. The fictional Bret attended [[Camden College (fictional college)|Camden College]], the fictional [[liberal arts college]] which recurs in his novels.
* Jayne Dennis - Fictional film star, married to Bret Easton Ellis. Said to have dated many men, including [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]] and [[Keanu Reeves]] amongst others. As part of the marketing campaign a website was created, www.jaynedennis.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jayne Dennis|url=http://www.jaynedennis.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625011422/http://www.jaynedennis.com/|archivedate=25 June 2010|accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of doctored images and a fictional filmography. Some of the pictures of Dennis on the stills page are of actress [[Cynthia Gibb]]. It is noted in a disclaimer on the stills page that the site is a work of fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Is Jayne Dennis?|url=http://www.jaynedennis.com/credit.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525083422/http://www.jaynedennis.com/credit.html|archivedate=25 May 2010|accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Robby - Bret and Jayne's eleven-year-old son.
* Sarah - Jayne's six-year-old daughter and Bret's stepdaughter.
* Robert Ellis - Bret's father, deceased.
* [[Patrick Bateman]] - Serial killer from ''[[American Psycho]]''. Rumored to be responsible for murders in the local suburbia.
* Donald Kimball - Detective from ''American Psycho''. Questions Ellis about the aforementioned Bateman-inspired murders. Kimball appears to be an example of Bret's fictional world crossing over with his "real" world, one which Bret does not pick up on. Later, Bret discovers the name to be an alias.
* Mitchell Allen - Mitchell Allen is Bret's neighbour, and is a minor character from ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]''. Bret remembers going to college with him at Camden, and even remembers details of Mitchell's alleged affair with fictional character Paul Denton. The narrator doesn't seem aware of this crossover between fiction and reality. The author has commented that he is "not quite sure how [Mitchell] ended up on Elsinore Lane or why I put him there" but also adds that "maybe I found Mitchell Allen pretty amusing in ''The Rules of Attraction'' and as a private joke that would only mean something to me decided to place him next door to the narrator of ''Lunar Park.''"&lt;ref name=RandomQ&amp;A&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780375412912&amp;view=qa|title=A Conversation with Bret Easton Ellis|accessdate=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Introducing the character allowed Ellis to "riff on Camden College... and men of a certain age."&lt;ref name=bookclub&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2010/jul/26/bret-easton-ellis-guardian-book-club|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Guardian book club: John Mullan meets Bret Easton Ellis|accessdate=2010-08-14|date=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clayton - College student who Bret notices strikingly resembles Patrick Bateman, a young Bret, and in name resembles Clay from ''Less Than Zero''.
* Aimee Light - A graduate student writing her thesis on Bret.
* [[Jay McInerney]] - Easton's contemporary and friend; author of ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (novel)|Bright Lights, Big City]]''

==Development==
Ellis finished writing the novel in the summer of 2004.&lt;ref name="scifi"&gt;{{cite news |title = Lunar Exorcises Ellis' Ghosts |first = John Joseph |last = Adams |authorlink=John Joseph Adams |url = http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&amp;id=37989 |work = [[Syfy|SCI FI Wire]] |date = 14 September 2006 |accessdate = 2013-08-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080207023448/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&amp;id=37989 |archivedate = 7 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis said the book was an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to [[Stephen King]] and the comic books he loved as a child.&lt;ref name="scifi" /&gt;

Ellis told the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'' that the Terby "is based on a [[Furby]] but also there was this bird-like doll that my older sister had and I wrote a short story about it when I was 7 or 8. She used to scare me with it, I'd go to my bedroom and get into bed and it'd be there, she'd hide it there just to scare me. Or I'd be walking up the stairs and she'd chase me with it. And I think that's what I was channelling and it fitted in to all the other things that I was haunted by.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/arts/literature/s/177/177300_behind_brets_mask.html|title=Behind Bret's mask|date=10 October 2005|publisher=[[Manchester Evening News]]|accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revelation that 'Terby' is in fact 'Y Bret' (Why, Bret?) spelt backwards is an homage to the "redrum" (murder spelt backwards) plot device in King's ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabotagetimes.com/people/patrick-bateman-was-me/ |title=The great Bret Easton Ellis on sex, drugs, being gay, clothes, skin disease, the casting couch, American Psycho and his new book Imperial Bedrooms. |accessdate=January 31, 2011 |date=January 31, 2011 |work=Sabotage Times |last=Brown |first=James |authorlink=James Brown (editor) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414191008/http://www.sabotagetimes.com/people/patrick-bateman-was-me/ |archivedate=April 14, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Kracht|Kracht, C.]], &amp; [[David Woodard|Woodard, D.]], [http://www.wehrhahn-verlag.de/index.php?section=abisz&amp;subsection=details&amp;id=577 ''Five Years, Vol. 1''] ([[Hannover]]: [[:de:Wehrhahn Verlag|Wehrhahn Verlag]], 2011), pp. 140, 188, 192, 196, 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Léon Mignon''' ([[Liège]], 9 April 1847 – [[Schaerbeek]], 30 September 1898) was a Belgian sculptor working in a [[Realism (arts)|realist]] idiom, known for his depiction of [[bull]]s.

Born at Liège, Léon Mignon completed his studies at the Académie royale des Beaux-Arts de Liège in 1871. He made his first showing at the Salon of Ghent, and obtained a fellowship from the Fondation Darchis for further study in Italy.

He set up his studio in [[Paris]] in 1876 in collaboration with [[Paul de Vigne]], then settled permanently at [[Schaerbeek]]. He won a gold medal at the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] for his sculpture ''Li Tore'', the Bull-Tamer (''illustration'') which provoked polemics from critics for its combination of nudity with forthright realism.

''Li Tore'', set up at Liège, became the mascot of the students, who hid it in the cellars of the Académie  to protect it during [[World War II]]. The bull has become an [[emblem]] for all Liège, with the city motto ''"Liège, forcer l’avenir!"'', "Liège, make the future happen!"

A bronze on a similar theme, his ''Le Dompteur de Taureaux'' (1881), which had been noticed at the retrospective exhibition of Belgian sculpture the previous year (in its plaster model), and was championed by Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns, Minister of the Interior, stands on the Terrasses d'Avroy, Liège. Though a scarf had been added to the model to disguise the figure's nudity, the sculpture scandalised the editors of the Catholic daily, ''La Gazette de Liège.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wittert.ulg.ac.be/expo/19e/album/173_mignon_tore.html Vers la modernité. Le XIXe siècle au Pays de Liège].&lt;/ref&gt;

One among his ''[[animalier]]'' sculptures is to be seen at the [[Botanical Garden of Brussels]]: ''The Olive Tree, or Peace'', representing an agricultural worker with his ox. His early ''Combat de taureaux dans la campagne romaine'' is conserved in the Musée Royal des Beaux-Arts, Brussels.

Other sculptures include ''Hide-and-Seek'' and ''Lady Godiva''.

Both Schaerbeek and Liège possess a rue Léon Mignon.

'''Mannerism''', also known as '''Late Renaissance''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=IFMohetegAcC&amp;pg=PT330&amp;dq=mannerism+late+renaissance&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR39KL6P_XAhVXOMAKHTUJAc0Q6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=mannerism%20late%20renaissance&amp;f=false A World history of architecture] and [https://books.google.it/books?id=nHzqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=mannerism+late+renaissance&amp;dq=mannerism+late+renaissance&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR39KL6P_XAhVXOMAKHTUJAc0Q6AEIJDAA Mannerism: the painting and style of the Late Renaissance]&lt;/ref&gt; is a style in [[European art]] that emerged in the later years of the Italian [[High Renaissance]] around 1520, spreading by about 1530 and lasting until about the end of the 16th century in Italy, when the [[Baroque]] style largely replaced it. [[Northern Mannerism]] continued into the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg 1971, 483.&lt;!--If this statement can be found in the third edition of 1993, it would be preferable to cite from that edition, which is cited elsewhere in this same article.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Painting style|Stylistically]], Mannerism encompasses a variety of approaches influenced by, and reacting to, the harmonious ideals associated with artists such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]], and early [[Michelangelo]]. Where High Renaissance art emphasizes proportion, balance, and ideal beauty, Mannerism exaggerates such qualities, often resulting in compositions that are asymmetrical or unnaturally elegant.&lt;ref name= "ReferenceC "&gt;Gombrich 1995, {{Page needed|date=April 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The style is notable for its intellectual sophistication as well as its artificial (as opposed to naturalistic) qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/zino/hd_zino.htm |title=Mannerism: Bronzino (1503–1572) and his Contemporaries|publisher= Metropolitan Museum of Art|date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It favors compositional tension and instability rather than the balance and clarity of earlier Renaissance painting. Mannerism in literature and music is notable for its highly florid style and intellectual sophistication.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Art and Illusion, E. H. Gombrich, {{ISBN|9780691070001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of Mannerism and the phases within it continue to be a subject of debate among art historians. For example, some scholars have applied the label to certain early modern forms of literature (especially poetry) and music of the 16th and 17th centuries. The term is also used to refer to some late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] painters working in northern Europe from about 1500 to 1530, especially the [[Antwerp Mannerism|Antwerp Mannerists]]—a group unrelated to the Italian movement. Mannerism has also been applied by analogy to the [[Classical Latin|Silver Age of Latin literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsconnected.org/resource/93691/the-mannerist-style-and-the-lamentation|title=the-mannerist-style |publisher=www.artsconnected.org|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
[[File:Laocoon Pio-Clementino Inv1059-1064-1067.jpg|thumb|230px|Mannerism role-model: ''[[Laocoön and His Sons]]'', an ancient sculpture, rediscovered in 1506; now in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. The artists of Mannerism greatly admired this piece of sculpture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;]]

The word ''mannerism'' derives from the Italian ''maniera'', meaning "style" or "manner". Like the English word "style", ''maniera'' can either indicate a specific type of style (a beautiful style, an abrasive style) or indicate an absolute that needs no qualification (someone "has style").&lt;ref&gt;
John Shearman, “Maniera as an Aesthetic Ideal”, in Cheney 2004, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second edition of his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'' (1568), [[Giorgio Vasari]] used ''maniera'' in three different contexts:  to discuss an artist's manner or method of working; to describe a personal or group style, such as the term ''maniera greca'' to refer to the Byzantine style or simply to the ''maniera'' of Michelangelo; and to affirm a positive judgment of artistic quality.&lt;ref&gt;Cheney 1997, 17.&lt;!--The pagination may be different in the 1997 edition from the 2004 one found as the main entry in the reference list. Be sure the right one is being cited. Ideally, only one edition should be cited unless there is information in the earlier missing in the later edition.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Vasari was also a Mannerist artist, and he described the period in which he worked as "la maniera moderna", or the "modern style".&lt;ref&gt;Briganti 1961, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; James V. Mirollo describes how "bella maniera" poets attempted to surpass in virtuosity the sonnets of Petrarch.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mirollo 1984, {{Page needed|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion of "bella maniera" suggests that artists who were thus inspired looked to copying and bettering their predecessors, rather than confronting nature directly. In essence, "bella maniera" utilized the best from a number of source materials, synthesizing it into something new.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

As a stylistic label, "Mannerism" is not easily defined. It was used by Swiss historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]] and popularized by German [[Art history|art historians]] in the early 20th century to categorize the seemingly uncategorizable art of the Italian 16th century — art that was no longer found to exhibit the harmonious and rational approaches associated with the High Renaissance. “High Renaissance” connoted a period distinguished by harmony, grandeur and the revival of classical antiquity. The term Mannerist was redefined in 1967 by [[John Shearman]]&lt;ref&gt;Shearman 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; following the exhibition of Mannerist paintings organised by [[Fritz Grossmann]] at [[Manchester Art Gallery|Manchester City Art Gallery]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Grossmann 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; The label “Mannerism” was used during the 16th century to comment on social behaviour and to convey a refined virtuoso quality or to signify a certain technique.
However, for later writers, such as the 17th-century Gian Pietro Bellori, "la maniera" was a derogatory term for the perceived decline of art after Raphael, especially in the 1530s and 1540s.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth 1962, 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 19th century on, art historians have commonly used the term to describe art that follows Renaissance classicism and precedes the Baroque.

Yet historians differ as to whether Mannerism is a style, a movement, or a period; and while the term remains controversial it is still commonly used to identify European art and culture of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;

==Origin and development==
[[File:Dividing water from Heaven.jpg|thumb|230px|Collected figures, ignudi, from Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling]]

By the end of the High Renaissance, young artists experienced a crisis:&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; it seemed that everything that could be achieved was already achieved. No more difficulties, technical or otherwise, remained to be solved. The detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, physiognomy and the way in which humans register emotion in expression and gesture, the innovative use of the human form in figurative composition, the use of the subtle gradation of tone, all had reached near perfection. The young artists needed to find a new goal, and they sought new approaches.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} At this point Mannerism started to emerge.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The new style developed between 1510 and 1520 either in Florence,&lt;ref name="friedlaender"&gt;Friedländer 1965,{{Page needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in Rome, or in both cities simultaneously.&lt;ref name="freedberg175"&gt;Freedberg 1993, 175–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins and role models===
This period has been described as a "natural extension"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; of the art of [[Andrea del Sarto]], Michelangelo, and Raphael. Michelangelo developed his own style at an early age, a deeply original one which was greatly admired at first, then often copied and imitated by other artists of the era.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; One of the qualities most admired by his contemporaries was his ''terribilità'', a sense of awe-inspiring grandeur, and subsequent artists attempted to imitate it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Other artists learned Michelangelo's impassioned and highly personal style by copying the works of the master, a standard way that students learned to paint and sculpt. His [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] provided examples for them to follow, in particular his representation of collected figures often called ''[[ignudi]]'' and of the [[Libyan Sibyl]], his [[vestibule (Architecture)|vestibule]] to the [[Laurentian Library]], the figures on his [[Medici]] tombs, and above all his ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|Last Judgment]]''. The later Michelangelo was one of the great role models of Mannerism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Young artists broke in to his house and stole drawings from him.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Giorgio Vasari, Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects'', Giorgio Vasari noted that Michelangelo stated once: "Those who are followers can never pass by whom they follow".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

====The competitive spirit====

The competitive spirit was cultivated by patrons who encouraged sponsored artists to emphasize virtuosic technique and to compete with one another for commissions. It drove artists to look for new approaches and dramatically illuminated scenes, elaborate clothes and compositions, elongated proportions, highly stylized poses, and a lack of clear perspective. Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were each given a commission by Gonfaloniere [[Piero Soderini]] to decorate a wall in the Hall of Five Hundred in Florence. These two artists were set to paint side by side and compete against each other, fueling the incentive to be as innovative as possible.

===Early mannerism===
[[File:Jacopo Pontormo 004.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Jacopo Pontormo]], ''Entombment'', 1528; Santa Felicità, Florence]]
The early Mannerists in Florence—especially the students of [[Andrea del Sarto]] such as [[Jacopo da Pontormo]] and [[Rosso Fiorentino]] who are notable for elongated forms, precariously balanced poses, a collapsed perspective, irrational settings, and theatrical lighting. [[Parmigianino]] (a student of [[Antonio da Correggio|Correggio]]) and [[Giulio Romano]] (Raphael’s head assistant) were moving in similarly stylized aesthetic directions in Rome.  These artists had matured under the influence of the High Renaissance, and their style has been characterized as a reaction to or exaggerated extension of it. Instead of studying nature directly, younger artists began studying Hellenistic sculpture and paintings of masters past. Therefore, this style is often identified as "anti-classical”,&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer 1965,{{Page needed|date=September 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; yet at the time it was considered a natural progression from the High Renaissance. The earliest experimental phase of Mannerism, known for its "anti-classical" forms, lasted until about 1540 or 1550.&lt;ref name="freedberg175" /&gt; Marcia B. Hall, professor of art history at Temple University, notes in her book ''After Raphael'' that Raphael's premature death marked the beginning of Mannerism in Rome.

In past analyses, it has been noted that mannerism arose in the early 16th century contemporaneously with a number of other social, scientific, religious and political movements such as the [[Heliocentrism|Copernican model]], the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]], and the [[Protestant Reformation]]'s increasing challenge to the power of the Catholic Church. Because of this, the style's elongated forms and distorted forms were once interpreted as a reaction to the idealized compositions prevalent in High Renaissance art.&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;Manfred Wundram, "Mannerism," Grove Art Online. Oxford University Press, [accessed 23 April 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation for the radical stylistic shift c. 1520 has fallen out of scholarly favor, though early Mannerist art is still sharply contrasted with High Renaissance conventions; the accessibility and balance achieved by Raphael's ''[[The School of Athens|School of Athens]]'' no longer seemed to interest young artists.

===High maniera===
The second period of Mannerism is commonly differentiated{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} from the earlier, so-called "anti-classical" phase.
Subsequent mannerists stressed intellectual conceits and artistic virtuosity, features that have led later critics to accuse them of working in an unnatural and affected "manner" (''maniera''). Maniera artists looked to their older contemporary Michelangelo as their principal model; theirs was an art imitating art, rather than an art imitating nature. Art historian [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg]] argues that the intellectualizing aspect of maniera art involves expecting its audience to notice and appreciate this visual reference—a familiar figure in an unfamiliar setting enclosed between "unseen, but felt, quotation marks".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; The height of artifice is the Maniera painter's penchant for deliberately misappropriating a quotation. [[Agnolo Bronzino]] and [[Giorgio Vasari]] exemplify this strain of Maniera that lasted from about 1530 to 1580. Based largely at courts and in intellectual circles around Europe, Maniera art couples exaggerated elegance with exquisite attention to surface and detail: porcelain-skinned figures recline in an even, tempered light, acknowledging the viewer with a cool glance, if they make eye contact at all. The Maniera subject rarely displays much emotion, and for this reason works exemplifying this trend are often called 'cold' or 'aloof.' This is typical of the so-called "stylish style" or ''Maniera'' in its maturity.&lt;ref&gt;
Shearman 1967, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread of mannerism==
[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Surrey 1546.jpg|thumb|230px|English Mannerism: [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]], 1546, a rare English Mannerist portrait by a Flemish immigrant]]

The cities Rome, Florence, and Mantua were Mannerist centers in Italy. Venetian painting pursued a different course, represented by [[Titian]] in his long career.  A number of the earliest Mannerist artists who had been working in Rome during the 1520s fled the city after the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527. As they spread out across the continent in search of employment, their style was disseminated throughout Italy and Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Briganti 1961, 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the first international artistic style since the [[Gothic art|Gothic]].&lt;ref&gt;Briganti 1961, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Other parts of Northern Europe did not have the advantage of such direct contact with Italian artists, but the Mannerist style made its presence felt through prints and illustrated books. European rulers, among others, purchased Italian works, while northern European artists continued to travel to Italy, helping to spread the Mannerist style. Individual Italian artists working in the North gave birth to a movement known as the [[Northern Mannerism]]. [[Francis I of France]], for example, was presented with [[Bronzino]]'s ''[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]''. The style waned in Italy after 1580, as a new generation of artists, including the [[Accademia degli Incamminati|Carracci]] brothers, [[Caravaggio]] and [[Cigoli]], revived naturalism. [[Walter Friedlaender]] identified this period as "anti-mannerism", just as the early mannerists were "anti-classical" in their reaction away from the aesthetic values of the High Renaissance&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer 1957, {{Page needed|date=September 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and today the Carracci brothers and Caravaggio are agreed to have begun the transition to Baroque-style painting which was dominant by 1600.

Outside of Italy, however, Mannerism continued into the 17th century. In France, where Rosso traveled to work for the court at [[School of Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]], it is known as the "[[Henry II style]]" and had a particular impact on architecture. Other important continental centers of [[Northern Mannerism]] include the court of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] in [[Prague]], as well as [[Haarlem]] and [[Antwerp]]. Mannerism as a stylistic category is less frequently applied to [[England|English]] visual and decorative arts, where native labels such as "[[Elizabethan]]" and "[[Jacobean era|Jacobean]]" are more commonly applied. Seventeenth-century Artisan Mannerism is one exception, applied to architecture that relies on pattern books rather than on existing precedents in Continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson 1983, 157–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular note is the Flemish influence at Fontainebleau that combined the eroticism of the French style with an early version of the vanitas tradition that would dominate seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish painting. Prevalent at this time was the "pittore vago," a description of painters from the north who entered the workshops in France and Italy to create a truly international style.

==Sculpture==
As in painting, early Italian Mannerist sculpture was very largely an attempt to find an original style that would top the achievement of the [[High Renaissance]], which in sculpture essentially meant Michelangelo, and much of the struggle to achieve this was played out in commissions to fill other places in the [[Piazza della Signoria]] in Florence, next to [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]''. [[Baccio Bandinelli]] took over the project of ''[[Hercules and Cacus]]'' from the master himself, but it was little more popular then than it is now, and maliciously compared by [[Benvenuto Cellini]] to "a sack of melons", though it had a long-lasting effect in apparently introducing relief panels on the [[pedestal]] of statues.  Like other works of his and other Mannerists it removes far more of the original block than Michelangelo would have done.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 179–182&lt;/ref&gt;  Cellini's bronze ''[[Perseus with the head of Medusa]]'' is certainly a masterpiece, designed with eight angles of view, another Mannerist characteristic, and artificially stylized in comparison with the ''David''s of Michelangelo and Donatello.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 183–187&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a goldsmith, his famous gold and enamel [[Cellini Salt Cellar|Salt Cellar]] (1543) was his first sculpture, and shows his talent at its best.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;

Small bronze figures for collector's [[Cabinet (room)|cabinets]], often mythological subjects with nudes, were a popular Renaissance form at which [[Giambologna]], originally [[Flemish]] but based in Florence, excelled in the later part of the century. He also created life-size sculptures, of which two entered the collection in the Piazza della Signoria. He and his followers devised elegant elongated examples of the ''[[figura serpentinata]]'', often of two intertwined figures, that were interesting from all angles.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 194–202&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giorgio Vasari]]'s opinions about the art of painting emerge in the praise he bestows on fellow artists in his multi-volume ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'': he believed that excellence in painting demanded refinement, richness of invention (''invenzione''), expressed through virtuoso technique (''maniera''), and wit and study that appeared in the finished work, all criteria that emphasized the artist's intellect and the patron's sensibility. The artist was now no longer just a trained member of a local Guild of St Luke. Now he took his place at court alongside scholars, poets, and humanists, in a climate that fostered an appreciation for elegance and complexity. The coat-of-arms of Vasari's [[Medici]] patrons appears at the top of his portrait, quite as if it were the artist's own. The framing of the woodcut image of [[Vasari]]'s ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'' would be called "[[Jacobean era|Jacobean]]" in an English-speaking milieu. In it, Michelangelo's Medici tombs inspire the anti-architectural "architectural" features at the top, the papery pierced frame, the satyr nudes at the base. As a mere frame it is extravagant: Mannerist, in short.

===Gian Paolo Lomazzo===
Another literary figure from the period is [[Gian Paolo Lomazzo]], who produced two works—one practical and one metaphysical—that helped define the Mannerist artist's self-conscious relation to his art. His ''Trattato dell'arte della pittura, scoltura et architettura'' (Milan, 1584) is in part a guide to contemporary concepts of [[decorum]], which the Renaissance inherited in part from Antiquity but Mannerism elaborated upon. Lomazzo's systematic codification of aesthetics, which typifies the more formalized and academic approaches typical of the later 16th century, emphasized a consonance between the functions of interiors and the kinds of painted and sculpted decors that would be suitable. Iconography, often convoluted and abstruse, is a more prominent element in the Mannerist styles. His less practical and more metaphysical ''Idea del tempio della pittura'' (''The ideal temple of painting'', Milan, 1590) offers a description along the lines of the "four temperaments" theory of human nature and personality, defining the role of individuality in judgment and artistic invention.

==Some Mannerist artists==
[[File:Angelo Bronzino - Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time - National Gallery, London.jpg|thumb|230px|High Mannerism: ''[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]'' by [[Bronzino]], c. 1545; [[National Gallery|National Gallery, London]].]]

The Dragon seems of sino-oriental influence.]]

===Jacopo da Pontormo===
[[Pontormo|Jacopo da Pontormo]]'s ''Joseph in Egypt'' features what would in the Renaissance have been considered incongruous colors and an incoherent handling of time and space.

===Rosso Fiorentino and the School of Fontainebleau===
[[Rosso Fiorentino]], who had been a fellow pupil of Pontormo in the studio of [[Andrea del Sarto]], in 1530 brought Florentine mannerism to [[Fontainebleau]], where he became one of the founders of French 16th-century Mannerism, popularly known as the "[[School of Fontainebleau]]".

The examples of a rich and hectic decorative style at Fontainebleau further disseminated the Italian style through the medium of [[engraving]]s, to [[Antwerp]] and from there throughout Northern Europe from London to Poland. Mannerist design was extended to luxury goods like silver and carved furniture. A sense of tense, controlled emotion expressed in elaborate symbolism and [[allegory]], and an ideal of female beauty characterized by elongated proportions are features of this style.

===Agnolo Bronzino===
Mannerist portraits by [[Bronzino|Agnolo Bronzino]] are distinguished by a serene elegance and meticulous attention to detail. As a result, Bronzino's sitters have been said to project an aloofness and marked emotional distance from the viewer. There is also a virtuosic concentration on capturing the precise pattern and sheen of rich textiles.

===Alessandro Allori===
[[Alessandro Allori]]'s (1535–1607) ''Susanna and the Elders'' (''below'') is distinguished by latent eroticism and consciously brilliant still life detail, in a crowded, contorted composition.

===Tintoretto===
[[Tintoretto]]'s ''Last Supper'' (below) focuses on light and motion, bringing the image to dramatic life.  Unlike more traditional views of the Last Supper, Tintoretto depicts Heaven opening up into the room, and the [[angel]]s looking on in awe, in line with the old Catholic maxim that "If the angels were capable of envy, they would envy the Eucharist."

===El Greco===
[[El Greco]] attempted to express [[religious]] emotion with exaggerated traits. After the realistic depiction of the human form and the mastery of perspective achieved in high Renaissance Classicism, some artists started to deliberately distort proportions in disjointed, irrational space for emotional and artistic effect. El Greco still is a deeply original artist. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  Key aspects of Mannerism in El Greco include the jarring "acid" palette, elongated and tortured anatomy, irrational perspective and light, and obscure and troubling iconography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/gg29/gg29-over1.html |title=National Gallery of Art – El Greco |publisher=Nga.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/grec/hd_grec.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art El Greco (Domenikos Theotokopoulos) (1541–1614) |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benvenuto Cellini===

[[Benvenuto Cellini]] created the [[Cellini Salt Cellar]] of gold and enamel in 1540 featuring [[Poseidon]] and [[Amphitrite]] (water and earth) placed in uncomfortable positions and with elongated proportions. It is considered a masterpiece of Mannerist sculpture.

===Joachim Wtewael===
[[Joachim Wtewael]] (1566–1638) continued to paint in a Northern Mannerist style until the end of his life, ignoring the arrival of the Baroque, and making him perhaps the last significant Mannerist artist still to be working.  His subjects included large scenes with still life in the manner of [[Pieter Aertsen]], and mythological scenes, many small [[cabinet painting]]s beautifully executed on copper, and most featuring nudity.

===Giuseppe Arcimboldo===
[[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]] (also spelled ''Arcimboldi'') is known for his portraits contrived from a [[still life]] composition

==Mannerist architecture==
Mannerist architecture was characterized by visual trickery and unexpected elements that challenged the renaissance norms.&lt;ref name=vanda&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/s/style-guide-mannerism/ |title=Style Guide: Mannerism  |date= |website= |publisher=Victoria and Albert |access-date=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flemish artists, many of whom had traveled to Italy and were influenced by Mannerist developments there, were responsible for the spread of Mannerist trends into Europe north of the Alps, including into the realm of architecture. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Art|last=Wundram|first=Manfred|publisher=Grove|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period, architects experimented with using architectural forms to emphasize solid and spatial relationships. The Renaissance ideal of harmony gave way to freer and more imaginative rhythms. The best known architect associated with the Mannerist style, and a pioneer at the [[Laurentian Library]], was [[Michelangelo]] (1475–1564).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vSfOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT2&amp;dq=michelangelo+pioneered+mannerist+style#v=onepage&amp;q=michelangelo%20pioneered%20mannerist%20style&amp;f=false|page=Foreward|nopp=true|title=Michelangelo: 240 Colour Plates|isbn=9788892577916|last1=Peitcheva|first1=Maria|date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is credited with inventing the [[giant order]], a large pilaster that stretches from the bottom to the top of a façade.&lt;ref&gt;{{verify source|date=July 2014}}{{Citation | title= Pilaster Play|author= [[Mark Jarzombek]]| journal=  Thresholds | url= http://web.mit.edu/mmj4/www/downloads/thresholds28.pdf | volume= 28 (Winter 2005)|  pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used this in his design for the [[Campidoglio]] in Rome.

Prior to the 20th century, the term ''Mannerism'' had negative connotations, but it is now used to describe the historical period in more general non-judgmental terms.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Hauser. ''Mannerism: The Crisis of the Renaissance and the Origins of Modern Art''. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,1965).&lt;/ref&gt;  Mannerist architecture has also been used to describe a trend in the 1960s and 1970s that involved breaking the norms of modernist architecture while at the same time recognizing their existence.&lt;ref name=venturi/&gt; Defining mannerist in this context, architect and author [[Robert Venturi]] wrote "Mannerism for architecture of our time that acknowledges conventional order rather than original expression but breaks the conventional order to accommodate complexity and contradiction and thereby engages ambiguity unambiguously." &lt;ref name=venturi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://designtheory.fiu.edu/readings/venturi_architecture_as_signs.pdf |title=Architecture as Signs and Systems |last1=Venturi |first1=Robert |access-date=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance examples===

An example of mannerist architecture is the [[Villa Farnese]] at [[Caprarola]].&lt;ref&gt;Coffin David, ''The Villa in the Life of Renaissance Rome'', Princeton University Press, 1979: 281–85&lt;/ref&gt; in the rugged country side outside of [[Rome]]. The proliferation of engravers during the 16th century spread Mannerist styles more quickly than any previous styles.

Dense with ornament of "Roman" detailing, the display doorway at Colditz Castle exemplifies this northern style, characteristically applied as an isolated "set piece" against unpretentious vernacular walling.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

From the late 1560s onwards, many buildings in [[Valletta]], the new capital city of [[Malta]], were designed by the architect [[Girolamo Cassar]] in the Mannerist style. Such buildings include [[St. John's Co-Cathedral]], the [[Grandmaster's Palace (Valletta)|Grandmaster's Palace]] and the seven original [[Langue (Knights Hospitaller)#Valletta|auberges]]. Many of Cassar's buildings were modified over the years, especially in the [[Baroque]] period. However, a few buildings, such as [[Auberge d'Aragon]] and the exterior of St. John's Co-Cathedral, still retain most of Cassar's original Mannerist design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellul |first1=Michael |title=In search of Girolamo Cassar: An unpublished manuscript at the State Archives of Lucca |journal=Melita Historica |date=2004 |volume=XIV |issue=1 |page=37 |url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.14(2004-07)/MH.14(2004)1/02.pdf |issn=1021-6952 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313191703/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.14%282004-07%29/MH.14%282004%291/02.pdf |archivedate=13 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mannerism in literature and music==

{{See also|Metaphysical poets}}
In English literature, Mannerism is commonly identified with the qualities of the "Metaphysical" poets of whom the most famous is [[John Donne]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The witty sally of a Baroque writer, [[John Dryden]], against the verse of Donne in the previous generation, affords a concise contrast between Baroque and Mannerist aims in the arts:

{{quote|He affects the metaphysics, not only in his satires but in his amorous verses, ''where nature only'' should reign; and ''perplexes the minds'' of the fair sex with ''nice''&lt;ref&gt;'Nice' in the sense of 'finely reasoned.'&lt;/ref&gt; ''speculations'' of philosophy when he should ''engage their hearts'' and entertain them with the softnesses of love.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1957"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gardner, Helen |title=Metaphysical Poets |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zS_EXPFEtKwC&amp;q=dryden#v=snippet&amp;q=dryden&amp;f=false |publisher=Oxford University Press, London |year=1957 |accessdate=2014-08-15|isbn=9780140420388 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} (italics added)}}

The rich musical possibilities in the poetry of the late 16th and early 17th centuries provided an attractive basis for the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], which quickly rose to prominence as the pre-eminent musical form in Italian musical culture, as discussed by [[Tim Carter (musicologist)|Tim Carter]]:

{{quote|The madrigal, particularly in its aristocratic guise, was obviously a vehicle for the ‘stylish style’ of Mannerism, with poets and musicians revelling in witty conceits and other visual, verbal and musical tricks to delight the connoisseur.&lt;ref&gt;Carter 1991, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The word Mannerism has also been used to describe the style of highly florid and [[counterpoint|contrapuntally]] complex [[polyphonic]] music made in France in the late 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1946–47, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This period is now usually referred to as the ''[[ars subtilior]]''.

===Mannerism and theatre===
''The Early Commedia dell'Arte (1550–1621): The Mannerist Context'' by Paul Castagno discusses Mannerism's effect on the contemporary professional theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Castagno 1992,{{Page needed|date=June 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Castagno's was the first study to define a theatrical form as Mannerist, employing the vocabulary of Mannerism and maniera to discuss the typification, exaggerated, and effetto meraviglioso of the comici dell'arte. See Part II of the above book for a full discussion of Mannerist characteristics in the commedia dell'arte. The study is largely iconographic, presenting a pictorial evidence that many of the artists who painted or printed commedia images were in fact, coming from the workshops of the day, heavily ensconced in the maniera tradition.

The preciosity in [[Jacques Callot]]'s minute engravings seem to belie a much larger scale of action. Callot's ''Balli di Sfessania'' (literally, dance of the buttocks) celebrates the commedia's blatant eroticism, with protruding phalli, spears posed with the anticipation of a comic ream, and grossly exaggerated masks that mix the bestial with human. The eroticism of the innamorate (lovers) including the baring of breasts, or excessive veiling, was quite in vogue in the paintings and engravings from the second school at Fontainebleau, particularly those that detect a Franco-Flemish influence. Castagno demonstrates iconographic linkages between genre painting and the figures of the commedia dell'arte that demonstrate how this theatrical form was embedded within the cultural traditions of the late cinquecento.&lt;ref&gt;Castagno 1994, {{Page needed|date=June 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Commedia dell'arte, ''disegno interno'', and the ''discordia concors''====
Important corollaries exist between the ''disegno interno'', which substituted for the ''disegno esterno'' (external design) in mannerist painting. This notion of projecting a deeply subjective view as superseding nature or established principles (perspective, for example), in essence, the emphasis away from the object to its subject, now emphasizing execution, displays of virtuosity, or unique techniques. This inner vision is at the heart of commedia performance. For example, in the moment of improvisation the actor expresses his virtuosity without heed to formal boundaries, decorum, unity, or text. Arlecchino became emblematic of the mannerist ''discordia concors'' (the union of opposites), at one moment he would be gentle and kind, then, on a dime, become a thief violently acting out with his batte. Arlecchino could be graceful in movement, only in the next beat, to clumsily trip over his feet. Freed from the external rules, the actor celebrated the evanescence of the moment; much the way Cellini would dazzle his patrons by draping his sculptures, unveiling them with lighting effects and a sense of the marvelous. The presentation of the object became as important as the object itself.

=== Neo-Mannerism ===
According to art critic [[Jerry Saltz]], "Neo-Mannerism" (new Mannerism) is among several clichés that are "squeezing the life out of the art world".&lt;ref name="saltz"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Jerry Saltz on Art’s Insidious New Cliché: Neo-Mannerism |last=Saltz |first=Jerry |authorlink=Jerry Saltz |url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/10/jerry-saltz-on-arts-insidious-new-clich.html |publisher=Vulture |date=10 October 2013 |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neo-Mannerism describes art of the 21st century that is turned out by students whose academic teachers "have scared [them] into being pleasingly meek, imitative, and ordinary".&lt;ref name="saltz" /&gt;

'''Marathi cinema''' refers to Indian films produced in [[Marathi Language|Marathi]], the language of the state of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. Based in old [[Mumbai]], it is the oldest and one of the pioneer film industries of India. The first Marathi film to be released in India was ''Shree Pundalik'' by [[Dadasaheb Torne]] on 18 May 1912 at Coronation Cinematograph, Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kadam |first=Kumar |date=24 April 2012 |url=http://author.blogs.maharashtratimes.com/kokan/entry/%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%B8-%E0%A4%B9-%E0%A4%AC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008190417/http://author.blogs.maharashtratimes.com/kokan/entry/%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%B8-%E0%A4%B9-%E0%A4%AC |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 October 2013 |title=दादासाहेब तोरणेंचे विस्मरण नको! }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Pioneer"&gt;{{cite web |last = Raghavendara  |first = MK |date = 5 May 2012|url = http://www.dailypioneer.com/home/online-channel/top-story/62942-what-a-journey.html

The first Marathi talkie film, ''[[Ayodhyecha Raja]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prabhatfilm.com/films.htm|title=Films of Prabhat Film Company|accessdate=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in 1932, just one year after ''[[Alam Ara]]'' the first Hindi talkie. Although the industry is much smaller than the large market driven [[Hindi cinema]] based in [[Mumbai]], Marathi cinema is tax free, and is experiencing growth in recent years. ''[[Raja Harishchandra]]'', directed by [[Dadasaheb Phalke]], was a [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film, now known as India's first full-length feature, released in 1913. The [[Dadasaheb Phalke Award]] is India's highest award in cinema given annually by the [[Government of Maharashtra]] for lifetime contribution to [[Indian cinema]].

[[File:Raja Harishchandra.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Raja Harishchandra'']]
Marathi cinema is the oldest form of Indian cinema. The first Marathi movie released in India was ''Shree Pundalik'' by [[Dadasaheb Torne]] on 18 May 1912 at Coronation Cinematograph, Mumbai.&lt;ref name="Maharashtratimes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kadam |first=Kumar |date=2012-04-24 |url=http://author.blogs.maharashtratimes.com/kokan/entry/%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%B8-%E0%A4%B9-%E0%A4%AC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008190417/http://author.blogs.maharashtratimes.com/kokan/entry/%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%B8-%E0%A4%B9-%E0%A4%AC |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-10-08 |title=दादासाहेब तोरणेंचे विस्मरण नको! }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dadasaheb Phalke]] is known as the first pioneer and founder of cinema in pre-Independence India. He brought the revolution of moving images to India with his first indigenously made film ''[[Raja Harishchandra]]'' in 1913, which is considered by [[IFFI]] and NIFD as part of Marathi cinema as it was made by a Marathi dialogues while shooting and fully Marathi crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/48/20100209/1251/ten-marathi-cinema-can-surpass-hindi-cin.html |title=Marathi cinema can surpass Hindi cinema |publisher=Yahoo |accessdate=2010-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212155541/http://in.news.yahoo.com/48/20100209/1251/ten-marathi-cinema-can-surpass-hindi-cin.html |archivedate=12 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolhapur in Western Maharashtra was another centre of active film production in the twenties. In 1919 [[Baburao Mistry]]&amp;nbsp;— popularly known as Baburao Painter&amp;nbsp;— formed the [[Maharashtra Film Company]] with the blessings of the Maharaja of Kolhapur and released the first significant historical ''Sairandhari ''(1920) with Balasheb Pawar, Kamala Devi and Zunzarrao Pawar in stellar roles. Because of his special interest in sets, costumes, design and painting, he chose episodes from Maratha history for interpreting in the new medium and specialised in the historical genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemaofmalayalam.net/his_indian_cinema2.html |title=History of Regional cinema |publisher=Cinemaofmalayalam |accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baburao Painter made many silent movies till 1930. However, after a few more silent films, the [[Maharashtra Film Company]] pulled down its shutters with the advent of sound. Baburao was not particularly keen on the talkies for he believed that they would destroy the visual culture so painfully evolved over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upperstall.com/people/baburao-painter |title=Baburoa Painter |publisher=[[Upperstall]] |accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After advent of sound===
As cinema grew in Union of India, major production houses rose and one of them was again a company owned wholly by [[Maharashtrians]], the [[Prabhat Film Company]]. Prabhat's ''Sant Tukaram'' was the first Indian work to win the Best Film Award at the Venice film festival in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-09-28/mumbai/27162503_1_marathi-cinema-marathi-film-industry-film-makers | work=The Times Of India | first1=Niel | last1=Pate | title=Marathi cinema: Waiting to exhale | date=28 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1954 at the very first edition of the National Awards, ''[[Shyamchi Aai (film)|Shyamchi Aai]]'' another Marathi film, won the first President's Gold Medal for Cinema. It was directed by [[Pralhad Keshav Atre|Acharya P K Atre]], and it was an adaptation of the eponymous novel by Sane Guruji.&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-08-29/mumbai/27169092_1_marathi-cinema-marathi-films-shanta-gokhale | work=The Times Of India | first1=Mukta | last1=Rajadhyaksha | title=Marathi cinema gets a shot in the arm | date=29 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Golden era===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:marathifilmyanda.png|thumb|Ankush Chowdhary and Smita Shewale in ''Yanda kartavya aahe'']] --&gt;
Marathi cinema was in its full bloom by this time with the advent of greats like [[V. Shantaram]], [[Master Vinayak]], [[Bhalji Pendharkar]], [[Acharya Atre]], followed by [[Raja Paranjpe]], Jyotiram,sonal and mumtaz, Dinkar D Patil, [[G. D. Madgulkar]], [[Sudhir Phadke]] , [[Raja Thakur]] . The 1960s saw the emergence of directors like Anant Mane who made Marathi films based on the folk art form [[Tamasha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mymarathicinema.blogspot.com |title=Marathi cinema database }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then came directors like Datta Dharmadhikari and Raj Dutt who made traditional family dramas. The early 70s saw the advent of [[Dada Kondke]] who captured the audiences with his sense of humour. He went on to create satirical, pun-ridden films often including social and political commentary, many of which became [[cult classics]]. By this time Marathi cinema was caught in either the [[Tamasha]] genre or tragedies revolving around traditional family dramas on one side and the comedies of [[Dada Kondke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kale|first1=Pramod|title=Ideas, Ideals and the Market: A Study of Marathi Films|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=1979|volume=14,|issue=35|pages=1511–1520|jstor=4367902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
The 1980s saw two comedy heroes catapult to stardom, [[Ashok Saraf]] and [[Laxmikant Berde]]. Around the mid-80s two young actors donned the director's mantle: [[Mahesh Kothare]] and [[Sachin (actor)|Sachin Pilgaonkar]]. [[Sachin (actor)|Pilgaonkar]] directed ''Navri Mile Navryala'' and around the same time Mahesh Kothare directed ''Dhumdhadaka''. [[Sachin (actor)|Pilgaonkar]]'s film was a box-office hit while Mahesh Kothare's became a mega hit at the box-office, became a trend-setter, and brought young audiences to Marathi cinema. Mahesh Kothare went on to make comedy films that became major hits. He made the first Marathi film shot on the anamorphic format (Cinemascope)&amp;nbsp;— ''Dhadakebaaz''. He brought a number of innovations in the technical quality of Marathi films and was the first to bring [[Dolby Digital]] sound to Marathi cinema with ''Chimni Pakhara''. He made the first Marathi film with Digital Special Effects, ''[[Pachadlela]]'', in 2004. He also made first Marathi movie in [[3D film|3D]] ''[[Zapatlela 2]]'', in 2013. The 3D of this film was highly appreciated and technically this film was extremely well made. This film also went on to become a blockbuster. Currently Mahesh Kothare is working on Zapatlela 3. This for the first time that a franchise has emerged in Marathi cinema.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Reasons for the decline of Marathi cinema===
While the theatre of [[Maharashtra]] earned recognition at the national level, the cinema failed to make a mark. A major reason was the proximity to the production centre of Hindi cinema ([[Bollywood]]), which encroached on the identity of Marathi cinema. Other reasons include the shortage of cinema halls for distribution due to poor marketing, lack of money magnets, a vibrant theatre scene and the emergence of private television. It also lacked the powerful lobby at the national level unlike Bengali and South Indian cinema because state congress (ruling party over 40 years) encouraged Hindi cinema for profit mainly; the regional film industrial advantage being soaked up by Bollywood.&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"/&gt;

===Revival: Marathi New Wave===
In past few years, the Marathi cinema industry has produced many films that are not only critically acclaimed but commercially successful as well. It has brought fresh ideas, untouched subjects and deeper human sensitivity on the celluloid.

Acclaimed director Dr [[Jabbar Patel]] explains the reasons behind the change, "The kind of Marathi cinema that is being made today is very fresh and different. This is thanks to directors and writers getting exposed to world cinema via television, film festivals etc. They are coming up with new storylines and innovative concepts."

Actor [[Mrinal Kulkarni]] remarks, "There is a lot of content and variety in Marathi films. A lot of bold subjects have been handled well by them. They carry a lot of substance." But, she adds, "We need to start watching a lot more Marathi films. Until we see the films ourselves, we will never be able to appreciate them when they are sent to the [[Oscars]]."

With outstanding contribution and efforts from different producers and directors of the Mumbai film industry, Marathi cinema relatively outshined other Indian film industries such as [[Bollywood]] in the first quarter of 2010 in box office collections and critical appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_story.aspx?from=bottomrelated&amp;ID=ENTEN20100136669&amp;Keyword=regional Marathi films beat Hindi movies at BO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804070359/http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_story.aspx?from=bottomrelated&amp;ID=ENTEN20100136669&amp;Keyword=regional |date=4 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
Marathi cinema received critical acclaim in 2004 with the film ''[[Shwaas]]'' winning the Golden Lotus National Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/National_Film_Awards_India/2004|title=National Film Awards, India: 2004|accessdate=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was India's official entry to the 77th Academy Awards. It won the President's medal for best film, beating Bollywood's prolific output with quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2004/sep/24shwas.htm |title=Shwaas is India's Official Entry to Oscars|accessdate=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shwaas'' was the second Marathi film to win the President's Medal after ''[[Shyamchi Aai]]'' (1950).

The [[Maharashtra]] state government has begun to issue grants to Marathi film (between 1.5 million and 3.0 million rupees). After the success of ''Shwaas'', Indian media players like Shringar Films and Zee Telefilms are exhibiting a re-emerging interest in Marathi cinema. The growing popularity of Marathi television (notably [[Zee Marathi]] and [[ETV Marathi]]) has helped to popularize older Marathi cinema and promote the genre. [[Zee Talkies]], a 24-hour channel dedicated to Marathi movies, has been introduced.

In 2009, [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film ''[[Harishchandrachi Factory]]'' (with a budget of Rs. 6 crore), depicting the struggle of [[Dadasaheb Phalke]] in making ''[[Raja Harishchandra]]'' in 1913, India's first feature film, directed by theatre-veteran [[Paresh Mokashi]] was selected as India's [[List of Indian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|official entry]] to [[Academy Award]] in the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] category, making it the second Marathi film, after ''[[Shwaas]]'', to receive this honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-09-20/india/28076656_1_marathi-film-paresh-mokashi-foreign-film-category 'Harishchandrachi Factory' India's entry for Oscars] [[Indian Express]], PTI 20 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/harishchandrachi-factory-to-tell-story-behind-making-of-indias-first-feature-film/304892/ Harishchandrachi Factory to tell story behind making of India’s first feature film] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930065757/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/harishchandrachi-factory-to-tell-story-behind-making-of-indias-first-feature-film/304892/ |date=30 September 2012 }}, ''[[Indian Express]]'', Express News Service, 3 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptinews.com/news/291828_-Harishchandrachi-factory--India-s-entry-for-Oscars 'Harishchandrachi factory' India's entry for Oscars]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [[Press Trust of India]], 20 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

2009 saw the blockbuster musical movie ''[[Natarang]]'', which both commercial and critical applause and has served as a path-breaking movie for Marathi cinema.

Since the new decade beginning in 2010, several contemporary Marathi artistic films released including [[Umesh Vinayak Kulkarni]]'s ''[[Vihir]]'' and ''[[Deool]]'', and [[Nagraj Manjule]]'s ''[[Fandry]]''. They have given a new direction to Marathi films.

[[Deool]] became the third movie after Shyaamchi Aai and Shwaas to win the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film]]

[[Sairat]] (2016) musical romantic drama starring Rinku Rajguru and Akash Thosar, directed by Nagraj Manjule and produced by Nagraj Manjule, Nitin Keni, and Nikhil Sane emerged as the biggest weekend opener for a Marathi film breaking record previously held by Natsamrat. Sairat was the first Marathi film to cross ₹50 crore (US$7.8 million) mark. The film has become the first Marathi film to gross over ₹100 crore (US$16 million) worldwide. Also it ran for more than 100 days in many centres of Maharashtra.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5068">[[Image:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Hunters in the Snow (Winter) - Google Art Project.jpg|400px|thumb| ''Into thir dirk and drublie dayis, Quhone sabill all the hevin arrayis''. [[The Hunters in the Snow]] depicts Winter in Northern Europe during the [[Sixteenth Century]].''']] '''Meditatioun In Wyntir''' is a contemplative poem in [[Scots language|Scots]] by [[William Dunbar]] (born 1459 or 1460).&lt;ref name="Mackay Mackenzie"/&gt;

In the work, Dunbar describes how Winter [[Seasonal affective disorder|lowers his spirits]]. While beset by [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] and [[insomnia]], he meditates indecisively on thwarted ambition, ageing and mortality, causing him to become [[Depression (mood)|depressed]]. The approaching end of Winter restores his sense of hope.

The poem seems to be inspired by Dunbar's personal experience; his brief reference to dissatisfaction of life "into this court" might be interpreted as referring to the royal court of [[James IV of Scotland|King James IV]].

The text is preserved in the [[Maitland Manuscripts|Maitland Folio Manuscript]].&lt;ref name="Mackay Mackenzie"&gt;W. Mackay Mackenzie, ''The Poems of William Dunbar'', The Mercat press, 1990, pp. 26-27, 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

'''Meditatioun In Wyntir''' is composed in a sober, thoughtful style in ten stanzas of five lines each. It opens with a description of the season and the depressing effect of its weather and lengthening nights. The poet [[Anhedonia|cannot find pleasure]] in songs, poetry or plays.

:Into thir dirk and drublie dayis,
:Quhone [[Sable (heraldry)|sabill]] all the hevin arrayis,
:With mystie vapouris, cluddis, and skyis,
:Nature all curage me denyis,
:Of sangis, ballattis, and of playis.

:Quhone that the nycht dois lenthin houris,
:With wind, with haill, and havy schouris,
:My dule [[wikt:spirit|spreit]] dois lurk for [[Shore|schoir]],
:My hairt for [[wikt:languor|langour]] dois forloir,
:For laik of symmer with his flouris.&lt;ref name="The Text"&gt;[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/dunfrm1.htm The full text with notes at TEAMS]&lt;/ref&gt;

Suffering from insomnia and the "heavy thoughts" that accompany it, his mind is troubled.

:I walk, I turne, sleip may I nocht,
:I vexit am with havie thocht,
:'his warld all ovir I cast about,
:And ay the mair I am in dout,
:The mair that I [[wikt:remedy|remeid]] have socht.&lt;ref name="The Text"/&gt;

He is visited by four personifications, who offer him conflicting advice. "Despair" tells him that he
must find a reliable livelihood or face an unhappy and difficult life.

:I am assayit on everie syde,
:Despair sayis ay, In tyme provyde,
:And get sumthing quhairon to leif,
:Or with grit trouble and mischeif,
:Thow sall into this court abyd.&lt;ref name="The Text"/&gt;

"Patience" disagrees and urges the poet to be steady and hopeful that his luck will change. 
"Fortune's" anger can not be appeased with reason, she adds.

:Than Patience sayis, Be not agast,
:Hald [[Hope|Hoip]] and [[Truth|Treuthe]] within the fast,
:And lat [[Fortuna|Fortoun]] wirk furthe hir rage,
:Quhome that no rasoun may assuage,
:Quhill that hir [[Hourglass|glas]] be run and past.&lt;ref name="The Text"/&gt;

"Prudence" then accuses him of being inconsistent in his aims. He clings to things that cannot last. He is  "tending to another place" and "making a journey every day."

:And Prudence in my eir sayis ay,
:Quhy wald thow hald that will away?
:Or [[wikt:crave|craif]] that thow may have no space,
:Thow tending to ane uther place,
:A journay going everie day.&lt;ref name="The Text"/&gt;

"Age", in exceptionally friendly terms, invites the poet to take his hand then reminds him 
that he will eventually have to "make account" for his life.

:And than sayis Age, My freind, cum neir,
:And be not strange I thee requeir,
:Cum, brodir, by the hand me tak,
:Remember thow hes compt to mak,
:Of all thi tyme thow spendit heir.&lt;ref name="The Text"/&gt;

''[[Death (personification)|Death]]'' opens his gates and says bluntly, "Through there, you will abide", 
adding "You will stoop under this lintel, there is no other way".

:Syne Deid castis upe his [[Gate|yettis]] wyd,
:Saying Thir oppin sall the abyd,
:Albeid that thow wer never sa stout,
:Undir this [[Lintel (architecture)|lyntall]] sall thow lowt,
:Thair is nane uther way besyde.&lt;ref name="The Text"/&gt;

No pleasure can stop the poet from dwelling on his unhappy thoughts.

:For feir of this all day I drowp,
:No gold in [[Chest (furniture)|kist]] nor wyne in cowp,
:No ladeis bewtie nor luiffis blys,
:May lat me to remember this,
:How glaid that ever I dyne or sowp.&lt;ref name="The Text"/&gt;

Only the shortening of the nights begins to restore his happiness. He longs for the arrival of Summer.

:Yit quhone the nycht begynnis to schort,
:It dois my spreit sum pairt confort,
:Of thocht oppressit with the schowris,
:Cum, lustie Symmer with thi flowris,
:That I may leif in sum disport.&lt;ref name="The Text"/&gt;

'''''Optimism Monthly''''' was a Czech not-for-profit [[literary magazine]], which from 1995 to 2009 published poetry, prose, and art by Prague-based and international writers. When operational, Optimism published a new edition each month for ten months of the year. Each issue was published in English and contained writers from across Europe, as far east as Bulgaria, as well as American and Australian authors. It sold for 49 Czech [[Czech koruna|crowns]] in English-Language book stores across Prague, Europe, the United States and Australia. As of 2009, it had published works by over one hundred and thirty writers. It was started by an American, Tim Otis, who was joined after the second issue by another American, Thomas Alan Ward, as editor, after issue 30, Ward was replaced by Laura Conway.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3940">'''Orphaned technology''' is a descriptive term for [[computer]] products, programs, and platforms that have been abandoned by their original developers.  Orphaned technology refers to [[software]], such as [[abandonware]] and [[Vintage computing|antique]] software, but also to [[computer hardware]] and practices.  In computer software standards and documentation, [[deprecation]] is the gradual phasing-out of a software or [[programming language]] feature, while orphaning usually connotes a sudden discontinuation, usually for business-related reasons, of a product with an active user base.

For users of technologies that have been withdrawn from the market, there is a choice between maintaining their software support environments in some form of [[emulation (computing)|emulation]], or switching to other supported products, possibly losing capabilities unique to their original solution.

&lt;!-- Suggest adding the year of discontinuance, and sorting in that order; See Talk:Orphaned technology --&gt;
Some well-known examples of orphaned technology include:
* [[Coleco ADAM]] - 8-bit [[home computer]]
* [[TI 99/4A]] - 16-bit [[home computer]]
* [[Mattel Aquarius]]
* [[Apple Lisa]] - 16/32-bit graphical computer
* [[Apple Newton|Newton PDA]] (Apple Newton) - tablet computer
* [[DEC Alpha]] - 64-bit [[microprocessor]]
* [[HyperCard]] - hypermedia

'''Paul Souriau''' (1852–1926) was a [[France|French]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] known for his works on [[Invention|invention theory]] and [[aesthetics]].

He studied at the [[École normale supérieure]] where he wrote a [[thesis or dissertation|doctoral thesis]] entitled ''Théorie de l'invention'' published in 1881. In his thesis, he argues that inventions are not the result of a rigorous scientific method but rather come as a [[Determinism|deterministic]] consequence of a set of conditions in which the inventor lives. This theory was contested very soon after its publication in the 1882 edition of the ''Revue Internationale de l'Enseignement''.&lt;ref&gt;Société de l'enseignement supérieur (1882) [https://books.google.com/books?id=TdfNAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=th%C3%A9orie%20de%20l'invention%20souriau&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PR8#v=onepage&amp;q=th%C3%A9orie%20de%20l'invention%20souriau&amp;f=false Revue internationale de l'enseignement, Volume 3], G. Masson, ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1882 his wife gave birth to [[Étienne Souriau]], who also became a philosopher in [[aesthetics]]. The French thesis was created simultaneously with a [[Latin]] thesis titled ''De motus perceptione''. The Latin thesis emphasized the importance of vision in movement perception, hence the initial title ''De visione motus''.&lt;ref&gt;Guyard MM. S., Havet L., Monod G., Paris G. (1882) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8fbUAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=th%C3%A9orie%20de%20l'invention&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage&amp;q=souriau&amp;f=false Revue critique d'histoire et de littérature, Volume 1], Ernest Leroux, ed.&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis was a precursor for his later works on movement perception.

He became a professor at the Faculté des Lettres de [[Lille]] (now [[Université Lille Nord de France|University of Lille]]) very soon after its foundation in 1887. In 1889, he published his reflections on the aesthetics of movement.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Souriau (1889) [https://books.google.com/books?id=j7YRAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false L'esthétique du mouvement], Félix Alcan, ed.&lt;/ref&gt; The book described two levels of movement [[aesthetics]]: the mechanical beauty (the adaptation of the movement to fulfil its goal) and the movement expression (the meaning of the movement for an observer). By doing so Souriau distinguished movement from perception of movement, two concepts which later became the subjects of studies of [[motor cognition]] and [[psychophysics]].

Throughout his career, but more particularly during the first decade of the 20th century, he published his reflections on the [[aesthetics]] of arts while being a professor at [[Henri Poincaré University]] ([[Nancy, France|Nancy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Souriau (1901) [https://archive.org/stream/limaginationdel00sourgoog#page/n12/mode/1up L'imagination de l'artiste], Librairie Hachette et Cie, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Souriau (1904) [https://archive.org/stream/labeautrationne01sourgoog#page/n10/mode/1up La beauté rationnelle], Félix Alcan, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Souriau (1906) [https://archive.org/stream/larverieesthtiq01sourgoog#page/n9/mode/1up La rêverie esthétique: essai sur la psychologie du poète], Félix Alcan, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Souriau (1909) [https://archive.org/stream/lasuggestiondans00souruoft#page/n9/mode/2up La suggestion dans l'art], Félix Alcan, ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his life, [[Félix Alcan]] was his main editor.

[[File:Correggio_058.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of a Man with a Book'']]
'''''Portrait of a Man with a Book''''' is an oil on canvas painting by [[Correggio]], dated to around 1522. It was bequeathed to the [[Pinacoteca del Castello Sforzesco]] in Milan (where it now hangs) in 1945 by Lydia Caprara Morando Attendolo Bolognini. It is sometimes instead attributed to [[Parmigianino]] but majority opinion is that it dates to Correggio's first mature period, which is supported by the fact that it was painted directly on top of the sketch, an informal technique suggesting it was made for a close friend of the artist.

It shows a man in a black coat and black cap three-quarter-length against a wooded background, reading from a tiny book held in his right hand, argued by [[Roberto Longhi]] to be a [[book of hours]]&lt;ref&gt;''Edizione delle opere complete'', Roberto Longhi. Author, Roberto Longhi. Publisher, Sansoni, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and by others such as Muzzi to be a ''Petrarchino'' (ie a miniature edition of [[Petrarch]]'s ''[[Il Canzoniere]]''). If it is the latter, the bee in the background may refer to poems CXC and CCCXIX of the work.

'''''Rejtan, or the Fall of Poland''''' ({{lang-pl|Rejtan. Upadek Polski}}) is an [[oil painting]] by the [[Poles|Polish]] artist [[Jan Matejko]], finished in 1866, depicting the protest of [[Tadeusz Rejtan]] (''lower right'') against the [[First Partition of Poland]] during the [[Partition Sejm]] of 1773.  Both a depiction of a historical moment, and an [[allegory]] for the surrounding period of [[Polish history]], the painting is one of Matejko's most famous works, and an iconic picture of an emotional protest.&lt;ref name="FoundationJaworska1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LukowskiZawadzki2006"/&gt;

==Historical context==
[[Tadeusz Rejtan]] was a deputy in the [[Sejm]] (parliament) of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1773, infamously known as the [[Partition Sejm]].&lt;ref name="Cummins1993"/&gt; The Sejm convened to review the demands of the Commonwealth's three neighbours (the [[Russian Empire]], [[Prussia]] and [[Austria]]) in order to legalize their territorial demands, known as the [[First Partition of Poland]].&lt;ref name="Corwin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smoleński1919"/&gt; The Sejm operated under duress, with the immediate threat of foreign forces present in the Commonwealth, and with a significant number of deputies either bribed or threatened by foreign diplomats.&lt;ref name="Corwin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smoleński1919"/&gt; The three powers officially justified their actions as a compensation for dealing with a troublesome neighbor and restoring order through military intervention in the civil war (the [[War of Bar Confederation]]); in fact all three were interested in territorial gains.&lt;ref name="conquest"/&gt;

On 21 April that year, Rejtan, in a dramatic gesture at the Sejm, is said to have bared his chest and laid himself down in a doorway, blocking the way with his own body in a dramatic attempt to stop the other members from leaving the chamber where the debate was being held. Leaving of the chamber would have signified an end to the discussion, and the acceptance of the motion, meaning the acceptance of foreign territorial demands.&lt;ref name="Cummins1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jm"/&gt;

==Scene description==
The painting portrays this scene, although as usual with Matejko's work, it sacrifices some historical reality for more dramatic presentation.&lt;ref name="odk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="am"/&gt; It serves as an [[allegory]] for all three [[Partitions of Poland]] (1772, 1793, 1795) and portrays a number of major historical figures of this era.&lt;ref name=odk/&gt;&lt;ref name="am"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; Rejtan is the most visible, occupying the entire right side of the painting, in the midst of his dramatic pose which has been compared to ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]''.&lt;ref name="am"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; His position on this painting exemplifies the [[golden ratio]].&lt;ref name="am"/&gt;

To his left, in the center, are the "traitors", many of them on the Russian payroll, and future members of the [[Targowica Confederation]]. [[Adam Poniński (1732-1798)|Adam Poniński]], [[marshal of the Sejm]], pointing in red court dress, either demands that Rejtan leaves or points to the armed Russian guards outside the door; he holds a simple wooden walking stick instead of a  more elaborate marshall's staff, which Rejtan stole a day earlier.&lt;ref name="am"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; Behind him are bishop [[Ignacy Massalski]] and Prince [[Antoni Stanisław Czetwertyński-Światopełk]].&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; To his right, Hetman [[Franciszek Ksawery Branicki]] hides his face in his hands; which likely was Matejko's solution for a prosaic problem — he probably did not have access to a likeness of Branicki. [[Szczęsny Potocki]], with the blue sash, looks to the ground, embarrassed. Behind the overturned chair, his father, [[Franciszek Salezy Potocki]], also embarrassed, drops a quill pen and looks away.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; Between the two Potockis [[Jacek Małachowski]] is engaged in discussion with [[Samuel Korsak]],&lt;ref name="Matejko1993-1962"/&gt; while [[Karol Stanisław "Panie Kochanku" Radziwiłł|Karol Radziwiłł]] simply observes the situation, amused.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; On the ground, turned over, lies an amchair, with Branicki's hat and a coin purse, from which the coins spill towards Poniński, alluding to the real reason he is intent on concluding the debate.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982"/&gt;

To the left of the elder Potocki, the seated [[primate of Poland]], [[Michał Jerzy Poniatowski]], is engaged in a conversation with the chancellor [[Michał Fryderyk Czartoryski]], both ignoring the disruption.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; Behind them in the blue waistcoat, King [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]], annoyed, stands up from the throne, wanting to leave, and looking at his pocket watch.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt;

From the gallery, the scene is observed by one of the main architects of the partitions, [[Ambassadors and envoys from Russia to Poland (1763–1794)|Russian ambassador]] [[Nicholas Repnin]].&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; He is seated between two ladies, likely [[Izabela Lubomirska]] and either [[Elżbieta Grabowska]] or [[Izabela Czartoryska]].&lt;ref name="am"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; To his right, another important symbol is shown in the painting of Russian Tsarina [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine of Russia]].&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; Finally, in the open doors, behind Rejtan, stands a Russian soldier (although in reality the Sejm was "guarded" not by Russian, but by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] troops).&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt;

The only person clearly sympathetic to Rejtan is a young man in the middle of the room, holding in his hands a saber and a [[rogatywka]], symbolizing the supporters of the anti-Russian [[Bar Confederation]], and future insurgents from the [[Polish Uprisings]] in the [[Russian partition]].&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt;

==History, reception and significance==
Matejko began work on this painting in August 1864 and finished it in November 1866.&lt;ref name="Matejko1993-1963"/&gt; It was one of many paintings portraying key historical moments in the [[history of Poland]] that he would create over his life.&lt;ref name="am"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; Matejko however did not simply illustrate the history, he intended his paintings to have powerful educational and emotional values.&lt;ref name="am"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morawińska1984"/&gt;

The work caused a scandal in contemporary, still-partitioned Poland; it was discussed even before its unveiling.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; It offended a number of society figures, many tracing direct lineage to the major [[magnates of Poland and Lithuania|magnate]] families whose members are portrayed in the painting as traitors to the Polish cause.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; There were a number of critical reviews of the work in the contemporary press, Matejko received anonymous threats, and some aristocrats are said to have considered buying the painting only to destroy it.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; Some accused him of defeatism, pessimism, exploiting public sentiment over a historical scandal for contemporary publicity; it was thus criticized by notable artists such as [[Józef Ignacy Kraszewski]] and [[Cyprian Norwid]].&lt;ref name="am"/&gt;&lt;ref name=dekada/&gt; In Paris, a French-Polish aristocrat, [[Count Alexandre Joseph Colonna-Walewski]], campaigned against including it in an exhibition.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; The painting, however, quickly garnered supporters, who in turn reproduced modified copies of it, replacing historical figures with major contemporary critics.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; Responding to the public outcry, Matejko painted a response — a painting titled ''[[Judgement on Matejko]]'' (''Wyrok na Matejkę'', 1867), in which he portrayed his execution by some of his most vocal critics.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dekada"/&gt;

Serious art critics had less emotional, but also mixed, opinions of the work.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; It was received less favourably by [[Józef Szujski]] and [[Stanisław Tarnowski]], but praised by painters [[Henryk Siemiradzki]] and [[Artur Grottger]].&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; Comments of [[Wojciech Korneli Stattler]] are interpreted by different authors as either praise,&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; or critique.&lt;ref name="am"/&gt; In Paris, displayed at ''[[International Exposition (1867)|Exposition Universelle]]'', 1867 the painting received a gold medal.&lt;ref name=dekada/&gt; While in Poland the painting's context and message was clearly understood, the work, displayed in Paris, proved to be too obscure for the audience there, with few understanding the complex, historical context; some French critics interpreted it as a painting of a gambling hall.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; It is said, however, to have been well understood by the Russian visitors to the French gallery, some of whom are said to have been interested in acquiring the painting, which was commended by Poles as "they bought the real ones, might as well buy the painted ones, too".&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; Eventually, however, the painting was acquired by Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] for 50,000 franks.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matejko1993-1963"/&gt; It was shown at a gallery in Vienna, and eventually ended up at the [[Imperial Natural History Museum|Hofmuseum]].&lt;ref name="Matejko1993-1963"/&gt; Thanks to the efforts of minister [[Juliusz Twardowski]] it was purchased by the government of the [[Second Polish Republic]] in 1920.&lt;ref name="Matejko1993-1963"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartelik2005"/&gt; As part of the [[Wawel Royal Castle National Art Collection]] it has been on a public display in the [[Royal Castle in Warsaw]] since 1931, with the exception of the period of [[World War II]], when it was briefly [[Nazi looting|looted by the Nazis]].&lt;ref name="Matejko1993-1963"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ks"/&gt;

The painting is usually interpreted as criticism of the Russian interference in Polish political affairs, and the collaboration of treasonous Polish aristocrats.&lt;ref name="Mendelsohn2002"/&gt; By the end of [[World War I]] it was already seen as a priceless artifact of Polish culture.&lt;ref name="Bartelik2005"/&gt; The painting was positively interpreted in [[communist Poland]] as a symbol of critique of the Polish nobility, blamed for their selfishness leading to the partitions.&lt;ref name="am"/&gt; More recently, the painting has been interpreted as the symbol of solitary protest, and a moral justification of dissent, even when such a protest is known to be futile, ignored by most.&lt;ref name="am"/&gt; It has also been described as an iconic picture of an emotional protest&lt;ref name="LukowskiZawadzki2006"/&gt; and a symbol of desperate, patriotic protest.&lt;ref name="Uhlig1989"/&gt; In the 1980s the painting inspired a [[protest song]] by [[Jacek Kaczmarski]].&lt;ref name="kaczmarski"/&gt; Over time, the painting has become famous in Poland; Walter M. Cummins notes that the scene from this work was "made familiar to every Polish child by [this] frequently reproduced painting".&lt;ref name="Cummins1993"/&gt;

The '''Royal Canadian Academy of Arts''' ('''RCA''') is a Canadian [[art]]s-related organization that was founded in 1880.

==History==
===1880 to 1890===
The title of Royal Canadian Academy of Arts was received from [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] on 16 July 1880. The [[Governor General of Canada]], the [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|Marquess of Lorne]], was its first patron. The painter [[Lucius Richard O'Brien|Lucius O’Brien]] was its first President.

The objects of the Academy as stated in the 1881 publication of the organization's constitution&lt;ref name=RCA_Act1881&gt;{{cite book|title=Constitution and Laws of the Royal Canadian Academy of the Arts|year=1881|publisher=Globe Printing Co., Printer|location=Toronto|page=1|url=http://ebooks.library.ualberta.ca/local/cihm_12893}}&lt;/ref&gt; were three-fold:
*First - the institution of a National Gallery at the seat of Government;
*Second - the holding of Exhibitions in the principal cities of the Dominion;
*Third - the establishment of Schools of Art and Design.

In the same publication, two levels of membership were described: Academicians and Associates. No more than forty individuals could be Academicians at one time, while the number of Associates was not limited. All Academicians were required to give an example of their work to the collection of the [[National Gallery of Canada|National Gallery]]. They were also permitted to show more pieces in Academy-sponsored exhibitions than Associates.&lt;ref name=RCA_Act1881 /&gt;

The inaugural exhibition was held in Ottawa and the first Academicians were inducted, including the first woman Academician, [[Charlotte Schreiber]]. Through the next 10 years, the Academy held annual exhibitions, often in cooperation with regional artists' societies. Exhibitions in Toronto were a joint project of the Academy and the [[Ontario Society of Artists]], while those held in Montreal were held in partnership with the [[Montreal Artists Association]]. Exhibitions were also held in St. John, [[New Brunswick]], and [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name=RCA_Report1886&gt;{{cite book|title=Report and review of financial position and prospective policy of the Academy to His Excellency the Most Hon. the Marquis of Lansdowne, Governor-General, Patron of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, 1886|year=1886|publisher=Royal Canadian Academy of Arts|location=Ottawa|url=http://ebooks.library.ualberta.ca/local/cihm_45606}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional academicians and associates were added each year until the membership had more than doubled by 1890. Members were drawn from all areas of the country and included anglophones and francophones. Men continued to out-number women and those female members were identified as painters not as designers or architects.&lt;ref name=RCA_Founding /&gt;

As Academicians joined, they donated an example of their work to the National Gallery of Canada, building the collection of the as-yet unincorporated institution. A temporary home was found for the collection in a building next to the Supreme Court of Canada and the first curator, John W. H. Watts, RCA was appointed to begin organizing exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History: Pre 1900|url=http://www.gallery.ca/en/about/pre-1900.php|publisher=National Gallery of Canada|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third objective—to encourage the teaching of art and design in Canada—was found to be more challenging to address with the limited financial resources available to them.&lt;ref name=RCA_Report1886 /&gt;

===1891 to present===
Canadian landscape painter [[Homer Watson]] was elected as an associate, became a full member and later became president of the Academy.

The centennial year of the Academy was honoured by a 35 cent, 3 colour postage stamp.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130116010109/http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/ourl/res.php?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;url_tim=2012-07-24T13:57:38Z&amp;url_ctx_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=2218678&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/collectionscanada.gc.ca:pam&amp;lang=eng Credit: Library and Archives Canada; Copyright: Canada Post Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt; The stamp features an image of the original centre block of the [[Parliament Buildings (Canada)|Parliament Buildings]] and the text "Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, 1880–1980", with the name "[[Thomas Fuller (architect)|Thomas Fuller]]", a member of the Academy and the Dominion Architect of Canada &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/pages/4_thomas-fuller.aspx Dominion Architect]&lt;/ref&gt; who had designed the original building.

==Members==
The Academy is composed of members from across Canada representing over twenty visual arts disciplines. This list is not inclusive. See also [[:Category:Members of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]].

'''''Rudin''''' ({{lang-ru|«Рудин»}}, {{IPA-ru|ˈrudʲɪn|pron}}) is the first [[novel]] by [[Ivan Turgenev]], a famous Russian writer best known for his short stories and the novel ''[[Fathers and Sons (novel)|Fathers and Sons]]''. Turgenev started to work on it in 1855, and it was first published in the literary magazine "[[Sovremennik]]" in 1856; several changes were made by Turgenev in subsequent editions. It is perhaps the least known of Turgenev's novels.

''Rudin'' was the first of Turgenev's novels, but already in this work the topic of the [[superfluous man]] and his inability to act (which became a major theme of Turgenev's literary work) was explored. Similarly to other Turgenev's novels, the main conflict in Rudin was centred on a [[love]] story of the main character and a young, but intellectual and self-conscious woman who is contrasted with the main hero (this type of female character became known in literary criticism as «тургеневская девушка», “Turgenev maid”).

__TOC__

== Context ==
''Rudin'' was written by Turgenev in the immediate aftermath of the [[Crimean War]], when it became obvious to many educated Russians that reform was needed. The main debate of Turgenev's own generation was that of [[Slavophiles]] versus Westernizers. ''Rudin'' depicts a typical man of this generation (known as 'the men of forties'), intellectual but ineffective. This interpretation of the superfluous man as someone who possesses great intellectual ability and potential, but is unable to realize them stems from Turgenev's own view of human nature, expressed in his 1860 speech ‘Hamlet and Don Quixote’, where he contrasts egotistical [[Hamlet]], too deep in reflection to act, and enthusiastic and un-thinking, but active [[Don Quixote]]. The main character of the novel, Rudin, is easily identified with Hamlet.

Many critics suggest that the image of Rudin was at least partly autobiographical. Turgenev himself maintained the character was a "fairly faithful" portrait of the anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]], whom the author knew well. [[Alexander Herzen]], who knew both men, said in his memoirs that the vacillating Rudin had more in common with the liberal Turgenev than the insurrectionist Bakunin.&lt;ref name="kelly"&gt;Kelly, Aileen, ''Mikhail Bakunin: A Study in the Psychology and Politics of Utopianism'', 1987, Yale University Press, pp. 74-75, 254&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudin is often compared to [[Pushkin]]’s [[Eugene Onegin]] and [[Lermontov]]’s [[Pechorin]]. The latter two are considered to be representations of their generations (‘men of twenties’ and ‘men of thirties’ respectively) as Rudin is considered to be a representation of his generation; the three literary works featuring these characters share many similarities in structure&lt;ref name="seeley"&gt;Seeley, Frank Friedberberg, ''Turgenev: A Reading of His Fiction'', 1991, Cambridge University Press, pp. 167-182&lt;/ref&gt; and all three characters are routinely referred to as ‘superfluous men’ (whether the term is applicable to all three has been a subject of scholarly debate).

For a long time, Turgenev was unsure of the genre of ''Rudin'', publishing it with a subtitle of ‘[[novella]]’. In 1860, it was published together with two other novels, but in the three editions of Turgenev's ''Works'' that followed it was grouped with short stories. In the final, 1880, edition it was again placed at the head of the novels.&lt;ref name="seeley"/&gt; The theme of the superfluous man in love was further explored in Turgenev's subsequent novels, culminating in ''Fathers and Sons''.

==Main characters==

===Dmitrii Nikolaevich Rudin===

[[File:Rudin 02 (Kardovsky).jpg|thumb|Rudin's first appearance at Lasunskaya's, by Dmitry Kardovsky]]

The main protagonist of the novel. Rudin is a well-educated, intellectual and extremely eloquent nobleman. His finances are in a poor state and he is dependent on others for his living. His father was a poor member of the [[gentry]] and died when Rudin was still very young. He was brought up by his mother who spent all the money she had on him, and was educated at [[Moscow University]] and abroad in Germany, at [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]] and [[Berlin University|Berlin]] (Turgenev himself studied in [[Berlin]]). When he first appears in the novel, he is described as follows: “A man of about thirty-five […] of a tall, somewhat stooping figure, with crisp curly hair and swarthy complexion, an irregular but expressive and intelligent face.[…] His clothes were not new, and were somewhat small, as though he had outgrown them.”&lt;ref name="rudin3"&gt;Turgenev, I., ''Rudin'' at [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/turgenev/ivan/t93r/chapter3.html The University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection], Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the novel he lives at Dar’ya Mikhailovna's estate and falls in love with her daughter, Natalya. This love is the main conflict of the novel. His eloquence earns him the respect of the estate's inhabitants, but several other characters display a strong dislike of him, and during the course of the novel it becomes apparent that he is “almost a Titan in word and a pigmy in deed”&lt;ref name="stepniak"&gt;Stepniak, S. ''Introduction to Rudin'' at [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/turgenev/ivan/t93r/introduction.html The University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; — that is, despite his eloquence he cannot accomplish what he talks of.

===Natal’ya Alekseevna Lasunskaya===

Also referred to as Natasha. Natasha is a seventeen-year-old daughter of Dar’ya Mikhailovna. She is observant, well-read and intelligent, but also quite secretive. While her mother thinks of her as a good-natured and well-mannered girl, she is not of a high opinion about her intelligence, and quite wrongly. She also thinks Natasha is ‘cold’, emotionless, but in the beginning of Chapter Five we are told by the narrator that “Her feelings were strong and deep, but reserved; even as a child she seldom cried, and now she seldom even sighed and only grew slightly pale when anything distressed her.”&lt;ref name="rudin5"&gt;Turgenev, I., ''Rudin'' at [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/turgenev/ivan/t93r/chapter5.html The University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection], Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; She engages in intellectual conversations with Rudin (which are not discouraged by her mother because she thinks that these conversations “improve her mind”); Natasha thinks highly of Rudin, who confides to her his ideas and “privately gives her books”, and soon falls in love with him. She also often compels him to apply his talents and act. Natasha is often thought of as the first of 'Turgenev maids' to feature in Turgenev's fiction.

===Dar’ya Mikhailovna Lasunskaya===
A female landowner at whose estate most of the events of the novel happen. She is the widow of a privy councillor, “a wealthy and distinguished lady”.&lt;ref name="rudin2"&gt;Turgenev, I., ''Rudin'' at [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/turgenev/ivan/t93r/chapter2.html The University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection], Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; While she is not very influential in [[St Petersburg]], let alone Europe, she is notorious in [[Moscow]] society as “a rather eccentric woman, not wholly good-natured, but excessively clever.”&lt;ref name="rudin2"/&gt; She is also described as a beauty in her youth, but “not a trace of her former charms remained.”&lt;ref name="rudin2"/&gt; She shuns the society of local female landowners, but receives many men. Rudin at first gains her favour, but she is very displeased when she finds out about Rudin's and Natasha's love. That said, her opinion of Natasha is far from being correct.

===Mihailo Mihailych Lezhnev===

A rich local landowner, generally thought to be a “queer creature” and described in Chapter One as having the appearance of “a huge sack of flour”.&lt;ref name="rudin1"&gt;Turgenev, I., ''Rudin'' at [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/turgenev/ivan/t93r/chapter1.html The University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection] Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Lezhnev is about thirty years old, and seldom visits Dar’ya Mikhailovna (more often than before as the novel progresses), but is often found at Aleksandra's Pavlovna Lipina's house; he is friends both with her and her brother, Sergei. He was orphaned at the age of seventeen, lived at his aunt's and studied together with Rudin at Moscow University, where they were members of the same group of intellectual young men and was good friends with him; he also knew him abroad, but began to dislike him there as “Rudin struck [Lezhnev] in his true light.”&lt;ref name="rudin6"&gt;Turgenev, I., ''Rudin'' at [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/turgenev/ivan/t93r/chapter6.html The University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection] Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; Lezhnev is in fact in love with Aleksandra and in the end marries her. His character is often contrasted to Rudin's as he is seen as everything a superfluous man is not – he is intelligent, but in a more practical way, and while he does not do anything exceptional, he doesn’t want to either. Seeley writes, that “he concentrates on doing the jobs that lie to hand – running his estate, raising a family – and these he does very competently. Beyond them he does not look.”&lt;ref name="seeley"/&gt; Lezhnev also acts as Rudin's [[biographer]] – he is the one who tells the reader about Rudin's life prior to his appearance at Dar’ya Mikhailovna's. He first describes Rudin in extremely unfavourable terms, but in the end he is also the one who admits Rudin's “genius” in certain areas of life.

===Aleksandra Pavlovna Lipina===

Also a local landowner, she is the first of major characters to be presented in the novel. She is described as “a widow, childless, and fairly well off”;&lt;ref name="rudin1"/&gt; we first see her visiting an ill peasant woman, and also find out that she maintains a [[hospital]]. She lives with her brother Sergei, who manages her estate, and visits Dar’ya Mikhailovna sometimes (less often as the novel progresses). Dar’ya Mikhailovna describes her as “a sweet creature […] a perfect child […] an absolute baby”,&lt;ref name="rudin4"&gt;Turgenev, I., ''Rudin'' at [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/turgenev/ivan/t93r/chapter4.html The University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection] Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; although the question remains of how well Dar’ya Mikhailovna can judge people. At first, she thinks very highly of Rudin and defends him against Lezhnev, but as the novel progresses she seems to side with his view of Rudin. In the end, she marries Lezhnev and seems to be an ideal partner for him.

===Sergei Pavlovich Volyntsev===

Aleksandra's brother. He is a retired [[cavalry]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] and manages his sister's estate. At the beginning of the novel he is a frequent guest at Dar’ya Mikhailovna's, because he is in love with Natasha. He takes a great dislike to Rudin, whom he sees as far too intelligent and, quite rightly, a dangerous rival. He is also slighted by Rudin when the latter comes to inform him of his mutual love with Natasha (with the best intentions). He is generally shown as a pleasant, if not very intellectual person, and is good friends with Lezhnev.

===Minor characters===

====Konstantin Diomidych Pandalevskii====

Dar’ya Mikhailovna's [[secretary]], a young man of affected manners. He is a [[flattery|flatterer]] and appears to be a generally dishonest and unpleasant person. He doesn’t appear to play an important role in the novel apart from being a satirical image.

====Afrikan Semenych Pigasov====

Described as “a strange person full of acerbity against everything and every one”,&lt;ref name="rudin2"/&gt; Pigasov frequently visits Dar’ya Mikhailovna prior to Rudin's appearance and amuses her with his bitter remarks, mostly aimed at women. Coming from a poor family, he educated himself, but never rose above the level of mediocrity. He failed his examination in public disputation, in government service he made a mistake which forced him to retire. His wife later left him and sold her estate, on which he just finished building a house, to a speculator. Since then he lived in the province. He is the first victim of Rudin's eloquence, as at Rudin's first appearance he challenged him to a debate and was defeated easily. He ends up living with Lezhnev and Aleksandra Pavlovna.

====Basistov====

Tutor to Dar’ya Mikhailovna's younger sons. He is completely captivated by Rudin and seems to be inspired by him. Basistov is the first example of an intellectual from the [[raznochinets]] background ([[Eugene Bazarov|Bazarov]] and [[Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov|Raskol’nikov]] are among later, more prominent fictional heroes from this background). He also serves as an example of how Rudin is not completely useless since he can inspire people such as Basistov, who can then act in a way impossible for Rudin.

==Synopsis==

===Rudin’s arrival===

The novel begins with the introduction of three of the characters – Aleksandra, Lezhnev, and Pandalevskii. Pandalevskii relates to Aleksandra Dar’ya Mikhailovna's invitation to come and meet a [[Baron]] Muffel’. Instead of the Baron, Rudin arrives and captivates everyone immediately with his intelligent and witty speeches during the argument with Pigasov. Rudin's arrival is delayed until Chapter Three. After his success at Dar’ya Mikhailovna's, he stays the night and the next morning meets Lezhnev who arrives to discuss some business affairs with Dar’ya Mikhailovna. This is the first time the reader finds out that Rudin and Lezhnev are acquainted, and studied together at [[university]]. During the day that follows Rudin has his first conversation with Natasha; as she speaks of him highly and says he “ought to work”, he replies with a lengthy speech. What follows is a description quite typical of Turgenev, where the character of Rudin is shown not through his own words, but through the text which underlines Rudin's contradictory statements:

:“Yes, I must act. I must not bury my talent, if I have any; I must not squander my powers on talk alone — empty, profitless talk — on mere words,’ and his words flowed in a stream. He spoke nobly, ardently, convincingly, of the sin of cowardice and indolence, of the necessity of action.”&lt;ref name="rudin5"/&gt;

On the same day, Sergei leaves Dar’ya Mikhailovna's early and arrives to see that Lezhnev is visiting. Lezhnev then gives his first description of Rudin.

===Rudin and Natasha===

[[File:Rudin 01 (Kardovsky).jpg|right|130px|thumb|Natasha leaves Rudin after their decisive encounter, by Dmitry Kardovsky]]

In two months, we are told, Rudin is still staying at Dar’ya Mikhailovna's, living off borrowed money. He spends a lot of time with Natasha; in a conversation with her he speaks of how an old love can only be replaced by a new one. At the same time, Lezhnev gives the account of his youth and his friendship with Rudin, making for the first time the point that Rudin is “too cold” and inactive. On the next day, Natasha quizzes Rudin over his words about old and new love. Neither she, nor he confess their love for each other but in the evening, Rudin and Natasha meet again, and this time Rudin confesses his love for her; Natasha replies that she, too, loves him. Unfortunately, their conversation is overheard by Pandalevskii, who reports it to Dar’ya Mikhailovna, and she strongly disapproves of this romance, making her feelings known to Natasha. The next time Natasha and Rudin meet, she tells him that Dar’ya Mikhailovna knows of their love and disapproves of it. Natasha wants to know what plan of action is Rudin going to propose, but he does not fulfil her expectations when he says that one must “submit to destiny”. She leaves him, disappointed and sad:

:“I am sad because I have been deceived in you… What! I come to you for counsel, and at such a moment! — and your first word is, submit! submit! So this is how you translate your talk of independence, of sacrifice, which …”&lt;ref name="rudin9"&gt;Turgenev, I., ''Rudin'' at [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/turgenev/ivan/t93r/chapter9.html The University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection], Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudin then leaves Dar’ya Mikhailovna's estate. Before his departure he writes two letters: one to Natasha and one to Sergei. The letter to Natasha is particularly notable in its confession of the vices of inactivity, inability to act and to take responsibility for one's actions – all the traits of a Hamlet which Turgenev later detailed in his 1860 speech. Lezhnev, meanwhile, asks Aleksandra to marry him and is accepted in a particularly fine scene.

===The Aftermath===
[[File:Rudin 03 (Kardovsky).jpg|thumb|220px|left|Rudin at the barricades, by Dmitry Kardovsky]]

Chapter Twelve and the Epilogue detail events of over two years past Rudin's arrival at Dar’ya Mikhailovna's estate. Lezhnev is happily married to Aleksandra. He arrives to give her news of Sergei's engagement to Natasha, who is said to “seem contented”. Pigasov lives with Lezhnevs, and amuses Aleksandra as he used to amuse Dar’ya Mikhailovna. A conversation which follows happens to touch on Rudin, and as Pigasov begins to make fun of him, Lezhnev stops him. He then defends Rudin's “genius” while saying that his problem is that he had no “character” in him. This, again, refers to the superfluous man's inability to act. He then toasts Rudin. The chapter ends with the description of Rudin travelling aimlessly around Russia. In the Epilogue, Lezhnev happens by chance to meet Rudin at a hotel in a provincial town. Lezhnev invites Rudin to dine with him, and over the dinner Rudin relates to Lezhnev his attempts to “act” – to improve an estate belonging to his friend, to make a river navigable, to become a teacher. In all three of this attempts Rudin demonstrated inability to adapt to the circumstances of Nicholas I's Russia, and subsequently failed, and was in the end banished to his estate. Lezhnev then appears to change his opinion of Rudin as inherently inactive, and says that Rudin failed exactly because he could never stop striving for truth. The Epilogue ends with Rudin's death at the barricades during the [[French Revolution of 1848]]; even at death he is mistaken by two fleeing revolutionaries for a [[Poles|Pole]].

== Adaptations ==
''Rudin'' was adapted for screen in 1976. The 95 minutes-long Soviet-made movie was directed by [[Konstantin Voynov]]. The cast included [[Oleg Yefremov]], [[Armen Dzhigarkhanyan]], and [[Rolan Bykov]].

'''Rufin Gavrilovich Sudkovsky''' (Ukrainian: Руфін Гаврилович Судковський; 19 April 1850, [[Ochakiv]] - 16 February 1885, Ochakiv) Was a Ukrainian painter who specialized in naval and [[Marine art|maritime]] scenes.

== Biography ==
He was the son of a priest in the Diocese of [[Kherson Governorate|Kherson]]. Originally, he planned to follow in his father's footsteps, studying first at the local religious school, then at the Odessa Theological Seminary,&lt;ref name="W"&gt;{{ВТ-ЭСБЕ|Судковский, Руфим Гаврилович}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he soon lost interest. He had been attracted to drawing since he was a child, and began to frequent the Odessa Drawing School at the local art society. Under the influence of Odessa's status as a major port, his focus soon turned to maritime themes. 
[[File:Sudkovsky 003.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Surf at the Pier (1879)]]
In 1868, he left the seminary and went to Saint Petersburg, where he was accepted on a provisional basis at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]]. He eventually became a full student, remaining for three years and being awarded several medals. He returned to Ochakiv in 1871 and began a series of sketches of the [[Black Sea]] coastline.&lt;ref name="W" /&gt; Most of these early works were derivative, and were not successful when they were exhibited in Saint Petersburg. His technique and originality improved during a trip to Germany and France in 1874.&lt;ref name="I"&gt;[http://imperiaikon.ru/poleznaya_informaciya/katalog_hudozhnikov/s/sya_mgnoveniya_zdravstvujte_gost_nastroit_katalog_portal_blogi_knigi_znaniya_shkola_menyu_kartiny_foto_vsego_kartin_2463_russkay/ Brief biography] @ Imperia.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, a new exhibit at the Academy earned him the title of "Free Artist" (second degree). In 1879, he was promoted to first degree.&lt;ref name="W" /&gt; 
[[File:Sudkovsky 007.jpg|thumb|185px|[[Darial Gorge]] (1884)]]

===Plagiarism?===
He continued to exhibit in Saint Petersburg, sometimes together with [[Julius von Klever]].&lt;ref name="I" /&gt; In 1882, his painting, "Tempest near Ochakiv", won him the title of Academician. The following year, he was married and became embroiled in a controversy when [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]] (a former roommate at the Academy) accused him of plagiarism. Although the critics and press took his side, several artists ([[Ivan Kramskoi|Kramskoi]], [[Vassily Maximov|Maximov]], [[Yefim Volkov|Volkov]] and [[Ilya Repin|Repin]]) published a letter in the ''[[Novoye Vremya (newspaper)|New Times]]'', stating that Sudovsky had "directly borrowed" from Kuindzhi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum-painting.dp.ua/ru/painters/painters-ukraine/khudozhniki-ukrainy-xix-nachala-xx-vv/sudkovskij-rufin-rufim-gavrilovich.html Brief biography] @ the Museum of Ukrainian Art, [[Dnipropetrovsk]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, at the height of his career, he fell ill with [[typhus]] during an exhibition in Kiev, and was taken back to Ochakiv, where he died.&lt;ref name="I" /&gt; Despite his short life, he was able to complete a large number of canvases, which were presented by his friends in a retrospective,  shortly after his death. His widow, [[Elena Samokysh-Sudkovskaya|Elena]] (also an artist), married the military painter, [[Mykola Samokysh]] in 1889 and became a popular illustrator.&lt;ref name="I" /&gt;

{{refimprove|date=April 2012}}

A '''secret history''' (or '''shadow history''') is a [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] interpretation of either fictional or real [[history]] which is claimed to have been deliberately suppressed, forgotten, or ignored by established scholars. "Secret history" is also used to describe an alternative interpretation of documented facts which portrays a drastically different motivation or history from established historical events.

==Secret histories of the real world==
{{main article|Historical revisionism}}
Originally, secret histories were designed as non-fictional, revealing or claiming to reveal the truth behind the "[[Spin (public relations)|spin]]": one such example is ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]''. Secret histories can range from standard [[historical revisionism]] with proper critical reexamination of historical facts to [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|negative historical revisionism]] wherein facts are deliberately omitted, [[suppression of dissent|suppressed]] or distorted.

The quintessential example secret history is the ''[[Procopius#Secret History|Anecdota]]'' of [[Procopius of Caesarea]] (known for centuries as the ''Secret History''). It was discovered, centuries after it was written, in the [[Vatican Library]] and published in 1623, although its existence was already known from the ''[[Suda]]'', which referred to it as the ''Anekdota'' ("the unpublished composition"). The ''Secret History'' covers roughly the same years as the first seven books of the ''History of Justinian's Wars'' and appears to have been written after they were published. Current consensus generally dates it to 550 or 558, possibly as late as 562. It portrays the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Justinian I]] to the great disadvantage of the Emperor, the Emperor's wife, and some of his imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Procopius/Anecdota/home.html The Secret History], English translation (Dewing, 1935) at [[LacusCurtius]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional secret histories==
Secret history is sometimes used in a long-running [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] universe to preserve [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] with the present by reconciling [[paranormal]], [[anachronistic]], or otherwise notable but unrecorded events with what actually happened in known history; for instance, in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe, [[Greg Cox (writer)|Greg Cox]]'s novels ''[[The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh]]'' cast the devastating [[Eugenics Wars]] of the 1990s (still well into the future when first mentioned in an episode from 1967) as shadow wars most people never knew about, in which such real-life events from that era as the [[Smiling Buddha]] nuclear test, the [[Yugoslav Wars]] during the 1990s, and the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] were all part of one wider conflict.

===Secret history thrillers===
A certain type of [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] can be defined as secret history. In such novels, a daring spy, assassin or commando ''nearly'' carries out a coup which would have drastically changed history as we know it. Since this is not [[alternate history]] but a secret event in our own history, the reader knows in advance that this attempt would be foiled, that all persons in the know would be sworn to secrecy and all evidence be consigned to a top secret archive, where supposedly it still is. Nevertheless, the plot fascinates many readers who want to see how close history comes to being changed (usually very, very close) and exactly how the attempt would be foiled.

Two highly successful novels are considered to have started this subgenre:

* ''[[Eye of the Needle (novel)|Eye of the Needle]]'' by [[Ken Follett]]: a German spy in 1944 nearly succeeds in foiling [[D-Day]];
* ''[[The Day of the Jackal]]'' by [[Frederick Forsyth]]: an assassin nearly succeeds in killing [[Charles De Gaulle]], president of France, in 1963.

These two novels set the framework for many later books: following step by step both the fiendishly clever, competent and ruthless perpetrator in carrying out his design and the equally clever and competent hunter, hot on his heels throughout the book, but who would catch up with him only at the very end. Typically, historical figures – including very famous ones – appear in some key scenes, but are not major actors.

Many other novels of this type followed, most of them with [[World War II]] backgrounds. Follet himself published at least two others:
* ''[[The Key to Rebecca]]'': a German spy in [[Cairo]] nearly succeeds in letting [[Erwin Rommel]] win at [[El Alamein]].
* ''[[The Man from St. Petersburg]]'': a [[Russian anarchist]] in 1914 Britain nearly succeeds, by assassinating a key envoy of the Tsar, in averting the [[First World War]].

Works of other writers fitting within this type include:
* ''[[Enigma (novel)|Enigma]]'' by [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]: an embittered code-breaker nearly betrays to Nazi Germany the vital and closely guarded secret that the Allies are able to read its secret messages.
* ''[[The Eagle Has Landed (novel)|The Eagle Has Landed]]'' by [[Jack Higgins]]: German commandos nearly succeed in kidnapping British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] out of wartime England.
* ''[[The Romanov Succession]]'' by [[Brian Garfield]]: taking advantage of the 1941 Nazi attack on the Soviet Union, [[Russia]]n exiles attempt to assassinate Soviet premier [[Joseph Stalin]] and restore the monarchy.
* ''[[The Night Letter]]'' by [[Paul Spike]]: In 1940, Nazi agents nearly succeed in blackmailing U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] into not running for a third term.
* ''[[The Ninth Man]]'' by [[John Lee (author)|John Lee]]: a few years later, a Nazi agent penetrates the White House and nearly succeeds in assassinating Roosevelt.
* ''[[Stalag Texas]]'', also by [[John Lee (author)|John Lee]]: escaped German prisoners nearly succeed in destroying the American nuclear laboratory at [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]].
* ''An Exchange of Eagles'' by [[Owen Sela]]: In 1940, senior officers of the German [[Abwehr]] and the [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army) |American Military Intelligence]] make a secret deal to simultaneously assassinate [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] with the assumption that they would be replaced by [[Hermann Göring]] and [[Henry A. Wallace]] - who would make peace and prevent World War II from further escalating.
* In the 2006 [[historical detective]] novel, ''[[The Janissary Tree]]'' by [[Jason Goodwin]], a power-mad [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] general in 1836 nearly succeeds in overthrowing Sultan [[Mehmet II]] and proclaiming a republic almost 90 years in advance of [[Ataturk]].
* In the thriller ''[[The Redbreast]]'' by [[Jo Nesbø]], a former World War II Norwegian collaborator with the Nazi occupation nearly succeeds in assassinating the Norwegian Crown Prince.

Different types of secret history thriller include:

* ''[[The Leader and the Damned]]'' by [[Colin Forbes (novelist)|Colin Forbes]]: [[Adolf Hitler]] was assassinated in 1943 but his death was kept secret and the man who led Nazi Germany in the last two years of the war was a [[Look-alike|double]]. This book also provides a detailed view on the role of [[Martin Bormann]] in the Nazi leadership and of his eventual fate, completely at odds with the official historical record. 
* ''[[XPD]]'' by [[Len Deighton]]: [[Winston Churchill]] was far more of an [[appeaser]] than official history records, and in June 1940 he had a secret meeting with Hitler to discuss peace on the basis of recognizing the German domination of Europe; decades later, the documents recording this shameful secret are the subject of an intensive and deadly power struggle.
* The mystery series by [[Elliott Roosevelt]] in which his mother, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], is the detective – placing murder mysteries in the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] White House and other actual locations and involving many historical persons in the fictional events depicted. In one book of the series, ''[[Murder at the Chateau]]'', Eleanor Roosevelt is involved not only in a murder mystery but also in a high-level secret conference in Occupied France, which nearly ends with a diplomatic deal to end World War II in 1941.
* ''[[The Berkut]]'' by Joseph Heywood. [[Adolf Hitler]] did not really commit suicide in 1945, it was a double who died together with [[Eva Braun]]. The real Hitler tried to escape from Berlin, was captured by Soviet commandos after the long chase making most of the book, and was secretly kept under horrible and degrading conditions in the [[Kremlin]] basement until the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953, when he was secretly executed.
* Many of the "Blackford Oakes" spy novels, by conservative writer William F. Buckley, Jr., which are secret-history thrillers claiming that historical events considered to have been setbacks for the United States were actually brilliant strategic coups by the CIA which were merely allowed to look like defeats for security purposes, or at least were the product of the US's moral superiority. For instance, in ''[[Who's on First (novel)|Who's on First]]'', Oakes deliberately chooses not to stop the Soviet Union from launching [[Sputnik]] ahead of the otherwise-superior US satellite program, in order to protect the life of a Soviet contact (and thus the seeming Soviet technological triumph was actually authorized by a US agent, who allowed it to happen); in ''[[Marco Polo, if You Can]]'', Oakes is the real-life [[U2]] pilot [[Gary Powers]], and allows himself to be captured while flying over the Soviet Union in order to create a cover story for a secret US intelligence operation (and thus the [[U2 incident]] was actually planned from the start, [[Gary Powers]] was not shot down by the Soviet military but deliberately set up his own capture, and U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s subsequent humiliation by Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] never happened).
* The plot of [[Clive Cussler]]'s ''[[Night Probe!]]'' is based on the assumption that on the eve of [[World War I]] in 1914, a secret treaty was signed between the British Prime Minister, [[H. H. Asquith]], with the cooperation of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], and US President [[Woodrow Wilson]] – to sell [[Canada]] to the United States for the sum of one billion dollars. The treaty was aborted at the time and reference to it erased from all official records – to resurface explosively in 1989 (as future date at the time of writing).
* An interesting example of a science-fiction secret history novel can be found in the [[BBC]] ''[[Doctor Who]]'' [[Past Doctor Adventures]] novel ''[[Imperial Moon]]'', which sees the [[Fifth Doctor]] and his companions [[Vislor Turlough]] and [[Kamelion]] learn about a secret trip to the Moon by the British Imperial Spacefleet in 1878. On first hearing of the expedition, the Doctor notes that Victorian science could have built a structurally sound spaceship capable of going to the Moon, with the only thing beyond them being a conventional propulsion system; the events of the novel reveal that information about how to create the ships' engines was secretly provided by an alien race trapped on the Moon who sought to escape to Earth. At the novel's conclusion, after the alien race decimates the spaceport where the ships returned to Earth before being defeated by the Doctor and his companions, the Doctor arranges for Queen Victoria to cancel the space program as he recognises that Victorian Britain is not psychologically ready to travel in space, with all records of the expedition being destroyed apart from the expedition leader's diary, which he entrusts to the Doctor for safe keeping.
* Another example of a science-fiction secret history is ''[[The Proteus Operation]]'' by [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]]. Its plot tells the most closely guarded secret of [[World War II]]: in 1939 there arrived in New York City a group of time-travelers from a future timeline in which the Nazis won the war and took over most of the world. The arrivals secretly contacted [[Franklin Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]] and provided invaluable  information about how the Germans won in their history – which enabled the Allies to do better this time and win the war. This time-travel secret was only known to  Roosevelt and Churchill, to a few of their close advisers such as [[Harry Hopkins]], and to a few scientists such as [[Einstein]]. After the victory in 1945, all who knew it were sworn to secrecy – and strictly kept it until their deaths – and all records destroyed, this secret considered too explosive to be ever told.
* [[James A. Hetley]]'s [[Contemporary Fantasy]] books ''Dragon's Eye'' and ''Dragon's Teeth'' are based on the assumption that in the Fourteenth Century several boatloads of rebellious [[Welsh people|Welsh]], opposing the [[Wales in the Late Middle Ages| English conquest of their homeland]], secretly crossed the Atlantic and established themselves at what would become the State of [[Maine]]. Being not very numerous and not the harbingers of further immigrants, they were able to reach a reasonable accommodation with the matrilineal leadership of the local [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribe. Centuries later they blended with later European immigrants, stating truthfully that their name was Morgan and that they were of Welsh origin, while being vague on when they had come to America. In the 17th and 18th Century they were involved in piracy, later shifted to other lucrative (and highly illegal) activities. By the present time, the Welsh Morgans along with the Native American Haskells are still the two leading families of Stonefort, Maine. In their well-guarded home are preserved various artifacts of their ancestors, and manuscripts in Medieval Latin and Welsh  - which historians would have loved to see, but the Morgans prefer not to share them with outsiders.

===Fictional "secret" versions of historical events===
* [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]]' last major work, ''[[The Knight of Sainte-Hermine]]'' asserts that it was the novel's protagonist who killed the British Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] and that the true circumstances of Nelson's death were kept secret for reasons which form part of the book's plot. 
* Dumas' earlier and more well-known work, ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'', provides a detailed and entirely fictional account of the background to the 1628 assassination of [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]] by the junior officer [[John Felton (assassin)#In fiction| John Felton]]. At the time and up to the present, Felton's act was considered as part of the turbulent 17th Century English politics. As depicted by Dumas, however, the assassination of Buckingham was the result of a convoluted plot hatched by the French [[Cardinal Richelieu]], while Felton himself was unaware of being manipulated by Richelieu's female agent. 
* [[Elizabeth Bear]]'s "Promethean Age" series constitutes a massive secret history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Monette|first=Sarah|title=An Interview with Elizabeth Bear, conducted by Sarah Monette|url=https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Elizabeth+Bear%27s+%22Promethean+Age%22&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;start=0#hl=en&amp;sugexp=les%3B&amp;gs_nf=1&amp;tok=fGCbg3M4XX5PLux3JCZiJA&amp;pq=elizabeth%20bear%27s%20%22promethean%20age%22%20%22secret%20history%22%20review&amp;cp=51&amp;gs_id=iw&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=Elizabeth+Bear%27s+%22Promethean+Age%22+%22secret+history%22&amp;pf=p&amp;safe=off&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;oq=Elizabeth+Bear%27s+%22Promethean+Age%22+%22secret+history%22+&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=22adff2dc2288598&amp;biw=840&amp;bih=359&amp;bs=1|publisher=Subterranean Press|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Elizabethan]] England, with considerable [[fantasy]] elements. Among other things the series asserts that [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]] was a secret illegitimate son of [[Queen Elizabeth I]]; that Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], the Queen's spymaster, did not die in 1590 as history records but lived in secret for another five years; that playwrights [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Ben Jonson]] were all secret agents of the Queen and underwent dangerous missions in her service, in addition to their theatrical activities; that the plays of all three had profound secret political and magical meanings; that Shakespeare and Marlowe were lovers, and homoerotic elements in [[Shakespeare's Sonnets]] were dedicated to Marlowe; that [[Edmund Spencer]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' was not a fictional work but was based on a true Kingdom of Faerie, whose Queen had a secret pact of mutual help with the English Queen Elizabeth; that Christopher Marlowe was not assassinated in 1593 as history records but was taken into Faerie where he became the lover of the witch [[Morgan le Fay]]; and that Shakespeare had also visited Faerie and personally met with [[Puck (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Puck]] and other supposedly legendary characters depicted in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.
* The [[The Black Adder|first series]] of ''[[Blackadder]]'', in which [[Henry VII of England]] comes to power in a completely different way and removes the reign of "Richard IV" from the history books.  Note that in recorded history England had only three kings named Richard.
*The ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' video game franchise is built around a conspiracy-laden story involving a "[[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]]" organization that originated with the [[Knights Templar]]. According to the game's fiction, many historical figures were secretly Templars, manipulating history and those around them in a quest for power. They were opposed by the Assassins, another secret order that considered themselves defenders of humanity's free will. It is implied, and confirmed in ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]'', that certain powerful artifacts that the Templars sought in their quest for power were remnants of a secret "First Civilization", the basis for most real-world religion and mythology. The true history of the world has long been lost and/or intentionally obscured, possibly by the Templars.
* The background of [[Ben Aaronovitch]]'s ''[[Rivers of London (novel)|Rivers of London]]'' series of [[contemporary fantasy]] detective thrillers includes the assertion that [[Isaac Newton]], in addition to his well-known scientific achievements, was also a powerful [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] who codified the basic principles of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Unlike Newton's writings on other subjects, his ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Artes Magicis'' ([[Latin]] for "Natural Philosophy Principles of The Magical Arts") was never made known to the general public. However, copies of Newton's book, as of other books on magic, were kept at a secret section of the [[Bodleian Library]] in the [[University of Oxford]], and it remained the basic text for practitioners of magic into the twenty-first century. The same series also assumes that, in addition to the various weapons deployed, [[World War II]] had also been fought by magical means, with [[Nazi Germany]], [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|Britain]], the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] each raising its own secret corps of warrior-wizards. Specifically, official World War II histories omit all mention of a major battle fought on January 1945 at Ettersberg, Germany – where thousands of British wizards gave their lives in the effort to destroy a secret magical facility, from where Nazi wizards were seeking to unleash [[vampire]]s and other nasty magical surprises upon the world. Scattered in the series are minor other tidbits of secret history: The practice of magic flourished among the court ladies of [[Caroline of Ansbach]]; during the [[War of 1812]] British wizards trained [[Tecumseh]]'s [[medicine men]] in up to date Newtonian magic, for which American wizards kept a grudge even centuries later; [[Maynard Keynes]], though not practicing magic himself, was associated with the British wizards and helped them locate various magical manuscripts; in 2009, American wizards trying a magical operation as part of the [[Iraq War]] suffered a major fiasco at [[Falluja]] which was covered up but got their contract with the US Army terminated.  
* [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[Baudolino]]'' suggests that Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], who died while on the [[Second Crusade]], had not drowned in a river, as history records. Rather, he had died mysteriously at night while hosted at the castle of a sinister Armenian noble. According to the book, the only people who knew the truth had an excellent reason to hide it - since they had been in charge of guarding the Emperor, and if the truth became known they might have been executed out of hand for failing in their task.
* Gore Vidal's novel "Creation", purporting to disclose many facts on Greek-Persian Wars that were not known to Herodotus, asserts that the Persian King Darius planned a major military campaign in India, with the aim of annexing the entire Gangetic Plain to the Persian Empire. But the Greeks, entagling the Persians in a major war on their other flank and proving a tougher opponent than the Persian counted on, caused that Indian campaign to be aborted.  Thus, according to Vidal, the Greeks unknowingly greatly influenced India's history and - since this was the Buddha's lifetime - also the character of Buddhism, a major world religion.

* The books of [[Steve Berry (novelist)|Steve Berry]] often have secret history elements which are critical to their plots. For example, ''The Jefferson Key'', part of Berry's [[Cotton Malone]] series, is based on the assumption that all four assassinations of a US President ([[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1865, [[James A. Garfield]] in 1881,[[William McKinley]] in 1901 and [[John Kennedy]] in 1963) were in fact organized by a secret "Commonwealth" of pirates (or "privateers"), founded during the American Revolution, which still exists into the 21st Century and wields considerable power behind the scenes, and whose lucrative activities were in one way or another disrupted by each of these four Presidents. The pirates had, in each case, located a person who had a reason to hate the President and manipulated him into unknowingly carrying out their design. Other Presidents, like [[Woodrow Wilson]] during WWI and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in WWII, knew of this Commonwealth, recognized its secret role and made secret use of it - and thus avoided being assassinated. The book's plot hinges on a page torn from the Congressional Record, confirming that Congress in the early years of the US did give  this Commonwealth "a perpetual authorization" to act as [[privateer]]s. Once the current President's agent has located and destroyed this document, ensuring that this piece of secret history will remain forever secret, the President is free to act decisively and break up the pirate Commonwealth. Other Steve Berry books feature such pieces of secret history as Treasure hidden by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], secret survivals of the [[Knights Templar]] and the fate of the books of the [[Alexandrine Library]].

==Secret histories of fictional worlds==
"[[Retcon]]", alteration of the [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] account of past events in serial fiction, often employs aspects of secret history. A seeming [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] breach might be "revealed" to alter the truth of what readers were previously led to believe was a definitive story. A retcon might equally well convert an established history into a secret history. Such transformations occur with particular frequency in long-running [[superhero]] comic books.

===Examples===
* When [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] wrote ''[[The Final Problem]]'' he fully intended to kill off [[Sherlock Holmes]] and write no further books and stories about him. Faced with massive pressure and protests by the famous detective's fans, he finally gave in. "[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]" revealed that Holmes did not die after all, and recounted a secret history of three years in which Holmes had been wandering the world while everybody – including even his close friend Dr. Watson – believed him to be dead. What differentiates this case from many other retcons and reboots is the fact that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle did not need to alter the initial stories in any ways, since he had never given any substantial evidence that Sherlock Holmes died, in the first place : the "death" of the Great Detective was only a mistake on the part of the police and Dr Watson who misread the signs on the place of his apparent death.
* The ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'' also alludes to hidden ''fictional'' history, establishing that during the events of the serial ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'', the [[First Doctor]] had in his possession a super-weapon, the [[Hand of Omega]] stolen from his own people, the [[Time Lord]]s. The story also implies that he knew of the [[Daleks]] before he "first" met them.
* [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' made years of "established" events and characters from the [[DC Universe]] (for example the existence of [[Krypto]]) "un-happen". In the revised continuity only a few privileged characters remember the old continuity, making it "secret".
* [[Philip Jose Farmer]]'s [[Wold Newton family|Wold Newton]] universe heavily influenced Alan Moore's subsequent ''[[League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''. Both these universes tie together many disparate fictional creations in a variety of surprising ways.
* [[Warren Ellis]]'s comic book series ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]'' offers a secret history look at the origin of comic book and literary type superheroes.
* [[Philip José Farmer]]'s ''[[The Other Log of Phileas Fogg]]'' reinterprets [[Jules Verne]]'s famous tale with the assumption that in fact Fogg was the immortal foster child of a race of hominid aliens known as the Eridani, and that his travel around the world was part of a secret mission on their behalf.
* Many of the novels by American [[Tim Powers]] are secret histories. For example, his 1987 novel ''[[On Stranger Tides]]'' had a different interpretation of pirate [[Blackbeard]]'s death at Ocracoke Inlet. After finding the [[Fountain of Youth]], Blackbeard planned to go in battle and knew it would lead to his death, which he wanted to be a widely known event. After Blackbeard's death, his head was severed and hung on the bowsprit, in which the pirate's blood fell into the sea, thereby letting the effects of the Fountain work. Blackbeard's soul would gain a new body, where he would assume a new identity as "Edmund Morcilla" until he was killed again, for once and all, by the book's protagonist, Jack Shandy. Powers's 2001 novel ''[[Declare]]'' presents a secret history of the Cold War, with America and the U.K. jousting with the Soviet Union over the control of powerful supernatural forces.

==Time travel secret histories==

The plots of some [[Time travel]] books and stories make it possible to count them as secret histories as well – since they posit that the truth about various historical figures and events is quite different from what history books recount.

For example, [[Poul Anderson]]'s story "Brave to be a King" asserts that King [[Cyrus the Great]], founder of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], was in fact a twentieth-century American time traveler stranded in the past who became a King by strange circumstances. (However, this is "cancelled out" at the end of the story, when the real Cyrus is restored to the timeline, and the American goes home to his own century.) Another Anderson story, "The Sorrow of Odin the Goth", asserts that also the Nordic god [[Odin]]/[[Wodan]] was a twentieth-century American time traveler, who sought to study the culture of the ancient [[Goths]] and ended up being regarded as a god and starting an enduring myth. 

[[Paul Levinson]]'s "[[The Plot to Save Socrates]]" asserts (as its title suggests), that the philosopher [[Socrates]] did not drink hemlock, as history tells. Rather, a clone died in his place and the true Socrates lived some more years in Twenty First Century America. Also according to the same book, the politician and general [[Alcibiades]] had a long life and many adventures after the moment when history records his death; Alcibiades' mistress Timandra and the famous  fourth-century  mathematician [[Hypatia]] of [[History of Alexandria#Late Roman and Byzantine period|Alexandria]] were one and the same person, a time-traveling American woman; the inventor [[Hero of Alexandria]] was also an American time traveler; and finally, according to the same book, the  nineteenth-century publisher [[William Henry Appleton]] had an extensive secret life as a time traveler, had visited [[Classical Greece]] and met some of the famous ancient Greek writers and philosophers whose works he published, and also several times visited the twenty-first century – but always found his own nineteenth-century milieu to be the most congenial.

According to [[David Drake]]'s novel "[[Birds of Prey (Drake novel)|Birds of Prey]]", the [[Roman Empire]]'s [[Third Century Crisis]] was far more severe than modern historians realize, and the Empire was on the verge of final collapse and disintegration already then. The situation was saved by a time traveler from the very far future, endowed with telepathic and other superhuman powers. That traveler encountered a young junior Roman officer named [[Diocletian]], realized his enormous potential and gave him the final push to eventually become a strong Emperor, revive and restructure the Roman Empire and give it another two hundred years of life (and much longer for its Eastern portion). Diocletian himself was completely unaware of this crucial help to his career.

[[Ray Nelson]]'s novel ''Bĺake's Progress'' assumes that the poet [[William Blake]] and his wife [[Catherine Blake| Kate]] were accomplished time travelers who had many adventures in past and future times and in various [[alternate timeline]]s, their actions profoundly effecting the course of human history. They had a child never known to recorded history, since the child - also a time traveler - was born in the distant past and lived out his life in the distant future. While it is well-known that Blake revered the poetry of [[John Milton]], the book discloses that the two of them often met personally - the century separating them being no hindrance since Milton, too, was a time traveler and both could travel freely over millions of years. [[William Blake's mythology]] is not fictional but features actual people - or beings - whom  Blake met on his wanderings through time. The character [[Urizen]] was in fact Blake's own son, born of a relationship with a woman of the far future. In addition to all the above, the book makes the more mundane assertion that many of the engravings attributed to Blake were in fact made by Kate and that in fact she was the better engraver of the two.

'''''Self-Portrait with a Harp''''' is a 1791 painting ([[Self-portrait|self-portrait]]) by [[Rose-Adélaïde Ducreux]]. It is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name="Met" &gt;{{cite web|title=Self-Portrait with a Harp|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436222|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history and creation==
Rose-Adélaïde Ducreux, daughter of [[Joseph Ducreux]], portraitist of [[Marie Antoinette]], was trained by her father. Because the family were not members of the [[Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture]] exhibiting works at the official [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] was barred prior to the [[French Revolution]]. In 1791, the Salon became open to other artists&lt;ref name="Barnard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Portraits: Rose Decreux—Self-Portrait with Harp 1791|url=http://bt.barnard.edu/avirtualenlightenment/project3/2015/04/04/portraits/|website=Barnard Teaches|publisher=[[Barnard College]]|accessdate=1 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715040435/http://bt.barnard.edu/avirtualenlightenment/project3/2015/04/04/portraits/|archivedate=15 July 2016|location=New York City, New York|date=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Self-Portrait with a Harp'' was first displayed in a joint debut with her father in the Salon of the [[Louvre]] that year. It was one of two paintings exhibited by Ducreux.&lt;ref name="NMWA" &gt;{{cite web|title=Royalists to Romantics: Spotlight on Rose Adélaïde Ducreux|url=https://nmwa.org/blog/2012/05/15/royalists-to-romantics-spotlight-on-rose-adelaide-ducreux/|website=National Museum of Women in the Arts|accessdate=1 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307074827/https://nmwa.org/blog/2012/05/15/royalists-to-romantics-spotlight-on-rose-adelaide-ducreux/|archivedate=7 March 2017|location=Washington, D.C.|date=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Later history and display==
The painting was shown in an exhibit entitled "Selection of Works by French and English Painters of the Eighteenth Century" hosted by the Art Gallery of the Corporation of London between 22 April and 26 July 1902. After the exhibition, the painting was sold and went into the private collection of David H. King Jr. in 1905 and remained until 1938 when it was sold to Susan Dwight Bliss.&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt;
 
==Description and interpretation==
The work depicts Rose-Adélaïde Ducreux, who was often the subject of her artistic works. Because the career of painter was uncommon for women and perceived as a masculine endeavor, it was not a widely accepted occupation at the time. Female artists frequently used themselves as a subject, creating a persona of femininity. By employing her beauty, talent and charm, Ducreux captured the traits society valued for women in her era.&lt;ref name="Barnard" /&gt; Painted in a [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical style]], the image is a life-sized, standing portrait of the artist playing a [[harp]].&lt;ref name="NMWA" /&gt; The instrument, is depicted as a prop for the splendor of the female form draped in a luxurious, silk gown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Donovan|first=Julie |title=Sydney Owenson, Lady Morgan and the Politics of Style|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_hFUsDGe8TYC&amp;pg=PA110|year=2009|publisher=Academica Press, LLC|location=Bethesda, Maryland|isbn=978-1-933146-55-3|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting the artist's refinement. In addition to her youthful beauty, her enlightenment is enhanced by the presence of a novel, her skill with music, and a decorative vase on a nearby table.&lt;ref name="Barnard" /&gt;

A '''sin-eater''' is a person who consumes a ritual meal in order to [[Magic (supernatural)|magically]] take on the [[sin]]s of a person or household. The food was believed to absorb the sins of a recently deceased person, thus [[Absolution of the dead|absolving]] the soul of the person. Sin-eaters, as a consequence,  carried the sins of all people whose sins they had eaten. [[Cultural anthropologists]] and [[folklorist]]s classify sin-eating as a form of [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] [[ritual]]&lt;ref name="Davidson 1993p85"&gt;[[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] (1993) [https://books.google.com/books?id=QHPYAAAAMAAJ ''Boundaries &amp; Thresholds''] p.85 quotation: {{quotation|It is this fear of what the dead in their uncontrollable power might cause which has brought forth apotropaic rites, protective rites against the dead. [...] One of these popular rites was the funeral rite of sin-eating, performed by a sin-eater, a man or woman. Through accepting the food and drink provided, he took upon himself the sins of the departed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[magic and religion|religious magic]].

==History==
Although the figure of the sin-eater has had various references in modern culture, the questions of how common the practice was, what regions of the world in which it was most common, and what the interactions between sin-eaters, common people, and religious authorities were, remain largely unstudied and in the realm of folklore.

In mythology, [[Tlazolteotl]], the Aztec goddess of earth, motherhood and fertility, had a redemptive role in the religious practices of the [[Meso-American]] civilization.  At the end of an individual's life, he was allowed to confess his misdeeds to this deity, and according to legend she would cleanse his soul by "eating its filth".

[[Jesus of Nazareth]] has been interpreted as a universal archetype for sin-eaters, offering his life to atone or purify all of humanity of their sins.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{cite book|last=Walford Davies, Richard Marggraf Turley |first=Damian |title=The Monstrous Debt: Modalities of Romantic Influence in Twentieth-century Literature|year=2006 |publisher=Wayne State University |isbn=0814330584 |page=19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVh_qVyFt6kC&amp;d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Bagford]], (ca.1650–1716) includes the following description of the sin-eating ritual in his ''letter on Leland’s Collectanea'', i. 76. (as cited in [[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]], 1898)
{{quote|Notice was given to an old sire before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with a cricket [low stool], on which he sat down facing the door; then they gave him a groat which he put in his pocket, a crust of bread which he ate, and a bowl of ale which he drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket and pronounced the case and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul.}}

A local legend in [[Shropshire]], [[England]], concerns the grave of Richard Munslow, who died in 1906, said to be the last sin-eater of the area:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-11360659 | title=Last 'sin-eater' to be celebrated with church service | date=19 September 2010 | accessdate=2010-09-19 | work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|By eating bread and drinking ale, and by making a short speech at the graveside, the sin-eater took upon themselves the sins of the deceased". The speech was written as: "I give easement and rest now to thee, dear man. Come not down the lanes or in our meadows. And for thy peace I pawn my own soul. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shropshiregallery.co.uk/towns/ratlinghope/ratlinghope.html The Sin Eaters' Grave at Ratlinghope] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208141333/http://www.shropshiregallery.co.uk/towns/ratlinghope/ratlinghope.html |date=8 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 1926 book ''Funeral Customs'' by [[Bertram S. Puckle]] mentions the sin-eater:
{{quote|Professor Evans of the Presbyterian College, Carmarthen, actually saw a sin-eater about the year 1825, who was then living near [[Llanwenog]], [[Ceredigion|Cardiganshire]]. Abhorred by the superstitious villagers as a thing unclean, the sin-eater cut himself off from all social intercourse with his fellow creatures by reason of the life he had chosen; he lived as a rule in a remote place by himself, and those who chanced to meet him avoided him as they would a leper. This unfortunate was held to be the associate of [[evil spirits]], and given to [[witchcraft]], incantations and unholy practices; only when a death took place did they seek him out, and when his purpose was accomplished they burned the wooden bowl and platter from which he had eaten the food handed across, or placed on the corpse for his consumption.&lt;ref name="sacred"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/etc/fcod/fcod07.htm SacredTexts.com: Food]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Howlett mentions sin-eating as an old custom in [[Hereford]], and thus describes the practice: "The corpse being taken out of the house, and laid on a bier, a loaf of bread was given to the sin-eater over the corpse, also a maga-bowl of maple, full of beer. These consumed, a fee of sixpence was given him for the consideration of his taking upon himself the sins of the deceased, who, thus freed, would not walk after death."

The [[Britannica 1911|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] states in its article on "sin eaters":
{{quote|A symbolic survival of it (''sin eating'') was witnessed as recently as 1893 at Market Drayton, [[Shropshire]]. After a preliminary service had been held over the coffin in the house, a woman poured out a glass of wine for each bearer and handed it to him across the coffin with a 'funeral biscuit.' In Upper [[Bavaria]] sin-eating still survives: a corpse cake is placed on the breast of the dead and then eaten by the nearest relative, while in the [[Balkan peninsula]] a small bread image of the deceased is made and eaten by the survivors of the family. The Dutch doed-koecks or '[[dead-cakes]]', marked with the initials of the deceased, introduced into America in the 17th century, were long given to the attendants at funerals in old [[New York (state)|New York]]. The 'burial-cakes' which are still made in parts of rural England, for example [[Lincolnshire]] and [[Cumberland]], are almost certainly a relic of sin-eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911||wstitle=Sin-eater|volume=25|pages=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Sonic Boom Six''' (often shortened to '''SB6''') are a five-piece band from [[Manchester]], United Kingdom. Their eclectic sound combines different elements of several genres and has been described by [[Kerrang!]] as "taking [[ska]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[grime (music)|grime]], [[dubstep]], [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] apart, then rebuilding them as a hyperactive hybrid".&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.bandzoogle.com/users/sonicboomsix/files/KERRANG-REVIEW-APRIL-2011.jpg Kerrang! Magazine April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Their lyrics tend to focus on social commentary with a live show known for "clashing activism and good times".&lt;ref&gt;[http://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/281291_10150330329841133_522561132_10053593_8036417_n.jpg Kerrang!

==Career==
=== Early years (2002 - 2004) ===
Sonic Boom Six first appeared on the Manchester [[punk rock|punk]] scene in April 2002. Some of their members were previously in the band Grimace. Their self-titled demo, recorded with Jerry Melchers, was self-released in October 2002. To promote the CD, they toured the UK with [[second wave ska]] veterans [[The Toasters]] and London [[ska punk]]/hip hop band [[King Prawn]]. They also toured with [[Coolie Ranx]] and performed as his backing band. In September 2003, they released [[The Turbo EP]], their first release for [[Moon Ska Europe]]. This was produced by [[Ace (musician)|Ace]] (of [[Skunk Anansie]]) and Christophe. After a series of good reviews, Sonic Boom Six were invited to perform a session on [[BBC Radio One]]'s ''The Lock Up''.

After further touring with [[Catch 22 (band)|Catch 22]], as well as on the Moon Ska ''Launchpad Tour 2004'' (alongside Zen Baseballbat, Graveltrap, [[Babar Luck]] and Dumpster Pop), the band re-united with Ace and Christophe to record their second EP. ''[[Sounds to Consume]]'' was released on [[Moon Ska Europe]] in August 2004, and include the ''Turbo'' EP as bonus tracks. After tour dates with [[Leftöver Crack]] and [[The Suicide Machines]], the band appeared on [[BBC2]]'s Asian arts programme [[Desi DNA]] performing in a scrapyard, as well as being interviewed by [[Adil Ray]] for his show on the [[BBC Asian Network]].

=== Deck Cheese to Rebel Alliance (2005 - 2009) ===
[[File:SB6-Leeds06.JPG|left|thumb|300px|Sonic Boom Six performing "All In" with Itch of [[The King Blues]]. [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Leeds Festival]], [[Bramham Park]], 27 August 2006]]
In early February 2005, Sonic Boom Six replaced guitarist Dave "Hellfire" Kelly with guitarist Ben Childs, who used to play sax, thus making SB6 a four-piece. Ben's old saxophone parts were played through a sampler when performing live, or by musicians from other bands, such as [[Grown at Home]] and The Flaming Tsunamis. In 2005, the band opened the [[Love Music Hate Racism]] event on the Leftfield Stage at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], played Belgium's Sortie 23 festival and performed at the premier of the [[Rock Against Racism]] film ''Who Shot the Sheriff?'' with [[HARD-Fi]] and [[Roll Deep]]. 2005 also saw the release of the ''Champion Edition'' of Sounds to Consume, which featured four of their original demo tracks (remixed by Tim G), three remixes, an acoustic track and a video. They also embarked on several dates on the inaugural [[Good To Go Tour]] alongside [[The Aquabats]] and Never Heard of It.

In 2006, the band recorded their second session for BBC Radio 1's ''The Lock Up'', which was broadcast on 27 June. They were joined by Pete and Tucker from Jesse James and Itch from [[The King Blues]]. Their debut full-length album, ''[[The Ruff Guide to Genre-Terrorism]]'', was released on 10 July 2006 on London label Deck Cheese Records, also home at the time to [[Phinius Gage]], Sick On The Bus and Jesse James.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/label/115520-Deck-Cheese-Records|title=Deck Cheese Records|website=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006 the band played the [[Reading Festival|Reading and Leeds Festivals]] as a last minute replacement for [[Paramore]]. They were joined again by Itch of [[The King Blues]] for a performance of "All In" (singing the parts of the song written by [[Coolie Ranx]]) and Nick 'The Blade' Horne of [[Howards Alias]], partner of vocalist Laila, who played trombone on the songs "Bigger Than Punk Rock" and "Until the Sunlight Comes".

In February 2007 the band embarked on the inaugural ''Ruff and Ready Tour'', a multi-band package tour put together by Sonic Boom Six. This initial tour featured the band with support from [[The King Blues]], [[Failsafe (UK band)|Failsafe]] and [[Mouthwash (band)|Mouthwash]].

In May 2007 they played at the Slam Dunk Festival at Leeds University Union with Paramore and [[Reel Big Fish]]. During Reel Big Fish's set, Laila joined the band on stage to sing parts of "She Has a Girlfriend Now" alongside Aaron Barrett.  She joined them again during Reel Big Fish's [[Monkeys for Nothin' and the Chimps for Free|Monkeys for Nothin']] winter tour in 2008. They played the Reading and Leeds Festivals again in 2007, on the Lock Up stage, playing not only their own material but covering the song "Sound System" by [[Operation Ivy (band)|Operation Ivy]]. During this song, Itch from the King Blues once again joined them on stage to sing it.

In May 2008 the band embarked on the ''Rude Awakening 2008'' tour, alongside [[Big D and the Kids Table]] and [[Random Hand]]. 2008 also saw a second Ruff and Ready tour. This was followed by the release of a remixes, b-sides and rarities album entitled ''Play On: Rare, Rejected and Arcade Perfected'', which the band toured in support of in late 2008. Nick Horne also joined the band as a full-time member, now playing guitar and bass live as well as trombone. They played at the [[Hevy Music Festival]] on 1 August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.funkypixel.co.uk/blog/events/hevy-music-festival-2009/ Hevy Music Festival 2009 « Funky Pixel Photography | Modern Wedding Photography in Rochester, Medway, Maidstone and Kent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610043608/http://www.funkypixel.co.uk/blog/events/hevy-music-festival-2009/ |date=10 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child's departure and ''Sonic Boom Six'' (2009 - 2015) ===
On 8 October 2009, it was announced on the band's official website that Ben Childs would be leaving the band after the forthcoming "Boom or Bust" tour and that he would be temporarily replaced by Matthew Reynolds – current vocalist and guitarist with rock band Drawings and also formerly of [[Howards Alias]]. In February 2010 new permanent member James "Jimmy T Boom" Routh, formerly of Myth of Unity, joined the band on guitar. Lee Hartney from [[The Smith Street Band]] joined the band on two tours in 2011, playing guitar &amp; keytar.

On 4 February 2012, in a radio interview with Matt Stocks on [[Kerrang Radio]], Paul Barnes and Laila Khan announced that their new album would be [[eponymous]].

During a free gig sponsored by HP Live and Last FM at The Roadhouse in Manchester on 19 April 2012 Barney Boom/Paul Barnes announced that the band were due to sign a deal the following Saturday and that the new album would be released in September 2012.

Sonic Boom Six played the main stage at 2000Trees Festival in Gloucestershire on 13 July 2012.

=== McMinn's departure and ''The F-Bomb'' (2015 to present) ===
It was announced on 14 May 2015 via their Facebook page that founding member Neil "Macca" McMinn had decided to leave the band as he wanted a new challenge after 12 years with the band. The release of Sonic Boom Six's album ''Operation Boom Box'' was delayed to allow the band time to recruit a replacement drummer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/sonicboomsix/photos/a.146453222808.109146.19443552808/10152969623892809|title=Sonic Boom Six|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was confirmed on 22 May 2015 that Luke Hesketh would be taking over drumming duties from Neil McMinn. Luke, along with bandmate James Routh, would be splitting his time between Sonic Boom Six and The Karma Party.{{r|sbdrum}}

After receiving funding via the [[PledgeMusic]] [[crowdfunding]] website the release date of the fifth album ''The F-Bomb'' is 27 May 2016, on [[Cherry Red Records]].&lt;ref name=Pledge /&gt;&lt;ref name=cherry&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cherryred.co.uk/product/the-f-bomb/ |title=The F-Bomb - Cherry Red Records |publisher=Cherryred.co.uk |date=2018-09-13 |accessdate=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, the band released an eight track 'mini-album' ''Cardiac Address''. The record was funded via crowdfunding, as with the preceding release. It featured a less produced and more aggressive sound. Funds raised supported the bands [[Vans Warped Tour|Vans Warped]] American tour, June through August.&lt;ref name="deadpress.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadpress.co.uk/73065/album-sonic-boom-six-cardiac-address |title=ALBUM: Sonic Boom Six – Cardiac Address &amp;#124; DEAD PRESS! &amp;#124; It's more than "just music" to us |publisher=Dead Press! |date= |accessdate=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fuelthescene.com/2017/07/09/interview-with-laila-kahn-of-sonic-boom-six-at-vans-warped-tour-17/` ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sponsorship==
Sonic Boom Six have had sponsorship from [[Jägermeister]].&lt;ref name=spon1 /&gt;  This has taken the form of running a competition to see the band and featuring the band on their website.  The video for Virus was sponsored by the drinks company along with [[Orange Music Electronic Company|Orange Amps]] and [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson Guitars]].&lt;ref name=spon2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=spon3 /&gt;

==Other projects==

===Babyboom===
Sonic Boom Six previously performed acoustically under the name '''Babyboom''', and recorded a [[Babyboom (EP)|self-titled EP]] in February 2006. Whilst the band (with their current line-up) do occasionally play acoustically, it is usually billed as "Sonic Boom Six Acoustic", as opposed to "Babyboom".

===Suicide Bid===
Laila, Barney and Ben also contribute vocals to the ongoing dub/punk project Suicide Bid and feature heavily on the collective's 2006 album ''The Rot Stops Here'' as well as performing live on rare occasions such as Rebellion Festival.

===Rebel Alliance Recordings===
Rebel Alliance Recordings was originally the band's outlet for releasing the second SB6 album, ''Arcade Perfect'', in 2006, but has since grown into a small record label, counting The Babylon Whackers, [[Random Hand]], [[Mouthwash (band)|Mouthwash]] and [[The Skints]] among its ranks.

'''''The Spirit of Life''''' is a sculpture by American sculptor [[Daniel Chester French]].

==Overview==
''The Spirit of Life'' began as a commission for a memorial to the famous Wall Street financier [[Spencer Trask]] (1844–1909). Trask was a summer resident in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]] and a founder of the committee which was charged with renewing the city's reputation as a health resort.  The commission for the monument came from [[George Foster Peabody]] who was a friend of Trask's. [[Henry Bacon]], who collaborated with French on the [[Lincoln Memorial]], designed the setting for French's statue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yeodoug.com/resources/dc_french/spirit_of_life/dcfrench_spirit_of_life.html Daniel Chester French: ''The Spirit of Life''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Audrey Munson]] was the model for the statue.

The statue stands in the heart of [[Canfield Casino and Congress Park|Congress Park]] in Saratoga Springs, New York, on a shallow niche of white marble with a balustraded terrace above and an oblong lagoon, set in marble and surrounded with verdant shrubbery, green lawns, and a wealth of flowers below.  The statue is a figure of a winged woman, hands poised high above her head.  The figure represents [[Hygieia]], the giver of health, who usually appeared in Greek and Roman art accompanying her father, [[Asklepios]], the god of medicine. She is often shown offering nourishment to a serpent entwined on the staff Asklepios carries. In French's conception, Hygieia holds a shallow bowl aloft and in the other hand clasps a pine bough, a reference to the towering pines on the grounds of the Trasks' estate. The goddess is poised lightly on a rock, and a stream of water pours from its cleft.  The pedestal is a sculptured reproduction of the tufaceous deposits seen about the orifice of many of Saratoga's famous springs.&lt;ref&gt;Saratoga's Tribut to Spencer Trask; Unveiling of "The Spirit of Life," Completing the Memorial to Him, ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 27, 1915&lt;/ref&gt;  Inscription on the statue reads "To do good and serve my fellow man."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saratogafoodgroup.com/spirit.htm ''The Spirit of Life''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Spirit of Life'' is one of French's finest "active" statues. The flow of the angel's robe and the position of her right foot gives a great deal of motion. Several smaller castings of the statue were made and authorized by French; six were made between 1923 and 1931.

It is considered a [[contributing property|contributing object]] to the [[National Historic Landmark District]] that includes the park and Canfield Casino.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3648">A '''vanity gallery''' is an [[Contemporary art gallery|art gallery]] that charges artists fees to exhibit their work and makes most of its money from artists rather than from sales to the public.  Some vanity galleries charge a lump sum to arrange an exhibition, while others ask artists to pay regular membership fees and then promise to organise an exhibition with a certain period.&lt;ref name="Gulrich"&gt;{{cite book|

==Derivation==
Vanity galleries are an offshoot of [[Artist-run initiative|cooperative galleries]] (also called artist-run initiatives), galleries which are operated by artists who pool their resources to pay for exhibits and publicity.  Unlike cooperative galleries, which carefully jury their members, vanity galleries will exhibit anyone who pays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Occasionally a vanity gallery will appear to have a selection process.  This is because "if every participant is promised a one- or two-person show every two years, the number of artists on the membership roster cannot exceed the available time slots for shows."&lt;ref&gt;Debora Melz (1995), "Vanities: Caveat Exhibitor" in ''Getting Exposure: The Artist's Guide to Exhibiting the Work''.  Art Calendar Publishing, Inc., p. 182. {{ISBN|0-945388-04-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial art galleries derive their profit from sales of artwork and therefore take great care to select art and artists that they believe will sell and will enhance their gallery's reputation.  They spend time and money cultivating collectors.  If the artwork sells, the gallery makes a profit, and the artist is then paid.

Vanity galleries have no incentive to sell art, as they have already been paid by the artist.  Vanity galleries are not selective because they do not have to be.  Many professional artists recommend that new artists avoid exhibiting work in them, primarily because professional critics and reviewers tend to avoid them.&lt;ref name="Gulrich"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://blogcritics.org/archives/2004/08/10/191830.php Vanity Galleries]'' by Lenny Campello, 10 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Women's Caucus for Art''' (WCA), founded in 1972, is a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[New York City]], which supports women artists, art historians, students, educators, and museum professionals. The WCA holds exhibitions and conferences to promote women artists and their works and recognizes the talents of artists through their annual [[Women's Caucus for Art Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]]. Since 1975 it has been a [[United Nations]]-affiliated non-governmental organization (NGO), which has broadened its influence beyond the United States. Within the WCA are several special interest causes including the Women of Color caucus{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}, Eco-Art Caucus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalwca.org/membership/ecoarts.php|title=WCA Mission|website=www.nationalwca.org|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Jewish Women Artist Network&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalwca.org/membership/jwan.php|title=WCA Mission|website=www.nationalwca.org|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, International Caucus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalwca.org/membership/international.php|title=WCA International Caucus|website=www.nationalwca.org|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Young Women's Caucus&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalwca.org/membership/ywcaucus.php|title=Young Women's Caucus|website=www.nationalwca.org|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The founding of the WCA is seen as a "great stride" in the feminist art movement.

==Overview==
The Women's Caucus for Art membership includes artists, students, educators, art historians, and professionals from museums and galleries. The organization holds conferences, produces exhibitions, conducts research and [[Women's Caucus for Art Lifetime Achievement Award|issues awards]].&lt;ref name="Ferguson"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7CcOxVMl-9EC&amp;pg=PA203 Ferguson Career Resource Guide for Women and Minorities: Resources for women]''.

Along with the founding of the [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]], its creation is seen as one of the "great strides [that] have been made in developing an institutional infrastructure for women's art and art history since the 1970s."&lt;ref name="Ressler2003"&gt;Susan R.

==History==

===Background===
{{main|Feminist art movement in the United States}}
Within the broader [[feminist movement]] of the late 1960s and early 1970s, a [[feminist art movement in the United States|feminist art movement]] began to contest women's under-representation in professional art organizations, [[art exhibitions]] and [[art history]] textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Grace Glueck]]|first=|title=Art People|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1978/01/27/110780534.pdf|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 27, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement "was a major watershed in women's history and the history of art." Its slogan was "the personal is political."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Power of Feminist Art: The American Movement of the 1970s, History and Impact|year=1996|publisher=Harry N.

In 1969, Women Artists in Revolution (WAR) formed in response to the inclusion of “only 8 women among the 143 artists shown” at the Whitney Museum’s 1969 Annual. WAR “demanded that the museum change its policies to include more women artists.” In 1971, [[Linda Nochlin]]’s "Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?|url=http://www.artnews.com/2007/11/01/top-ten-artnews-stories-exposing-the-hidden-he/|journal=ArtNews|date=January 1971|volume=69|pages=22–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Judy Chicago]] and [[Miriam Schapiro]] started the Feminist Art Program at Cal Arts, which provided a new arts education for women based on mentorship, training in tools, research about women artists, consciousness-raising, and role-playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Power of Feminist Art: The American Movement of the 1970s, History and Impact|year=1996|publisher=Harry N.

===College Art Association Women's Caucus===
At its annual conference in San Francisco, women within the [[College Art Association]] formed a women's caucus on 28 January 1972, electing [[Ann Sutherland Harris]] as the first president (1972-1974).&lt;ref name="Dickinson"&gt;Eleanor Dickinson, [http://www.nationalwca.org/wcadocs/TheHistory%20of%20the%20WCA.pdf The History of the Women's Caucus for Art]. Retrieved 7 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, tensions developed between this group and the CAA board, and in November 1973 the CAA executive asked "the Women's Caucus, which is not officially affiliated with the CAA, to drop the use of the phrase 'of the CAA' from its name."&lt;ref name="Ball2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Judith K.

===Women's Caucus for Art founded===
In 1974 [[Mary Garrard]], president of the caucus from 1974 to 1976, oversaw the formation of the Women's Caucus for Art (WCA) as an independent non-profit organization. [[Arlene Raven]], who, with [[Judy Chicago]] and [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]], founded the Feminist Studio Workshop of Women's Building, was also part of WCA's roots&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cotter|first=Holland|title=Arlene Raven, 62, a Historian and Supporter of Women's Art, is Dead|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/arts/06raven.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; as was Eleanor Dickenson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Love|first=Barbara|title=Feminists Who Changed America, 1963-1975|year=2006|publisher=University of Illinois Press|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The WCA grew, establishing regional chapters and publishing research on women's art. Membership broadened from predominantly art historians to a majority of women artists,&lt;ref name="Ball2010"/&gt; and the third president, Judy Brodsky, was herself an artist rather than art historian.&lt;ref name="Dickinson"/&gt;

In 1977 the [[Coalition of Women's Art Organizations]] (CWAO) was formed as a political arm of the WCA.&lt;ref name="Dickinson"/&gt;

==Organizational structure==
The Women's Caucus for Art is a national member organization with 23 regional chapters located throughout the United States. The headquarters, in New York City, is an umbrella organization governed by a national board of directors consisting of an executive committee (president, president elect, treasurer/secretary, vice president/chair of national exhibitions, past president/chair of legacy, vice president of chapter relations, vice president for organizational outreach, vice president for development and vice president of special events), regional vice presidents, standing committee chairs, directors (including chairs of internal caucuses)) and board-appointed advisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About WCA - WCA Current Board|url=http://www.nationalwca.org/aboutwca/board.php|publisher=Women's Caucus for Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National President is voted in by the membership for two-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WCA Past Presidents|url=http://www.nationalwca.org/aboutwca/pastpresidents.php|publisher=Women's Caucus for Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; Half of the board is nominated by the incoming president and approved by the board, and the other half is voted in by chapter representatives.

Many of the regional chapters are organized as separate 501(c)3 non profit organizations. The Northeast Region consists of WCA New Hampshire, Central Mass WCA, WCA New York, and Philadelphia WCA. The Southeast Region consists of Greater Washington DC WCA, WCA Georgia, WCA Alabama, WCA Florida, and WCA Louisiana. The Midwest Region consists of Chicago WCA, WCA Michigan, WCA Minnesota, WCA Indiana, WCA Nebraska, and St. Louis Missouri WCA. The Southwest Region consists of WCA Colorado and Texas WCA. The Pacific Region consists of WCA Northern California, WCA Peninsula, WCA Monterey Bay, Silicon Valley WCA, Southern California WCA and Oregon WCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = WCA Chapters|url = http://nationalwca.org/membership/chapters.php|website = nationalwca.org|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special-interest caucuses==
Within the WCA are several special interest causes including the Women of Color caucus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ringgold|first1=Faith|title=We Flew Over The Bridge|date=1995|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston|isbn=0821220713|page=263|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eco-Art Caucus, Jewish Women Artist Network, International Caucus and the Young Women's Caucus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalwca.org/membership/internalcaucuses.php|title=WCA Internal Caucuses|website=www.nationalwca.org|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being appointed to Vice President of Minority Affairs by the President Ofelia Garcia in 1986, artist and activist [[Faith Ringgold]] proposed the formation of a women of color caucus. It was within this context that "Coast to Coast", an arts organization for women of color, was created.&lt;ref&gt;Ringgold 1995, pg. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish Women Artist Network (JWAN) was founded by Francia Tobacman. From 2006-2012 it organized national conferences of Jewish related themes. The International Caucus maintains WCA's involvement with the United Nations, develops art exhibitions related to the UN Goals, develops collaborative projects with other global organizations, collects data about WCA's art and activism projects, and shares this information with the larger WCA membership. The Young Women's Caucus supports women artists of who are college students, returning students and young professionals seeking to create a career in art.&lt;ref name="Ferguson" /&gt; It provides networking resources to established women artists within the broader organization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Lifetime Achievement Awards==
{{main|Women's Caucus for Art Lifetime Achievement Award}}
In 1979 the WCA created the National Lifetime Achievement Awards. The goal was to acknowledge the work of notable women in the arts and stimulate the growth of opportunities within the arts. An important annual function, honorees are selected by a group of notable WCA scholars and artists. A few honorees include painter [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], painter [[Alice Neel]], art historian [[Lucy R. Lippard]], sculptor and painter [[Selma Burke]], and women's museum founder [[Wilhelmina Holladay]].&lt;ref name="Marter2011"&gt;[[Joan Marter|Joan M. Marter]].

==United Nations affiliation==
The Women's Caucus for Art has been a [[United Nations]]-affiliated NGO (non-governmental agency) since 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's Caucus for Art Profile|url=http://esango.un.org/civilsociety/showProfileDetail.do?method=showProfileDetails&amp;tab=3&amp;profileCode=609794|publisher=NGO Branch, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[NGO]] is "any non-profit, voluntary citizens' group which is organized on a local, national or international level. Task-oriented and driven by people with a common interest, NGOs perform a variety of service and humanitarian functions, bring citizen concerns to Governments, advocate and monitor policies and encourage political participation through provision of information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngo.org/ngoinfo/define.html|publisher=NGO Global Network |title=DEFINITION OF NGOs |deadurl=no |accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the liaison group between WCA and the United Nations, WCA's International Caucus members have participated in, and created exhibitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Public Information Non-governmental Organizations Conference |url=https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/ngoconference/shared/Documents/Final%20Exhibits.pdf|publisher=UN Department of Public Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; side events at UN DPI/NGO conferences in support of UN goals and priorities and participated in UN Commission on the Status of Women conferences.

In the fall of 1995, the UN-sponsored Fourth World International Conference on Women was held in China. "The purpose of the conference was to discuss the advancement and involvement of women in world affairs." The WCA sent 100 women artists, art educators and art activists to attend conferences and workshops. "As a reaction to this expedition, the artists were asked to create works depicting their experiences. From this was born the exhibit Beijing and Beyond: Women Artists Respond To The World Conference On Women."&lt;ref name="Lemmon"/&gt;

==Plot==
Ayellet ([[Alma Zack]]) makes good money as the village tailor, and when her father, Meir ([[Yehuda Barkan]]), turns to agricultural politics, her husband, Yaniv, turns the family farm into a profitable business exporting yellow peppers. Both men help her raise Natty, her teenage daughter from a former marriage, and Omri, her toddler son from the present one. The few indications she has of Omri's developmental problem do not bother her because the village physician says everything was okay.

When Ayellet's brother, Avshy, returns to the village, it seems like a new opportunity: Avshy would replace Yaniv in the greenhouses and Yaniv would build their new biker restaurant. However, Avshy's wife, Yaely, a physician, wants to give her marriage a second chance and comes with her husband to live on the farm. Yaely is concerned about Omri's symptoms. Meir drives the child to the closest town where he is diagnosed as autistic.

Ayellet removes Omri from kindergarten, and the family organizes an intensive therapeutic [[homeschooling]] plan. Ayellet stops spending time with her daughter and stops working. No money is left for completing the restaurant. Ayellet fires her brother from managing the greenhouses, and he becomes depressed and leaves his wife. Yaniv stops participating the homeschooling.

Yaniv wants Ayellet to get pregnant again but she refuses.

Yaniv fights with Ayellet about taking Omri to the parties they have in the village. Yaniv wants to take him to a celebration at the kindergarten but Omri disappears. Yaniv forces Ayellet to tell the police and the village, who are searching for Omri, that he is autistic. The family explains to everyone that calling Omri by his name will not make him answer. When night falls, Omri is found in the kindergarten.
