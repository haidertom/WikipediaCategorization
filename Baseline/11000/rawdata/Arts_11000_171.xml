The year '''1963 in film''' involved some significant events, including the big-budget epic ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'', [[Alfred Hitchcock's]] horror [[The Birds (film)|''The Birds'']], and two films with all-star casts, ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' and ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]''.

==Events==
* February 20 – The classic epic western ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' premieres.
* June 12 – ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'', starring [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rex Harrison]] and [[Richard Burton]], premieres at the Rivoli Theatre in New York City. Its staggering production costs nearly bankrupted [[Twentieth Century Fox]] and the adulterous affair between Taylor and Burton made the publicity even worse. ''Cleopatra'' marked the only instance that a film would be the highest-grossing film of a year while still losing money, thus establishing it as, at the time, [[List of box office bombs|the biggest box office disaster in cinema history]]. The film's terrible reception harmed the reputation of director [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]], who had an esteemed career for directing classics like ''[[A Letter to Three Wives]]'', ''[[All About Eve]]'', ''[[Julius Caesar (1953 film)|Julius Caesar]]'', ''[[The Barefoot Contessa]]'', ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'', and ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer]]''. It effectively destroyed the career of its well-known producer [[Walter Wanger]], who never worked in Hollywood or on another film again; he died five years later at the age of 74 of a heart attack. Much of the blame of the film's failures could be pointed at Taylor's super-diva personality, her health issues, her and Burton's adulterous affair, and the studio's inadequate management. It wouldn't be until two years later that [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s adaptation of ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' would help rescue Fox from bankruptcy by becoming [[List of highest-grossing films in Canada and the United States#Adjusted for ticket-price inflation|one of the highest-grossing motion pictures of all time]].
* November 7 – The classic comedy ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' premieres and it boasts one of the finest [[all-star]] ensemble casts ever, easily the most impressive for a comedy. It is also the first comedy film ever directed by [[Stanley Kramer]], best known for directing serious human drama films on controversial subjects like ''[[The Defiant Ones (film)|The Defiant Ones]]'', ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'', ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'', and ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]''.
* December 25 – [[Walt Disney]]'s production of ''[[The Sword in the Stone (film)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' premieres. It is the second adaptation of [[T. H. White]]'s ''[[The Once and Future King]]'' after the [[Alan Jay Lerner]] and [[Frederick Loewe]] musical ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'', the first cinematic adaptation of the novel, and the 13th film adaptation of the legend of [[King Arthur]].

'''''Beyond: Two Souls''''' is an [[Interactive movie|interactive drama]] and [[action-adventure game]] for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation 4]] home video game consoles, developed by [[Quantic Dream]] and published by [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony Computer Entertainment]]. It was released in October 2013. The [[single-player video game|game]] features Jodie Holmes, one of two [[player character]]s. The other is an [[incorporeality|incorporeal]] entity named Aiden: a separate soul linked to Jodie since birth. Jodie, who is portrayed by actress [[Ellen Page]], possesses supernatural powers through her psychic link to Aiden, growing from adolescence to adulthood while learning to control Aiden and the powers they share. [[Willem Dafoe]] co-stars as Nathan Dawkins, a researcher in the Department of Paranormal Activity and Jodie's surrogate-father-figure. The actors in the game worked during the year-long project in Quantic Dream's Paris studio to perform on-set [[voice acting]] and [[motion-capture acting]].

Despite being a video game, ''Beyond: Two Souls'' premiered at the 2013 [[Tribeca Film Festival]], marking only the second time the film festival recognised a video game. [[David Cage]], writer and director of the game, explained that game development studios should provide "[[interactive storytelling]]" that can be played by everyone, including non-gamers. The game received polarised critical reception upon its release. Sales reached over one million copies two months after its worldwide release by the end of 2013. Two years later, a PlayStation 4 version was released, both as a standalone title and then in the ''Quantic Dream Collection'' with the 2010 title ''[[Heavy Rain]]''.

== Gameplay ==
''Beyond: Two Souls'' is an [[Interactive movie|interactive drama]] and [[action-adventure game]], requiring the player to move and guide the character into interactions with objects and other [[non-player character]]s in the scene to progress the story. The player primarily controls Jodie through the in-game environments. At almost any time, however, the player (or second player during a [[two-player video game|two-player game]]) can switch to control Aiden instead. Aiden, as an [[incorporeality|incorporeal]] entity, exists permanently in [[noclip mode]] and can move through walls, ceilings, and other obstacles; however, he is limited to moving only within a certain radius around Jodie due to their spiritual tethering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Beyond: Two Souls' a solid tale bogged down by gameplay |last=Bowers |first=Brian |date=10 October 2013 |work=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]] |url=http://www.stripes.com/military-life/beyond-two-souls-a-solid-tale-bogged-down-by-gameplay-1.246432 |accessdate=25 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014040434/http://www.stripes.com/military-life/beyond-two-souls-a-solid-tale-bogged-down-by-gameplay-1.246432 |archivedate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While playing as Jodie, the [[game mechanics|game]] includes interactive objects marked with a white dot, which can be interacted with by tilting the [[game controller|controller]] stick in its direction. If Jodie must perform a specific action, [[Icon (computing)|icon]]s pop up on the screen to prompt the player to press and/or hold certain controller buttons. Conversation prompts float in the air, defaulting to a certain choice if too much time passes before selection. During action sequences, like chases or hand-to-hand [[fighting game|combat]], the cinematography moves into [[slow motion]] whilst Jodie performs the physical manoeuvre; during this time, the player must determine the direction Jodie is moving and push the controller stick in that direction to complete the action. Other sequences require real-time [[stealth game|stealth]], which has the player sneak Jodie through environments while coordinating certain actions with Aiden. Failing certain action sequences will alter the course of a chapter (and sometimes later chapters) and in some cases lead to the death of a non-playable character.&lt;ref name="David Cage Gameplay"&gt;{{cite web |title=Beyond: Two Souls – Gameplay from E3 2013 |last=Cage |first=David |date=11 June 2013 |work=[[PlayStation Blog]] |publisher=[[Sony Interactive Entertainment]] |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/06/11/beyond-two-souls-gameplay-from-e3-2013/ |accessdate=25 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085421/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/06/11/beyond-two-souls-gameplay-from-e3-2013/ |archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TrustedReviews Gameplay"&gt;{{cite web |title=Beyond: Two Souls review – Gameplay |last=Andrews |first=Stuart |date=October 2014 |work=Trusted Reviews |url=https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/beyond-two-souls |accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While playing as Aiden, the game becomes [[monochrome|monochromatic]]. Amongst the shades of greys, interactive objects are highlighted by an [[aura (paranormal)|aura]] shining in one of several colours, with the colour of the aura indicating his potential interaction: orange characters can be possessed, red characters strangled, blue objects (or characters with environmental effects) knocked around, and green characters healed. Jodie frequently calls upon Aiden to provide different abilities, such as form a protective shield around her, allow the dead to speak to the living through her, grant her an ability to see events of the recent past, and enable her to heal a character's wounds.&lt;ref name="David Cage Gameplay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TrustedReviews Gameplay"/&gt;

As the player makes choices throughout the game, the gameplay's plot is revealed. Besides affecting dialogue and story developments, the outcome of entire scenes (and in some cases, the outcome of scenes several chapters later) can be manipulated to a certain extent based on player choices. These choices are typically moral decisions made through Jodie's dialogue options, interventions with various characters, success or failure in her combat scenes, or psychic actions that the player chooses to have Aiden perform.&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; Examples of choice-based outcomes are the chapter titled The Party, where the player is given the choice of unleashing brutal revenge toward a group of bullies or simply running away, and the chapter titled The Embassy, where the player can either engage in psychic information retrieval or can jeopardise the mission by forcing one of the guards to commit suicide. Choices also determine the finale of ''Beyond: Two Souls'', as any number of possible plot endings can be experienced by the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Player Choice and Branching Narrative in Beyond: Two Souls |last=Boudreaux |first=Brian |date=29 October 2013 |work=Press X To Story |url=http://www.pressxtostory.com/2015/01/player-choice-and-branching-narrative.html |accessdate=25 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115025929/http://www.pressxtostory.com/2015/01/player-choice-and-branching-narrative.html |archivedate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
:''While the story is told through [[nonlinear narrative]], this summary is given in chronological order.''

Young Jodie Holmes (Caroline Wolfson) lives with her foster parents in a suburban home. Since birth, Jodie has had a psychic connection with a mysterious entity named Aiden, with whom she can communicate and perform telepathic acts, such as possessing people's minds and manipulating certain objects. After an incident with some neighbourhood kids results in Aiden almost killing one of them, Jodie's foster parents seek help to care for her condition, permanently leaving her under the custody of doctors Nathan Dawkins ([[Willem Dafoe]]) and Cole Freeman ([[Kadeem Hardison]]) of the United States Department of Paranormal Activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Beyond: Two Souls |developer=Quantic Dream |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=8 October 2013 |platform=PlayStation 3 |level=My Imaginary Friend, First Interview, First Night, Alone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the two doctors' care, Jodie slowly learns to control Aiden and the powers they share. During this time, Nathan and Cole are building the condenser, a portal that connects the world of the living with the world of the dead—the Infraworld. One night, Nathan learns that his wife and daughter were killed in a car accident. While trying to comfort him, Jodie discovers that she can channel spirits of the dead from the Infraworld; she helps the spirits speak to the living through a psychic link created by her physical contact. As the years pass, a teenage Jodie ([[Ellen Page]]) seeks her independence, both from the doctors and from Aiden, and tries several times to live a normal life. At each attempt, Aiden intervenes, ending in disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Beyond: Two Souls |developer=Quantic Dream |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=8 October 2013 |platform=PlayStation 3 |level=The Experiment, Night Session, Hauntings, The Party, Like Other Girls}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point, Nathan asks for Jodie's help with the condenser, which has broken open. After braving hostile entities from the Infraworld, Jodie manages to shut down the condenser and warns Nathan not to build another. This gets the attention of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], who send agent Ryan Clayton ([[Eric Winter]]) to forcibly recruit Jodie. After training, the now-adult Jodie goes on multiple missions as a field agent, often with Ryan, to whom she slowly becomes attracted. On one such mission in Somalia, Jodie learns that the target she killed was not a warlord, but the country's benign president. An enraged Jodie flees in disgust, despite Ryan's pleas. Branded a traitor, Jodie becomes a fugitive, evading pursuing CIA forces. Along the way, she befriends a small group of homeless people, one of whom she helps give birth to a girl named Zoey, and she lives with a family of Native Americans, during which she encounters another love interest named Jay and saves them from a malevolent entity. The CIA eventually recaptures Jodie after she attempts to reconnect with her catatonic biological mother, who has been held and forcibly drugged for decades in a military hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Beyond: Two Souls |developer=Quantic Dream |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=8 October 2013 |platform=PlayStation 3 |level=The Condenser, Separation, Welcome to the CIA, The Embassy, The Dinner, The Mission, Hunted, Homeless, Broken, Navajo, Old Friends, Nora}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA hands Jodie over to Nathan, now executive director of the DPA, overseeing the DPA's newest condenser, code-named the Black Sun. He reveals that the CIA is willing to let Jodie go if she agrees to a final mission. Jodie and a CIA team led by Ryan destroy an underwater facility housing a Chinese-developed condenser before it is used to attack the United States. Jodie then learns that Nathan built a miniature condenser to speak exclusively to his family, but without success. After showing Nathan that his refusal to let them go is only making them suffer, Jodie tries to leave, only to be held in captivity by the CIA—the organisation has deemed her too dangerous to be freed. Jodie is subjected to the same fate as her mother. Nathan appears and informs Jodie that he's decided to shut down the containment field to the Black Sun, merging the two worlds together and making death meaningless. Too weak to free Jodie, Aiden contacts Ryan and Cole, leading them to her. After Nathan shuts down the containment field, the three chase after him into the heart of the Black Sun, with the intent of destroying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Beyond: Two Souls |developer=Quantic Dream |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=8 October 2013 |platform=PlayStation 3 |level=Briefing, Dragon's Hideout, Black Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trek towards the Black Sun, Cole is injured by entities and Ryan sacrifices his own safety to keep Jodie alive. Eventually, Jodie confronts Nathan near the Black Sun. He commits suicide to reunite with his family. As Jodie shuts down the condenser, she has a vision—Aiden is her stillborn twin brother. Jodie must make a choice: go back to the world of the living, or go on to the Infraworld and be reunited with everyone she has lost. If Jodie chooses Life, her connection to Aiden is severed and she is no longer useful to the CIA. Jodie must choose how to live her life, either alone or with Ryan, Jay, or Zoey and her family. If Jodie chooses Beyond, she joins Aiden and other lost ones in the Infraworld, dying in the process. She continues to watch over those who remain in the living world, warning the now-teenage Zoey of the coming danger. By the story's end, the Infraworld has become a widespread threat in the not-so-distant future. Jodie prepares to confront the threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Beyond: Two Souls |developer=Quantic Dream |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=8 October 2013 |platform=PlayStation 3 |level=Black Sun, Epilogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Cage]], founder and CEO of [[Quantic Dream]], announced ''Beyond: Two Souls'' at [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony]]'s press conference during the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012]].

On 5 September 2013, the [[PlayStation Blog]] announced that a [[game demo|demo]] for ''Beyond: Two Souls'' would be released 1 October 2013 in the United States, 2 October for Europe, and 3 October for Japan, about a week prior to the full game's worldwide release. Despite the demo's official release date, a few users of the paid subscription service [[PlayStation Plus]] were allowed to receive the demo a week earlier, on 24 September 2013. [[GameStop]] also gave out a limited number of [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta]] keys on that day.&lt;ref name="blog.us.playstation.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Makuch |first=Eddie |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-now-offering-beyond-two-souls-beta-keys/1100-6414918/ |title=GameStop now offering Beyond: Two Souls beta keys |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=24 September 2013 |accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full game was released on 8 October 2013 in North America, 9 October 2013 in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and 11 October 2013 in the UK.&lt;ref name=blog&gt;{{cite web |title=Willem Dafoe, Ellen Page Star in Beyond: Two Souls October 8 |work=[[PlayStation Blog]] |publisher=[[Sony Interactive Entertainment]] |last=Osgood |first=Derek |date=1 March 2013 |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/03/01/willem-dafoe-ellen-page-star-in-beyond-two-souls-october-8th/ |accessdate=25 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523070057/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/03/01/willem-dafoe-ellen-page-star-in-beyond-two-souls-october-8th/ |archivedate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AUSreleasedate&gt;{{cite web |url=https://progressbar.com.au/news/beyond-two-souls-release-date-announced/ |title=Beyond: Two Souls Release Date Announced |publisher=Progress Bar |last=Roberts |first=Brendan |date=4 June 2013 |accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VG247releasedate&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vg247.com/2013/10/08/beyond-two-souls-reviews-for-quantic-dreams-latest-arrive-get-all-the-scores-here/ |title=Beyond: Two Souls - reviews for Quantic Dream's latest arrive, get all the scores here |publisher=[[VG247]] |last=Nunneley |first=Stephany |date=8 October 2013 |accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IGNreleasedate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/25/gamestop-is-shouting-fans-a-beyond-two-souls-demo-code |title=GameStop is Shouting Fans a Beyond: Two Souls Demo Code |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |last=O'Brien |first=Lucy |date=24 September 2013 |accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European version of the game is censored to keep the [[PEGI]] rating at 16 instead of 18. Two changes were made amounting to 5–10 seconds of gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-10-01-sony-confirms-beyond-censored-in-europe |title=Sony confirms Beyond censored in Europe |last=Yin-Poole |first=Wesley |date=1 October 2013 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the game was released, nude images of Jodie, actress Ellen Page, surfaced on the [[Reddit]] online community. The game did include one nude scene of Jodie—showering, shown at an angle that preserves the character's modesty—however the leaked images were full-frontal. Industry analysts deduced that a person in possession of a developer PlayStation 3 that allowed [[quality assurance]] features such as "free camera" mode had used the special PlayStation to create and upload the images. Sony immediately took steps to remove them, asking for the community's assistance and explaining that the images were of a digital model and not of Page, who has a "no nudity" policy in titles she appears in. The images were removed from the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/1003507/ellen-page-nude-beyond-two-souls-leaked-shower-scene-photos/ |title=Ellen Page Nude in Beyond: Two Souls, Sony Objects To Leaked Shower Scene Photos |date=23 October 2013 |work=[[Inquisitr]] |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Quantic Dream announced a PlayStation 4 version of ''Beyond: Two Souls'' for North America, Europe, and the PAL region alongside ''Heavy Rain''.

While ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' praised the visuals, the performances, and the "bold, genre-defying design work", it expressed disappointment in Quantic Dream; respecting its years of "audacity" pushing the boundaries of the game medium, yet ultimately failing to listen to feedback and instead delivering yet "another flawed experiment—better in some ways, worse in others".&lt;ref name="EGM"/&gt; ''[[IGN]]'' gaming website criticised the game for offering a gaming experience too passive and unrewarding: "It is unwise to build up our expectations of being able to choose our actions and then take that away from us where it feels most important" and a muddy and unfocused interactive drama "to make gamers conditioned to meaningless violence feel something".&lt;ref name="IGN2"/&gt; ''[[Joystiq]]'' criticised the game's lack of solid character interaction and its unbelievable, unintentionally silly plot.&lt;ref name="Joystiq"/&gt; ''[[Destructoid]]'' criticised the game's thin character presentation and frequent narrative dead ends, as well as its lack of meaningful interactivity.&lt;ref name="Destructoid"/&gt; The editor of ''[[Eurogamer]]'' took issue with the "gruelling, sentimental" game being "all story", comparing it to other games that "give the player complete control", observing the triviality of the player choices may modify the tone of each self-contained chapter, but the overall story is "going wherever it's going".&lt;ref name="EuroG"/&gt; ''[[GamesRadar+]]'' liked the game, but warned "you'll never be truly challenged by the gameplay".&lt;ref name="GRadar"/&gt; Entertainer [[Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw]] of ''[[Zero Punctuation]]'' was heavily critical of the game, focusing on the overuse of quick time events, the underuse of the game's central stealth mechanics, and the inconsistent tone and atmosphere, comparing playing the game to "watching any normal film and pressing the pause button every two seconds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/8298-Beyond-Two-Souls |title=Beyond: Two Souls |last=Croshaw |first=Ben |date=23 October 2013 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legacy ===
In November 2014, David Cage discussed the future of video games and referred to the generally negative reviews ''Beyond'' received from [[Gamer#Hardcore gamer|hardcore gamer]]s. "There will always be games for the hardcore gamers who see games as a skill-based sport, or as a way to compete with their friends", he said. He also referred to [[casual game]]rs who play games "as a mere hobby, like many titles for smartphones". He then stated, "We try to develop a middle way, with games that try to tell a story, to carry meaning, and where violence isn't the core activity. Most of all, we try to create an emotion, to make players live something strong and unique, which remains an ambitious challenge in a video game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Riaz |first=Adnan |url=http://www.gamerheadlines.com/2014/11/david-cage-working-something-exciting/ |title=David Cage: "We're Working on Something Very Exciting" |publisher=Gamer Headlines |date=28 November 2014 |accessdate=28 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628150039/http://www.gamerheadlines.com/2014/11/david-cage-working-something-exciting/ |archivedate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Black America''''' is an upcoming [[alternative history]] [[television drama]] that imagines a nation-state formed by [[African-Americans]] called New Colonia after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] as [[Reparations for slavery debate in the United States|reparations for slavery]]. The show is a collaboration between producer [[Will Packer]] and ''[[The Boondocks (comic strip)|The Boondocks]]'' creator [[Aaron McGruder]] for [[Amazon Video]]. McGruder is writing screenplays for the series, which has been under development for over a year as of August 2017.&lt;ref name="NYT 8-1-17"&gt;{{cite news|author=Victor, Daniel|title=Amazon Series Imagines a New South|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 2, 2017|page=C3|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/arts/television/amazon-black-america-confederate.html|accessdate=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deadline 8-1-17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/08/black-america-amazon-alt-history-drama-will-packer-aaron-mcgruder-envisions-post-reparations-america-1202139504/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |title='Black America': Amazon Alt-History Drama From Will Packer &amp; Aaron McGruder Envisions Post-Reparations America |date=August 1, 2017 |accessdate=August 3, 2017 |author=Andreeva, Nellie |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collezione Farnesina Experimenta''' is a bilingual book ([[Italian language|Italian]] and [[English language|English]]) that assembles and catalogues the eighty works (reproduced in colour) of the [[Farnesina Experimenta Art Collection]], housed in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]].

Along with exhibitions of the collection that are promoted by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], the aim of the volume is to valorize and make known contemporary Italian art, by supporting those generations of artists who made names for themselves from the nineties to the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Collezione Farnesina - Experimenta Ministero degli Affari Esteri Roma|url = http://1995-2015.undo.net/it/mostra/73598|website = 1995-2015.undo.net|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The volume==
In addition to being a catalogue of the works, the volume contains biographical entries of the artists and four critical essays:
*''What is its Function? '' by Maurizio Calvesi,
*''Experiments For The Future'' by Lorenzo Canova,
*''The Perception Of Young Italian Art'' by Marco Meneguzzo,
*''Contemporary Paradigms'' by Marisa Vescovo,
which reveal how Italian contemporary art still shows a capacity to be reborn, to find a new meaning and new energies for facing the complexity of its own historical moment, by combining elements of the country’s prolific artistic history with the most evolved inclinations of contemporaneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.gangemi.com/scheda.asp?id=8849214863 File card] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711072050/http://www.gangemi.com/scheda.asp?id=8849214863 |date=2011-07-11 }} on Gangemi Editore website.

==Catalogue of the collection==
The [[Farnesina Experimenta Art Collection]] amplifies the Italian collection of art of [[Palazzo della Farnesina]] and represents the current state of art in [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.undo.net/cgi-bin/undo/pressrelease/pressrelease.pl?id=1214940418 Collezione Farnesina Experimenta] «Undo press release». 5 July 2008. URL retrieved 22 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
The collection includes works that have been created using the different forms of expression that distinguish [[contemporary art]]: from [[video art]] to [[painting]], from [[photography]] to [[digital art]], from [[sculpture]] to [[drawing]] to [[Installation art|installation]].
The eighty works in the collection are by artists from all over [[Italy]].

The '''Conseil des arts et des lettres du Québec''' ('''CALQ''') is a public agency founded in 1994 by the [[government of Quebec]].

CALQ offers support and funding for art projects in the performing arts, multidisciplinary arts, circus arts, visual arts, media arts, architectural research, arts and crafts, and literature. It also seeks to broaden the influence of Quebec culture in Canada and abroad, and supports the advanced training of writers and professional artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calq.gouv.qc.ca/calq/mission_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207195706/http://www.calq.gouv.qc.ca/calq/mission_en.htm |archivedate=2011-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ordre des arts et des lettres du Québec==
In 2015, CALQ awarded the inaugural Ordre des arts et des lettres du Québec, honouring achievement in Quebec [[arts and letters]], on the occasion of its 20th anniversary. Thirty-five inductees were added to the order in its first year, including 13 board members. Though inspired by France's [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]], the Quebec order differs in that it has only one grade, that of companion.&lt;ref name="Lemay"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lemay|first1=Daniel|title=Ordre des arts et lettres du Québec: Liza Frulla sera honorée|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/arts/nouvelles/201503/20/01-4853949-ordre-des-arts-et-lettres-du-quebec-liza-frulla-sera-honoree.php|accessdate=3 November 2016|work=La Presse|date=20 March 2015|language=fr-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.calq.gouv.qc.ca/actualites-et-publications/dix-huit-personnalites-quebecoises-decorees-de-lordre-des-arts-et-des-lettres-du-quebec-aujourdhui/|title=CALQ {{!}} Dix-huit personnalités québécoises décorées de l'Ordre des arts et des lettres du Québec aujourd'hui|website=www.calq.gouv.qc.ca|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Creativity''' is a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed. The created item may be intangible (such as an [[idea]], a [[scientific theory]], a [[musical composition]], or a [[joke]]) or a physical object (such as an [[invention]], a [[Literature|literary work]], or a [[painting]]).

Scholarly interest in creativity is found in a number of disciplines, primarily [[psychology]], [[business studies]], and [[cognitive science]], but also [[education]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], [[philosophy]] (particularly [[philosophy of science]]), [[theology]], [[sociology]], [[linguistics]],  and [[economics]], covering  the relations between creativity and general [[intelligence]], personality type, mental and neurological processes, mental health, or [[artificial intelligence]]; the potential for fostering creativity through education and training; the fostering of creativity for national economic benefit, and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning.

== Etymology ==
The [[lexeme]] in the English word ''creativity'' comes from the [[Latin]] term ''creō'' "to create, make": its [[Morphological derivation|derivational suffixes]] also come from Latin. The word "create" appeared in English as early as the 14th century, notably in Chaucer, to indicate divine creation&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert"&gt;{{cite book|last=Runco|first=Mark A.|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9|author2=Albert, Robert S.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Creativity Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in [[The Parson's Tale]]&lt;ref&gt;"And eke Job saith, that in hell is no order of rule. And albeit that God hath '''created''' all things in right order, and nothing without order, but all things be ordered and numbered, yet nevertheless they that be damned be not in order, nor hold no order."&lt;/ref&gt;). However, its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=RuncoAlbert /&gt;

== Definition ==
In a summary of scientific research into creativity, Michael Mumford suggested: "Over the course of the last decade, however, we seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel, useful products" (Mumford, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;110),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mumford | first1 = M. D. | year = 2003 | title = Where have we been, where are we going? Taking stock in creativity research | url = | journal = [[Creativity Research Journal]] | volume = 15 | issue = 2–3| pages = 107–120 | doi=10.1080/10400419.2003.9651403}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in [[Robert Sternberg]]'s words, the production of "something original and worthwhile".&lt;ref name="Sternberg Cognitive Psychology 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sternberg|first1=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|date=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-38701-5|page=479|edition=6|chapter=Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities: Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature.&lt;ref name="Meusburger1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meusburger|first=Peter|title=Milieus of Creativity: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Spatiality of Creativity|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-9876-5 |editor=Meusburger, P. |editor2=Funke, J. |editor3=Wunder, E.|chapter=Milieus of Creativity: The Role of Places, Environments and Spatial Contexts}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an illustration, one definition given by [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Dr. E. Paul Torrance]] described it as "a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results."&lt;ref name="Torrance Test Manual Verbal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torrance|first1=Paul|title=The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking-Norms-Technical Manual Research Edition|publisher=Personnel Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|page=6|chapter=Verbal Tests. Forms A and B-Figural Tests, Forms A and B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aspects ==
Theories of creativity (particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others) have focused on a variety of aspects. The dominant factors are usually identified as "the four Ps" — process, product, person, and place (according to [[James Melvin Rhodes|Mel Rhodes]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mel Rhodes: [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20342603?uid=3737864&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103750220081''An Analysis of Creativity.''] in Phi Delta Kappan 1961, Vol. 42,  No. 7, p. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; A focus on ''process'' is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking (such as [[J. P. Guilford|Guilford]]), or those describing the staging of the creative process (such as [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]) are primarily theories of creative process. A focus on creative ''product'' usually appears in attempts to measure creativity (psychometrics, see below) and in creative ideas framed as successful [[memetics|memes]].&lt;ref name="Gabora"&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Liane Gabora|Gabora, Liane]]|year=1997|title= The Origin and Evolution of Culture and Creativity|journal=Journal of Memetics – Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission|volume=1|url=http://cogprints.org/794/1/oecc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2009|publisher=CENGAGE Learning|isbn=978-0-495-50629-4|page=468|editor=Jaime A. Perkins |editor2=Dan Moneypenny |editor3=Wilson Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A focus on the nature of the creative ''person'' considers more general intellectual habits, such as openness, levels of [[Ideation (creative process)|ideation]], autonomy, expertise, exploratory behavior, and so on. A focus on ''place'' considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes, such as degrees of autonomy, access to resources, and the nature of gatekeepers. Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468" /&gt;

== History of the concept ==
{{Main|History of the concept of creativity}}
[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Greek philosophers like Plato rejected the concept of creativity, preferring to see art as a form of discovery. Asked in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", Plato answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244"&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''A History of Six Ideas: an Essay in Aesthetics'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Ancient views ===
Most ancient cultures, including thinkers of [[Ancient Greece]],&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt; [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], and [[Outline of ancient India|Ancient India]],&lt;ref name="Albert99"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator" except for the expression "''poiein''" ("to make"), which only applied to ''poiesis'' (poetry) and to the ''poietes'' (poet, or "maker") who made it. [[Plato]] did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato, The Republic, Book X – [[wikisource:The Republic/Book X]]&lt;/ref&gt; "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", he answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt;

It is commonly argued that the notion of "creativity" originated in [[Western culture]] through [[Christianity]], as a matter of [[Revelation|divine inspiration]].&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; According to the historian [[Daniel J. Boorstin]], "the early Western conception of creativity was the [[Genesis creation narrative|Biblical story of creation]] given in the ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]''."&lt;ref name="Albert2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not creativity in the modern sense, which did not arise until the [[Renaissance]]. In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, creativity was the sole province of God; humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God's work.&lt;ref name="NiuSternberg"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0091265|last=Niu|first=Weihua|author2=Sternberg, Robert J.|title=The Philosophical Roots of Western and Eastern Conceptions of Creativity|journal=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology|year=2006|volume=26|pages=18–38|url=http://www.westga.edu/~stpp/JTPP_Aticles/26-2/THE1210.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/641OBVx0d?url=http://www.westga.edu/~stpp/JTPP_Aticles/26-2/THE1210.pdf|archivedate=18 December 2011|df=}}; cf. [[Michel Weber]], "[https://www.academia.edu/3640181/_Creativity_Efficacy_and_Vision_Ethics_and_Psychology_in_an_Open_Universe_2006_ Creativity, Efficacy and Vision: Ethics and Psychology in an Open Universe]," in Michel Weber and Pierfrancesco Basile (eds.), ''Subjectivity, Process, and Rationality'', Frankfurt/Lancaster, ontos verlag, Process Thought XIV, 2006, pp. 263-281.&lt;/ref&gt; A concept similar to that of Christianity existed in Greek culture, for instance, [[Muse]]s were seen as mediating inspiration from the Gods.&lt;ref name="Dacey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dacey|first=John|title=Encyclopedia of Creativity, Vol. 1|year=1999|isbn=978-0-12-227076-5|editor=Mark A. Runco |editor2=Steven R. Pritzer|chapter=Concepts of Creativity: A history|publisher=[[Elsevier]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative "[[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]" (Greek) or "[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]" (Latin), linked to the sacred or the divine. However, none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity, and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Albert3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen, not as a conduit for the divine, but from the abilities of "[[Great Man theory|great men]]".&lt;ref name="Albert3" /&gt;

=== The Enlightenment and after ===
The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the [[Renaissance]] and even later.&lt;ref name="NiuSternberg" /&gt; The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the [[Renaissance]], when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual, and not God. This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time, aptly named [[humanism]], which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world, valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Humanism - Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library &amp; Renaissance Culture {{!}} Exhibitions - Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/vatican/humanism.html|website = www.loc.gov|date = 1993-01-08|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this philosophy arose the [[Renaissance man]] (or polymath), an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Leonardo da Vinci {{!}} Italian artist, engineer, and scientist|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonardo-da-Vinci|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

However, this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Albert3" /&gt; By the 18th century and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], mention of creativity (notably in [[aesthetics]]), linked with the concept of [[imagination]], became more frequent.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz80"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tatarkiewicz, Władysław |authorlink=Władysław Tatarkiewicz |title=A History of Six Ideas: an Essay in Aesthetics |location=Translated from the Polish by [[Christopher Kasparek]], The Hague |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the writing of [[Thomas Hobbes]], imagination became a key element of human cognition;&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; [[William Duff (writer)|William Duff]] was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of [[genius]], typifying the separation being made between talent (productive, but breaking no new ground) and genius.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt;

As a direct and independent topic of study, creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt; Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of [[Darwinism]]. In particular, they refer to the work of [[Francis Galton]], who through his [[Eugenics|eugenicist]] outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence, with creativity taken as an aspect of genius.&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and scientists such as [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1896) and [[Henri Poincaré]] (1908) began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes.

=== Twentieth century to the present day ===
The insights of Poincaré and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as [[Graham Wallas]]&lt;ref name="Wallas26"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wallas, G. |title=Art of Thought |year=1926 |authorlink=Graham Wallas}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Wertheimer]]. In his work ''Art of Thought'', published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages:
:(i) ''preparation'' (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions),
:(ii) ''incubation'' (where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening),
:(iii) ''intimation'' (the creative person gets a "feeling" that a solution is on its way),
:(iv) ''illumination'' or insight (where the creative idea bursts forth from its [[preconscious]] processing into conscious awareness);
:(v) ''verification'' (where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).
Wallas' model is often treated as four stages, with "intimation" seen as a sub-stage.

Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the [[evolution]]ary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton&lt;ref name="Simonton99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Simonton, D. K. |year=1999 |title=Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, ''Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity''.

In 1927, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh, later published as ''[[Process and Reality]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitehead|first=Alfred North|title=Process and reality : an essay in cosmology ; Gifford Lectures delivered in the University of Edinburgh during the session 1927–28|year=1978|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-02-934580-1|edition=Corrected}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with having coined the term "creativity" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme: "Whitehead actually coined the term – our term, still the preferred currency of exchange among literature, science, and the arts. . . a term that quickly became so popular, so omnipresent, that its invention within living memory, and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people, quickly became occluded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Steven|title=Introduction: Whitehead Now|journal=Configurations|year=2005|volume=1|issue=13|pages=1–33}}. Cf. [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond (eds.). ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'' (Frankfurt / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, Process Thought X1 &amp; X2, 2008) and Ronny Desmet &amp; Michel Weber (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead. The Algebra of Metaphysics. Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute Memorandum]'', Louvain-la-Neuve, Les Éditions Chromatika, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] measurement of creativity, from the standpoint of orthodox [[Psychology|psychological]] literature, is usually considered to have begun with [[J. P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the topic&lt;ref name="Sternberg99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sternberg, R. J. |author2=Lubart, T. I. |chapter=The Concept of Creativity: Prospects and Paradigms |editor=Sternberg, R. J. |title=Handbook of Creativity |year=1999 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |authorlink=Robert Sternberg |isbn=978-0-521-57285-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity. (It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as 1927 with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargreaves | first1 = H. L. | year = 1927 | title = The faculty of imagination: An enquiry concerning the existence of a general faculty, or group factor, of imagination | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = Monograph Supplement 3 | issue = | pages = 1–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not have the same impact.) Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity (as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]]-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.&lt;ref name="Kozbelt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kozbelt|first=Aaron|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9 |author2=Beghetto, Ronald A. |author3=Runco, Mark A.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Theories of Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Four C" model ===
[[James C. Kaufman]] and Beghetto introduced a "four C" model of creativity; ''mini-c'' ("transformative learning" involving "personally meaningful interpretations of experiences, actions, and insights"), ''little-c'' (everyday problem solving and creative expression), ''Pro-C'' (exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent) and ''Big-C'' (creativity considered great in the given field). This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity. It also, the authors argued, made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals.&lt;ref name="KaufBeg2009"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/a0013688|last=Kaufman|first=James C.|author2=Beghetto, Ronald A.|title=Beyond Big and Little: The Four C Model of Creativity|journal=[[Review of General Psychology]]|year=2009|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–12|authorlink=James C.

The contrast of terms "Big C" and "Little c" has been widely used. Kozbelt, Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity.&lt;ref name=Kozbelt /&gt; [[Margaret Boden]] distinguishes between h-creativity (historical) and p-creativity (personal).&lt;ref name="Boden2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boden|first=Margaret|title=The Creative Mind: Myths And Mechanisms|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-297-82069-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity.&lt;ref name="Simonton97"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.104.1.66|last=Simonton|first=D. K.|title=Creative Productivity: A Predictive and Explanatory Model of Career Trajectories and Landmarks|journal=Psychological Review|year=1997|volume=104|issue=1|pages=66–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories of creative processes ==
There has been much empirical study in [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]] of the processes through which creativity occurs. Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity.

=== Incubation ===
Incubation is a temporary break from [[creative problem solving]] that can result in insight.&lt;ref name="EoC Incubation"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=S. M.|title=Encyclopedia of Creativity Volume I|year=2011|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-375039-6|pages=653–657|edition=2nd|editor=M. A. Runco |editor2=S. R. Pritzker|chapter=Incubation}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some empirical research looking at whether, as the concept of "incubation" in [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]' model implies, a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Ward&lt;ref name="Ward2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ward, T. |year=2003 |chapter=Creativity |editor= Nagel, L. |title=Encyclopaedia of Cognition |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving, and notes how some [[empirical evidence]] is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables "forgetting" of misleading clues. Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become [[fixation (psychology)|fixated]] on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem.&lt;ref name="Smith1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Steven M.|title=The Creative Cognition Approach|year=1995|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|editor=Steven M. Smith |editor2=Thomas B. Ward |editor3=Ronald A. Finke|chapter=Fixation, Incubation, and Insight in Memory and Creative Thinking}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks.&lt;ref name=Anderson2000&gt;"{{cite book |author=Anderson, J. R. |year=2000 |title=Cognitive psychology and its implications |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-1686-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This earlier hypothesis is discussed in [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi]]'s five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over. This allows for unique connections to be made without your consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly (1996). ''Creativity : Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention.'' New York: Harper Perennial. {{ISBN|0-06-092820-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergent and divergent thinking ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]&lt;ref name="Guilford67"&gt;{{cite book |author=Guilford, J. P. |year=1967 |title=The Nature of Human Intelligence |authorlink=J. P. Guilford}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production (commonly renamed [[convergent thinking|convergent]] and [[divergent thinking]]). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms ''flexible'' thinking or [[fluid and crystallized intelligence|fluid intelligence]], which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== Creative cognition approach ===
In 1992, Finke et al. proposed the "Geneplore" model, in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas, those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts.&lt;ref name="Ward1995"&gt;Ward, T.B. (1995). What’s old about new ideas. In S. M. Smith, T. B. Ward &amp; R. A. &amp; Finke (Eds.) ''The creative cognition approach'', 157–178, London: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Weisberg&lt;ref name="Weisberg93"&gt;{{cite book |author=Weisberg, R. W. |year=1993 |title=Creativity: Beyond the myth of genius |publisher=Freeman |isbn=978-0-7167-2119-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued, by contrast, that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results.

=== The Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory ===
Helie and Sun&lt;ref name="HelieSun2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Helie S. |author2=Sun R. | year = 2010 | title = Incubation, insight, and creative problem solving: A unified theory and a connectionist model | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 117 | issue = 3| pages = 994–1024 | doi=10.1037/a0019532 | pmid=20658861|citeseerx=10.1.1.405.2245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; recently proposed a unified framework for understanding [[creative problem-solving|creativity in problem solving]], namely the Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity. This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena (in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of [[Incubation (psychology)|incubation]] and [[insight]]).

The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles, namely:
# The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks; 
# The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing;
# The iterative (and possibly bidirectional) processing. 
A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION cognitive architecture]] and used to simulate relevant human data. This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena.

=== Conceptual blending ===
{{Main|Conceptual blending}}
In ''[[The Act of Creation]]'', [[Arthur Koestler]] introduced the concept of ''bisociation'' — that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference.&lt;ref name="Koestler64"&gt;{{cite book |author=Koestler, A. |title=The Act of Creation |year=1964 |authorlink=Arthur Koestler |isbn=978-0-330-73116-4 |publisher=Pan Books |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was later developed into conceptual blending. In the 1990s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with [[metaphor]], [[analogy]], and [[structure mapping]] have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label [[conceptual blending]].

=== Honing theory ===
Honing theory, developed principally by psychologist [[Liane Gabora]], posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way in which the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.

A central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state.&lt;ref&gt;Gabora, L. &amp; Saab, A. (2011). Creative interference and states of potentiality in analogy problem solving. ''Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society''. July 20–23, 2011, Boston MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly ‘mutating’ predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel ‘half-baked’. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.

Honing theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even through in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.

=== Everyday imaginative thought ===
In everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think "if only...".&lt;ref&gt;Roese, N. J. &amp; Olson, J. M. (1995). ''What Might Have Been: The Social Psychology of Counterfactual Thinking''. Mahwah, New Jersey: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[counterfactual thinking]] is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes.&lt;ref&gt;Markman, K. Klein, W. &amp; Suhr, E. (eds) (2009). ''Handbook of mental simulation and the human imagination.'' Hove, Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth M. J. Byrne|Byrne, R. M. J.]] (2005). The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessing individual creative ability ==
=== Creativity quotient ===
There was a ''creativity quotient'' developed similar to the [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ). It makes use of the results of divergent thinking tests (see below) by processing them further. It gives more weight to ideas that are radically different from other ideas in the response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Allan|date=2004|title=The creativity quotient: An objective scoring of ideational fluency|journal=Creativity Research Journal|volume=16|issue=4|pages=415–419|doi=10.1080/10400410409534552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychometric approach ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]'s group,&lt;ref name="Guilford67" /&gt; which pioneered the modern [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967:
* Plot Titles, where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles.
* Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness.
* Figure Concepts, where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings; these were scored for uncommonness.
* Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks.
* Remote Associations, where participants are asked to find a word between two given words (e.g. Hand _____ Call)
* Remote Consequences, where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events (e.g. loss of gravity)

Building on Guilford's work, [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Torrance]]&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; developed the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://people.uncw.edu/caropresoe/GiftedFoundations/SocialEmotional/Creativity-articles/Kim_Can-we-trust-creativity-tests.pdf|title=Can We Trust Creativity Tests?|author=Kim, Kyung Hee|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills, which were scored on:
* '''Fluency''' – The total number of interpretable, meaningful, and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus.
* '''Originality''' – The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects.
* '''Elaboration''' – The amount of detail in the responses.

Such tests, sometimes called ''Divergent Thinking (DT)'' tests have been both supported&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K.

Considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of [[divergent thinking]] tests using semantic approach. When compared to human raters, [[Natural language processing|NLP]] techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, E. A., &amp; Dunbar, K. N. (2009). Creativity evaluation through latent semantic analysis. In Proceedings of the 31st Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 602–607).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, I. J., &amp; Haarmann, H. (2014). Automated scoring of originality using semantic representations. In Proceedings of the 36th Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (poster paper).&lt;/ref&gt; The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of 0.60 and 0.72 respectively to human graders.

Semantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Acar | first1 = S. | last2 = Runco | first2 = M.

Runco&lt;ref&gt;Other members include Kenes Beketayev PhD Computer Science; Liberty Lidz, PhD Linguistics; Perman Gochyyev, PhD Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; combined expertise in creativity research, natural language processing, computational linguistics, and statistical data analysis to devise a scalable system for computerized automated testing (SparcIt Creativity Index Testing system).

=== Social-personality approach ===
Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity. In these studies, personality traits such as independence of judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation, and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals.&lt;ref name="Sternberg99" /&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be "more open to new experiences, less conventional and less conscientious, more self-confident, self-accepting, driven, ambitious, dominant, hostile, and impulsive." Openness, conscientiousness, self-acceptance, hostility, and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed.&lt;ref name=Feist /&gt; Within the framework of the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] model of personality, some consistent traits have emerged.&lt;ref name="Batey, M. 2006 p. 355-429"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Creativity, intelligence and personality: A critical review of the scattered literature | url = | journal = Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs | volume = 132 | issue = 4| pages = 355–429 | doi=10.3200/mono.132.4.355-430}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Openness to experience]] has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. F. | last3 = Safiullina | first3 = X. | year = 2010 | title = Intelligence, General Knowledge and Personality as Predictors of Creativity | url = | journal = Learning and Individual Differences | volume = 20 | issue = 5| pages = 532–535 | doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2010.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the other Big Five traits, research has demonstrated subtle differences between different domains of creativity. Compared to non-artists, artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness, while scientists are more open to experience, [[Conscientiousness|conscientious]], and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists.&lt;ref name=Feist&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feist | first1 = G. J. | year = 1998 | title = A meta-analysis of the impact of personality on scientific and artistic creativity | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychological Review | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 290–309 | doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0204_5| pmid = 15647135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-report questionnaires ===
An alternative are biographical methods. These methods use quantitative characteristics such as the number of publications, patents, or performances of a work. While this method was originally developed for highly creative personalities, today it is also available as [[Self-report study#Questionnaires and interviews|self-report questionnaires]] supplemented with frequent, less outstanding creative behaviors such as writing a short story or creating your own recipes. For example, the [[Creativity Achievement Questionnaire|Creative Achievement Questionnaire]], a self-report test that measures creative achievement across 10 domains, was described in 2005 and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output.&lt;ref&gt;(Carson, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the English original, it was also used in a Chinese,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ying-Yao|first=Wang, Chia-Chi{{!}}Ho, Hsiao-Chi{{!}}Cheng, Chih-Ling{{!}}Cheng|date=2014-00-00|title=Application of the Rasch Model to the Measurement of Creativity: The Creative Achievement Questionnaire.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1088863|journal=Creativity Research Journal|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|issn=1040-0419}}&lt;/ref&gt; French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bendetowicz|first=David|last2=Urbanski|first2=Marika|last3=Aichelburg|first3=Clarisse|last4=Levy|first4=Richard|last5=Volle|first5=Emmanuelle|date=2017-01|title=Brain morphometry predicts individual creative potential and the ability to combine remote ideas|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010945216303161|journal=Cortex|volume=86|pages=216–229|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2016.10.021|pmid=27919546|issn=0010-9452}}&lt;/ref&gt; and German-speaking&lt;ref name="Form 440–450"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|last2=Schlichting|first2=Kerrin|last3=Kaernbach|first3=Christian|date=2017-11|title=Mentoring functions: Interpersonal tensions are associated with mentees' creative achievement.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=440–450|doi=10.1037/aca0000103|issn=1931-390X}}&lt;/ref&gt; version. It is the self-report questionnaire most frequently used in research.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Creativity and intelligence ==
The potential relationship between creativity and [[intelligence]] has been of interest since the late 1900s, when a multitude of influential studies – from Getzels &amp; Jackson,&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962"&gt;Getzels, J. W., &amp; Jackson, P. W. (1962). Creativity and intelligence: Explorations with gifted students. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Barron,&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963"&gt;Barron, F. (1963). Creativity and psychological health. Princeton: D. Van Nostrand Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallach &amp; Kogan,&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965"&gt;Wallach, M. A., &amp; Kogan, N. (1965). Modes of thinking in young children: A study of the creativity-intelligence distinction. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; and Guilford&lt;ref name="Guilford, J. P. 1967"&gt;Guilford, J. P. (1967). The nature of human intelligence. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; – focused not only on creativity, but also on intelligence. This joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship: researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related, but also how and why.&lt;ref&gt;Plucker, J., &amp; Renzulli, J. S. (1999). Psychometric approaches to the study of human creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 35–60). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple theories accounting for their relationship, with the 3 main theories as follows:

*Threshold Theory – Intelligence is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for creativity. There is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ ~120.&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guilford, J. P. 1967" /&gt;
*Certification Theory – Creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence. Instead, individuals are required to meet the requisite level intelligence in order to gain a certain level of education/work, which then in turn offers the opportunity to be creative. Displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, J. R. (1989). Cognitive processes in creativity. In J. A. Glover, R. R. Ronning, &amp; C. R. Reynolds (Eds.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 135–145). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interference Theory – Extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability.&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996"&gt;Sternberg, R. J. (1996). Successful Intelligence. NewYork: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sternberg and O’Hara&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251"&gt;Sternberg, R. J., &amp; O’Hara, L. A. (1999). Creativity and intelligence. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 251–272). Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a framework of 5 possible relationships between creativity and intelligence:
#Creativity is a subset of intelligence
#Intelligence is a subset of creativity
#Creativity and intelligence are overlapping constructs
#Creativity and intelligence are part of the same construct (coincident sets)
#Creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs (disjoint sets)

=== Creativity as a subset of intelligence ===
A number of researchers include creativity, either explicitly or implicitly, as a key component of intelligence.

''Examples of theories that include creativity as a subset of intelligence''

*Gardner’s  [[Theory of multiple intelligences]] (MIT)&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1993). Creating minds. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; – implicitly includes creativity as a subset of MIT. To demonstrate this, Gardner cited examples of different famous creators, each of whom differed in their types of intelligences e.g. Picasso (spatial intelligence); Freud (intrapersonal); Einstein (logical-mathematical); and Gandhi (interpersonal).
*Sternberg’s Theory of Successful intelligence&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R. J., Kaufman, J. C., &amp; Grigorenko, E. L. (2008). Applied intelligence. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Triarchic theory of intelligence]]) includes creativity as a main component, and comprises 3 sub-theories: Componential (Analytic), Contextual (Practical), and Experiential (Creative). Experiential sub-theory – the ability to use pre-existing knowledge and skills to solve new and novel problems – is directly related to creativity.
*The [[Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory]] includes creativity as a subset of intelligence. Specifically, it is associated with the broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval (Glr). Glr narrow abilities relating to creativity include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaufman | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = S. B. | last3 = Lichtenberger | first3 = E.

New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; extended the CHC-theory in the sense that it was proposed that those individuals who are creative are also selective in their processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process, larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages, and as the individual begins to understand the problem, the processing speed is increased.
*The Dual Process Theory of Intelligence&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, J.C., Kaufman, S.B., &amp; Plucker, J.A. (2013). Contemporary theories of intelligence. In J. Reisberg (Ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Psychology (pp. 811-822). New York, NY: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; posits a two-factor/type model of intelligence. Type 1 is a conscious process, and concerns goal directed thoughts, which are explained by ''g''. Type 2 is an unconscious process, and concerns spontaneous cognition, which encompasses daydreaming and implicit learning ability. Kaufman argues that creativity occurs as a result of Type 1 and Type 2 processes working together in combination. The use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees.

=== Intelligence as a subset of creativity ===
In this relationship model, intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity.

*Sternberg &amp; Lubart’s Investment Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Lubart | first2 = T. I. | year = 1991 | title = An investment theory of creativity and its development | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 1–32 | doi=10.1159/000277029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R.

Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.
*Amabile’s Componential Model of Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amabile | first1 = T. M. | year = 1982 | title = Social psychology of creativity: A consensual assessment technique | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 997–1013 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.5.997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1996). Creativity in context: Update to "The Social Psychology of Creativity". Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, there are 3 within-individual components needed for creativity – domain-relevant skills, creativity-relevant processes, and task motivation – and 1 component external to the individual: their surrounding social environment. Creativity requires a confluence of all components. High creativity will result when an individual is: intrinsically motivated, possesses both a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking, and is working in a highly creative environment.
*Amusement Park Theoretical Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baer | first1 = J. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = J. C. | year = 2005 | title = Bridging generality and specificity: The Amusement Park Theoretical (APT) Model of creativity | url = | journal = Roeper Review | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 158–163 | doi=10.1080/02783190509554310}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this 4-step theory, both domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity. The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels, intelligence plays a key role:
**To get into the amusement park, there are initial requirements (e.g., time/transport to go to the park). Initial requirements (like intelligence) are necessary, but not sufficient for creativity. They are more like prerequisites for creativity, and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement (intelligence), then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour.
**Secondly are the subcomponents – general thematic areas – that increase in specificity. Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit (e.g. a zoo or a water park), these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative (e.g. poetry).
**Thirdly, there are specific domains. After choosing the type of park to visit e.g. waterpark, you then have to choose which specific park to go to. Within the poetry domain, there are many different types (e.g. free verse, riddles, sonnet, etc.) that have to be selected from.
**Lastly, there are micro-domains. These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e.g. individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark.

=== Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs ===
This possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs.

''Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs''

*Renzulli’s Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Renzulli | first1 = J. S. | year = 1978 | title = What makes giftedness? Reexamining a definition | url = | journal = Phi Delta Kappan | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 180–261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this conceptualisation, giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability, creativity, and task commitment. Under this view, creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs, but they do overlap under the correct conditions.
*[[PASS theory of intelligence]]. In this theory, the planning component – relating to the ability to solve problems, make decisions and take action – strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Naglieri | first1 = J.

*Threshold Theory (TT). A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence – both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120. Above this threshold of an IQ of 120, if there is a relationship at all, it is small and weak.&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torrance, E. P. (1962). Guiding creative talent. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity.

In support of the TT, Barron&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barron, F. (1969). Creative person and creative process. New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample; and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample.

Much modern day research reports findings against TT. Wai et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wai | first1 = J. | last2 = Lubinski | first2 = D. | last3 = Benbow | first3 = C. P. | year = 2005 | title = Creativity and occupational accomplishments among intellectually precocious youths: An age 13 to age 33 longitudinal study | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 97 | issue = 3| pages = 484–492 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.97.3.484}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a study using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth – a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood – found that differences in SAT scores at age 13 were predictive of creative real-life outcomes 20 years later. Kim’s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K. H. | year = 2005 | title = Can only intelligent people be creative? | url = | journal = Journal of Secondary Gifted Education | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 57–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meta-analysis of 21 studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT, and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence, creativity, and divergent thinking both below and above IQ's of 120. Preckel et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Preckel | first1 = F. | last2 = Holling | first2 = H. | last3 = Wiese | first3 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Relationship of intelligence and creativity in gifted and non-gifted students: An investigation of threshold theory | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 159–170 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.06.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigating fluid intelligence and creativity, reported small correlations of ''r'' = .3 to ''r'' = .4 across all levels of cognitive ability.

=== Creativity and intelligence as coincident sets ===
Under this view, researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving; and in normal problem solving, there is no need for creativity. Thus, creativity and Intelligence (problem solving) are the same thing. Perkins&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, D. N. (1981) The mind’s best work. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to this as the ‘nothing-special’ view.

Weisberg &amp; Alba&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weisberg | first1 = R. W. | last2 = Alba | first2 = J. W. | year = 1981 | title = An examination of the alleged role of "fixation" in the solution of several "insight" problems | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: General | volume = 110 | issue = 2| pages = 169–192 | doi=10.1037/0096-3445.110.2.169}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined problem solving by having participants complete the 9-dot problem (see [[Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle]]) – where the participants are asked to connect all 9 dots in the 3 rows of 3 dots using 4 straight lines or less, without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice. The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still found it difficult to solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight (or creativity) that is required.

=== Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets ===
In this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs.

Getzels and Jackson&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt; administered 5 creativity measures to a group of 449 children from grades 6-12, and compared these test findings to results from previously administered (by the school) IQ tests. They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was ''r'' = .26. The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures, but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers. The high intelligence group scored the opposite: they scored in the top 20% for IQ, but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity, thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated.

However, this work has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another (to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ), but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills. McNemar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McNemar | first1 = O | year = 1964 | title = Lost: Our Intelligence? Why? | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 19 | issue = 12| pages = 871–882 | doi=10.1037/h0042008}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that there were major measurement issues, in that the IQ scores were a mixture from 3 different IQ tests.

Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; administered 5 measures of creativity, each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency; and 10 measures of general intelligence to 151 5th grade children. These tests were untimed, and given in a game-like manner (aiming to facilitate creativity). Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average ''r'' = .41. Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average ''r'' = .51 with each other. Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated ''r'' = .09.

== Neuroscience ==
The [[neuroscience]] of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour. It has been addressed&lt;ref name="NeuroPsychiatry"&gt;[http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf Kenneth M Heilman, MD, Stephen E. Nadeau, MD, and David Q. Beversdorf, MD. "Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms" Neurocase (2003)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319130652/http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf |date=2009-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the article "Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms." The authors write that "creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected." Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:
* they have a high level of specialized knowledge,
* they are capable of [[convergent and divergent production|divergent thinking]] mediated by the [[frontal lobe]].
* and they are able to modulate [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[norepinephrine]] in their frontal lobe.

Thus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] that is most important for creativity.

This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, [[mood disorder|mood]] and [[substance dependence|addiction disorders]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].

In 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the [[temporal lobe]]s, and [[dopamine]] from the [[limbic system]]. The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general [[arousal]] and goal directed behaviors and reduce [[latent inhibition]], and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Flaherty AW | year = 2005 | title = Frontotemporal and dopaminergic control of idea generation and creative drive | url = | journal = J Comp Neurol | volume = 493 | issue = 1| pages = 147–53 | pmid = 16254989 | pmc = 2571074 | doi=10.1002/cne.20768}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other [[default mode network]] functions.&lt;ref name=PMID_26003860&gt;{{ cite journal |last1 = Mayseless |first1 = Naama |last2 = Eran |first2 = Ayelet |last3 = Shamay-Tsoory |first3 = Simone G |year = 2015 |title = Generating original ideas: The neural underpinning of originality. |journal = NeuroImage |quote = These results are in line with the dual model of creativity, according to which original ideas are a product of the interaction between a system that generates ideas and a control system that evaluates these ideas. |laysummary = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26003860 |doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.030|pmid = 26003860 |pages = 232–9 |volume = 116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working memory and the cerebellum ===
Vandervert&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert 2003a, 2003b; Vandervert, Schimpf &amp; Liu, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the [[cerebellum]] collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of [[working memory]] (responsible for processing all thought&lt;ref&gt;Miyake &amp; Shah, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;) are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum.&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 1997, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The cerebellum (consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Korbo &amp; Pakkenberg, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;) is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency. The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; where creative and innovative thoughts arise.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2003a&lt;/ref&gt; (Apparently, creative insight or the "aha" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.&lt;ref&gt;Jung-Beeman, Bowden, Haberman, Frymiare, Arambel-Liu, Greenblatt, Reber &amp; Kounios, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;)

According to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in "forward" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC).&lt;ref&gt;Imamizu, Kuroda, Miyauchi, Yoshioka &amp; Kawato, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture (HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion,&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 2004,&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the [[child prodigy]], and thought in general.

Essentially, Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, in press-a&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, he has argued that this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2011, in press-b&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert &amp; Vandervert-Weathers, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive "mental prototyping" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven, individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the [[Khan Academy]]. The model proposed by Vandervert has, however, received incisive critique from several authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = J. | year = 2007 | title = On Vandervert et al.

=== REM sleep ===
Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. Sleep aids this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature02223 |author1=Wagner U. |author2=Gais S. |author3=Haider H. |author4=Verleger R. |author5=Born J. | year = 2004 | title = Sleep inspires insight | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 427 | issue = 6972| pages = 352–5 | pmid = 14737168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] rather than [[Non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM sleep]] appears to be responsible.&lt;ref name="Cai"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0900271106 |author1=Cai D.

It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing "neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes."&lt;ref name="Cai" /&gt;

== Affect ==
Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence. As noted in [[voting behavior]], the term "affect" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question. This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making.&lt;ref name=Winkielman2007&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive affect relations ===
According to [[Alice M. Isen|Alice Isen]], positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity:
# Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing, increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association;
# Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context, increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem;
# Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility, increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated. Together, these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity.

[[Barbara Fredrickson]] in her [[broaden-and-build]] model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.

According to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope).

Various meta-analyses, such as Baas et al. (2008) of 66 studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark A.

== Creativity and artificial intelligence ==
[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s formal [[theory]] of creativity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2006 | title = Developmental Robotics, Optimal Artificial Curiosity, Creativity, Music, and the Fine Arts | url = | journal = Connection Science | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 173–187 | doi=10.1080/09540090600768658| citeseerx = 10.1.1.474.6919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2010 | title = Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun, and Intrinsic Motivation (1990–2010) | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 230–247 | doi=10.1109/tamd.2010.2056368}}&lt;/ref&gt; postulates that creativity, curiosity, and interestingness are by-products of a simple [[Computational learning theory|computational]] principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress. Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own [[sensory system|sensory]] inputs. The agent can use a [[black box]] optimization method such as [[reinforcement learning]] to learn (through informed trial and error) sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future [[reward system|reward]] signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when hungry. But Schmidhuber's [[Loss function|objective function]] to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model "wow-effects." This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an [[artificial neural network]] or some other [[machine learning]] device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the difference in computational costs (storage size, number of required synapses, errors, time) needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge, which changes over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present "wow-effect" due to sudden improvements in [[data compression]] or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular, random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are "boring" by nature (providing no reward). Already known and predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration.

According to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of scientists, artists, and [[comedian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Video of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s keynote at the 2011 Winter Intelligence Conference, Oxford: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnbZzcruGu0 Universal AI and Theory of Fun and Creativity.

Youtube, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, [[physicist]]s are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished [[physical law]]s permitting better [[data compression]]. Likewise, composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements.
Similarly, a comedian gets intrinsic reward for "inventing a novel joke with an unexpected [[punch line]], related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data."&lt;ref&gt;Kurzweil AI: [http://www.kurzweilai.net/when-creative-machines-overtake-man Transcript] of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s TEDx talk (2012): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ35zNlyG-o&amp;list=PL194623EBA834DB77&amp;index=11 When creative machines overtake man]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mental health ==
{{Main|Creativity and mental illness}}
A study by psychologist [[J. Philippe Rushton]] found creativity to correlate with [[intelligence]] and [[psychoticism]].&lt;ref&gt;(Rushton, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found creativity to be greater in [[Schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]] than in either normal or [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the [[prefrontal cortex]], schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their ''right'' prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2005.06.016 |pmid=16125369 |url=http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |accessdate=2006-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215212520/http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |archivedate=2006-02-15 |df= |volume=80 |issue=2–3 |title=Verbal creativity and schizotypal personality in relation to prefrontal hemispheric laterality: A behavioral and near-infrared optical imaging study |year=2005 |journal=Schizophrenia Research |pages=271–282 | last1 = Folley | first1 = Bradley S. | last2 = Park | first2 = Sohee|pmc=2817946 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate. In agreement with this hypothesis, [[ambidexterity]] is also associated with [[Schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]] and [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] individuals.

Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and [[mood disorder]]s, particularly [[Bipolar disorder|manic-depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[bipolar disorder]]) and [[Major depressive disorder|depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[Major depressive disorder|unipolar disorder]]). In ''Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament'', [[Kay Redfield Jamison]] summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in [[writer]]s, [[poet]]s, and [[artist]]s. She also explores research that identifies [[mood disorder]]s in such famous writers and artists as [[Ernest Hemingway]] (who shot himself after [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroconvulsive treatment]]), [[Virginia Woolf]] (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer [[Robert Schumann]] (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed [[Visual arts|visual artist]] [[Michelangelo]]. A different case study suggested for Schumann a difference between bipolar disorder and "creative bipolarity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer Matthias|last2=Koutsoukou-Argyraki|first2=Asimina|date=2017|title=Bipolar Disorder and/or Creative Bipolarity: Robert Schumann's Exemplary Psychopathology - Combining Symptomatological and Psychosocial Perspectives with Creativity Research|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/479883|journal=Psychopathology|language=english|volume=50|issue=6|pages=379–388|doi=10.1159/000479883|pmid=29017153|issn=0254-4962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study looking at 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or unipolar depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was no overall overrepresentation, but overrepresentation for artistic occupations, among those diagnosed with schizophrenia. There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kyaga | first1 = S. | last2 = Lichtenstein | first2 = P. | last3 = Boman | first3 = M. | last4 = Hultman | first4 = C. | last5 = Långström | first5 = N. | last6 = Landén | first6 = M. | title = Creativity and mental disorder: Family study of 300 000 people with severe mental disorder | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.085316 | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 199 | issue = 5 | pages = 373–379 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21653945| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another case study suggested a difference between severe mood disorders and "creative melancholy", pointing out mild and moderate depression may inspire creative achievements while severe depression inhibits and may even destroy creative activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer M.|last2=Roussel|first2=Martin|last3=Hofmann|first3=Frank-Hagen|date=2010-12|title=Depression and creativity — The case of the german poet, scientist and statesman J.

Another study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves. Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565"&gt;Roberts, Michelle. Creativity 'closely entwined with mental illness'. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19959565. 16 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as a group, those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people, although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder, including anorexia and, to some extent, autism, the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565" /&gt;

According to psychologist Robert Epstein, PhD, creativity can be obstructed through stress.&lt;ref name="apa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2009/01/creativity.aspx|title=The science of creativity|website=apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creativity and personality ==
Creativity can be expressed in a number of different forms, depending on unique people and environments. A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person. One model suggests that there are kinds to produce growth, innovation, speed, etc. These are referred to as the four "Creativity Profiles" that can help achieve such goals.&lt;ref&gt;(DeGraff, Lawrence 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
:(i) ''Incubate'' (Long-term Development)
:(ii) ''Imagine'' (Breakthrough Ideas)
:(iii) ''Improve'' (Incremental Adjustments)
:(iv) ''Invest'' (Short-term Goals)

Research by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at [[Manchester Business School]] has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each

: (i) "Idea Generation" (Fluency, Originality, Incubation and Illumination)
: (ii) "Personality" (Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity)
: (iii) "Motivation" (Intrinsic, Extrinsic and Achievement)
: (iv) "Confidence" (Producing, Sharing and Implementing)

This model was developed in a sample of 1000 working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling.&lt;ref&gt;(Batey &amp; Irwing, 2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710161255/http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as characterised by the [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] approach, and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nijstad B. A. |author2=De Dreu C. K. | year = 2002 | title = Creativity and Group Innovation | url = | journal = Applied Psychology | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 400–406 | doi = 10.1111/1464-0597.00984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One characteristic of creative people, as measured by some psychologists, is what is called ''divergent production''. ''Divergent production'' is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;(Guilford, 1950)&lt;/ref&gt; One way of measuring ''divergent production'' is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking.&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.

Other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression. Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area, become experts in their fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects.&lt;ref&gt;(Christiaans &amp; Venselaar, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Amabile, 1996; Prabhu et al., 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

From a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Feist, 1998, 1999; Prabhu et al., 2008; Zhang &amp; Sternberg, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people with less creativity.

From an evolutionary perspective, creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas. As ideas are continuously generated, the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments. As a result, people have been creating and developing new, innovative, and creative ideas to build our progress as a society.&lt;ref&gt;(Campbell, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying exceptionally creative people in history, some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people in history usually had supportive parents, but rigid and non-nurturing. Most had an interest in their field at an early age, and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted, allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft, and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination.&lt;ref&gt;(Gardner, 1993a, Policastro &amp; Gardner, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory of creative people is the ''investment theory of creativity''. This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the ''investment'' sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This ''investment theory of creativity'' views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.&lt;ref&gt;(Sternberg &amp; Lubart, 1991, 1995, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malevolent creativity ==
Malevolent creativity (MC) focuses on the "darker side" of creativity.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLaren | first1 = R. B. | year = 1993 | title = The dark side of creativity | url = | journal = Creat. Res. J. | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 137–144 | doi = 10.1080/10400419309534472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and is defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means. MC should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others, whereas MC is explicitly malevolently motivated. MC is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism. However, MC can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying, cheating and betrayal.&lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hao | first1 = N | last2 = Tang | first2 = M | last3 = Yang | first3 = J | last4 = Wang | first4 = Q | last5 = Runco | first5 = MA | year = 2016 | title = A New Tool to Measure Malevolent Creativity: The Malevolent Creativity Behavior Scale | url = | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 682 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00682 | pmid = 27242596 | pmc = 4870273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although everyone shows some levels of MC under certain conditions, those that have a higher propensity towards malevolent creativity have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain. Although levels of MC appear to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions, personality is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking. Researches Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of MC, in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving.  The personality traits of physical aggression, conscientiousness, emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with MC.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"/&gt; Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity, participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions. When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating, those high in implicit aggression, even if they were high in impulsiveness, were far less destructive in their imagined solutions. They concluded premeditation, more than implicit aggression controlled an individual’s expression of malevolent creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = D. J. | last2 = Reiter-Palmon | first2 = R. | year = 2015 | title = Fast and furious: The influence of implicit aggression, premeditation, and provoking situations on malevolent creativity | url = | journal = Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 54–64 | doi = 10.1037/a0038499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current measure for malevolent creativity is the 13 item test Malevolent Creativity Behaviour Scale (MCBS) &lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"/&gt;

===Malevolent creativity and crime===
Malevolent creativity has strong links with crime. As creativity requires deviating from the conventional, there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law. Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity, and studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime.&lt;ref&gt;Aggression: A social psychological analysis.

== Creativity across cultures ==
Creativity is viewed differently in different countries.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg RJ 'Introduction' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (2006) (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' pp 1-9. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, cross-cultural research centred on [[Hong Kong]] found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society.&lt;ref&gt;Niu W (2006) 'Development of Creativity Research in Chinese Societies' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' pp 386-387. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' (the exception being [[Arabic]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 465. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of [[linguistic relativity]], i.e. that language can affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less (or more) creative; [[Africa]] has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as [[music]], [[art]], and [[storytelling]]. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 458. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Preiss DD and Strasser K (2006) 'Creativity in Latin America' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 46. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges,&lt;ref&gt;Smith GJW and Carlsson I (2006) 'Creativity under the Northern Lights' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 202. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Germany, creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems.&lt;ref&gt;Preiser S (2006) 'Creativity Research in German-Speaking Countries' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 175. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In organizations ==
[[File:Training meeting in a ecodesign stainless steel company in brazil.JPG|thumb|right|Training meeting in an eco-design stainless steel company in [[Brazil]]. The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity.]]

It has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself — how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.

Amabile&lt;ref name="Amabile98"&gt;(Amabile, 1998; Sullivan and Harper, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; argued that to enhance creativity in business, three components were needed:
* Expertise (technical, procedural and intellectual knowledge),
* Creative thinking skills (how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems),
* and Motivation (especially [[intrinsic motivation]]).

There are two types of motivation:
* [[Motivation|extrinsic motivation]] – [[Externality|external]] factors, for example [[threat]]s of being fired or money as a reward,
* [[intrinsic motivation]] – comes from inside an individual, satisfaction, enjoyment of work, etc.

Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are:
* Challenge – matching people with the right assignments;
* Freedom – giving people [[autonomy]] choosing means to achieve goals;
* [[Resource]]s – such as time, money, space, etc. There must be balance fit among resources and people;
* Work group features – [[Cultural diversity|diverse]], supportive teams, where members share the excitement, willingness to help, and recognize each other's talents;

Nonaka, who examined several successful Japanese companies, similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations.&lt;ref name="Nonaka91"&gt;(Nonaka, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he emphasized the role that [[tacit knowledge]] has to play in the creative process.

In business, [[originality]] is not enough. The idea must also be appropriate—useful and [[Cause of action|actionable]].&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1998). "How to kill creativity". Harvard Business Review&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siltala, R. 2010. Innovativity and cooperative learning in business life and teaching. University of Turku&lt;/ref&gt; [[Competitive intelligence|Creative competitive intelligence]] is a new solution to solve this problem. According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to [[innovation]] process and [[competitive intelligence]] to creative workers.

Creativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace. It is essential for innovation, and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses. In 2013, the sociologist Silvia Leal Martín, using the Innova 3DX method, suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation: corporate culture, work environment, leadership and management, creativity, self-esteem and optimism, locus of control and learning orientation, motivation, and fear.&lt;ref&gt;Leal, S. y Urrea J.

Similarly, social psychologists, organizational scientists, and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition, team processes, and organizational culture, as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodman | first1 = R.

The investigation by Loo (2017) &lt;ref&gt;Loo, S. (2017) Creative Working in the Knowledge Economy. Abingdon, Oxfordshire: Routledge Ltd. {{ISBN|9781138211391}}; {{ISBN|9781315453095}}. https://www.routledge.com/Creative-Working-in-the-Knowledge-Economy/Loo/p/book/9781138211391&lt;/ref&gt; on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page. It offers connections with the sections on the ‘”Four C” model’, ‘Theories of creative processes’, ‘Creativity as a subset of intelligence’, ‘Creativity and personality’, and ‘In organisations’ It is the last section that the investigation addresses.

Research studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels: macro, meso and micro. Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension. Meso studies focus on organisations. Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers. There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses (e.g. Burton-Jones, 1999; Drucker, 1999), economics (e.g. Cortada, 1998; Reich, 2001; Florida, 2003), education (e.g. Farrell and Fenwick, 2007; Brown, Lauder and Ashton, 2011), human resource management (e.g. Davenport, 2005), knowledge and organizational management (Alvesson, 2004; Defillippi, Arthur and Lindsay, 2006; Orr, Nutley, Russell, Bain, Hacking and Moran, 2016), sociology, psychology, and knowledge economy-related sectors – especially information technology (IT) software (e.g. O’Riain, 2004; Nerland, 2008) and advertising (e.g. Grabher, 2004; Lury, 2004) (Loo, 2017).

Loo (2017) studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors. It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England, Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives. Specifically, the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting (in advertising), and systems software developing and software programme managing.

The study offers a conceptual framework (Loo, 2017, p.&amp;nbsp;49) of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles, and single and multi-contexts. The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics (e.g. Reich, 2001; Quah, 2002), management (e.g. ,Drucker, 1994; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; von Hippel, 2006), sociology (e.g. Zuboff, 1988; Bell, 1973; Lash and Urry, 1994; Castells, 2000; Knorr Cetina, 2005),  and psychology (e.g. Gardner, 1984; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Sternberg, Kaufman and Pretz, 2004). The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work.  These workers apply their cognitive abilities, creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science, technology, or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities – e.g. a medium, product or service. These work activities may be done individually or collectively. Education, training and ‘encultured environments’ are necessary for the performance of these creative activities. Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person, seeking novelty when reviewing a situation (Gardner, 1993), and creating something that is different and novel, i.e. a ‘variation’ on the idea of existing ideas in a domain (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives.

This investigation identifies a definition of creative work, three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur. These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination, problem-solving, problem seeking, and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities. Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example, for a creative director in the advertising industry, it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens, and for a software programmer, it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written. There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector, and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector. In addition to the creative applications, creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles. Passion for one’s job is generic. For copywriters, this passion is identified with fun, enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty (regarding the product), confidence, and patience in finding the appropriate copy. Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities (e.g. literature), the creative arts (e.g. painting and music) and technical-related know-how (e.g. mathematics, computer sciences and physical sciences). In the IT software, technical knowledge of computer languages (e.g. C++) is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager, as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers.

There are three types of work. One is intra-sectoral (e.g. ‘general sponge’ and ’in tune with the zeitgeist’ [advertising], and ‘power of expression’ and ‘sensitivity’ [IT software]). The second is inter-sectoral (e.g. ‘integration of advertising activities’ [advertising], and ‘autonomous decentralized systems’ [ADS] [IT software]). The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors (e.g. ‘three-dimensional trust’ and ‘green credentials’ [advertising], and ‘collaboration with HEIs and industry’ and ‘ADS system in the Tokyo train operator’ [IT software]).

The necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information, communications and electronic technologies (ICET) infrastructure, training, work environment and education.

This investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally. Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities, arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure, delivery approaches and assessments. At a macro level, governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities, outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising. This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working, offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development (formally and informally), and foster an environment, which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation.

'''[[Team Composition]]'''

Diversity between team members’ backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = A different perspective: The multiple effects of deep level diversity on group creativity | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 5| pages = 822–832 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2013.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paletz | first1 = S.

'''Team Processes'''

Team communication [[norm (social)|norm]]s, such as respecting others’ expertise, paying attention to others’ ideas, expecting information sharing, tolerating disagreements, [[negotiation|negotiating]], remaining open to others’ ideas, learning from others, and building on each other’s ideas, increase team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with [[brainstorming]] and [[problem solving]]. Through these processes, team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge, reach shared understandings, identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks, and make new connections between ideas. Engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], which facilitates collective creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Organizational culture|'''Organizational Culture''']]

Supportive and motivational environments that create [[psychological safety]] by encouraging risk taking and tolerating mistakes increase team creativity as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Organizations in which [[help-seeking]], [[Helping behavior|help giving]], and [[collaboration]] are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargadon | first1 = A.

==Economic views of creativity==
Economic approaches to creativity have focussed on three aspects — the impact of creativity on economic growth, methods of modelling markets for creativity, and the maximisation of economic creativity (innovation).

In the early 20th century, [[Joseph Schumpeter]] introduced the economic theory of ''[[creative destruction]]'', to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new. Some economists (such as [[Paul Romer]]) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and creative products are protected by [[intellectual property]] laws.

[[Mark A. Runco]] and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a "[[Behavioral economics|psychoeconomic]]" model of creativity.&lt;ref name="RubRunc1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90021-Q|last=Rubenson|first=Daniel L.|author2=Runco, Mark |authorlink2=Mark A. Runco |title=The psychoeconomic approach to creativity|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=131–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such a model, creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity; the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity. Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive [[utility]], and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations.&lt;ref name="Diamond1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90023-S|last=Diamond|first=Arthur M.|title=Creativity and Interdisciplinarity: A Response to Rubenson and Runco|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[creative class]]'' is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies. In his 2002 book, ''The Rise of the Creative Class'', [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]] popularized the notion that regions with "3 T's of economic development: Technology, Talent and Tolerance" also have high concentrations of [[creative professional]]s and tend to have a higher level of economic development.

==Fostering creativity==
{{Main|Creativity techniques}}

Several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Such ideas range from the [[Psychology|psychological]]-cognitive, such as [[Alex Faickney Osborn|Osborn]]-[[Sid Parnes|Parnes]] [[Creative_problem-solving|Creative Problem Solving Process]], [[Synectics]], science-based creative thinking, Purdue Creative Thinking Program, and [[Edward de Bono]]'s [[lateral thinking]]; to the highly structured, such as [[TRIZ]] (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (developed by the Russian scientist [[Genrich Altshuller]]), and Computer-Aided [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]].

Daniel Pink, in his 2005 book ''A Whole New Mind'', repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this ''conceptual age'', we will need to foster and encourage ''right-directed thinking'' (representing creativity and emotion) over ''left-directed thinking'' (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/lives-the-brain/201004/creativity-the-brain-and-evolution|title=Creativity, the Brain, and Evolution|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sternberg|chapter=Enhancing creativity|editor-link=Robert Sternberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed. These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry:
# Establishing purpose and intention
# Building basic skills
# Encouraging acquisitions of domain-specific knowledge
# Stimulating and rewarding curiosity and exploration
# Building motivation, especially internal motivation
# Encouraging confidence and a willingness to take risks
# Focusing on mastery and self-competition
# Promoting supportable beliefs about creativity
# Providing opportunities for choice and discovery
# Developing self-management (metacognitive skills)
# Teaching techniques and strategies for facilitating creative performance
# Providing balance

==Creativity and education policies==

Some see the conventional system of [[education|schooling]] as "stifling" of creativity and attempt (particularly in the [[preschool]]/[[kindergarten]] and early school years) to provide a creativity-friendly, rich, imagination-fostering environment for young children.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name="Csik99handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Csíkszentmihályi|first=Mihály|title=Handbook of Creativity|year=1999|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|editor=R. J. Sternberg|chapter=Implications of a systems perspective for the study of creativity|authorlink=Mihály Csíkszentmihályi|editor-link=Robert Sternberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RobAzzam2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=K.|author2=Azzam, A. M.|title=Why creativity now?|journal=Educational Leadership|year=2009|volume=67|issue=1|pages=22–26|authorlink=Ken Robinson (British author)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing our society at an unprecedented rate and creative problem solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise.&lt;ref name=RobAzzam2009 /&gt; In addition to helping with problem solving, creativity also helps students identify problems where others have failed to do so.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name= Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paris, C., Edwards, N., Sheffield, E., Mutinsky, M., Olexa, T., Reilly, S., &amp; Baer, J.

New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; See the Waldorf School as an example of an education program that promotes creative thought.

Promoting intrinsic motivation and problem solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake.&lt;ref name=Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=RobAzzam2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name="ByrgeHanson2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byrge|first=C.|author2=Hanson.

(1993). Evolution and flow. In M. Csikszentmihalyi (Ed.), The evolving self: A psychology for the third millennium (pp. 175–206). New York: Harper Perennial.&lt;/ref&gt; To promote creative thinking, educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural Education (1998). All our futures: Creativity, culture, and education. UK: NACCCE&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity. This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them, possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name= RobAzzam2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ByrgeHanson2009 /&gt; In adults, mentoring individuals is another way to foster their creativiy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The manifesto : a guide to developing a creative career|last=Torrance|first=E.

===Scotland===
In the [[Education in Scotland|Scottish education system]], creativity is identified as a core skillset for learning, life and work and is defined as “a process which generates ideas that have value to the individual.  It involves looking at familiar things with a fresh eye, examining problems with an open mind, making connections, learning from mistakes and using imagination to explore new possibilities.” [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/practice-exemplars/Creativity%203-18%20curriculum%20review%20(impact%20report)] The need to develop a shared language and understanding of creativity and its role across every aspect of learning, teaching and continuous improvement was identified as a necessary aim [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/Creative%20Learning%20Networks] and a set of four skills is used to allow educators to discuss and develop creativity skills across all subjects and sectors of education – curiosity, open—mindedness, imagination and problem solving. [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/What%20are%20creativity%20skills?] Distinctions are made between creative learning (when learners are using their creativity skills), creative teaching (when educators are using their creativity skills) and creative change (when creativity skills are applied to planning and improvement). [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/documents/creativity/cre24_infographics/cre24-the-big-picture.pdf] Scotland’s national Creative Learning Plan [http://www.creativescotland.com/resources/our-publications/plans-and-strategy-documents/scotlands-creative-learning-plan-2013] supports the development of creativity skills in all learners and of educators’ expertise in developing creativity skills. A range of resources have been created to support and assess this [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/Pages/Search.aspx?k=Creativity%20infographics] including a national review of creativity across learning by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate for Education. [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/practice-exemplars/Creativity%203-18%20curriculum%20review%20(impact%20report)]

===United States===
Creativity has also been identified as one of the key [[21st century skills]] and as one of the  [[Four Cs of 21st century learning]] by educational leaders and theorists in the United States.

'''David Hume''' ({{IPAc-en|h|juː|m}}; born '''David Home'''; 7 May 1711 [[New Style|NS]] &lt;small&gt;(26 April 1711 [[Old Style|OS]])&lt;/small&gt; – 25 August 1776) was a [[Scottish Enlightenment]] [[philosopher]], [[historian]], [[economist]], and [[essayist]], who is best known today for his highly influential system of philosophical [[empiricism]], [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]], and [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]].&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; Hume's empiricist approach to philosophy places him with [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] as a [[British Empiricism|British Empiricist]].{{sfn|Atherton|1999|p= ?}} Beginning with his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' (1739), Hume strove to create a total naturalistic [[science of man]] that examined the psychological basis of human nature. Against philosophical [[rationalism|rationalists]], Hume held that passion rather than reason governs human behaviour. Hume argued against the existence of [[innatism|innate ideas]], positing that all human knowledge is founded solely in [[experience]]; Hume thus held that genuine knowledge must either be directly traceable to objects perceived in experience, or result from abstract reasoning about [[Relation of Ideas|relations between ideas]] which are derived from experience, calling the rest "nothing but sophistry and illusion",{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=166}} a [[dichotomy]] later given the name ''[[Hume's fork]]''.

In what is sometimes referred to as [[Hume's problem of induction]], he argued that [[inductive reasoning]] and belief in [[causality]] cannot be justified rationally; instead, our trust in causality and induction result from custom and mental habit, and are attributable only to the experience of "[[constant conjunction]]" of events.  This is because we can never actually perceive that one event causes another, but only that the two are always conjoined.  Accordingly, to draw any causal inferences from past experience it is necessary to presuppose that the future will resemble the past, a presupposition which cannot itself be grounded in prior experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9980.html|title=Berlin, I.; Hardy, H.,: The Roots of Romanticism (Second edition) (eBook and Paperback).|work=princeton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's opposition to the [[teleological argument]] for God's existence, the argument from design, is generally regarded as the most intellectually significant attempt to rebut the argument prior to [[Darwinism]].

Hume was also a [[Moral sense theory|sentimentalist]] who held that ethics are based on emotion or sentiment rather than abstract moral principle, famously proclaiming that [[Fact–value distinction|"Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions"]]. Hume's moral theory has been seen as a unique attempt to synthesise the modern sentimentalist moral tradition to which Hume belonged, with the [[virtue ethics]] tradition of [[ancient philosophy]], with which Hume concurred in regarding traits of character, rather than [[deontological ethics|acts]] or their [[consequentialism|consequences]], as ultimately the proper objects of moral evaluation.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Hume.html?id=2_FiLAAACAAJ|title=Hume|work=google.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume maintained an early commitment to naturalistic explanations of moral phenomena, and is usually taken to have first clearly expounded the [[is–ought problem]], or the idea that a statement of fact alone can never give rise to a [[norm (philosophy)|normative]] conclusion of what ''ought'' to be done.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"/&gt; Hume also denied that humans have an actual conception of the self, positing that we experience only  a [[bundle theory|bundle of sensations]], and that the self is nothing more than this bundle of causally-connected perceptions. Hume's [[Compatibilism|compatibilist]] theory of [[free will]] takes [[determinism|causal determinism]] as fully compatible with human freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-freewill/|title=Hume on Free Will|work=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume influenced [[utilitarianism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Immanuel Kant]], the [[philosophy of science]], early [[analytic philosophy]], [[cognitive science]], [[theology]], and other movements and thinkers. Kant himself credited Hume as the spur to his philosophical thought who had awakened him from his "dogmatic slumbers".

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Hume was the second of two sons born to Joseph Home of [[Chirnside#Ninewells House|Ninewells]], an advocate, and his wife The Hon. Katherine (''née'' Falconer), daughter of Sir David Falconer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/humelife.html|title=David Hume, "My Own Life"|author=|date=|website=andromeda.rutgers.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born on 26 April 1711 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]) in a tenement on the north side of the [[Lawnmarket]] in [[Edinburgh]].  Hume's father died when Hume was a child, just after his second birthday, and he was raised by his mother, who never remarried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humesociety.org/about/HumeBiography.asp|title=David Hume Biography|work=humesociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He changed the spelling of his name in 1734, because of the fact that his surname ''Home,'' pronounced ''Hume,'' was not known in England. Throughout his life Hume, who never married, spent time occasionally at his family home at Ninewells in [[Berwickshire]], which had belonged to his family since the sixteenth century. His finances as a young man were very "slender". His family was not rich, and, as a younger son, he had little [[wikt:patrimony|patrimony]] to live on. He was therefore forced to make a living somehow.{{sfn|Hume|1778|p=3}}

Hume attended the [[University of Edinburgh]] at the unusually early age of 12 (possibly as young as 10) at a time when 14 was normal. At first, because of his family, he considered a career in [[Scots law|law]], but came to have, in his words, "an insurmountable aversion to everything but the pursuits of Philosophy and general Learning; and while [my family] fanceyed I was poring over [[Johannes Voet|Voet]] and [[Arnold Vinnius|Vinnius]], [[Cicero]] and [[Virgil]] were the Authors which I was secretly devouring".{{sfn|Hume|1778|p=3}} He had little respect for the professors of his time, telling a friend in 1735 that "there is nothing to be learnt from a Professor, which is not to be met with in Books".{{sfn|Mossner|1958|pp=30–33|ps=, quoted in {{harvtxt|Wright|2009|p=10}}}} Hume did not graduate.{{sfn|Harris|2004|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=K2ygCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=Hume+did+not+graduate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sc4E8eb4Ij&amp;sig=4SSQXHoO4QmiGKJuz-dyzgGSxxU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxp769u4vKAhUIhhoKHSs9BqcQ6AEIHzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hume%20did%20not%20graduate&amp;f=false p. 35]}}

Aged around 18, he made a philosophical discovery that opened up to him "a new Scene of Thought", which inspired him "to throw up every other Pleasure or Business to apply entirely to it".{{sfn|Hume|1993|p=346}} He did not recount what this scene was, and commentators have offered a variety of speculations.{{Sfn|Johnson|1995|pp=8–9}} One popular interpretation, prominent in contemporary Hume scholarship, is that the new "scene of thought" was Hume's realization that [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson's]] "moral sense" theory of morality could be applied to the understanding as well. Due to this inspiration, Hume set out to spend a minimum of 10 years reading and writing. He soon came to the verge of a [[mental breakdown]], suffering from what a doctor diagnosed as the "Disease of the Learned". Hume wrote that it started with a coldness, which he attributed to a "Laziness of Temper", that lasted about nine months. Later, some [[scurvy]] spots broke out on his fingers. This was what persuaded Hume's physician to make his diagnosis. Hume wrote that he "went under a Course of Bitters and Anti-Hysteric Pills", taken along with a pint of claret every day. Hume also decided to have a more active life to better continue his learning.{{sfn|Mossner|1950|p=193}} His health improved somewhat, but, in 1731, he was afflicted with a ravenous appetite and palpitations of the heart. After eating well for a time, he went from being "tall, lean and raw-bon'd" to being "sturdy, robust [and] healthful-like".{{sfn|Hume|2011|pp=13–15}} Indeed, Hume would become well known in his time for his "corpulence", and his fondness for good port and cheese.

===Career===
At 25 years of age, Hume, although of noble ancestry, had no source of income and no learned profession. As was common at his time, he became a merchant's assistant, but he had to leave his native Scotland. He travelled via [[Bristol]] to [[La Flèche]] in Anjou, France. There he had frequent discourse with the [[Jesuits]] of the [[College of La Flèche]].{{sfn|Huxley|2011|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=eH67vOxyjEYC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=hume+travelling+tutorship&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eBOIVMH_K4nvUvflg-gG&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20travelling%20tutorship&amp;f=false pp. 7–8]}}

While Hume was derailed in his attempts to start a university career by protests over his "[[atheism]]" and bemoaned that his literary debut, ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', 'fell dead-born from the press',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidhume.org/texts/mol.html|title=Texts - My Own Life (1777)|work=davidhume.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; he found literary success in his lifetime as an essayist, and a career as a librarian at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. His tenure there, and the access to research materials it provided, ultimately resulted in Hume's writing the massive six-volume ''[[The History of England (Hume)|The History of England]]'', which became a bestseller and the standard history of England in its day. Hume described his "love for literary fame" as his "ruling passion"&lt;ref name="davidhume.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidhume.org/texts/mol.html|title=Texts - My Own Life (1777)|work=davidhume.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and judged his two late works, the so-called "first" and "second" enquiries, ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'' and ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'', respectively, as his greatest literary and philosophical achievements,&lt;ref name="davidhume.org" /&gt; asking his contemporaries to judge him on the merits of the later texts alone, rather than the more radical formulations of his early, youthful work, dismissing his philosophical debut as [[juvenilia]]: "A work which the Author had projected before he left College."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidhume.org/texts/etv2.html|title=Texts - Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects, vol. 2 (1777)|work=davidhume.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Hume's protestations, a general consensus exists today that Hume's most important arguments and philosophically distinctive doctrines are found in the original form they take in the ''Treatise''. Hume was just 23 years old when he started this work and it is now regarded as one of the most important in the history of [[Western philosophy]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au" /&gt;

He worked for four years on his first major work, ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', subtitled "Being an Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects", completing it in 1738 at the age of 28. Although many scholars today consider the ''Treatise'' to be Hume's most important work and one of the most important books in Western philosophy, the critics in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] at the time did not agree, describing it as "abstract and unintelligible".{{sfn|Mossner|1950|p=195}} As Hume had spent most of his savings during those four years,{{sfn|Mossner|1950|p=193}} he resolved "to make a very rigid frugality supply my deficiency of fortune, to maintain unimpaired my independency, and to regard every object as contemptible except the improvements of my talents in literature".{{sfn|Hume|1993|p=352}} Despite the disappointment, Hume later wrote, "Being naturally of a cheerful and [[Humorism|sanguine]] temper, I soon recovered from the blow and prosecuted with great ardour my studies in the country."{{sfn|Hume|1993|p=352}} There, in an attempt to make his larger work better known and more intelligible, he published the ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature (Abstract)|An Abstract of a Book lately Published]]'' as a summary of the main doctrines of the ''Treatise'', without revealing its authorship.{{sfn|Hume|1740}} Although there has been some academic speculation as to who actually wrote this pamphlet{{sfn|Norton|1993|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vv5ERpFQBCoC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=hume+abstract+author&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=70ODVLXoM4r_UIDpgNgP&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20abstract%20author&amp;f=false p. 31]}} it is generally regarded as Hume's creation.{{sfn|Redman|1997|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=1faeMedY8k8C&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=An+Abstract+of+a+Book+lately+Published;+Entitled&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XRryVP6yCYX6ygPViYDABg&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=An%20Abstract%20of%20a%20Book%20lately%20Published%3B%20Entitled&amp;f=false p. 175, footnote 19]}}

After the publication of ''Essays Moral and Political'' in 1741, which was included in the later edition called ''[[Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary]]'', Hume applied for the Chair of Pneumatics and Moral Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. However, the position was given to [[William Cleghorn]]{{sfn|Nobbs|1965|p=575}} after Edinburgh ministers petitioned the town council not to appoint Hume because he was seen as an [[atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume-rel/ |title=Hume, David: Religion &amp;#124; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:David Hume 1754.jpeg|thumb|left|An engraving of Hume from the first volume of his ''The History of England'', 1754]]
During the 1745 [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite rising]], Hume tutored the [[George Vanden-Bempde, 3rd Marquess of Annandale|Marquess of Annandale]] (1720–92), who was "judged to be a lunatic".{{sfn|Mossner|1950|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7HXJAqqNl4QC&amp;pg=PA378&amp;dq=annandale+lunatic+hume&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bxWIVPykIYHtUtevgvAI&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=annandale%20lunatic%20hume&amp;f=false p. 172]}} This engagement ended in disarray after about a year. However, it was then that Hume started his great historical work ''[[The History of England (Hume)|The History of England]]''. This took him fifteen years and ran to over a million words. During this time he was also involved with the Canongate Theatre through his friend [[John Home]], a preacher.{{sfn|Fieser|2005|loc=[https://www.google.co.uk/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=canongate+theatre&amp;gws_rd=ssl#hl=en&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=canongate+theatre+hume+fieser p. xxii]}}

In this context, he associated with [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo|Lord Monboddo]] and other [[Scottish Enlightenment]] luminaries in Edinburgh. From 1746, Hume served for three years as secretary to General [[James St Clair]], who was envoy to the courts of [[Turin]] and [[Vienna]]. At that time Hume also wrote ''Philosophical Essays Concerning Human Understanding'', later published as ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]''. Often called the ''First Enquiry'', it proved little more successful than the ''Treatise'', perhaps because of the publishing of his short autobiography, ''My Own Life'', which "made friends difficult for the first Enquiry".{{sfn|Buckle|1999|p= ?}}
In 1749 he went to live with his brother in the countryside.

Hume's religious views were often suspect. It was necessary in the 1750s for his friends to avert a trial against him on the charge of [[heresy in Christianity|heresy]]. However, he "would not have come and could not be forced to attend if he said he was not a member of the Established Church".{{sfn|Emerson|2009|p=244}} Hume failed to gain the [[Professor of Moral Philosophy (Glasgow)|chair of philosophy]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] for his religious views, too. He had published the ''[[Philosophical Essays]]'' by this time which were decidedly anti-religious. Even [[Adam Smith]], his personal friend who had vacated the Glasgow philosophy chair, was against his appointment out of concern public opinion would be against it.{{sfn|Rivers|2000|p=255}}

Hume returned to Edinburgh in 1751. In the following year "the Faculty of Advocates chose me their Librarian, an office from which I received little or no emolument, but which gave me the command of a large library".{{sfn|Hume|1778|p=11}} This resource enabled him to continue historical research for ''The History of England''. Hume's volume of ''Political Discourses'', written in 1749 and published by Kincaid &amp; [[Alexander Donaldson (bookseller)|Donaldson]] in 1752,{{sfn|Sher|2008|p=312}} was the only work he considered successful on first publication.{{sfn|Hume|1778|p=10}}

Eventually, with the publication of his six-volume ''The History of England'' between 1754 and 1762, Hume achieved the fame that he coveted.{{sfn|Emerson|2009|p=98}} The volumes traced events from the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Invasion of Julius Caesar]] to the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]], and was a bestseller in its day.

Hume was also a longtime friend of bookseller [[Andrew Millar]], who sold Hume's ''History'' (after acquiring the rights from Scottish bookseller Gavin Hamilton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk/manuscripts/html_output/2.html|title=The manuscripts, Letter from David Hume to Andrew Millar, 12 April, 1755.|website=www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;), although the relationship was sometimes complicated. Letters between them illuminate both men's interest in the success of the ''History''.

===Later years===
[[File:Old Calton David Hume.jpg|thumb|David Hume's mausoleum by [[Robert Adam]]]]
From 1763 to 1765, Hume was invited to attend [[Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford|Lord Hertford]] in [[Paris]], where he became secretary to the British embassy.&lt;ref&gt;Klibansky, Raymond and Mossner, Ernest C. (eds.) (1954). ''New Letters of David Hume''.

Texas Studies in Literature and Language, 12(3), 417–430. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/40754109&lt;/ref&gt; In 1766, Hume left Paris to accompany [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] to England.  Once in England, Hume and Rousseau fell out.&lt;ref name=wsj11042017&gt;"An Enlightened Friendship", Ruth Scurr, Wall Street Journal, November 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Hume was sufficiently worried about the damage to his reputation from the quarrel with Rousseau (who is generally believed to have suffered from [[paranoia]]) to have authored an account of the dispute, which he titled, appropriately enough ''"A concise and genuine account of the dispute between Mr. Hume and Mr. Rousseau."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/concisegenuineac00hume|title=A concise and genuine account of the dispute between Mr. Hume and Mr. Rousseau : with the letters that passed between them during their controversy.

Edinburgh: Edinburgh Bibliographical Society, 2014, p.65-69; http://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/all-his-remedies/ (paywall)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1767, Hume was appointed Under Secretary of State for the Northern Department. Here he wrote that he was given "all the secrets of the Kingdom". In 1769 he returned to James' Court in Edinburgh, and then lived, from 1771 until his death in 1776, at the southwest corner of St. Andrew's Square in Edinburgh's [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]], at what is now 21 Saint David Street.{{sfn|Burton|1846|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CDYfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA384&amp;dq=hume+1767&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gUSIVLzvGIbmUsephJgK&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%201767&amp;f=false p. 384–385]}} A popular story, consistent with some historical evidence, suggests the street may have been named after Hume.{{sfn|Burton|1846|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=CDYfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA384&amp;dq=hume+1767&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gUSIVLzvGIbmUsephJgK&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=%22david%20street%22&amp;f=false p. 436, footnote 1]}}

In the last year of his life, Hume wrote an extremely brief autobiographical essay titled "My Own Life"&lt;ref name="andromeda.rutgers.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/humelife.html|title=David Hume, "My Own Life"|work=rutgers.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; which summed up his entire life in "fewer than 5 pages",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oliveschreinerletters.ed.ac.uk/StanleyHumePersona.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and notably contains many interesting judgments that have been of enduring interest to subsequent readers of Hume.&lt;ref name="scholarcommons.sc.edu"&gt;http://scholarcommons.sc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1130&amp;context=ssl&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00048409912348781?journalCode=rajp20#.VcvMJHjeJBU|title= Hume's biography and Hume's philosophy| doi=10.1080/00048409912348781 | volume=77|journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy|pages=1–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar of 18th-century literature Donald Seibert judged it a "remarkable autobiography, even though it may lack the usual attractions of that genre. Anyone hankering for startling revelations or amusing anecdotes had better look elsewhere."&lt;ref name="scholarcommons.sc.edu"/&gt;  Hume here confesses his belief that the "love of literary fame" had served as his "ruling passion" in life, and claims that this desire "never soured my temper, notwithstanding my frequent disappointments." One such disappointment Hume discusses in the mini-autobiography was his disappointment that  with the initial literary reception of the ''Treatise'', which he claims to have overcome by means of the success of the ''Essays'': "the work was favourably received, and soon made me entirely forget my former disappointment". Hume, in his own retrospective judgment, suggested that his philosophical debut's apparent failure "had proceeded more from the manner than the matter." Hume thus suggests that  "I had been guilty of a very usual indiscretion, in going to the press too early." Hume provides an unambiguous self-assessment of the relative value of his works: "my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals; which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that subject) is of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or literary, incomparably the best."  Hume also makes a number of self-assessments in the essay, writing of his social relations that "My company was not unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as to the studious and literary", noting of his complex relation to religion, as well as the state, that "though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury", and professing of his character that "My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct." Hume concludes the essay with the frank admission: " I cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself, but I hope it is not a misplaced one; and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained."&lt;ref name="andromeda.rutgers.edu"/&gt;

Diarist and biographer [[James Boswell]] saw Hume a few weeks before his death, which was from some form of abdominal cancer. Hume told him he sincerely believed it a "most unreasonable fancy" that there might be life after death.{{sfn|Boswell|1970|p= ?}} This meeting was dramatised in semi-fictional form for the [[BBC]] by [[Michael Ignatieff]] as ''Dialogue in the Dark''.{{sfn|Bassett|2012|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MkTSD5UHu8AC&amp;pg=PA272&amp;dq=dark+hume+Michael+Ignatieff&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YEuIVIzbEseqUbzng_gP&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=dark%20hume%20Michael%20Ignatieff&amp;f=false p. 272]}} Hume asked that his body be interred in a "simple Roman tomb". In his will he requests that it be inscribed only with his name and the year of his birth and death, "leaving it to Posterity to add the Rest".{{sfn|Mossner|1980|p=591}} It stands, as he wished it, on the southwestern slope of [[Calton Hill]], in the [[Old Calton Cemetery]]. Adam Smith later recounted Hume's amusing speculation that he might ask [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] to allow him a few more years of life in order to see "the downfall of some of the prevailing systems of superstition." The ferryman replied, "You loitering rogue, that will not happen these many hundred years&amp;nbsp;... Get into the boat this instant".{{sfn|Hume|1789|p=xxi}}

==Writings==
In the introduction to ''A Treatise of Human Nature'', Hume wrote, "'Tis evident, that all the sciences have a relation, more or less, to human nature&amp;nbsp;... Even Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Natural Religion, are in some measure dependent on the science of Man." He also wrote that the [[science of man]] is the "only solid foundation for the other sciences" and that the method for this science requires both experience and observation as the foundations of a logical argument.{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=7}} On this aspect of Hume's thought, philosophical historian [[Frederick Copleston]] wrote that it was Hume's aim to apply to the science of man the method of experimental philosophy (the term that was current at the time to imply [[Natural philosophy]]), and that "Hume's plan is to extend to philosophy in general the methodological limitations of [[classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]]".{{sfn|Copleston|1999|pp=405–406}}

Until recently, Hume was seen as a forerunner of [[logical positivism]]; a form of anti-[[metaphysics|metaphysical]] empiricism. According to the logical positivists, unless a statement could be verified by experience, or else was true or false by definition (i.e. either [[tautology (logic)|tautological]] or [[contradiction|contradictory]]), then it was meaningless (this is a summary statement of their [[verificationism|verification principle]]). Hume, on this view, was a proto-positivist, who, in his philosophical writings, attempted to demonstrate how ordinary propositions about objects, causal relations, the self, and so on, are [[logical equivalence|semantically equivalent]] to propositions about one's experiences.{{sfn|Ayer|1946|p=40}}{{failed verification|date=March 2015}}

Many commentators have since rejected this understanding of Humean empiricism, stressing an [[epistemology|epistemological]] (rather than a [[semantics|semantic]]) reading of his project.&lt;ref name=CSW&gt;See e.g. {{harvtxt|Craig|1987|loc=Ch. 2}}, {{harvtxt|Strawson|2014|p= ?}}, and {{harvtxt|Wright|1983|p= ?}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this opposing view, Hume's empiricism consisted in the idea that it is our knowledge, and not our ability to conceive, that is restricted to what can be experienced. Hume thought that we can form beliefs about that which extends beyond any possible experience, through the operation of faculties such as custom and the imagination, but he was sceptical about claims to knowledge on this basis.

===Impressions and ideas===

One of the most central doctrines of Hume's philosophy, stated in the very first lines of the ''Treatise'', is his notion that the mind consists of its mental perceptions, or the mental objects which are present to it, and which divide into two categories: ''impressions'' and ''ideas''. Hume's Treatise thus opens with the words: 'All the perceptions of the human mind resolve themselves into two distinct kinds, which I shall call IMPRESSIONS and IDEAS."  Hume states that "I believe it will not be very necessary to employ many words in explaining this distinction" and commentators have generally taken Hume to mean the distinction between [[feeling]] and [[thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cognition-and-commitment-in-humes-philosophy-9780195159592?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Cognition and Commitment in Hume's Philosophy|work=oup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversially, Hume may regard the difference as in some sense a matter of degree, as he takes "impressions" to be distinguished from ideas, on the basis of their force, liveliness, and vivacity, or what Henry Allison calls the "FLV criterion" in his book on Hume.&lt;ref name="global.oup.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/custom-and-reason-in-hume-9780199532889?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Custom and Reason in Hume|work=oup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas are therefore "faint" impressions. For example, experiencing the painful sensation of touching the handle of a hot pan is more forceful than simply thinking about touching a hot pan.  According to Hume, impressions are meant to be the original form of all our ideas, and Don Garret has thus coined the term "the copy principle" to refer to Hume's doctrine that all ideas are ultimately all copied from some original impression, whether it be a passion or sensation, from which they derive.&lt;ref name="global.oup.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/products/9780415283342|title=Hume|date=30 October 2014|work=routledge.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After establishing the forcefulness of impressions and ideas, these two categories are further broken down into simple and complex: simple impressions and ideas, and complex impressions and ideas. Hume states that “simple perceptions or impressions and ideas are such as admit of no distinction nor separation,” while “the complex are the contrary to these, and may be distinguished into parts.”&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (1896). A Treatise of Human Nature (L. A. Selby-Bigge, Ed.). Wotton-under-Edge: Oxford: Clarendon Press. Retrieved May 4, 2017, from Center for Security Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at an apple, a person experiences a variety of color-sensations, which Hume sees as a complex impression. Similarly, a person experiences a variety of taste-sensations, tactile-sensations, and smell-sensations when biting into an apple, with the overall sensation again being a complex impression. Thinking about an apple allows a person to form complex ideas, which are made of similar parts as the complex impressions they were developed from, but which are also less forceful. Hume believes that complex perceptions can be broken down into smaller and smaller parts until perceptions are reached that have no parts of their own, and these perceptions are thereby referred to as being simple.
                 
A person's imagination, regardless of how boundless it may seem, is confined to the mind's ability to recombine the information it has already acquired from the body's sensory experience (the ideas that have been derived from impressions). In addition, “as our imagination takes our most basic ideas and leads us to form new ones, it is directed by three principles of association, namely, resemblance, contiguity, and cause and effect."&lt;ref&gt;Fieser, J. (2011, July 1). David Hume (1711-1776). In Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Retrieved March 8, 2017, from http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume/&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of resemblance refers to the tendency of ideas to become associated if the objects they represent resemble one another. For example, a person looking at an illustration of a flower can conceive of an idea of the physical flower because the idea of the illustrated object is associated with the idea of the physical object. The principle of contiguity describes the tendency of ideas to become associated if the objects they represent are near to each other in time or space, such as when the thought of one crayon in a box leads a person to think of the crayon contiguous to it. Finally, the principle of cause and effect refers to the tendency of ideas to become associated if the objects they represent are causally related, which explains how remembering a broken window can make someone think of the baseball that caused the window to shatter.
  
Hume elaborates more on this last principle of cause and effect. When a person observes that one object or event consistently produces the same object or event, it results in “an expectation that a particular event (a 'cause') will be followed by another event (an 'effect') previously and constantly associated with it."&lt;ref&gt;Norton, D. F. (1999). Hume, David. In R. Audi (Ed.), Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy (2nd ed., pp. 398-403). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.

(1990). An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. New York, NY: Anchor/Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even though custom can serve as a guide in life, it still only represents an expectation. In other words, “experience cannot establish a necessary connection between cause and effect, because we can imagine without contradiction a case where the cause does not produce its usual effect…the reason why we mistakenly infer that there is something in the cause that necessarily produces its effect is because our past experiences have habituated us to think in this way."&lt;ref&gt;Drefcinski, S. (n.d.). [http://people.uwplatt.edu/~drefcins/humeencyclopediaentry.html A Very Brief Summary of David Hume]. Retrieved March 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing this idea, Hume argues that "only in the pure realm of ideas, logic, and mathematics, not contingent on the direct sense awareness of reality, [can] causation safely…be applied – all other sciences are reduced to probability."&lt;ref&gt;An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. (2010). Masterplots, Fourth Edition, 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; He uses this skepticism to reject metaphysics and many theological views on the basis that they are not grounded in fact and observations, and are therefore beyond the reach of human understanding.

===Induction and causation&lt;!--linked from 'Problem of induction'--&gt;===
The cornerstone of Hume's epistemology is the [[problem of induction]]. This may be the area of Hume's thought where his scepticism about human powers of reason is most pronounced.{{sfn| Kenyon|Craig|1985|p= ?}} The problem revolves around the plausibility of [[inductive reasoning]], that is, reasoning from the observed behaviour of objects to their behaviour when unobserved. As Hume wrote, induction concerns how things behave when they go "beyond the present testimony of the senses, or the records of our memory".{{sfn|Hume|1777|p= 26}} Hume argues that we tend to believe that things behave in a regular manner, meaning that patterns in the behaviour of objects seem to persist into the future, and throughout the unobserved present.{{sfn|Atherton|1999|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=9u56iKhWQu4C&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=hume+Uniformity+of+Nature&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DVOIVKTQAon4UojxgJgL&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20Uniformity%20of%20Nature&amp;f=false pp. 202–203]}} Hume's argument is that we cannot rationally justify the claim that nature will continue to be uniform, as justification comes in only two varieties—demonstrative reasoning and probable reasoning{{refn|These are Hume's terms. In modern parlance, ''demonstration'' may be termed ''[[deductive reasoning]]'', while ''probability'' may be termed ''[[inductive reasoning]]''.{{sfn|Millican|1996|p= ?}}|group=note}}—and both of these are inadequate. With regard to demonstrative reasoning, Hume argues that the uniformity principle cannot be demonstrated, as it is "consistent and conceivable" that nature might stop being regular.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p= 111}} Turning to probable reasoning, Hume argues that we cannot hold that nature will continue to be uniform because it has been in the past. As this is using the very sort of reasoning (induction) that is under question, it would be [[circular reasoning]].{{sfn|Hume|1777|p= 115}} Thus, no form of justification will rationally warrant our inductive inferences.

Hume's solution to this problem is to argue that, rather than reason, natural instinct explains the human practice of making inductive inferences. He asserts that "Nature, by an absolute and uncontroulable necessity has determin'd us to judge as well as to breathe and feel." Agreeing, philosopher [[John D. Kenyon]] writes: "Reason might manage to raise a doubt about the truth of a conclusion of natural inductive inference just for a moment&amp;nbsp;... but the sheer agreeableness of animal faith will protect us from excessive caution and sterile suspension of belief."{{sfn|Kenyon|Craig|1985|p= 254}} Commentators such as [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] have demurred from Hume's solution,{{sfn|Harris|2004|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=uBbfizzKTDoC&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;pg=PA42&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 42]}} while, some, such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Karl Popper]], saw that Hume's analysis "had posed a most fundamental challenge to all human knowledge claims."{{sfn|Popkin|2014}}

The notion of [[Causality|causation]] is closely linked to the problem of induction. According to Hume, we reason inductively by associating constantly conjoined events. It is the mental act of association that is the basis of our concept of causation. There are at least three interpretations of Hume's theory of causation represented in the literature: (1) the logical positivist; (2) the sceptical realist; and (3) the quasi-realist.{{sfn|Read|Richman|2002|pp=13–14 and 69}}

Hume acknowledged that there are events constantly unfolding, humanity cannot guarantee that these events are caused by events prior or if they are independent instances. Hume opposed the widely accepted theory of Causation that 'all events have a specific course or reason.' Therefore, Hume crafted his own theory of causation, which he formed through his empiricist and skeptic beliefs. He split Causation, into two realms “All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, Relations of Ideas, and Matters of Fact”.&lt;ref&gt;. "Davidhume.org." Texts - An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding (1748, 1777). Web. 19 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Relations of Ideas are a priori, and represent universal bonds between ideas that mark the cornerstones of human thought. Matters of Fact are dependent on the observer and experience. They are often not universally held to be true among multiple persons. Hume was an Empiricist, meaning he believed “causes and effects are discoverable not by reason, but by experience”.&lt;ref&gt;."Davidhume.org." Texts - An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding (1748, 1777). Web. 19 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume later goes on to say that even with the perspective of the past, humanity cannot dictate future events because thoughts of the past are limited, compared to the possibilities for the future. Hume's separation between Matters of Fact and Relations of Ideas is often referred to as "[[Hume's fork]]".&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;William Edward Morris, [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/ "David Hume"], [[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (May 21, 2014), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume explains his theory of Causation and causal inference by division into three different parts. In these three branches he explains his ideas, in addition to comparing and contrasting his views to his predecessors. These branches are the Critical Phase, the Constructive Phase, and Belief.&lt;ref name="Davidhume 1748"&gt;"Davidhume.org." Texts - An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding (1748, 1777). Web. 19 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Critical Phase, Hume denies his predecessors' theories of causation. Next, Hume uses the Constructive Phase to resolve any doubts the reader may have while observing the Critical Phase. “Habit or Custom” mends the gaps in reasoning that occur without the human mind even realizing it. Associating ideas has become second nature to the human mind. It “makes us expect for the future, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in the past” &lt;ref name="Davidhume 1748"/&gt; However, Hume says that this association cannot be trusted because the span of the human mind to comprehend the past is not necessarily applicable to the wide and distant future. This leads Hume to the third branch of causal inference, Belief. Belief is what drives the human mind to hold that expectancy of the future based on past experience. Throughout his explanation of causal inference, Hume is arguing that the future is not certain to be repetition of the past and the only way to justify induction is through uniformity.

The [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] interpretation is that Hume analyses causal propositions, such as "A caused B", in terms of regularities in perception: "A causes B" is equivalent to "Whenever A-type events happen, B-type ones follow", where "whenever" refers to all possible perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;For this account of Hume's views on causation cf. {{harvtxt|Ayer|1946|pp=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Treatise of Human Nature'', Hume wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
power and necessity&amp;nbsp;... are&amp;nbsp;... qualities of perceptions, not of objects&amp;nbsp;... felt by the soul and not perceiv'd externally in bodies.{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=167}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This view is rejected by skeptical [[Philosophical realism|realists]], who argue that Hume thought that causation amounts to more than just the regular succession of events.&lt;ref name=CSW /&gt; Hume said that when two events are causally conjoined, a necessary connection underpins the conjunction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Shall we rest contented with these two relations of contiguity and succession, as affording a complete idea of causation? By no means&amp;nbsp;... there is a ''necessary connexion'' to be taken into consideration.{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=78|ps=, original emphasis}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Philosopher Angela Coventry writes that, for Hume, "there is nothing in any particular instance of cause and effect involving external objects which suggests the idea of power or necessary connection" and that "we are ignorant of the powers that operate between objects".{{sfn|Coventry|2006|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gq348MmuojAC&amp;dq=hume+coventry&amp;q=%22effect+involving%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22effect%20involving%22&amp;f=false pp. 91–92]}} However, while denying the possibility of knowing the powers between objects, Hume accepted the causal principle, writing, "I never asserted so absurd a proposition as that something could arise without a cause."{{sfn|Hume|2011|p=187}}

It has been argued that, while Hume did not think causation is reducible to pure regularity, he was not a fully fledged realist either. Philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]] calls this a [[quasi-realism|quasi-realist]] reading.{{sfn|Blackburn|1990|p= ?}} Blackburn writes that "Someone talking of cause is voicing a distinct mental set: he is by no means in the same state as someone merely describing regular sequences.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by {{harvtxt|Dauer|2010|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hume's words, "nothing is more usual than to apply to external bodies every internal sensation, which they occasion".{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=78, fn 17}}

===The self===
[[File:DavidHume.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Hume by [[Alexander Stoddart]] on the [[Royal Mile]] in Edinburgh]]
Empiricist philosophers, such as Hume and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], favoured the [[bundle theory]] of [[personal identity]].{{sfn|Dicker|2002|p=15}} In this theory, "the mind itself, far from being an independent power, is simply 'a bundle of perceptions' without unity or cohesive quality".{{sfn|Maurer|2013}} The self is nothing but a bundle of experiences linked by the relations of causation and resemblance; or, more accurately, that the empirically warranted idea of the self is just the idea of such a bundle. This view is forwarded by, for example, positivist interpreters, who saw Hume as suggesting that terms such as "self", "person", or "mind" referred to collections of "sense-contents".{{sfn|Ayer|1946|pp=135–136}} A modern-day version of the bundle theory of the mind has been advanced by [[Derek Parfit]] in his ''[[Reasons and Persons]]''.{{sfn|Parfit|1984|p= ?}}

However, some philosophers have criticised Hume's bundle-theory interpretation of personal identity. They argue that distinct selves can have perceptions that stand in relations of similarity and causality with one another. Thus, perceptions must already come parcelled into distinct "bundles" before they can be associated according to the relations of similarity and causality. In other words, the mind must already possess a unity that cannot be generated, or constituted, by these relations alone. Since the bundle-theory interpretation portrays Hume as answering an [[ontology|ontological]] question, philosophers, like [[Galen Strawson]], who see Hume as not very concerned with such questions have queried whether the view is really Hume's. Instead, it is suggested by Strawson that Hume might have been answering an epistemological question about the causal origin of our concept of the self.{{sfn|Strawson|2011|p= ?}} In the Appendix to the ''Treatise'', Hume declares himself dissatisfied with his earlier account of personal identity in Book 1. Philosopher Corliss Swain notes that "Commentators agree that if Hume did find some new problem" when he reviewed the section on personal identity, "he wasn't forthcoming about its nature in the Appendix."{{sfn|Swain|2008|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qoh7_nZbBjYC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=hume+blackwell+new+problem&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SmODVNGVG8G9UeJV&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20blackwell%20new%20problem&amp;f=false p. 142]}} One interpretation of Hume's view of the self has been argued for by philosopher and psychologist [[James Giles (philosopher)|James Giles]]. According to his view, Hume is not arguing for a bundle theory, which is a form of reductionism, but rather for an eliminative view of the self. That is, rather than reducing the self to a bundle of perceptions, Hume is rejecting the idea of the self altogether. On this interpretation, Hume is proposing a "[[Personal identity#The no-self theory|no-self theory]]" and thus has much in common with [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] thought.{{sfn|Giles|1993|p= ?}} On this point, psychologist [[Alison Gopnik]] has argued that Hume was in a position to learn about Buddhist thought during his time in France in the 1730s.{{sfn|Gopnik|2009|p= ?}}

===Practical reason===
An essential question of practical reason for Hume was whether or not standards or principles exist (and if they do, what they are) for practical reason, that are also authoritative for all rational beings, dictating people's intentions and actions. Hume is mainly considered an anti-rationalist, denying the possibility for practical reason as a principle to exist, although other philosophers such as [[Christine Korsgaard]], [[Jean Hampton]], and [[Elijah Millgram]] claim that Hume is not so much of an anti-rationalist as he is just a skeptic of practical reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=Michelle |authorlink= Michelle Mason |volume= 31 |issue= 2 |date=September 2005 |title=Hume and Humeans on Practical Reason |url=http://www.humesociety.org/hs/issues/v31n2/mason/mason-v31n2.pdf |publisher= [[Hume Studies]] |accessdate=2016-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume denied the existence of practical reason as a principle because he claimed reason does not have any effect on morality, since morality is capable of producing effects in people that reason alone cannot create. As Hume explains in ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' (1740): “Morals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason of itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hume |first=David|date=1740 |edition=1978|title=A Treatise of Human Nature |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon P |page=457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since practical reason is supposed to regulate our actions (in theory), Hume denied practical reason on the grounds that reason cannot directly oppose passions. As Hume puts it, “Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.” Reason is less significant than any passion because reason has no original influence, while "A passion is an original existence, or, if you will, modification of existence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hume |first=David|date=1740 |edition=1978 |title=A Treatise of Human Nature |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon P |page=415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical reason is also concerned with the value of actions rather than the truth of propositions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=practical-reason |title=Practical Reason |last=Wallace |first=Jay |date=2014 | work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; so Hume believed that reason's shortcoming of affecting morality proved that practical reason could not be authoritative for all rational beings, since morality was essential for dictating people's intentions and actions.

===Ethics===
{{see also|is–ought problem}}
Hume's writings on ethics began in the ''Treatise'' and were refined in his ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'' (1751). His views on ethics are that "[m]oral decisions are grounded in moral sentiment." It is not knowing that governs ethical actions, but feelings.{{sfn|Cranston|2014|p=4}} Arguing that reason cannot be behind morality, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Morals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=458}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hume's [[moral sentimentalism]] about morality was shared by his close friend Adam Smith,{{sfn|Hume|2013|p=548}}{{failed verification|date=March 2015}} and Hume and Smith were mutually influenced by the moral reflections of their older contemporary [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]].{{sfn|Taylor|1965|p= ?}} [[Peter Singer]] claims that Hume's argument that morals cannot have a rational basis alone "would have been enough to earn him a place in the history of ethics".{{sfn|Singer|2015}}

Hume also put forward the [[is–ought problem]], later called ''Hume's Law'',{{sfn|Singer|2015}} denying the possibility of logically deriving what ''ought'' to be from what ''is''. He wrote in the ''Treatise'' that in every system of morality he has read, the author begins with stating facts about the world, but then suddenly is always referring to what ought to be the case. Hume demands that a reason should be given for inferring what ought to be the case, from what is the case. This because it "seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others".{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=470}}

Hume's theory of ethics has been influential in modern-day [[Meta-ethics|meta-ethical theory]],{{sfn|Edwards|2002|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=0pGKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Hume++meta-ethics+influence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zrmIVL_FE4iBUc-JgIAG&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Hume%20%20meta-ethics%20influence&amp;f=false p. 44]}} helping to inspire [[emotivism]],{{sfn|Humber|2008|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dh-E6oIlCkAC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=Hume+emotivism+influence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9LuIVIfhIIW1UaCIg_AM&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hume%20emotivism%20influence&amp;f=false p. 136]}} and ethical [[expressivism]] and [[non-cognitivism]],{{sfn|Brown|2005|pp=97–100}}{{failed verification|date=March 2015}} as well as [[Allan Gibbard]]'s general theory of moral judgment and judgments of rationality.{{sfn|Angier|2012|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ndyMavMbiZMC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=Hume++influence+gibbard&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0r-IVKLZF4PwUJbrgLAJ&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Hume%20%20influence%20gibbard&amp;f=false p. 114]}}

===Aesthetics===
Hume's ideas about [[aesthetics]] and the [[theory of art]] are spread throughout his works, but are particularly connected with his ethical writings, and also the essays ''[[Of the Standard of Taste]]'' and ''[[Of Tragedy]]''. His views are rooted in the work of [[Joseph Addison]] and Francis Hutcheson.{{sfn|Gracyk|2011|loc= ch. 1}} In the ''Treatise'' he wrote of the connection between beauty and deformity and vice and virtue,{{sfn|Hume|1739|loc=Sect. VII and Sect VIII, pp. 295–304}} and his later writings on this subject continue to draw parallels of beauty and deformity in art, with conduct and character.{{sfn|Costelloe|2013|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=MH3_R04jW80C&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=hume+aesthetics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hvGFVMcPy_5So1I&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=deformity&amp;f=false p. viii]}}

In ''Of the Standard of Taste'', Hume argues that no rules can be drawn up about what is a tasteful object. However, a reliable critic of taste can be recognised as being objective, sensible and unprejudiced, and having extensive experience.{{sfn|Harris|2013|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=zWMBAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA401&amp;dq=hume+aesthetics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AxaGVPzBHcjsUsjwgOAP&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20aesthetics&amp;f=false p. 401]}} ''Of Tragedy'' addresses the question of why humans enjoy [[tragedy|tragic drama]]. Hume was concerned with the way spectators find pleasure in the sorrow and anxiety depicted in a tragedy. He argued that this was because the spectator is aware that he is witnessing a dramatic performance. There is pleasure in realising that the terrible events that are being shown are actually fiction.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSXlNY6xIMoC&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=hume+of+tragedy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RBqGVPnpBMb9Utelg9AP&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20of%20tragedy&amp;f=false pp. 325–326]}} Furthermore, Hume laid down rules for educating people in taste and correct conduct, and his writings in this area have been very influential on English and Anglo-Saxon aesthetics.{{sfn|Scruton|2014|p=18}}

===Free will, determinism, and responsibility===
Hume, along with Thomas Hobbes, is cited as a classical [[Compatibilism|compatibilist]] about the notions of [[free will|freedom]] and [[determinism]].{{sfn|McKenna|Coates|2015|loc=Ch. 3}} The thesis of compatibilism seeks to reconcile human freedom with the mechanist belief that human beings are part of a deterministic universe, whose happenings are governed by [[physical law]]s. Hume, to this end, was influenced greatly by the scientific revolution and by in particular Sir Isaac Newton.{{sfn|Wright|2010|p= ?}} Hume argued that the dispute about the compatibility of freedom and determinism has been continued over two thousand years by ambiguous terminology. He wrote: "From this circumstance alone, that a controversy has been long kept on foot&amp;nbsp;... we may presume that there is some ambiguity in the expression", and that different disputants use different meanings for the same terms.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=81}}{{sfn|Passmore|2013||loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vZRtAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=hume+presume+that+there+is+some+ambiguity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3zSMVOvlJYnyULWZhPgP&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20presume%20that%20there%20is%20some%20ambiguity&amp;f=false p. 73]}}

Hume defines the concept of necessity as "the uniformity, observable in the operations of nature; where similar objects are constantly conjoined together",{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=82}} and [[liberty]] as "a power of acting or not acting, according to the determinations of the will".{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=95}} He then argues that, according to these definitions, not only are the two compatible, but liberty ''requires'' necessity. For if our actions were not necessitated in the above sense, they would "have so little in connexion with motives, inclinations and circumstances, that one does not follow with a certain degree of uniformity from the other". But if our actions are not thus connected to the will, then our actions can never be free: they would be matters of "chance; which is universally allowed to have no existence".{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=96}} Australian philosopher [[John Passmore]] writes that confusion has arisen because "necessity" has been taken to mean "necessary connexion". Once this has been abandoned, Hume argues that "liberty and necessity will be found not to be in conflict one with another".{{sfn|Passmore|2013||loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vZRtAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=hume+presume+that+there+is+some+ambiguity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3zSMVOvlJYnyULWZhPgP&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20presume%20that%20there%20is%20some%20ambiguity&amp;f=false p. 73]}}

Moreover, Hume goes on to argue that in order to be held [[morally responsible]], it is required that our behaviour be caused or necessitated, for, as he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Actions are, by their very nature, temporary and perishing; and where they proceed not from some ''cause'' in the character and disposition of the person who performed them, they can neither redound to his honour, if good; nor infamy, if evil.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=98|ps=, original emphasis}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hume describes the link between causality and our capacity to rationally make a decision from this an inference of the mind. Human beings assess a situation based upon certain predetermined events and from that form a choice. Hume believes that this choice is made spontaneously. Hume calls this form of decision making the liberty of spontaneity.{{sfn|Mounce|Mounce|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qyepEVWo0v8C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=hume+liberty+of+spontaneity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bjeMVOKlG4L6UJe1gNgL&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20liberty%20of%20spontaneity&amp;f=false p. 66]}}

Education writer Richard Wright considers that Hume's position rejects a famous moral puzzle attributed to French philosopher [[Jean Buridan]]. The [[Buridan's ass]] puzzle describes a donkey that is hungry. This donkey has on both sides of him separate bales of hay, which are of equal distances from him. The problem concerns which bale the donkey chooses. Buridan was said to believe that the donkey would die, because he has no [[autonomy]]. The donkey is incapable of forming a rational decision as there is no motive to choose one bale of hay over the other. However, human beings are different, because a human who is placed in a position where he is forced to choose one loaf of bread over another will make a decision to take one in lieu of the other. For Buridan, humans have the capacity of autonomy, and he recognises the choice that is ultimately made will be based on chance, as both loaves of bread are exactly the same. However, Wright says that Hume completely rejects this notion, arguing that a human will spontaneously act in such a situation because he is faced with impending death if he fails to do so. Such a decision is not made on the basis of chance, but rather on necessity and spontaneity, given the prior predetermined events leading up to the predicament.{{sfn|Wright|2010|p= ?}}

Hume's argument is supported by modern-day compatibilists such as [[R. E. Hobart]], a pseudonym of philosopher Dickinson S. Miller.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{harvtxt|Hobart|1934|p=?}} and {{harvtxt|Carroll|Markosian|2010|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=f6bcZq4_4gUC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=hume+hobart+Free+Will+as+Involving&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vjiMVJalEcjzUIu6gdgL&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20hobart%20Free%20Will%20as%20Involving&amp;f=false p. 54, note 11]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[P. F. Strawson]] argued that the issue of whether we hold one another morally responsible does not ultimately depend on the truth or falsity of a metaphysical thesis such as determinism. This is because our so holding one another is a non-rational human sentiment that is not predicated on such theses.{{sfn|Strawson|2008|p=?}}{{sfn|Prasad|1995|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=66b8FJmZQ38C&amp;dq=hume+strawson&amp;q=hume+moral%2C+reactive#v=snippet&amp;q=hume%20moral%2C%20reactive&amp;f=false p. 348]}}

===Writings on religion===
The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' states that Hume "wrote forcefully and incisively on almost every central question in the philosophy of religion." His "various writings concerning problems of religion are among the most important and influential contributions on this topic."{{sfn|Russell|2014|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/ Hume on Religion]}} His writings in this field cover the philosophy, psychology, history, and anthropology of religious thought. All of these aspects were discussed in Hume's 1757 dissertation, ''The Natural History of Religion''. Here he argued that the [[monotheistic]] religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam all derive from earlier [[polytheistic]] religions. He also suggested that all religious belief "traces, in the end, to dread of the unknown."{{sfn|O'Connor|2013|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ntygPAezQJUC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=hume+religion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1s_GU_r3KPPH7Abi94GgAg&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20religion&amp;f=false pp. 7–8]}} Hume had also written on religious subjects in the first ''Enquiry'', as well as later in the ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion''.{{sfn|Russell|2014|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/ Ch. 1]}}

Although he wrote a great deal about religion, Hume's personal views are unclear, and there has been much discussion concerning his religious position.&lt;ref&gt;E.g in {{harvtxt|Russell|2010}}, {{harvtxt|O'Connor|2013}}, and {{harvtxt|Norton|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporaries considered him to be an atheist, or at least un-Christian, and the [[Church of Scotland]] seriously considered bringing charges of infidelity against him.{{sfn|Mossner|1980|p=206}} The fact that contemporaries thought that he may have been an atheist is exemplified by a story Hume liked to tell:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The best theologian he ever met, he used to say, was the old Edinburgh fishwife who, having recognized him as Hume the atheist, refused to pull him out of the bog into which he had fallen until he declared he was a Christian and repeated the Lord's prayer.{{sfn|Scharfstein|1998|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=iZQy2lu70bwC&amp;pg=PA454&amp;dq=hume++fishwives&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wi3KU6jOGMaM7AaRoIDYBQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20%20fishwives&amp;f=false p. 454, footnote]}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in works such as ''Of Superstition and Enthusiasm'', Hume specifically seems to support the standard religious views of his time and place. This still meant that he could be very critical of the [[Catholic Church]], dismissing it with the standard [[Protestant]] accusations of superstition and idolatry,{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=51}}{{sfn|Hume|1741|p=70}} as well as dismissing as idolatry what his compatriots saw as uncivilised beliefs.{{sfn|Hume|1757|p=34}} He also considered extreme Protestant sects, the members of which he called "enthusiasts", to be corrupters of religion.{{sfn|Hume|1741|pp=73–76}} By contrast, in his ''[[The Natural History of Religion]]'', Hume presented arguments suggesting that [[polytheism]] had much to commend it over [[monotheism]].{{sfn|Hume|1757|p=63}}

Philosopher [[Paul Russell (philosopher)|Paul Russell]] writes that it is likely that Hume was sceptical about religious belief, but not to the extent of complete atheism.  He suggests that perhaps Hume's position is best characterised by the term "irreligion",{{sfn|Russell|2010|pp=202, 204–205, and 284}} while philosopher David O'Connor argues that Hume's final position was "weakly [[deistic]]". For O'Connor, Hume's "position is deeply ironic. This is because, while inclining towards a weak form of [[deism]], he seriously doubts that we can ever find a sufficiently favourable balance of evidence to justify accepting any religious position." He adds that Hume "did not believe in the God of standard theism&amp;nbsp;... but he did not rule out all concepts of deity", and that "ambiguity suited his purposes, and this creates difficulty in definitively pinning down his final position on religion".{{sfn|O'Connor|2013|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ntygPAezQJUC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=%22but+he+did+not+rule+out+all+concepts+of+deity%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ulLs4-GWED&amp;sig=XcJNdJXP3jP-N0ynFZ8wroDbAUg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CtwmVd-BKueP7AbA14CYDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22but%20he%20did%20not%20rule%20out%20all%20concepts%20of%20deity%22&amp;f=false pp.11, 19]}}

====Design argument====
One of the traditional topics of [[natural theology]] is that of the [[existence of God]], and one of the ''[[a posteriori]]'' arguments for this is the ''argument from design'' or the [[teleological argument]]. The argument is that the existence of God can be proved by the design that is obvious in the complexity of the world. ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' states that this is "the most popular, because [it is] the most accessible of the theistic arguments&amp;nbsp;... which identifies evidences of design in nature, inferring from them a divine designer&amp;nbsp;... The fact that the universe as a whole is a coherent and efficiently functioning system likewise, in this view, indicates a divine intelligence behind it."&lt;ref name = RE&gt;[[#{{harvid|RE}}|RE]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=April 2015}}

In ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Hume wrote that the design argument seems to depend upon our experience, and its proponents "always suppose the universe, an effect quite singular and unparalleled, to be the proof of a Deity, a cause no less singular and unparalleled".{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=148}} Philosopher Louise E. Loeb notes that Hume is saying that only experience and observation can be our guide to making inferences about the conjunction between events. However, according to Hume, "we observe neither God nor other universes, and hence no conjunction involving them. There is no observed conjunction to ground an inference either to extended objects or to God, as unobserved causes."{{sfn|Loeb|2010|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6ECxW_2tAf0C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=companion+hume+observe+neither+God+nor+other+universes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z0OMVMfjJob1UvykgLAN&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=companion%20hume%20observe%20neither%20God%20nor%20other%20universes&amp;f=false p. 118]}}

Hume also criticised the argument in his ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion'' (1779). In this, he suggested that, even if the world is a more or less smoothly functioning system, this may only be a result of the "chance permutations of particles falling into a temporary or permanent self-sustaining order, which thus has the appearance of design."&lt;ref name=RE /&gt;

A century later, the idea of order without design was rendered more plausible by Charles Darwin's discovery that the adaptations of the forms of life are a result of the [[natural selection]] of inherited characteristics.&lt;ref name=RE /&gt; For philosopher James D. Madden, it is "Hume, rivaled only by Darwin, [who] has done the most to undermine in principle our confidence in arguments from design among all figures in the Western intellectual tradition."{{sfn|Madden|2005|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=UKSZeRnuyjAC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=teleological+god+hume+darwin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FvrIU4uBMYOu7AaV1oGQCw&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=teleological%20god%20hume%20darwin&amp;f=false p. 150, emphasis removed.]}}

Finally, Hume discussed a version of the [[anthropic principle]], which is the idea that theories of the universe are constrained by the need to allow for man's existence in it as an observer. Hume has his sceptical mouthpiece Philo suggest that there may have been many worlds, produced by an incompetent designer, whom he called a "stupid mechanic". In his ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion'', Hume wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many worlds might have been botched and bungled throughout an eternity, ere this system was struck out: much labour lost: many fruitless trials made: and a slow, but continued improvement carried on during infinite ages in the art of world-making.{{sfn|Hume|1779|p=167}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

American philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] has suggested that this mechanical explanation of teleology, although "obviously&amp;nbsp;... an amusing philosophical fantasy", anticipated the notion of natural selection, the 'continued improvement' being like "any Darwinian selection algorithm."{{sfn|Dennett|2009|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=i1tNI9646Q4C&amp;pg=PA620&amp;dq=hume++anthropic+principle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4zXKU_nGCqaw7Aa-w4GAAg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20%20anthropic%20principle&amp;f=false pp. 620–621]}}

====Problem of miracles====
{{main|Of Miracles}}

In his discussion of [[miracle]]s, Hume argues that we should not believe that miracles have occurred and that they do not therefore provide us with any reason to think that God exists.{{sfn|Bailey|O'Brien|2006|p=101}} In ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'' (Section 10), Hume defines a miracle as "a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent". Hume says that we believe an event that has frequently occurred is likely to occur again, but we also take into account those instances where the event did not occur. Hume wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A wise man [...] considers which side is supported by the greater number of experiments [...] A hundred instances or experiments on one side, and fifty on another, afford a doubtful expectation of any event; though a hundred uniform experiments, with only one that is contradictory, reasonably beget a pretty strong degree of assurance. In all cases, we must balance the opposite experiments [...] and deduct the smaller number from the greater, in order to know the exact force of the superior evidence.{{sfn|Hume|1777|pp=110–111}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hume discusses the testimony of those who report miracles. He wrote that testimony might be doubted even from some great authority in case the facts themselves are not credible. "[T]he evidence, resulting from the testimony, admits of a diminution, greater or less, in proportion as the fact is more or less unusual."{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=113}}

Although Hume leaves open the possibility for miracles to occur and be reported, he offers various arguments against this ever having happened in history:{{sfn|Hume|1777|pp=116–131|ps=, Part II of Section X}} He points out that people often lie, and they have good reasons to lie about miracles occurring either because they believe they are doing so for the benefit of their religion or because of the fame that results. Furthermore, people by nature enjoy relating miracles they have heard without caring for their veracity and thus miracles are easily transmitted even where false. Also, Hume notes that miracles seem to occur mostly in "ignorant and barbarous nations"{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=119}} and times, and the reason they do not occur in the civilised societies is such societies are not awed by what they know to be natural events. Finally, the miracles of each religion argue against all other religions and their miracles, and so even if a proportion of all reported miracles across the world fit Hume's requirement for belief, the miracles of each religion make the other less likely.{{sfn|Bailey|O'Brien|2006|pp=105–108}}

Hume was extremely pleased with his argument against miracles in his ''Enquiry''. He states "I flatter myself, that I have discovered an argument of a like nature, which, if just, will, with the wise and learned, be an everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion, and consequently, will be useful as long as the world endures."{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=110}} Thus, Hume's argument against miracles had a more abstract basis founded upon the scrutiny, not just primarily of miracles, but of all forms of belief systems. It is a common sense notion of veracity based upon epistemological evidence, and founded on a principle of rationality, proportionality and reasonability.{{sfn|Bailey|O'Brien|2006|pp=105–108}}

The criterion for assessing a belief system for Hume is based on the balance of probability whether something is more likely than not to have occurred. Since the weight of empirical experience contradicts the notion for the existence of miracles, such accounts should be treated with scepticism. Further, the myriad of accounts of miracles contradict one another, as some people who receive miracles will aim to prove the authority of Jesus, whereas others will aim to prove the authority of Muhammad or some other religious prophet or deity. These various differing accounts weaken the overall evidential power of miracles.{{sfn| Ahluwalia|2008|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-PCV11VQ8PYC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=%22Understanding+Philosophy+of+Religion%22+hume&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6qs4Vbe4EofXPeywgbgN&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Understanding%20Philosophy%20of%20Religion%22%20hume&amp;f=false pp.104–106]}}{{failed verification|date=April 2015}}

Despite all this, Hume observes that belief in miracles is popular, and that "The gazing populace [...] receive greedily, without examination, whatever soothes superstition, and promotes wonder."{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=126}}

Critics have argued that Hume's position assumes the character of miracles and [[natural law]]s prior to any specific examination of miracle claims, thus it amounts to a subtle form of [[begging the question]]. To assume that testimony is a homogeneous reference group seems unwise- to compare private miracles with public miracles, unintellectual observers with intellectual observers and those who have little to gain and much to lose with those with much to gain and little to lose is not convincing to many. Indeed, many have argued that miracles not only do not contradict the laws of nature, but require the laws of nature to be intelligible as miraculous, and thus subverting the law of nature. For example, William Adams remarks that "there must be an ordinary course of nature before anything can be extraordinary. There must be a stream before anything can be interrupted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/essayinanswertom00adamiala#page/14/mode/2up |title=An essay in answer to Mr. Hume's Essay on miracles |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also noted that it requires an appeal to inductive inference, as none have observed every part of nature nor examined every possible miracle claim, for instance those in the future. This, in Hume's philosophy, was especially problematic.{{sfn|Levine|1989|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fC3-d89f7qoC&amp;dq=hume+miracle+criticism&amp;q=%22hume+with+a+glaring%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22hume%20with%20a%20glaring%22&amp;f=false p. 3]}}

Of Campbell, it is rumoured that, having read Campbell's Dissertation, Hume remarked that "the Scotch theologue had beaten him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=George Campbell |url=http://historicalapologetics.org/campbell-george/ |title=Campbell, George « Library of Historical Apologetics |publisher=Historicalapologetics.org |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's main argument concerning miracles is that miracles by definition are singular events that differ from the established laws of nature. Such natural laws are codified as a result of past experiences. Therefore, a miracle is a violation of all prior experience and thus incapable on this basis of reasonable belief. However, the probability that something has occurred in contradiction of all past experience should always be judged to be less than the probability that either ones senses have deceived one, or the person recounting the miraculous occurrence is lying or mistaken. Hume would say, all of which he had past experience of. For Hume, this refusal to grant credence does not guarantee correctness. He offers the example of an Indian Prince, who, having grown up in a hot country, refuses to believe that water has frozen. By Hume's lights, this refusal is not wrong and the Prince "reasoned justly"; it is presumably only when he has had extensive experience of the freezing of water that he has warrant to believe that the event could occur.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=113}}

So for Hume, either the miraculous event will become a recurrent event or else it will never be rational to believe it occurred. The connection to religious belief is left unexplained throughout, except for the close of his discussion where Hume notes the reliance of Christianity upon testimony of miraculous occurrences. He makes an ironic remark that anyone who "is moved by faith to assent" to revealed testimony "is conscious of a continued miracle in his own person, which subverts all principles of his understanding, and gives him a determination to believe what is most contrary to custom and experience."{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=131|ps=, emphasis removed}}{{sfn|MacKie|1982|p=29}} Hume writes that "All the testimony which ever was really given for any miracle, or ever will be given, is a subject of derision."{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=113}}

===As historian of England===
[[File:David Hume 2.jpg|thumb| David Hume by [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]], 1766]]
From 1754 to 1762 Hume published ''The History of England'', a 6-volume work, which extends, says its subtitle, "From the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1688". Inspired by [[Voltaire]]'s sense of the breadth of history, Hume widened the focus of the field away from merely kings, parliaments, and armies, to literature and science as well. He argued that the quest for liberty was the highest standard for judging the past, and concluded that after considerable fluctuation, England at the time of his writing had achieved "the most entire system of liberty that was ever known amongst mankind".&lt;ref&gt;Hume's History of England, vol, 6, p. 531 cited in {{harvtxt|Kenyon|1984|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; It "must be regarded as an event of cultural importance. In its own day, moreover, it was an innovation, soaring high above its very few predecessors."{{sfn|Jessop|2015}}

Hume's coverage of the political upheavals of the 17th century relied in large part on the [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon]]'s ''History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England'' (1646–69). Generally, Hume took a moderate [[royalist]] position and considered revolution unnecessary to achieve necessary reform. Hume was considered a Tory historian, and emphasised religious differences more than constitutional issues. Laird Okie explains that "Hume preached the virtues of political moderation, but&amp;nbsp;... it was moderation with an anti-Whig, pro-royalist coloring."{{sfn|Okie|1985|p=16}} For "Hume shared the&amp;nbsp;... Tory belief that the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]] were no more high-handed than their Tudor predecessors".{{sfn|Okie|1985|p=25}} "Even though Hume wrote with an anti-Whig animus, it is, paradoxically, correct to regard the ''History'' as an establishment work, one which implicitly endorsed the ruling oligarchy".{{sfn|Okie|1985|p=27}}
Historians have debated whether Hume posited a universal unchanging human nature, or allowed for evolution and development.{{sfn|Wertz|1975|p=?}}

Robert Roth argues that Hume's histories display his biases against [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]s and [[Puritan]]s. Roth says his anti-Whig pro-monarchy position diminished the influence of his work, and that his emphasis on politics and religion led to a neglect of social and economic history.{{sfn|Roth|1991|p=?}}

Hume was an early cultural [[history of science|historian of science]]. His short biographies of leading scientists explored the process of scientific change. He developed new ways of seeing scientists in the context of their times by looking at how they interacted with society and each other. He covers over forty scientists, with special attention paid to [[Francis Bacon]], [[Robert Boyle]], and [[Isaac Newton]]. Hume particularly praised [[William Harvey]], writing about his treatise of the circulation of the blood: "Harvey is entitled to the glory of having made, by reasoning alone, without any mixture of accident, a capital discovery in one of the most important branches of science".{{sfn|Wertz|1993|p=?}}

The ''History'' became a best-seller and made Hume a wealthy man who no longer had to take up salaried work for others.{{sfn|Morris|Brown|2011|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/hume/#LifWor Chapter Life and Works]}} It was influential for nearly a century, despite competition from imitations by [[Tobias Smollett|Smollett]] (1757), [[Oliver Goldsmith|Goldsmith]] (1771) and others. By 1894, there were at least 50 editions as well as abridgements for students, and illustrated pocket editions, probably produced specifically for women.{{sfn|Phillipson|2012|p=131}}

===Political theory===
{{Utilitarianism}}
It is difficult to categorise Hume's political affiliations. His writings contain elements that are, in modern terms, both conservative and liberal,{{sfn|Dees|2010|p=403}} although these terms are anachronistic. [[Thomas Jefferson]] banned the ''History'' from [[University of Virginia]], feeling that it had "spread universal toryism over the land".&lt;ref&gt;so quoted in {{harvtxt|Livingston|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, [[Samuel Johnson]] thought Hume "a Tory by chance&amp;nbsp;... for he has no principle. If he is anything, he is a Hobbist", a follower of [[Thomas Hobbes]].{{sfn|Hume|1888|loc=note 13 to letter LXXXIV}} A major concern of Hume's political philosophy is the importance of the rule of law. He also stresses throughout his political essays the importance of moderation in politics: public spirit and regard to the community.{{sfn|Forbes|1985|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PX86AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=politics+moderation+hume&amp;q=politics+moderation+hume+detested#v=snippet&amp;q=politics%20moderation%20hume%20detested&amp;f=false p. 150]}}

This outlook needs to be seen within the historical context of 18th-century Scotland. Here, the legacy of religious civil war, combined with the relatively recent memory of the 1715 and 1745 Jacobite risings, fostered in a historian such as Hume a distaste for enthusiasm and factionalism. These appeared to threaten the fragile and nascent political and social stability of a country that was deeply politically and religiously divided.{{sfn|Wiley|2012|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q94tuawjdYUC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=hume+enthusiasm&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r6vjU73yDKbD7AaP54GYAQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20enthusiasm&amp;f=false p. 211]}}{{failed verification|date=August 2015}} Hume thought that society is best governed by a general and impartial system of laws; he is less concerned about the form of government that administers these laws, so long as it does so fairly. However, he does write that a republic must produce laws, while "monarchy, when absolute, contains even something repugnant to law."{{sfn|Hume|1741|p=119}}

Hume expressed suspicion of attempts to reform society in ways that departed from long-established custom, and he counselled peoples not to resist their governments except in cases of the most egregious tyranny.{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=550}} However, he resisted aligning himself with either of Britain's two political parties, the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] and the [[Tory|Tories]]. Hume wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;My views of ''things'' are more conformable to Whig principles; my representations of ''persons'' to Tory prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;so quoted in {{harvtxt|Mossner|1980|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7HXJAqqNl4QC&amp;q=whig#v=snippet&amp;q=whig&amp;f=false p. 311]}}, original emphasis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Canadian philosopher Neil McArthur writes that Hume believed that we should try to balance our demands for liberty with the need for strong authority, without sacrificing either. McArthur characterises Hume as a "precautionary conservative",{{sfn|McArthur|2007|p=124}} whose actions would have been "determined by prudential concerns about the consequences of change, which often demand we ignore our own principles about what is ideal or even legitimate."{{sfn|McArthur|2007}}{{failed verification|date=October 2015}} Hume supported the [[freedom of the press|liberty of the press]], and was sympathetic to democracy, when suitably constrained. American historian [[Douglass Adair]] has argued that Hume was a major inspiration for [[James Madison]]'s writings, and the essay "[[Federalist No. 10]]" in particular.{{sfn|Adair|1957|p=?}}

Hume offered his view on the best type of society in an essay titled "Idea of a Perfect Commonwealth", which lays out what he thought was the best form of government. He hoped that, "in some future age, an opportunity might be afforded of reducing the theory to practice, either by a dissolution of some old government, or by the combination of men to form a new one, in some distant part of the world". He defended a strict [[separation of powers]], [[decentralization|decentralisation]], extending the [[Suffrage|franchise]] to anyone who held property of value and limiting the power of the clergy. The system of the [[military of Switzerland|Swiss militia]] was proposed as the best form of protection. Elections were to take place on an annual basis and representatives were to be unpaid.{{sfn|Hume|1987}} Political philosophers [[Leo Strauss]] and [[Joseph Cropsey]], writing of Hume's thoughts about "the wise statesman", note that he "will bear a reverence to what carries the marks of age". Also, if he wishes to improve a constitution, his innovations will take account of the "ancient fabric", in order not to disturb society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7mScxst9UoC&amp;dq=History+of+Political+Philosophy&amp;q=%22limits+of+human+foresight%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22limits%20of%20human%20foresight%22&amp;f=false |title=Strauss, L. and Cropsey, J., '&amp;#39;History of Political Philosophy'&amp;#39;, University of Chicago Press, 2012, p. 556 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2012-06-15 |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the political analysis of philosopher [[George Holland Sabine|George Sabine]], the scepticism of Hume extended to the doctrine of [[consent of the governed|government by consent]]. He notes that "allegiance is a habit enforced by education and consequently as much a part of human nature as any other motive."&lt;ref&gt;[[George Sabine|Sabine, GH.]], ''A History of Political Theory'', Dryden Press, 1973 (1937), p. 603.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1770s, Hume was critical of British policies toward the American colonies and advocated for American independence.  He wrote in 1771 that "our union with America... in the nature of things, cannot long subsist".&lt;ref name=wsj11042017 /&gt;

===Contributions to economic thought===
[[File:David_Hume_and_Adam_Smith_statues,_Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|Statues of David Hume and [[Adam Smith]] by David Watson Stevenson on the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] in Edinburgh]]
Hume noted his views as economist in his ''Political Discourses'', which were incorporated in ''Essays and Treatises'' as Part II of ''Essays, Moral and Political''.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/David-Hume#toc12268|title=David Hume {{!}} Scottish philosopher|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; To what extent he was influenced by Adam Smith is difficult to stress, however both of them had similar principles supported from historical events.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"/&gt;  At the same time Hume did not demonstrate concrete system of economic theory which could be observed in Smith's [[The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]]. However, he introduced several new ideas  around which the “classical economics” of the 18th century was built.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"/&gt; Through his discussions on politics, Hume developed many ideas that are prevalent in the field of economics. This includes ideas on [[private property]], inflation, and [[international trade|foreign trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Lionel ''A History of Economic Thought: The LSE Lectures'' edited by Medema and Samuels. Ch 11 and 12&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to his essay "[[Of the Balance of Trade]]", economist [[Paul Krugman]] has remarked that "David Hume created what I consider the first true economic model."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=How We Know The Earth Is Old|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com//2012/11/20/how-we-know-the-earth-is-old/|work=The New York Times|accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Locke, Hume believes that private property is not a natural right. Hume argues it is justified, because resources are limited. Private property would be an unjustified, "idle ceremonial", if all goods were unlimited and available freely.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, H. [https://books.google.com/books?id=9Kw5vLbYq-4C&amp;pg=PA322&amp;dq=hume+idle+ceremonial&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=plOMVOCrMozuaMjCgqgD&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20idle%20ceremonial&amp;f=false ''Understanding the Global Economy''], Peace Education Books, 2004, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume also believed in an unequal distribution of property, because perfect equality would destroy the ideas of thrift and industry. Perfect equality would thus lead to impoverishment.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David ''An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals'' (1751)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, JB., [https://books.google.com/books?id=MTYABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=hume+private+property&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hlKMVLXeHtfwaLf1gagD&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20private%20property&amp;f=false ''Opinion and Reform in Hume's Political Philosophy''], Princeton University Press, 2014, pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

Due to Hume's vast influence on contemporary philosophy, a large number of approaches in contemporary philosophy and cognitive science are today called "Humean."&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, Don, ''Hume (The Routledge Philosophers)'', Routledge -Reprint edition, 2014, p. ? {{ISBN|978-0415283342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attention to Hume's philosophical works grew after the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]], in his ''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]]'' (1783), credited Hume with awakening him from his "dogmatic slumber".&lt;ref&gt;Kant, I., ''Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics'': 'Introduction'&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], "there is more to be learned from each page of David Hume than from the collected philosophical works of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]] and [[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]] taken together."&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=OHIJgObqoXoC&amp;dq=Schopenhauer+World+as+Will+and+Representation+volume+2+hume&amp;q=page+hume+together#v=snippet&amp;q=page%20hume%20together&amp;f=false ''The World as Will and Representation''], Vol. 2, Ch. 46, p. 582.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. J. Ayer]], while introducing his classic exposition of logical positivism in 1936, claimed: "The views which are put forward in this treatise derive from&amp;nbsp;... doctrines&amp;nbsp;... which are themselves the logical outcome of the empiricism of Berkeley and David Hume."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3M3ycPeuRNoC&amp;dq=ayer+truth&amp;q=%22The+views%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22The%20views%22&amp;f=false Ayer, AJ., ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'', London, Preface to First Edition.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Einstein]], in 1915, wrote that he was inspired by Hume's positivism when formulating his theory of [[special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, A., in a letter of 14 December 1915, to Moritz Schlick (Papers, A, Vol. 8A, Doc.165)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's problem of induction was also of fundamental importance to the philosophy of Karl Popper. In his autobiography, ''Unended Quest'', he wrote: "Knowledge&amp;nbsp;... is ''objective''; and it is hypothetical or conjectural. This way of looking at the problem made it possible for me to reformulate Hume's ''problem of induction''". This insight resulted in Popper's major work ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K., [https://books.google.com/books?id=YmoQBAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Hume+Unended+Quest&amp;q=%22is+hypothetical+or+conjectural%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22is%20hypothetical%20or%20conjectural%22&amp;f=false ''Unended Quest; An Intellectual Autobiography''], 1976, pp. 95–96, {{ISBN|0-415-28590-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in his ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'', he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I approached the problem of induction through Hume. Hume, I felt, was perfectly right in pointing out that induction cannot be logically justified.&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K., [https://books.google.com/books?id=zXh9AwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=popper+conjectures&amp;q=%22approached+the+problem%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22approached%20the%20problem%22&amp;f=false ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge''], Routledge, 2014, . 55.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The writings of Scottish philosopher and contemporary of Hume, [[Thomas Reid]], were often criticisms of Hume's scepticism. Reid formulated his [[common sense]] philosophy in part as a reaction against Hume's views.&lt;ref&gt;''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reid/#ComSenFirPri "Thomas Reid"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume influenced and was influenced by the Christian philosopher [[Joseph Butler]]. Hume was impressed by Butler's way of thinking about religion, and Butler may well have been influenced by Hume's writings.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, R., [https://books.google.com/books?id=8zTVtbQQuKsC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=butler+hume&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wkWLVNOLN4T6ULC9hPgJ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=butler%20hume&amp;f=false ''Philosophy and Religion in Enlightenment Britain: New Case Studies''], Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= plat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/hume-religion/ |title=Hume on Religion |author=Paul Russel |date=17 May 2010 |work=First published October 4, 2005 |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2008 Edition) |accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's [[rationalism]] in religious subjects influenced, via German-Scottish theologian [[Johann Joachim Spalding]], the German [[neology]] school and [[rational theology]], and contributed to the transformation of German theology in the [[age of enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Schröter: Transformationen des Theologiebegriffes in der Aufklärung.

Danish theologian and philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] adopted "Hume's suggestion that the role of reason is not to make us wise but to reveal our ignorance." However, Kierkegaard took this as a reason for the necessity of religious faith, or [[fideism]]. The "fact that Christianity is contrary to reason ... is the necessary precondition for true faith." Political theorist [[Isaiah Berlin]], for example, has pointed out the similarities between the arguments of Hume and Kierkegaard against [[rational theology]].&lt;ref name=kirk&gt;Miles, T.

According to philosopher [[Jerry Fodor]], Hume's ''Treatise'' is "the founding document of [[cognitive science]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographyonline.net/writers/philosophers/david-hume.html|title=David Hume Biography|work=Biography Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume engaged with contemporary intellectual luminaries such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[James Boswell]], and [[Adam Smith]] (who acknowledged Hume's influence on his economics and [[political philosophy]]).

[[Isaiah Berlin]] once said of Hume that "No man has influenced the history of philosophy to a deeper or more disturbing degree."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://philosophynow.org/podcasts/Impressions_of_David_Hume|title=Impressions of David Hume - Podcasts - Philosophy Now|work=philosophynow.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' writes that Hume is "[g]enerally regarded as one of the most important philosophers to write in English."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/|title=David Hume|work=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
His nephew and namesake, [[David Hume (advocate)|David Hume of Ninewells]] (1757–1838), was a co-founder of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1783. He was a Professor of Scots Law at [[Edinburgh University]] and rose to be Principal Clerk Of Session in the Scottish High court and Baron of the Exchequer. He is buried with his uncle in Old Calton Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
* ''A Kind of History of My Life'' (1734) Mss 23159 [[National Library of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;David Fate Norton (ed.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Hume'', Cambridge University Press, 1993, pp. 345–350.&lt;/ref&gt; A letter to an unnamed physician, asking for advice about "the Disease of the Learned" that then afflicted him. Here he reports that at the age of eighteen "there seem'd to be open'd up to me a new Scene of Thought" that made him "throw up every other Pleasure or Business" and turned him to scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Hume''. pp. 346.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]: Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects'' (1739–40). Hume intended to see whether the [https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/hume/david/h92t/ ''Treatise of Human Nature''] met with success, and if so to complete it with books devoted to Politics and Criticism. However, it did not meet with success. As Hume himself said, "It fell ''dead-born from the press'', without reaching such distinction as even to excite a murmur among the zealots"{{sfn|Hume|1993|p=352}} and so was not completed.
* ''An Abstract of a Book lately Published: Entitled A Treatise of Human Nature etc''. (1740) Anonymously published, but almost certainly written by Hume&lt;ref&gt;For this see the introduction by J. M. Keynes and P. Sraffa in: Hume, David (1965). ''An Abstract of A Treatise of Human Nature 1740. Connecticut: Archon Books&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to popularise his ''Treatise''. Of considerable philosophical interest, because it spells out what he considered "The Chief Argument" of the ''Treatise'', in a way that seems to anticipate the structure of the ''Enquiry concerning Human Understanding''.
* ''[[Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary]]'' (first ed. 1741–2) A collection of pieces written and published over many years, though most were collected together in 1753–4. Many of the essays are focused on topics in politics and economics, though they also range over questions of [[aesthetics|aesthetic judgement]], love, marriage and polygamy, and the demographics of ancient Greece and Rome, to name just a few of the topics considered. The Essays show some influence from [[Joseph Addison|Addison]]'s ''Tatler'' and ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', which Hume read avidly in his youth.
* ''A Letter from a Gentleman to His Friend in Edinburgh: Containing Some Observations on a Specimen of the Principles concerning Religion and Morality, said to be maintain'd in a Book lately publish'd, intituled A Treatise of Human Nature etc''. Edinburgh (1745). Contains a letter written by Hume to defend himself against charges of atheism and scepticism, while applying for a chair at Edinburgh University.
* ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1748) Contains reworking of the main points of the ''Treatise'', Book 1, with the addition of material on free will (adapted from Book 2), miracles, the Design Argument, and mitigated scepticism. ''[[Of Miracles]]'', section X of the ''Enquiry'', was often published separately.
* ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'' (1751) A reworking of material from Book 3 of the ''Treatise'', on morality, but with a significantly different emphasis. It "was thought by Hume to be the best of his writings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PoI6AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA548&amp;dq=david+hume++essay+concerning+morals+best+work&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0kLhU-74D5Ge7Aar4oCoBg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20hume%20%20essay%20concerning%20morals%20best%20work&amp;f=false |title=Samson, G., '&amp;#39;The Concise Cambridge History of English Literature'&amp;#39;, CUP Archive, 1941, p. 548 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Political Discourses'', (part II of ''[[Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary]]'' within vol. 1 of the larger ''Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects'') Edinburgh (1752). Included in ''Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects'' (1753–56) reprinted 1758–77.
* ''Political Discourses''/''Discours politiques'' (1752–1758), ''My Own life'' (1776), ''Of Essay writing'', 1742. Bilingual English-French (translated by Fabien Grandjean). Mauvezin, France: Trans-Europ-Repress, 1993, 22&amp;nbsp;cm, V-260 p. Bibliographic notes, index.
* ''[[Four Dissertations]]'' London (1757). Included in reprints of ''Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects'' (above).
* ''[[The History of England (Hume)|The History of England]]'' (Sometimes referred to as ''The History of Great Britain'') (1754–62) More a category of books than a single work, Hume's history spanned "from the invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution of 1688" and went through over 100 editions. Many considered it ''the'' standard history of England in its day.
* ''[[The Natural History of Religion]]''. Included in "Four Dissertations" (1757)
* "Sister Peg" (1760) Hume claimed to have authored an anonymous political pamphlet satirizing the failure of the British Parliament to create a Scottish militia in 1760. Although the authorship of the work is disputed, Hume wrote Dr. Alexander Carlyle in early 1761 claiming authorship. The readership of the time attributed the work to [[Adam Ferguson]], a friend and associate of Hume's who has been sometimes called "the founder of modern sociology." Some contemporary scholars concur in the judgment that Ferguson, not Hume, was the author of this work.
* "My Own Life" (1776) Penned in April, shortly before his death, this autobiography was intended for inclusion in a new edition of ''Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects''. It was first published by Adam Smith who claimed that by doing so he had incurred "ten times more abuse than the very violent attack I had made upon the whole commercial system of Great Britain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7Bef_1f_w0C&amp;pg=PA466&amp;dq=david+hume++%22ten+times+more+abuse+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PUThU9oelI3sBr2PgIgE&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20hume%20%20%22ten%20times%20more%20abuse%20%22&amp;f=false |title=Berry, CJ., Paganelli, MP. and Smith, C., '&amp;#39;The Oxford Handbook of Adam Smith'&amp;#39;, Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 466 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2013-05-16 |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1779) Published posthumously by his nephew, David Hume the Younger. Being a discussion among three fictional characters concerning the nature of God, and is an important portrayal of the argument from design. Despite some controversy, most scholars agree that the view of Philo, the most sceptical of the three, comes closest to Hume's own.

'''Deadheads for Obama''' is the name given to the February 4, 2008 reunion [[concert]] of three former members of the [[Grateful Dead]] at [[The Warfield]] in [[San Francisco]].  The show, performed one day before the [[Super Tuesday]] primary elections, was an act of support for Democratic presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]], and featured former Dead members [[Phil Lesh]], [[Bob Weir]], and [[Mickey Hart]], as well as [[John Molo]], [[Jackie Greene]], [[Steve Molitz]], [[Mark Karan]] and [[Barry Sless]].

The show marked the first time Lesh, Weir and Hart had shared the stage since 2004, and was simulcast on [[Iclips.net|the iClips Network]].

Deadheads for Obama is also a 350 member grassroots organization founded in February 2007 through Barack Obama's website; one year before the concert of the same namesake. This group collectively raised more than $150,000 for the Obama campaign.

==Setlist==
After a videotaped introduction by Barack Obama, the band played "[[Playing in the Band]]" into "Brown-Eyed Women", and continued the first set with other Grateful Dead staples "Mississippi Half-Step Uptown Toodeloo", "New Minglewood Blues", and a cover of "[[Come Together]]" by [[the Beatles]].

A short speech by Phil Lesh was followed by a four-song acoustic second set, featuring more classic Dead songs like "[[Friend of the Devil]]" and "Deal".  Then the band plugged in again to play an extended third set, including New Orleans classic "[[Iko Iko]]" (in honor of [[Mardi Gras]]), and ending with a reprise of the opener, "Playing in the Band", and an encore of "U.S. Blues".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dead.net/features/news/general-news/bob-phil-mickey-and-friends-rock-barack-warfield Lambert, Gary. "Bob, Phil, Mickey and Friends Rock for Barack at the Warfield", Dead.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete setlist was:
* First set: "Playing in the Band", "Brown-Eyed Women", "Mississippi Half-Step Uptown Toodeloo", "New Minglewood Blues", "Come Together"
* Second set (acoustic): "Deep Elem Blues", "Friend of the Devil", "Deal", "Ripple"
* Third set: "[[China Cat Sunflower]]", "The Wheel", "The Other One", "[[Sugaree]]", "Eyes of the World", "Throwing Stones", "Iko Iko", "Playing in the Band" reprise
* Encore: "U.S. Blues"

==Change Rocks==
Hart, Lesh, and Weir reunited again in support of the [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|Obama presidential campaign]], this time joined by Bill Kreutzmann, on October 13, 2008, in the [[Bryce Jordan Center]] at [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State University]], playing a concert called "Change Rocks". [[Warren Haynes]] provided guitar and vocal support for the reunion, and [[Jeff Chimenti]] played keyboards.  The performance was preceded by a set of music by members of [[the Allman Brothers Band]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/10/14/the-dead-reunite-for-obama-at-scorching-penn-state-benefit-gig/ "The Dead Reunite for Obama at Scorching Penn State Benefit Gig", ''Rolling Stone'', October 14, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hYe1qLDbm8FrwN8IFzvqN03-aIPAD93Q8MD81 "Surviving Members of Grateful Dead Rock for Obama", Associated Press, October 14, 2008]{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The set list was: "[[Truckin']]", "U.S. Blues", "Help on the Way", "Slipknot!", "Franklin's Tower",
"[[Playing in the Band]]", "[[Dark Star (song)|Dark Star]]", "[[St. Stephen (song)|St. Stephen]]", "Unbroken Chain", "The Other One", "Throwing Stones", and "Playing in the Band" reprise, with an encore of "[[Touch of Grey]]" and "[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dead.net/features/news/change-rocks-setlist "Change Rocks: The Setlist" on dead.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidential inauguration ball==
On January 20, 2009, the Dead played at one of the 10 official balls for the [[Barack Obama 2009 presidential inauguration|Inauguration of President Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/01/15/barack-obama-selects-the-dead-for-inauguration-ball-it-was-quite-an-honor/ "Barack Obama Selects the Dead for Inaugural Ball", ''Rolling Stone'', January 15, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.relix.com/Features/Daily_News/The_Dead_Reunite_at_Mid-Atlantic_Inagural_Ball__200901213651.html Greenhuas, Mike.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6005">The '''Domhnach Airgid''' (English: '''Sliver Church''') is an 8th-century Irish metalwork and wooden book [[shrine]] of the [[cumdach]] type, held at the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in Dublin&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.culturalheritageireland.ie/index.php/component/content/article/67-metalwork/188-the-domhnach-airgid- The Domhnach Airgid]". Cultural Heritage Ireland. Retrieved 1 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; since 1847.&lt;ref name="dd464" /&gt; It is traditionally associated with [[Saint Patrick]], who was thought to have had it in his possession at one point.

Domhnach Airgid comprises two separate main elements: an outer casket or box and the fragments of a 6th-9th century manuscript it was built to hold. The wooden oblong box is heavily inscribed, with lettering running right around the outer borders, and it is covered by silver and bronze panels which contain fragments of [[vellum]] manuscript of the [[Gospels]] written in Latin.&lt;ref name="Cornhill"&gt;"The Study of Celtic Literature". ''The Cornhill magazine'', Volume 11; Volume 13. Guildford: Cornhill 1993. p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-nine pages of the manuscript survive,&lt;ref name="dd464"&gt;Diringer (1986), 464&lt;/ref&gt; each about nine inches in height.&lt;ref name="oc12" /&gt;

The shrine was redesigned c 1350, when the much of the extant metalwork and [[relief]] plaques on the cover were added. The work is thus a mixture of the non-contemporary [[Insular art]] and [[International Gothic]] styles.

==Design==

Domhnach Airgid's casket was designed to hold relics and consists of three covers, with the center one being made of wood, probably from [[yew]]. Another is made from copper, plated with silver. The outer cover, pictured above, is of the highest quality, and lined with silver and decorated by [[gilding]].&lt;ref name="oc322"&gt;O'Curry (1878), 322&lt;/ref&gt; The cover contains a series of elevated carving centered on a representation of Jesus on [[Crucifix|the cross]] surrounded by eleven smaller sized figures, including a grouping of three [[apostles]], probably James, Peter and Paul, the panel showing the [[Archangel Michael]] and the Virgin and Child, a panel with a grouping of [[Saint Colmcille]], [[St. Brigid]] and Patrick, while with the saint at the lower right is thought to represent of Patrick presenting a cumdach to [[Mac Cairthinn of Clogher|St. Macartan]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://irisharchaeology.ie/2015/02/the-domhnach-airgid-an-early-irish-book-shrine/ The Domhnach Airgid, an Early Irish Book Shrine]". Irish Archaeology, 2015. Retrieved 1 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The corners of the frontispiece contain a series of running animals or [[grotesques]] placed on small mounts. A dove, representing the [[Holy Spirit]] and decorated with a crystal, hovers above Christ's head.&lt;ref name="oc323"&gt;O'Curry (1878), 323&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures are ornately and delicately carved. The cover was built to hold a number of [[relic]]s, by legend associated with Patrick. In this tradition, the shrine was thought to have been in his possession and was sanctified by him&lt;ref name="oc12"&gt;O'Curry (1861), 12&lt;/ref&gt; before he gave it to St. Macartan. It thus became a significant and prized object that was widely venerated.&lt;ref name="ot98"&gt;O'Toole (2013), 98&lt;/ref&gt;


The case was significantly remodeled around 1350 (a dating established by [[George Petrie (artist)|George Petrie]]) by the goldsmith John O’Bardan, during work commissioned by John O’Carbri, [[Clones Abbey|abbot of Clones]]. O’Bardan, whose signature appears on the object and is known to have lived in [[Drogheda]], modernised the appearance of the shrine in the contemporary International Gothic style,&lt;ref name="ot98" /&gt;&lt;ref name="h510"&gt;Hourihane (2012), 510&lt;/ref&gt; and added the figures of Jesus and the saints.&lt;ref name="ot98" /&gt; O’Carbri likely had political motivations for commissioning the redesign in the context of the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland]]. The Normans sought to undermine the established order, in part by undermining and reforming Irish Christianity, while seeking to detach it from its Celtic basis. In response, some clerics fought back by refurbishing and restoring early medieval sacred objects in order to reinforce the island's cultural identity.&lt;ref name="ot98"  /&gt;

Due to its age, the Domhnach Airgid is not in good condition. Areas of the gilding contain accumulations of dirt, and any colourisation has long since faded, giving it its current dark appearance of mostly brown and black hues.&lt;ref name="oc12" /&gt;

==Manuscript==
The manuscript is of the Cathach (literally "Battle Book") style,&lt;ref name="oc12" /&gt; indicating an apocryphal use as a rallying cry or protector in battle. There are 39 surviving leaves, with text written in the [[Insular script|Irish majuscule]] script.&lt;ref name="dd464" /&gt; The manuscript leaves are very worn down, and some have become detached from their casing.&lt;ref name="oc12" /&gt;

A '''dream diary''' (or '''dream journal''') is a [[diary]] in which dream experiences are recorded. A [[dream]] diary might include a record of nightly dreams, personal reflections and [[waking dream]] experiences. It is often used in the study of dreams and [[psychology]]. Dream diaries are also used by some people as a way to help induce  [[lucid dream]]s. They are also regarded as a useful catalyst for remembering dreams. The use of a dream diary was recommended by Ann Faraday in ''The Dream Game'' as an aid to memory and a way to preserve details, many of which are otherwise rapidly forgotten no matter how memorable the dream originally seemed.&lt;ref&gt;Faraday, Ann: ''The Dream Game'', [[Harpercollins]], March 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Keeping a dream diary conditions a person to view remembering dreams as important. Dreams can be recorded in a paper diary (as text, drawings, paintings, etc.) or via an audio recording device (as narrative, music or imitations of other auditory experiences from the dream). Many websites offer the ability to create a digital dream diary.

== Lucid dreaming ==
Dream diaries are often kept by people striving to induce and remember lucid dreams. Writing down dreams increases what is called dream recall, or the ability to remember dreams. When writing down dreams, the dreamer often searches for dream signs, or recurring themes that have been detected between dreams. Dream recall can vary from day to day but keeping a diary tends to regulate waking dream memory.

It is important to record the dreams in the diary immediately after waking up, as individuals forget the details of their dreams very quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Sponias - [http://www.freepsychologyarticles.com/how-to-keep-a-dream-journal-free-psychotherapy-in-your-own-dreams.html How to Keep a Dream Journal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819192441/http://www.freepsychologyarticles.com/how-to-keep-a-dream-journal-free-psychotherapy-in-your-own-dreams.html |date=August 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing the next day's date in the dream diary asserts a conscious thought to remember dreams, which communicates intention to the subconscious mind.  The subconscious mind then responds by fulfilling that desire.  This mental action causes the conscious and subconscious minds to work together toward the common goal of remembering the dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Condron|first=Barbara|title=The Dreamer's Dictionary|year=1994|publisher=SOM Publishing|location=Windyville, Missouri|isbn=0-944386-16-4|url=http://som.org/NewPages/Newsite07/SOMBar/Books/Titles/DreamersDictionary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== False awakenings ===
The discipline of waking up to record a dream in a diary sometimes leads to a [[false awakening]] where the dreamer records the previous dream while still in a dream. Some dream diarists report writing down the same dream one or two times in a dream before actually waking up, and recording it in a physical dream diary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/IJoDR/article/download/9085/pdf|title = False awakenings in light of the dream protoconsciousness theory: A study in lucid dreamers|last = Buzzi|first = Giorgio|date = September 2011|journal = International Journal of Dream Research|doi = |pmid = |access-date = April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific uses==
Followers of [[Eckankar]] frequently keep dream diaries, since they view dreams as important teaching tools and as a gateway to "Soul Travel," or the shifting of one's consciousness to ever-higher states of being.&lt;ref&gt;Klemp, H. (1999). ''The Art of Spiritual Dreaming''. Minneapolis, MN: [http://www.eckankar.org/dream.html Eckankar]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7763">'''Eau de Cologne''' ({{IPA-fr|o d(ə) kɔlɔɲ|lang}}; German: '''''Kölnisch Wasser''''' {{IPA-de|ˈkœlnɪʃ ˈvasɐ|}}; meaning "Water from Cologne"), or simply '''cologne''', is a [[perfume]] originating from [[Cologne]], [[Germany]]. Originally mixed by [[Johann Maria Farina]] in 1709, it has since come to be a generic term for scented formulations in typical concentration of 2–5% and also more depending upon its type [[essential oil]]s or a blend of extracts, alcohol, and water. 
In a base of dilute [[ethanol]] (70–90%), eau de cologne contains a mixture of [[citrus]] oils including oils of [[lemon]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]], [[tangerine]], [[clementine]], [[Bergamot orange|bergamot]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]], [[grapefruit]], [[blood orange]], and [[bitter orange]]. It can also contain oils of [[neroli]], [[lavender]], [[rosemary]], [[thyme]], [[oregano]], [[petitgrain]] (orange leaf), [[jasmine]], [[olive]], [[oleaster]], and [[tobacco]].

In contemporary American English usage, the term "cologne" has become a generic term for [[perfume]]s usually marketed towards men. It also may signify a less concentrated (but more affordable) version of a popular perfume. 

==History==
[[File:1811-Rosoli-Flacon.jpg|thumb|An eau de cologne by Farina (1811).]]
[[File:Eau de Cologne 1280470.JPG|thumb|4711 cologne - the most famous Eau de Cologne.]]
The original ''Eau de Cologne'' is a spirit-citrus perfume launched in [[Cologne]] in 1709 by [[Giovanni Maria Farina]] (1685–1766), an [[Italy|Italian]] perfume maker from [[Santa Maria Maggiore, Piedmont |Santa Maria Maggiore]] [[Valle Vigezzo]]. In 1708, Farina wrote to his brother Jean Baptiste: "I have found a fragrance that reminds me of an Italian spring morning, of mountain daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain".&lt;ref&gt;Eckstein and Sykes, p 8&lt;/ref&gt; He named his fragrance ''Eau de Cologne'', in honour of his new hometown.&lt;ref name="Fischer"&gt;Fischer&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Original Eau de Cologne [[4711]]'', is named after its location at Glockengasse No. 4711. It was also developed in the 18th century by [[Wilhelm Mülhens]] and produced in Cologne since at least 1799 and is therefore probably one of the oldest still produced fragrances in the world. On 12 December 2006, the perfumes and cosmetics company [[Mäurer &amp; Wirtz]] took over 4711 from [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] and has expanded it to a whole brand since then.

The ''Eau de Cologne'' composed by Farina was used only as a perfume and delivered to "nearly all royal houses in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;Farina [[Fragrance Museum]] information leaflet&lt;/ref&gt; His ability to produce a constantly homogeneous fragrance consisting of dozens of monoessences was seen as a sensation at the time. A single vial of this ''aqua mirabilis'' ([[Latin]] for miracle water) cost half the annual salary of a civil servant.&lt;ref name="Fischer"/&gt; When free trade was established in Cologne by the French in 1797, the success of ''Eau de Cologne'' prompted countless other businessmen to sell their own fragrances under the name of ''Eau de Cologne''. Giovanni Maria Farina's formula has been produced in [[Cologne]] since 1709 by [[Johann Maria Farina gegenüber dem Jülichs-Platz|Farina opposite the Jülichplatz]]&lt;ref name="Fischer"/&gt; and to this day remains a secret. His shop at Obenmarspforten opened in 1709 and is today the world's oldest fragrance factory.

In 1806, Jean Marie Joseph Farina, a grand-grand-nephew of [[Giovanni Maria Farina]] (1685–1766), opened a perfumery business in [[Paris]] that was later sold to [[Roger &amp; Gallet]]. That company now owns the rights to ''Eau de Cologne extra vieille'' in contrast to the ''Original Eau de Cologne'' from [[Cologne]]. Originally the water of Cologne was believed to have the power to ward off bubonic plague.&lt;ref&gt;Monk, Paul M. S. ''Physical Chemistry: Understanding Our Chemical World''. 2004. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; By drinking the cologne the citrus oil scent would be exuded through the pores, repelling fleas. Much as flea shampoo for dogs can be based on citrus oils today.

In modern times, ''Eau de Cologne'' or "cologne", has become a generic term. The term "cologne" can be applied to perfume for men or women, but it conventionally refers to perfumes marketed towards men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.germanywanderer.com/the-history-behind-eau-de-cologne/|title=The history behind eau de cologne|publisher=Germany Wanderer|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drinking==
In former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] countries (mainly Russia), varieties of Troynoy ''Eau de Cologne'' may be used as a [[surrogate alcohol]] among poor [[alcohol intoxication|alcoholics]], especially because it is very cheaply priced compared to [[vodka]].&lt;ref name=drinking&gt;{{cite news|title='Aftershave drink' kills Russians |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6752515.stm |newspaper=[[BBC News Online|BBC News]]|date=2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Endeavor Talent Agency''' was a [[Beverly Hills]]-based talent agency founded by [[Ari Emanuel]], Rick Rosen, Tom Strickler, and David Greenblatt. It was launched in March 1995 and went on to represent a wide variety of acclaimed film and television stars. In April 2009, Emanuel and Endeavor executive [[Patrick Whitesell]] orchestrated a merger with [[William Morris Agency|The William Morris Agency]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2009-05-28/news/william-morris-it-39-s-a-takeover-not-a-merger |title=It's A Takeover, Not A Merger |work= [[LA Weekly]] |date=May 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in [[William Morris Endeavor]].

==History==

=== Formation ===

The roots of Endeavor can be traced to the [[ICM Partners|ICM Agency]], where founders Emanuel, Rosen, Strickler, and Greenblatt were all top television agents. In early 1995, they formed a plan to start their own agency, which was ultimately discovered by ICM Chairman Jeff Berg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Galloway | first = Stephen | title = Jeff Berg Speaks: Plans for New Agency, What Really Happened at ICM (Exclusive) | date = 2013-03-05 | publisher = The Hollywood Reporter | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jeff-berg-new-agency-icm-426189?page=show}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 29, the four agents were fired from ICM and immediately formed Endeavor. The agency began operations on March 30, working mainly with television clients from an office above the former [[Islands Restaurant]] in South Beverly Hills. Co-founder Ari Emanuel and the Endeavor Agency were the basis for the character [[Ari Gold (Entourage)|Ari Gold]], and his Miller Gold Agency, on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Real-life Ari admits: I thought ‘Entourage’ would be a loser|url=http://www.thedaily.com/page/2011/11/02/110211-gossip-ari-emanuel/|publisher=The Daily|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1996–2003: Expansion / Whitesell Joins ===

In 1996, Endeavor moved to a new high-rise building at 9601 Wilshire Boulevard in [[Beverly Hills]]. Three new partners from [[Creative Artists Agency|CAA]] quickly joined the company: David Lonner, Doug Robinson, and Adam Venit.  Lonner's clientele included the feature directors that Endeavor needed to solidify its standing as a full service agency.  Robinson and Venit were the first actors' agents and had a client list that included [[Hank Azaria]], [[Adam Sandler]], and [[David Spade]] (all of whom are now represented by WME).

The Endeavor talent department grew dramatically during the next eight years, mainly with the 2001 addition of former CAA talent head, [[Patrick Whitesell]]. Whitesell led the development of the agency's list of feature film headliners, with a talent pool that included [[Ben Affleck]], [[Christian Bale]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Hugh Jackman]], and [[Jude Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Brodesser | first = Claude | title = CAA’s Whitesell eyes a new Endeavor | date = 2001-02-25 | publisher = Variety | url = https://variety.com/2001/more/news/caa-s-whitesell-eyes-a-new-endeavor-1117794305/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group also signed several comedy stars during that period, including [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], [[Kevin James]], and [[Charlie Sheen]].

=== 2003–2009: Continued Growth ===

By 2003, Endeavor had become one of the industry's fastest-growing talent agencies. In June of that year, they relocated to 9601 Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, which is now the current headquarters of WME. The Wilshire office was designed by [[UCLA]] professor and architect [[Neil Denari]] with wall graphics by 2x4 of [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmda-inc.com/index_content.html Neil M.

In 2006, agent Nancy Josephson left ICM after the company went through an ownership change.  Endeavor quickly brought in Josephson and her clients{{spaced ndash}} ''[[Friends]]'' creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane, [[Craig Ferguson]], [[Tyra Banks]], and director David Frankel.  Soon after, ICM agents Matt Solo and Robert Newman joined as well.  Solo's roster included ''[[The Shield]]'' creator Shawn Ryan, while Newman's brought esteemed film directors [[Guillermo Del Toro]], [[Baz Luhrmann]], [[Danny Boyle]] and [[Robert Rodriguez]].

2008 brought four key additions from [[United Talent Agency|UTA]], including talent agents Sharon Jackson and Nick Stevens.  Their clients, [[Will Arnett]], [[Jack Black]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[Amy Poehler]], and [[Ben Stiller]], bolstered the agency's comedy department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cieply|first=Michael|title=Agents Replaying a Hollywood Drama|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/business/media/27agent.html?_r=3&amp;sq=endeavor&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin&amp;scp=1&amp;pagewanted=all| work = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009 - Present ===
{{main|William Morris Endeavor}}

In 2008, Emanuel and Whitesell began preliminary discussions with the William Morris Agency about a company merger. By April 2009, the announcement was made and '''William Morris Endeavor''' was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Finke | first = Nikki | title = Latest WMA-Endeavor Merger Update: Hollywood History In The Making Today: Endeavor And William Morris Vote Yes | date = 2009-04-27 | publisher = Deadline | url = http://www.deadline.com/2009/04/latest-wma-endeavor-merger-update/}}&lt;/ref&gt; WMA ultimately relocated to Endeavor's Beverly Hills office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Finke | first = Nikki | title = WME Will Stay In Endeavor Headquarters Instead Of Moving To New Morris Building | date = 2009-10-09 | publisher = Deadline | url = http://www.deadline.com/2009/10/wme-not-moving-to-new-building-instead-will-stay-in-endeavor-headquarters/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Emanuel and Whitesell retained the titles of Co-CEOs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6104">During the beginning of the German invasions during [[World War II]], [[Jacques Jaujard]], the  director of the French [[Réunion des Musées Nationaux|Musées Nationaux]], foreshadowed the fall of France and decided to organize the evacuation of the [[Louvre]] art collection in province.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web

== Evacuation of the art collection ==
[[File:Nike descending staircase 3sept1939.jpg|thumb|right|The Winged Victory of Samothrace was carefully lowered down a ramp]]
[[File:La Grande Gallerie désertée.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The Grande Gallerie in September 1939]]
On 25 August 1939, the Louvre was closed for 3 days, officially for repairs. However, many of the Louvre art collection was hauled on trucks (203 vehicles transporting 1862 wooden cases) and sent to [[Château de Chambord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some of the art pieces were too big to be fit in a truck. For example [[The Raft of the Medusa]] had to be covered with a blanket. When the truck initially arrived at Versailles on his route to Chambord, the canvas touched an electric cable and created a short-circuit which switched off the electricity in the whole town. After that, the routes were carefully planned to avoid this type of problems, and attendants which poles were responsible to deal with electric or phone cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Knopf]], pp. 54–55. {{ISBN|978-0-679-40069-1}}; OCLC 246524635&lt;/ref&gt;

The last art piece to leave the museum was the [[Winged Victory of Samothrace]], which was moved on September 3, 1939, the day the French ultimatum to Germany expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Throughout the war, the arts pieces were clandestinely moved from chateau to chateau to avoid being taken back by the Nazis.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; For example, the ''Mona Lisa'' was moved from Chambord to several castles and abbeys, to finish at the end of the war at the [[Musée Ingres]] in [[Montauban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| quote=''The only wartime documents available about the Mona Lisa say that on 27 August 1939 it was packed in a specially-marked crate, tailor-made in 1938, of double-thick poplar wood. Along with other artworks from French national museums, it was sent for storage, first to Chambord Castle in the Loire Valley. On 5 June 1940, it was transferred to Chauvigny on a cushioned stretcher in the back of an ambulance, which had been sealed to keep the humidity constant (the official who accompanied the painting arrived nearly asphyxiated from the lack of circulation in the sealed vehicle). In September, it moved again, to the Ingres Museum in Montauban, before a final move to Montal in 1942''

== The arrival of the German army in Paris ==
On 16 August 1940, count [[Franz von Wolff-Metternich]], who was responsible of the conservation of the French art collections under the [[Kunstschutz]] principle, arrived in Paris to oversee France’s art collection, but the museum was almost empty.

[[File:The Francesco St Jerome - 2018.jpg|thumb||250px|The Francesco ''St Jerome '']]
The '''Francesco ''St Jerome''''' is an [[oil painting]] on copper attributed to the circle of the Italian Renaissance artist [[Palma the Younger]], dating from c. 1595. 
 
The painting was believed to possibly be the lost original work by Palma when it was rediscovered in January 2008 and became known to the public upon its featuring in a number of newspapers in the United Kingdom and around the world.

Named after Palma's patron, [[Francesco Maria II della Rovere]], Duke of Urbino. The Duke is believed to have commissioned the original composition and the Francesco St Jerome is the finest surviving example of the now believed lost masterpiece.

After its discovery, the painting was loaned for two years to The [[Courtauld Gallery]] as a teaching aid to students. Offering for academic study a rare surviving example of copper painting from the period, This included extensive research and restoration in an attempt to ascertain its authorship.

The painting dates from the height of Palma's fame and artistic ability and was most likely created by one of his students or a pupil in the workshop of Hendrik Goltioz, who famously produced an engraving of the composition. One of the most outstanding aspects of the painting is its fine detail and vividly bright colors: paintings on copper often retain their brightness and condition better than those on canvas. The painting is currently part of The Albertyne Collections on loan to History Portal, a [[not for profit]] community, arts, history, and cultural focus organisation.

'''Furby''' is an American [[Electronics|electronic]] [[robot]]ic toy released in 1998 by [[Tiger Electronics]]. It resembles a [[hamster]] or [[owl]]-like creature and went through a period of being a "[[Fad|must-have]]" toy following its [[Christmas and holiday season|holiday season]] launch, with continual sales until 2000. Over 40 million Furbies were sold during the three years of its original production, with 1.8 million sold in 1998, and 14 million in 1999. Its speaking capabilities were translated into 24 languages.

Furbies were the first successful attempt to produce and sell a [[domestic robot|domestically-aimed robot]]. A newly purchased Furby starts out speaking entirely "Furbish", the unique language that all Furbies use, but is programmed to start using English words and phrases in place of Furbish over time. This process is intended to resemble the process of learning English.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://web.mit.edu/sturkle/www/encounterswithkismet.pdf |date=2004-09-30 |publisher=[[MIT]] |title=Encounters with Kismet and Cog: Children Respond to Relational Artifacts |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The updated Emoto-Tronic Furby, with voice-recognition and more complex facial movements, was sold by [[Hasbro]] between 2005–2007. They released another updated Furby with [[LCD]] eyes and a [[mobile app]] for the holiday season in 2012.

==History==

===Initial creation===
Dave Hampton and Caleb Chung spent nine months creating the Furby (in addition to nine months spent designing the toy). After two attempts at licensing the concept, they invited fellow toy and game inventor Richard C. Levy to join their efforts to sell Furby. Levy brought Furby to Tiger Electronics and Tiger's Roger Shiffman bought the rights to it. Furby's first public appearance was at the American International Toy Fair in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Banks |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2002/june/toys/index.html |title=Furby Co-Inventor Richard Levy |publisher=NPR |date=2002-06-18 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/rlevy.html |title=Inventor of the Week: Archive |publisher=Web.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sloane |first=Julie |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2002/07/01/325614/index.htm |title=Game Theories The man who made the Furby fly explains how he comes up with his ideas. – July 1, 2002 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2002-07-01 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://andelman.com/2010/10/complete-idiots-guide-author-and-furby-inventor-richard-c-levy-creates-ways-to-avoid-mr-media/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306044136/http://andelman.com/2010/10/complete-idiots-guide-author-and-furby-inventor-richard-c-levy-creates-ways-to-avoid-mr-media/ |date=March 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Furby, a McDonaldsToy circa 2001, with bright blue coat.jpg|thumb|Furby toy from McDonald's]]
Furbies originally retailed for about US$35,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9810/05/furby/index.html |date=1998-10-05 |publisher=CNN |title=New toy an interactive fur ball |accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and upon release, they sold very well. Catapulting demand during the 1998 Christmas period drove the resale price over $100, and sometimes as high as several hundred dollars. Furbies sold for over $300 in newspapers and in auctions. Nicknames were given to the different aesthetic varieties, and sellers assigned rarity values to them.

The significant aftermarket demand (and price) for the toy resulted in cases of fraud in which customers paid for Furbies that were never delivered. Parental battles, arguments, and fights increased rapidly as supplies dwindled, and when retail supplies ran out, parents turned to the [[Internet]], where Furbies could be purchased for two, three, or more multiples of their retail price. During one 12-month period, a total of 27 million Furby toys were sold.&lt;ref name="Furby 4"&gt;{{cite web|last=Collecting|first=Furbys|title=Furbys &amp; Furby Collecting|url=http://www.worldcollectorsnet.com/features/furbys/|work=Yes|publisher=Word CollectorsNet|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 revival===
2005 saw the reintroduction of Furby with the release of the new Emoto-Tronic Furby.

===2012 revival===
On April 12, 2012, it was announced that Hasbro would be making a new line of Furbies. The new line was released in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/308423/furby-s-coming-back-five-things-to-know-about-this-iconic-toy |title=Furby's Coming Back!

Online |date=2012-04-12 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2012 there were sixteen colors: Teal, white, black, purple, tangerine-tango, yellow, aqua, navy blue, plum, pink, pink/teal, orange/blue, black/pink, blue/yellow, teal/purple, gray/teal.&lt;ref name=Furby&gt;{{cite web|last=Hasbro|first=Electronics|title=Furby|url=http://m.furby.com/furby_en_US/catalog?cid=2750936&amp;p=2&amp;ps=10&amp;s=7&amp;k=|work=Yes|publisher=Hasbro|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furbies were one of the eleven toys named top toys for Christmas 2013 by the Toy Retailers Association at the DreamToys Convention where they unveil their predictions for most popular holiday toys annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Toys for Christmas 2013|url=http://www.aol.com/article/2013/12/07/top-toys-for-christmas-2013/20783883/#!slide=1915852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Classic Furbies===
The main reason for their popularity{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} was because of apparent "intelligence", reflected in their ability to develop language skills.

Furbies can communicate with one another via an [[infrared]] port located between their eyes. Furbies start out speaking entirely "Furbish", a language with short words, simple syllables, and various other sounds. They are programmed, however, to speak less and less Furbish and more and more [[English language|English]] as they "grow".

There was a common misconception that they repeated words that were said around them. This belief most likely stemmed from the fact that it is possible to have the Furby say certain pre-programmed words or phrases more often by petting it whenever it said these words. As a result of this myth, several [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]] banned them from their offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9901/13/nsa.furby.ban.01 |publisher=CNN |date=1999-01-13 |title=Furby a threat to national security? |accessdate=2006-12-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060828044552/http://www.cnn.com/US/9901/13/nsa.furby.ban.01 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple electric motor and a system of cams and gears close the Furby's eyes and mouth, raise its ears, and lift it off the ground in a ''faux'' display of mobility.

The originals are popular with many [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hackers]] as they can be dissected and made to do interesting things. In particular, their advanced audio capabilities and various sensory interfaces make them popular with the [[circuit bending]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|LPvW8R1zbD0|Circuit-bent Furby}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circuit-bent.net/furby-bending-tutorial.html |title=Furby Bending Tutorial |first=Kevin |last=Rees |publisher=Circuit-Bent.Net |accessdate=2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Furbies===

====Furby Babies====
In 1999, the Furby Babies line was introduced. Furby Babies are smaller than the original, have higher voices, and cannot dance, but they switch to speaking English more quickly. They also have an extended vocabulary and different "Easter eggs" and "games" built into them. Furby babies come in 24 different colors. All have white eyelashes and one of six different eyecolors.

====Furby Friends====
Novel Furbies were also released, including an interactive Furby-like "Gizmo", from the film ''[[Gremlins]]'', a Furby-like "Interactive [[Yoda]]" based on the Star Wars character, and a Furby-like "Interactive [[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]" from the movie of the same name. Another "friend of Furby", called "Shelby", is similar to Furby, but looks like a clam, has vast improvements in memory, and has a different personality; it was released in 2001 and can communicate with the original Furbies and Furby Babies. They also have sensors that can sense loud sounds, can sense being upside down (they say things like "Shiver me timbers" and "Walk the plank" when left them upside-down for an extended period of time), and they laugh when "tickled" (their antennae&amp;nbsp;– or "tennies", as they like to call them). They also purr when "petted". They can be fed by sticking a finger in their mouth. Similarly, Shelbies do not have their own names, unlike the classic Furbies. Shelbies are also capable of knowing if it is talking to a Furby or another Shelby, saying phrases such as "Where's Furby?"—though they cannot differentiate between a Furby and a Furby Baby—they just assume it is a Furby. In addition to English, Shelbies also know some Furbish words and also have their own unique language called "Shelbish".{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

====Emoto-Tronic Furbies====

This Furby was released in August 2005. Larger than the previous version, the new Furbies have been upgraded with a more emotional face and a voice recognition system, enabling them to communicate with humans. Unlike the Furbies originally released, just one order is necessary to make them 'sleep', and they have an on/off switch. They can communicate with other Emoto-tronic Furbies, though to a lesser extent than the communication between original Furbies, and they cannot themselves communicate with the original Furbies nor Funky Furbies. They also lack light sensors and basic motion sensors and do not respond to loud sounds as the originals do. These Furbies, according to the story they come packed with, are from Furby Island.

====Emoto-Tronic Furby Babies====
In 2006, a new version of Furby baby was released, with most notable features being the new look and a more "baby-ish" appearance in contrast to the Emoto-Tronic Furby adult. They also have considerably fewer features than the "adult" Furby, with a very limited vocabulary and a lower level of interactivity. Another notable feature of the 2006 Emoto-Tronic Baby Furby is the movable "legs" which unfurl when Furby baby is awake. Although they were a European exclusive, they were sold in the US via the Hasbro Toy Shop website.

====Emoto-Tronic Funky Furbies====
The Funky Furbies were released in August 2006 outside the United States. They are limited to two color combinations (pink and yellow; purple and green), and they can sing three new songs and dance. They can be taught dance routines and remember them.

====2012 Furbies====
A new Furby was released in the fall of 2012. It has more expressive LCD eyes, a wider range of motions, its own [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app, and the ability to adapt its personality in reaction to user behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=8/24/12 12:00pm 8/24/12 12:00pm |url=https://gizmodo.com/5937402/the-new-furby-review-absolute-horror |title=The New Furby Review: Absolute Horror |publisher=Gizmodo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The on-off switch is replaced with a reset button; the Furby turns itself off after one minute of inactivity.

====Furby Party Rockers====
Furby's smaller friends launched March 2013 and unlike their full-sized Furby companions, which grow and learn through human interaction, each Party Rocker is born with its own unique personality, making ready to interact with its owner straight from the box. There are four Furby Party Rockers, called Twitby, Fussby, Scoffby and Loveby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furbypartyrockers.co.uk/ |title=Furby Party Rockers |publisher=Furby Party Rockers |date= |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Furby Boom====
In summer of 2013, about a year after the Furby 2012 came out, a new Furby was released with new different colors and new Personalities. It has a brand new [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)]] app, called Furby BOOM, with many new features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2427353,00.asp|title=Furby Boom|author=|date=|work=PCMAG}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/11196342/Furby-that-interacts-with-iPads-is-among-must-have-Christmas-toys.html|title=Furby that interacts with iPads is among 'must-have' Christmas toys|author=|date=30 October 2014|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Furblings (toy version)====
In June 2014, a toy version of the Furblings from the Furby Boom app was released along with a Golden limited time one.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} It can communicate with Furby Booms, and can be used with the app too.

====Furby Boom Crystal====
The release for Christmas 2014 is called the Furby Boom Crystal series, with a redesign of the ears, face and feet and a new bright neon fur. The [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] apps have also been redesigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Furby Boom Crystal Series Review|url=http://boomcrystaltoys.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Furby Boom Crystal Furblings====
In early 2015, it announced toy version of the Furby Boom Crystal Furblings from the app were released. Like the other Furblings, it can communicate with Furby Boom Crystals, and be used with the app.

====Furbacca====
In June 2015, a Furby that resembles Chewbacca from Star Wars was released. It is similar to the Furby Boom because it can hatch Furblings with the same app and more. It is known as the Wookie Furby and the new Furby Friend.

====Furby Connect====
In 2016 another new Furby with more expressive eyes and movements was released, along with an app containing a whole world of Furblings for it to interact with. The Furby Connect has a translucent plastic joystick on its head which lights up different colors when toggled and is used to control games played with Furblings in the app. Unlike the 2012 Furby and Furby Boom, the Furby Connect does not change personalities. However it can sing songs that it "learns" from the app.

==Security concerns==
On January 13, 1999, it was reported the [[National Security Agency]] of the United States banned Furbies from entering NSA's property due to concerns that they may be used to record and repeat classified information, advising those that see any on NSA property to "contact their Staff Security Officer for guidance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/254094.stm|title=BBC News – Americas – Furby toy or Furby spy?|author=|date=|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/furbies-banned-at-us-spy-base-1046935.html|title=Furbies banned at US spy base|author=|date=|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9901/13/nsa.furby.ban.01 |title=CNN – Furby a threat to national security? – January 13, 1999 |author= |date= |work=archive.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826021319/http://www.cnn.com/US/9901/13/nsa.furby.ban.01/ |archivedate=August 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Shiffman, the owner of Tiger Electronics, stated that "Furby has absolutely no ability to do any recording whatsoever," and that he would have gladly told the NSA this if he was asked by anyone from the spy agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/14/julianborger1 |title=Secret agent Furby sneaks into spies' inner sanctum |date=14 January 1999 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2017}} Additionally, Dave Hampton demonstrated that Furby's microphone can't record any sound at all, and can only hear a single monotonous beep if a loud sound is produced around Furby, and no words or waveforms can be made out at all.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} He too was never questioned by the NSA.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} The ban was eventually withdrawn.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Security researchers discovered that the microphone on a Furby Connect can be remotely activated and used to record voice through a [[Bluetooth]] connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/technology/connected-toys-hacking.html?hpw&amp;rref=technology&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=well-region&amp;region=bottom-well&amp;WT.nav=bottom-well|title=A Cute Toy Just Brought a Hacker Into Your Home|last=Frenkel|first=Sheera|date=21 December 2017|work=[[New York Times]]|access-date=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Furbish-English phrases==
"Furbish" is the Furbies' language, with simple syllables, short words, and various sounds. A newly purchased Furby starts out speaking entirely in Furbish. Over time, the Furby gradually replaces Furbish words and phrases with English.
* '''wee-tah-kah-loo-loo''': Tell me a joke.
* '''wee-tah-kah-wee-loo''': Tell me a story.
* '''wee-tee-kah-wah-tee''': Sing me a song.
* '''u-nye-loo-lay-doo?''': Do you want to play?
* '''u-nye-ay-tay-doo?''': Are you hungry?
* '''u-nye-boh-doo?''': How are you?
* '''u-nye-way-loh-nee-way''': Go to sleep now.
* '''u-nye-noh-lah''': Show me a dance.

Furbies may say these Furbish words:
* '''doo?''': What? (Furbies say this when called)
* '''doo-dah''': Yes. (Furbies say this in response to a command before doing it)
* '''boo''': No. (Furbies say this when they do not want to carry out a command)
* '''yoo?''': Why will you not play with me today? (This usually means the Furby is upset)

==Film adaptation==
[[Bob Weinstein]] announced in November 2016 that a Furby film adaptation is to be produced by [[The Weinstein Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McNary |first=Dave |date=2 November 2016 |title=AFM: Bob Weinstein Unveils Furby Movie for TWC-Dimension |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/afm-bob-weinstein-furby-movie-twc-dimension-1201907667/ |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |access-date=10 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was written by Daniel Persitz and Devon Kliger, and will contain both [[live action]] and [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] characters.&lt;ref name=slash&gt;{{cite news |last=Anderton |first=Ethan |date=4 November 2016 |title=There’s a Furby Movie in the Works, Because That Toy Was a Thing Once |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/furby-movie/ |publisher=[[/Film]] |access-date=10 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to the film's narrative, Hasbro executive Stephen Davis stated that "we think that this can resonate as a [[four-quadrant movie|four-quadrant film]].

A '''Greek chorus''', or simply '''chorus''' ({{lang-grc-gre|χορός}}, ''khoros'') in the context of [[Ancient Greek]] [[Greek tragedy|tragedy]], [[Greek comedy|comedy]], [[satyr plays]], and modern works inspired by them, is a homogeneous, non-individualised group of performers, who comment with a collective voice on the dramatic action.&lt;ref&gt;Pavis (1998, p. 53)&lt;/ref&gt;  The chorus consisted of between 12 and 50 players, who variously danced, sang or spoke their lines in unison and sometimes wore masks.

==Etymology==
Historian [[H. D. F. Kitto]] argues that the word "chorus" gives us hints about its function in the plays of ancient Greece: "The Greek verb ''choreuo'', 'I am a member of the chorus', has the sense 'I am dancing'. The word ''ode'' means not something recited or declaimed, but 'a song'. The 'orchestra', in which a chorus had its being, is literally a 'dancing floor'."&lt;ref name=kitto&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kitto|first=H.D.F.|authorlink=H. D. F. Kitto|title=The Greek Chorus|journal=Educational Theatre Journal|date=March 1956|volume=8|issue=1|pages=1–8|jstor=3203909|doi=10.2307/3203909}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this, it can be inferred that the chorus danced and sang poetry.

==Dramatic function==
[[Play (theatre)|Plays]] of the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek theatre]] always included a chorus that offered a variety of background and summary information to help the audience follow the performance. They commented on themes, and, as [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] proposed in the early 19th century to subsequent controversy, demonstrated how the audience might react to the drama.&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, August Wilhelm. 1846. ''Vorlesungen über dramatische Kunst und Literatur 1''. translated by John Black under the title ''Course of Lectures on Dramatic Art and Litereature'' (London, 1846; reprint, New York, 1973), 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schlegel, the Chorus is "the ideal spectator", and conveys to the actual spectator "a lyrical and musical expression of his own emotions, and elevates him to the region of contemplation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schlegel|first1=August Wilhelm|title=A Course of Lectures on Dramatic Art and Literature|date=1846|page=70|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xdhuRGJcanQC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many of these plays, the chorus expressed to the audience what the main characters could not say, such as their hidden fears or secrets. The chorus often provided other characters with the insight they needed.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Some historians argue that the chorus was itself considered to be an actor.&lt;ref name="montgomery"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Montgomery|first=H.C.|title=Some Later Uses of the Greek Tragic Chorus|journal=The Classical Journal|date=December 1942|volume=38|issue=3|pages=148–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have considered [[Sophocles]] to be superior to [[Euripides]] in his choral writing. Of the two, Sophocles also won more dramatic contests. His chorus passages were more relevant to the plot and more integrated in tragedies, whereas the Euripidean choruses seemingly had little to do with the plot and were often bystanders.&lt;ref name="weiner"/&gt; Aristotle stated in his ''Poetics'':

{{quotation|"The chorus too should be regarded as one of the actors; it should be an integral part of the whole, and share in the action, not in the manner of Euripides but of Sophocles".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'', chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The chorus represents, on stage, the general population of the particular story, in sharp contrast with many of the themes of the ancient Greek plays which tended to be about individual heroes, gods, and goddesses.  They were often the same sex as the main character.&lt;ref name="montgomery"/&gt; In [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]]'', the chorus comprises the elderly men of [[Argos]], whereas in Euripides' ''[[The Bacchae]]'', they are a group of eastern [[Bacchants|bacchantes]], and in Sophocles' ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'', the chorus represents the women of Argos. In Aeschylus' ''[[The Eumenides]]'', however, the chorus takes the part of a host of avenging [[Furies]].

==Choral structure and size==
The lines of choral odes provide evidence that they were sung. Normal syllabic structure has long sounds that are twice the length of short sounds. However, some lyrics in Greek odes have long syllables that are equal to 3, 4 and 5 shorter syllables. Spoken words cannot do that, suggesting that this was a danced and sung rhythm.&lt;ref name=kitto/&gt;

The chorus originally consisted of fifty members, but some later playwrights changed the size. Aeschylus likely lowered the number to twelve, and Sophocles raised it again to fifteen.&lt;ref name="weiner"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiner| first=Albert| title=The Function of the Tragic Greek Chorus|journal=Theatre Journal|date=May 1980|volume=32|issue=2| pages=205–212| doi=10.2307/3207113| jstor=3207113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen members were used by Euripides and Sophocles in [[tragedy|tragedies]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Edwin and Alvin Goldfarb (1999) ''Theater, The Lively Art'', McGraw-Hill, New York {{ISBN|0-07-240718-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chorus stood in the orchestra.&lt;ref name="weiner"/&gt; There were twenty-four members in [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedies]].&lt;ref name=Brockett&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, pp. 22–23), Pavis (1998, p. 53), Rehm (1992, p. 26)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stage management==
The chorus performed using several techniques, including singing, dancing, narrating, and acting.&lt;ref name=Brockett/&gt; There is evidence that there were strong rhythmic components to their speaking.&lt;ref name=kitto/&gt;

They often communicated in song form, but sometimes spoke their lines in unison. The chorus had to work in unison to help explain the play as there were only one to three actors on stage who were already playing several parts each. As the [[Greek theatre]]s were so large, the chorus' actions had to be exaggerated and their voices clear so that everyone could see and hear them. To do this, they used techniques such as synchronization, echo, ripple, physical theatre and the use of masks to aid them. A Greek chorus was often led by a [[coryphaeus]]. They also served as the ancient equivalent for a curtain, as their parodos (entering procession) signified the beginnings of a play and their exodos (exit procession) served as the curtains closing.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Decline in antiquity==
Before the introduction of multiple, interacting actors by [[Aeschylus]], the Greek chorus was the main performer in relation to a solitary actor.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, 1898, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitto, 2002, pp. 22, 27&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of the chorus declined after the 5th century [[BCE]], when the chorus began to be separated from the dramatic action. Later dramatists depended on the chorus less than their predecessors. As dialogue and characterization became more important, the chorus made less of an appearance.&lt;ref name="montgomery"/&gt; However, historian Alan Hughes argues that there was no such thing as decline, but rather the slow dissolution of one form into another: {{quote|At their best, they may have become performance art, blending music, lyrics, and dance, performed by polished ''choreutai'' and accompanied by distinguished musicians. That is neither improvement nor decline: it is simply change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Alan|title=Performing Greek Comedy| year=2012| publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=9781107009301}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Modern choruses==
Musical theatre and [[grand opera]] sometimes incorporate a singing chorus that sometimes serves a similar purpose as the Greek chorus, as noted in ''Six Plays by Rodgers and Hammerstein'': "The singing chorus is used frequently to interpret the mental and emotional reactions of the principal characters, after the manner of a Greek chorus."&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers and Hammerstein. ''Six Plays by Rodgers and Hammerstein'', p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Italian Renaissance]], there was a renewed interest in the theatre of ancient Greece. The [[Florentine Camerata]] crafted the first operas out of the [[intermezzo|intermezzi]] that acted as comic or musical relief during the dramas of the time. These were based entirely on the Greek chorus, as historian H.C. Montgomery argues.&lt;ref name="montgomery"/&gt;

[[Richard Wagner]] discussed Greek drama and the Greek chorus extensively in his writings, including "[[Art and Revolution]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} His longest work, ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', (''The Ring of the Nibelung'') is based in the style of ''[[Oresteia]]'' with parallels in rhythm and overall structure (both have three parts, with the exception of ''[[Das Rheingold]]'', the prelude to ''The Ring of the Nibelung'').&lt;ref name="montgomery"/&gt; Wagner said of himself, "History gave me a model also for that ideal relation of the theater to the public which I had in mind. I found it in the drama of Ancient Athens".{{citation needed| date=November 2013}} A Greek chorus is also used in the [[Woody Allen]] film ''[[Mighty Aphrodite]]'', in which the chorus gives advice to the [[neuroticism|neurotic]] main character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garland|first1=Robert|title=Ancient Greece: Everyday Life in the Birthplace of Western Civilization|date=2008|publisher=Sterling|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-1-4549-0908-8|page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are some examples for each interval:

In addition, there are various [[solmization]] systems (including [[solfeggio]], [[sargam (music)|sargam]], and [[numerical sight-singing]]) that assign specific syllables to different notes of the [[scale (music)|scale]]. Among other things, this makes it easier to hear how intervals sound in different contexts, such as starting on different notes of the same scale.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10834">The '''Irish Exhibition of Living Art''' ('''IELA''') was a yearly exhibition of Irish abstract expressionism and avant-garde Irish art that was started in 1943 by [[Mainie Jellett]].&lt;ref name=NYTIMES&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Doherty|first=Brian|title=In Dublin: Pubs, Poets, Painters-Alive, Alive-O|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/116068288/|accessdate=19 Feb 2015|newspaper=New York Times|date=26 Aug 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===World War II Ireland===
During World War II, Ireland remained mostly uninvolved in the war that swept through most the rest of Europe, known only as "the Emergency" in Ireland.&lt;ref name=ThatIsOnlyWar&gt;{{cite news|last=Richardson|first=Caleb|title=That is only war: Irish writers and the emergency|journal=UMI Dissertations Publishing|year=2006|pages=2–4|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304978789}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Taking a "neutral" stance in the war, Ireland did not engage directly in the war on either side and declined to make any kind of established allegiance to the Axis or Allied powers.  As a result, Ireland experienced a period of isolation from the rest of the Western world, with few Irishmen travelling abroad and few foreigners travelling to Ireland.  This period of isolation set in motion a period of criticism and questioning of the fledgling country's national identity and ideals, with various factions unhappy with the status quo in the island nation.   Some of the primary concerns for those unsatisfied with the state of the Ireland at the time included a government unconcerned with the republican ideals the nation was created with, widespread poverty in Ireland, and a general inability for the nation to be a major player on the world stage capable of defending itself.  With these concerns and isolation, the Irish people sought to question the direction Ireland was headed in.  And in this war period and the time that immediately followed, Ireland and its artists also sought to question what constituted "Irish art" and how that would impact Irish identity.&lt;ref name=ThatIsOnlyWar /&gt;

===Art In Ireland===
Art in Ireland during the 1930s and 1940s still primarily consisted of traditional representational art.  Championed by the Royal Hibernian Academy and the National College of Art, this traditionalist art remained the favored style of visual artistic creation following the Emergency period.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the this sentence and the previous one|date=April 2015}} Many Irish artists rejected the established institutions and sought philosophical inspiration from other fields, particularly that of literature.&lt;ref name=TheEmergency /&gt; Although it was not until the late 1930s that the character of Irish art was to be seriously challenged as Irish artists began seeking an Irish artistic identity.  With artists like Mainie Jellett leading the way, artists of Ireland, who more frequently received no formal education due to some of the institutions more restrictive policies, found an outlet to challenge the traditionalist movements in Ireland through organizations like the IELA.&lt;ref name=TheEmergency&gt;{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Roisin|title=The emergency: a turning point for Irish art?|journal=Circa|year=2000|pages=1–2|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1320756901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the opening of the IELA, only one major exhibition took place each year in Dublin, which was the Annual Exhibition of the Royal Hibernian Academy.  The RHA, and other major art institutions in Ireland at this time, supported art that accurately portrayed reality.&lt;ref name=LivingArt&gt;{{cite news|last=Coleman|first=John|title=A Painter of Living Art: Jack P. Hanlon 1913-1968|journal=|year=1988|pages=222|doi=10.2307/20492069}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And while the established art forums favored traditional representational art, there was some push back from groups of artists in favor of modernist art.  One of the most well-known of these prior to the IELA was known as the [[White Stag Group]] which was formed in the late 1930s.  The White Stag Group, formed by Kenneth Hall and Basil Rakoczi, had middle-class English roots that eventually took hold in Dublin and the rest of Ireland. It wasn't until organizations like the IELA and White Stag Group came about that non-traditional Irish art had a means of being displayed in a way that was accessible and popular.&lt;ref name=Stag&gt;{{cite book|last=Keown, Edwina|first=and Carol Taaffe|title=Irish Modernism|publisher=Peter Lang AG, International Publishers|pages=181–182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iu5qMGrr3QcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the IELA==
The IELA was formed in 1943 after a group of middle-class artists in Ireland sought to oppose the traditional hegemony created by the [[Royal Hibernian Academy]] (RHA) and the National College of Art in Ireland.  Artists in this group included [[Norah McGuinness]], [[Mainie Jellett]], [[Evie Hone]], Fr. [[Jack Hanlon (Priest and Painter)|Jack Hanlon]] and [[Louis le Brocquy]], among others.&lt;ref name=IELAbio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/societies/irish-exhibition-living-art|title=Irish Exhibition of Living Art|work=British and Irish Artists of the 20th Century|publisher=Artist Biographies|accessdate=19 Feb 2014|ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While not all of them subscribed completely to the modernism of the rest of western Europe and the United States, these artists did seek to stray off the path established by Irish art institutions.  Many artists that founded the IELA were influenced by the dissenting Impressionist art circles in Paris who broke away from the French Academy.  Even though they understood this may cause friction with established institutions in Ireland, many of the founders saw the French as an example to be followed.  However, many artists managed to form a delicate balance, seeing as artists who displayed their work in the IELA also displayed pieces through the other traditional institutions such as the RHA.  Nonetheless, the IELA's main goal was to provide a forum for artists who sought to reshape the Irish artistic landscape and provided them the means through which to do that.&lt;ref name=LivingArt /&gt;

The beginnings of the IELA can be traced to an open criticism of the RHA by Jellett which ultimately led to other modernist artists like le Brocquy having their works rejected for exhibitions hosted annually by the RHA.  In response to this, Jellett and other modernist artists established the IELA to create a forum to display the work of artists regardless of what school or style they subscribed to.  Reviews of the IELA's first show in 1943 indicated the division in the art world over artistic identity and creativity.&lt;ref name=IELAhist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/irish-exhibition-of-living-art.htm|title=Irish Exhibition of Living Art (IELA) (1943-1980s)|work=Irish Exhibition of Living Art|publisher=History and Foundation of the IELA|accessdate=19 Feb 2014|ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some instances, this division was deeply entrenched, especially in the National College of Art, which was opposed to modernist movements for some time.  However, this opposition was not felt as strongly in every established institution in the country.  Even though steadfastness for traditional art was common, much of the art world in Ireland remained fairly well connected and eased their opposition to the tide of modernism coming from continent-inspired artists.  Both the modernist and traditionalist camps had their work displayed by the same institutions in some instances.  Ultimately, this coexistence allowed for institutions like IELA to be friendly with organizations such as the RHA, without which the IELA would have no traction in the Dublin art world.&lt;ref name=IELAhist /&gt;

Not only did the IELA seek to break from the traditional norms of Irish art, it was displayed some progressive trends for its time, whether intentionally or otherwise.  For example, women artists played a critical role in the formation and establishment of the IELA.  The first two presidents of the Exhibition, Mainie Jellett and Norah McGuinness, were women who held the position during the formative years of the Exhibition.  Jellett, who served as the president before her death in 1944, played a key role in its formation, and McGuinness, who served for over 20 years after its foundation, played a critical role in maintaining the direction that the IELA stood for.&lt;ref name=WomenArtists&gt;{{cite news|last=Mayes, Elizabeth, Jeni Rogers, Wanda Ryan-Smolin|title=Irish Women Artists: From the 18th Century to the Present Day|journal=|year=1990|pages=45–49|jstor=1358389}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the decades following its conception, the IELA became a fixture in the Irish art world.  However, while they did become established, they did not allow themselves to lose sight of the founding principles of the institution.  True to the spirit of the IELA, the original management stepped down and handed off the Exhibition to a younger generation of artists in 1972.  The IELA continued to influence young artists well into the future.&lt;ref name=HistofIreland&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=J.

To this day, the IELA remains a showcase for contemporary art and has since expanded to include other art forms such as performance, video, and installation art.&lt;ref name=IELAhist /&gt;  The IELA has played an enormous role in developing the Irish art scene and providing an outlet through which the artists of Ireland can display their works while also challenging the norm in Irish art, even being called a part of the "birth of Modernism in the visual arts in Ireland."&lt;ref name=IrishTimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Lilliput|first=Dorothy|title=Knowing the difference Brian Kennedy welcomes a 'splendid' history of Irish modern art|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&amp;csi=142626&amp;sr=HLEAD(Knowing%20the%20difference%20Brian%20Kennedy%20welcomes%20a%20%60splendid%20history%20of%20Irish%20modern%20art)%20and%20date%20is%201998|accessdate=19 Feb 2015|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=10 Jan 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Exhibition even expanded to include postmodernist art to expose both the public and artists alike to new developing styles.&lt;ref name=IELAhist /&gt;

The '''''Lamentation over the Dead Christ'''''  is a painting of the common subject of the [[Lamentation of Christ]] by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Pietro Perugino]], executed in 1495 and now in the [[Galleria Palatina]] of [[Palazzo Pitti]], [[Florence]], Italy.

==History==
The painting was commissioned by the [[Poor Clares]] of the convent of Santa Chiara in Florence. Highly admired by its contemporaries, the work inspired other paintings such as [[Fra Bartolomeo]]'s ''Pietà'' and [[Andrea del Sarto]]'s ''Luco Pietà'', both in the same collection.
[[File:Pietro Perugino 012.jpg|left|thumb|Detail of Joseph of Arimatea.]]
During the [[Napoleonic invasion of Italy]], it was transferred to [[Paris]] (1799), where it remained until 1814. Initially  housed at the [[Accademia delle Belle Arti di Firenze|Gallerie dell'Accademia]], it was moved to Palazzo Pitti in 1834.

==Description==
The work is emblematic of Perugino's style, due to the presence of numerous figures and attitudes, creating a calm scene of contemplation, in order to ease a religious contemplation without renouncing to a sense of harmony and beauty.&lt;ref name ="GaribaldiV"&gt;{{cite book|first=Vittoria|last= Garibaldi|chapter=Perugino|title=Pittori del Rinascimento|publisher=Scala|location=Florence|year= 2004|isbn= 888117099X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a hilly background with a lake and a fortified city, is the scene of the Lamentation, which occupies the foreground of lower half of the painting.   The body of Jesus is at the center, lying over a white shroud and held by one of the Pious Women, by Nicodemus and by [[Joseph of Arimathea]]. The latter dons a  richly decorated hat with flowers.

The Virgin is holding one of Jesus's arms, looking at him pathetically. In the middle is [[Mary Magdalene]], with brilliant red clothes, forming one of the three vertexes of an ideal triangle, the others being Joseph and Nicodemus. At the sides are two groups of figures: on the left, John the Apostle and a Pious Woman, on the right three men who are discussing amongst them.

'''''Noise: The Political Economy of Music''''' is a non-fiction book by French economist and scholar, [[Jacques Attali]].

Attali's essential argument in ''Noise: The Political Economy of Music'' (French title: ''Bruits: essai sur l'economie politique de la musique'') is that music, as a cultural form, is intimately tied up in the mode of production in any given society. For [[Marxism|Marxist]] critics, this idea is nothing new. The novelty of Attali's work is that it reverses the traditional understandings about how revolutions in the mode of production take place:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[Attali] is the first to point out the other possible logical consequence of the “reciprocal interaction” model—namely, the possibility of a superstructure to anticipate historical developments, to foreshadow new social formations in a prophetic and annunciatory way. The argument of ''Noise'' is that music, unique among the arts for reasons that are themselves overdetermined, has precisely this annunciatory vocation; that the music of today stands both as a promise of a new, liberating mode of production, and as the menace of a [[dystopia]]n possibility which is that mode of production’s baleful mirror image."&lt;ref&gt;Fredric Jameson, from the "Foreword" to ''Noise''&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Attali's Four Stages of Music==
Attali believes that music has gone through four distinct cultural stages in its history: ''Sacrificing'', ''Representing'', ''Repeating'', and a fourth cultural stage which could roughly be called ''Post-Repeating''. These stages are each linked to a certain "mode of production"; that is to say, each of these stages carries with it a certain set of technologies for producing, recording and disseminating music, and also concomitant cultural structures that allow for music's transmission and reception.

'''Sacrificing''' refers to the pre-history of modern music—the period of purely oral tradition. In historical terms, this period could be dated to anytime before about 1500 AD. This is the period before mass-produced, notated music—a period when the musical tradition exists solely in the memory of people, generally in the form of oral songs and folktales. Here, Attali characterizes music as being contrasted to the "noise" of nature—of death, chaos and destruction. In other words, music stands in contrast to all of those natural forces that threaten man and his cultural heritage. The purpose of music in this era is to preserve and transmit that cultural heritage, by using music to reinforce memory. Music in this period is ubiquitous and often tied up in festival. He calls the chapter '''Sacrificing''' because in this era, music is a ritualized, structuralized sublimation of the violence of nature.

'''Representing''' refers to the era of printed music—roughly 1500-1900 AD. During this era, music becomes tied to a physical medium for the first time, and therefore becomes a commodity for sale in the marketplace. During this era, Attali characterizes music as being a spectacle that is contrasted to silence—think of the hushed anticipation that greets the professional performer in the concert hall. During this era, music also becomes separated from the human life-world: no longer the purview of peasants at their labor, music becomes a highly complex, mechanical process that is articulated by specialists. He calls this chapter '''Representing''' because the project of the performer is to "re-present" music—to bring it out of absence and into presence by drawing the intent of the composer from the page and articulating it to a waiting audience:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Beginning in the eighteenth century, ritualized belonging became representation. The musician… became a producer and seller of signs who was free in appearance, but in fact almost always exploited and manipulated by his clients…''
The attitude of music then changed profoundly: in ritual, it was one element in the totality of life… In contrast, in representation there was a gulf between the musicians and the audience; the most perfect silence reigned in the concerts of the bourgeoisie… The trap closed: the silence greeting the musicians was what created music and gave it autonomous existence, a reality. Instead of being a relation, it was no longer anything more than a monologue of specialists competing in front of consumers. The artist was born, at the same time that his work went on sale…" (Attali, 46-47) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Repeating''' refers to the era of recorded and broadcast sound—roughly 1900 AD-present. During this period, notation (which could be thought of as a highly coded, written guide to how music should be sounded) was replaced by recording (which is the sounding of music, trapped and preserved on vinyl, tape or disc). During this era, Attali asserts that the goal of music is not memory or quality, but fidelity—the goal of those engaged in the musical project (which includes not only composers and performers, but sound engineers, studio execs and the like) is to record sound as clearly and flawlessly as possible, and to perfectly reproduce these recordings. In this era, each musical work is contrasted to the other versions of itself—the key question for the musician becomes: how faithfully can he re-produce the "original" recording? Attali calls this chapter '''Repeating''', then, because each musical act is a repetition of what came before: music is made up of ever-more-perfect echoes of itself:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The advent of recording thoroughly shattered representation. First produced as a way of preserving its trace, it instead replaced it as the driving force of the economy of music… for those trapped by the record, public performance becomes a simulacrum of the record: an audience generally familiar with the artist’s recordings attends to hear a live replication… For popular music, this has meant the gradual death of small bands, who have been reduced to faithful imitations of recording stars. For the classical repertory, it means the danger… of imposing all of the aesthetic criteria of repetition—made of rigor and cold calculation—upon representation." (Attali, 85) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also important to '''Repeating''' are Attali’s ideas of Exchange-Time and Use-Time.  Attali defines Exchange-Time as the time spent towards earning the money needed to purchase a recording, whereas Use-Time involves the time spent listening to recordings by the purchaser.  In a society made up of recording labels and radio stations, far more recordings are produced than an individual can listen to in a lifetime, and in an effort to spend more time in Use-Time than in Exchange-Time people begin to stockpile recordings of what they want to hear.  Attali states that this stockpiling has become the main method of use by consumers, and in doing so, shorter musical works have been valorized.  More importantly, according to Attali, this process of stockpiling removes the social and political power from music. (Attali, 101)

Attali hints at a '''Post-Repeating''' era in his chapter 'Composing', but never fully develops his theory of it. While many readers consider this to be influenced by electronic musical techniques such as [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampling]], [[remix]]ing and electronic manipulation (which were common in 1985 when the English translation was published), it is doubtful that they would have influenced Attali given that "Noise" was first published in French in 1977 (and one can assume the manuscript was completed at least several months prior to publication).

It has been in use for over 5 decades. There are both positive and negative uses of the phrase.

==History of the phrase==
The term ''"one size fits all"'' has been used as a common, cliche phrase for over 5 decades. It was already a popular term, in 1975, when [[Frank Zappa]] recorded the album ''[[One Size Fits All (Frank Zappa album)|One Size Fits All]]''.&lt;ref name="lnk"&gt;For source references, refer to each nearby linked article.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positive views of the phrase==
There are several positive views of the phrase ''"one size fits all"'':

:* A [[wristwatch]] could be considered as fitting all people.&lt;ref name=lnk/&gt;
:* In women's clothing, a flexible or open garment can be labeled as one-size-fits-all; however, the size is typically a medium size (able to expand), rather than actually fitting petite or extra-large (XL) sizes.
:* A neck chain could be designed to be worn by men or women.
:* [[Bicycle helmet]]s with ring fit systems allow for a single size, also known as [[universal fit]].&lt;ref name=lnk/&gt;&lt;ref name="bhsi"&gt;
  "One Size Fits All Bicycle Helmets", BHSI, April 2009,
  web: [http://www.bhsi.org/onesize.htm BHSI-onesiz].&lt;/ref&gt;
:* In military gear, some items have just one size (but smaller or larger people have already been excluded from military service).
:* Many baseball hats available for commercial purchase are labeled "one-size-fits-all"

==Negative views of the phrase==
There are many negative views of the phrase ''"one size fits all"'' including:
:* Many customers prefer to have custom-tailored clothing.
:* Men's [[Suit (clothing)|dress suit]]s typically have specific sizes for chest &amp; waist measurements.&lt;ref name=lnk/&gt;
:* [[Shoes]] are an example where sizes (and widths) vary depending on the specific person.&lt;ref name=lnk/&gt;
:* For the [[United States|U.S.]] [[GI Bill]] in education, options and coverage will vary depending on each person.&lt;ref name=lnk/&gt;

Politically, the phrase has come to mean that methods of administration or political beliefs in one country should not necessarily be applied to another.

'''Padraic Colum''' (8 December 1881 – 11 January 1972) was an Irish poet, novelist, dramatist, biographer, playwright, children's author and [[folklore|collector of folklore]]. He was one of the leading figures of the [[Irish Literary Revival]].

==Early life==
[[File:Padraic Colum in the 1900s.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Portrait drawing of Colum by [[John Butler Yeats|John B. Yeats]], 1900s]]

Colum was born '''Patrick Columb''' in a [[County Longford]] workhouse, where his father worked. He was the first of eight children born to Patrick and Susan Columb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=30 April 2012 4:17:03 AM #.26# |url=http://www.poemhunter.com/padraic-colum |title=Biodata |publisher=Poemhunter.com |accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the father lost his job in 1889, he moved to the United States to participate in the [[Colorado gold rush]]. Padraic and his mother and siblings remained in Ireland. When the father returned in 1892, the family moved to [[Glasthule]], near [[Dublin]], where his father was employed as Assistant Manager at [[Sandycove and Glasthule railway station]]. His son attended the local [[National school (Ireland)|national school]].

When Susan Columb died in 1897, the family was temporarily split up. Padraic (as he would be known) and one brother remained in Dublin, while their father and remaining children moved back to Longford. Colum finished school the following year and at the age of seventeen, he passed an exam for and was awarded a clerkship in the [[Irish Railway Clearing House]]. He stayed in this job until 1903.

During this period, Colum started to write and met a number of the leading Irish writers of the time, including [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Lady Gregory]] and [[George William Russell|Æ]]. He also joined the [[Gaelic League]] and was a member of the first board of the [[Abbey Theatre]]. He became a regular user of the [[National Library of Ireland]], where he met [[James Joyce]] and the two became lifelong friends. During the riots caused by the Abbey Theatre's production of ''[[The Playboy of the Western World]]'', Padraic Colum's father, Patrick Columb, was one of the protestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/synge-s-opening-night-to-remember-1.1291816|title=Synge's opening night to remember|newspaper=The Irish Times|access-date=2017-02-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Padraic himself was not engaged in the protests, although he did pay his father's fine afterwards.

He collected Irish folk songs, and sometimes rewrote them almost in their entirety, including the famous ''[[She Moved Through the Fair]]''. Colum based his poem on one surviving line, while his collaborator, the musicologist [[Herbert Hughes (musicologist)|Herbert Hughes]] noted the tune.&lt;ref&gt;"SHE MOVED THROUGH THE FAIR". (9 April 1970). ''The Irish Times''&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a five-year scholarship by a wealthy American benefactor, Thomas Hughes Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bc.edu/libraries/newsletter/2014spring/colum.html|title=Boston College Libraries Newsletter - Spring 2014|last=chrishp|website=www.bc.edu|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used it to read, study and write. He did not attend University College Dublin, or any other University as a student.

==Early poetry and plays==
He was awarded a prize by [[Cumann na nGaedheal (1900)|Cumann na nGaedheal]] for his anti-enlistment play, ''The Saxon Shillin'''. Through his plays he became involved with the National Theatre Society and became involved in the founding of the [[Abbey Theatre]], writing several of its early productions. His first play, ''Broken Soil'' (revised as The Fiddler's House) (1903) was performed by [[W. G. Fay's Irish National Dramatic Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Fay: The Fays of the Abbey Theatre. 1935. p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Land'' (1905), was one of that theatre's first great public successes. He wrote another important play for the Abbey named ''Thomas Muskerry'' (1910).

His earliest published poems appeared in ''The United Irishman'', a paper edited by [[Arthur Griffith]]. His first book, ''Wild Earth'' (1907) collected many of these poems and was dedicated to Æ. He published several poems in [[Arthur Griffith]]'s paper, ''[[The United Irishman]]'' this time, with ''The Poor Scholar'' bringing him to the attention of [[William Butler Yeats|WB Yeats]]. He became a friend of Yeats and [[Augusta, Lady Gregory|Lady Gregory]].  In 1908, he wrote an introduction to the [[Everyman's Library]] edition of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]''.

In 1911, with [[Mary Colum|Mary Gunning Maguire]], a student from UCD, and David Houston and [[Thomas MacDonagh]], he founded the short-lived literary journal ''The Irish Review'', which published work by Yeats, [[George A. Moore|George Moore]], [[Oliver St John Gogarty]], and many other leading Revival figures.

In 1912 he married Maguire. Padraic taught at [[Pádraig Pearse]]'s experimental school, [[St. Enda's School|Scoil Éanna]] in Rathfarnham, County Dublin and Mary Maguire taught at the girls' school, Scoil Íde or St. Ita's, which was set up in Cullenswood House, Ranelagh, Dublin, once Scoil Éanna had moved to Rathfarnham.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://limerick100.wordpress.com/2014/10/16/i-care-not-if-my-life-has-only-the-span-of-a-night-and-a-day-if-my-deeds-be-spoken-of-by-the-men-of-ireland-padraic-colums-thoughts-on-pearse-and-macdonagh-1916/|title=Spotlight: Padraic Colum’s thoughts on Pearse and MacDonagh (1916)|last=@Limerick1914 in Art, Education, Politics, Religion, Spotlight|first=|date=16 October 2014|website=History is what we choose to remember Researching Limerick 100 years ago, Slavery, Memory, Power|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first the couple lived in the Dublin suburb of [[Donnybrook, Dublin|Donnybrook]], where they held a regular Tuesday literary salon. They then moved to [[Howth]], a small fishing village just to the north of the capital. In 1914, they travelled to the US for what was intended to be a visit of a few months but lasted most the rest of their lives.

==Later life and work==
In America, Colum took up children's writing and published a number of collections of stories for children, beginning with ''[[The King of Ireland's Son]]'' (1916). This book came about when Colum started translating an Irish folk tale from [[Irish language|Gaelic]] because he did not want to forget the language. After it was published in the [[New York Tribune]], Hungarian Illustrator [[Willy Pogany]] suggested the possibility of a book collaboration, so Colum wove the folktale into a long, epic story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Critical History of Children's Literature |last=Viguers |first=Ruth Hill |authorlink= |author2=Cornelia Meigs (ed.) |year=1969 |publisher=Macmillan Publishing co. |location= |isbn=0-02-583900-4 |page=426 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of his books for children were awarded retrospective citations for the [[Newbery Honor]]. A contract for children's literature with [[Macmillan Publishers]] made him financially secure for the rest of his life. Some other books he wrote are ''The Adventure of Odysseus'' (1918) and ''The Children of Odin'' (1920). These works are important for bringing classical literature to children.

In 1922 he was commissioned to write versions of Hawaiian folklore for young people. This resulted in the publication of three volumes of his versions of tales from the islands. At the suggestion of Dr Pádraic Whyte (School of English, Trinity College Dublin) a first edition of the first volume (''At the Gateways of the Day'') was presented to US president Barack Obama by Taoiseach Enda Kenny on the occasion of his visit to Dublin, Ireland on 23 May 2011.&lt;ref name="IT28May2011"&gt;{{cite web

The Colums spent the years from 1930 to 1933 living in Paris and [[Nice]], where Padraic renewed his friendship with [[James Joyce]] and became involved in the transcription of ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.

After their time in France, the couple moved to New York City, where they did some teaching at [[Columbia University]] and [[CCNY]]. Colum was a prolific author and published a total of 61 books, not counting his plays. He adopted the form of [[Noh]] drama in his later plays.

While in New York, he wrote the screenplay for the 1954 stop-motion animated film [[Hansel and Gretel: An Opera Fantasy|Hansel and Gretel]].  It was his only screenplay. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0173365/&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary died in 1957 and Padraic finished ''Our Friend James Joyce'', which they had worked on together. It was published in 1958. Colum divided his later years between the United States and Ireland. In 1961 the Catholic Library Association awarded him the [[Regina Medal]]. He died in [[Enfield, Connecticut]], age 90, and was buried in [[St. Fintan's Cemetery, Sutton]].

In 1965, Colum sold the notebooks, manuscripts, galley proofs, and letters that were in his apartments in New York and Dublin to the [[Binghamton University|Binghamton University Libraries]].  He wished to make whatever resources he could available to scholars of Irish literature and history.&lt;ref&gt;http://slipknot.binghamton.edu/?p=collections/findingaid&amp;id=5746&amp;q=&amp;rootcontentid=38960&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked how to say his name, he told ''The [[Literary Digest]]'' the last name was the same as the word ''column''. "In my first name, the first ''a'' has the sound of ''au''.  The ordinary pronunciation in Irish is ''pau'drig''."&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Earle Funk]], ''What's the Name, Please?'', Funk &amp; Wagnalls, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect-multi|2|Cacophony|Euphony}}

'''Phonaesthetics''' (from the {{lang-grc-gre|φωνή}} ''phōnē'', "voice-sound"; and {{lang-grc-gre|αἰσθητική}} ''aisthētikē'', "aesthetics") is the philosophical study of beauty ([[aesthetics]]) within the sounds of human speech ([[phonetics]]), or the scientific study of perceptions about beauty in such sounds. The term is not formally established in either philosophy or linguistics. According to Irish linguist Raymond Hickey, phonaesthetics is concerned with  "the possible connection between sound sequences and meaning"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hickey |first1=Raymond |title=A Dictionary of Varieties of English |date=2013 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=111858404X |page=514 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kWpXAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT514 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly through [[sound symbolism]], and according to British linguist [[David Crystal]], it is "a term sometimes used in linguistics to refer to the study of the aesthetic properties of sound".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crystal |first1=David |title=Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics |date=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781444356755 |page=364 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZPQVuSgDAkC&amp;pg=PT364 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Crystal: 

{{quote|Examples include the implication of smallness in the [[close vowel]]s of such words as ''teeny weeny'', and the unpleasant associations of the consonant cluster ''sl-'' in such words as ''slime'', ''slug'', and ''slush''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crystal|first1=David|title=A Dictionary of Language|date=2001 |publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226122038|page=260|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3GU5FWs1pBEC&amp;pg=PA260|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}The application of said aesthetic properties of sound, phonaesthetics, and their meaning in [[Media (communication)|media]] has yet to be studied extensively. That being said, the study of sound [[aesthetics]] is a burgeoning field waiting to be studied by phonaestheticians everywhere.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Sound has many qualitative aspects, some of which are subjectively regarded as euphony and cacophony.

== Euphony ==
Euphony is the effect of sounds being pleasant, rhythmical, or harmonious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_C.html|title=CACOPHONY, Literary Terms and Definition by Carson-Newman University|date=|accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://literarydevices.net/cacophony/|title=Definition of Cacophony|date=|accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ElizabethPodhaizer2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elizabeth|first1=Mary|last2=Podhaizer|first2=Mary Elizabeth|title=Painless Poetry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PL-Lpq-BbucC&amp;pg=RA1-PT186|year=2001|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|isbn=978-0-7641-1614-8|chapter=Euphony}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of euphony is the poem ''Some Sweet Day''.

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Some day Love shall claim his own
Some day Right ascend his throne,
Some day hidden Truth be known;
Some day—some sweet day.
&lt;/poem&gt;|"Some Sweet Day", [[Lewis J. Bates]]}}{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

== Cacophony ==
Cacophony is the effect of sounds being harsh and often discordant. These sounds are often meaningless and jumbled together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cacophony|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cacophony?s=t|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A discordant series of harsh, unpleasant sounds helps to convey disorder. This is often furthered by the combined effect of the meaning and the difficulty of pronunciation. For example:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;My stick fingers click with a snicker
And, chuckling, they knuckle the keys;
Light-footed, my steel feelers flicker
And pluck from these keys melodies.&lt;/poem&gt;
|"Player Piano", [[John Updike]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetic Devices|url=http://www.chaparralpoets.org/devices.pdf|website=chaparralpoets.org|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Piano Trio No. 2  in E minor''', for violin, cello and piano, Op. 67, by [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] was written in 1944, in the midst of World War II.

==Composition history==
The composition was dedicated to Shostakovich's good friend, [[Ivan Sollertinsky]], a Russian [[polymath]] and avid musician, who had recently died at age 41.  The work received its premiere in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] on 14 November 1944.  The piece consists of four movements, with a complete performance running 25 to 27 minutes.

==Structure==
# Andante -- Highly dissonant, it begins with an extremely difficult passage in the cello, all [[harmonics]]. The rest of the movement starts with canonic material, but then develops into a sonata form, requiring incredible amounts of technical prowess from all three instruments
# Allegro con brio -- A frenzied dance that never finds a settling place
# Largo -- Against a repeated background of piano chords, the violin and cello trade off dark, slow, and somber melodic lines. It fades into the last movement with hardly a break.
# Allegretto -- Staccato repeated notes begin this "Dance of Death" movement, which introduces a [[Jewish]]-style melody, and revisits the thematic content of the previous three movements. It ends in a tortured E Major chord, almost inaudibly.

The Jewish melody from the last movement was quoted in Shostakovich's famous [[String Quartet No. 8 (Shostakovich)|String Quartet No. 8]]. The third movement is featured in choreographer [[John Neumeier]]'s ballet "The Seagull" (Hamburg, 2002).

'''The Roux Family''' of [[Marseilles]] was a family of [[hydrographer]]s and [[marine painter]]s that specialized in ship [[portraits]].  While many generations were involved in the hydrographic business, it was really only three generations who painted and became known for their skill and accuracy in portraying a ship, making their work seem more like a photograph than a painting.&lt;ref&gt;Gulliver (1930), pp. 121-122&lt;/ref&gt;  The painters in the family were Joseph, Ange-Joseph [[Antoine Roux|Antoine]], Mathieu-Antoine, Ursule-Josephine, François Joseph Frédéric and François Geoffroi.

==Joseph Roux==
Joseph Roux was born in 1725 in Marseille, France to Joseph Roux, who worked as a hydrographer, and Magdaleine Senequier.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1978), family tree&lt;/ref&gt;  He took over the family business and became a hydrographer like his father, “in the course of which he published, manufactured, and sold a wide assortment of charts, [[Navigational instrument|navigating instruments]], and related nautical gear.”&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1978), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  It was probably around the mid-18th century when Joseph earned the title of “Hydrographe du Roi” meaning Hydrographer to the King.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1978), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1764, Joseph published a folio of twelve Mediterranean charts which were used for a number of years after their publication.  Copies were even used on [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']] in 1803 and 1805, as well as on [[HMS Shannon (1806)|HMS ''Shannon'']].&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1978), pp. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;  Joseph was also known to paint, though not as frequently as his son or grandchildren.  Two such works, oil paintings titled ''Bonhomme Richard vs Serapis'' and ''Naval Engagement between a British East Indiaman and a French Warship'', exist at the [[Peabody Essex Museum]] and showcase Joseph’s skill as a painter.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1978), pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;  Joseph died in 1793 in Marseille.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1978), family tree&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Ange-Joseph Antoine Roux==
[[Antoine Roux|Ange-Joseph Antoine Roux]], who went by “Antoine Roux”, was born March 5, 1765 in Marseille, France to Joseph Roux and Marie-Ursule Demoline.&lt;ref&gt;Ships and Shipping (1925), pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;  He grew up in his father’s hydrographic shop where he most likely picked up a great deal of nautical knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1978), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest known work by Antoine is a sketch from 1787, signed and dated, showing pieces of a [[man-of-war]].  Later [[sketchbook]]s are in the collection at the Peabody Essex Museum. Antoine became famous for his ship portraits and shipowners and captains were eager to entrust him with the task of creating paintings for their ships.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1978), pp. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;  He became very popular for the accuracy in his ship portraits and the way he made them seem alive.&lt;ref&gt;Gulliver (1930), pp. 121-122&lt;/ref&gt;

For the most part Antoine’s style remained the same, especially when it came to hulls and rigging, which he depicted with excellent skill.  One area that changed was his depiction of water.  It was around 1805-1806 that he stopped illustrating waves so formally with high-crested wavelets, except in the instance of rough seas, and replaced them with softer and more natural looking waves.  There was also a discernible pattern in regards to his signature:

1790s-1802     “fait par Ante [or “Antne”] Roux"

1801-1830     “Ante [or “Antne”] Roux à Marseille"

1825-1835     “Ante [or Antne”] Roux père à Marseille"

Antoine died April 20, 1835 from Cholera.  He continued to paint and work in the hydrographic shop up until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Ships and Shipping (1925), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathieu-Antoine Roux==
Mathieu-Antoine Roux, who like his father went by “Antoine Roux”, was born in Marseille, France on May 20, 1799 to the elder Antoine and Rose Elizabeth Gabrielle Catelin.  He would be the first of four children to the couple.  Antoine also became a painter, although he is not considered to be quite as skilled as his brothers or father were.  He ended up taking over the hydrographic business of an uncle only a short distance from the one his father ran.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1978), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ships and Shipping (1925), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;  He used the same image his grandfather had introduced in his hydrographic shop and that became associated with the Roux family, that of the two little men, one using a [[telescope]] and the other using an [[Octant (instrument)|octant]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1978), pp. 1-2, 33&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon Antoine’s death on January 26, 1872, his son François Antoine Roux, nicknamed “Tonin”, took over the hydrographic shop.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1978), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;  To distinguish his paintings from those of his father, Antoine’s signatures were very clear.  He often signed “Ante Roux fils ainé”, which can be translated as “Antoine Roux eldest son”.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1978), pp. 35-36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Google Translate&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ursule-Josephine Roux==
Ursule Josephine was the second child of Antoine and Rose; born in 1801 in Marseille.  Very little is known about her and she did not paint nearly as frequently as her brothers.  One painting, titled ''View of Marseille Harbor'' is owned by the Peabody Essex Museum.  As of 1924, two others were privately owned by a gentleman named Edouard Gaubert, who knew the family.  They are titled ''L’Entrée du Port de Marseille'' and La ''Calanque de l’Ourse''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1978), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==François Joseph Frédéric Roux==
François Joseph Frédéric, who went by Frédéric, was the third child of Antoine and Rose and was born in 1805 in Marseille.  Frédéric was already painting for money at the age of 17 in 1822, clearly showing a great skill for his craft.  As a young man, Frédéric went to [[Paris]] at the insistence of [[Carle Vernet|Carle]] and [[Horace Vernet]] (son and grandson of [[Joseph Vernet]]) to study at the Vernet studio.  It was in Paris where he was commissioned by [[Jean-Baptiste Philibert Willaumez|Admiral Jean-Baptiste Philibert Wilaumez]] to create 40 watercolors of the vessels on which he had served or been involved with.  This set is now in the [[Musée de la Marine]] in Paris.  Frédéric was also commissioned to make 23 watercolors dedicated to the [[Duke of Orléans|Duc d’Orléans]], [[Prince Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans|Ferdinand Philippe]], which were finished in 1831. It was around 1835 that Frédéric moved from Paris to [[Le Havre|Havre]] where he set up a hydrographic shop and painting business.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1978), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Frédéric did not solely devote himself to the hydrographic and painting business, but instead divided his time with adventures, traveling and generally enjoying the pleasures life had to offer.  He ventured a few times back to Marseilles, but spent the rest of his life in Havre, where he died in January 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1978), pp. 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;

==François Geoffroi Roux==
François Geoffroi, who went by François, was the fourth child of Antoine and Rose and was born on October 21, 1811 in Marseille.  His talent brought him the attention of Carle and Horace Vernet, as it had his brother Frédéric, but he did not leave for Paris as his brother did.  He stayed in Marseille where he eventually took over his father’s hydrographic shop.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1978), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;  François became famous for his skill in portraying a ship naturally, to almost make it appear as though one were looking at a photograph of a ship rather than a painting.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1978), pp. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;  He was so skilled that it was said that François had “assimilated the science of the ship as if he were both builder and sailor.”&lt;ref&gt;Ships and Shipping (1925), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  Of particular interest was a series of watercolors he created between the late 1860s and 1882 that illustrated the “development of naval and merchant vessels since the last decade of the eighteenth century.”&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1978), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  These were given to the [[Louvre]], but not all made it and so an exact count of how many were created is unknown.  The Musée de la Marine currently owns 71.  François died in Marseille on September 30, 1882.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1978), pp. 61-62&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kepler-solar-system-2.png|thumb|upright|Inner section of Kepler's [[Platonic solid]] model of planetary spacing in the [[Solar System]] from ''[[Mysterium Cosmographicum]]'' (1596)]]

'''Sacred geometry''' ascribes symbolic and [[Sacred|sacred meanings]] to certain geometric shapes and certain geometric [[Proportion (architecture)|proportions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit5/unit5.html dartmouth.edu: Paul Calter, ''Polygons, Tilings, &amp; Sacred Geometry'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with the belief that a god is the geometer of the world. The geometry used in the design and construction of [[sacred architecture|religious structures]] such as [[Church (building)|churches]], [[temple]]s, [[mosque]]s, religious [[monuments]], [[altar]]s, and [[church tabernacle|tabernacles]] has sometimes been considered sacred. The concept applies also to sacred spaces such as [[temenos|temenoi]], [[sacred grove]]s, [[village green]]s and [[holy well]]s, and the creation of [[sacred art|religious art]].

==As worldview and cosmology==
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

The belief that a god created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins. [[Plutarch]] attributed the belief to [[Plato]], writing that "Plato said god geometrizes continually" (''Convivialium disputationum'', liber 8,2). In modern times, the mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] adapted this quote, saying "God arithmetizes".&lt;ref&gt;Cathérine Goldstein, Norbert Schappacher, Joachim Schwermer, ''The shaping of arithmetic'',  [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUFTcOsMTysC&amp;pg=PA235 p. 235].&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as [[Johannes Kepler]] (1571–1630), a belief in the geometric underpinnings of the cosmos persisted among some scientists.&lt;ref name=Calter&gt;{{cite web |last1=Calter |first1=Paul |title=Celestial Themes in Art &amp; Architecture |url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit10/unit10.html |publisher=[[Dartmouth College]] |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural forms==
{{further|Patterns in nature}}

[[File:NautilusCutawayLogarithmicSpiral.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Nautilus]]'' shell's [[logarithm]]ic growth spiral]]

According to [[Stephen Skinner (author)|Stephen Skinner]], the study of sacred geometry has its roots in the study of nature, and the [[Fibonacci number|mathematical principles]] at work therein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Skinner |first=Stephen |title=Sacred Geometry: Deciphering the Code |publisher=Sterling |date=2009 |isbn=978-1-4027-6582-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[patterns in nature|forms observed in nature]] can be related to geometry; for example, the [[chambered nautilus]] grows at a constant rate and so its shell forms a [[logarithmic spiral]] to accommodate that growth without changing shape. Also, [[honeybee]]s construct hexagonal cells to hold their honey.  These and other correspondences are sometimes interpreted in terms of sacred geometry and considered to be further proof of the natural significance of geometric forms.

==Art and architecture==
{{further|Mathematics and architecture|Mathematics and art|Islamic geometric patterns}}

Geometric ratios, and geometric figures were often employed in the designs of ancient [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Egyptian]], ancient Indian, [[Architecture of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman architecture|Roman]] architecture. Medieval European cathedrals also incorporated symbolic geometry. Indian and Himalayan spiritual communities often constructed temples and [[fortification]]s on design plans of [[mandala]] and [[yantra]].

Many of the sacred geometry principles of the human body and of ancient architecture were compiled into the [[Vitruvian Man]] drawing by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. The latter drawing was itself based on the much older writings of the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]].

[[Islamic geometric patterns]] are well known too, which are used in the Qu'ran, Mosques and even in the caligraphies of personal names.

===In Hinduism===

[[File:Mandala.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Hindu]] [[Mandala|Maṇḍala]]]]

The [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamas]] are a collection of Sanskrit,&lt;ref name=Grimes&gt;Grimes, John A. (1996). ''A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English''. State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|9780791430682}}. LCCN 96012383. [https://books.google.com/books?id=eP5p0ev3nJEC]&lt;/ref&gt; Tamil, and [[Grantha script|Grantha]]&lt;ref name=NagalingamCh1&gt;Nagalingam, Pathmarajah (2009). ''The Religion of the Agamas''. Siddhanta Publications. [http://www.siddha.com.my/forum/religionoftheagamas/chapter1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; scriptures chiefly constituting the methods of temple construction and creation of idols, worship means of deities, philosophical doctrines, meditative practices, attainment of sixfold desires, and four kinds of yoga.&lt;ref name=Grimes/&gt;

Elaborate rules are laid out in the Agamas for Shilpa (the art of [[sculpture]]) describing the quality requirements of such matters as the places where temples are to be built, the kinds of image to be installed, the materials from which they are to be made, their dimensions, proportions, air circulation, and lighting in the temple complex. The [[Manasara]] and Silpasara are works that deal with these rules. The rituals of daily worship at the temple also follow rules laid out in the Agamas.

=== In European Religious Architecture ===
The construction of Medieval European cathedrals was often based on geometries intended to make the viewer see the world through mathematics, and through this understanding, gain a better understanding of the divine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Petersen|first=Toni|title=A(rt and) A(rchitecture) T(hesaurus)|date=2003|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.article.t000037|work=Oxford Art Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These churches frequently featured a [[Latin Cross]] floor-plan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=CUMMINGS|first=L.A.|title=A RECURRING GEOMETRICAL PATTERN IN THE EARLY RENAISSANCE IMAGINATION|date=1986|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-033986-3.50067-7|work=Symmetry|pages=981–997|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080339863|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the beginning of the Renaissance in Europe, views shifted to favor simple and regular geometries. The circle in particular became a central and symbolic shape for the base of buildings, as it represented the perfection of nature and the centrality of man's place in the universe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The use of the circle and other simple and symmetrical geometric shapes was solidified as a staple of Renaissance religious architecture in [[Leon Battista Alberti]]'s architectural treatise, which described the ideal church in terms of spiritual geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/981109542|title=Architectural principles in the age of humanism.|last=Rudolf.|first=Wittkower,|date=1998|publisher=Academy Editions|isbn=0471977632|oclc=981109542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unanchored geometry==
[[Stephen Skinner (author)|Stephen Skinner]] discusses the tendency of some writers to place a geometric diagram over virtually any image of a natural object or human created structure, find some lines intersecting the image and declare it based on sacred geometry. If the geometric diagram does not intersect major physical points in the image, the result is what Skinner calls "unanchored geometry".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CG0EeHGl_dQC&amp;pg=PA91 Stephen Skinner, ''Sacred geometry: deciphering the code'', p91]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1994">The '''Salon de la Sécession''' was an [[Avant-gardism|Avant-gardist]] art exhibition which was held in [[Luxembourg]] each year from 1927 to 1930. It was the main event of the Luxembourg Secession movement which had been founded in 1926 by a number of artists including [[Claus Cito]], [[Nico Klopp]], [[Joseph Kutter]] and [[Auguste Trémont]] who were unhappy with the academic approach of the [[Cercle artistique de Luxembourg]] and its support of Impressionism. Hoping to develop interest in [[Fauvism]] and [[Expressionism]], they had been inspired by similar but substantially earlier secessionist movements in [[Munich]] (1892), [[Vienna]] (1896) and [[Berlin]] (1897). The Luxembourg movement folded in 1930 following the reconciliation of the Secession movement and the Cercle artistique.&lt;ref&gt;"Sezession, Luxemburger", ''Luxemburger Lexikon'', Editions Guy Binsfeld, Luxembourg, 2006. {{De icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perrine Pouget, Alice de Lestrange, Jean-Paul Labourdette, Dominique Auzias: "Luxembourg", Petit Futé, 2008, p. 250 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Salon's first exhibition was held in Luxembourg's city hall in 1927. The participating artists were Claus Cito, Nico Klopp, Joseph Kutter, [[Jemp Michels]], [[Harry Rabinger]], [[Jean Schaak]], [[Jos Sünnen]], [[Jean-Joseph Thiry]] and Auguste Trémont.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onsstad.lu/index.php?id=242&amp;L=0&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bcat%5D=80&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1003&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=240&amp;cHash=1164358a19 Georgette Bisdorff, "Claus Cito, der Bildhauer aus Bascharage"], ''Ons stad'' No 60, 1999.

Panel at right is ''Death and the Miser''. At bottom "The Wayfarer" which  would have been on the outside of the triptych.]]

'''''Ship of Fools''''' (painted c. 1490–1500) is a painting by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], now on display in the Musée du [[Louvre]], Paris.  The surviving painting is a fragment of a [[triptych]] that was cut into several parts. ''The Ship of Fools'' was painted on one of the wings of the altarpiece, and is about two thirds of its original length. The bottom third of the panel belongs to [[Yale University]] Art Gallery and is exhibited under the title ''[[Allegory of Gluttony and Lust|Allegory of Gluttony]]''. The wing on the other side, which has more or less retained its full length, is the ''[[Death and the Miser]]'', now in the [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D.C.]]. The two panels together would have represented the two extremes of prodigality and miserliness, condemning and caricaturing both.

==Dating/provenance==

[[Dendrochronology|Dendrochronological]] study has dated the wood to 1491, and it is tempting to see the painting as a response to Sebastian Brant's [[Ship of Fools (satire)|''Das Narrenschiff'']] or even the illustrations of the first edition of 1493. Another possible source for the [[Ship of Fools|ship allegory]] is the 14th-century ''[[Le Pèlerinage de l'Âme]]'' by [[Guillaume de Deguileville]] , which was printed in Dutch in 1486 (shortly after [[William Caxton]] printed it as [[The Pilgrimage of the Soul|''The Pylgremage of the Sowle'']] in 1483).&lt;ref&gt;Walter Bosing: ''Heronymus Bosch Between Heaven and Hell'' (London 1994) reprinted as ''Bosch The Complete Paintings'' (Taschen 1994) pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Drawing of the Ship of Fools|nl|3=Het narrenschip (tekening)}}'', also in the Louvre, appears to be a later copy.

Dendrochronological studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://expert.jeroenboschplaza.com/ericdebruyn/klein-2001/?lang=en | title = Dendrochronological Analysis of Works by Hieronymus Bosch and His Followers | accessdate = 2016-08-12 | publisher = -Ludion, Rotterdam, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Peter Klein have radically altered the provenance of some paintings, for instance the Escorial ''Crowning with Thorns'' panel can only have been painted after 1525 and so is not a Bosch original. The same goes for the Rotterdam ''Marriage feast at Cana'' panel which can only have been painted after 1553. It has also become clear that the Rotterdam Pedlar tondo, the Paris ''Ship of Fools'' panel and the Washington ''Death of a Miser'' panel have been painted on wood from the same tree.

The two to eight years between the felling of the tree and  its use as a painting substrate allows ''The Ship of Fools'' to be a direct satire of a frontispiece&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://digital.lib.uh.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/p15195coll15&amp;CISOPTR=31 | title = Stultifera Navis woodcuts | accessdate = 2011-09-17 | publisher = University of Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Sebastian Brant's [[Ship_of_Fools_(satire)|book]].

== History ==
Inspired by the [[Chicano art movement]], SPARC was founded in 1976 by muralist and [[activist]] [[Judy Baca]], (who continues to serve as artistic director), [[Painting|painter]] [[Christina Schlesinger]], and [[filmmaker]] [[Donna Deitch]]. It was an outgrowth of the "Friends of the Citywide Mural Program", a [[community organization]] dedicated to supporting Baca's work with the Los Angeles Citywide Mural Program, a city-funded project to beautify city walls and divert the energies of youth in gang-afflicted areas. Almost immediately, censorship issues led to the artists realizing that they need to create an organization to back up their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A People's Guide to Los Angeles|last = Pulido|first = Laura|publisher = University of California Press|year = 23 April 2012|isbn = 978-0520270817|location = Los Angeles, California|pages = 231-233|last2 = Barraclough|first2 = Laura|last3 = Cheng|first3 = Wendy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initialism "SPARC" was chosen intentionally, as the organization was intended to "spark" "a movement toward identity and justice."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Schlesinger suggested the idea of a spark because she was inspired by the work of the 1960s group, the [[Weather Underground|Weatherman]] who used that phrase initially.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1977, SPARC took up residence in a two-story [[Art Deco]] building that had served as the Venice jail since 1929. Deitch describes that originally they "broke in" and took over and cleaned out the former jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywaQ26J6oa8|title = SPARC's 35th Year Anniversary Celebration|date = 23 December 2012|accessdate = 22 April 2015|website = SPARC Murals|publisher = YouTube|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was eventually obtained through "a lot of political maneuvering," and it was free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cultures in Contention|last = Neumaier|first = Diane|publisher = Real Comet Press|year = 1985|isbn = |location = Seattle, Washington|pages = 62-75|chapter = Baca: Our People are the Internal Exiles|url = http://icaadocs.mfah.org/icaadocs/THEARCHIVE/FullRecord/tabid/88/doc/1184487/language/en-US/Default.aspx|access-date = 21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPARC building features a gallery, five artists' studios, a darkroom, and houses Baca's [[archive]]s as well as those of [[Minna Agins]].

SPARC's first project was the monumental mural project ''[[The Great Wall of Los Angeles]]'', which is one of the largest murals in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chicano Art History: A Book of Selected Readings|last = Rickey|first = Carrie|publisher = Research Center for the Arts and Humanities, University of Texas as San Antonio|year = 1984|isbn = |location = San Antonio, Texas|pages = 87-91|chapter = The Writing on the Wall|editor-last = Quirarte|editor-first = Jacinto}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts scenes from the [[history of California]] on the side of the [[Tujunga wash]], and was created by thousands of volunteers and workers. About 400 of the mural's workers were teens, many of them "part of the juvenile justice system."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Beginning in 1988, SPARC undertook a program called Great Walls Unlimited: Neighborhood Pride, which painted 105 murals in [[List of districts and neighborhoods of Los Angeles|neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles]]. Ninety-five artists were hired to create the murals and then they hired about 1100 young people to work as apprentices in the community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Great Walls program ran from 1988 to 2003, when there was a mural moratorium in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

SPARC, along with the Mural Conservancy of Los Angeles, has been instrumental in documenting and preserving murals.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Politics and Practices of Community Public Art: Whose Murals Get Saved?|last = Weber|first = John Pitman|publisher = Getty Conservation Institute|year = 2004|isbn = |location = Los Angeles, California|pages = 14|url = http://hdl.handle.net/10020/gci_pubs/politics_community_art|access-date = 21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, both groups have created an artistic culture that views the murals of Los Angeles as part of the city's "collection" of art.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Today ==
The SPARC website hosts an archive of digital images of Los Angeles murals (currently in development), as well as a discussion forum. 

SPARC receives donations from different sources, including private businesses like [[Blue Moon (beer)|Blue Moon Brewing Company]].

The Durón Gallery inside of the SPARC building is used to "present socially relevant and politically conscious art."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.yareah.com/2014/03/16/venice-ca-art-events-dwora-fried-linda-vallejo-duron-gallery-sparc/|title = Venice CA art events.

'''The Spectre of Newby Church''' (or the "Newby Monk") is the name given to an artifact found on a photograph taken in the [[Church of Christ the Consoler]], on the grounds of [[Newby Hall]] in [[North Yorkshire]], [[United Kingdom]]. The image was taken in 1963 by the Reverend Kenneth F. Lord.&lt;ref name="au"&gt;{{cite web | title = Real or fake? Mysterious ghost pictures investigated | publisher= news.com.au | date = September 13, 2013 | url = http://www.news.com.au/technology/real-or-fake-mysterious-ghost-pictures-investigated/story-e6frfro0-1226718211697 | accessdate = April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="People"&gt;{{cite news | title = World's most famous ghost pictures | newspaper = The People | pages = 4–5 | date = September 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the artifact appears to resemble a human, much speculation has been had regarding what type of person might be in the image. Most speculation by believers has concluded that it resembles a 16th-century monk, with a white shroud over his face, possibly to mask leprosy or another disfigurement. Others contend that it is an accomplice in a costume.&lt;ref name="People"/&gt;

Initial claims suggested that the figure would measure at 9 feet tall, but its feet are not visible and it could easily be standing on a box, giving the impression of height.&lt;ref&gt;Bord, J. ''Ghosts''. [[David &amp; Charles]], 1974. P. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

On looking over the image, purported photographic experts{{who|date=May 2016}} have concluded that the image is not the result of double exposure, although Rick Burden, founder of the Ghost Hunters of Australia website, believes to be "probably fake." It resembles many other double exposure hoaxes.&lt;ref name="au"/&gt;

[[File:Mals, die Sankt Benedikt Kirche Dm15779 foto1 2012-08-13 10.44.jpg|thumb|]]

'''St. Benedikt''' is a pre-Romanesque church in [[Mals]], [[South Tyrol]], known for its [[Carolingian period|Carolingian-era]] frescoes.

It was built in the second half of the 8th century. Until the 12th century, it was owned by the [[bishops of Chur]]. 
In the 12th century, the [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] tower was added.

In the 18th century, under [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the building was used for storage. Use as a sacral building was resumed only in the 20th century, after the discovery of the Carolingian frescoes.

The frescoes are dated to c. AD 800. They belong to a limited set of surviving frescoes of the Carolingian period, alongside those of the nearby St. Johann abbey in [[Val Müstair]], [[Grisons]].
The fresoes are mostly distributed in three [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] in the altar wall, showing [[Jesus Christ]] in the center, flanked by pope [[Gregory the Great]] and [[Saint Stephen]].
On the walls separating the niches are [[donor portrait]]s below a troop of twelve angels, and scenes showing Gregory writing his ''Dialogi'' and disputing with  [[Paulus Diaconus]], alongsides scenes showing [[Paul of Tarsus]] and a fragment of a scene from the life of [[Saint Benedict]].

'''''The Artist in His Museum''''' is an 1822 [[self-portrait]] by the American painter [[Charles Willson Peale]] (1741–1827). It depicts the 81-year-old artist posed in Peale's Museum, then occupying the second floor of [[Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/91224.html Admission ticket to Peale's Museum] from Philadelphia Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt; The nearly life-size painting is in the collection of the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]].

==History==
Toward the end of his career, beginning in 1822, he painted seven self-portraits that together formed the final motif of his art and the final flourishing of his talent. ''The Artist in His Museum'' is a large-scale [[oil-on-canvas]] work painted in about two months, and is the most emblematic of Peale's many self-portraits.

Peale was a [[naturalist]] as well as a painter. In 1784 he founded the Philadelphia Museum, situated at the time of the painting in the Long Room of the Pennsylvania State House (now [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]]). The curation of the museum dominated his career from that point; he would on occasion announce his retirement from painting or his return to it.

In 1822 he was asked by the museum's trustees to paint a full-length portrait of himself for the museum. The artist endeavored to "''not only make it a lasting monument of my art as a Painter, but also that the design should be expressive, that I bring forth into public view, the beauties of Nature and Art, the rise &amp; progress of the Museum.''"&lt;ref name="Miller1990a"/&gt; He further said, "''I wish it may excite some admiration, otherwise my labor is lost, except that it is a good likeness.''"&lt;ref name="Ward1993a"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Celebration of Self: The Portraiture of Charles Willson Peale and Rembrandt Peale, 1822-27|author=Ward, David C.|journal=American Art|volume=7|issue=1|date=Winter 1993|pages=8–27|doi=10.1086/424174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peale's determination to honor his career is reflected in his having painted two preliminary versions of ''The Artist'', unusual for an artist who took pride in producing likenesses  with little preparatory work.

==Description==
[[File:C W Peale - The Exhumation of the Mastadon.jpeg|left|thumb|250px|Peale's ''Exhuming the First American Mastodon'' (1806).]]

There are three spaces in the work. The foreground of the painting depicts in low light some natural objects of the museum. At the front left, a dead [[wild turkey]] sits with Peale's [[taxidermy|taxidermic]] tools, brought back by his son [[Titian Peale|Titian]] and waiting to join the collection to reveal its meaning as a national symbol. Another American symbol, the [[bald eagle]], is higher on the left edge of the canvas, mounted by Peale—"the strength of the Eagles Eye is really astonishing"—and is now one of his few surviving specimens.&lt;ref name="Brigham1996a"&gt;{{cite journal|title='Ask the Beasts, and They Shall Teach Thee': The Human Lessons of Charles Willson Peale's Natural History Displays|author=Brigham, David R.|journal=The Huntington Library Quarterly|volume=59|issue=2/3|year=1996|pages=182–206|doi=10.2307/3817666}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the extreme left is an early donation: a [[paddlefish]] from the [[Allegheny River]] in an upright case, marked "With this article the Museum commenced, June, 1784".&lt;ref name="Alexander1995a_p45"&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Masters: Their Museums and Their Influence|author=Alexander, Edward Porter|year=1995|pages=45|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=0-7619-9131-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Peale's left lie the bones of a [[mastodon]]; the assembled skeleton that shows from behind the curtain was the museum's main attraction. Peale had unearthed and reconstructed a mastodon in 1800, an event he chronicled in his 1806 painting ''Exhuming the First American Mastodon'' (left). The artist's palette and brushes to his left contribute to the autobiographical statement.

The middle ground highlights Peale. In the painting, the artist invites the viewer into his museum; he pulls back a draped crimson curtain, which divides the painting's space, to reveal the collection. He used a similar motif on the printed acknowledgments he sent to museum donors, on which a curtain labeled "Nature" is held back to reveal a landscape with animals.&lt;ref name="Brigham1996a"/&gt; According to critic David C. Ward, the positioning of Peale "has the effect of creating a dialectic between life and art, painter and audience, the individual and American culture at large, and finally past and present. The figure of Peale bridges these realms&amp;nbsp;… further drawing attention to and heightening the impact of his creativity."
[[File:Pennacadstamp.jpg|thumb|upright|The painting appeared on a stamp commemorating the Academy's 150th anniversary]]

The deep background behind the curtain gives the portrait its unique significance. Peale collected thousands of specimens of birds and other animals for his museum by soliciting donations or hunting them himself. The museum's receding shelves display animal species organized by [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean]] classification, and above them are portraits of revolutionary heroes and other notable Americans, whose placement suggests the position of humans in the [[great chain of being]].&lt;ref name="Brigham1996a"/&gt; Peale believed that [[physiognomy]], whether of humans in portraits or of animal specimens, provided insight into character.&lt;ref name="Brigham1996a"/&gt; To Peale, the behavior of animals served as a model for a moral, productive, and socially harmonious society.&lt;ref name="Brigham1996a"/&gt; In the far background a child represents posterity benefiting from the museum's lessons in [[natural history]].&lt;ref name="Miller1990a"&gt;Miller, Lillian B.

Yet as the space recedes, so does Peale's life and the intellectual and scientific culture of the time—the [[American Enlightenment]].

:''For the occupation upon which this painting was based, see [[crossing sweeper]].''

'''''The Crossing Sweeper''''' is an 1858 painting by [[William Powell Frith]] which has been described as breaking "new ground in its description of the collision of wealth and poverty on a London street."&lt;ref name='Bills'&gt;{{cite news | first=Mark | last=Bills | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=William Powell Frith's 'The Crossing Sweeper': An Archetypal Image of Mid-Nineteenth Century London | date=May 2004 | publisher= | work =The Burlington Magazine | pages =300 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frith later painted several versions of the same subject, updating the fashions.

==Subject==
The painting depicts a "crossing sweeper" offering his services to a young woman who is looking out for a gap in traffic to cross the road. Crossing sweepers offered to sweep the streets in front of wealthy-looking pedestrians in the hope of a tip. The roads at that time were often smeared with horse dung because of the prevalence of horse-drawn vehicles. The woman has already lifted her dress to avoid its becoming soiled as she crosses.

The sweepers were often regarded as nuisances who were little more than beggars.&lt;ref name="Vict"/&gt; The woman in the painting may be pointedly trying to ignore the boy. This was a common theme in commentary on sweepers. An 1853 ''Punch'' cartoon entitled "the crossing sweeper nuisance" depicted a hapless middle-class man surrounded by importunate boys holding out their hands for money.&lt;ref name="Vict"&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/victorian/periodicals/punch/17.html Victorian Web: the Crossing Seeper Nuisance].&lt;/ref&gt; In an 1858 issue of ''Building News'' similarly negative sentiments were expressed of "those juvenile highwaymen who, broom in hand, take possessions of our crossings and level black mail upon the public in general, and timid females in particular."&lt;ref name="Bills 303"&gt;Mark Bills, 'William Powell Frith's 'The Crossing Sweeper': An Archetypal Image of Mid-Nineteenth Century London', ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', May 2004, pp. 301&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frith's sweeper is ostentatiously deferential, while also pushing close to the woman, setting extremes of poverty and wealth up against one another, a theme the artist explored in other works such as ''Poverty and Wealth'', ''For Better, For Worse'' and ''[[The Derby Day]]''.

==Versions==
[[File:William Powell Frith The crossing sweeper 1893.jpg|thumb|left|A version with updated fashions]]
The 1858 painting is in the [[Museum of London]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumoflondonprints.com/image/64954/william-powell-frith-the-crossing-sweeper-1858 Museum of London: The Crossing Sweeper (original and prints)]&lt;/ref&gt; it was also reproduced in the same year as an engraving, becoming a well-known image.

Frith created several copies in the 1890s, at a time in his career when much of his output comprised variations on his famous works. An 1893 version covers the brief glimpse of red stocking seen in the original with a lace undergarment. Another version from the same year updates the image by depicting the woman wearing the fashions of the 1890s.

'''''The Jacksons: An American Dream''''' is a four-hour American [[miniseries]] broadcast in two halves on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and originally broadcast on November 15 through November 18, 1992.&lt;ref name=tusca&gt;{{cite news |title=Highlights |page = 6A |first=Faye B.|last=Zuckerman |newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]] |date=November 14, 1992 |accessdate= 2010-03-01|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AzkdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5KUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=the%20jacksons%20an%20american%20dream%20viewers&amp;pg=4993%2C3487229 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based upon the history of the [[Jackson family]], one of the most successful musical families in show business, and the early and successful years of the popular [[Motown Records|Motown]] group [[The Jackson 5]].

The miniseries was executive produced by [[Suzanne de Passe]] and Stan Marguiles, produced by Joyce Eliason, [[Jermaine Jackson]] and Margaret Maldonado and directed by [[Karen Arthur]]. The movie was filmed in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Pittsburgh, PA|Pittsburgh]], where director Arthur had previously filmed her feature film ''[[Lady Beware]]''.

''The Jacksons: An American Dream'' is based on [[Katherine Jackson]]'s ''My Family'' [[autobiography]]. A critical and commercial success, the program won an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Choreography. The title alludes to the iconic concept of the '[[American Dream]]'.

==Plot==
The miniseries stars [[Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs]] as the Jacksons' patriarch [[Joseph Jackson (manager)|Joseph Jackson]], [[Angela Bassett]] as the family matriarch [[Katherine Jackson]], [[Alex Burrall]], [[Jason Weaver]] and [[Wylie Draper]] played [[Michael Jackson]] in different eras, while [[Bumper Robinson]] and [[Terrence Howard]] played [[Jackie Jackson]] in different eras, Shakiem Jamar Evans and Angel Vargas played [[Tito Jackson]], [[Margaret Avery]] as Katherine's mother Martha Scruse, [[Holly Robinson Peete]] as [[Diana Ross]], [[Billy Dee Williams]] as [[Berry Gordy]] and [[Vanessa L. Williams]] as [[Suzanne de Passe]]. The opening titles of the film shows footage of the real Jacksons rehearsing, performing on stage, a few clips from the "[[Can You Feel It (The Jacksons song)|Can You Feel It]]" music video, album covers, magazine covers and pictures of the family.
The film is mostly based on the autobiography written by Katherine Jackson, who issued the 1990 autobiography, ''My Family''. Part one of the film was based on how Joseph and Katherine managed to raise their children, first in [[Gary, Indiana]], then later dealing with The Jackson 5's early fame and its consequences. Part two of the film is based on the struggles of young [[Michael Jackson]] as he deals with his brothers marrying early into The Jackson 5 success, his problems with [[acne]] as a teenager, his eventual solo superstardom based on the success of his albums ''[[Off the Wall (album)|Off the Wall]]'' and ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' and his legendary Motown 25 performance of "[[Billie Jean]]" as well as his difficult relationship with his father.

Michael Jackson’s voice is heard on:  "[[Beat It]]," "[[Human Nature (Michael Jackson song)|Human Nature]]," "[[Billie Jean]]," "[[I Want You Back]]," "[[I Wanna Be Where You Are]]," "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]," "[[Rockin' Robin (song)|Rockin' Robin]]," "[[ABC (song)|ABC]]," and "[[Dancing Machine]]."   On all other songs, the Michael Jackson vocal part is performed by [[Anthony Harrell]], [[Jason Weaver]] or [[Kipp Lennon]].

==Historical inaccuracies==
{{expand section|date=December 2015}}
* The group is shown making a record of Wilbert Harrison's "Kansas City". "Kansas City" was never covered by the Jackson 5, although the band did multiple covers of early hits.
* In the Motown audition scene, Berry Gordy was not actually in attendance. Instead, the audition was videotaped and shown to Gordy at a later time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-5117610.html |title=Motown's Gordy On Discovering Jackson | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Jacksons are shown getting an audition for Motown due to winning a talent show at the Apollo Theatre, and Joseph is touting it as their first signing. In actuality, the group's first recording contract was offered by Steeltown Records, a smaller agency based in their native Gary, Indiana, in 1967. The group had done one audition for Motown and was rejected. Following their moderate success with a couple of single tracks in Steeltown, the Jackson 5 felt confident enough to audition a second time for Motown, after which they were signed. In the film, prior to the Motown debut, Michael is seen in a recording studio, which may have been reference to their early career with Steeltown Records.
* In the scene where Michael is seen shooting for the Pepsi commercial which caused his scalp to catch fire, it shows his body rolling down the stairs. In fact he actually walked down the stairs with his hair on fire and later realized and did a one rotation spin (not the usual spin move he did) and shaking his head wildly from the pain. However, the realistic display of Michael's burning was not seen until video leaked after Michael's 2009 death.
* The film's depiction of Michael performing "[[Billie Jean]]" at the [[Motown 25]] television special, has Jackson wearing his trademark white glove on his right hand. In reality, Michael wore it on his left hand that night. The style of the film's glove is also notably different, compared to the factual one.
* The film lists 1959 as Michael's birth. Michael was actually born in 1958.
* When the group performs on the Diana Ross special, Michael announces that the song [[I Want You Back]] is out on sale everywhere after they perform the song. In reality, Michael announced his statement before the group performed the song.
* In the documentary, when the group performed the [[Star Spangled Banner]] at the baseball game, they sang it acapella and took place at a regular baseball game with unknown teams. In reality, a marching band accompanied the brothers when they sang the national anthem at Game 1 of the [[1970 World Series]], which pitted the [[Cincinnati Reds]] against the [[Baltimore Orioles]].
*In part 1 of the miniseries, they showed the year 1945 as the year Joseph and Katherine Jackson met as teenagers in [[East Chicago, Indiana|East Chicago]]. They actually met two years later in 1947 when Joseph was 19 and Katherine 17.
*When five-year-old Michael Jackson is shown singing "Climb Ev'ry Mountain", each Jackson family member, including Joseph, is in attendance. The real life Joseph was actually working overtime in U.S. Steel while Michael performed this. Joseph's father Samuel instead viewed the performance with the family. Joseph wouldn't see his son perform until he began singing with Jermaine during a group rehearsal.
*In the scene where Joseph catches son Tito playing his guitar after the string broke, he reportedly whips him with the belt. However, family members and friends differ from what happened; while early Jackson 5 band members such as Milford Hite, claimed Tito was whipped, both Tito and Jermaine denied that the whipping took place that night and that Joseph just threatened to "whip Tito" if he played wrong after Joseph fixed the string.
*In the scene after the alleged discipline by Joseph, the four eldest Jackson brothers began singing for Joseph while Michael is rebuffed by his mother. In reality, only Jackie, Tito and Jermaine sang for Joseph. In Katherine's book, she claimed that Michael was the fourth member and that Marlon almost didn't join because Joseph felt Marlon "wasn't talented enough". Katherine eventually convinced Joseph to put Marlon in the group though he reportedly didn't sing for the group until the group signed with Motown. In the early years, he played tambourine with them while Michael played congas.
*In the bedroom scene with Jermaine and a groupie, Michael and Marlon are seen hiding in the bed and playing a prank on Jermaine by touching the groupie's leg only to run out of the bedroom when Jermaine catches them. In reality, according to Michael, Jermaine had Michael and Marlon sleeping in the next bed and told them to "pretend" they were sleeping while he and the groupies had sex.
*In the scene where Katherine convinces Michael to partake on The Victory Tour, she gives Michael an emotional speech about family; however in biographies on the family, Katherine practically begs Michael to take part in the tour, which he agrees to. Following the tour, Michael left the group in December 1984, with Marlon leaving the following month.

==Reception==
''The Jacksons: An American Dream'' became one of the most popular and successful music-biography miniseries of the 1990s.

The series won an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Choreography, and was also nominated for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Hairstyling for a Miniseries or a Special, Outstanding Miniseries, and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Drama Miniseries or a Special.

Bumper Robinson won a [[Young Artist Award]] for Best Young Actor in a Television Movie, and Alex Burrall and Jason Weaver both won a special award for Outstanding Young Performers Starring in a Mini-Series. The miniseries was later rebroadcast on [[VH1]] and released to [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]. The DVD version of the miniseries was released as a two-disc set. The first disc was named "The Early Years" and the second disc was named "The Success Years". In 2004, [[VH1]] would produce ''[[Man in the Mirror: The Michael Jackson Story]]'', which picked up Michael's life from the end of ''The Jacksons'' to the present, which at the time included him standing trial on charges of child molestation.

The miniseries aired frequently after the [[death of Michael Jackson]]. It has been shown on [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]], [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]], [[BET Her|Centric]] and [[VH1]].

'''''The Oak at Flagey''''' (French - ''Le Chêne de Flagey'') or '''''The Vercingetorix Oak''''' (''Le Chêne de Vercingétorix'') is an 1864 landscape painting by [[Gustave Courbet]], measuring 89 by 110 cm. It shows an oak near the Courbet family farm in the village of [[Flagey, Doubs]], a few kilometres from [[Ornans]] in [[Franche-Comté]], named in relation to [[Vercingetorix]]. The oak was later struck by lightning and no longer survives.

In 1880 the artist's sister Juliette Courbet sold it to the banker [[Henry C. Gibson]] and on the latter's death it was offered to the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in 1896. It was sold at [[Sotheby's|Sotheby's New York]] in 1987 to a Japanese collector, [[Michimasa Murauchi]], for $450 000. It was then bought for 4.5 million Euros in 2012 by the [[musée Courbet]], including 2.7 million Euros from private donations and 1.3 million Euros from public funds. It was lent to the ''Volez, Voguez, Voyagez'' exhibition on [[Louis Vuitton]] at the [[Grand Palais]].

'''''The Reverend Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch''''', better known by its shorter title '''''The Skating Minister''''', is an [[oil painting]] attributed to [[Henry Raeburn]] in the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] in [[Edinburgh]]. It was practically unknown until about 1949, but has since become one of Scotland's best-known paintings. It is considered an icon of [[Scottish culture]], painted during one of the most remarkable periods in the country's history, the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].

== Robert Walker==
The minister portrayed in this painting is [[Robert Walker (minister)|Robert Walker]].  He was a [[Church of Scotland]] minister who was born on 30 April 1755 in [[Monkton, Ayrshire]].  When Walker was a child, his father had been minister of the [[Church of Scotland|Scots Kirk]] in [[Rotterdam]], so the young Robert almost certainly learnt to skate on the frozen canals of the Netherlands. He was licensed by the [[List of Church of Scotland synods and presbyteries|Presbytery of Edinburgh]] in 1770 at the age of fifteen. He married Jean Fraser in 1778 and had five children. He became a member of the [[Royal Company of Archers]] in 1779 and their chaplain in 1798.

He was minister of the [[Kirk of the Canongate|Canongate Kirk]] as well as being a member of the [[Edinburgh Skating Club]], the first [[figure skating club]] formed anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name=Hines2011&gt;{{cite book|first=James R. |last=Hines |title=Historical Dictionary of Figure Skating |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSEkqy6BS44C&amp;pg=PA150 |date=2011-04-22 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-7085-7 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The club met on [[Duddingston Loch]] as shown in the painting, or on [[Lochend, Edinburgh|Lochend]] loch to its northeast between Edinburgh and [[Leith]], when these lochs were suitably frozen.

==Appraisal==
The painting is unusual in both its composition and its setting. The subject matter, perhaps intentionally conveying Walker's ties with Holland, is reminiscent of seventeenth-century Dutch artworks, particularly those of [[Hendrick Avercamp]].  The Reverend skates in the efficient but difficult "travelling position", with both arms folded across his chest and his stern black outfit contrasts with the wild backdrop of Duddingston Loch.  According to [[Andrew Graham-Dixon]], "The pinkish grey crags and sky have been painted with great freedom, whereas the figure of Reverend Robert Walker himself is so tightly drawn and painted that he appears almost as a black silhouette against an icy, vaporous wilderness. Perhaps this was the artist's way of suggesting that, for all his apparent probity and self-restraint, the minister was at heart something of a romantic – a man, at any rate, with a penchant for communing with nature."&lt;ref name=AGD&gt;{{cite web|first=Andrew |last=Graham-Dixon|title= ITP 241: Reverend Dr Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch, by Henry Raeburn. c.1795.  |date=12 December 2004|work= Sunday Telegraph|authorlink=Andrew Graham-Dixon|url=http://www.andrewgrahamdixon.com/archive/itp-241-reverend-dr-robert-walker-skating-on-duddingston-loch-by-henry-raeburn-c1795.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian Duncan Thomson notes that, "The filigree within the buckle on the strap at the skater's right knee and the taut complexities of the arrangement of the pink ribbons that binds the skates to his shoes are a reminder of the manipulative skills that Raeburn must have developed during his apprenticeship [as a jeweller and goldsmith] ... perhaps the tour de force of observation and the finding of equivalent forms are the marks that the skater (or those who have circled with him) has made on the ice: the curving grooves incised with some appropriate tool in a liquid, greyish white which has been spread over a darker grey that has been allowed to dry and the edges of these tiny furrows, more pronounced towards the bottom of the picture, tipped in with a purer white to simulate the froth of ice thrown aside by the cutting blade."&lt;ref name=AGD/&gt;

==Attribution controversy==
In March 2005, a curator from the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] suggested that the painting was by French artist [[Henri-Pierre Danloux]] rather than by Henry Raeburn. Once this information had been brought to the attention of the Gallery, the label on the painting was altered to read “Recent research has suggested that the picture was actually painted [...] by Henri-Pierre Danloux.” Since this time, many people have debated this idea. It has been argued that Danloux was in Edinburgh during the 1790s, which happens to be the time period when ''The Skating Minister ''was created. Supposedly the canvas and scale of the painting appears to be that of a French painter, although Raeburn critics argue otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://news.scotsman.com/news/Doubts-over-Skating-Minister-cut.2614249.jp| title = Doubts over Skating Minister cut no ice with art experts| author = Blackley, Michael| date = 2005-03-30| accessdate = 2010-05-28| newspaper = The Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Despite continuing controversy about its attribution, ''The Skating Minister'' was sent to New York City in 2005 to be exhibited in [[Christie's]] for [[Tartan Day]], an important Scottish celebration. James Holloway, director of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery,  told ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper that his "gut reaction" was that it is by Raeburn.  The newspaper reported that "it is understood that [[Timothy Clifford|Sir Timothy Clifford]], director-general of the National Galleries of Scotland, now accepts the painting is a Raeburn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://heritage.scotsman.com/tartanweek/If-Skating-Minister-isnt-Scottish.2686955.jp| title = If Skating Minister isn't Scottish, why send him to Tartan Week in New York?| author = Roberts, Laura| date = 2005-12-16| accessdate = 2010-05-28| newspaper = Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Cambridge UK based musical group [[Clean Bandit]] based a character in their music video for their song "[[Dust Clears]]" on ''The Skating Minister'' painting. The video has been posted by the band on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdfL2nY-Xs8 Clean Bandit - Dust Clears]. [[YouTube]]&lt;/ref&gt; The skating minister is portrayed by skater Nick Martin and the skating scenes were filmed on [[Lake Vattern]] in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onthewight.com/2014/07/23/clean-bandit-skating-minister-isle-wight-artist-nick-martin/ |title=Clean Bandit's 'Skating Minister' reveals Island connection |publisher=Onthewight.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A copy of ''The Skating Minister'' can be seen displayed in the apartment of con-man [[Neal Caffrey]] in the USA television series ''[[White Collar (TV series)|White Collar]]''.

'''The Vera Project''', or '''VERA''', is an [[all-ages]], [[non-profit]] [[youth]] arts organization in [[Seattle]], Washington.

==Overview==
Based on the Vera club in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], Netherlands.  The name Vera comes from the phrase Veri Et Recti Amici, which is Latin meaning "true and sincere friends".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=vera groningen - about|url=http://www.vera-groningen.nl/about#en|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seattle's VERA Project was founded in 2001 by James Keblas, Shannon Stewart&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Luck|first=Katherine|title=The Vera Project|url=http://www.myjournalmagazine.com/aug-2012/item/227-the-vera-project|work=Journal, Your Community Magazine|publisher=Metropolitan Graphics, Inc.|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (both studied at the [[University of Groningen]] in 1999), and Kate Becker (founder of the [[Old Redmond Firehouse]]), along with the help of many other community organizers and the City of Seattle.

A good description of the project is a quote from its own website:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=the Vera Project's web site|url=http://theveraproject.org/about/|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Vera is an all-ages volunteer fueled music and arts venue. By engaging participants at all levels of music production and community organizing, Vera strives to fulfill its mission to foster a participatory creative culture through popular music concerts, arts programs, experiential learning and volunteer opportunities for all ages, especially young people. Vera’s programs are always all ages, with a focus on young people ages 14 to 24. Most Vera programs are at the Seattle Center venue, and include:''

==Events==
The Vera Project's first event was hosted on January 27, 2001 at the [[International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers|IBEW]] Local 46&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brodeur|first=Nicole|title=Vera helps keep teens in tune|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20060409&amp;slug=brodeur09m1|accessdate=16 May 2013|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=April 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and featured local artists [[The Murder City Devils]], [[Botch (band)|Botch]] and [[The Blood Brothers (band)|The Blood Brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mark|first=Baumgarten|title=Mayor's Arts Awards: The Vera Project|url=http://cityartsonline.com/mayors-arts-awards-vera-project|accessdate=16 May 2013|newspaper=City Arts (Seattle)|date=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 1,000 people attended including local press and city officials. The Vera Project went on to host several more shows at IBEW Local 46 and then moved on to the [[Theatre Off Jackson]] when their lease expired at the IBEW Local 46. The Vera Project hosted shows at the Theatre Off Jackson until they found a longer-lasting home at 1916 4th Ave in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scanlon|first=Tom|title=Unemployed?

The Vera Project hosted shows at various venues in Seattle until their current location, the corner of Warren Ave N. and Republican at the Seattle Center, was finished in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scanlon|first=Tom|title=Vera Project: movin' on up|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/entertainment/2003575876_vera20.html|accessdate=16 May 2013|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=February 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new Vera is open for business and hosting about two shows a week, along with a variety of other arts and media-related programming.

The Vera Project has hosted many successful local and national music acts including [[Band of Horses]], [[Chairlift (band)|Chairlift]], [[Dan Deacon]], [[The Evens]], [[Fruit Bats (band)|Fruit Bats]], [[Harvey Danger]], [[Lightning Bolt (band)|Lightning Bolt]], [[Minus the Bear]], [[Murs (rapper)|Murs]], [[No Age]], [[Shellac (band)|Shellac]], [[The Shins]], [[TV on the Radio]], [[Weezer]], [[Why? (American band)|WHY?]], [[Quasi]], [[Health (band)|Health]], [[Surfer Blood]], [[The Gossip]], [[Fleet Foxes]], [[Macklemore]] and [[Titus Andronicus (band)|Titus Andronicus]]. The [[Bellevue, Washington | Bellevue]], [[Seattle]] and [[West Seattle, Seattle | West Seattle]] versions of the [[School of Rock (company) | School of Rock]] perform shows frequently at this venue.

The weapons master is present whenever a scene with a weapon is to be shot. They present the actor with the weapon just prior to the scene, and they take control of the weapon when the scene is done. It is the primary function of the weapons master to ensure that the weapons under their control do not cause harm to the cast, crew or production property. Secondary functions include ensuring that the weapons can achieve the director's goals in terms of appearance and function, and that they meet the continuity requirements for the production. While some weapons masters work exclusively in film production, others are specialists outside of the media profession who are called in because of their familiarity, licensing and qualifications with the weapons in question. Some weapons masters (particularly in lower-budget productions) are also responsible for training the actors.  Prior to the 1980s, weapons were frequently the responsibility of the property master or his assistant, but since then, it has become increasingly common in the industry for the property master to a hire a dedicated weapons master in order to reduce the burden on himself.  However, it is still common for the property master to double as the weapons master, as a cost-saving measure, on productions where [[National Firearms Act]]-regulated firearms (such as [[machine guns]] or [[sawed-off]] [[shotguns]]) are not being used.&lt;ref name="Hart2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hart|first=Eric|title=The Prop Building Guidebook: For Theatre, Film, and TV|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TgVSaksNhrkC&amp;pg=PT21|date=11 February 2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-08573-4|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William''' is the nickname of a '''faience hippopotamus''' from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] who serves as an informal mascot of the museum. Found in a shaft associated with the [[Upper Egypt]] tomb chapel of "The Steward, Senbi" in what is now [[Meir, Egypt]], William dates from c. 1961 – 1878&amp;nbsp;B.C. during the reigns of [[Senusret I]] and [[Senusret II]].&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/544227 |title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art – Hippopotamus |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2013-12-03 |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This small figurine in [[Egyptian faience]], a clay-less material, has become popular not only for his endearing appearance but also because his defining characteristics illustrate many of the most salient facets of craft production in ancient Egypt during this time.

William is only one of several objects associated with the tomb of "The Steward, Senbi" that were acquired by the Metropolitan Museum in 1917. According to the Museum’s ''Bulletin'' from that year, this [[hippopotamus]] is a “particularly fine example of a type found, in common with various other animal forms, among the funerary furnishings of tombs of the Middle Kingdom” and also an exemplary piece of [[Egyptian faience]].&lt;ref name="Egyptian Hippopotamus Figure 1917"&gt;"An Egyptian Hippopotamus Figure." ''Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art'' 4 (April 1917): 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

William can be seen in Gallery 111 at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].

==Egyptian faience==
[[File:Medio regno, XII-inizio XIII dinastia, vitello, cane e babbuino in faience, 1938-1630 ac ca..JPG|thumb|Other faience pieces from the XII Dynasty.]]
Related to glass insofar as it attains a "vitreous" appearance, Egyptian faience was, according to [[David Grose|David F. Grose]], “a material made from powdered quartz covered with a true vitreous coating.” Significantly more porous and malleable than glass proper, faience could be shaped by hand or cast in molds to create vessels or other objects.&lt;ref&gt;David Frederick Grose, ''The Toledo Museum of Art, Early Ancient Glass: Core-Formed, Rod-Formed, and Cast Vessels and Objects from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Roman Empire, 1600&amp;nbsp;BC to AD 50'' (Manchester: Hudson Hills Press, 1999), 29.&lt;/ref&gt; While similar raw materials are involved in the creation of both faience and glass (crushed quartz or sand mixed with lime and either natron or plant ash), faience ultimately lacks the rigid crystalline structure of found in modern glass. Significantly, both glass and faience were used, according to Paul T. Nicholson, to imitate semi-precious stones in less costly materials, and both were valued for their beauty and durability.&lt;ref&gt;Paul T. Nicholson, ''Egyptian Faience and Glass'' (Buckinghamshire: Shire, 1993), 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although not [[pottery]] on a strict definition, since it contains no [[clay]], faience is often treated as pottery.


This statuette demonstrates the importance of a variety of iconographic styles in Middle Kingdom era burial practices. As Nicholson writes, animal figures were common during this period and “hippopotamus figurines, usually decorated with aquatic plants, probably symbolized the revitalizing properties of the Nile”. They may have held some kind of religious significance, as they were sometimes associated with one of the forms of [[Set (mythology)|Seth]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, ''Egyptian Faience and Glass,'' 23.&lt;/ref&gt; As not all hippo statues from this era were elaborately painted, William is a particularly important example; he has been “covered with a decoration in black line of lotus flowers, buds, and leaves” to signal his “natural surroundings among the lowlands of the Nile.”&lt;ref name="Egyptian Hippopotamus Figure 1917"/&gt; As noted in the Metropolitan Museum’s summary, the hippopotamus was one of the most threatening animals for ancient Egyptians and, in this case, three of William’s legs were probably purposely broken to prevent him from harming the deceased in the afterlife (the museum has since restored these legs).&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"/&gt;

==Name==
In the early 20th century, Captain H.M. Raleigh and his family owned a photograph of the hippopotamus, and began to refer to him as William. Raleigh published an article about the hippo for the magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' on March 18, 1931, in which he wrote, "He is described on the back of the frame as "Hippopotamus with Lotus Flowers, Buds and Leaves, XII Dynasty (about 1950 B.C.), Series VII, Number i, Egyptian Faience;" but to us he is simply William."&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, June 1931"&gt;http://www.metmuseum.org/~/media/Files/Give%20and%20Join/Planned%20Giving/William%20Bulletin%20article.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times: FYI"&gt;{{cite news |last=Schneider |first=Daniel |date= 29 December 2002 |title=F.Y.I. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/nyregion/fyi-603120.html |newspaper=New York Times |location= New York City|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hippopotamus, Metropolitan Museum of Art"&gt;http://www.metmuseum.org/content/interactives/Learn_About_Color/william.swf?movieName=william&lt;/ref&gt; The article was reprinted in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Bulletin in June 1931, and the name stuck.&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, June 1931"/&gt; In 1936 the Met released a book entitled ''William and his Friends: A Group of Notable Creatures in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.''&lt;ref name="William and His Friends, 1936"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://designarchives.aiga.org/#/entries/%2Bid%3A18968/_/detail/relevance/asc/0/3/18968/william-and-his-friends-a-group-of-notable-creatures-in-the-metropolitan-museum-of-art/1|title=William and his Friends, A Group of Notable Creatures in The Metropolitan Museum of Art|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=American Institute of Graphic Arts |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, William has continued to appear in some museum logos and merchandise for both children and adults. The Met first began selling cast reproductions of William in the 1950s&lt;ref name="NY Times: FYI" /&gt; which today are manufactured by M.
