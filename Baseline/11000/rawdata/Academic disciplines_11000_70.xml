      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8933">{{about|the representative body of the social sciences in the United Kingdom}}

The '''Academy of Social Sciences''' is a representative body for [[Social Sciences|social sciences]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The Academy promotes social science through its sponsorship of the [[Campaign for Social Science]], its links with Government on a variety of matters, and its own policy work in issuing public comment, responding to official consultations, and organising meetings and events about social science. It confers the title of Fellow upon nominated social scientists following a process of peer review. The Academy comprises over 1000 Fellows and 41 [[Learned society|learned societies]] based in the UK and Europe.

== History and structure ==
The Academy’s origins lie in the formation of a representative body for the social science learned societies in 1982, the '''Association of Learned Societies in the Social Sciences''' ('''ALSISS'''). From 1999 to 2007 it was called the Academy of Learned Societies for the Social Sciences before changing to its current name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jordanwatch.co.uk/reports/details/03847936/academyofsocialsciences.html JordanWatch.uk], retrieved on 17 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy is run by a Council of 21 members, with Professor Roger Goodman FAcSS as its current Chair, and Professor Sir [[Ivor Crewe]] FAcSS, Master of [[University College, Oxford]], as its current President. 7 Council members are elected by the Academy’s Fellows, 7 by its Learned Societies and 7 are appointed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://acss.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Academy-of-Social-Sciences-Memorandum-and-Articles-of-Association-amended-March-2013.pdf Academy website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy ==
The Academy advocates social science by interacting with Government and other organisations, and co-ordinates the responses of social scientists to Government consultation documents. Past consultations include:

* Independent Review of Implementation of [[RCUK]] Policy on Open Access.
* [[Public Administration Select Committee]] Enquiry on 'Building Civil service Skills for the Future'
* The [[Office for National Statistics]] consultation on the future of the Census &lt;ref&gt;[http://acss.org.uk/publication-category/consultation-responses/ Academy website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy also puts forward suggestions to the Government about which social scientists should carry out its Foresight research projects,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bis.gov.uk/foresight/ BIS website]&lt;/ref&gt; which look at important issues and how these might change over the next 20 to 80 years.

A developing part of the Academy’s work is to bring researchers and organisations using research closer together to improve the evidence upon which public policy is based and to increase the impact of research.

== Publications and events ==
The Academy has produced a series of [http://acss.org.uk/publication-category/making-the-case/ ‘Making the Case for the Social Sciences’] booklets which give examples of important social science research which has made a difference to policy or practice. These are: Wellbeing; Ageing; Sustainability; the Environment and Climate Change; Crime; Sport and Leisure; Management; Scotland; Longitudinal Studies, Mental Wellbeing, Wales and Dementia. Further titles are in preparation. The Academy also publishes a cross-disciplinary peer-reviewed journal, [http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rsoc21/current#.Uo34U9K9lA0 ''Contemporary Social Science'']. The Academy holds regular events, such as conferences on the ethics of social media research and the future of the [[Research Excellence Framework]]. It holds an Annual Lecture each summer, and its President's Lunch each winter. It also arranges (with the [[British Library]]) a public lecture series Enduring Ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/bldept/socsci/events/socscievents.html | title=Social sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fellows==
{{main|Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences}}
Part of the Academy’s work is to recognise social scientists who are held in esteem by their peer group and whose life and work have had an impact in advancing social science. They are nominated and the nominations are then subject to peer review. Fellows are academics, policy-makers and practitioners, and are entitled to use the letters "FAcSS" after their name. In November 2014 there were 1000 Fellows, just over 1% of the 90,000 total membership of the 41 learned society members of the Academy.

Fellows were previously known as Academicians and used the post-nominal letter "AcSS". This was changed in July 2014 to bring the Academy in line with other British [[learned societies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academicians now 'Fellows of the Academy of Social Sciences'|url=http://acss.org.uk/news/academicians-now-fellows-academy-social-science/|website=News|publisher=Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=4 September 2014|date=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaign for Social Science ==
The Academy launched the [[Campaign for Social Science]] in January 2011 to advocate social science to Government and the general public. The Campaign is self-funded. It has campaigned for the restoration of the post of Government Chief Social Scientific Adviser,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/mar/19/the-case-for-a-chief-social-scientist Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; promotes social science in the media and on the web, and organises roadshows around the country to emphasise the value and importance of social science.

An '''application firewall''' is a form of [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] that controls [[input/output|input]], [[Output (computing)|output]], and/or [[System call|access]] from, to, or by an application or service. It operates by monitoring and potentially blocking the input, output, or [[System call|system service calls]] that do not meet the configured policy of the firewall. The application firewall is typically built to control all network traffic on any [[OSI model|OSI layer]] up to the [[OSI model#Layer 7: application layer|application layer]]. It is able to control applications or services specifically, unlike a [[Stateful firewall|stateful network firewall]], which is - without additional software - unable to control network traffic regarding a specific application. There are two primary categories of application firewalls, ''network-based application firewalls'' and ''host-based application firewalls''.

==Network-based application firewalls==
A network-based application layer firewall is a computer networking [[firewall (networking)|firewall]] operating at the [[application layer]] of a [[protocol stack]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Weakest Security Link Series|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yz34zXV7VB8C&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=application+layer+firewall#v=onepage&amp;q=application%20layer%20firewall&amp;f=false|author=Luis F. Medina|year=2003|page=54|isbn=978-0-595-26494-0|publisher=IUniverse}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also known as a proxy-based or reverse-proxy firewall. Application firewalls specific to a particular kind of network traffic may be titled with the service name, such as a [[web application firewall]]. They may be implemented through software running on a host or a stand-alone piece of network hardware. Often, it is a host using various forms of [[proxy server]]s to proxy traffic before passing it on to the client or server. Because it acts on the application layer, it may inspect the contents of traffic, blocking specified content, such as certain websites, viruses, or attempts to exploit known logical flaws in client software.

Modern application firewalls may also [[SSL acceleration|offload encryption from servers]], block application input/output from detected [[intrusion prevention|intrusions]] or [[Mangled packet|malformed communication]], manage or consolidate [[authentication]], or [[Data loss prevention products|block content that violates policies]].

===History===
[[Gene Spafford]] of [[Purdue University]], [[Bill Cheswick]] at [[AT&amp;T Laboratories]], and [[Marcus Ranum]] described a third generation firewall known as an application layer firewall. Marcus Ranum's work, based on the firewall created by Paul Vixie, Brian Reed and Jeff Mogul, spearheaded the creation of the first commercial product. The product was released by DEC, named the DEC SEAL by [[Geoff Mulligan]] - Secure External Access Link. DEC’s first major sale was on June 13, 1991 to a chemical company based on the East Coast of the USA.

Under a broader DARPA contract at TIS, Marcus Ranum, Wei Xu, and Peter Churchyard developed the Firewall Toolkit (FWTK), and made it freely available under license on October 1, 1993. The purposes for releasing the freely available, not for commercial use, FWTK were: to demonstrate, via the software, documentation, and methods used, how a company with (at the time) 11 years' experience in formal security methods, and individuals with firewall experience, developed firewall software; to create a common base of very good firewall software for others to build on (so people did not have to continue to "roll their own" from scratch); and to "raise the bar" of firewall software being used. However, FWTK was a basic application proxy requiring the user interactions.

In 1994, Wei Xu extended the FWTK with the Kernel enhancement of IP stateful filter and socket transparent. This was the first transparent firewall, known as the inception of [[Firewall (computing)#Third generation: application layer|the third generation firewall]], beyond a traditional application proxy ([[Firewall (computing)#Second generation: .22stateful.22 filters|the second generation firewall]]), released as the commercial product known as Gauntlet firewall. Gauntlet firewall was rated one of the top application firewalls from 1995 until 1998, the year it was acquired by Network Associates Inc, (NAI). Network Associates continued to claim that Gauntlet was the "worlds most secure firewall" but in May of 2000, security researcher [[Jim Stickley]] discovered a large vulnerability in the firewall, allowing remote access to the operating system and bypassing the security controls. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Hole found in NAI Firewall|url=https://www.securityfocus.com/news/40|author=Kevin Pulsen|date=May 22, 2000|accessdate=2018-08-14|publisher=securityfocus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jim Stickley|Stickley]] discovered a second vulnerability a year later, effectively ending Gauntlet firewalls security dominance.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaping hole in NAI's Gauntlet firewall|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/09/05/gaping_hole_in_nais_gauntlet/|author=Kevin Pulsen|date=September 5, 2001|accessdate=2018-08-14|publisher=theregister.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key benefit of application layer filtering is that it can "understand" certain applications and protocols (such as File Transfer Protocol, DNS, or web browsing), and it can detect whether an unwanted protocol is being sneaked through on a non-standard port or whether a protocol is being abused in any harmful way.

==Host-based application firewalls==
A host-based application firewall can monitor any application input, output, and/or system service calls made from, to, or by an application. This is done by examining information passed through system calls instead of or in addition to a network stack. A host-based application firewall can only provide protection to the applications running on the same host.

Application firewalls function by determining whether a process should accept any given connection. Application firewalls accomplish their function by hooking into socket calls to filter the connections between the application layer and the lower layers of the OSI model. Application firewalls that hook into socket calls are also referred to as socket filters. Application firewalls work much like a packet filter but application filters apply filtering rules (allow/block) on a per process basis instead of filtering connections on a per port basis. Generally, prompts are used to define rules for processes that have not yet received a connection. It is rare to find application firewalls not combined or used in conjunction with a packet filter.&lt;ref name="symantec.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/software-firewalls-made-straw-part-1-2|title=Software Firewalls: Made of Straw? Part 1 of 2|website=Symantec.com|publisher=Symantec Connect Community|date=2010-06-29|accessdate=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, application firewalls further filter connections by examining the process ID of data packets against a ruleset for the local process involved in the data transmission. The extent of the filtering that occurs is defined by the provided ruleset. Given the variety of software that exists, application firewalls only have more complex rulesets for the standard services, such as sharing services. These per process rulesets have limited efficacy in filtering every possible association that may occur with other processes. Also, these per process ruleset cannot defend against modification of the process via exploitation, such as memory corruption exploits.&lt;ref name="symantec.com"/&gt; Because of these limitations, application firewalls are beginning to be supplanted by a new generation of application firewalls that rely on mandatory access control (MAC), also referred to as [[sandbox (computer security)|sandboxing]], to protect vulnerable services. Examples of next generation host-based application firewalls that control system service calls by an application are [[AppArmor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Firewall your applications with AppArmor | url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/58789 | accessdate=2010-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the TrustedBSD MAC framework (sandboxing) in Mac OS X.&lt;ref name="TrustedBSD"&gt;{{cite web| title=The TrustedBSD Project | publisher=[[The TrustedBSD Project]] | url=http://www.trustedbsd.org/mac.html | date=2008-11-21 | accessdate=2010-02-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100123225944/http://www.trustedbsd.org/mac.html| archivedate= 23 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Host-based application firewalls may also provide network-based application firewalling.

Sandboxing systems can also control file and process accesses as well as network access. Commercial sandboxing systems are available for both Windows and Unix type OSes.

==Implementations==
There are various application firewalls available, including both free and open source software and commercial products.

===Mac OS X===
Mac OS X, as of Leopard, includes an implementation of the TrustedBSD MAC framework, which is taken from FreeBSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trustedbsd.org/mac.html|title=Mandatory Access Control (MAC) Framework|publisher=TrustedBSD|accessdate=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TrustedBSD MAC framework is used to sandbox some services, such as mDNSresponder, much like AppArmor is used to sandbox services in some Linux distributions. The TrustedBSD MAC framework provides a default layer of firewalling given the default configuration of the sharing services in Mac OS X Leopard and Snow Leopard.

The Application firewall located in the security preferences of Mac OS X starting with Leopard provides the functionality of this type of firewall to a limited degree via the use of code signing apps added to the firewall list. For the most part, this Application firewall only manages network connections by checking to see if incoming connections are directed toward an app in the firewall list and applies the rule (block/allow) specified for those apps.

===Linux===
This is a list of security software packages for Linux, allowing filtering of application to OS communication, possibly on a by-user basis:
* [[Kerio Control]] - a commercial Product
* [[AppArmor]]
* [[ModSecurity]] - also works under Windows, Mac OS X, [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and other versions of [[Unix]]. ModSecurity is designed to work with the web-servers IIS, Apache2 and NGINX.
* [[Systrace]]
* [[Zorp firewall|Zorp]]

===Windows===
* [[WinGate]]

===Network appliances===
These devices are sold as hardware network appliances and in some instances as virtual images that run on basic server hardware.

==Specialized application firewalls==
Specialized application firewalls offer a rich feature-set in protecting and controlling a specific application. Most specialized network appliance application firewalls are for web applications.

===History===
Large-scale web server hacker attacks, such as the 1996 PHF CGI exploit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1996-06.html|publisher=[[CERT Coordination Center]]|title=CERT Advisory CA-1996-06 Vulnerability in NCSA/Apache CGI example code|date=March 20, 1996|accessdate=2010-11-17|author=CERT}}&lt;/ref&gt; lead to the investigation into security models to protect web applications. This was the beginning of what is currently referred to as the web application firewall (WAF) technology family. Early entrants in the market started appearing in 1999, such as [[Perfecto Technologies]]’s [[AppShield]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New tool blocks wily e-comm hacker tricks|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9909/07/ecomm.hack.idg/index.html|author=Ellen Messmer|date=September 7, 1999|accessdate=2010-11-17|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; (who later changed their name to [[Sanctum (company)|Sanctum]] and in 2004 was acquired by Watchfire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/95035/Q_A_Watchfire_CTO_sees_Sanctum_acquisition_as_a_good_fit|title=Q&amp;A: Watchfire CTO sees Sanctum acquisition as a good fit|date=August 4, 2004|author=Jaikumar Vijayan|publisher=[[Computerworld]]|accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (acquired by IBM in 2007), which focused primarily on the ecommerce market and protected against illegal web page character entries. NetContinuum (acquired by [[Barracuda Networks]] in 2007) approached the issue by providing pre-configured ‘security servers’. Such pioneers faced proprietary rule-set issues, business case obstacles and cost barriers to wide adoption, however, the need for such solutions was taking root.

In 2002, the open source project [[ModSecurity]], run by Thinking Stone and later acquired by Breach Security in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/security-central/breach-security-acquires-rival-firewall-modsecurity-998|title=Breach Security acquires rival firewall ModSecurity|author=Jeremy Kirk|publisher=[[InfoWorld]]|date=September 25, 2006|accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; was formed with a mission to solve these obstacles and make WAF technology accessible for every company. With the release of the core rule set, a unique{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} open source rule set for protecting Web applications, based on the [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] Web Application Security Technical Committee’s (WAS TC) vulnerability work, the market had a stable, well documented and standardized model to follow.

In 2003, the WAS TC’s work was expanded and standardized across the industry through the work of the Open Web Application Security Project’s (OWASP) Top 10 List. This annual ranking is a classification scheme for web security vulnerabilities, a model to provide guidance for initial threat, impact, and a way to describe conditions that can be used by both assessment and protection tools, such as a WAF. This list would go on to become the industry benchmark for many compliance schemes.

In 2004, large traffic management and security vendors, primarily in the network layer space, entered the WAF market through a flurry of mergers and acquisitions. Key among these was the mid-year move by F5 to acquire Magnifire WebSystems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=F5 buys Magnifire for $29 million|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2004/0601f5buys.html|author=Tim Greene|publisher=[[Network World]]|date=June 1, 2004|accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the integration of the latter’s TrafficShield software solution with the former’s Big-IP traffic management system. This same year, F5 acquired AppShield and discontinued the technology. Further consolidation occurred in 2006 with the acquisition of Kavado by Protegrity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protegrity acquires Web apps security vendor Kavado|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/104063/Protegrity_acquires_Web_apps_security_vendor_Kavado|author=Linda Rosencrance|date=August 19, 2005|publisher=[[Computerworld]]|accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Citrix Systems’ buying of Teros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citrix Picks Up Teros|url=http://www.networkcomputing.com/cloud-storage/citrix-picks-up-teros.php|author=James Rogers|date=November 15, 2005|accessdate=2011-12-06|publisher=networkcomputing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until this point, the WAF market was dominated by niche providers who focused on web application layer security. Now the market was firmly directed at integrating WAF products with the large network technologies – load balancing, application servers, network firewalls, etc. – and began a rush of rebranding, renaming and repositioning the WAF. Options were confusing, expensive and still hardly understood by the larger market.

In 2006, the Web Application Security Consortium was formed to help make sense of the now widely divergent WAF market. Dubbed the Web Application Firewall Evaluation Criteria project (WAFEC), this open community of users, vendors, academia and independent analysts and researchers created a common evaluation criterion for WAF adoption that is still maintained today.

Wide-scale interest in the WAF began in earnest, tied to the 2006 [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard|PCI Security Standards Council]] formation and compliance mandate. Major [[payment card]] brands (AMEX, Visa, MasterCard, etc.) formed PCI as a way to regulate security practices across the industry and curtail the rampant [[credit card fraud]] taking place.  In particular, this standard mandated that all web applications must be secure, either through secure development or use of a WAF (requirement 6.6). The OWASP Top 10 forms the backbone of this requirement.

With the increased focus on virtualization and Cloud computing to maximize existing resources, scaling of WAF technology has become the most recent milestone.

By 2010, the WAF market had matured to a market exceeding $200M in size according to Forrester.  In a February 2010 report, Web Application Firewall: 2010 And Beyond, Forrester analyst Chenxi Wang wrote, "Forrester estimates the 2009 market revenue of the WAF+ market to be nearly $200 million, and the market will grow by a solid 20% in 2010. Security and risk managers can expect two WAF trends in 2010: 1) midmarket-friendly WAFs will become available, and 2) larger enterprises will gravitate toward the increasingly prevalent WAF+ solutions."  She also wrote that "[[Imperva]] is the stand alone WAF leader."

====Distributed web application firewalls====
Distributed Web Application Firewall (also called a dWAF) is a member of the web application firewall (WAF) and [[Web Application Security|Web applications security]] family of technologies. Purely software-based, the dWAF architecture is designed as separate components able to physically exist in different areas of the network. This advance in architecture allows the resource consumption of the dWAF to be spread across a network rather than depend on one appliance, while allowing complete freedom to scale as needed. In particular, it allows the addition / subtraction of any number of components independently of each other for better resource management. This approach is ideal for large and distributed virtualized infrastructures such as private, public or hybrid cloud models.

====Cloud-based web application firewalls====
Cloud-based web application firewall is also member of the web application firewall (WAF) and [[web Application Security|web applications security]] family of technologies. This technology is unique due to the fact that it is platform agnostic and does not require any hardware or software changes on the host.  All providers but one require a DNS change, wherein all web traffic is routed through the WAF where it is inspected and threats are thwarted. Cloud-based WAFs are typically centrally orchestrated, which means that threat detection information is shared among all the tenants of the service. This collaboration results in improved detection rates and lower false positives. Like other cloud-based solutions, this technology is elastic, scalable and is typically offered as a pay-as-you grow service. This approach is ideal for cloud-based web applications and small or medium-sized websites that require web application security but are not willing or able to make software or hardware changes to their systems.

Confiscationsrescript ihm beigemessenen atheistischen Aeußerungen. Eine Schrift, die man zu lesen bittet, ehe man sie confsicirt&lt;!--[sic]--&gt;," 1799).]]

The '''atheism dispute''' ({{lang-de|Atheismusstreit}}) was an event in German cultural history that lasted between 1798–1800 which had an effect on the [[German philosophy]] of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century.

== History ==
In 1798, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] was accused of [[atheism]] after publishing that year his essay "Ueber&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; den Grund unsers Glaubens an eine göttliche Weltregierung" ("On the Ground of Our Belief in a Divine World-Governance") which he had written in response to [[Friedrich Karl Forberg]]'s essay "Development of the Concept of Religion" in his ''Philosophical Journal''.  Forberg had claimed that unbelievers could be moral if they act as if an all-seeing and punishing God exists. In his brief essay, Fichte attempted to sketch some of his preliminary ideas on [[philosophy of religion]] formulated within his ''[[Wissenschaftslehre (Fichte)|Wissenschaftslehre]]'' (doctrine of science). He characterized God as the living moral order of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Fichte, Johann Gottlieb|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“On the Ground of Our Belief in a Divine World-Governance” provoked the publication of an anonymous essay that accused both Fichte and Forberg of atheism and called for Fichte's dismissal from his post at the [[University of Jena]]. In the wake of the dispute, many essays were published in defense and against Fichte, as well as defense by Fichte himself. [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] eventually published his famous open letter to Fichte, which saw the first use of the word [[nihilism]], and in which he equated philosophy in general and Fichte's transcendental philosophy in particular with "nihilism."

This dispute caused German authorities to suppress the original essay as well as threaten the University of Jena itself with preventing enrollment. Fichte was forced to resign his position at Jena and to flee to [[Berlin]] as a result of previously made statements in which he threatened to resign if he were subjected to official government reprimand.

The '''Bachelor of Accountancy''', also known as '''Bachelor of Accounting''', is the principal [[academic degree]] in [[accountancy]] in several countries, and is often the only (undergraduate) degree recognised for subsequent practice as a [[professional accountant]]; see [[First professional degree]]. It is abbreviated as '''B.Acy.''', '''B.Acc.''', or '''B. Accty.'''. It is also sometimes titled '''Bachelor of Accounting Science''' (B.Acc.Sci.) or "Baccalaureus [[WIKT:computatio#Latin|Computationis]]" (B.Compt.).&lt;!--  or "Baccalaureus [[WIKT:ratio#Latin|Rationum]]" (B.Rat.). --&gt;

The B.Acy. is extremely specialized: the [[curriculum]] requires study sufficient for professional practice (often at the [[academic major|major-level]]) in [[financial accounting]], [[management accounting]], [[auditing]], ''and'' [[taxation]]. The curriculum also includes  intermediate coursework in [[business law]] and [[economics]], and general coverage of [[management|management theory]], and [[business mathematics]] and [[Business statistics|-statistics]]. The degree is thus not to be confused with a [[Bachelor of Business Administration#Program content|B.B.A. in Accounting]] or [[Bachelor of commerce#Areas of study|B.Com. in Accounting]], which are general business degrees with accounting as an area of concentration; for discussion, see {{section link|Business education|Undergraduate education}}. Some programs allow for specializations in topics such as [[Tax accounting in the United States|Tax Accountancy]], Auditing  or [[Forensic accounting|Forensic Accountancy]].

Due to the specialised nature of the B.Acy., it is a professional degree course that is offered infrequently. In the [[United States]], it is likely to be a four-year undergraduate degree. In other parts of the world, such as [[Singapore]], it will be a three-year [[undergraduate]] degree. In [[Malta]], it is a two-year course that can be taken after qualifying in [[Bachelor of Commerce]] only for students who obtain exceptional grades in their previous course. Most [[List of universities in South Africa#Public universities|public universities in South Africa]] offer the degree or a variant, often as a [[Bachelor of Commerce#Honours Bachelor of Commerce|postgraduate Honours degree]].

After completion of the Bachelor of Accountancy, students typically go on to work as accountants in industry, and/or pursue [[professional accountant]] status. When the degree is recognized for this purpose, graduates will therefore pursue the [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] or [[Chartered Accountant|C.A.]] (or other) designations, and thus take up [[Articled clerk|"articles"]] at an [[:Category:Accounting firms|accounting firm]] accredited for training, so as to meet the relevant [[Certified Public Accountant#Work experience requirement|work experience requirements]], and will then also sit the associated [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination|Professional Examination]].

Note that in the [[United States]], a bachelor's degree in accountancy is generally not sufficient for practice as a [[professional accountant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nasba.org/education/becomingacpa/ Becoming a CPA], [[National Association of State Boards of Accountancy|nasba.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://community.thiswaytocpa.com/allgroups/exam-and-licensure/b/articles/archive/2012/12/28/licensure-checklist.aspx The basic things you need before they’ll crown you CPA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408215011/https://community.thiswaytocpa.com/allgroups/exam-and-licensure/b/articles/archive/2012/12/28/licensure-checklist.aspx |date=2014-04-08 }}, thiswaytocpa.com&lt;/ref&gt; Also, employers in industry generally prefer to hire applicants with a master's in accountancy (or an [[Master of Business Administration|M.B.A.]] with a concentration in accounting) and/or with professional certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Become an Accountant or Auditor|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Business-and-Financial/Accountants-and-auditors.htm#tab-4|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accountancy graduates intending to work as accountants will therefore commence with the [[Master of Accountancy]]; an accelerated program, or an advanced program allowing for specialized / additional elective work, is typically available to these students.&lt;ref&gt;eg.

'''Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre''' (formerly the '''Bamfield Marine Station''') is a [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] research station established in 1972, located in [[Bamfield, British Columbia|Bamfield, Barkley Sound, British Columbia]] and run by the [[University of Victoria]], the [[University of British Columbia]], [[Simon Fraser University]], the [[University of Alberta]], and the [[University of Calgary]].  The Centre hosts numerous public education programs in marine related science. BC Field Trips organizes many instructional and educational programs for school-aged children at the Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bcfieldtrips.ca/users/bamfield-marine-sciences-centre|title=Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre|website=BC Field Trips|language=en|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre also runs courses for [[university]] students during the summer (May to late August or early September) and during the fall (September to mid-December) through their affiliated universities.

The Centre is housed in the original building used as the western terminus of the British Empire's worldwide undersea cable called the [[All Red Line]].  Originally the site of the Pacific Cable Board (PCB) Cable Station, which served as the eastern terminus of the trans-Pacific [[telegraph]] cable linking [[Canada]] to [[Tabuaeran|Fanning Island]] (1,600 kilometres south of [[Hawaii]]).  The telegraph cable operated from 1901 to 1959.

The Centre also lends continued logistical support for [[Folger Passage]] and [[Barkley Sound]] with [[Ocean Networks Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oceannetworks.ca/about-us/funders-partners/partners/bamfield-marine-sciences-centre-bmsc|title=Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre (BMSC) {{!}} Ocean Networks Canada|website=www.oceannetworks.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre and the [[Huu-ay-aht First Nations]] partnered with the [[Hakai Institute]] to launch a drone. The drone took a series of photos, which were then used to map portions of the Barkley Sound area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hakai.org/blog/life-at-hakai/bamfield-you%E2%80%99ve-never-seen-it|title=Bamfield As You’ve Never Seen It Before {{!}} Hakai Institute|work=Hakai Institute|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2018, Dr. Sean Rogers, a biology instructor at the University of Calgary, was named director of the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre for a five-year term. Rogers has taught university courses at the Centre, and had been named acting director in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/utoday/issue/2018-06-19/biologist-sean-rogers-appointed-director-bamfield-marine-sciences-centre-five-year|title=Biologist Sean Rogers appointed director of Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre for five-year term|date=2018-06-18|work=UToday {{!}} University of Calgary|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4697">The '''United Nations Programme of Action on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States''', popularly referred to as the '''Barbados Program of Action''' ('''BPOA'''), is a policy document that both: comprehensively addresses the economic, environmental, and social developmental vulnerabilities facing islands; and outlines a strategy that seeks to mitigate those vulnerabilities. It remains the only internationally approved programme specific to [[Small Island Developing States]] (SIDS) which has been collectively and unanimously endorsed by SIDS.

== Development of the BPOA ==
The full text of the BPOA was produced in [[Bridgetown, Barbados]] in 1994 at the first Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island States, a conference mandated by United Nations [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] [[Resolution (law)|Resolution]] 47/189. The need for an islands specific conference was highlighted some two years prior at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ([[Earth Summit]]), held in [[Rio de Janeiro]] where 179 governments voted to adopt [[Agenda 21]]. Chapter 17, section G of [[Agenda 21]] acknowledges that "small island developing states are a special case both for environment and development ... [and] are considered extremely vulnerable to global warming and sealevel rise."

== BPOA+5 ==
In 1999, the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the UN held a special session to appraise five years of progress on the implementation of the BPOA (BPOA +5). The Assembly recognized progress as 'uneven' and identified key trends including increasing [[globalization]], widening inequalities in income and a continued deterioration of the global environment. A new General Assembly [[Resolution (law)|Resolution]] (S-22/2) promised further action.

== BPOA+10 ==
The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, agreed to at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] ([[Earth Summit 2002]]) affirmed UN commitment to 'full implementation' of Agenda 21, alongside achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]], the BPOA, and other international agreements. To this end, it recommended the convening of an International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Program of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. Upon receipt of the recommendation, the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the UN passed [[Resolution (law)|Resolutions]] 57/262 and 58/213, which mandated an International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States to take place. The meeting was held in [[Port Louis, Mauritius]] between January 10-14, 2005. The final report emerging from this meeting significantly revised the original BPOA, and verified what previous reviews were alluding to, that the implementation of the BPOA had been largely unsuccessful. What emerged from it was a reorganising of the Programs "priority areas" and an entrenched commitment to the notion that economic growth would ultimately contribute to sustainable development.

'''''Biblical Archaeology Review''''' is a bi-monthly [[magazine]] sometimes referred to as '''BAR''' that seeks to connect the academic study of [[archaeology]] to a broad general audience seeking to understand the world of the [[Bible]] and the Near and Middle East (Syro-Palestine and the [[Levant]]). Since its first issue in 1975,&lt;ref name=Reiss&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reiss|first1=Jana K.|title='Biblical Archaeology Review' Celebrates 40 Years with Retrospective Book|publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]]|date=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Biblical Archaeology Review'' has covered the latest discoveries and controversies in the archaeology of [[Israel]], [[Turkey]], [[Jordan]] and the surrounding regions as well as the newest scholarly insights into both the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[New Testament]]. The magazine is published by the [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational]] and [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[Biblical Archaeology Society]] and [[Editor-in-chief|editor]] Robert Cargill.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

From its founding in 1975 until 2017, the editor in chief was [[Hershel Shanks]]. After Shanks' retirement at the end of 2017, Robert R. Cargill was selected to be the editor of the publication.

The society also published ''[[Bible Review]]'' (1985–2005) and ''Archaeology Odyssey'', which merged with ''Biblical Archaeology Review'' after 2005.

'''Caking''' is a powder's tendency to form lumps or masses rather than flow smoothly.

Factors involved in the degree of caking include the substance's particle surface chemistry, particle size and [[particle-size distribution]], particle shape, and environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. Caking also depends on any pressure on the powdered substance, and how long the substance has been stored.

Physically, the caking process involves [[electrostatic attraction]] or the formation of weak [[chemical bond]]s between the particle surfaces. This gives the bulk substance the strength to crack and collapse abruptly, to form vertical surfaces, and so on.

Usually caking is undesirable, but is useful when pressing powdered substances into pills or [[briquette]]s. [[Granular material]]s can also be subject to caking, particularly those that are [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] such as salt, sugar, and many [[chemical fertilizer]]s, because of the effects of moisture on grain surfaces.

Caking properties must be considered when designing and constructing [[bulk material handling]] equipment. Powdered substances that need to be stored, and flow smoothly at some time in the future, are often [[pelletize]]d or made into [[pill (pharmacy)|pill]]s. [[Anti caking agent]]s are also commonly added to control caking.

The '''chameleon''' is a hypothetical [[scalar particle]] that couples to matter more weakly than gravity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sciencemag.org/physics/2015/08/tiny-fountain-atoms-sparks-big-insights-dark-energy  Tiny fountain of atoms sparks big insights into dark energy] by Adrian Cho on August 20, 2015. Published at the "American Association for the Advancement of Science"&lt;/ref&gt; postulated as a [[dark energy]] candidate.&lt;ref&gt;J Khoury and A. Weltman, Phys. Rev. D '''69''', 044026 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a non-linear self-interaction, it has a variable effective mass which is an increasing function of the ambient energy density—as a result, the range of the force mediated by the particle is predicted to be very small in regions of high density (for example on Earth, where it is less than 1mm) but much larger in low-density intergalactic regions: out in the cosmos chameleon models permit a range of up to several thousand [[parsecs]]. As a result of this variable mass, the hypothetical [[fifth force]] mediated by the chameleon is able to evade current constraints on [[equivalence principle]] violation derived from terrestrial experiments even if it couples to matter with a strength equal or greater than that of gravity. Although this property would allow the chameleon to drive the currently observed acceleration of the [[cosmic inflation|universe's expansion]], it also makes it very difficult to test for experimentally.

==Hypothetical properties==
Chameleon particles were proposed in 2003 by Khoury and Weltman.

In most theories, chameleons have a mass that scales as some power of the local energy density: &lt;math&gt;m_\text{eff} \sim \rho^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha \simeq 1&lt;/math&gt;.

Chameleons also couple to photons, allowing photons and chameleons to oscillate between each other in the presence of an external [[magnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Chameleons can be confined in hollow containers because their mass increases rapidly as they penetrate the container wall, causing them to reflect. One strategy to search experimentally for chameleons is to direct photons into a cavity, confining the chameleons produced, and then to switch off the light source. Chameleons would be indicated by the presence of an afterglow as they decay back into photons.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Steffen et al., "Constraints on chameleons and axion-like particles from the GammeV experiment" [https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.5070]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental searches==
A number of experiments have attempted to detect chameleons along with [[axions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The GammeV experiment&lt;ref&gt;[http://gammev.fnal.gov/ GammeV experiment at Fermilab]&lt;/ref&gt; is a search for axions, but has been used to look for chameleons too. It consists of a cylindrical chamber inserted in a 5 [[Tesla (unit)|T]] magnetic field. The ends of the chamber are glass windows, allowing light from a laser to enter and afterglow to exit.  GammeV set the limited coupling to photons in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Search for Chameleon Particles Using a Photon-Regeneration Technique|date = 22 Jan 2009|journal =  Physical Review Letters|accessdate = |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.030402|pmid = 19257328|arxiv = 0806.2438 |bibcode = 2009PhRvL.102c0402C |volume=102|issue = 3|pages = 030402|last1 = Chou|first1 = A.

==History==
The Copperbelt University is a Public University established through the Act of Parliament No. 19 of 1987. Prior to 1987, the University existed as a campus of the University of Zambia Federal System with two schools; namely: School of Business and Industrial Studies (SBIS) and School of Environmental Studies (SES). The campus was referred to as the University of Zambia at Ndola (UNZANDO) until 1 December 1987. As of 1 January 1989 the Zambia Institute of Technology (ZIT) was incorporated into the Copperbelt University to form the School of Technology. Since 1987, the University has significantly grown from only two faculties to ten by the end of 2013; it now provides very unique programmes that have not been replicated elsewhere. The total number of students in 2017 was 11,900 and having had over 54,000 students in the past 25 years. The University too is proud of its graduates who are holding key responsibilities in various sectors of the economy within the country and beyond. At its first graduation ceremony in 1992, the University had only 100 students then graduating from the various disciplines but graduating average of 1,500 as at 2017.

In 2014, the School of Medicine received US$1 million in donation from the [[Council of Zambian Jewry]],  of the [[African Jewish Congress]] and the [[World Jewish Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/14643/zambian_jews_support_one_of_zambia_s_medical_schools_with_a_generous_donation Zambian Jews support one of Zambia's medical schools with a generous donation], World Jewish Congress, April 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6975">[[Cultural identity]] refers to a person's sense of belonging to a particular [[culture]] or group.  This process involves learning about and accepting [[traditions]], [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], [[language]], [[religion]], [[ancestry]], [[aesthetics]], thinking patterns, and [[social structure]]s of a culture.  Normally, people internalize the beliefs, values, norms, and social practices of their culture and identify themselves with that culture.  The culture becomes a part of their [[self-concept]] (Lustig, 2013).  However, some studies have noted that existing cultural identity theory may not account for the fact that different individuals and groups may not react to or interpret events, happenings, attitudes, etc. in the same ways as other individuals or groups.

Myron Lustig notes that cultural identities are central to a person’s sense of self.  That is because cultural identities “are central, dynamic, and multifaceted components of one’s self concept” (Lustig, 133).  Lustig also points out that cultural identities are dynamic, and they exist within a changing social context.  As a result, a person’s identity changes as do one’s ongoing experiences in life (Lustig, 135).  Other researchers describe cultural identity as referring to the content of values as guiding principles, to meaningful symbols, and to life styles that individuals share with others, though not necessarily within recognizable groups (Boski et al., 2004).  In addition, Boski et al. point out that most books and studies have ignored cultural identity as a theoretical construct in the field of [[cross-cultural psychology]].  Instead, books and journals report works on the theme of social identity.  [[Social identity]] is described as a sense of “We-ness,” or attachment to a group that one is a member of, and by comparison to others.  The sense of “We-ness” remains culturally empty, however.  Even with natural groups, it is portrayed in trait-attributes, “which is not different from those used to characterize individuals” (Boski et al., 2004).  There is, however, research evidence about the social (ethnic) vs. cultural distinction (Sanchez-Burks et al., 2000).  This study found that the task-oriented cultural style was generally more favored than the task-plus interpersonal alternative, particularly among Anglo-American participants, for whom ethnicity did not matter.  Mexican and Latino participants, however, showed some degree of favoritism toward ethnically similar participants (Sanchez-Burks et all, 2000).

It seems that there are different viewpoints regarding cultural and social identities.  Cultural identity is defined as the identity of a group or culture or of an individual as far as one is influenced by one’s belonging to a group or culture.  Further, Cultural identity is similar to, and overlaps with, [[identity politics]].  New forms of identification have been suggested to break down the understanding of the individual as a whole subject into a collection of various cultural identifiers.  Such identifiers can result from various conditions including: location, gender, race, history, nationality, language, sexuality, religious beliefs, ethnicity, aesthetics, and even food.  In places like the U.S. and Canada, where the people are ethnically diverse, social unity is primarily based on common social values and beliefs.  However, some critics of cultural identity declare that cultural identity based upon difference is a divisive force in society.  In addition, cultural identity may be defined by the social network of people imitating and following the social norms as presented by the media.  Therefore, instead of learning behavior and knowledge from cultural or religious groups, people may be learning social norms from the media to build on their cultural identity.  Language may also be an important factor in culture identity.  The communication that comes with sharing a language promotes connections and roots to ancestors and cultural histories.

	When young people are severed from the ideals and positively sanctioned statuses, feelings of alienation or social isolation may develop.  These feelings can result in undesired treatment and status.  This process results in personal marginalization, and it may lead to social marginalization which includes that person’s relative economic, employment, educational, and cultural loss compared to those around him.  This provides a second source of alienation from mainstream society.  This can cause an individual to experience extreme discomfort called ego identity discomfort.  Because external sources have too much control, the individual cannot construct a personal definition of him/her self.  The person is then motivated to identify with an alternative social group such as a drug subcultural group.  Such groups provide opportunities to resolve identity problems.   Identification with such a group reduces the person’s ego identity discomfort, or it helps to solve identity problems.  Scholars today are focusing on the basic elements of social organization (race, ethnicity, gender, and social class) in their theory and research.  In the case of drug subcultures, it is reported that Anderson (1998) discovered that the composition of the drug subcultural groups differed between blacks and whites.  Blacks described neighborhood and school based groups as securing an improved social status and reputation.  On the other hand, Anderson (1998) found that the drug subcultural groups reported by whites differed.  These groups were located at nightclubs, bars, colleges, high schools and around the neighborhood.  Some of these groups were “other” activity oriented, such as college groups or the entertainment industry, and these groups had a “very strong” interest in drugs.  Whites reported using many different drugs, from alcohol and cocaine to marijuana and heroin.  These differences are significant, and such differences could alter the cultural identity theory. This is because different groups, such as blacks and whites, perceive events and problems in different ways.

'''Developmental disorders''' comprise a group of [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] conditions originating in childhood that involve serious impairment in different areas. There are several ways of using this term.&lt;ref name = Rutter3233&gt;{{cite book |url = http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405145498.html |title = Rutter's Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Fifth Edition |publisher = Blackwell Publishing Ltd |editors = Michael Rutter, Dorothy V.

Pine, Stephen Scott, Jim Stevenson, Eric Taylor, Anita Thapar |others = Dorothy Bishop and Michael Rutter |year = 2008 |pages = 32–33 |isbn = 978-1-4051-4549-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most narrow concept is used in the category "Specific Disorders of Psychological Development" in the [[ICD-10]].&lt;ref name = Rutter3233/&gt; These disorders comprise [[language disorder]]s, [[learning disorder]]s, [[Developmental coordination disorder|motor disorders]] and [[autism spectrum]] disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://priory.com/psych/ICD.htm|title=ICD 10|website=priory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In broader definitions [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] is included, and the term used is [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s.&lt;ref name = Rutter3233/&gt; Yet others include [[antisocial behavior]] and [[schizophrenia]] that begins in childhood and continues through life.&lt;ref name = Rutter3233/&gt; However, these two latter conditions are not as stable as the other developmental disorders, and there is not the same evidence of a shared genetic liability.&lt;ref name = Rutter3233/&gt;

Developmental disorders are present from early life. Most improve as the child grows older, but some entail impairments that continue throughout life. There is a strong genetic component; more males are afflicted than females.&lt;ref name = Rutter3233/&gt;

==Emergence==
Learning disabilities are diagnosed when the children are young and just beginning school. Most learning disabilities are found under the age of 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = National, Disabilities Learning | year = 1982 | title = Learning disabilities: Issues on definition | url = | journal = Asha | volume = 24 | issue = 11| pages = 945–947 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young children with communication disorders may not speak at all, or may have a limited vocabulary for their age.&lt;ref name="comm"&gt;Communication Disorders. (n.d.). Children's Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, WI, Retrieved December 6, 2011, from http://www.chw.org/display/PPF/DocID/&lt;/ref&gt; Some children with communication disorders have difficulty understanding simple directions or are unable to name objects.&lt;ref name="comm"/&gt; Most children with communication disorders are able to speak by the time they enter school, however, they continue to have problems with communication.&lt;ref name="comm"/&gt; School-aged children often have problems understanding and formulating words.&lt;ref name="comm"/&gt; Teens may have more difficulty with understanding or expressing abstract ideas.&lt;ref name="comm"/&gt;

=== Causes ===
The scientific study of the causes of developmental disorders involves many different theories. Some of the major differences between these theories involves whether or not environment disrupts normal development, or if abnormalities are pre-determined.&lt;ref name="Karmiloff Annette"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Karmiloff Annette | year = | title = Development itself is key to understanding developmental disorders | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661398012303 | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences| volume =  2| issue = | pages =  389–398| doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(98)01230-3 | pmid=21227254 | date=October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Normal development occurs with a combination of contributions from both the environment and genetics. The theories vary in the part each factor has to play in normal development, thus affecting how the abnormalities are caused.&lt;ref name="Karmiloff Annette"/&gt;

One theory that supports environmental causes of developmental disorders involves stress in early childhood. Researcher and child psychiatrist [[Bruce D. Perry|Bruce D. Perry, M.D., Ph.D]], theorizes that developmental disorders can be caused by early childhood traumatization.&lt;ref name="Perry, Bruce D 2006, p.2"&gt;Perry, Bruce D. and Szalavitz, Maia. "The Boy Who Was Raised As A Dog", Basic Books, 2006, p.2. {{ISBN|978-0-465-05653-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his works he compares developmental disorders in traumatized children to adults with post-traumatic stress disorder, linking extreme environmental stress to the cause of developmental difficulties.&lt;ref name="Perry, Bruce D 2006, p.2"/&gt; Other stress theories suggest that even small stresses can accumulate to result in emotional, behavioral, or social disorders in children.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Kim John. “Simplicity Parenting: Using the Extraordinary Power of Less to Raise Calmer, Happier, and More Secure Kids”, Ballantine Books, 2010, p. 9. {{ISBN|9780345507983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They estimated that about one in 300 children are born with spontaneous genetic mutations associated with rare developmental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-38691622|title=Child gene study identifies new developmental disorders|last=Walsh|first=Fergus|date=2017-01-25|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
===Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)===
====Diagnosis====
The first diagnosed case of ASD was published in 1943 by American psychiatrist [[Leo Kanner]].  There is a wide range of cases and severity to ASD so it is very hard to detect the first signs of ASD. A diagnosis of ASD can be made accurately before the child is 3 years old, but the diagnosis of ASD is not commonly confirmed until the child is somewhat older. The age of diagnosis can range from 9 months to 14 years, and the mean age is 4 years old in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.autismspeaks.org/science/science-news/hunting-autisms-earliest-clues|title=Hunting for Autism&amp;#039;s Earliest Clues|date=18 September 2013|website=Autism Speaks}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average each case of ASD is tested at three different diagnostic centers before confirmed. Early diagnosis of the disorder can diminish familial stress, speed up referral to special educational programs and influence family planning.&lt;ref name="Dereu, Mieke 2010"&gt;Dereu, Mieke. (2010). ''Screening for Autism Spectrum Disorders in Flemish Day-Care Centers with the Checklist for Early Signs of Developmental Disorders.'' Springer Science+Business Media. 1247-1258.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In the brain====
The cause of ASD is still uncertain. Autism spectrum disorder is a disorder of the cortex, which controls higher functions, sensation, muscle movements, and memory. What is known is that a child with ASD has a pervasive problem with how the brain is wired. The distribution of white matter, the nerve fibers that link diverse parts of the brain, is abnormal. An ASD child’s brain grows at a very rapid rate and is almost fully grown by the age of 10.&lt;ref name="Dereu, Mieke 2010"/&gt; Recent fMRI studies have also found altered connectivity within the social brain areas due to ASD and may be related to the social impairments encountered in ASD.&lt;ref name="Gotts et al"&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Brain |year=2012 |volume=135 |issue=9 |pages=2711-2725 |title= Fractionation of social brain circuits in autism spectrum disorders |author= Gotts S. J., Simmons W. K., Milbury L. A., Wallace G. L., Cox R. W., Martin A. |pmid= 22791801|doi=10.1093/brain/aws160 |pmc=3437021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Subbaraju et al"&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=European Journal of Neuroscience|year=2017 |title= Identification of lateralized compensatory neural activities within the social brain due to autism spectrum disorder in adolescent males |author= Subbaraju V, Sundaram S, Narasimhan S |doi=10.1111/ejn.13634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Symptoms====
Still a lot of information is unclear about ASD and the symptoms have a wide range of severity. Signs include impairments in social interactions, communication and repetitive or restricted patterns of interest or behaviors. There are also different symptoms at different ages based on developmental milestones. Children between 0 and 36 months with ASD show a lack of eye contact, seem to be deaf, lack a social smile, do not like being touched or held, have unusual sensory behavior and show a lack of imitation. Children between 12 and 24 months with ASD show a lack of gestures, prefer to be alone, do not point to objects to indicate interest, are easily frustrated with challenges, and lack of functional play. And finally children between the ages 24 to 36 months with ASD show a lack of symbolic play and an unusual interest in certain objects, or moving objects.&lt;ref name="Dereu, Mieke 2010"/&gt;

====Treatment====
There is no cure for ASD and proper treatment depends on the case and what is most struggled with. Autism spectrum disorder is like many other disorders where when diagnosed early, can be better treated. Different types of therapy are helpful such as music therapy and physical therapy. Other treatments include [[auditory integration training|auditory training]], discrete trial training, [[facilitated communication]], and [[sensory integration therapy]].&lt;ref name="Dereu, Mieke 2010"/&gt;

===Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)===
[[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] is a [[neurodevelopmental disorder]] that is characterised by significant levels of hyperactivity, inattentiveness, and impulsiveness. There are three subtypes of ADHD: predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive, and combined (which presents as both hyperactive and inattentive subtypes).&lt;ref name="Tresco Katy E. 2004"&gt;Tresco, Katy E. (2004). ''Attention Deficit Disorders: School-Based Interventions.'' Pennsylvania: Bethlehem.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treatment options====
Treatment of ADHD often includes a combination of psychological, behavioural, pharmaceutical and educational advice and interventions.

Medications commonly used in the treatment of ADHD are primarily [[stimulant]]s such as [[methylphenidate]] and [[lisdexamphetamine]] and non-stimulants such as [[atomoxetine]].

[[SSRI]] antidepressants may be unhelpful, and could worsen symptoms of ADHD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

 | year = 1997
 | month = 
 | pmid = 9418743
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However ADHD is often misdiagnosed as depression, particularly when no hyperactivity is present.

====Symptoms====
Symptoms of ADHD include inattentiveness, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity. Many of the behaviors that are associated with ADHD include poor control over actions resulting in disruptive behavior and academic problems. Another area that is affected by these disorders is the social arena for the person with the disorder. Many children that have this disorder exhibit poor interpersonal relationships and struggle to fit in socially with their peers.&lt;ref name="Tresco Katy E. 2004"/&gt;

A '''Discourse-Completion Task''' (DCT) is a tool used in [[linguistics]] and [[pragmatics]] to elicit particular [[speech acts]].  A DCT consists of a one-sided role play containing a situational prompt which a participant will read to elicit the responses of another participant.

==Background==
The instrument was originally developed by [[Shoshana Blum-Kulka]] for studying speech act realization comparatively between native and non-native Hebrew speakers, based on the work of E. Levenston.&lt;ref name="blum"&gt;Blum-Kulka, S., House, J., &amp; G. Kasper. (1989). Investigating cross-cultural pragmatics: An introductory overview. In Blum-Kulka, S., House, J., &amp; G. Kasper (Eds.), Cross-cultural pragmatics: Requests and apologies (pp. 1-34). Norwood, NJ: Ablex, p. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

DCTs are used in pragmatics research to study speech acts and find the medium between naturally occurring speech and scripted speech acts.  In comparing role-plays to DCTs, role-plays are considered to elicit data more similar to naturally occurring speech acts,&lt;ref&gt;Gass, S., &amp; Houck, N. (1999). Interlanguage refusals: a cross-cultural study of Japanese English. Walter de Gruyet, pp. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golato, A. (2003). Studying compliment responses: A comparison of DCTs and recordings of natu-
rally occurring talk. Applied Linguistics, 24(1), 90–121.&lt;/ref&gt; yet are considered harder to score, attributed to the influence of the interlocutors.&lt;ref&gt;Roever, C. (2011). Testing of second language pragmatics: Past and future. Language testing (0265-5322), 28 (4), p. 468&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
A discourse-completion task consists of scripted dialogue representing various scenarios, preceded by a short prompt describing the setting and situation.&lt;ref name="blum" /&gt; The prompt usually includes information on social distance between participants and pre-event background to help the participant construct the scenarios.

'''EcoHealth''' is an emerging field of study researching how changes in the earth’s [[ecosystems]] affect human health. It has many prospects. EcoHealth examines changes in the biological, physical, social and economic environments and relates these changes to human health. Examples of these changes and their effects abound. Common examples include increases in [[asthma]] rates due to [[air pollution]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] contamination of [[game fish]] in the [[Great Lakes]] of the [[United States]], and [[habitat fragmentation]] leading to increasing rates of [[Lyme disease]].

Recently [[virulent]] new [[infectious diseases]] such as [[SARS]], [[Ebola virus]], [[Nipah virus]], [[H5N1|bird flu]] and [[hantavirus]] have all been found to result from ecosystem change created by humans.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} These diseases have high death rates and very few effective therapies.

EcoHealth is bringing together [[physicians]], [[veterinarians]], [[ecologists]], [[economists]], [[social scientists]], [[urban planner|planners]] and others to study and understand how ecosystem changes affect human health. EcoHealth strives to provide innovative, practical solutions to reduce or reverse the negative health effects of ecosystem change.

==History==

Ecosystem approaches to health, or ecohealth, emerged as a defined field of inquiry and application in the 1990s, primarily through the global research supported by the [[International Development Research Centre]] in Ottawa (IDRC), Canada (Lebel, 2003). However, this was a resurrection of an approach to health and ecology that can be traced back, in Western societies, to [[Hippocrates]], and to much earlier eras in Eastern societies. The approach was prominent among many scientists in the 18th and 19th centuries, but fell into disfavour in the twentieth century, when technical professionalism and expertise were assumed to be sufficient to deal with health and disease. In this relatively brief era, evaluation of the negative human health impacts of environmental change (both the natural and built environment) was allotted to the fields of medicine and environmental health. One medicine, as championed by scholars and practitioners such as Calvin Schwabe, was largely considered a marginal activity.

Integrated approaches to health and ecology re-emerged in the 1990s, and included one health, conservation medicine, ecological resilience, ecological integrity, health communities, and a variety of other approaches. These new movements were able to draw on a tradition that stretches from Hippocrates, to [[Rudolf Virchow]] and [[Louis Pasteur]], who did not recognize the boundaries between human and animal medicine, and environmental and social change; to William Osler, who was a member of both the [[McGill University Faculty of Medicine|McGill medical faculty]] and the [[Université de Montréal Faculty of Veterinary Medicine|Montreal Veterinary College]]; Calvin Schwabe, whose 1984 book, Veterinary Medicine and Human Health, is a classic in the field; and [[James Harlan Steele|James Steele]], who founded the first veterinary public health unit in the United States.

Ecohealth approaches as currently practiced are participatory, systems-based approaches to understanding and promoting health and wellbeing in the context of social and ecological interactions. What differentiates these approaches from earlier integrative attempts is a firm grounding in complexity theories and post-normal science (Waltner-Toews, 2004; Waltner-Toews ''et al.'', 2008). While a variety of organizations promote integrative approaches such as One Health, the primary funder and promoter of ecohealth in particular, world-wide, is the International Development Research Centre in Ottawa (http://www.idrc.ca/ecohealth/).

After a decade of international conferences in North America and Australia under the more contentious umbrella of "[[ecosystem health]]", the first "ecosystem approach to human health" (ecohealth) forum was held in Montreal in 2003, followed by conferences and forums in Wisconsin, U.S., and Mérida, Mexico, all with major support from IDRC. Since then the International Association for Ecology and Health, and the journal Ecohealth have established the field as a legitimate scholarly and development activity (www.ecohealth.net).

==Differences==

EcoHealth studies differ from traditional, single discipline studies. A traditional epidemiological study may show increasing rates of malaria in a region, but not address how or why the rate is increasing. An environmental health study may recommend the spraying of a pesticide in certain amounts in certain areas to reduce spread. An economic analysis may calculate the cost and effectiveness per dollar spent on such a program.
An EcoHealth study uses a different approach. It brings the multiple specialist disciplines together with members of the affected community before the study begins. Through pre-study meetings the group shares knowledge and adopts a common language. These pre-study meetings often lead to creative and novel approaches and can lead to a more "socially robust" solution. EcoHealth practitioners term this synergy transdisciplinarity, and differentiate it from multidiscipline studies.
EcoHealth studies also value participation of all involved groups, including decision makers and believe issues of equity (between gender, socioeconomic classes, age and even species) are important to fully understand the problem to be studied.
Jean Lebel (2003) phrased ''transdisciplinarity, participation and equity the three pillars of EcoHealth'' (Lebel, 2003). 
The IDRC now speaks of six principles, instead of three pillars, namely transdisciplinarity, participation, gender and social equity, system-thinking, sustainability and research-to-action (Charron, 2011).

==Examples==

A short example of a transdisciplinary study in the field of EcoHealth appears below. This is excerpted from HEALTH: An Ecosystem Approach, by Jean Lebel. (IDRC 2003, {{ISBN|1-55250-012-8}}.)
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“In Mexico in the 1940s and 1950s, close to 24 000 of the 2.4 million people who caught malaria every year died as a result. Massive use of the powerful insecticide DDT was the linchpin of the government's effort to eradicate the disease. Over time, some progress was made against malaria, but the war was far from won. The use of DDT also posed its own threats to the health of the ecosystem. Moreover, as required by the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico had to completely eliminate the use of DDT by 2002.
To meet this challenge, an EcoHealth research project was set up to pool the knowledge of a team of specialists in epidemiology, computer science, entomology, and social sciences, from both government and academia.
This team has accumulated volumes of information about the prevalence of malaria in 2 000 villages. Data from powerful geographical information systems enabled them to conclude that mosquitoes do not travel very much. "If you have a place to lay your eggs and feed yourself, why go elsewhere?" explains Mario Henry Rodriguez, Director of Research on Infectious Diseases at the National Institute for Public Health (NIPH). In addition, as confirmed by Juan Eugenio Hernández, NIPH's Director of Informatics, it is now believed that "human beings are the vectors of malaria," which explains why more cases of malaria are found in villages located alongside roads.”
With community help, the team studied the population's living conditions, including behavioural differences between men and women. It was found that while women are more likely to be bitten by mosquitoes early in the morning when they go to fetch water, the men are likely to be bitten in the coffee plantations at night.
Several preventive actions have been taken. The scientists have proposed a new insecticide that, unlike DDT, does not persist in the environment. They have also developed a more effective pump that can spray 40 homes a day instead of 8, and uses less insecticide. A new malaria testing kit now detects the presence or absence of parasites in a patient's blood in only a few minutes, unlike laboratory tests that take three to four weeks to confirm a diagnosis. Previously, the need to wait for test results forced the authorities to treat everyone who showed vague symptoms of the illness, such as a high fever or headaches. Now, volunteers administer these tests to the people in close to 60 villages. "We have given communities the means to take care of themselves," says Mario Rodriguez.
The fight against malaria in Mexico is now no longer solely the responsibility of government employees. Women also play a role by removing, every two weeks, the algae that harbour mosquito larvae in bodies of water. As a result, the number of cases of malaria in the state of Oaxaca has dropped from 15 000 in 1998 to only 400 today — and all without using any DDT. "Our experience has taught us that we need to bolster the social science research component if we want to extend this program to other parts of the country, while maintaining it in Oaxaca. The challenge is to draw the lessons that will lead to application of the program on a much wider scale," says Dr Rodriguez.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This study reveals both the nature of the complex interactions of the problem and the extent to which a successful solution must cross research disciplines. The solution involved creative thinking on the part of many individuals, and produced a win-win situation for researchers, business and most importantly, for the community. 
Although many of the dramatic effects of ecosystem change and much of the research is focused in developing countries, the ecosystem of the built environment in urban areas of the developed world is also a major determinant of human health. Obesity, diabetes, asthma, and heart disease are all directly related to how humans interact with the local [[urban ecosystem]] in which they live. Urban design and planning determine car use, food choices available, air pollution levels and the safety and walkability of the neighborhoods in which people live.
Other examples of the EcoHealth approach can be found in Linking Social and Ecological Systems: Management Practice and Social Mechanisms for Building Resilience, edited by Fikrit Berkes and Carl Folke (1998, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-59140-6}}) and Panarchy: Understanding Transformations in Human and Natural Systems, edited by Lance H. Gunderson and C. S. Holling (2002, Island Press, {{ISBN|1-55963-856-7}}).

==EcoHealth 101: education for ecosystem approaches==

Courses in ecosystem approaches to health have been developed and delivered in several [[North America]]n and [[Australia]]n universities. One innovative Canadian course involved a collaboration of all of Canada's veterinary colleges, and focused on integrative field cases in all parts of the country; another Canadian course was a joint effort of the medical school at the University of Western Ontario and the Ontario Veterinary College at the University of Guelph. In the years after 2003, communities of practice for ecosystem approaches to health in [[Canada]], Latin America and the Caribbean, and [[Africa]] (largely supported by the IDRC) created intensive graduate level courses that integrated systems approaches with participatory approaches, and used actual case studies so that students gained applied clinical experience in "transdisciplinary" problem solving (see www.copeh-canada.org for one example). CoPEH-Canada organizes a yearly professional development and graduate level intensive training course in ecosystem approaches to health and have created a teaching manual with much of their material which is free on their site in English, French and Spanish (www.copeh-canada.org).

Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the University of Wisconsin–Madison created a website to promote education in this area [http://www.ecohealth101.org EcoHealth (Environmental Change and Our Health)]. The website examines the changes that are transforming Earth and what they can mean for our health.

This website is geared to middle-school students and their teachers, and delivers scientific information in a kid-friendly, engaging, and visually vibrant manner. Since its initial partnership with the Journey to Planet Earth television mini-series, hosted and narrated by actor Matt Damon and aired on PBS in Spring 2003 and 2004, the website has become an educational complement to this [[television|TV]] series, as well as a dynamic stand-alone tool for students and teachers. Since then, the site's appeal has grown far broader, reaching high-school students, and anyone interested in environmental and health issues—or simply wanting a reliable and fun resource for being able to sort the science from the sound bites. [http://www.ecohealth101.org EcoHealth 101] provides the in-depth analysis and context behind today's headline news.

"The idea for the site grew from the positive feedback following public lectures I've given on global environmental health", says Dr. Jonathan Patz, associate professor at the University of Wisconsin &amp; adjunct associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "'Students should really learn about how their health is tied so closely to the global environment,' was the comment I often heard."

"The site is very exciting because it deals with serious and thought-provoking topics", adds Dr. Patz. "Nonetheless, it shows middle-school students how to have fun with the visual elements and discover what potential solutions exist for alleviating the negative effects of climate change and other changes to our planet."

In a rapidly changing world, our school curriculum must expand to include accurate science on global warming, environmental degradation, and its negative effects on human, wildlife and [[ecosystem health]]. The mission of [http://www.ecohealth101.org EcoHealth 101] is to educate and inform the next generation of leaders who may have the answers to today's problems. Chapters from the website include Global Warming, Stratospheric Ozone Depletion, The Balance of Nature, Modern Agriculture and Drinking Water, and Globalization and Disease Without Borders.

The site was reviewed for accuracy and fairness by science, health, and environmental experts in a wide range of specialties.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5004">{{Dormancy}}
'''Delayed implantation''' or '''embryonic diapause''' is a [[Reproduction|reproductive]] strategy used by approximately 100 different [[mammal]]s in seven or eight different [[order (biology)|orders]].  In embryonic diapause, the [[embryo]] ([[blastocyst]]) does not immediately implant in the [[uterus]] after [[sexual reproduction]] has created the [[zygote]], but is maintained in a state of [[dormancy]].  Little to no development takes place while the embryo remains unattached to the uterine wall.  As a result, the normal [[gestation]] period is extended for a species-specific time.&lt;ref name="lope"&gt;

While much of the molecular regulation involved in activating dormant blastocysts has been characterized, little is still known about entry into diapause, and the conditions which enable a blastocyst to remain dormant.

Some mammals that undergo embryonic diapause include [[rodent]]s, [[bear]]s, [[mustelid]]s (e.g. [[weasel]]s and [[badger]]s), and [[marsupial]]s, (e.g. [[kangaroo]]s).  Some groups only have one species that undergoes embryonic diapause, such as the [[roe deer]] in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Artiodactyla]].&lt;ref name="ren" /&gt;

== Purpose ==

Mammals may undergo diapause to avoid the risk to their own lives during unfavourable and/or environmental conditions. 
Mammals use embryonic diapause to time the [[birth]] of their [[offspring]] for favorable [[metabolic]] and/or environmental conditions.  [[Reproduction]] has a large energy cost and it is beneficial to have ideal conditions (e.g. available food, mild weather, previous offspring [[weaned]]) to ensure the [[offspring]] survives before giving birth.&lt;ref&gt;

== Types ==

Two types of mammalian embryonic diapause have been identified.

=== Facultative diapause ===

Facultative diapause is also known as lactational delayed implantation due to its regulation via [[lactation]].  If a female [[copulate]]s while still lactating for a previous litter, the suckling stimulus will cause the embryos to enter into diapause. This is known to occur in some [[rodent]]s, [[insectivore]]s and [[marsupial]]s.&lt;ref name="dan"&gt;

===Obligate diapause ===

Obligate diapause is also known as seasonal delayed implantation and is a mechanism that allows mammals to time the birth of their offspring for favorable environmental conditions.  This mechanism occurs as a regular part of the reproductive cycle in mammals such as [[armadillo]]s, all species of [[pinniped]], many [[mustelid]]s, all [[Ursidae|ursids]], one species of [[fruit bat]], and the [[roe deer]].&lt;ref name="dan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

'''Environmental resource management''' is the [[management]] of the interaction and impact of [[Society|human societies]] on the [[natural environment|environment]]. It is not, as the phrase might suggest, the management of the environment itself. Environmental resources management aims to ensure that [[ecosystem services]] are protected and maintained for future human generations, and also maintain ecosystem integrity through considering [[Ethics|ethical]], [[Economy|economic]], and [[Science|scientific]] ([[Ecology|ecological]]) variables.&lt;ref name=Wostl2006&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pahl-Wost, C. |title=The implications of complexity for integrated resource management |journal=Environmental Modelling and Software |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=561–9 |date=May 2007 |doi=10.1016/j.envsoft.2005.12.024 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815206000417}}{{rp|561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental resource management tries to identify factors affected by conflicts that rise between meeting needs and protecting resources.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uehara|first=Thiago Hector Kanashiro|last2=Otero|first2=Gabriela Gomes Prol|last3=Martins|first3=Euder Glendes Andrade|last4=Philippi Jr|first4=Arlindo|last5=Mantovani|first5=Waldir|date=June 2010|title=Pesquisas em gestão ambiental: análise de sua evolução na Universidade de São Paulo|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1414-753X2010000100011&amp;lng=pt&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=pt|journal=Ambiente &amp; Sociedade|volume=13|issue=1|pages=165–185|doi=10.1590/s1414-753x2010000100011|issn=1414-753X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus linked to [[environmental protection]], [[sustainability]] and [[integrated landscape management]].

==Significance==
Environmental resource management is an issue of increasing concern, as reflected in its prevalence in seminal texts influencing global [[Political sociology|sociopolitical]] frameworks such as the [[Brundtland Commission]]'s [[Our Common Future]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=World Commission on Environment and Development |chapter=Our Common Future, Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development |chapterurl=http://www.un-documents.net/wced-ocf.htm |title=Development and International Co-operation: Environment |publisher=United Nations |date=2 August 1987 |id=General Assembly document A/42/427 |url=http://www.un-documents.net/a42-427.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; which highlighted the integrated nature of environment and [[international development]] and the [[Worldwatch Institute]]'s annual [[State of the World (book series)|State of the World]] reports.

The environment determines the nature of people, [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, and places around the [[Earth]], affecting behaviour, [[religion]], [[culture]] and economic practices.

==Scope==
[[File:TerracesBuffers.JPG|thumb|upright|Improved agricultural practices such as these [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraces]] in northwest Iowa can serve to preserve soil and improve water quality]]
Environmental resource management can be viewed from a variety of perspectives. It involves the management of all components of the [[biophysical environment]], both living ([[Biotic component|biotic]]) and non-living ([[Abiotic component|abiotic]]), and the relationships among all living [[species]] and their [[habitat]]s. The environment also involves the relationships of the human environment, such as the social, cultural and economic environment, with the biophysical environment. The essential aspects of environmental resource management are ethical, economical, social, and technological. These underlie principles and help make decisions.

The concept of environmental determinism, probabilism and possibilism are significant in the concept of environmental resource management.

Environmental resource management covers many areas in [[science]], including [[geography]], [[biology]], [[social sciences]], [[political sciences]], [[public policy]], [[ecology]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], and [[physiology]].

==Aspects==

===Ethical===
Environmental resource management strategies are intrinsically driven by conceptions of [[Human-Environment interaction|human-nature relationships]].&lt;ref name=Colby1991&gt;{{cite journal |last=Colby |first=M.E. |title=Environmental management in development: the evolution of paradigms |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=193–213 |date=September 1991 |doi=10.1016/0921-8009(91)90032-A |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/092180099190032A |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethical aspects involve the cultural and social issues relating to the environment, and dealing with changes to it. "All human activities take place in the context of certain types of relationships between society and the bio-physical world (the rest of nature),"&lt;ref name=Colby1991_193&gt;{{harvnb|Colby|1991|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so, there is a great significance in understanding the ethical values of different groups around the world. Broadly speaking, two schools of thought exist in environmental ethics: [[Anthropocentrism]] and [[Ecocentrism]], each influencing a broad spectrum of environmental resource management styles along a continuum.&lt;ref name=Colby1991 /&gt; These styles perceive "...different evidence, imperatives, and problems, and prescribe different solutions, strategies, technologies, roles for economic sectors, culture, governments, and ethics, etc."&lt;ref name=Colby1991_193/&gt;

====Anthropocentrism====
{{Main|Anthropocentrism}}
Anthropocentrism, "...an inclination to evaluate reality exclusively in terms of human values,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anthropocentrism |work=WordNet Search — 3.1 |publisher=Princeton University |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Anthropocentrism&amp;sub=Search+WordNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an ethic reflected in the major interpretations of Western religions and the dominant economic paradigms of the industrialised world.&lt;ref name=Colby1991 /&gt; Anthropocentrism looks at nature as existing solely for the benefit of humans, and as a commodity to use for the good of humanity and to improve human quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=White L |title=The historical roots of our ecologic crisis |journal=Science |volume=155 |issue=3767 |pages=1203–7 |date=March 1967 |pmid=17847526 |doi=10.1126/science.155.3767.1203 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17847526}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Morris |last=Berman |title=The Reenchantment of the World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cUS2tQc7nYcC |year=1981 |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=978-0-8014-9225-9 |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=David |last1=Pepper |first2=John W. |last2=Perkins |first3=Martyn J. |last3=Youngs |title=The Roots of Modern Environmentalism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xMQOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA145 |year=1984 |publisher=Croom Helm |isbn=978-0-7099-2064-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropocentric environmental resource management is therefore not the conservation of the environment solely for the environment's sake, but rather the conservation of the environment, and ecosystem structure, for humans' sake.

====Ecocentrism====
{{Main|Ecocentrism}}

Ecocentrists believe in the intrinsic value of nature while maintaining that human beings must use and even exploit nature to survive and live.&lt;ref name=Purser&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Purser, R. |author2=Montuori, A. |title=Ecocentrism is in the eye of the beholder |journal=Acad. Manage. Rev. |volume=21 |pages=611–3 |date=July 1996 |doi=10.5465/AMR.1996.26115125 |url=http://amr.aom.org/content/21/3/603.full.pdf+html}}{{rp|611}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is this fine ethical line that ecocentrists navigate between fair use and abuse.&lt;ref name=Purser /&gt; At an extreme of the ethical scale, ecocentrism includes philosophies such as [[ecofeminism]] and [[deep ecology]], which evolved as a reaction to dominant anthropocentric paradigms.&lt;ref name=Colby1991 /&gt; "In its current form, it is an attempt to synthesize many old and some new philosophical attitudes about the relationship between nature and human activity, with particular emphasis on ethical, social, and spiritual aspects that have been downplayed in the dominant economic worldview."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colby|1991|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
[[File:Gibraltar East Side Water Catchments in 1992.jpg|thumb|A water harvesting system collects rainwater from the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] into pipes that lead to tanks excavated inside the rock.]]
The economy functions within, and is dependent upon goods and services provided by natural ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Thampa&gt;{{cite book |first=Dodo J. |last=Thampapillai |title=Environmental economics: concepts, methods, and policies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xaCZAAAAIAAJ |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-553577-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the environment is recognized in both [[classical economics]] and [[neoclassical economics]] theories, yet the environment was a lower priority in economic policies from 1950 to 1980 due to emphasis from policy makers on economic growth.&lt;ref name=Thampa /&gt; With the prevalence of environmental problems, many economists embraced the notion that, "If environmental sustainability must coexist for economic sustainability, then the overall system must [permit] identification of an equilibrium between the environment and the economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thampapillai|2002|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, economic policy makers began to incorporate the functions of the natural environment—or [[natural capital]] — particularly as a sink for wastes and for the provision of raw materials and amenities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Allen V. |last1=Kneese |first2=Robert U. |last2=Ayres |first3=Ralph C. |last3=D'Arge |title=Economics and the environment: a materials balance approach |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FCSSAAAAIAAJ |year=1970 |publisher=Resources for the Future; distributed by the Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore |isbn=978-0-8018-1215-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debate continues among economists as to how to account for natural capital, specifically whether resources can be replaced through knowledge and technology, or whether the environment is a closed system that cannot be replenished and is finite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Herman E. |last1=Daly |last2=Cobb |first2=John B. Jr |title=For The Common Good: Redirecting the Economy toward Community, the Environment, and a Sustainable Future |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TZAIU1yqyRkC |year=1994 |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=978-0-8070-4705-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic models influence environmental resource management, in that management policies reflect beliefs about natural capital scarcity. For someone who believes natural capital is infinite and easily substituted, environmental management is irrelevant to the economy.&lt;ref name=Colby1991 /&gt; For example, economic paradigms based on neoclassical models of closed economic systems are primarily concerned with resource scarcity, and thus prescribe legalizing the environment as an economic externality for an environmental resource management strategy.&lt;ref name=Colby1991 /&gt; This approach has often been termed 'Command-and-control'.&lt;ref name=Colby1991 /&gt; Colby has identified trends in the development of economic paradigms, among them, a shift towards more [[ecological economics]] since the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Colby1991 /&gt;

"The pairing of significant uncertainty about the behaviour and response of ecological systems with urgent calls for near-term action constitutes a difficult reality, and a common lament" for many [[Environmental Manager|environmental resource managers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arvai|Gregory|Ohlson|2006|p=2413}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific analysis of the environment deals with several dimensions of ecological uncertainty.&lt;ref name=Arvai2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arvai |first1=J. |last2=Gregory |first2=R. |last3=Ohlson |first3=D. |title=Deconstructing Adaptive Management: Criteria for Applications to Environmental Management |journal=Ecological Applications |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=2411–25 |date=December 2006 |doi=10.1890/1051-0761(2006)016[2411:DAMCFA]2.0.CO;2 |url=http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/1051-0761%282006%29016%5B2411%3ADAMCFA%5D2.0.CO%3B2 |ref=harv |pmid=17205914|hdl=1794/22080 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These include: ''structural uncertainty'' resulting from the misidentification, or lack of information pertaining to the relationships between ecological variables; ''parameter uncertainty'' referring to "uncertainty associated with parameter values that are not known precisely but can be assessed and reported in terms of the likelihood…of experiencing a defined range of outcomes";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arvai|Gregory|Ohlson|2006|p=2417}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''stochastic uncertainty'' stemming from chance or unrelated factors.&lt;ref name=Arvai2006 /&gt; [[Adaptive management]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Carl J. |last=Walters |title=Adaptive management of renewable resources |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMwYAQAAIAAJ |year=1986 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-02-947970-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=C.S. |editor-last=Holling |author=United Nations Environment Programme |title=Adaptive environmental assessment and management |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RRFSAAAAMAAJ |year=1978 |publisher=International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis |isbn=978-0-471-99632-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered a useful framework for dealing with situations of high levels of uncertainty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Lance H. |editor1-last=Gunderson |editor2-first=C.S. |editor2-last=Holling |title=Panarchy Synopsis: Understanding Transformations in Human and Natural Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IRnr9uAWo0EC |year=2002 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=978-1-55963-330-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is not without its detractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walters C, Holling CS |title=Large-scale management experiments and learning by doing |journal=Ecology |volume=71 |issue=6 |pages=2060–8 |date=December 1990 |doi=10.2307/1938620 |url=http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2307/1938620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common scientific concept and impetus behind environmental resource management is [[carrying capacity]]. Simply put, carrying capacity refers to the maximum number of organisms a particular resource can sustain. The concept of carrying capacity, whilst understood by many cultures over history, has its roots in [[Malthusianism|Malthusian]] theory. An example is visible in the EU [[Water Framework Directive]]. However, "it is argued that Western scientific knowledge ... is often insufficient to deal with the full complexity of the interplay of variables in environmental resource management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Johannes RE |title=The case for data-less marine resource management: examples from tropical nearshore finfisheries |journal=Trends Ecol.

===Current paradigm shifts===
To adjust to today's environment of quick social and ecological changes, some organizations have begun to experiment with new tools and concepts.&lt;ref name=Selin&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Selin.

It is important to note that though sustainability of environmental resource management has improved,&lt;ref name=Avery2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dunphy2007 /&gt; corporate sustainability, for one, has yet to reach the majority of global companies operating in the markets.&lt;ref name=GP /&gt; The three major barriers to preventing organizations to shift towards sustainable practice with environmental resource management are not understanding what sustainability is; having difficulty modeling an economically viable case for the switch; and having a flawed execution plan, or a lack thereof.&lt;ref name=BGG /&gt; Therefore, the most important part of shifting an organization to adopt sustainability in environmental resource management would be to create a shared vision and understanding of what sustainability is for that particular organization, and to clarify the business case.&lt;ref name=BGG /&gt;

==Stakeholders==

===Public sector===
[[File:Southern Appalachian bog May 2010.jpg|thumb|A conservation project in [[North Carolina]] involving the search for [[bog turtle]]s was conducted by [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] and the [[North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission]] and its volunteers]]
The [[public sector]] comprises the general government sector plus all public corporations including the [[central bank]].&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2006, Glossary of Statistical Terms: Public Sector. Retrieved 23 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In environmental resource management the public sector is responsible for administering [[natural resource management]] and implementing [[environmental protection]] legislation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DERM&gt;The State of Queensland: Department of Environment and Resource Management (DERM), 2011, What we do. Retrieved 23 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional role of the public sector in environmental resource management is to provide professional judgement through skilled technicians on behalf of the public.&lt;ref name=Selin/&gt; With the increase of intractable environmental problems, the public sector has been led to examine alternative paradigms for managing environmental resources.&lt;ref name=Selin /&gt; This has resulted in the public sector working collaboratively with other sectors (including other governments, private and civil) to encourage sustainable natural resource management behaviours.&lt;ref name=DERM /&gt;

===Private sector===
The [[private sector]] comprises private corporations and non-profit institutions serving households.&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2001, Glossary of Statistical Terms: Private Sector, Retrieved 23 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The private sector's traditional role in environmental resource management is that of the recovery of [[natural resources]].&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith, V.L. |title=Economics of Production from Natural Resources |journal=American Economic Review |volume=58 |issue=3 Part 1 |pages=409–413 |date=June 1968 |jstor=1813767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such private sector recovery groups include mining (minerals and petroleum), forestry and fishery organisations.&lt;ref name=Smith /&gt; Environmental resource management undertaken by the private sectors varies dependent upon the resource type, that being renewable or non-renewable and private and common resources (also see [[Tragedy of the Commons]]).&lt;ref name=Smith /&gt; [[Environmental Manager|Environmental managers]] from the private sector also need skills to manage collaboration within a dynamic social and political environment.&lt;ref name=Selin /&gt;

===Civil society===
[[Civil society]] comprises associations in which societies voluntarily organise themselves into and which represent a wide range of interests and ties.&lt;ref name=oecd07&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2007, Glossary of Statistical Terms: Civil Society Organisations. Retrieved 23 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; These can include community-based organisations, indigenous peoples' organisations and non-government organisations ([[NGO]]).&lt;ref name=oecd07 /&gt; Functioning through strong public pressure, civil society can exercise their legal rights against the implementation of resource management plans, particularly land management plans.&lt;ref name=Selin /&gt; The aim of civil society in environmental resource management is to be included in the decision-making process by means of [[public participation]].&lt;ref name=Selin /&gt; Public participation can be an effective strategy to invoke a sense of social responsibility of natural resources.&lt;ref name=Selin /&gt;

== Tools ==
As with all management functions, effective management tools, standards and systems are required. An environmental management standard or system or [[Protocol (natural sciences)|protocol]] attempts to reduce [[Environmental degradation|environmental impact]] as measured by some objective criteria. The [[ISO 14001]] standard is the most widely used standard for environmental [[risk management]] and is closely aligned to the European [[Eco-Management and Audit Scheme|Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS)]]. As a common auditing standard, the [[ISO 19011]] standard explains how to combine this with [[quality management]].

Other [[environmental management system|environmental management systems (EMS)]] tend to be based on the ISO 14001 standard and many extend it in various ways:
* The Green Dragon Environmental Management Standard is a five-level EMS designed for smaller organisations for whom ISO 14001 may be too onerous and for larger organisations who wish to implement ISO 14001 in a more manageable step-by-step approach,&lt;ref name=greendrag&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wales.groundwork.org.uk/what-we-do/green-dragon-ems.aspx |title=Green Dragon Environmental Standard |publisher=Groundwork UK |accessdate=24 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927061812/http://www.wales.groundwork.org.uk/what-we-do/green-dragon-ems.aspx |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* BS 8555 is a phased standard that can help smaller companies move to ISO 14001 in six manageable steps,
* [[The Natural Step]] focuses on basic [[sustainability]] criteria and helps focus [[engineering]] on reducing use of materials or energy use that is unsustainable in the long term,
* [[Natural Capitalism]] advises using [[accounting reform]] and a general [[biomimicry]] and [[industrial ecology]] approach to do the same thing,
* [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] has many further terms and standards that it defines as appropriate to large-scale EMS,{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}
* The [[UN]] and [[World Bank]] has encouraged adopting a "[[natural capital]]" measurement and management framework,{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}
* The [[European Union]] [[Eco-Management and Audit Scheme|Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS)]].

Other strategies exist that rely on making simple distinctions rather than building top-down management "systems" using [[performance audit]]s and [[full cost accounting]]. For instance, Ecological Intelligent Design divides products into [[consumable]]s, [[service product]]s or durables and [[unsaleable]]s — toxic products that no one should buy, or in many cases, do not realize they are buying. By eliminating the unsaleables from the [[comprehensive outcome]] of any purchase, better environmental resource management is achieved without ''systems''.

Recent successful cases have put forward the notion of ''integrated management''. It shares a wider approach and stresses out the importance of interdisciplinary assessment. It is an interesting notion that might not be adaptable to all cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Billé, R. |title=Integrated Coastal Zone Management: four entrenched illusions |journal=S.A.P.I.EN.S. |volume=1 |issue=2 |year=2008 |url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index198.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Festival of Muslim Cultures''', a national celebration of Muslim cultures held in the United Kingdom, began in January 2006 and ended July 2007. It imitated an earlier event in 1976.  

From official site;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimcultures.org/index2.php?option=home Festival of Muslim Cultures&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation broken|date=September 2008}}
''The festival was created out of the need to encourage a better understanding between Muslims and non-Muslims (as a two-way process), to promote respect for Muslim cultures and to demonstrate how culture creates the pathways that connect us all together.''  Organizers say that festival events were chosen because they represent the best of the Muslim arts world and they "portray diversity and plurality".

==Festival's organisation==
[[Prince Charles]] was a patron &amp; the festival director is [[Isabel Carlisle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimcultures.org/index2.php?option=whoiswho Festival of Muslim Cultures&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation broken|date=September 2008}} Shiban Akbar of the [[Muslim Council of Britain|MCB]] was on the Advisory Board.&lt;ref name="10000115FestivalofMuslimCultures2005.pdf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlanorthwest.org.uk/assets/documents/10000115FestivalofMuslimCultures2005.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009081957/http://www.mlanorthwest.org.uk/assets/documents/10000115FestivalofMuslimCultures2005.pdf |archivedate=9 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trustees===
* Raficq Abdulla [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (Lawyer, interpreter of Rumi and Attar, broadcaster and writer)
* Mahmood Ahmed ([[Corporate Lawyer]] and former President of the [[Ismaili]] Council for the UK)
* Majid Dawood (CEO of Yasaar, [[Shariah]] compliance services company)
* Sayyed Nadeem Kazmi (Head of [[International Development]], Al-Khoei Foundation, London)
* Shahwar Sadeque (Former BBC Governor and former Commissioner of the [[Commission for Racial Equality]])
As a founder trustee, the late [[Zaki Badawi|Dr Zaki Badawi]] played a key role from the beginning in shaping the Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,60-2008577_2,00.html | work=The Times | location=London | accessdate=2010-05-02 | first=Anushka | last=Asthana}} {{Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The festival, a [[registered charity]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?regno=1106292&amp;submit=Run+Search charity number 1106292]&lt;/ref&gt; receives government funding from; [[Arts Council England]], City of London, [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)]], [[Home Office]] and [[British Council]].&lt;ref&gt; Other sponsors were listed at http://www.muslimcultures.org/index2.php?option=sponsors&lt;/ref&gt; It has a provisional budget of £6,000,000 which is around $10,500,000 USD.&lt;ref name="10000115FestivalofMuslimCultures2005.pdf"/&gt;

==Controversy==
In August 2005, [[The Observer]] reported that the [[Muslim Council of Britain|Muslim Council of Britain (MCB)]] used its influence in [[Whitehall]] to gain a place on the festival's board of trustees. Festival organisers were instructed to comply with Islamic [[sharia law]] to gain the [[Muslim Council of Britain|MCB's]] full support. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The organisers are now concerned that the festival will lose political backing if they invite performers who are seen to be 'un-Islamic'. Festival organisers already hope to invite the Uzbek singer, Sevara Nezarkhan, who does not wear the headscarf or '[[hijab]]' and has worked with [[Jewish]] '[[klezmer]]' musicians. It also intends to exhibit the 14th-century world history of [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid al-Din]], which represents the human form and the prophet [[Mohammed]] himself, thought by some strict Muslims to be forbidden. Other performers could include the [[Senegalese]] musician [[Youssou N'dour]] and the [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshi]]-British dancer Akram Khan. The Observer understands that the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] insisted that the festival organisers involved the [[Muslim Council of Britain|MCB]] before they would give them their full backing. As a result, an [[Muslim Council of Britain|MCB]] nominee has been taken on to the festival's board of trustees. One source close to the festival organisers said, "We constantly found our efforts were being blocked and it kept coming back to the MCB and its sympathisers within Whitehall."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1548786,00.html| title=Radical links of UK's 'moderate' Muslim group| date=14 August 2005| publisher=The Observer| accessdate=2006-09-21 | location=London | first=Martin | last=Bright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Muslim Council of Britain|MCB]] responded with, "The MCB believes that the Festival will need to be broad-based, inclusive and mindful of the teachings of Islam if it is to have the support of British Muslims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mcb.org.uk/media/presstext.php?ann_id=159| date=14 August 2005| title=MCB Responds to The Observer's 'Investigation'| publisher=The Muslim Council of Britain| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209071852/http://www.mcb.org.uk/media/presstext.php?ann_id=159| archivedate=9 February 2006| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just days after the controversy surrounding [[Muslim Council of Britain|MCB]] Secretary General [[Iqbal Sacranie]]'s [[Muslim Council of Britain#Support and criticism|comments on homosexuality]], the conservative British Muslim establishment became embroiled in another [[homophobia]] scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_060123sacranie.shtml Sacranie charge dropped, but Muslim gay row continues – news from ekklesia | Ekklesia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 January 2006 Sandra Laville reported in [[The Guardian]], 'Promotional publicity states that the festival will feature the 'diversity and plurality' of Muslim cultures, but gay Muslims say they have been refused permission to present an event.’
[[Aaron Saeed]], Muslim affairs spokesman for the gay rights group [[OutRage!]], wrote to festival director [[Isabel Carlisle]], offering to stage an event celebrating the lives and experiences of gay Muslims in Britain and abroad but his offer was refused.&lt;ref name="0,2763,1692804,00.html"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/religion/Story/0,2763,1692804,00.html?gusrc=rss| title=Festival of Muslim cultures refuses to allow gay event| first=Sandra | last=Laville| date=23 January 2006| publisher=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Isabel Carlisle]]'s reply, she justifies the exclusion of gay Muslims on the grounds 'we are not prepared to present works that will give offence to significant numbers.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petertatchell.net/religion/muslimcultures.htm Blasphemy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, when interviewed for [[The Guardian]] she claimed that gay Muslim participation was rejected because the festival does not want to feature 'political' themes.&lt;ref name="0,2763,1692804,00.html"/&gt;

“This is not what her rejection letter states," said [[Aaron Saeed]]. "It says we have been turned down because gay Muslims would give offence. Our proposal was not political. It was for a series of cultural events about the lives and experiences of lesbian and gay Muslims. We planned to organise these events in conjunction with gay Muslim individuals and organisations beyond [[OutRage!]]. These were never envisaged as [[OutRage!]] events. We made that clear. This ban is straightforward homophobia. It is deeply offensive to suggest that gay Muslim people are not a valid part of the Muslim community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outrage.org.uk/pressrelease.asp?ID=333 |title=OutRage! press release – Muslim Festival bans gay Muslims |accessdate=2006-09-21 |df=dmy }}{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} (404 error as of last access date)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Saeed concludes, "It is appalling that a registered charity is allowed to discriminate against gay people ... It is time the conservative leadership of the Muslim community got used to the fact that gay Muslims are here to stay and here to fight."
Muhammad Yusuf, a member of the [[Inter-religious Organisations|Interfaith Alliance]], said it was a "matter of regret" that a festival aiming to reflect the diversity of Muslim culture was not prepared to take on board a facet that was different by reason of sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="0,2763,1692804,00.html"/&gt;

A '''food group''' is a collection of [[food]]s that share similar [[nutrition]]al properties or [[biological classification]]s. [[List of nutrition guides|Nutrition guides]] typically divide foods into food groups and [[Recommended Dietary Allowance|recommend]] daily [[serving size|servings]] of each group for a [[health]]y [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]. In the United States for instance, [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] has described food as being in from 4 to 11 different groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nestle, Marion|authorlink=Marion Nestle|title=Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health|year=2013|origyear=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-27596-6|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The most common food groups==
* '''[[Dairy product|Dairy]]''', also called '''milk products''' and sometimes categorized with [[:Category:Milk substitutes|milk alternatives]] or meat, is typically a smaller category in [[nutrition guides]],&lt;ref name=AU&gt;{{cite web|title=The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating - Enjoy a Variety of Foods Every Day |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/health-pubhlth-strateg-food-guide-guide2.htm |work=Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing |accessdate=3 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319033600/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-pubhlth-strateg-food-guide-guide2.htm |archivedate=March 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UK&gt;{{cite web|title=The eatwell plate|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/eatwell-plate.aspx|work=National Health Service|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=US&gt;{{cite web|title=USDA's MyPlate|url=http://www.choosemyplate.gov/|work=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; if present at all, and is sometimes listed apart from other food groups.&lt;ref name="AU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UK" /&gt; Examples of dairy products include milk, butter, ghee, [[yogurt]], [[cheese]], cream and ice cream. The categorization of dairy as a food group with recommended daily servings has been criticized by, for example, the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] who point out that "research has shown little benefit, and considerable potential for harm, of such high dairy intakes. Moderate consumption of milk or other dairy products—one to two servings a day—is fine, and likely has some benefits for children. But it’s not essential for adults, for a host of reasons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-eating-plate-questions/|title=Healthy Eating Plate &amp; Healthy Eating Pyramid|date=18 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Fruits]]''', sometimes categorized with vegetables, include [[apple]]s, [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[banana]]s, [[berry|berries]] and [[lemon]]s. Fruits contain carbohydrates, mostly in the form of sugar as well as important vitamins and minerals.
* '''[[Cereal|Grains, beans and legumes]]''', sometimes categorized as '''cereals''', is often the largest category in nutrition guides.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;&lt;ref name=UK/&gt;&lt;ref name=US/&gt; Examples include [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[oat]]s, [[barley]], [[bread]] and [[pasta]]. An example of beans would be baked beans and soy beans, while an example of legumes would be lentils and chickpeas. Grains are a good source of [[starch]] and are often categorized with other starchy food such as potatoes. 
* '''[[Meat]]''', sometimes labelled '''[[protein]]''' and occasionally inclusive of [[legume]]s and beans, [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[meat analogue]]s and/or dairy, is typically a medium- to smaller-sized category in nutrition guides.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;&lt;ref name=UK/&gt;&lt;ref name=US/&gt; Examples include [[chicken (food)|chicken]], [[fish (food)|fish]], [[turkey (food)|turkey]], [[pork]] and [[beef]].
* '''[[confectionery|Confections]]''', also called '''[[confectionery|sugary foods]]''' and sometimes categorized with [[fat]]s and [[oils]], is typically a very small category in nutrition guides, if present at all, and is sometimes listed apart from other food groups.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;&lt;ref name=UK/&gt; Examples include [[candy]], [[soft drinks]], and chocolate. 
* '''[[Vegetable]]s''', sometimes categorized with fruit and occasionally inclusive of [[legumes]], is typically a large category second only to [[Food grain|grain]]s, or sometimes equal or superior to grains, in nutrition guides.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;&lt;ref name=UK/&gt;&lt;ref name=US/&gt; Examples include [[spinach]], [[carrot]]s, [[onion]]s, and [[broccoli]].
* '''[[Drinking water|Water]]''' is treated in very different ways by different food guides. Some exclude the category,&lt;ref name=US/&gt; others list it separately from other food groups,&lt;ref name=AU/&gt; and yet others make it the center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eine runde Sache: Der neue DGE-Ernährungskreis|url=http://www.dge.de/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=219|work=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ernährung|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; or foundation&lt;ref name=UM&gt;{{cite web|title=Healing Foods Pyramid™ 2010|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/umim/food-pyramid/|work=University of Michigan Health System|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the guide. Water is sometimes categorized with [[tea]], [[fruit juice]], [[vegetable juice]] and even [[soup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recommendations for healthy, tasty eating and drinking for adults|url=http://www.sge-ssn.ch/fileadmin/pdf/100-ernaehrungsthemen/10-gesundes_essen_trinken/Food_Pyramid.pdf|work=Swiss Society for Nutrition|accessdate=12 June 2011|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is typically recommended in plentiful amounts.

==Uncommon food groups==
The number of "common" food groups varies depending on who is defining them. [[Canada's Food Guide]], which has been in continual publication since 1942 and is the second most requested government document (after the income tax form) in [[Canada]], recognizes only four official food groups, listing the remainder of foods as "another". Some of these "others" include:
* '''[[Alcoholic beverage|Alcohol]]''' is listed apart from other food groups and recommended only for certain people in moderation by [[Harvard School of Public Health|Harvard]]'s Healthy Eating Pyramid and the [[University of Michigan]]'s Healing Foods Pyramid,&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthy Eating Pyramid|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-eating-plate/|work=Harvard School of Public Health|accessdate=23 August 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UM"/&gt; while [[Italy]]'s food pyramid includes a half-serving of wine and beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Piramide Alimentare Italiana|url=http://www.piramidealimentare.it/|work=Istituto di Scienza dell'Alimentazione|publisher=Università di Roma|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''German Archaeological Institute''' ({{lang-de|Deutsches Archäologisches Institut}}, ''DAI'') is an institution of research within the field of [[archaeology]] (and related fields),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dainst.org/en/objectives?ft=all Deutsches Archäologisches Institut] retrieved 12:33GMT&lt;/ref&gt; and  a "scientific corporation", under the auspices of the [[Federal Foreign Office|federal Foreign Office of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dainst.org Deutsches Archäologisches Institut] retrieved 12:26GMT 2.10.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/Startseite_node.html Federal Foreign Office] retrieved 12:47GMT 2.10.11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

[[Eduard Gerhard]] was the founder of the institute, according to the homepage of DAI. On the occasion of his leaving [[Rome]],  the headquarters of the then ''Instituto di corrispondenza archeologica'', established within Berlin in 1832,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dainst.org/en/history?ft=all Deutsches Archäologisches Institut] retrieved 12:38GMT 2.10.11&lt;/ref&gt; from the institute previously founded by [[Otto Magnus von Stackelberg (archaeologist)|Otto Magnus von Stackelberg]], [[Theodor Panofka]] and [[August Kestner]] in 1829 in Rome.

There are offices in many other cities, currently including [[Madrid]], Rome, [[Istanbul]], [[Athens]], [[Cairo]], [[Damascus]], [[Baghdad]], [[Tehran]] and [[Sana'a]]. Its Romano-Germanic Commission (Römisch-Germanische Kommission), including the world's largest library for prehistoric archaeology, is located in [[Frankfurt]], its Commission for the History of [[Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]] in [[Munich]] and its Commission for the Archaeology of Non-European Cultures in [[Bonn]]. 

[[Hans-Joachim Gehrke]] was President of the Institute from March 2008 to April 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hans-joachim-gehrke.de/?page_id=2  Timeline of Hans-Joachim Gehrke] retrieved 16:08GMT 2.10.11&lt;/ref&gt;  succeeded by [[Friederike Fless]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/klassarch/mitarbeiter/professoren/fless.html Institut für Klassische Archäologie] retrieved 16:26GMT 2.10.11&lt;/ref&gt;

An important retired employee is [[Jutta Meischner]]. She retired after 35 years of service in the German Archeological Institute in 2000. During this time she continued her studies of late antique portraiture, which culminated in a brief monograph entitled "Portraits of Late Antiquity".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3066">'''ISC3 (Industrial Source Complex)''' model is a popular steady-state [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Gaussian plume model]] which can be used to assess pollutant concentrations from a wide variety of sources associated with an industrial complex.

This model can account for the following: 
* [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Point, area, line, and volume sources]]
* [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Settling and dry deposition of particles]] 
* [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Downwash]] 
* Separation of point sources
* Limited terrain adjustment

ISC3 operates in both [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|long-term and short-term]] modes. The screening version of ISC3 is [[List of atmospheric dispersion models#Screening models|SCREEN3]].

Very recently, the status of ISC3 as a [[List of atmospheric dispersion models#Preferred and recommended models|Preferred/Recommended Model]] of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] has been withdrawn, but it can still be used as an alternative to the Preferred/Recommended models in regulatory applications with case-by-case justification to the reviewing authority.

== Input data ==

ISC short term version required two sets of data: source data and hourly averaged [[meteorological]] data:

=== Source data ===

* Dimensions of the source
* [[Air pollution|Emission]] discharge rate
* Release height of the emission source

=== Meteorological data ===

* Ambient temperature, K
* Wind direction
* Wind speed, m/s
* Atmospheric [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|stability classes]] (A through F, entered as  1 through 6)
* [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Urban and rural]] mixing height, m

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6095">'''Imposex''' is a disorder in [[sea snail]]s caused by the [[toxic]] effects of certain marine [[pollutant]]s. These pollutants cause female [[sea snail]]s ([[marine (ocean)|marine]] [[gastropod]] [[mollusc]]s) to develop male [[sex organs]] such as a [[penis]] and a [[vas deferens]].

==Imposex inducing substances==
[[File:Tributyltin hydride.png|thumb|Tributyltin (TBT) hydride model]]

It was believed that the only inducer of imposex was [[tributyltin]] (TBT),&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz JM, Quintela M, Barreiro R (1998) [http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/170/m170p293.pdf Tributyltin and imposex: no uncertainty shown.] ''Mar Ecol Prog Ser'' '''170''': 293–294
&lt;/ref&gt; which can be active in extremely low concentrations, but recent studies reported other substances as inducers, such as [[triphenyltin]]&lt;ref name="Hori"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0025-326X(95)00133-8|last=Horiguchi|first=T.|year=1995|title=Imposex in Japanese gastropods (Neogastropoda and Mesogastropoda): effects of tributyltin and triphenyltin from anti-fouling paints|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|publisher=Oxford|volume=31|pages=402–405|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V6N-404RMY0-18&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1026249491&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=637bfa79b5ab2d19394e2b32d38a4ef7|issue=4–12|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ethanol]].&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3354/meps158191|last=Davies|first=I.

==Abnormalities==
In the [[dog whelk]], the growth of a penis in imposex females gradually blocks the [[oviduct]], although [[ovule]] production continues. An imposex female dog whelk passes through several stages of penis growth before it becomes unable to maintain a constant production of ovules. Later stages of imposex lead to [[Infertility|sterility]] and the premature death of the females of reproductive age, which can adversely affect the entire [[population]].&lt;ref name="Castro"/&gt;

==Biomonitoring==

The imposex stages of female dog whelks and other molluscs (including ''[[Nucella lima]]'') are used in the United Kingdom and worldwide to [[biomonitoring|monitor]] levels of tributyltin. The RPSI (Relative Penis Size Index) of females to males, and the VDSI (Vas Deferens Sequence Index) are used to monitor levels of tributyltin in [[marine environment]]s.

On September 29, 2007, the [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], newspaper ''The Chronicle Herald'' featured a story on female dog whelks on the shores of Halifax Harbour and other parts of Nova Scotia, where they live on the beach in the [[intertidal zone]]. The report stated that female dog whelks still grow penises even after a ban on tributyltin.&lt;ref&gt;"Tiny Snail, Big Problem" The Chronicle Herald, Halifax, NS, Canada.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4840">A '''Malthusian growth model''', sometimes called a '''simple exponential''' growth model, is essentially [[exponential growth]] based on the idea of the function being proportional to the speed to which the function grows. The model is named after [[ Thomas Robert Malthus]], who wrote ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' (1798), one of the earliest and most influential books on [[population]].&lt;ref name=malthus&gt;"Malthus, An Essay on the Principle of Population: Library of Economics"&lt;/ref&gt;

Malthusian models have the following form:
:&lt;math&gt; P(t) = P_0e^{rt} &lt;/math&gt;
where

* ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''(0) is the initial population size,
* ''r'' = the population growth rate, sometimes called ''Malthusian parameter'',
* ''t'' = time.

The model can also been written in the form of a differential equation:

dP/dt = rP

with initial condition:
P(0)= P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;

This model is often referred to as the ''exponential law''.&lt;ref&gt;Turchin, P. "Complex population dynamics: a theoretical/empirical synthesis" Princeton [http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7436.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely regarded in the field of [[population ecology]] as the [[first principle]] of [[population dynamics]],&lt;ref&gt;Turchin, P. "Does Population Ecology Have General Laws?" Oikos 94:17–26. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Malthus]] as the founder. The exponential law is therefore also sometimes referred to as the ''Malthusian Law''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Haemig, "Laws of Population Ecology", 2005&lt;/ref&gt; By now, it is a widely accepted view to analogize Malthusian growth in Ecology to [[Newton's First Law|Newton's First Law of uniform motion]] in physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ginzburg|first=Lev R.|title=The theory of population dynamics: I. Back to first principles|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0022-5193(86)80180-1|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|language=en|volume=122|issue=4|pages=385–399|doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(86)80180-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malthus wrote that all life forms, including humans, have a propensity to exponential population growth when resources are abundant but that actual growth is limited by available resources:
{{quote|Through the animal and vegetable kingdoms, nature has scattered the seeds of life abroad with the most profuse and liberal hand.... The germs of existence contained in this spot of earth, with ample food, and ample room to expand in, would fill millions of worlds in the course of a few thousand years. Necessity, that imperious all pervading law of nature, restrains them within the prescribed bounds. The race of plants, and the race of animals shrink under this great restrictive law. And the race of man cannot, by any efforts of reason, escape from it. Among plants and animals its effects are waste of seed, sickness, and premature death. Among mankind, misery and vice. |Thomas Malthus, 1798. ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]''. Chapter I.}}

A model of population growth bounded by resource limitations was developed by [[Pierre Francois Verhulst]] in 1838, after he had read Malthus' essay. Verhulst named the model a [[logistic function]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1790">A '''myc tag''' is a polypeptide [[protein tag]] derived from the [[c-myc]] gene product that can be added to a protein using [[recombinant DNA]] technology. It can be used for [[affinity chromatography]], then used to separate recombinant, overexpressed protein from wild type protein expressed by the host organism. It can also be used in the isolation of protein complexes with multiple subunits.

A myc tag can be used in many different assays that require recognition by an [[antibody]]. If there is no antibody against the studied protein, adding a myc-tag allows one to follow the protein with an antibody against the Myc epitope. Examples are cellular localization studies by immunofluorescence or detection by [[Western blotting]].

The peptide sequence of the myc-tag is (in 1- and 3-letter codes, respectively): N-EQKLISEEDL-C, N-Glu-Gln-Lys-Leu-Ile-Ser-Glu-Glu-Asp-Leu-C, where N stands for [[Amino-terminus]] and C stands for [[Carboxy terminus]]. The tag is approximately 1202 [[Dalton (unit)|Daltons]] in atomic mass and has 10 amino acids.

It can be fused to the [[C-terminus]] and the [[N-terminus]] of a protein. It is advisable not to fuse the tag directly behind the signal peptide of a secretory protein, since it can interfere with translocation into the [[secretory pathway]].

A monoclonal antibody against the myc [[epitope]], named 9E10, is available from the non-commercial [[Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dshb.biology.uiowa.edu/c-myc Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank 9E10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922211658/http://dshb.biology.uiowa.edu/c-myc |date=2009-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a Chinese Ministry of Education [[Double First Class University Plan|Double First Class Discipline University]], with Double First Class status in certain disciplines.&lt;ref name="Chinese Department of Education"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A22/moe_843/201709/t20170921_314942.html |title=教育部 财政部 国家发展改革委 关于公布世界一流大学和一流学科建设高校及建设 学科名单的通知 (Notice from the Ministry of Education and other national governmental departments announcing the list of double first class universities and disciplines)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Gate of NEFU.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The main entrance of NEFU, the school gate since established]]
Founded in 1952, Northeast Forestry University (NEFU) was formed by the combination of both [[Zhejiang University]] and Forestry Department of [[Northeast Agricultural University|Northeast Agricultural College]], and one of the three oldest institutions for forestry education and research all over the country.

==Location==
Northeast Forestry University is located in the city of [[Harbin]], the center of the region with China's largest state-owned forests. Its campus covers more than 136 [[hectares]] with teaching buildings, scientific research laboratories and practice sites. In addition, there are several practice centers which include the Maoershan Experimental Forestry Center (Maoershan National Forest Park) and the Liangshui Experimental Forestry Center (Liangshui National Nature Reserve) etc. Therefore,the university has a total area of 33,000 hectares.

The campus covers 136 hectares, there are 15 dormitories, and only one dining hall. As a university which has more than 20,000 undergraduate students enrolled, the population density is larger than other universities in China.

[[Image:Penetration sizing.jpg|thumb|right|Common guidelines for the proper sizing of [[firestop]]s, to provide accurate pricing and accountability for field variances.]]
'''Penetrants''', or '''penetrating items''', are the mechanical, electrical or structural items that pass through an opening in a wall or floor, such as [[plumbing|pipes]], [[conduit (electrical)|electrical conduits]], [[Duct (HVAC)|ducting]], [[electrical cable]]s and [[cable tray]]s, or [[structural steel]] beams and columns.  When these items pierce a wall or floor assembly, they create a space between the penetrant and the  surrounding structure, which can become an avenue for the spread of fire between rooms or floors.   Modern [[building code]]s generally require a service [[Penetration (firestop)|penetration]] [[firestop]] to seal the openings around penetrants (or "services"), in order to restore the [[fire-resistance rating]] of the parent assembly.  

Sizing of all openings has significant impact upon the adherence to the [[certification listing]] requirements. Therefore, communication between all affected trades is of great importance ''before'' any openings are made, to ensure proper sizing of the openings for [[cost]] control and conformance with [[listing and approval use and compliance]].

Penetrants are typically accommodated by plumbers and electricians, who prepare for them by installing sleeves in [[concrete]] walls and floors, before they are poured.  In the case of [[masonry]] walls, electricians and plumbers tend to be there first and hang sleeves around their piping, ductwork and conduit, where they know from their drawings that block walls will be erected, in order to avoid the time and expense of having to ''cut'' openings in existing walls and floors.

In the case of [[drywall]] assemblies, the opening size is determined by the drywall contractor, unless the mechanical and electrical trades are [[contract]]ually [[obligation|obliged]] to provide sleeving here as well, with proper [[fastener|fastening]] methods that are in conformance with the certification listing. It is not uncommon for these trades to attempt to absolve themselves of the requirement to firestop their openings in the drywall assemblies by claiming that they were there first, meaning that others should take care of the rest. Since drywall [[Subcontractor|contractor]]s are not ordinarily required to do mechanical and electrical firestopping, the drywall openings can become an item of dispute or [[negligence|neglect]], particularly in [[North America]]n [[construction]]. This common issue can be minimised by designating a separate firestopping sub-contract, whereby a separate speciality sub-contractor firestops ''all'' openings on site, mechanical, electrical and structural, as well as the [[Joint (building)|building joints]]. 

Timber floor openings are simply cut by means of a [[chainsaw]]. In this case, the width of the blade will determine sizes.

The '''Petroleum University of Technology''' ({{lang-fa|دانشگاه صنعت نفت}}) is a leading Iranian [[Public university|public]] university funded by the [[Ministry of Petroleum (Iran)|Ministry of Petroleum]] particularly by its main company, the [[National Iranian Oil Company|NIOC]] . It was  founded in 1939 in [[Abadan]] in response to the increasing industrialization of Iran oil company, and is officially the second oldest university in Iran after [[University of Tehran]]&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt; and based on The Center for World University Rankings (CWUR), this university has the 7th worldwide rank in oil an gas sector and petroleum engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{https://cwur.org/2017/subjects.php#Engineering, Petroleum}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source|sure=n|reason=Reference is not a reliable website and there is no prove for the claim there.|date=September 2017}} It offers [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]], [[Master of Science|M.S]] and [[Doctorate]] programs for upstream and downstream oil and gas industry such as [[petroleum engineering]], [[chemical engineering]],  [[offshore  engineering]],  [[instrumentation engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[accounting]], and [[marine engineering]].

It has four campuses in [[Ahwaz]], [[Abadan]], [[Tehran]] and [[Mahmudabad, Mazandaran|Mahmudabad]] and some research centers.

== History ==
[[File:نمای ورود دانشکده.jpg|thumb|Ahwaz Petroleum University of Technology]]

[[File:Abadan Petroleum University.jpg|thumb|Abadan Institute of Technology in 1939]]
The name of the university has been changed several times. The university was established in 1939 in [[Abadan]] as '''Abadan Technical School'''. The academic program comprised working and studying in sequence. The students (if employed) spent two-fifth of the academic program in the school and three-fifth in the '''Abadan Refinery''' ({{lang-fa|پالايشگاه آبادان}} ''Pālāyeshgāh-e Ābādān'') as trainees.&lt;ref name="put history"/&gt;

In 1956, the name was changed to '''Abadan Technical College'''. By then, the educational program focused on the general engineering major; admissions were given to 4th grade high school students after passing an entry test and interviews. The last admissions of the program were granted in 1961 and the last students graduated in 1961.&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

In 1962, the name changed to  '''Abadan Institute of Technology''' (AIT). The programs offered [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degrees in petroleum engineering, economic and administrative sciences and accounting. The programs was still internship-orientated.&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

After the outbreak of the [[Iran–Iraq War|War]], the university was relocated. It was first moved to [[Gachsaran County|Gachsaran]] in 1981. The universities all over the country reopened in December 1982 and the university moved to the current location of Ahwaz Faculty of Petroleum in [[Kut-e Abdollah]], [[Karun, Khuzestan|Karun County]].&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

After the [[Iran–Iraq War|War]], in 1989, the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education granted permission to found the Petroleum University of Technology. All the educational institutions of the [[Ministry of Petroleum (Iran)|Ministry of Petroleum]] are supervised by the university. [[Ministry of Petroleum (Iran)|Ministry of Petroleum]], then founded the '''Abadan Shahid Tondghuyan Faculty of Chemical and Petrochemical Engineering''' or Abadan Faculty of Petroleum in {{date|February 1992}} in the location of the former Abadan Institute of Technology and The Research Center of Petroleum University of Technology in the campus of the current Ahwaz Faculty of Petroleum in 1993.&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

== Today==
As of 2015, the Petroleum University of Technology consists of four faculties in cities that offer 13 [[undergraduate]], 11 [[graduate school|graduate]] and three [[doctorate]] programs:
* Ahwaz Faculty of Petroleum (or PUT Ahwaz), 
* Abadan Faculty of Petroleum (or PUT Abadan),
* Tehran Faculty of Petroleum ([[N.I.O.C. school of Accounting and Finance ]]) (or PUT Tehran),
* [[Mahmudabad, Mazandaran|Mahmudabad]] Faculty of Marine Sciences (or PUT Mahmudabad).&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

The university has four research centers:
* Ahwaz Faculty of Petroleum Research Center;
* Abadan Faculty of Petroleum Research Center;
* Tehran Faculty of Petroleum Research Center and,
* Mahmudabad Faculty of Marine Sciences Offshore Oil &amp; Gas Industries Research Center.&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

==Roles and goals==
The priorities of the PUT are maintaining the resources of oil and gas in the country and training manpower for the development and exploitation of these resources.

== Students ==
According to the results of M.S. [[Iranian University Entrance Exam|Entrance Examinations]], PUT students are the best among other universities like [[Sharif University of Technology]] and [[Amirkabir University of Technology]] in Petroleum and Chemical Engineering, and Accounting . The university has sent some of its students to the  [[University of Calgary]], [[Curtin University of Technology]] and [[French Institute of Petroleum]] (IFP).

A student has won the bronze medal of the 9th South Eastern European Mathematical Olympiad for University Students (SEEMOUS 2015) that took place in [[Ohrid]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], from March 3–8, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=افتخارآفرینی دانشجوی دانشگاه صنعت نفت در المپیاد جهانی ریاضی|url=http://www.shana.ir/fa/newsagency/236898/%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A2%D9%81%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%AC%D9%88%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87-%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%AA-%D9%86%D9%81%D8%AA-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%BE%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AC%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B6%DB%8C|accessdate=13 September 2015|work=شبکه اطلاع‌رسایی نفت و انرژی|agency=شانا|date=March 10, 2015|language=Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phosphatidylserine''' (abbreviated '''Ptd-L-Ser''' or '''PS''') is a [[phospholipid]] and is a [[Membrane lipids|component of the cell membrane]]. It plays a key role in cell cycle signaling, specifically in relation to [[apoptosis]]. It is a key pathway for viruses to enter cells via '''[[Molecular mimicry|viral apoptotic mimicry]]'''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

== Structure ==
Phosphatidylserine is a [[phospholipid]] (more specifically a [[glycerophospholipid]]). It consists of two fatty acids attached in ester linkage to the first and second carbon of glycerol and [[serine]] attached through a phosphodiester linkage to the third carbon of the glycerol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lehninger Principles of biochemistry|last=Nelson|first=David|last2=Cox|first2=Michael|publisher=W.H Freeman and company|year=|isbn=9781429208925|edition=5|location=|pages=350|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phosphatidylserine coming from plants and phosphatidylserine coming from animals differ in fatty acid composition.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products|first=Nutrition and Allergies|date=2010-10-01|title=Scientific Opinion on the substantiation of health claims related to phosphatidyl serine (ID 552, 711, 734, 1632, 1927) pursuant to Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1749/abstract|journal=EFSA Journal|volume=8|issue=10|pages=1749|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1749|issn=1831-4732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological function ==

===Cell signaling===
Phosphatidylserine(s) are actively held facing the [[cytosolic]] (inner) side of the cell membrane by the enzyme [[flippase]]. However, when a cell undergoes [[apoptosis]], phosphatidylserine is no longer restricted to the cytosolic side by [[flippase]]. Instead [[scramblase]] catalyzes the rapid exchange of phosphatidylserine between the two sides. When the phosphatidylserines flip to the extracellular (outer) surface of the cell, they act as a signal for macrophages to engulf the cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verhoven|first1=B.|last2=Schlegel|first2=R.

===Coagulation===
Phosphatidylserine plays a role in blood [[coagulation]] (also known as clotting). When circulating [[platelet]]s encounter the site of an injury, [[collagen]] and [[thrombin]] -mediated activation causes externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) from the inner membrane layer, where it serves as a pro-coagulant surface.&lt;ref name="coag"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Exposure of platelet membrane phosphatidylserine regulates blood coagulation |journal=Prog Lipid Res. |date=September 2003 |last=Lentz |first=B. R. |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=423–438 |pmid=12814644 |doi=10.1016/s0163-7827(03)00025-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This surface acts to orient coagulation proteases, specifically [[tissue factor]] (TF) and [[factor VII]], facilitating further [[proteolysis]], activation of [[factor X]], and ultimately generating thrombin.&lt;ref name="coag"/&gt;

In the coagulation disorder [[Scott syndrome]], the mechanism in platelets for transportation of PS from the inner platelet membrane surface to the outer membrane surface is defective.&lt;ref&gt;Zwaal FA, Comfurius P, Bevers EM. ''Scott syndrome, a bleeding disorder caused by defective scrambling of membrane phospholipids''. Biochem Bioph Acta 2004; 1636:119-128&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized as a mild bleeding disorder stemming from the patient's deficiency in thrombin synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss HJ. ''Scott syndrome: a disorder of platelet coagulant activity (PCA).'' Sem Hemat 1994; 31:312-319&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biosynthesis==
[[Image:Biosynthesis of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine.svg|thumb|Biosynthesis of phosphatidylserine]]
Phosphatidylserine is biosynthesized in bacteria by condensing the amino acid [[serine]] with CDP ([[cytidine diphosphate]])-activated [[phosphatidic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christie|first1=William W.|title=Phosphatidylserine and Related Lipids: Structure, Occurrence, Biochemistry and Analysis|url=http://aocs.files.cms-plus.com/LipidsLibrary/images/Importedfiles/lipidlibrary/Lipids/ps/file.pdf|website=The American Oil Chemists’ Society Lipid Library|accessdate=20 April 2017|date=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mammals, phosphatidylserine is produced by base-exchange reactions with [[phosphatidylcholine]] and [[phosphatidylethanolamine]]. Conversely, phosphatidylserine can also give rise to [[phosphatidylethanolamine]] and [[phosphatidylcholine]], although in animals the pathway to generate phosphatidylcholine from phosphatidylserine only operates in the liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christie|first1=William W.|title=Phosphatidylcholine and Related Lipids: Structure, Occurrence, Biochemistry and Analysis|url=http://aocs.files.cms-plus.com/LipidsLibrary/images/Importedfiles/lipidlibrary/Lipids/pc/file.pdf|website=The American Oil Chemists’ Society Lipid Library|accessdate=20 April 2017|date=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary sources==
The average daily phosphatidylserine (PS) intake from diet in [[Western countries]] is estimated to be 130&amp;nbsp;mg.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} PS may be found in meat and fish. Only small amounts of PS can be found in dairy products or in vegetables, with the exception of white beans and soy lecithin.

'''Table 1.''' PS content in different foods.&lt;ref name="Souci_2008"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Souci SW, Fachmann E, Kraut H | year=2008 | title=Food Composition and Nutrition Tables. Medpharm Scientific Publishers Stuttgart}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soy products are not in this table, because commercial PS is made by enzymatically converting soy phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) to phosphatidylserine, rather than purifying phosphatidylserine from soy.

==Supplementation==

=== Health claims ===
A panel of the [[European Food Safety Authority]] concluded that a cause and effect relationship cannot be established between the consumption of phosphatidylserine and "memory and cognitive functioning in the elderly”, “mental health/cognitive function” and “stress reduction and enhanced memory function”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The reason is that bovine brain cortex- and soy-based phosphatidylserine are different substances and might, therefore, have different biological activities. Therefore, the results of studies using PS coming from different sources cannot be generalized.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Cognition ====
In May, 2003 the [[Food and Drug Administration]] gave "qualified health claim" status to phosphatidylserine thus allowing labels to state "consumption of phosphatidylserine may reduce the risk of dementia and cognitive dysfunction in the elderly" along with the disclaimer "very limited and preliminary scientific research suggests that phosphatidylserine may reduce the risk of cognitive dysfunction in the elderly. FDA concludes that there is little scientific evidence supporting this claim."&lt;ref name="FDAFinalDecisionLetter20030513"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/labelingnutrition/ucm072999.htm |title=Phosphatidylserine and Cognitive Dysfunction and Dementia (Qualified Health Claim: Final Decision Letter) |last=Taylor |first=Christine L.|publisher=Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=May 13, 2003 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/LabelingNutrition/ucm073992.htm#cognitive|title=Summary of Qualified Health Claims Subject to Enforcement Discretion - Qualified Claims About Cognitive Function|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA declared that "based on its evaluation of the totality of the publicly available scientific evidence, the agency concludes that there is not significant scientific agreement among qualified experts that a relationship exists between phosphatidylserine and reduced risk of dementia or cognitive dysfunction".&lt;ref name="FDAFinalDecisionLetter20030513"/&gt; The FDA also noted "Of the 10 intervention studies that formed the basis of FDA's evaluation, all were seriously flawed or limited in their reliability in one or more ways", concluding that "most of the evidence does not support a relationship between phosphatidylserine and reduced risk of dementia or cognitive dysfunction, and that the evidence that does support such a relationship is very limited and preliminary".&lt;ref name="FDAFinalDecisionLetter20030513"/&gt;

Early studies of phosphatidylserine on memory and cognition used a supplement which isolated the molecule from the bovine brain. Currently, most commercially available products are made from cabbage or [[soybean]]s because of concerns about [[mad cow disease]] in bovine brain tissue.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Glenn|title=Can phosphatidylserine improve memory and cognitive function in people with Alzheimer's disease?|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/expert-answers/phosphatidylserine/faq-20057764|website=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=23 August 2014|date=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plant-based products have a similar, but not identical chemical structure to the bovine derived supplements; for example, the FDA notes "the phosphatidylserine molecule from soy lecithin contains mainly polyunsaturated acids, while the phosphatidylserine molecule from bovine brain cortex contains mainly saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids".&lt;ref name="FDAFinalDecisionLetter20030513"/&gt;

A preliminary study in rats in 1999 indicated that the soy derived phosphatidylserine supplement was as effective as the bovine derived supplement in one of three behavioral tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blokland |first=A |author2=Honig W |author3=Brouns F |author4=Jolles J  |title=Cognition-enhancing properties of subchronic phosphatidylserine (PS) treatment in middle-aged rats: comparison of bovine cortex PS with egg PS and soybean PS |journal=Nutrition |volume=15 |issue=10 |date=October 1999 |pmid=10501292 |doi= 10.1016/S0899-9007(99)00157-4|url=http://arno.unimaas.nl/show.cgi?fid=4948 |pages=778–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Treatment of Age-Related Cognitive Decline: Effects of Phosphatidylserine in Anti-Aging Medical Therapeutics | last=Crook | first= T.

===Safety===
Traditionally, PS supplements were derived from bovine cortex (BC-PS). However, due to the risk of potential transfer of infectious diseases, soy-derived PS (S-PS) supplements have been used as an alternative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Soy-derived PS is designated [[Generally Recognized As Safe]] by the FDA.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} A 2002 safety report determined supplementation in elder people at a dosage of 200&amp;nbsp;mg three times daily to be safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jorissen BL, Brouns F, Van Boxtel MP, Riedel WJ |title=Safety of soy-derived phosphatidylserine in elderly people |journal=Nutritional Neuroscience |volume=5 |issue=5 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12385596 |doi= 10.1080/1028415021000033802|url= |pages=337–43|last2=Brouns |last3=Van Boxtel |last4=Riedel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8918">'''Postsecularism''' refers to a range of theories regarding the persistence or [[Growth of religion|resurgence of religious beliefs]] or practices in the present. The "post-" may refer to after the end of secularism or after the beginning of secularism.

== Use ==
The term “postsecular” has been used in sociology, political theory,&lt;ref&gt;Kyrlezhev, Aleksandr. “The Postsecular Age: Religion and Culture Today.” Trans. Joera Mulders and Philip Walters. Religion, State and Society 36.1 (2008): 21-31. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLennan, Gregor. “The Postsecular Turn.” Theory, Culture &amp; Society 27.4 (2010): 3-20. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; religious studies, art studies,&lt;ref&gt;King, Mike. “Art and the Postsecular.” Journal of Visual Art Practice 4.1 (2005): 3-17. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; literary studies,&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Michael. “Locating the Postsecular.” Religion &amp; Literature 41.3 (2009): 67-73. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed, Feisal G. Milton and the Post-Secular Present: Ethics, Politics, Terrorism. Stanford, CA: Stanford UP, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Educational Philosophy for a Post-secular Age|last=Lewin|first=David|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781138923669|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other fields. [[Jürgen Habermas]] is widely credited for popularizing the term,&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen. "Secularism's Crisis of Faith: Notes on Post-Secular Society". ''New perspectives quarterly''. vol. 25 (2008) p.&amp;nbsp;17-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reder, Michael and Josef Schmidt. “Habermas and Religion.” An Awareness of What Is Missing: Faith and Reason in a Post-Secular Age. Jürgen Habermas, et al. Trans. Ciaran Cronin. Cambridge, UK: Polity, 2010. 1-14. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to current times in which the idea of modernity is perceived as failing and, at times, morally unsuccessful, so that, rather than a stratification or separation, a new peaceful dialogue and tolerant coexistence between the spheres of faith and reason&lt;ref&gt;The title of a very recent book of [[Jean-Marc-Ferry]] is ''La Raison et la foi''&lt;/ref&gt; must be sought in order to learn mutually.&lt;ref&gt;Buston, Fernando del. 2014. ''[«El Estado debe proteger a la religión»]''. El Comercio. Date access: January 10, 2015: ''"Jürgen Habermas ha acuñado el término de postsecularidad. Se da por fallida la idea central de la modernidad de que la religión iba a desaparecer y se establece una nueva relación entre razón y religión. Habermas plantea que es necesario emprender un aprendizaje mutuo entre las sociedades modernas y las creencias, o entre razón secular y fe. Se inicia una nueva época de mutuas tolerancias. La razón no puede echar por la borda el potencial de sentido de las religiones y éstas deben traducir sus contenidos racionalmente."''&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, Habermas insists that both religious people and secularist people should not exclude each other, but to learn from one another and coexist tolerantly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resetdoc.org/EN/Habermas-Istanbul.php A “post-secular” society – what does that mean?] by Jurgen Habermas June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Javier Espinosa. ''[http://www.uclm.es/actividades0304/seminarios/spinoza/pdf/cuadernos/22.pdf The religion in the public sphere. Habermas, Toland and Spinoza]''. Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha&lt;/ref&gt; Massimo Rosati says that in a post secular society, religious and secular perspectives are on even ground, meaning that the two theoretically share equal importance. Modern societies that have considered themselves fully secular until recently have to change their value systems accordingly as to properly accommodate this co-existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Making of a Postsecular Society: A Durkheimian Approach to Memory, Pluralism and Religion in Turkey (Classical and Contemporary Social Theory)|last = Rosati|first = Massimo|publisher = Ashgate Publishing Company|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1472423122|location = |pages = 83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Taylor’s ''[[A Secular Age]]'' is also frequently invoked as describing the postsecular,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, James K. A. “Secular Liturgies and the Prospects for a ‘Post-Secular’ Sociology of Religion.” The Post-Secular in Question: Religion in Contemporary Society. Ed. Philip S. Gorski, et al. New York, NY: New York UP 2012. 159-184. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; though there is sometimes disagreement over what each author meant with the term. Particularly contested is the question of whether “postsecular” refers to a new sociological phenomenon or to a new awareness of an existing phenomenon—that is, whether society was secular and now is becoming post-secular or whether society was never and is not now becoming secular even though many people had thought it was or thought it was going to be.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, Rhonda Hustedt, and Douglas G. Jacobsen. “Postsecular America: A New Context for Higher Education.” The American University in a Postsecular Age. Ed. Rhonda Hustedt Jacobsen and Douglas G. Jacobsen. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2008. 3-16. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, Jeffrey K. “Toward Desacralizing Secularization Theory.” Social Forces 65.3 (1987): 587-611. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggest that the term is so conflicted as to be of little use.&lt;ref&gt;Beckford, James A. “Public Religions and the Postsecular: Critical Reflections.” Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 51.1 (2012): 1-19. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest that the flexibility of the term is one of its strengths.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, Allen. “The Precarious Integrity of the Postsecular.” Boundary 2: An International Journal of Literature and Culture 37.3 (2010): 91-99. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In literary studies, the term has been used to indicate a sort of postmodern religious or spiritual sensibility in certain contemporary texts.&lt;ref&gt;McClure, John A..  Partial Faiths: Postsecular Fiction in the Age of Pynchon and Morrison. Athens, GA: U of Georgia P, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''principle of orthogonal design''' (abbreviated POOD) was developed by database researchers [[David McGoveran]] and [[Christopher J. Date]] in the early 1990s, and first published "A New Database Design Principle" in the July 1994 issue of Database Programming and Design and reprinted several times. It is the second of the two principles of [[database design]], which seek to prevent databases from being too complicated or redundant, the first principle being the [[principle of full normalization]] ([[POFN]]).

Simply put, it says that no two relations in a [[relational database]] should be defined in such a way that they can represent the same facts. As with [[database normalization]], POOD serves to eliminate uncontrolled storage redundancy and expressive ambiguity, especially useful for applying updates to virtual relations (e.g., [[view (database)]]). Although simple in concept, POOD is frequently misunderstood and the formal expression of POOD continues to be refined.

The principle is a restatement of the requirement that a database is a minimum cover set of the relational algebra. The relational algebra allows data duplication in the relations that are the elements of the algebra. One of the efficiency requirements of a database is that there be no data duplication. This requirement is met by the minimum cover set of the relational algebra.

'''ProMusa''' is a platform of scientists and other stakeholders to facilitate the exchange of information and knowledge on banana. It is managed by [[Bioversity International]], through funding from the [[CGIAR]] Research Program on Roots, Tubers and Bananas.

== History ==
Promusa was initiated in 1997 by the [[World Bank]] and [[International Network for the Improvement of Banana and Plantain|INIBAP]] as a global program to co-ordinate and improve research on banana improvement. Its aim was to increase interactions between pathologists and the world’s few banana breeders in order to maximize the outputs of breeding and accelerate the impact of banana improvement efforts.

At the start, the program had five interlinked thematic working groups (Genetic Improvement, Fusarium wilt, Sigatoka diseases, Nematodes and Viruses), coordinated by a secretariat which was provided by INIBAP.&lt;ref&gt;Sharrock, S., Orjeda, G. and Frison, E.A. 1998. [http://www.musalit.org/seeMore.php?id=4783  ProMusa - a global programme for Musa improvement]. p.337-344. In: Galán Saúco, V. (ed.). Proceedings of First International Symposium on Banana in the Subtropics, Puerto de la Cruz, Tenerife, Spain, 1997/11/10-14. Acta Horticulturae 490. ISHS, Leuven, Belgium.&lt;/ref&gt; It was directed by a steering committee and operated under a program support group composed of major donors and stakeholders.

In 2006, the program was reorganized into three working groups (Crop Production, Crop Protection and Crop Improvement). Since 2006, ProMusa also provides the basic structure for the Section on Banana and Plantain (SEBA) of the [[International Society for Horticultural Science]] (ISHS).

== Membership and organizational structure ==
Membership to ProMusa is open to anyone interested in banana. ProMusa is overseen by a steering committee composed of the ProMusa coordinator, the chair and vice-chair of each of the three working groups and ISHS-SEBA, a representative of the global ''Musa'' genetic resources network [[MusaNet]] and a representative of each of four regional banana R&amp;D networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promusa.org/article7 http://www.promusa.org/article7]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Bioversity International provides the Secretariat of ProMusa.

== Main activities ==
In alliance with ISHS, ProMusa organizes scientific symposia, oversees the development of an online, collaboratively built and peer-reviewed compendium of knowledge on bananas (Musapedia), and produces a newsletter that puts in context scientific breakthroughs on banana and highlights relevant news and events (InfoMus@).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promusa.org/article8 http://www.promusa.org/article8]&lt;/ref&gt; ProMusa also manages three databases: a repository of references on banana (Musalit); an image bank on banana (Musarama), and a contacts database (Musacontacts).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13364">'''Psychobiography''' aims to understand historically significant individuals, such as [[artist]]s or [[political leader]]s, through the application of [[psychological theory]] and research.

Through its merging of [[personality psychology]] and historical evidence,&lt;ref&gt;B. J. Carducci, ''The Psychology of Personality'' (2009) p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; psychobiography may be considered a historical form of therapeutic [[case study]]: it represents a growing field in the realm of [[biography]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Rollyson, ''Biography'' (2007)   p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; '''Psychopathography''' is sometimes used as a term to indicate that the person being analyzed was not mentally healthy, "path" coming from ''pathos'' (πάθος)—Ancient Greek for suffering or illness. 

==Background==

Psychobiography is a field within the realms of [[psychology]] and [[biography]] that analyzes the lives of historically significant individuals through psychological theory and research. Its goal is to develop a better understanding of notable individuals by [[applied psychology|applying psychological]] theories to their biographies to further explain the motives behind some of the subjects actions and decisions. Popular subjects of psychobiographies include figures such as [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], and [[Saddam Hussein]]. A typical biography is often very descriptive, and tries to record every notable event that happened in a person's lifetime, whereas a psychobiography primarily focuses on some particular events, and tries to better understand why they happened. This field's potential has not only aided in developing a better understanding to many notable biographies throughout history, but has also inspired direction and insight into the field of psychology.

One of the first great examples of this field's utility was Dr. [[Henry Murray]]'s report on the analysis of Adolf Hitler's personality during the end of [[World War II]]. Forced to psychoanalyze from a distance, Dr. Murray used multiple sources, including Hitler's genealogy, Hitler's own writings, and biographies of Hitler, so that the Allied forces could understand his personality to better predict his behavior. By applying a theory of personality that consisted of 20 psychogenic needs, Dr. Murray presumed Hitler's personality as "counteractive narcism", and was able to correctly predict the German leader's suicide in the face of his country's defeat. This work by Dr. Murray not only helped establish personality psychology as a behavioral science, but it also showed how the field of psychobiography could be applied as a means of psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Henry. "The Analysis of The Personality of Adolph Hitler." The Analysis of The personality of Adolph Hitler (1943). N.p., n.d. Web&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and development==

[[Sigmund Freud]]'s analysis of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (titled ''[[Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood]]'') is generally considered the first "modern" psychobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'' (1989) p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;  Persons who have been the subject of psychobiographical research include Freud, [[Adolf Hitler]],&lt;ref&gt;Waite, Robert G.L. ''[[The Psychopathic God: Adolf Hitler]].'' New York: First DaCapo Press Edition, (1993) (orig. pub. 1977). {{ISBN|0-306-80514-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sylvia Plath]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Martin Luther]],&lt;ref&gt;G, R, Elton, ''The Practice of History'' (1969) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],&lt;ref&gt;Safranski, Rüdiger.  ''Nietzsche: a Philosophical Biography'' Granta Books, London, (2002); Vienna, (2000); New York (2002) {{ISBN|0-393-05008-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Jackson]], and [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Barzun/H. F. Graff, ''The Modern Researcher'' (1977) p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

Major psychobiographical authors include [[Erik Erikson]],&lt;ref&gt;Carducci, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; [[James William Anderson]], [[Henry Murray]], [[George Atwood]], and [[William Runyan]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Many psychobiographies are [[Psychoanalysis|Freudian]] or [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] in orientation, but other commonly used theories include narrative models of identity such as the life story model, [[script theory]], [[Object relations theory|object relations]], and [[existentialism]]/[[Existential phenomenology|phenomenology]]; and psychobiographers are increasingly looking for explanatory complexity through an eclectic approach.&lt;ref&gt;Alan C. Elms, ''Uncovering Lives'' (1997) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there were other psychobiographies written before [[Freud]]'s ''Leonardo da Vinci and A Memory of His Childhood'' in 1910, it is considered the most significant contribution of its time, despite its flaws. Psychobiographies about [[William Shakespeare]] (Jones, 1910), [[Giovanni Segantini]] (Abraham, 1912), [[Richard Wagner]] (Graf, 1911), [[Amenhotep IV]] (Abraham, 1912), [[Martin Luther]] (Smith, 1913), and [[Socrates]] (Karpas, 1915) were also published between 1910 and 1915, but are not as well known.&lt;ref name="Runyan"&gt;Runyan, W., M. (1988). Progress in psychobiography. Journal of Personality, 56, 295-326.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1920 and 1926, psychobiographies of [[Margaret Fuller]] (Anthony, 1920), [[Samuel Adams]] (Harlow, 1923), [[Edgar Allan Poe]] (Krutch, 1926), and [[Abraham Lincoln]] (Clark, 1923) were published by authors from a psychoanalytic perspective without a background in psychoanalysis. During the 1930s [[Tolstoy]], [[Dostoevsky]], [[Molière]], [[George Sand|Sand]], [[Goethe]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Nietzsche]], Poe, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Caesar]], Lincoln, [[Napoleon]], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], and [[Alexander the Great]] were the subjects of psychobiographies, and soon afterward in 1943 a psychobiography of [[Adolf Hitler]], predicting his suicide, was written during World War II, but was not published until 1972. Recent, significant contributions between 1960 and 1990 include psychobiographies of [[Henry James]] (Edel, 1953–72), [[Isaac Newton]] (Manuel, 1968), [[Mohandas Gandhi]] (Erikson, 1969), [[Max Weber]] (Mitzman, 1969), [[Emily Dickinson]] (Cody, 1971), [[Joseph Stalin]] (Tucker, 1973), [[James Mill|James]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] ([[Bruce Mazlish|Mazlish]], 1975), [[T. E. Lawrence]] (Mack, 1976), Adolf Hitler (Waite, 1977), [[Beethoven]] (Solomon, 1977), [[Samuel Johnson]] (Bate, 1977), [[Alice James]] (Strouse, 1980), [[Wilhelm Reich]] (Sharaf, 1983), and [[William James]] (Feinstein, 1984).&lt;ref name="Schultz"&gt;Schultz, W., T. (2005). Handbook of psychobiography. New York, NY: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychobiographies at this time were also written about groups of people, focusing on an aspect they had in common such as American presidents, philosophers, utopians, revolutionary leaders, and personality theorists. These psychobiographies are the most well known, but since 1910 there have been over 4000 psychobiographies published.&lt;ref name="Runyan" /&gt;

As psychobiography gained recognition, authors from a variety of professions contributed their own work from alternate perspectives and varying methods of analysis of the psychobiographical subjects, significantly expanding psychobiography beyond the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical perspective]]. Apart from psychoanalysts and [[Psychiatry|psychiatrists]] who wrote the first psychobiographies, there have been historians, [[political science|political scientists]], [[personality psychology|personality psychologists]], literary critics, [[sociology|sociologists]], and [[anthropology|anthropologists]] that have contributed to the growth of the field.&lt;ref name="Runyan" /&gt;
Psychobiography has also conflicted with contemporary views of science since its origin because it contains no controlled variables or experimentation. In its early years it was dismissed as unscientific and not a legitimate addition to the field of [[psychology]] due to the push towards experimentation focused on physiological and biological factors, and away from philosophical psychology, to establish it as a natural science. The value of psychobiography to psychology is comparable to [[evolutionary psychology]], [[archeology]], and [[historical geology]], offering detailed analyses of subjects with an emphasis on contextual information, but due to the qualitative nature of this information it remains a challenge to validate psychobiographical works as empirically based applications of psychology.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;

==Methodology==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}

The discipline of psychobiography has developed various methodological guidelines for psychobiographical study.  Some of the most prominent are these:

# The use of prototypical scenes in the life of the subject to serve as a model of their personality pattern
# The use of a series of indicators of salience, markers such as primacy, frequency, and uniqueness of an event in a life, to identify significant patterns
# The identification of pregnant [[metaphor]]s or images that organize autobiographical narratives
# Logical coherence or consistency as a criterion for adequate psychological interpretations

Scholars untrained in the discipline who do not follow these guidelines continue to produce psychobiographical studies.

==Contributors==

===Sigmund Freud===

Freud's psychoanalytic approach (Freudian perspective) is not commonly used in its entirety in psychobiography, but it has had a lasting influence on the analysis of behavior in other areas of psychology. To sift through a lifetime of information and locate significant areas in the subject's development requires a system of identification, and psychoanalysis provided the base for this. Primacy, the initial exposure or experience, was recognized by Freud as an important factor in personality development and has remained an important aspect of personality psychology, [[psychotherapy]], and psychobiography. Frequency, repeated exposure or actions, is also important, but its significance can vary. If the frequency of an action is low then it is seen as unimportant, and if the frequency is too high it becomes passive and overlooked, also becoming less important in psychobiography. Freud's knowledge of the importance of frequency is shown in the analysis of dreams, slips, errors, and humor by recognizing that repetition leads people to disregard these behaviors or stimuli. The importance of error in psychobiography, including [[Freudian slip|slips]] and distortions, is also rooted in Freudian psychoanalysis and is used to identify hidden motives.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, I., E. (1988). Personality, psychological assessment, and psychobiography. Journal of Personality, 56, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elms===

Elms has contributed to psychobiography through many published works including psychobiographies on [[Gordon Allport|Allport]] (1972), Freud (1980), [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]] (1981), and [[Henry Murray|Murray]] (1987). He has also written about the subject of psychobiography in ''Psychobiography and Case Study Methods'' and ''Uncovering Lives: The Uneasy Alliance of Biography and Psychology'' defining psychobiography and its methods, and explaining the value of psychobiography in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Elms, A. C. (2007). Psychobiography and case study methods. In R. W. Robins, R. C. Fraley, &amp; R. F. Krueger (Eds.), The Handbook of Research Methods in Personality Psychology. New York: Guilford Press, pp. 97-113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elms, A. C. (1994). Uncovering Lives: The Uneasy Alliance of Biography and Psychology. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press. Paperback reprint, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Psychobiography has faced criticism from the very start,&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 312-3&lt;/ref&gt; crystallised above all in the production of what Erikson caricatured as "originology"—the explaining away of significant public events and actions as the product of some minute childhood detail.&lt;ref&gt;Elms, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Bad psychobiography—using mechanical psychologising, a selective mining of the facts,&lt;ref&gt;Barzun, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; overdeterminism, and a tendency to pathologise&lt;ref&gt;Elms, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;—is considered easy to write.  [[Anna Freud]] condemned the study of [[Woodrow Wilson]] Freud himself co-authored with [[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.|William Bullitt]] on just such grounds,&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 559 and 776&lt;/ref&gt; and the haphazard historical evolution of the disciple has not helped reduce its prevalence.&lt;ref&gt;Elms, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1631">'''Ravensborg''', formerly called '''Norstead''', is the name of a replica [[Viking Age]] [[fort]] in northern [[Missouri]] which began construction in the spring of 2007.

[[File:Ravensborg ringfort.jpg|thumb|Ravensborg Viking Ringfort]]

Ravensborg is a type of [[ringfort]] -- a circular earthen rampart and wood palisade with several buildings within. 

While not permanently inhabited, the site is used to recreate a Viking Age fortification allowing [[living history]] enthusiasts to experience Medieval life in a longhouse for short periods. This is a form of [[experimental archeology]] and is expected to shed new light on how ordinary folk lived and functioned in such an environment. The fort contrasts with the temporary tent encampments typically experienced by reenactors.

Various Viking reenactment groups gather here for twice-yearly celebrations in April and October.  Participants are required to wear period clothing, participate in traditional crafts, eat historical foods, and essentially live an [[early Medieval]] lifestyle.  Those trained in live-steel combat techniques may participate in such activities here as well.

The site currently consists of a [[longhouse]], a cookhouse, a forge shelter, gate house, and personal cottages regular visitors have constructed for use by their families and guests. 

The site was renamed "Ravensborg" in 2009.

'''Shoe fetishism''' is the attribution of attractive sexual qualities to [[shoe]]s or other [[footwear]] as a matter of sexual preference, or an alternative or complement to a relationship with a partner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/ World Health Organization, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, (2007), Chapter V, F65.0 Disorders of sexual preference.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Jerome Fagan]].

JHU Press. 2003. {{ISBN|0-8018-7527-7}}. p.78&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been known as '''retifism''', after the French novelist [[Nicolas-Edme Rétif]] (October 23, 1734&amp;ndash;February 2, 1806), also known as [[Rétif de la Bretonne]].  Individuals with shoe fetishism can be erotically interested in women's shoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Prevalence==
In order to determine the relative prevalences of different types of fetishes, scientists obtained a sample of at least 5000 individuals worldwide from 381 Internet discussion groups. The relative prevalences were estimated based on (a) the number of groups devoted to a particular fetish, (b) the number of individuals participating in the groups and (c) the number of messages exchanged. Using these measures, feet and shoes were found to be the most common target of preferences. This is consistent with an analysis of millions of search queries by users from the USA that were accidentally released during the [[AOL search data scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090404124043/http://www.aphrodisiology.com/aol-fetishes AOL search data] (archived link, April 4, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2014}} Sixty-four (64) percent of the sampled population that had a preference for an object associated with the body had a preference for shoes, boots, and other footwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Scorolli | first1 = C. | last2 = Ghirlanda | first2 = S. | last3 = Enquist | first3 = M. | last4 = Zattoni | first4 = S. | last5 = Jannini | first5 = E.

==Popular culture==

In the 19th century, Central European students drank wine or Champagne from their lady's shoe or bootlet as a sign of devotion. The custom is noted in the 1882 opera, ''[[Der Bettelstudent]]'', where Symon drinks Champagne from Laura’s shoe at their wedding. In commemoration of this romantic tradition, the French shoe manufacturer Louboutin issued in 2009, a glass shaped like a woman’s shoe, which was reviewed critically by the German daily, ''[[Die Welt]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.champagnerwelt.com/champagnerhaeuser/piperheidsieck/champagnerauseinenschuhtrinken.html |title=Champagner aus einen Schuh trinken |publisher=Champagnerwelt.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/debatte/kolumnen/Inga_Griese/article6058547/Champagner-nach-Art-des-Schuh-Fetisch.html |title=Kolumne: Inga Griese : Champagner nach Art des Schuh-Fetisch - Nachrichten Debatte - Kolumnen - Inga Griese - DIE WELT |publisher=Welt.de |date=2011-11-23 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Sex and the City]]'' episode, "[[La Douleur Exquise!]]", featured a shoe salesman with a shoe and foot fetish, who allowed [[Charlotte York]] to have expensive shoes for free simply for allowing him to assist her in trying on various pairs of open shoes whilst he openly complimented her on the state of her feet and offered her [[reflexology|foot reflexology]]. The relationship came to an end when Charlotte figured out she had been getting discounts because she was letting him hold her feet and was further discomforted by the salesman obviously [[orgasm|climaxing]] while assisting her with the sixth pair of the day.

The movie ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'' featured a former boyfriend of Mary, Dom "Woogie" Wooganowski, played by [[Chris Elliott]], with a shoe fetish. He tried to steal her shoes.

In the animated comedy show ''[[Family Guy]]'', the character [[Glenn Quagmire]] has a foot and shoe fetish, among other fetishes.

In the 1993 Spanish movie, ''[[The Bilingual Lover]]'', written and directed by [[Vicente Aranda]] from an adaptation from a novel by [[Juan Marsé]], shoe fetishism pervades the whole story.

In the 1995 movie, ''[[While You Were Sleeping (film)|While You Were Sleeping]]'', starring [[Sandra Bullock]], the main character's landlord, played by [[Michael Rispoli]], has a shoe fetish.

In the 2000 Japanese television series, ''[[:ja:バスストップ|Bus Stop]]'', the main character, Musashi, has a strong interest in high heels, and at one point repairs a broken high heel for the woman he is pursuing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10062">The '''Social Support Questionnaire''' (SSQ) is a quantitative, psychometrically sound survey questionnaire intended to measure social support and satisfaction with said social support from the perspective of the interviewee.&lt;ref name="Social Support Questionnaire"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fetzer.org/sites/default/files/images/stories/pdf/selfmeasures/Self_Measures_for_Love_and_Compassion_Research_SOCIAL_SUPPORT.pdf|title=Social Support Questionnaire|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407587044007|title=A Brief Measure of Social Support: Practical and Theoretical Implications|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|doi=10.1177/0265407587044007|volume=4|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|pages=497–510}}&lt;/ref&gt; Degree of [[social support]] has been shown to influence the onset and course of certain psychiatric disorders such as [[clinical depression]] or [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.institute-of-mental-health.jp/thesis/pdf/thesis-04/thesis-04-32.pdf|title=Social Support Questionnaire among psychiatric patients with various diagnoses and normal controls|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The SSQ was approved for public release in 1981 by Irwin Sarason, Henry Levine, Robert Basham and Barbara Sarason under the University of Washington Department of Psychology and consists of 27 questions.&lt;ref name="ADA100464"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA100464|title=ADA100464|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the SSQ has good test-retest reliability and convergent internal construct validity.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ADA100464" /&gt;

==Overview==
The questionnaire is designed so that each question has a two-part answer. The first part asks the interviewee to list up to nine people available to provide support that meet the criteria stated in the question. These support individuals are specified using their initials in addition to the relationship to the interviewee.&lt;ref name="BioPsychoSocial Assessment Tools for the Elderly"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://instruct.uwo.ca/kinesiology/9641/Assessments/Social/SSQ.html|title=BioPsychoSocial Assessment Tools for the Elderly - Assessment Summary Sheet|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Example questions from the first part includes questions such as “Whom could you count on to help if you had just been fired from your job or expelled from school?” and “Whom do you feel would help if a family member very close to you died?”.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt;

The second part asks the interviewee to specify how satisfied they are with each of the people stated in the first part. The SSQ respondents use a 6 -point [[Likert scale]] to indicate their degree of satisfaction with the support from the above people ranging from “1 - very dissatisfied” to “6 - very satisfied”.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt;

The Social Support Questionnaire has multiple short forms such as the SSQ3 and the SSQ6.

==History of the SSQ==
The SSQ is based on 4 original studies. The first study set out to determine whether the SSQ had the desired psychometric properties. The second study tried to relate SSQ and a diversity of personality measures such as [[anxiety]], depression and hostility in connection with the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist. The third study considered the relationship between social support, the prior year’s negative and positive life events, internal-external locus of control and self- esteem in conjunction with the Life Experiences Survey. The fourth study tested the idea that social support could serve as a buffer when faced with difficult life situations via trying to solve a maze and subsequently completing the Cognitive Interference Questionnaire.&lt;ref name="ADA100464" /&gt;

==Scoring==
The overall support score (SSQN) is calculated by taking an average of the individual scores across the 27 items.&lt;ref name="BioPsychoSocial Assessment Tools for the Elderly" /&gt; A high score on the SSQ indicates more optimism about life than a low score. Respondents with low SSQ scores have a higher prevalence of negative life events and illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarason|first=|year=1985|title=Concomitants of Social Support: Social Skills, Physical Attractiveness and Gender|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA141884|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=49|pages=469–480|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.49.2.469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scoring is as follows:

1. Add the total number of people for all 27 items (questions). (Max. is 243). Divide by 27 for average item score. This gives you SSQ Number Score, or SSQN.

2. Add the total satisfaction scores for all 27 items (questions). (Max is 162). Divide by 27 for average item score. This gives you SSQ Satisfaction score or SSQS.

3. Finally, you can average the above for  the total number of people that are family members - this results in the SSQ family score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agedcaretests.com/The_Social_Support_Questionnaire_(SSQ)_SAMPLE.pdf|title=Social Support Questionnaire Sample|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reliability==
According to Sarason, the SSQ takes between fifteen to eighteen minutes to properly administer and has “good” test-retest reliability.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt;

==Validity==
The SSQ was compared with the depression scale and validity tests show significant negative correlation ranging from -0.22 to -0.43. The SSQ and the optimism scale have a correlation of 0.57. The SSQ and the satisfaction score have a correlation of 0.34.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt; The SSQ has high [[internal consistency]] among items.&lt;ref name="ADA100464" /&gt;

==Related Surveys==

=== SSQ3 ===

The SSQ3 is a short form of the SSQ and has only three questions. The SSQ3 has acceptable test-test reliability and correlation with personality variables as compared to the long form of the Social Support Questionnaire. The internal reliability was borderline but this low level of internal reliability is as expected since there are only three questions.&lt;ref name="Social Support Questionnaire" /&gt;

=== SSQ6 ===

The SSQ6 is a short form of the SSQ. The SSQ6 has been shown to have high correlation with: the SSQ, SSQ personality variables and internal reliability. In the development of the SSQ6, the research suggests that professed social support in adults may be a connected to “early attachment experience.”&lt;ref name="Social Support Questionnaire" /&gt; The SSQ6 consists of the below 6 questions:

1. Whom can you really count on to be dependable when you need help?

2. Whom can you really count on to help you feel more relaxed when you are under pressure or tense?

3. Who accepts you totally, including both your worst and your best points?

4. Whom can you really count on to care about you, regardless of what is happening to you?

5. Whom can you really count on to help you feel better when you are feeling generally down-in-the-dumps?

6. Whom can you count on to console you when you are very upset?&lt;ref name="BioPsychoSocial Assessment Tools for the Elderly" /&gt;

===Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL)===

The Interpersonal Support Evaluation List includes 40 items (questions) with four sub-scales in the areas of Tangible Support, Belonging Support, Self-Esteem Support and Appraisal Support. The interviewee rates each item based on how true or false they feel the item is for themselves. The four total response options are “Definitely True”, “Probably True”, “Probably False”, and “Definitely False”.&lt;ref name="Social Support Questionnaire" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2765">A '''sphaeroblast''' is a woody extrusion from the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] or [[branch]] of a [[tree]], usually taking the form of a rounded spherical shape, as if the tree had a boil or mole.&lt;ref&gt;Strouts R G and Winter T G (1994) Diagnosis of ill-health in trees, TSO: London&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Sphaeroblast on weeping beech 02.jpg|thumb|Photograph of a sphaeroblast on the trunk of a weeping beech tree (''Fagus sylvatica'' 'Pendula')]]  

[[File:Sphaeroblast on Fagus 01.jpg|thumb|An image of a sphaeroblast formed on a mature beech tree (''Fagus sylvatica'')]]

Sphaeroblasts originate from a bud initial or a cluster of buds (especially adventitious buds) on the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] or [[branch]] that have abnormally generated a rounded layer of [[cambium]] and then subsequently secondary thickened to produce wood ([[xylem]]), rather than growing shoots or foliage &lt;ref&gt;Watson B (2013) Trees: Their use, management, cultivation &amp; biology, Crowood Press Ltd., England&lt;/ref&gt;.  It is possible that sphaeroblasts are formed in the presence of [[Microorganism|microbes]], as is the case with a [[witch's broom]] formed in a [[tree]], but there has been little scientific research on what causes sphaeroblasts to form and it may be the case that there are a number of different causes of this anomalous growth form, pathogenic or physiological.

Sphaeroblasts are quite common on species of beech (''[[Fagus (plant)|Fagus]]''), holly (''[[Ilex]]''), horse chestnut (''[[Aesculus]]'') and southern beeches (''[[Lophozonia]]''), and also occasionally appear on quite a wide range of other tree species, including [[Pinophyta|conifers]].  They can be of interest to wood carvers, to create unique wooden ornaments.  Their removal from the tree typically causes only a small wound to the trunk or branch, as they are often only superficially attached &lt;ref&gt;Ruhland W ed. (1965) Encyclopedia of Plant Physiology vol. XV: Differentiation and Development, Springer-Verlag: Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sphaeroblasts formed at the base of a southern beech (Lophozonia alpina).jpg|thumb|Sphaeroblasts formed at the base of a southern beech (''Lophozonia alpina'')]] 

There is no known case where the presence of sphaeroblasts has resulted in dieback or structural failure in a living tree.  Sphaeroblasts represent only a very minor distortion of tree growth and are not considered to be a sign of ill-health in a tree.

Various methods and tools are involved in '''stellar age estimation''', an attempt to identify within reasonable degrees of confidence what the age of a star is. These methods include stellar [[stellar evolution|evolutionary models]], membership in a given [[star cluster]] or [[star system|system]], fitting the star with the standard [[stellar classification|spectral and luminosity classification system]], and the presence of a [[protoplanetary disk]], among others. Nearly all of the methods of determining age require knowledge of the mass of the star, which can be known through various methods. No individual method can provide accurate results for all types of stars.&lt;ref name=astroreview&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev-astro-081309-130806|title=The Ages of Stars|year=2010|last1=Soderblom|first1=David R.|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=48|pages=581|arxiv = 1003.6074 |bibcode = 2010ARA&amp;A..48..581S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Luminosity increase and the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram ==
As stars grow older, their luminosity increases at an appreciable rate.&lt;ref name=theuniverse-2011&gt;{{Cite episode

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the mass of the star, one can use this rate of increase in luminosity in order to determine the age of the star. This method only works for calculating stellar age on the [[main sequence]], because in advanced evolutionary stages of the star, such as the [[red giant]] stage, the standard relationship for the determination of age no longer holds. However, when one can observe a red giant star with a known mass, one can calculate the main-sequence lifetime,&lt;ref name=swin-main-seq&gt;{{cite web|title=Main Sequence Lifetime|url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/M/Main+Sequence+Lifetime|work=Swinburne Astronomy Online|publisher=[[Swinburne University of Technology]]|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus the minimum age of star is known given that it is in an advanced stage of its evolution. As the star spends only about 1% of its total lifetime as a red giant,&lt;ref name=swin-red-giant&gt;{{cite web|title=Red giant stars|url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/R/Red+giant+stars|work=Swinburne Astronomy Online|publisher=Swinburne University of Technology|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is an accurate method of determining age.

==Stellar age estimation of stars==
[[File:EtaCarinae.jpg|250px|thumb|Eta Carinae, a star system that is violently ejecting gas.]]Various properties of stars can also be used to determine their age. For example, the [[Eta Carinae]] system is emitting large quantities of gas and dust. These enormous outbursts can be used to infer that the star system is nearing the end of its life, and will explode as a [[supernova]] within a relatively short period of astronomical time.&lt;ref name=apod-2006&gt;{{Cite APOD|title=Doomed Star Eta Carinae|access-date=7 March 2012|date=26 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very large stars like [[VY Canis Majoris]], one of the [[List of largest known stars|largest stars known]], together with [[Mu Cephei]], [[Betelgeuse]] and [[UY Scuti]] all have radii larger than that of the average orbital radius of [[Jupiter]] in the [[Solar System]], thus showing that they are in extremely late evolutionary stages.&lt;ref name=vy-cm&gt;{{cite web|last=Cain|first=Fraser|title=VY Canis Majoris|url=http://www.universetoday.com/65650/vy-canis-majoris/|publisher=[[Universe Today]]|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betelgeuse in particular is expected to die in a supernova explosion within the next million years.&lt;ref name=oneill-betelgeuse&gt;{{cite news|last=Ian|first=O'Neill|title=DON'T PANIC: Betelgeuse Won't Explode in 2012|url=http://news.discovery.com/space/dont-panic-betelgeuse-wont-explode-in-2012.html|publisher=Discovery News|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the scenarios of supermassive stars violently casting off their outer layers before their deaths, other examples can be found of the properties of stars which illustrate their age. For example, [[Cepheid variables]] have a characteristic pattern in their [[lightcurve]]s, the rate of repetition of which is dependent on the luminosity of the star.&lt;ref name=soper-cepheid&gt;{{cite web|last=Soper|first=Davidson E.|title=Cepheid Variable Stars|url=http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~soper/MilkyWay/cepheid.html|work=ASTR 123|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since Cepheid variables are a relatively short evolutionary stage in the lifecycle of stars, and knowing the mass of the star allows for the star to be tracked in its evolutionary path, one can estimate the age of the Cepheid variable.

Exceptional stellar properties which allow for an estimation of age are not confined to advanced evolutionary stages. When a roughly solar-mass star exhibitis [[T Tauri star|T Tauri variability]], astronomers can locate the age of the star as being before the beginning of the [[main sequence]] phase of the star's life.&lt;ref name=cain-622009&gt;{{cite web|last=Cain|first=Fraser|title=T Tauri Star|url=http://www.universetoday.com/24802/t-tauri-star/|publisher=Universe Today|accessdate=7 March 2012|date=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, more massive pre-main-sequence stars could be [[Herbig Ae/Be star]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060917092653/http://astro.berkeley.edu/ay216/NOTES/Lecture27.pdf Herbig Ae/Be stars]&lt;/ref&gt; If a [[red dwarf]] star is emitting immense [[stellar flare]]s and [[x-rays]], the star can be calculated to be in an early stage of its main-sequence lifetime, after which it will become less variable and become stable.&lt;ref name=schirber-2009&gt;{{cite web|last=Schirber|first=Michael|title=Can Life Thrive Around a Red Dwarf Star?|url=http://www.space.com/6560-life-thrive-red-dwarf-star.html|publisher=[[Space.com]]|date=9 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

== Membership in a star cluster or system ==
[[File:47tuc salt.jpg|thumb|250px|[[47 Tucanae]], a [[globular cluster]].]]Membership in a [[star cluster]] or [[star system]] permits an assignment of rough ages to a large number of stars present within. When one can determine the age of stars through other methods, such as the ones listed above, one can identify the age of all of the bodies in a system.&lt;ref name=jiminez-1998&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jiminez|first=Raul|title=Globular cluster ages|date=6 January 1998|volume=95|issue=1|pages=13–17|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/95/1/13.full|accessdate=7 March 2012|pmid=9419317|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pmc=34183|doi=10.1073/pnas.95.1.13|bibcode = 1998PNAS...95...13J }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially useful in clusters of stars which exhibit a large amount of variety in their stellar masses, evolutionary stages, and classifications. While not ''entirely'' independent of the properties of the stars in the cluster, system, or other reasonably-sized association of stars, an astronomer would only need a representative sample of stars to determine the age of the cluster, rather than painstakingly finding the age of every star in the cluster through other properties.

In addition, knowing the age of one member of a star system can help determine the age of that system. In a star system, stars almost always form at the same time as each other, and given the age of one star, the age of all of the others can be known.&lt;ref name=astro-161&gt;{{cite web|title=Binary Star Systems Versus Planetary System|url=http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/solarsys/binary.html|work=Astronomy 161 lectures|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this method does not work for [[galaxies]]. These units are much larger, and are not merely a one-off creation of stars which allows their age to be determined in this fashion. The creation of stars in a galaxy takes place over billions of years,&lt;ref name=utoday-08&gt;{{cite web|last=Wethington|first=Nicholos|title=Age of the Milky Way|url=http://www.universetoday.com/21822/age-of-the-milky-way/|work=Universe Today|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though star production may long since have ceased (see [[elliptical galaxy]]). The oldest stars in a galaxy can only set a minimum age for the galaxy (when star formation began) but by no means determine the actual age.&lt;ref name=wethington-2008-2&gt;{{cite web|last=Wethington|first=Nicholos|title=Facts about the Milky Way|url=http://www.universetoday.com/22285/facts-about-the-milky-way/|work=Universe Today|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presence of a protoplanetary disk ==
{{see also|Protoplanetary disk}}
Along with other factors, the presence of a [[protoplanetary disk]] sets a maximum limit on the age of stars. Stars with protoplanetary disks are typically young, having moved onto the main sequence only a relatively short time ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Initial Conditions of Planet Formation: Lifetimes of Primordial Disks|author=Mamajek, E.E.|year=2009|journal=AIP Conference Proceedings|volume=1158|pages=3–10|bibcode=2009AIPC.1158....3M|doi=10.1063/1.3215910|last2=Usuda|first2=Tomonori|last3=Tamura|first3=Motohide|last4=Ishii|first4=Miki|ref=harv|arxiv = 0906.5011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, this disk would coalesce to form [[planets]], with leftover material being deposited into various [[asteroid belt]]s and other similar locations. However, the presence of [[pulsar planet]]s complicates this method as a determinant of age.

Gyro-chronology is a method used to determine the age of [[field stars]] by measuring their rotation rate, and then comparing this rate with the rotation rate of the Sun, which serves as a precalibrated clock for this measurement.&lt;ref name=astrobio&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/2315/gyrochronology | title=Gyrochronology | work=Astrobiology Magazine | accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method has been seen as a more accurate method for the determination of stellar ages than other methods for field stars.&lt;ref name=astrobio /&gt;

The '''Synthetic Biology Open Language''' (SBOL)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL)|url=http://sbolstandard.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a proposed data standard for exchanging [[synthetic biology]] designs between software packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galdzicki|first1=Michal|last2=Clancy|first2=Kevin P|last3=Oberortner|first3=Ernst|last4=Pocock|first4=Matthew|last5=Quinn|first5=Jacqueline Y|last6=Rodriguez|first6=Cesar A|last7=Roehner|first7=Nicholas|last8=Wilson|first8=Mandy L|last9=Adam|first9=Laura|last10=Anderson|first10=J Christopher|last11=Bartley|first11=Bryan A|last12=Beal|first12=Jacob|last13=Chandran|first13=Deepak|last14=Chen|first14=Joanna|last15=Densmore|first15=Douglas|last16=Endy|first16=Drew|last17=Grünberg|first17=Raik|last18=Hallinan|first18=Jennifer|last19=Hillson|first19=Nathan J|last20=Johnson|first20=Jeffrey D|last21=Kuchinsky|first21=Allan|last22=Lux|first22=Matthew|last23=Misirli|first23=Goksel|last24=Peccoud|first24=Jean|last25=Plahar|first25=Hector A|last26=Sirin|first26=Evren|last27=Stan|first27=Guy-Bart|last28=Villalobos|first28=Alan|last29=Wipat|first29=Anil|last30=Gennari|first30=John H|last31=Myers|first31=Chris J|last32=Sauro|first32=Herbert M|title=The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) provides a community standard for communicating designs in synthetic biology|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=6 June 2014|volume=32|issue=6|pages=545–550|doi=10.1038/nbt.2891|pmid=24911500}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been under development by the SBOL Developers Group since 2008. This group aims to develop the standard in a way that is open and democratic in order to include as many interests as possible and to avoid domination by a single company. The group also aims to develop and improve the design standard over time as the field of synthetic biology reflects this development.

A graphical language called SBOL visual has also been created to visualize SBOL designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quinn|first1=Jacqueline Y.|last2=Cox|first2=Robert Sidney|last3=Adler|first3=Aaron|last4=Beal|first4=Jacob|last5=Bhatia|first5=Swapnil|last6=Cai|first6=Yizhi|last7=Chen|first7=Joanna|last8=Clancy|first8=Kevin|last9=Galdzicki|first9=Michal|last10=Hillson|first10=Nathan J.|last11=Le Novère|first11=Nicolas|last12=Maheshwari|first12=Akshay J.|last13=McLaughlin|first13=James Alastair|last14=Myers|first14=Chris J.|last15=P|first15=Umesh|last16=Pocock|first16=Matthew|last17=Rodriguez|first17=Cesar|last18=Soldatova|first18=Larisa|last19=Stan|first19=Guy-Bart V.|last20=Swainston|first20=Neil|last21=Wipat|first21=Anil|last22=Sauro|first22=Herbert M.|title=SBOL Visual: A Graphical Language for Genetic Designs|journal=PLOS Biology|date=3 December 2015|volume=13|issue=12|pages=e1002310|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002310|pmid=26633141|pmc=4669170}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) standard visual symbols.png|thumb|300x300px|Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) standard visual symbols]]

The '''Thames Discovery Programme''' is a [[community archaeology]] project, focusing on the archaeology of the River [[Thames]] on the [[Tideway]]. The Thames Discovery Programme (TDP) was launched in October 2008 and until September 2011, the project was supported by the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] and a grant from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hlf.org.uk/Pages/Home.aspx |title=Heritage Lottery Fund |publisher=Hlf.org.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211220147/http://www.hlf.org.uk/Pages/Home.aspx |archivedate=11 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is designed to communicate an understanding and informed enjoyment of the historic Thames to the widest possible audience, and to train and support members of the public (the Foreshore Recording and Observation Group or FROG) to monitor and record the [[archaeology]] of the foreshore during the lifetime of the project, and into the future.

The project builds on initiatives pioneered by the Museum of London’s Thames Archaeological Survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/riverpedia/the-thames-archaeological-survey |title=Thames Archaeological Survey |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=12 February 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that took place from 1993–1999, the work of commercial archaeological units, such as [[Museum of London Archaeology Service|Museum of London Archaeology]]&lt;ref name="museumoflondonarchaeology1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflondonarchaeology.org.uk/|title=Museum of London Archaeology |publisher=museumoflondonarchaeology.org.uk |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Thames Explorer Trust’s innovative education projects. Over three years, archaeologists from the programme surveyed 20 archaeological sites along the tidal Thames in the Greater London area, supported by the work of the Foreshore Recording and Observation Group or FROG,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/about/the_frog |title=The FROG |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=1 January 2010 |accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who monitor the surveyed sites for changes, as the daily tides scour away the remaining archaeological features. The FROG is made up of volunteer members of the public, who are trained in foreshore recording techniques, the history and archaeology of the River Thames, health and safety and participation in digital media by the TDP team.

The TDP currently has a small staff team and is hosted by [[Museum of London Archaeology Service|Museum of London Archaeology]].&lt;ref name="museumoflondonarchaeology1"/&gt; Other partners and supporters include the Thames Explorer Trust,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thames-explorer.org.uk/ |title=Thames Explorer Trust |publisher=Thames-explorer.org.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Museum of London]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/ Museum of London] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222235451/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/ |date=22 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Port of London Authority]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Port of London – www.pla.co.uk |url=http://www.pla.co.uk/ |title=Port of London Authority |publisher=Pla.co.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[English Heritage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/ |title=English Heritage |publisher=English Heritage |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University College London]] [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/ |title=Institute of Archaeology |publisher=Ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cohen |first= Nathalie |authorlink= |author2=Gustav Milne |author3=Eliott Wagg  |date= 2012-12-01|title=The Thames Discovery Programme: Public Engagement and Research on London’s Foreshore |journal=Archaeology International |volume= 15 |issue= |pages= 99–106 |id= |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5334/ai.1506 |doi=10.5334/ai.1506|pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discoveries ==
[[File:Recording the causeway at Isleworth.JPG|thumb|Recording the causeway at Isleworth]]
Using data generated by the Thames Archaeological Survey, the Thames Discovery Programme selected twenty key sites across the [[Greater London]] area for further recording and on-going monitoring during 2008 - 2011. The first site chosen was [[Custom House, City of London|Custom House, London]]; in February 2009, FROG members recorded the causeway, parts of the 1819 riverside wall, the Custom House [[gridiron plan|gridiron]], the remains of two [[ship|vessels]] partly buried on the foreshore and a multi-phase [[revetment]] structure located under [[Billingsgate]] Wharf.

In April 2009, an examination of access to the foreshore at [[Isleworth]] included recording the 20th century boat [[slipway]] and the remains of the Victorian ‘Church Ferry’ [[causeway]].

During low tides in June and July 2009, survey and recording at [[Charlton, London]], formerly the location of Castle’s Shipbreakers Yard focused on the ‘stack’ of very large ships timbers surviving at the top of the foreshore which represent the remains of one or more [[warship]] class vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23724819-volunteers-hunt-bank-of-thames-for-clues-of-lost-victorian-warships.do |title=Volunteers hunt bank of Thames for clues of lost Victorian warships |work=Evening Standard |location=London |date=28 July 2009 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nautical]] remains are very well represented at this site where, in addition to the ‘stack’, we have also discovered a slipway constructed of reused ship and boat timbers, as well as the remains of at least three smaller vessels. During the 2009 Summer Season, teams worked at Alderman Stairs (near [[St Katharine Docks]]), [[Putney]] and [[Bermondsey]]. In November 2009, the first FROG-led project at Carrara Wharf in [[Fulham]] recorded part of the 1729 bridge to [[Putney]], while a TDP survey earlier in the year on the foreshore in front of [[Fulham Palace]] found [[Iron Age]] timber piles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shepherdsbush.ealinggazette.co.uk/2009/11/fulham-foreshore-reveals-ancie.html |title=Fulham foreshore reveals ancient secrets |publisher=Shepherdsbush.ealinggazette.co.uk |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During January 2010, investigations on the [[Isle of Dogs]] with the Thames and Field Metal Detecting Society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesandfield.com/ |title=Thames and Field Metal Detecting Society |publisher=Thamesandfield.com |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered the remains of a human skeleton, dating to the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/discoveries-on-the-isle-of-dogs |title=Discoveries on the Isle of Dogs |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=7 January 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tower Buckle.jpg|thumb|left|A buckle found on the Tower of London foreshore in July 2010]]
During the 2010 Summer Season, work continued on the [[Isle of Dogs]], recording the remains of the slipways used during the launch of the [[SS Great Eastern]], the last project of engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]. In July 2010, the TDP team and the FROG worked on the foreshore at the [[Tower of London]], undertaking survey and recording of an area normally closed to the public. Sections of the riverside wall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/tower-of-london-fieldwork-report |title=Tower of London Fieldwork Report |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=4 August 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; were recorded and data collected to create a contour survey of the foreshore surface. 

The team also worked with members of the Society of Thames Mudlarks and the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finds.org.uk/ |title=Portable Antiquities Scheme |publisher=Finds.org.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to record artefacts found on the surface. The TDP field team then moved to [[Greenwich]] where the riverside wall was again examined, together with parts of a Tudor timber jetty and a newly discovered medieval structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/greenwich-fieldwork-report |title=Greenwich Fieldwork Report |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=11 September 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project also featured on the BBC's [[Digging for Britain]]. During late August 2010, work was undertaken at two sites in West London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/strand-on-the-green-frog-report |title=Strand on the Green Report |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=23 September 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in September, fieldwork was undertaken at Tripcockness near the [[Royal Arsenal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/ballast-blog |title=Tripcockness Fieldwork Report |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=12 September 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rotherhithe]].

In January 2011, the project published the results of recent investigations at Vauxhall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/london-s-oldest-find-discovered-at-vauxhall |title=Vauxhall discoveries |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=6 January 2011 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the remains of the oldest structure so far discovered in the London area, dating to the late Mesolithic period, have been recorded by the Thames Discovery Programme, English Heritage and the Museum of London.

During the 2011 summer field season, the TDP worked at [[Brentford]], recording the remains of two vessels abandoned on the foreshore, and at [[Wapping]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/raindrops-keep-falling |title=Raindrops keep falling |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=9 August 2011 |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; surveying the watermans' causeway and nautical remains. Further fieldwork was also undertaken at Greenwich&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/greenwich-fieldwork-update|title=Greenwich fieldwork update |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=12 June 2011 |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the Tower of London foreshore.

== Outreach and events ==
[[File:Recording the gridiron at Custom House, London.jpg|thumb|Recording the gridiron at Custom House]]
The Thames Discovery Programme runs a programme of events and activities designed to engage the public with the archaeology and history of the river. [[Outreach]] activities undertaken by the project including public lectures, small exhibitions, information stands, guided walks on the foreshore, observation of the FROG members in action on site and events for families and school groups, seminars, workshops and conferences. 

In 2009 the Thames Discovery Programme worked with a number of different organisations including Fulham Palace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fulhampalace.org/ |title=Fulham Palace |publisher=Fulham Palace |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historic Royal Palaces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrp.org.uk/ |title=Historic Royal Palaces |publisher=Hrp.org.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunnersbury Park Museum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hounslow.info/arts/gunnersburyparkmuseum/ |title=Gunnersbury Park |publisher=Hounslow.gov |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camden Young Archaeologists Club,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camdenyoungarchaeologists.org.uk/default.asp Camden Young Archaeologists Club] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325072443/http://www.camdenyoungarchaeologists.org.uk/default.asp |date=25 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the University of East London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uel.ac.uk/ |title=University of East London |publisher=Uel.ac.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thames Explorer Trust, Thames Estuary Partnership, the London Archaeological Archive and Research Centre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/Collections-Research/LAARC/ |title=LAARC |publisher=museumoflondon.org.uk |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Worshipful Company of Antiquarian Collectors, the Museum of London and [[Museum in Docklands]].   During 2010 and 2011, the team again worked with a number of different organisations including the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] at [[Rainham Marshes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves/guide/r/rainhammarshes/ |title=RSPB Rainham |publisher=Rspb.org.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discover Greenwich,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldroyalnavalcollege.org/discover-greenwich/ |title=Discover Greenwich |publisher=Oldroyalnavalcollege.org |date=23 March 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107003836/http://www.oldroyalnavalcollege.org/discover-greenwich/ |archivedate=7 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historic Royal Palaces at the [[Tower of London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrp.org.uk/TowerOfLondon/ |title=Tower of London |publisher=hrp.org.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Southwark Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cathedral.southwark.anglican.org/ |title=Southwark Cathedral |publisher=cathedral.southwark.anglican.org |year=2012 |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The project also featured in the Archaeology in Action gallery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/London-Wall/Whats-on/Exhibitions-Displays/Archaeology-in-Action.htm |title=Archaeology in Action |publisher=museumoflondon.org.uk |accessdate=30 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231193716/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/London-Wall/Whats-on/Exhibitions-Displays/Archaeology-in-Action.htm |archivedate=31 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Museum of London]]. Thousands of members of the public have visited the [[foreshore]] and attended other events, particularly during the two-week [[Festival of British Archaeology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://festival.britarch.ac.uk/ |title=Festival of British Archaeology |publisher=Festival.britarch.ac.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; coordinated by the [[Council for British Archaeology]] in July each year. In July 2009, the Thames Discovery Programme celebrated the Festival at Fulham Palace and on the foreshore&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://festival.britarch.ac.uk/blog |title=Thames Discovery at Fulham Palace |publisher=Festival.britarch.ac.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303222307/http://festival.britarch.ac.uk/blog |archivedate=3 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 the team were at the [[Tower of London]], [[Hall Place]] and the Museum of London.

'''''The Banquet of Cleopatra''''' is the title of several works showing the culmination of a wager between [[Cleopatra]] and [[Mark Antony]] as to which one could provide the most expensive feast. As recounted in [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny the Elder's]] ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' she wins the wager: after Mark Antony's feast, Cleopatra drops a rare and precious pearl from her earring into a cup of vinegar and drinks it once the pearl has dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;Ullman B.L., [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/journals/CJ/52/5/Cleopatras_Pearls*.html "Cleopatra's Pearls"], web reprint of article from ''[[The Classical Journal]]'', Vol. 52, No. 5 (Feb. 1957), 193‑201&lt;/ref&gt;  The third person at the table is [[Lucius Munatius Plancus]], at the time Antony's ally, who was to decide the winner of the wager.&lt;ref name="Christiansen, 152"&gt;Christiansen, 152&lt;/ref&gt;

Most notable is the [[The Banquet of Cleopatra (Tiepolo)|treatment by Tiepolo]], though the subject was also painted by various artists, especially in Italian palace decoration and in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]], with [[The Banquet of Cleopatra (Jordaens)|a version by Jacob Jordaens]] (1653, [[Hermitage Museum]]); one by [[Gérard de Lairesse]] (late 1670s, [[Rijksmuseum]]); two versions by [[Jan de Bray]], using his own family, including himself, as models ([[Royal Collection]], 1652, and [[Currier Museum of Art]], [[New Hampshire]], 1669).  In between the two versions most of those depicted had died in an outbreak of plague, making the later version largely a memorial portrait.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Lloyd (art historian)|Christopher Lloyd]], ''Enchanting the Eye, Dutch Paintings of the Golden Age'', pp. 49–52, Royal Collection Publications, 2004, {{ISBN|1-902163-90-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists included [[Gerard Hoet]], who painted three versions of the subject in the early 18th century (two are in the [[Getty Center]] and [[Bayreuth]], Germany).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=563 "The Banquet of Cleopatra"], J Paul Getty Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

In both the Italian and northern traditions the subject fitted well into existing genres showing lavish dining, with the added attraction of making a more prestigious [[history painting]] with an impeccable and exotic classical origin.  It often formed part of cycles on Antony and Cleopatra with other subjects including the ''Meeting of Cleopatra and Mark Anthony'', the ''Death of Cleopatra'', and sometimes her meetings with [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Octavian]].

==Early life==
Robbins was born as Anthony J. Mahavoric in [[North Hollywood, California]], on February 29, 1960.&lt;ref name="fortune"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Brian |last=O'Keefe |date=October 31, 2014 |title=Tony Robbins, The CEO Whisperer |magazine=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |url=http://fortune.com/2014/10/30/tony-robbins-best-advice-executive-coach/ |accessdate=November 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Robbins is the eldest of three children and his parents divorced when he was 7. His mother then remarried (more than once), including a marriage with Jim Robbins, a former semi-professional baseball player who legally adopted Anthony when he was 12.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2014/10/30/tony-robbins-best-advice-executive-coach/|title=Tony Robbins, The CEO Whisperer|last=O'Keefe|first=Brian|website=Fortune|access-date=June 29, 2017|date=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tony Robbins was raised in [[Glendora, California|Glendora]], California, and attended [[Glendora High School]]. He was elected student body president in his senior year. While growing up, Robbins worked as a handyman to help provide for his siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-10-01/news/vw-3520_1_tony-robbins/3|title=A True Believer: Tony Robbins Has Attracted Converts – and Critics – to His Positive-Thinking Empire|last=Granberry|first=Michael|date=October 1, 1991|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=June 29, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During high school, Robbins grew ten inches, a growth spurt later attributed to a [[pituitary tumor]].&lt;ref name="fortune" /&gt; He has said his home life was "chaotic" and "abusive". When he was seventeen years old, he left home and never returned.&lt;ref name="fortune" /&gt; Robbins later worked as a janitor, and did not attend college.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe"/&gt;

==Career==
Robbins began his career promoting seminars for [[motivational speaker]] and author [[Jim Rohn]] when he was 17 years old.&lt;ref name="Robbins 1987 p.409"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motivationlife.com/?p=27 |title=Anthony Robbins: A true motivation life |accessdate=December 31, 2009 |publisher=MotivationLife |author=Rolando Ponce de Leon |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016135441/http://motivationlife.com/?p=27 |archivedate=October 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.success-guide.com/tony-robbins-tribute-jim-rohn/|title=Tony Robbins tribute to Jim Rohn - Success Guide|website=www.success-guide.com|language=en-US|access-date=July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.success.com/mobile/article/who-inspires-tony-robbins|title=Who Inspires Tony Robbins?|date=November 17, 2016|work=SUCCESS|access-date=July 2, 2017|language=en|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710100055/http://www.success.com/mobile/article/who-inspires-tony-robbins|archivedate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, soon after meeting [[Neurolinguistic Programming]] co-founder [[John Grinder]], the two became partners. At this time Robbins taught NLP and [[Ericksonian hypnosis|Ericksonian Hypnosis.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1983 Robbins learned to firewalk, and incorporated it into his seminars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Awaken the Giant Within: How to Take Immediate Control of Your Mental, Emotional, Physical and Financial Destiny|last=Robbins|first=Tony|publisher=Free Press|year=2007|isbn=0-671-79154-0|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Robbins released his first infomercial, Personal Power, produced by [[Guthy Renker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Guthy-Renker Corporation," International Directory of Company Histories.|last=Brynildssen|first=Shawna|last2=Smith|first2=Dawn M.|publisher=St. James Press|year=2011|isbn=|edition=Karen Hill|volume=119|location=Detroik|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which helped to promote his services as a "peak performance coach". The infomercial helped Robbins gain wide exposure, selling his Personal Power self-help [[audiotapes]]. His early infomercials featured celebrities such as [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] [[quarterback]] [[Fran Tarkenton]] and actor [[Martin Sheen]]. By 1991 an estimated 100 million Americans in 200 media markets had seen his infomercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-10-01/news/vw-3520_1_tony-robbins/3|title=A True Believer :  Tony Robbins Has Attracted Converts--and Critics--to His Positive-Thinking Empire|last=GRANBERRY|first=MICHAEL|date=October 1, 1991|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=July 2, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Robbins began the Leadership Academy seminar.&lt;ref name="Robbins12"&gt;{{cite book|last = Robbins|first = Anthony|title = Leadership Academy Manual|publisher = Robbins Research International, Inc.|location = San Diego, California| year = 2005|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aisucces.ro/tony-robbins-biography/|title=Who is Tony Robbins? • AISUCCES|work=AISUCCES|access-date=July 2, 2017|language=ro-RO}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a speaker on the seminar circuit sponsored by [[Learning Annex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.learningannex.com/default.taf?cat=about_us|title=The Learning Annex {{!}} Online Classes {{!}} Adult Education {{!}} About Us|website=www2.learningannex.com|access-date=July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robbins was a featured speaker at the 2007 [[TED (conference)|Technology, Entertainment and Design (TED) conference]]. Approximately 4 million people have attended his live seminars.

Together with [[Cloé Madanes]], Robbins founded the Robbins-Madanes Center for Intervention, an organization that trains life skills coaches to help families and individuals deal with addiction and other issues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/207396|title=From addict to leader|website=Israel National News|access-date=July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Robbins, along with a group of investors including [[Magic Johnson]], [[Mia Hamm]], and [[Peter Guber]], acquired rights to launch a [[Major League Soccer]] franchise in [[Los Angeles, California]], currently referred to as the [[Los Angeles Football Club]].

He went on to tell a story about a "very powerful man" who passed on hiring a female candidate even though she was the most qualified because she was too attractive and would be "too big a risk".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Following criticism for these comments, Robbins posted an apology on his Facebook page, saying 'I apologize for suggesting anything other than my profound admiration for the #MeToo movement.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reimel|first1=Erin|title=Popular Life Coach Tony Robbins Tried to Mansplain #MeToo—and Movement Founder Tarana Burke Responded|url=https://www.glamour.com/story/tony-robbins-metoo-burke-response|website=Glamour.com|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37806">'''Traditional ecological knowledge''' ('''TEK''') describes indigenous and other forms of traditional knowledge regarding sustainability of local resources. As a field of study in anthropology, TEK refers to "a cumulative body of knowledge, belief, and practice, evolving by  accumulation of TEK and handed down through generations through traditional songs, stories and beliefs. It is concerned with the relationship of living beings (including human) with their traditional groups and with their environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkes|first=F.|date=1993|title=Traditional ecological knowledge in perspective|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/52/5/432/236145|journal=Traditional Ecological Knowledge: Concepts and Cases|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such knowledge is commonly used in [[natural resource management]] as a substitute for baseline environmental data to measure changes over time in remote regions that have little recorded scientific data.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, M.M.R. 1992. The nature and utility of traditional ecological knowledge. ''Northern Perspectives'', 20(1):9-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of traditional knowledge in this field in management and science is controversial since methods of acquiring and accumulating the knowledge, although often including forms of [[empirical research]] and [[experimentation]], differ from those used to create and [[Validity (logic)|validate]]  [[ecology|scientific ecological knowledge]] .&lt;ref&gt;McGregor, D. (2004). Coming full circle: indigenous knowledge, environment, and our future. ''American Indian Quarterly'', 28(3 &amp; 4), 385-410&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Becker, C. D., Ghimire, K. (2003). Synergy between traditional ecological knowledge and conservation science supports forest preservation in Ecuador. ''Conservation Ecology'', 8(1): 1&lt;/ref&gt; Non-tribal government agencies, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency have established integration programs with some tribal governments in order to utilize TEK in environmental plans and climate change tracking.

There is a debate whether   Indigenous populations retain an [[intellectual property]] right over traditional knowledge and whether use of this knowledge requires prior permission and license.&lt;ref&gt;Simeone, T. (2004). Indigenous traditional knowledge and intellectual property rights. Library of Parliament: PRB 03-38E. Parliamentary Research Branch Political and Social Affairs Division.&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially complicated because TEK is most frequently preserved as [[oral tradition]] and as such may lack [[objectivity (science)|objectively]] confirmed [[documentation]]. Ironically, those same methods that might resolve the issue of documentation compromise the very nature of traditional knowledge.

Traditional knowledge is often used to sustain local populations and maintain resources necessary for survival.&lt;ref&gt;AAAS - Science and Human Rights Program. 2008. 10 February 2009 &lt;http://shr.aaas.org/tek/connection.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it can be weakened or invalidated in the context of rapid [[climate change]], [[Environmental degradation|environmental impact]], or other situations in which significant alterations of [[ecosystem]]s render it weak or obsolete {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.

TEK can also be referred to as '''traditional environmental knowledge''' which emphasizes the different components and interactions of the environment. More specifically it contains the knowledge of species of both animals and plants, and biophysical characteristics of the environment through space and time.

== Development of the field ==
{{close paraphrasing|section|date=April 2017}}
The earliest systematic studies of traditional ecological knowledge were conducted in anthropology. Ecological knowledge was studied through the lens of ethnoecology, "an approach that focuses on the conceptions of ecological relationships held by a people or a culture," in understanding how systems of knowledge were developed by a given culture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.umac.mo/ebooks/b10756577a.pdf|title=Traditional Ecological Knowledge in Perspective|last=Berkes|first=Fikret|date=1993|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold C. Conklin|Harold Colyer Conklin]], an American anthropologist who pioneered the study of [[ethnoscience]], took the lead in documenting indigenous ways of understanding the natural world. Conklin and others documented how traditional peoples, such as Philippine horticulturists, displayed remarkable and exceptionally detailed knowledge about the natural history of places where they resided. Direct involvement in gathering, fashioning products from, and using local plants and animals created a scheme in which the biological world and the cultural world were tightly intertwined. Although the field of TEK began with documentation of lists of species used by different indigenous groups and their "taxonomies of plants, animals, and later, of other environmental features such as soils," the shift from documentation to consideration of functional relationships and mechanisms gave rise to the field as it is recognized today. In emphasizing the study of adaptive processes, which argues that social organization itself is an ecological adaptational response by a group to its local environment, human-nature relations and the practical techniques on which these relationships and culture depended, the field of TEK could analyze a broad range of questions related to [[cultural ecology]] and [[ecological anthropology]], .&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://umanitoba.ca/institutes/natural_resources/canadaresearchchair/Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%20And%20Nature%20Traditional%20Ecological%20Knowledge.pdf|title=Traditional Ecological Knowledge|last=Berkes|first=Fikret|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid 1980s a growing body of literature on traditional ecological knowledge documented both the environmental knowledge held by   diverse indigenous peoples and their ecological relations.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The studies included examining "cultivation and biodiversity conservation in tropical ecosystems, and traditional knowledge and management systems in coastal fisheries and lagoons, semi-arid areas, and the Arctic." What these studies illustrated was that a variety of "traditional peoples had their own understandings of ecological relationships and distinct traditions of resource management." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The rise of traditional ecological knowledge at this time led to international recognition of its potential applications in resource management practices and sustainable development. The 1987 report by the World Commission on Environment and Development reflects the consensus at the time. The report points out that the successes of the 20th century (decreases in infant mortality, increases in life expectancy, increases in literacy, and global food production) have given rise to trends that have caused environmental decay "in an ever more polluted world among ever decreasing resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/our-common-future.pdf|title=Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development: Our Common Future|last=|first=|date=March 20, 1987|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hope, however, existed for traditional lifestyles. The report declared that tribal and indigenous peoples had lifestyles that could provide modern societies with lessons in the management of resources in complex forest, mountain, and dryland ecosystems.

=== Differences  from science===
Fulvio Mazzocchi of the [[National Research Council (Italy)|Italian National Research Council]]'s Institute of Atmospheric Pollution contrasts traditional knowledge from scientific knowledge as follows:

{{quote|Traditional knowledge has developed a concept of the environment that emphasizes the symbiotic character of humans and nature. It offers an approach to local development that is based on co‐evolution with the environment, and on respecting the carrying capacity of ecosystems. This knowledge—based on long‐term empirical observations adapted to local conditions—ensures a sound use and control of the environment, and enables indigenous people to adapt to environmental changes. Moreover, it supplies much of the world's population with the principal means to fulfil their basic needs, and forms the basis for decisions and strategies in many practical aspects, including interpretation of meteorological phenomena, medical treatment, water management, production of clothing, navigation, agriculture and husbandry, hunting and fishing, and biological classification systems.... Beyond its obvious benefit for the people who rely on this knowledge, it might provide humanity as a whole with new biological and ecological insights; it has potential value for the management of natural resources, and might be useful in conservation education as well as in development planning and environmental assessment....Western science is positivist and materialist in contrast to traditional knowledge, which is spiritual and does not make distinctions between empirical and sacred. Western science is objective and quantitative as opposed to traditional knowledge, which is mainly subjective and qualitative. Western science is based on an academic and literate transmission, while traditional knowledge is often passed on orally from one generation to the next by the elders.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazzocchi|first=Fulvio|date=2006-05-01|title=Western science and traditional knowledge|url=http://embor.embopress.org/content/7/5/463|journal=EMBO Reports|language=en|volume=7|issue=5|pages=463–466|doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400693|issn=1469-221X|pmc=1479546|pmid=16670675}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Aspects of traditional ecological knowledge ==
The aspects of traditional ecological knowledge provide different typologies in how it is utilized and understood. These are good indicators in how it is used from different perspectives and how they are interconnected, providing more emphasis on "cooperative management to better identify areas of difference and convergence when attempting to bring two ways of thinking and knowing together."&lt;ref&gt;Houde, N. (2007) Ecology &amp; Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factual observations ===
The first aspect of traditional ecological knowledge incorporates the factual, specific observations generated by recognition, naming, and classification of discrete components of the environment.  This aspect is about understanding the interrelationship with species and their surrounding environment. It is also a set of both empirical observations and information emphasizing the aspects of animals and their behavior, and habitat, and the physical characteristics of species, and animal abundance. This type of "empirical knowledge consists of a set of generalized observations conducted over a long period of time and reinforced by accounts of other TEK holders."&lt;ref&gt;Usher, P.J. 2000. Traditional Ecological Knowledge in environmental assessment and management&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management systems===
The second aspect refers to the ethical and sustainable use of resources in regards to management systems. This is achieved through strategic planning to ensure resource conservation. More specifically this face involves  dealing with pest management, resource conversion, multiple cropping patterns, and methods for estimating the state of resources.&lt;ref&gt;Berkes 1988, Gunn et all. 1988&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of ignorance toward traditional ecological knowledge is at the fault of management, these people are used to growing up in a more modern advanced system, they tend to ignore it.

===Past and current uses===
The  third face refers to time dimension aspect of traditional ecological knowledge, focusing on the past and current uses of the environment transmitted through oral history.&lt;ref&gt;Usher 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Oral history is also used to transmit cultural heritage through generation to generation to maintain the sense of family and community.

===Ethics and values===
The fourth face refers to value statements and connections between the belief system and the organization of facts. In regards to TEK it refers to environmental ethics that keeps exploitative abilities in check. This face also refers to the expression of values concerning the relationship with the habitats of species and their surrounding environment - the human-relationship environment.

===Culture and identity===
The fifth face refers to the role of language and images of the past giving life to culture.&lt;ref&gt;Houde 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between Aboriginals (original inhabitants) and their environment are vital to sustaining the cultural components that define them. This face reflects the stories, values, and social relations that reside in places as contributing to the survival, reproduction, and evolution of aboriginal cultures, and identities. It also stresses "the restorative benefits of cultural landscapes as places for renewal"&lt;ref&gt;Lewis and Sheppard 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmology===
This   aspect  is a culturally based cosmology that is the foundation of the other aspects. The combination relates to the assumptions and beliefs about how things work, and explains the way in which things are connected, and gives principles that regulate human-animal relations and the role of humans in the world. From an anthropological perspective, cosmology attempts to understand the human-animal relationship and how these directly influence social relationships, obligations toward community members, and management practices.

==Ecosystem management theory==
{{Main|Ecosystem management}}

Ecosystem management is a multifaceted and holistic approach to natural resource management. It incorporates both  science and traditional ecological knowledge to collect data from long term measures that science cannot. This is achieved by scientists and researchers collaborating with Indigenous peoples through a consensus decision-making process while meeting the socioeconomic, political and cultural needs of current and future generations.

==Traditional knowledge and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency==
{{POV section|date=April 2017}}

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was one of the first federal agencies to develop formal policies detailing how it would collaborate with tribal governments and acknowledge tribal interests in enacting its programs "to protect human health and the environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/tribal/epa-policy-administration-environmental-programs-indian-reservations-1984-indian-policy|title=EPA Policy for the Administration of Environmental Programs on Indian Reservations (1984 Indian Policy)|last=EPA, OITA, AIEO|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognizing tribal peoples connection to the environment the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] has sought to develop environmental programs that integrate traditional ecological knowledge into the "agency's environmental science, policy, and decision-making processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://semspub.epa.gov/work/HQ/500024668.pdf|title=Consideration of Tribal Treaty Rights and Traditional Ecological Knowledge|last=Woolford|first=James|date=January 17, 2017|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although TEK is not currently recognized as an important component of mainstream environmental decision making, scientists are working on developing core science competency programs that align with TEK and promote self-sufficiency and determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.epa.gov/region9/tribal/web/pdf/tribal-ecological-knowledge-env-sci-policy-dm.pdf|title=Integration of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) in Environmental Science, Policy and Decision-Making|last=|first=|date=June 2011|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2000, U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] issued Executive Order 13175, which required federal departments and agencies to consult with Indian Tribal governments in the development of policies that would have Tribal implications.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/nativeamerican/pdf/tek-j-sepez.pdf|title=Traditional Environmental Knowledge in Federal Natural Resource Management Agencies|last=Sepez|first=Jennifer|last2=Lazrus|first2=Heather|date=Winter 2005|website=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tribal Implications are defined by the EPA as having "substantial direct effects on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the federal government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the federal government and Indian tribes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-executive-order-13175-consultation-and-coordination-indian-tribal|title=Summary of Executive Order 13175 - Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments|last=EPA, OA, OP, ORPM, RMD|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a Federal agency of the U.S. government, the EPA was required to establish a set of standards for the consultation process. As its initial response, the agency developed a set of standards that would allow for meaningful communication and coordination between the agency and tribal officials prior to the agency taking actions or implementing decisions that may affect tribes. The standards also designated EPA consultation contacts to promote consistency and coordination of the consultation process, and established management oversight and reporting to ensure accountability and transparency.

One form of consultation has been EPA Tribal Councils. In 2000, the EPA's Office of Research and Development formed the EPA Tribal Science Council. The council, made up of representatives from tribes across the nation, is meant to provide a structure for tribal involvement in EPA's science efforts, and serve as a vehicle through which EPA may gain an understanding of the scientific issues that are of highest priority to tribes at a national level. The Council also offers tribes an opportunity to influence EPA’s scientific agenda by raising these priority issues to an EPA-wide group.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-02/documents/ej-indigenous-policy.pdf|title=Policy on Environmental Justice for Working with Federally Recognized Tribes and Indigenous Peoples|last=|first=|date=July 24, 2014|website=www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of importance for tribal members at the initial gathering of the EPA Tribal Science Council was the inherent differences in tribal traditional lifeways and western science. These lifeways include "spiritual, emotional, physical, and mental connections to the environment; connections which are based on intrinsic, immeasurable values"; and an understanding that the earth’s resources will provide everything necessary for human survival.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The EPA's Tribal Science Council, however, was meant to act as a meeting place where both groups could "share information that may contribute to environmental protection for all peoples with neither culture relinquishing its identity." In an effort to protect TTL the Council identified subsitence as a critical area for investigation. The EPA-Tribal Science Council defined subsistence as: the "relationships between people and their surrounding environment, a way of living. Subsistence involves an intrinsic spiritual connection to the earth, and includes an understanding that the earth’s resources will provide everything necessary for human survival. People who subsist from the earth’s basic resources remain connected to those resources, living within the circle of life. Subsistence is about living in a way that will ensure the integrity of the earth’s resources for the beneficial use of generations to come." Because TTL or TEK is specific to a location and includes the relationships between plants and animals, and the relationship of living beings to the environment, acknowledgment of subsitence as a priority allows for the knowledge and practices of TTL to be protected. For example, as part of their deliberation regarding subsistence, the Council agreed to identify resource contamination as “the most critical tribal science issue at this time.” Because tribal people with subsistence lifestyles rely the environment for traditional techniques of farming, hunting. fishing, forestry, and medicines, and ceremonies, contaminants  disproportionately impact tribal peoples and jeopardizes their TTL. As the EPA Council stated, "Tribal subsistence consumption rates are typically many times higher than those of the general population, making the direct impact of resource contamination a much more immediate concern."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; As native peoples struggle with tainted resources, the Council has made progress in investigating its impacts.

Despite such efforts, there are still barriers to progress within the EPA-Tribal Science Council. For example, one obstacle has been the nature of TTL. Tribal Traditional Lifeways are passed down orally, from person to person, generation to generation, whereas western science relies on the written word, communicated through academic and literate transmission.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Endeavors to bring together western scientists and tribal people have also been hindered by Native American's perceptions that scientific analysis are put in a metaphorical “black box” that shuts out tribal input. Regardless, the EPA has recognized the ability of indigenous knowledge to advance scientific understanding and provide new information and perspectives that may benefit the environment and human health.

The integration of TTL into the EPA's risk assessment paradigm is one example of how the EPA-Tribal Science Council has been able to enact change in EPA culture. The risk assessment paradigm is an "organizing framework for the scientific analysis of the potential for harmful impacts to human health and the environment as a result of exposure to contaminants or other environmental stressors." Risk assessment has been used by the EPA to establish "clean-up levels at hazardous waste sites, water quality and air quality criteria, fish advisories, and bans or restricted uses for pesticides and other toxic chemicals."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.epa.gov/region9/tribal/web/pdf/tribal-ecological-knowledge-env-sci-policy-dm.pdf|title=Integration of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) in Environmental Science, Policy and Decision-Making|last=|first=|date=June 2011|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tribal people are concerned, however, that current risk assessment methodologies do not afford complete value to tribal culture, values, and/or life ways. The Tribal Science Council seeks to incorporate TTL into exposure assumptions existent in the EPA risk assessment model. A long-term goal for the  EPA’s Tribal Science Council, however, is a complete shift in decision-making assessments from risk to preserving a healthy people and environment. As stated above, tribal people do not accept a separation of the human and ecological condition when they characterize risk. Through EPA initiated seminar, workshops, and projects, tribes have been able to engage in dialogue about the integration of Tribal Traditional Lifeways into EPA risk assessment and decision-making. This has occurred in a number of ways: inclusion of unique tribal cultural activities such as native basketry, the importance of salmon and other fishes, native plant medicine, consumption of large amounts of fish and game, and sweat lodges as exposures for estimating potential risk to people or to communities. Although these types of tribal specific activities may be included in EPA's risk assessment, there is no assurance that they will be included nor is there consistency in how they may be applied at different sites across the country.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In July 2014, the EPA announced its “Policy on Environmental Justice for Working with Federally Recognized Tribes and Indigenous Peoples," setting forth its principles for programs related to [[federally recognized tribes]] and indigenous peoples in order to "support the fair and effective implementation of federal environmental laws, and provide protection from disproportionate impacts and significant risks to human health and the environment."&lt;ref name="Policy"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.epa.gov/partners/web/pdf/ej-indigenous-policy.pdf|title= EPA Policy on Environmental Justice for Working with Federally Recognized Tribes and Indigenous Peoples|last=|first=|date=July 24, 2014|website=|access-date=}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the 17 principles were #3 ("The EPA works to understand definitions of human health and the environment from the perspective of federally recognized tribes, indigenous peoples throughout the United States, and others living in Indian country"); #6 ("The EPA encourages, as appropriate and to the extent practicable and permitted by law, the integration of traditional ecological knowledge into the agency’s environmental science, policy, and decision-making processes, to understand and address environmental justice concerns and facilitate program implementation"); and #7 ("The EPA considers confidentiality concerns regarding information on sacred sites, cultural resources, and other traditional knowledge, as permitted by law.").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-02/documents/ej-indigenous-policy.pdf|title=EPA Policy on Environmental Justice for Working with Federally Recognized Tribes and Indigenous Peoples|last=McCarthy|first=Gina|date=|website=|access-date=}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this policy identifies guidelines and procedures for the EPA in regards to environmental justice principles as they relate to tribes and indigenous peoples, the agency noted that they are in no way applicable as [[United States administrative law#Rulemaking|rules or regulations]]. They cannot be applied to particular situations nor change or substitute any law, regulation, or any other legally-binding requirement and is not legally enforceable.&lt;ref name="Policy"/&gt;

==Effects on environmental degradation on traditional knowledge==
In some areas, [[environmental degradation]] has led to a decline in traditional ecological knowledge. For example, at the [[Aamjiwnaang First Nation|Aamjiwnaang]] community of [[Anishnaabe]] First Nations people in [[Sarnia, Ontario]], Canada, residents suffer from a "noticeable decrease in [[Human sex ratio|male birth ratio]] ..., which residents attribute to their proximity to petrochemical plants":&lt;ref name="Hoover"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoover|first=Elizabeth|year=2012|title=Indigenous Peoples of North America: Environmental Exposures and Reproductive Justice|jstor=23323091|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=120|pages=1645–1649|doi=10.1289/ehp.1205422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In addition to concerns about the physical reproduction of community members, indigenous people are concerned about how environmental contamination impacts the reproduction of cultural knowledge. In Aamjiwnaang, oral traditions once passed down from grandfathers during fishing or grandmothers during berry picking and medicine gathering are being lost as those activities are no longer practiced because of concerns about these foods being contaminated. Rocks once used for sweat lodges are no longer being collected from local streams because the streams have become contaminated. The cedar used for making tea, smudging, and washing babies contains vanadium at concentrations as high as 6 mg/kg..., reflecting local releases to air of &gt; 611 tons of vanadium between 2001 and 2010.... At Akwesasne, community members report a loss of language and culture around subsistence activities like fishing, which have been largely abandoned because of fears of exposure to contaminants.&lt;ref name="Hoover"/&gt;}}

==Climate change==
[[File:Indigenous people and Climate Change.pdf|thumb|upright|Indigenous people and Climate Change: fact sheet about the health impacts of climate change on indigenous populations.]]

Traditional ecological knowledge provides information about climate change across generations and geography of the actual residents in the area.&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ignatowski|first1=Jonathan Andrew|last2=Rosales|first2=Jon|title=Identifying the exposure of two subsistence villages in Alaska to climate change using traditional ecological knowledge|journal=Climatic Change|volume=121|issue=2|pages=285–299|doi=10.1007/s10584-013-0883-4|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-013-0883-4|accessdate=5 April 2017|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional ecological knowledge emphasizes and makes the information about the health and interactions of the environment the center of the information it carries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moffa|first1=Anthony|title=Traditional Ecological Rulemaking|url=https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moffa.pdf|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Climate change]] affects traditional ecological knowledge in the forms of the indigenous people’s identity and the way they live their lives.

The rising temperature poses as threats for ecosystems because it harms the livelihoods of certain tree and plant species. The combination of the rise in temperatures and change in precipitation levels affects plant growth locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change Threats and Solutions|url=https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/urgentissues/global-warming-climate-change/threats-solutions/|website=The Nature Conservancy|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change has wiped out much of the salmonids and acorns which make up a significant portion of the Karuk people's food. The increase in temperatures has stunted the wild rice's ability to grow and that has a negative influence on the Anishinaabe people's lifestyle.&lt;ref name="nca2014.globalchange.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Indigenous Peoples, Lands, and Resources|url=http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/sectors/indigenous-peoples#|website=Global Change|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ojibwe people are also affected by the rising temperature's effect on rice growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change and the Health of Indigenous Populations|url=https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts/health/factsheets/indigenous-health-climate-change.pdf|website=EPA United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=5 April 2017|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The warming also affects insects and animals. The change in temperatures can affect many aspects from the times that insects emerge throughout the year to the changes in the habitats of animals throughout seasonal changes. In Maine, the loss of certain habitats and the increase in temperatures, especially in the colder seasons, encourages the survival of ticks that harm the moose population.&lt;ref name="nca2014.globalchange.gov"/&gt;

As the temperature gets hotter, wild fires become more likely. Not only are different aspects of the environment are affected, but together, the health of the ecosystem is affected by climate change and so the environmental resources available to the indigenous people can change in the amount available and the quality of the resources.&lt;ref name="nca2014.globalchange.gov"/&gt;

The [[Navajo Nation]] peoples in the Southwestern United States are victims to the pollution in the air. Climate change increases chances for droughts which lead to the dangers of airborne dust to be picked up from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change and the Health of Indigenous Populations|url=https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts/health/factsheets/indigenous-health-climate-change.pdf|website=EPA United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=5 April 2017|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

	Water resources are also affected. In particular, about a third of the Navajo Nation people need to physically attain their own water. Damage to their water resources poses as dangers to overall health and crop failures. In Arizona, the Fort Apache reservation's children are victims to the rising temperatures in their water which allows more impurities to grow in the water and causes them to have diarrhea and stomach problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change and the Health of Indigenous Populations|url=https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts/health/factsheets/indigenous-health-climate-change.pdf|website=EPA United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=5 April 2017|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As sea ice levels decrease, Alaska Native peoples experience changes in their daily lives; fishing, transportation, social and economic aspects of their lives become more unsafe. The Native peoples residing on the Gulf and West Coasts are affected by the rising sea temperatures because that makes the fish and shellfish, that they rely on for food and cultural activities, more susceptible to contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change and the Health of Indigenous Populations|url=https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts/health/factsheets/indigenous-health-climate-change.pdf|website=EPA United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=5 April 2017|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defrosting of soil has caused damages to buildings and roadways. Water contamination becomes exacerbated as clean water resources dwindle.&lt;ref name="nca2014.globalchange.gov"/&gt;

Climate changes undermine the daily lives of the Native peoples on many levels. For example, to immediately deal with these conditions, the indigenous people adjust when they harvest and what they harvest and also adjust their resource use. Climate change can change the accuracy of the information of traditional ecological knowledge. The indigenous people have relied deeply on indicators in nature to plan activities and even for short- term weather predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vinyeta|first1=Kirsten|last2=Lynn|first2=Kathy|title=Exploring the role of traditional ecological knowledge in climate change initiative|url=https://permanent.access.gpo.gov/gpo37896/pnw_gtr879.pdf|publisher=Portland, OR: U. S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of even more increasing unfavorable conditions, the indigenous people relocate to find other ways to survive. As a result, there is a loss of cultural ties to the lands they once resided on and there is also a loss to the traditional ecological knowledge they had with the land there.&lt;ref name="nca2014.globalchange.gov"/&gt; Climate change adaptations not properly structured or implemented can harm the indigenous people's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raygorodetsky|first1=Gleb|title=Why Traditional Ecological Knowledge Holds the Key to Climate Change|url=https://unu.edu./publications/articles/why-traditional-knowledge-holds-the-key-to-climate-change.html|website=United Nations University|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA has mentioned that it would take traditional ecological knowledge into consideration in planning adaptations to climate change. The [[National Resource Conservation Service]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] has used methods of the indigenous people to combat climate change conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moffa|first1=Anthony|title=Traditional Ecological Rulemaking|url=https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moffa.pdf|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case Study: Savoonga and Shaktoolik, Alaska===

In one study, villagers of Savoonga and Shaktoolik, Alaska reported that over the last twenty years of their lives, the weather has become more difficult to predict, the colder season has shortened, there is more difficulty in predicting the amount of plants available for harvests, there are differences in animal migrations, there are more sightings of new species than before, and the activities of hunting and gathering have become not as predictable nor occur as often due to more limited availability to do so. The residents saw a noticeable change in their climate which also affected their livelihoods. The plants and animals are not as consistent with their availability which affects the residents' hunting and gathering because there is not as much to hunt or gather. The appearance of new species of plants and animals is also a physical and nutritional safety concern because they are not traditionally part of the land.&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7751">The '''Department of Applied Science at the University of California, Davis''' was a cooperative academic program involving the [[University of California, Davis]] and the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL). It was established in the fall of 1963 by [[Edward Teller]], director of LLNL,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Controversial champion for defense, nuclear research Edward Teller dies|publisher=UC Davis Dateline|date=September 19, 2003|url=http://www-dateline.ucdavis.edu/dl_detail.lasso?id=6668|accessdate=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Roy Bainer, then dean of the [[UC Davis College of Engineering]].&lt;ref name="Bookless1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=William A. Bookless|title=State of the Laboratory: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H4cwNm0GgoYC&amp;pg=PA85|accessdate=11 January 2013|date=November 1995|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-0-7881-2614-7|pages=85–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department was discontinued in 2011.&lt;ref name = "closed" /&gt;

==History==
Teller's push for an educational institution associated with the LLNL was part of a general movement championed by [[Alvin M. Weinberg]] of [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] to use the [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories]] to educate scientists, since at the time the department employed roughly 10% of the scientists in the United States.&lt;ref name=westwick/&gt;  Teller first approached the [[University of California, Berkeley]] with his idea,&lt;ref name=state/&gt; but the faculty there opposed the idea because of the military focus of the program and the administration wasn't receptive. So he turned, reluctantly,&lt;ref name=memoir&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edward Teller|author2=Judith L. Shoolery|title=Memoirs: A Twentieth Century Journey in Science and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n82xMo-BI8QC&amp;pg=PA479|accessdate=11 January 2013|date=16 October 2002|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-7867-5170-9|pages=479–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; to UC Davis instead.  There Bainer and [[Emil M. Mrak]], then [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of UCD, were more receptive to Teller's plan,&lt;ref name=kerr&gt;{{cite book|author=Clark Kerr|title=The Gold and the Blue: A Personal Memoir of the University of California, 1949-1967|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMEZ_47vXkAC&amp;pg=PA304|accessdate=11 January 2013|date=1 September 2001|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-22367-7|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some faculty of the College of Engineering were unhappy with the idea of outsiders teaching their students.&lt;ref name=memoir/&gt;

The lab at first shared the facilities at Lawrence Livermore, although the students conducted non-classified research.&lt;ref name=westwick&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter J. Westwick|title=The National Labs: Science in an American System, 1947-1974|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rpXQtHWGghcC&amp;pg=PA191|accessdate=10 January 2013|year=2003|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-00948-6|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teller intended the DAS to educate advanced students in nuclear physics and other subjects applicable to defense industries.&lt;ref name=teller/&gt;  The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], which administered LLNL,  was worried about allowing DAS to use its facilities if foreign students would be enrolled.  To meet this objection Teller agreed to limit the number of foreign students attending and to require prospective students to undergo [[FBI]] background checks.&lt;ref name=westwick/&gt;

Teller, who had been director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory beginning in 1958, was named the first chairman of the Department of Applied Science.&lt;ref name=state&gt;{{cite book|author=Istvan Hargittai|title=Judging Edward Teller: A Closer Look at One of the Most Influential Scientists of the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XlkmmIHiS9UC&amp;pg=PT273|accessdate=11 January 2013|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-61614-269-8|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its main location, built in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;p_product=AWNB&amp;p_text_direct-0=document_id=%28%2013D8CA13EFC95A48%20%29&amp;p_docid=13D8CA13EFC95A48&amp;p_theme=aggdocs&amp;p_queryname=13D8CA13EFC95A48&amp;f_openurl=yes&amp;p_nbid=F60E56PUMTM1NzkxNjk1NS4yNzE3NDk6MToxMzoxOTIuMTYwLjIxNi4w&amp;&amp;p_multi=DVEB|publisher=Davis Enterprise|author=Derrick Bang|date=March 15, 2012|title=UCD College of Engineering celebrates 50 years|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was on the grounds of the LLNL in a building paid for with a matching grant of $1,000,000 from the [[Hertz Foundation]] and thus called Hertz Hall.&lt;ref name="Broad1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=William J Broad|title=Star Warriors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CMmCmxmWSJYC&amp;pg=PA40|accessdate=11 January 2013|date=15 October 1986|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-671-62820-8|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Applied Science later became more centered at the UC Davis campus.  Many of the department's faculty had joint appointments with LLNL or other national laboratories, so that students in the department had access to facilities in both locations.

The UC Davis College of Engineering closed the Department of Applied Science in July 2011 for budgetary reasons after 48 years of operation.&lt;ref name = "closed"&gt;{{cite news|title=UCD department shuttered as more budget cuts loom|url=http://www.davisenterprise.com/local-news/ucd/ucd-department-shuttered-as-more-budget-cuts-loom/|publisher=Davis Enterprise|date=July 2, 2011|author=Cory Golden|accessdate=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
