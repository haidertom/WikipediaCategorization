'''''Aguirre, the Wrath of God''''' ({{lang-de|Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes}}), known in the UK as '''''Aguirre, Wrath of God''''', is a 1972 [[West Germany|West German]] [[Epic film|epic]] [[Historical period drama|historical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Werner Herzog]]. [[Klaus Kinski]] stars in the title role. The [[soundtrack]] was composed and performed by West German [[progressive rock|progressive]]/[[Krautrock]] band [[Popol Vuh (German band)|Popol Vuh]]. The story follows the travels of Spanish soldier [[Lope de Aguirre]], who leads a group of [[conquistador]]es down the [[Orinoco]] and [[Amazon River]] in South America in search of the legendary city of gold, [[El Dorado (legend)|El Dorado]].

Using a [[minimalism|minimalist]] approach to the story and dialogue, the film creates a vision of madness and folly, counterpointed by the lush but unforgiving Amazonian jungle. Although loosely based on what is known of the historical figure of Aguirre, Herzog acknowledged years after the film's release that its storyline is a work of fiction. Some of the people and situations may have been inspired by [[Gaspar de Carvajal]]'s account of an earlier Amazonian expedition, although Carvajal was not on the historical voyage represented in the film. Other accounts state that the expedition went into the jungles but never returned to civilization.

''Aguirre'' was the first of five collaborations between Herzog and the volatile Kinski. The director and the actor had differing views as to how the role should be played, and they clashed throughout filming; Kinski's tantrums terrorized both the crew and the local natives who were assisting the production. Shooting was entirely on location, and was fraught with difficulties. Filming took place in the [[Peru]]vian [[rainforest]] on the Amazon River during an arduous five-week period, shooting on [[tributary|tributaries]] of the [[Ucayali region]]. The cast and crew climbed mountains, cut through heavy vines to open routes to the various jungle locations, and rode treacherous river rapids on rafts built by natives.

''Aguirre'' opened to widespread critical acclaim, and quickly developed a large international [[cult film]] following. It was given an extensive [[art film|arthouse]] theatrical release in the United States in 1977, and remains one of the [[film director|director's]] best-known films. Several critics have declared the film a masterpiece, and it has appeared on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's list of "All Time 100 Best Films".  ''Aguirre'''s visual style and narrative elements had a strong influence on [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s 1979 film ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geraldpeary.com/interviews/abc/coppola.html | last=Peary | first=Gerald | title=Francis Ford Coppola, Interview with Gerald Peary | publisher=Gerald Peary | accessdate=March 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 1560, several score of [[Spaniards|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s, and a hundred [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] slaves, march down from the newly conquered [[Inca Empire]] in the [[Andes]] mountains into the jungles to the east, in search of the fabled country of El Dorado. Under the command of [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] (Alejandro Repullés), the men, clad in half [[personal armor|armor]], pull cannons down narrow mountainous paths and through dense, muddy jungle. On [[New Year's Eve]], reaching the end of his supplies and unable to go on without more information, Pizarro orders a group of forty men to scout ahead by raft down river. If they do not return to the main party within one week with news of what lies beyond, they will be considered lost. Pizarro chooses Don [[Pedro de Ursúa]] ([[Ruy Guerra]]) as the commander of the expedition, Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) as his [[second-in-command]], fat nobleman Don Fernando de Guzmán ([[Peter Berling]]) representing [[Spanish Royal Family|The Royal House of Spain]] and Brother Gaspar de Carvajal ([[Del Negro (actor)|Del Negro]]) to bring the word of God. Also accompanying the expedition, against Pizarro's better judgment, are Ursúa's mistress, Doña Inés ([[Helena Rojo]]) and Aguirre's teenage daughter, Florés (Cecilia Rivera, in her only film role).

Traveling through rapids, one of the four rafts gets caught in an [[Whitewater#Eddies|eddy]], and the others are unable to help free it. That night, gunfire erupts on the trapped raft; in the morning the men on board are found dead, with two missing. Ursúa wants the bodies to be brought back to camp for proper burial. Knowing this would slow down the expedition, Aguirre hints to Perucho (Daniel Ades) to "keep the rust off the cannon". Perucho proceeds to fire the cannon at the raft, destroying it and throwing the bodies into the river.

During the night, the remaining rafts are swept away by the rising river. Time has run out for the scouting mission, and Ursúa decides to return to Pizarro's group. Aguirre leads a [[mutiny]] against Ursúa, telling the men that untold riches await them ahead, and reminding them that [[Hernan Cortez]] won an empire in [[Mexico]] by disobeying orders. Ursúa attempts to put Aguirre in chains, but he and a soldier loyal to him are shot. Inés cares for Ursúa. Aguirre coerces the soldiers to elect the fat, lazy Don de Guzmán as the new leader of the expedition. Aguirre proclaims de Guzmán emperor of the new country and declares [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] dethroned. A farcical trial of Ursúa results in his being sentenced to death, but de Guzmán surprises Aguirre by granting Ursúa clemency.

Aguirre proves to be an oppressive leader, so terrifying that few protest his leadership. Only Inés has the courage to speak out against him. Knowing that some of the soldiers are still loyal to Ursúa, Aguirre simply ignores her.

The expedition continues on a single, newly built, large raft. An Indian couple approaching peacefully by canoe are captured by the explorers, and when the man expresses confusion when presented with a Bible, Brother Carvajal kills them for [[blasphemy]]. De Guzmán dines on the low food supplies while the men starve, and has the expedition's only remaining horse pushed off the raft because it annoys him. Soon afterwards he is found strangled near the raft's [[outhouse]]. After de Guzmán's death, Aguirre proclaims himself leader. Ursúa is then taken ashore and hanged in the jungle. The group attacks an Indian village, where several soldiers are killed by spears and arrows. The distraught Inés walks into the jungle and disappears.

On the raft again, the group of slowly starving, feverish men begin disbelieving everything they see, even when shot with arrows. The group stares in disbelief at a [[sailing ship|wooden ship]] perched in the highest branches of a tall tree, which Aguirre orders be brought down and refurbished, but Brother Carvajal refuses. In a series of final attacks by unseen assailants, the remaining survivors including Aguirre's daughter are killed by arrows. Aguirre alone remains alive on the slowly drifting raft. The raft becomes overrun by monkeys. The crazed Aguirre tells them: "I, the Wrath of God, will marry my own daughter, and with her I will found the purest dynasty the world has ever seen. Together, we shall rule this entire continent. We shall endure. I am the Wrath of God... who else is with me?" The final shot is of him waiting for the monkeys to respond.

==Production==
The idea for the film began when Herzog borrowed a book on historical adventurers from a friend. After reading a half-page devoted to Lope de Aguirre, the filmmaker became inspired and immediately devised the story. He fabricated most of the plot details and characters, although he did use some historical figures in purely fictitious ways.&lt;ref name="Herzog"&gt;Herzog, Werner. ''Aguirre, the Wrath of God'' [[DVD]], [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]], 2001, [[audio commentary]]. {{OCLC|228418112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Screenplay===
Herzog wrote the screenplay "in a frenzy", and completed it in two-and-a-half days. Much of the script was written during a {{convert|200|mi|km|adj=on}} bus trip with Herzog's football team. His teammates got drunk after winning a game and one of them vomited on several pages of Herzog's manuscript, which he immediately threw out the window. Herzog claims he cannot remember all of the things that he wrote on these pages.&lt;ref name="Herzog" /&gt;

The screenplay was shot as written, with some minor differences. In an early scene in which Pizarro instructs Ursúa to lead the scouting team down the river, in the script Pizarro mentions that in the course of the expedition Ursúa could possibly discover what happened to [[Francisco de Orellana]]'s expedition, which had vanished without a trace years before (see "Historical Accuracy" section). Later in the screenplay, Aguirre and his men find a boat and the long-dead remains of Orellana's soldiers. Further down the river, they discover another ship lodged in some tree tops. In the screenplay, Aguirre and others explore the boat but find no sign of Orellana or his men. Herzog ultimately eliminated any such references to Orellana's expedition from the film. The sequence with the boat caught in the upper branches of a tree remains, but as filmed it seems to be simply a hallucinatory vision.&lt;ref name="Fritze"&gt;Fritze, Ronald. "Werner Herzog's Adaptation of History in Aguirre, The Wrath of God", from ''Film and History'', Issue 15:4, pgs. 74-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The finale is significantly different from Herzog's original script. The director recalled, "I only remember that the end of the film was totally different. The end was actually the raft going out into the open ocean and being swept back inland, because for many miles you have a counter-current, the Amazon actually goes backwards. And it was tossed to and fro. And a parrot would scream: "El Dorado, El Dorado"..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horschamp.qc.ca/new_offscreen/werner_herzog.html|title=The Trail of Werner Herzog:  An Interview|accessdate=2007-05-08|first=Werner|last=Herzog|publisher=Off Screen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herzog and Kinski===
Herzog's first choice for the role of Aguirre was actor Klaus Kinski. The two had met many years earlier when the then-struggling young actor rented a room in Herzog's family apartment, and Kinski's often terrifying and deranged antics during the three months he lived there left a lasting impression on the director. Years later, Herzog remembered the volatile actor and knew that he was the only possible man who could play the mad Aguirre, and he sent Kinski a copy of the screenplay. "Between three and four in the morning, the phone rang", Herzog recalled. "It took me at least a couple of minutes before I realized that it was Kinski who was the source of this inarticulate screaming. And after an hour of this, it dawned on me that he found it the most fascinating screenplay and wanted to be Aguirre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,676082,00.html|title=The Enigma of Werner H|accessdate=&lt;!----2007-08-22----&gt;|date=20 March 2002|first=John|last=O'Mahony|work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of the production, Herzog and Kinski argued about the proper manner to portray Aguirre. Kinski wanted to play a "wild, ranting madman", but Herzog wanted something "quieter, more menacing". In order to get the performance he desired, before each shot Herzog would deliberately infuriate Kinski. After waiting for the hot-tempered actor's anger to "burn itself out", Herzog would then roll the camera.&lt;ref name="Knipfel"&gt;[[Jim Knipfel|Knipfel, Jim]]. ''Aguirre, the Wrath of God'' DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2001, [[liner notes]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On one occasion, irritated by the noise from a hut where cast and crew were playing cards, the explosive Kinski fired three [[gunshots]] at it, blowing the tip off one extra's finger.&lt;ref name="Herzog" /&gt; Subsequently, Kinski started leaving the jungle location (over Herzog's refusal to fire a sound assistant), only changing his mind after Herzog threatened to shoot first Kinski and then himself. The latter incident has given rise to the legend that Herzog made Kinski act for him at gunpoint. However, Herzog has repeatedly denied the claim during interviews, saying he only verbally threatened Kinski in the heat of the moment, in a desperate attempt to keep him from leaving the set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://weeklywire.com/ww/04-27-98/slc_ae.html |date=April 27, 1998|title=Hauntingly Herzog |accessdate=&lt;!----2007-05-08----&gt; |first=Mary|last=Dickson |work=City Weekly |location=Salt Lake City}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident is parodied in ''[[Incident at Loch Ness]]'', which Herzog co-wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=March 21, 2009|url=http://moria.co.nz/sciencefiction/incidentatlochness.htm|title=Incident at Loch Ness|accessdate=September 7, 2009|first=Richard|last=Scheib|work=Moria, The Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Film Review|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312051754/http://moria.co.nz/sciencefiction/incidentatlochness.htm|archivedate=12 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
The film was made for [[United States dollar|US$]]370,000, with one-third of the budget paying for Kinski's salary.&lt;ref name="Herzog1"&gt;Herzog, Werner. ''Herzog on Herzog'', edited by Paul Cronin, Faber &amp; Faber, 2003. {{ISBN|0-571-20708-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was filmed on location in the [[Peru]]vian [[rainforest]], [[Machu Picchu]] (the stone steps of [[Huayna Picchu]]),&lt;ref name="Herzog1" /&gt; and on the [[Amazon River]] [[tributary|tributaries]] of the [[Ucayali region]]. ''Aguirre'' was shot in five weeks, following nine months' worth of pre-production planning.&lt;ref name="Herzog" /&gt; The film was shot in chronological order, because Herzog believed the film crew's progress on the river directly mirrored that of the explorers' journey in the story. The director and his cast and crew floated in rafts down the [[Huallaga River|Huallaga]] and [[Nanay]] rivers through the [[Urubamba Valley]] in Peru.&lt;ref name="Herzog1" /&gt;

All of the actors spoke their dialogue in English. The members of the cast and crew came from sixteen different countries, and English was the only common language among them. In addition, Herzog felt that shooting ''Aguirre'' in English would improve the film's chances for international distribution. However, the small amount of money that had been set aside for post-synchronization "left Peru with the man in charge of the process; both absconded ''en route''."  The English-language track was ultimately replaced by a higher-quality [[German language]] version, which was [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|post-synched]] after production was completed.&lt;ref name="Overbey" /&gt; Herzog claims that Kinski requested too much money for the dubbing session, and so his lines were performed by another actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050828/PEOPLE/50828001|title=A conversation with Werner Herzog|accessdate=19 June 2007 |first=Werner|last=Herzog|publisher=www.rogerebert.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[low budget]] precluded the use of stunt men or elaborate [[special effects]]. The cast and crew climbed up mountains, hacked through thick jungle, and rode ferocious Amazonian river rapids on rafts built by natives. At one point, a storm caused a river to flood, covering the film sets in several feet of water and destroying all the rafts built for the film. This flooding was immediately incorporated into the story, as a sequence including a flood and subsequent rebuilding of rafts was shot.&lt;ref name="Herzog" /&gt;

The camera used to shoot the film was stolen by Herzog from the Munich Film School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.harpers.org/archive/2006/12/0081313
| title=The Secret Mainstream: Contemplating the mirages of Werner Herzog|date = December 2006|accessdate=&lt;!----2007-05-08----&gt; |first=Tom|last=Bissell|work=[[Harper's Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Herzog recalled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was a very simple [[35mm]] camera, one I used on many other films, so I do not consider it a theft. For me, it was truly a necessity. I wanted to make films and needed a camera. I had some sort of natural right to this tool. If you need air to breathe, and you are locked in a room, you have to take a chisel and hammer and break down a wall. It is your absolute right.&lt;ref name="Herzog1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To obtain the monkeys used in the climactic sequence, Herzog paid several locals to trap 400 monkeys; he paid them half in advance and was to pay the other half upon receipt. The trappers sold the monkeys to someone in Los Angeles or Miami, and Herzog came to the airport just as the monkeys were being loaded to be shipped out of the country. He pretended to be a veterinarian and claimed that the monkeys needed vaccinations before leaving the country. Abashed, the handlers unloaded the monkeys, and Herzog loaded them into his jeep and drove away, used them in the shot they were required for, and released them afterwards into the jungle.&lt;ref name="Herzog" /&gt;

===Music===
{{main|Aguirre (soundtrack)}}
''Aguirre'''s [[film score|musical score]] was performed by [[Popol Vuh (German band)|Popol Vuh]], a West German [[progressive rock|progressive]]/[[Krautrock]] band. The band was formed in 1970 by keyboardist Florian Fricke, who had known Herzog for several years prior to the formation of the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurock.com/features/florian.aspx |title=Florian Fricke Interview|accessdate=2007-10-30|first=Gerhard|last=Augustin|publisher=Eurock| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071015223326/http://eurock.com/features/florian.aspx| archivedate= 15 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He had appeared as an actor in the director's first full-length film, ''[[Signs of Life (1968 film)|Signs of Life]]'' (1968), playing a pianist. ''Aguirre'' was only the first of many collaborations between the band and the director.

Popol Vuh's "hypnotic music"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/film_review.asp?ID=2561 |title=Aguirre: The Wrath of God |accessdate=2007-10-30 |first=Nick |last=Schager |publisher=Slant Magazine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213085318/http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/film_review.asp?ID=2561 |archivedate=13 December 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; for ''Aguirre'' met with considerable acclaim.  Roger Ebert wrote, "The music sets the tone. It is haunting, ecclesiastical, human and yet something else... [T]he music is crucial to ''Aguirre, the Wrath of God''..."&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990404/REVIEWS08/904040301/1023 |title=Aguirre, the Wrath of God (1972) |accessdate=2007-10-30 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011154923/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19990404%2FREVIEWS08%2F904040301%2F1023 |archivedate=11 October 2007 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AllMusic]] noted, "The film's central [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] blends pulsing [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]] and spectral voices conjured from Florian Fricke's Mellotron-related "choir organ" to achieve something sublime, in the truest sense of the word: it's hard not to find the music's awe-inspiring, overwhelming beauty simultaneously unsettling. The power of the legendary opening sequence of Herzog's film...owes as much to Popol Vuh's music as it does to the director's [[Mise en scène|mise-en-scène]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r108141|pure_url=yes}} |title=Aguirre Review|accessdate=2007-10-30|first=Neate|last=Wilson|publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herzog explained how the choir-like sound was created, "We used a strange instrument, which we called a '[[Mellotron|choir-organ]].' It has inside it three dozen different tapes running parallel to each other in loops. ... All these tapes are running at the same time, and there is a keyboard on which you can play them like an organ so that [it will] sound just like a human choir but yet, at the same time, very artificial and really quite eerie."&lt;ref name="Ebert" /&gt;

In 1975 Popol Vuh released an album entitled [[Aguirre (soundtrack)|''Aguirre'']]. Although ostensibly a [[soundtrack album]] to Herzog's film, the six-track [[LP album|LP]] included only two songs ("Aguirre I (L'Acrime Di Rei)" and "Aguirre II") taken from ''Aguirre, the Wrath of God''. The four remaining tracks were derived from various recordings made by the group between about 1972 and 1974. At the time of ''Aguirre'' the band members were Fricke ([[piano]], [[Mellotron]]), Fichelscher ([[electric guitar]], [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]], [[Drum kit|drums]]), Djong Yun ([[singing|vocals]]), and Robert Eliscu ([[oboe]], [[Pan flute|pan pipe]]).

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The film was produced in part by West German television station ''[[Hessischer Rundfunk]]'', which televised the film on the same day it opened in theatres. Herzog has blamed this for the relatively poor commercial reception of the film in Germany.&lt;ref name="Herzog1" /&gt; However, outside Germany the film became an "enormous [[cult film|cult]] favorite" in "such places as Mexico, Venezuela, and Algiers."&lt;ref name="Peary"&gt;[[Danny Peary|Peary, Danny]]. ''[[Cult Movies (book)|Cult Movies]]'', Delta Books, 1981. {{ISBN|0-517-20185-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had a theatrical run of fifteen months in Paris.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;Young, Vernon. "Much Madness: Werner Herzog and Contemporary German Cinema", in ''[[The Hudson Review]]'', Vol. 30, No. 3 (August 1977), pp. 409-414.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aguirre'' received a theatrical release in the United States in 1977 by [[New Yorker Films]]. It immediately became a cult film, and New Yorker Films reported four years after its initial release that it was the only film in its catalog that never went out of circulation.&lt;ref name="Peary"/&gt;

In Germany, the ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' described the film as "a colour-drenched, violently physical moving painting".&lt;ref name=Baumgardt&gt;{{cite web | author=Baumgardt, Carsten| year=| work=FilmStarts| url=http://www.filmstarts.de/kritiken/37028-Aguirre-Der-Zorn-Gottes.html|title=Aguirre - Der Zorn Gottes (German language)| accessdate = 2009-03-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090228195344/http://www.filmstarts.de/kritiken/37028-Aguirre-Der-Zorn-Gottes.html| archivedate= 28 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' described Kinski's acting as "too theatrical" to embody God's wrath.&lt;ref name="Baumgardt" /&gt;

In the US and the UK the film received mostly positive critical notices upon release. [[Vincent Canby]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', called it "[A]bsolutely stunning&amp;nbsp;... Mr. Herzog views all the proceedings with fixed detachment. He remains cool. He takes no sides. He may even be slightly amused. Mainly he is a poet who constantly surprises us with unexpected juxtapositions ... This is a splendid and haunting work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF1739E762BC4C53DFB266838C669EDE |title= 'Aguirre, the Wrath of God' Haunting Film by Herzog, |accessdate=&lt;!----2008-06-14----&gt; |first=Vincent|last=Canby|work = The New York Times | date=April 4, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', [[Richard Schickel]] opined that "[Herzog] does the audience the honor of allowing it to discover the blindnesses and obsessions, the sober lunacies he quietly lays out on the screen. Well acted, most notably by Klaus Kinski in the title role, gloriously photographed by Thomas Mauch, ''Aguirre'' is, not to put too fine a point on it, a movie that makes a convincing claim to greatness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date=May 16, 1977 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918983,00.html?internalid=atm100 |title=Meditation on Madness|accessdate=&lt;!----2007-03-14----&gt; |first=Richard|last=Schickel|work =Time |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time Out (company)|''Time Out's'']] [[Tony Rayns]] noted, "...each scene and each detail is honed down to its salient features. On this level, the film effectively pre-empts analysis by analysing itself as it proceeds, admitting no ambiguity. Yet at the same time, Herzog's flair for charged explosive imagery has never had freer rein, and the film is rich in [[oneiric (film theory)|oneiric moments]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/77613/aguirre-wrath-of-god.html|title=Aguirre, Wrath of God|accessdate=2007-03-14|first=Tony|last=Rayns|work =Time Out Film guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
The film's reputation through the years has continued to grow. [[J. Hoberman]] has written that ''Aguirre'' "is not just a great movie but an essential one ... Herzog's third feature ... is both a landmark film and a magnificent social metaphor."&lt;ref name="Hoberman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0642,hoberman,74738,20.html |location=New York |title=Jungle Fevers |accessdate=&lt;!----2007-03-14----&gt; |date=October 10, 2006 |first=J. |last=Hoberman |work=[[Village Voice]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306012142/http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0642%2Choberman%2C74738%2C20.html |archivedate=6 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Danny Peary]] wrote, "To see ''Aguirre'' for the first time is to discover a genuine masterpiece.

===Influence===
[[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s 1979 film ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', a film based on [[Joseph Conrad]]'s 1902 [[novella]] ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', was influenced also by ''Aguirre'', as it contains seemingly deliberate visual "quotations" of Herzog's film.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/webspaces/siskelfilmcenter/2007/february/2.html |last=Rubin |first=Martin |title=Werner Herzog: Visionary at Large |publisher=[[Gene Siskel]] Film Center |accessdate=2007-03-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224165959/http://www.artic.edu/webspaces/siskelfilmcenter/2007/february/2.html |archivedate=24 February 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=100264 |last=|first=|title=Aguirre, the Wrath of God|publisher=[[Channel 4]] Film|accessdate=2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidsterritt.com/coppola.html|last=Sterritt|first=David|title=Coppola, 'Apocalypse Now,' and the Ambivalent 70's|publisher=DavidSterritt.com|accessdate=2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coppola himself has noted, "''Aguirre'', with its incredible imagery, was a very strong influence. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Several critics have noted that ''Aguirre'' appears to have had a direct influence on several other films.  Martin Rubin has written that "[a]mong the films strongly influenced by ''Aguirre'' are Coppola's ''Apocalypse Now'' and [[Terrence Malick]]'s ''[[The New World (2005 film)|The New World]]'' (2005)".&lt;ref name="Rubin" /&gt;  J. Hoberman agreed, noting that Herzog's "[[sui generis]] Amazon fever dream" was "the influence Malick's over-inflated ''New World'' can't shake."&lt;ref name="Hoberman" /&gt; [[Channel 4]] opined "This is an astonishing, deceptively simple, pocket-sized epic whose influence, in terms of both style and narrative, is seen in films as diverse as ''Apocalypse Now'', ''[[The Mission (1986 film)|The Mission]]'', ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', and ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' (1999)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=100142|title=Aguirre The Wrath of God |accessdate=13 August 2007|publisher=www.channel4.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070806132003/http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=100142| archivedate= 6 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accuracy==
Although plot details and many of the characters in ''Aguirre'' come directly from Herzog's own imagination,  historians have pointed out that the film fairly accurately incorporates some 16th-century events and historical personages into a fictional narrative. 
Herzog's screenplay merged two different expeditions: one led by [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] in 1541, which resulted in the discovery of the [[Amazon river]] by [[Francisco de Orellana]], and another one that occurred in 1560.
The expedition of [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and his men left from the city of [[Quito]] and entered the Amazon basin in search of El Dorado. Various troubles afflicted the expedition and, sure that El Dorado was very close, Pizarro set up a smaller group led by [[Francisco de Orellana]] to break off from the main group and forge ahead, then return with news of what they had found. This group utilized a [[brigantine]] to journey down the river. 
After failing to find the legendary city, Orellana was unable to return because of the current, and he and his men continued to follow the [[Napo River]] until he reached the [[estuary]] of the Amazon in 1542.
Accompanying Orellana was [[Gaspar de Carvajal]], who kept a journal of the group's experiences.
The historic Gaspar de Carvajal (1500–1584) was a Spanish Dominican friar who had settled in Peru and dedicated himself to the conversion of the Indians. His general attitude towards the Indians was consistent with the benevolence of his better-known brother Dominican friar, Bartolomé de las Casas.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} This personality is at odds with the description in the film where Carvajal is portrayed as a cowardly priest who claimed that "the church was always on the side of the strong."{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} &lt;ref name="Fritze" /&gt;  
The film's major characters, Aguirre, Ursúa, Don Fernando, Inez and Florés, were involved in the second expedition, which left Peru in 1560 to find the city of El Dorado. Commissioned by Peru's governor, Ursúa organized an expeditionary group of 300 men to travel by way of the Amazon River. He was accompanied by his [[Mestizo|mixed-race]] mistress, Doña Inez. At one point during the journey, Aguirre, a professional soldier, decided that he could use the 300 men to overthrow the Spanish rule of Peru. Aguirre had Ursúa murdered and proclaimed Fernando as "The Prince of Peru". Fernando himself was eventually murdered when he questioned Aguirre's scheme of sailing to the Atlantic, conquering Panama, crossing the isthmus and invading Peru.  Many others who attempted to rebel against Aguirre were also killed. The surviving soldiers conquered [[Isla Margarita]] off the coast of [[Venezuela]] and made preparations to attack the mainland. However, by that time Spanish authorities had learned of Aguirre's plans, and when the rebels arrived in Venezuela, government agents offered full pardons to Aguirre's men. All of them accepted the deal. Immediately prior to his arrest, Aguirre murdered his daughter Florés, who had remained by his side during the entire journey. He was then captured and dismembered.&lt;ref name="Waller"&gt;Waller, Gregory. "Aguirre, The Wrath of God:  History, Theater, and the Camera", from ''[[South Atlantic Review]]'' 46.2 (1981), pgs. 55 – 69.&lt;/ref&gt;
Other Spanish expeditions outside the Amazon influenced the story; the conversation in which the Indians refuse a Bible comes from events before the [[Battle of Cajamarca]], in which Inca emperor [[Atahualpa]] allegedly rejected the [[Requerimiento]]. The chronicle of [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]], ''La Relación'' ("''The Account''"), mentions the appearance of a boat in a treetop after a fierce tropical storm in [[Hispaniola]]:

{{quote|Monday morning we went down to the port and did not find the ships. We saw their buoys in the water, from which we realized that they had been lost, and we went along the coast to see if we could find signs of them. Since we found nothing, we went into the woods, and a quarter of a league into them we found one of the ship's boats in some trees.|Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca.&lt;ref&gt;Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca 'The Account and Commentaries of Governor Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca'', [http://alkek.library.txstate.edu/swwc/cdv/book/7.html Chapter One]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Kinski's crazed performance bore similarities to the real Aguirre, a "true homicidal megalomaniac". Many of his fellow soldiers considered his actions to be that of a madman.&lt;ref name="Fritze" /&gt;  Kinski's use of a limp reflected one that Aguirre had, the result of a battle injury. Aguirre's frequent short but impassioned speeches to his men in the film were accurately based on the man's noted "simple but effective rhetorical ability."&lt;ref name="Waller"/&gt;

[[File:Collins St architecture.jpg|thumb|right|Skyscrapers along [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]] have been set back to preserve Victorian architecture from the 1800s.]]
[[File:Melbourne GPO early evening.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Melbourne General Post Office]] was constructed during the Victorian Gold Rush and now serves as a [[H&amp;M]] store.]]
The '''architecture of [[Melbourne]]''', the [[List of cities in Australia|second most populous city in Australia]], is characterised by an extensive juxtaposition of old and new [[architecture]]. The city is noted for preserving a significant amount of [[Victorian architecture]] and has some of the largest in the country. Additionally, it features a vast array of modern architecture, with around 60 skyscrapers over 100&amp;nbsp;m in the [[Melbourne city centre|city centre]] which have deliberately been set back from thoroughfares and streets to preserve historic architecture—leading to the title of "Australia's most European city".

Melbourne prospered significantly after the discovery of gold in the 1850s, which led to a [[Gold Rush]] that brought a prolonged period of wealth and granduer to the city&amp;ndash;for a period of time it was one of the wealthiest cities in the [[British Empire]], second only to London. This is reflected in much of the ornamentation of architecture and its flourishing Victorian era periods which led to some of the most prolific edifices in Australia's early history. For some time up until the early 20th century, it was Australia's most populous city until overtaken by [[Sydney]]. Melbourne is also said to have anticipated the skyscraper race alongside [[Chicago]] and New York City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Buildings in Melbourne: The Loftiest Structures in the City|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/6132483?searchTerm=new%20building%20loftiest&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=188||||accessdate=29 May 2017|publisher=The Argus|date=14 June 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the construction of the Queen Anne [[APA Building|APA (Australia) Building]], sometimes referred to as one of the world's tallest buildings in the 1890s, Australia's tallest building until 1912 and Melbourne's tallest building until 1929. Slipshod government and council attitudes towards heritage in the 1950s, 60s and 70s led to the destruction of most of the city's early architecture, although some edifices have been retained, specifically the [[Royal Exhibition Building]], the Melbourne [[Melbourne GPO|General Post Office]], the [[State Library of Victoria]] and a number of [[:Category:Churches in Melbourne|churches and cathedrals]].

Engineering developments led to Melbourne's status as a port city, and due to the location on the [[Yarra River]] and the inability to navigate it, ships had to be unloaded at [[Williamstown, Victoria|Williamstown]] (formerly Hobson's Bay) and [[Sandridge, Victoria|Sandridge]].  English engineer [[Sir John Coode]] oversaw the construction of Victoria Dock in swampland to the west of the city in 1889. The postwar period of Melbourne saw a regeneration of the city's economy and a successful bid to host the [[1956 Summer Olympics]]. Around this time, the construction of the skyscraper [[ICI House]] led to the city entering a contemporary style of high-rise architectural development similar to that of North America and Asia.

The juxtaposition of old and new has given Melbourne a reputation as a city of no characterising architectural style, but rather an accumulation of buildings dating from the present back until the [[European settlement of Australia]]. The city is also home to [[Eureka Tower]] (2006), which was the tallest residential tower when measured to its highest floor for some time.&lt;ref name=TallestRes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/List/tallest-residential-100-buildings |title=100 Tallest Residential Buildings in the World |work=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat |accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Melbourne}}
{{Further|Victorian gold rush}}
===Boom era (1840s–1890s)===
Melbourne was first settled in 1835, after the discovery of fresh water in the [[Yarra River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Founding of Melbourne, 1835|work=[[Museum of Victoria]]|accessdate=12 December 2017|url=https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/articles/6775}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land to the north of the Yarra was considerably flat, while low-lying mountain ranges lay to the west, east and north, with small streams running through the plains of the city, down to the Yarra. Melbourne was settled on the more desirable northern bank, and [[Hoddle Grid|Surveyor Hoddle's grid of streets]], approximately 30 metres wide (considerably wider than [[Sydney]] streets), followed the course of the Yarra.&lt;ref name="COM2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=53|title=City of Melbourne&amp;nbsp;— Roads&amp;nbsp;— Introduction|publisher=City of Melbourne|accessdate=29 September 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220130459/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=53|archivedate=20 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land was subsequently flattened, to allow railway development at Spencer Street. The town was largely developed by [[John Batman]] and [[John Pascoe Fawkner]], two Tasmanians who surveyed and purchased land in the 1830s. Until the 1850s, the settlement of Melbourne grew at a moderate but steady pace and its population increased. Following this early settlement period, [[gold]] was discovered and masses of people flocked to the city's port from Europe and the United States, in order to dig from the alluvial [[Gold mining|goldfields]] discovered across Victoria. As a result of the [[Gold Rush]], Melbourne's population grew from 4,000 in 1837 to 300,000 in 1854.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|2014|pp=7}} Approximately £100 million worth of gold was discovered in the Victorian fields in the 1850s.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|2014|pp=7}} During this time, those who immigrated to the city became caterers to the miners, as well as entrepreneurs establishing businesses across the city. Because of the accumulating wealth of Melbourne, many prominent buildings were established on public land allocated by Surveyor Hoddle. These included the [[State Library of Victoria|State Library]], [[Parliament House, Melbourne|Parliament House]], the [[Melbourne Town Hall|Town Hall]], and the [[Melbourne GPO|General Post Office]]. This prolonged time of prosperity and development in the city led to the moniker "Marvellous Melbourne".{{sfn|Davison}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A History of the City of Melbourne's Urban Environment|url=https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/SiteCollectionDocuments/history-city-of-melbourne-urban-environment.pdf|date=12 June 2012|accessdate=12 December 2017|work=[[Government of Victoria]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; London banks distributed large amounts of money to men who had visions for Melbourne, particularly in the form of grand, elaborate edifices. During this period, The Craig, Williamson and Thomas store (1883), the Prell's Buildings (1889), the Menzies Hotel (1867), the Fink's Building (1888), the [[Federal Coffee Palace]] (1883), the Broken Hill Chambers (1880), head office of [[Broken Hill Proprietary]] (BHP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2248991|title=Broken Hill Chambers, Queen St, Melbourne [picture] / J.W. Lindt|work=[[National Library of Australia]]|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Equitable / Colonial Mutual Life Building (1893)&amp;ndash;all have since been destroyed.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|2014|pp=7}}
[[File:APA Australia Building in Melbourne.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|The [[APA Building]], built in 1889, was one of the world's tallest buildings in the 1890s. It was demolished in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Property Investment Co. Building|work=National Trust Database|url=http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/search/nattrust_result_detail/71961|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The concept for the Prell's Building was devised when Friedrich Wilhelm Prell was commissioned to construct buildings in Melbourne. Prell was born in [[Hamburg, Germany]] and migrated to Australia at the age of 21.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=95}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/11671199|title=Death of Mr F. W. Prell|date=29 April 1929|work=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the firm of F.W. Prell and Company Limited, an import/export business. In 1886, the vice-president of the American [[Otis Elevator Company]], W.F. Hall, visited Melbourne. In conversation with Prell, Hall noticed that Sydney had six Otis elevator lifts in operation in public buildings, however Melbourne had none. He remarked that men who had to climb stairs in Melbourne's offices would do so with great difficulty, reaching the top floor with "aching legs, a fluttering heart, and a firm resolution to do business elsewhere".{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=95}} Prell added two more storeys to his building, as well as Victoria's first passenger elevators. Between 1888 and 1889, three 11-storey buildings were constructed in Queens and Collins Streets. The buildings, known as Prell's buildings, dominated the southern section of the city with their Modern Renaissance style, and were known as "Towers of Babel of the elevator type. The buildings were constructed in brick or stone with ornamented cornices. The building was generally used for commercial offices. The Prell's buildings were demolished in 1975, for "no sound reason".{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=95}}

The Craig, Williamson and Thomas buildings were department stores that sold goods including robes, silks and satins, until a fire broke out on 22 November 1897 and destroyed much of the building's interior, creating a damage bill of £1,500,000 and a stock los of £100,000.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=76}} The facade was preserved, and extended, before the building was sold in 1946, after ten years on the market. The [[Commonwealth Bank]] opened a branch at the site, before demolishing what had once been the largest retailer in Australia in 1969.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=76}} The Menzies Hotel, constructed in 1867 in [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire]] style, was host to prominent figures such as [[Alexander Graham Bell]], [[Herbert Hoover]] and [[Dame Nellie Melba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Menzies Hotel|work=Walking Melbourne|url=http://www.walkingmelbourne.com/building383_the-menzies-hotel.html|accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of Melbourne's first grand hotels and was built on land purchased by Archibald and Catherine Menzies.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=73}} Like the Craig, Williamson and Thomas building, it too was demolished in 1969 to make way for the BHP Plaza. The Colonial Mutual Life Building was built for the [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company|Equitable Life Assurance Society of America]], designed to be "the grandest building in the Southern Hemisphere and to last forever".{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=43}} Designed by Austrian-born American architect Edward Raht, who based the design on similar buildings in [[Chicago]] and New York City, the building cost was estimated at £233,000.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=43}} It was one of the taller buildings in Melbourne at the time, at 7 storeys and 132 feet.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=43}} It became the basis of height restrictions outlined in the Building act of 1916.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=43}} The [[National Trust]], who sided with public opinion that the building was "outdated, ostentatious and gloomy", deemed it ineligible for protection and it was subsequently destroyed in 1960.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=43}}
[[File:Federal Coffee Palace, Melbourne, Australia.jpg|thumb|right|upright|19th-century grand hotel the [[Federal Coffee Palace]], located on a Collins Street corner, was demolished in 1971.]]
The [[APA Building|Australian Building]], also known as the APA Building, was for some time one of the tallest buildings in the world.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=100}} Located on [[Elizabeth Street, Melbourne|Elizabeth Street]], on the corner of [[Flinders Lane]], the building dominated the Melbourne skyline for many years until the construction of [[ICI House|ICI Building]] in 1957. The building was constructed on the site of the E.S. &amp; A Bank and reached a total of 12-storeys (164 feet).{{sfn|Griffith|pp=76}} It was envisioned by F.T. Durham, Post Master General and director of the biscuit company Swallow and Ariell. The APA Building was constructed between 1888&amp;ndash;89 in the [[Queen Anne architecture|Queen Anne]] architectural style, with a gabled roofline, walkway, pinnacles and decorative masonry. It was built in red and cream horizontal bands, with shops and offices occupying most floors. Hydraulic lifts were added to the building and opened by the premier, [[Alfred Deakin]]. As the building neared completion, Melbourne's land boom was dissipating and the city entered an economic depression. Office space became considerably difficult to lease. Durham's assets were purchased greater than their market value by the Munro's Real Estate Bank, which helped secure his company. The top floor and pinnacles were removed in the 1950s. The building itself was demolished in 1981, supposedly because it was a "fire hazard", and the owners refused to pay the $2 million for fire insurance.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=100}}

The [[Federal Coffee Palace]], a [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire]] style building on Collins Street, was constructed in 1883. At the time of opening, an article in ''[[The Age]]'' declared it as one of "Australia's most splendid" buildings. It was commissioned by politicians and property developers James munro and James Mirams. The exterior was designed by Ellerker and Killburn, and the interior by William Pitt in a joint venture. At a cost of £150,000, the building became one of Melbourne's grand ornamented hotels. A preference for modern American hotels saw the death of old world establishments like the Federal Hotel and despite public outcry and petitions, it was demolished in the early 1970s.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=89}} A similar fate was met by other grand buildings of this era, including the smaller scale Melbourne Queen Victoria Hospital (1848&amp;ndash;1994), the 10-storey Fink's Building (1888&amp;ndash;1967), Scott's Hotel (1837&amp;ndash;1962), Victoria Building and Queens Walk Arcade (1888&amp;ndash;1960s), APA Tower (1880s&amp;ndash;1967), the Fish Markets (1892&amp;ndash;1959) and the Tivoli Opera House (1866&amp;ndash;1969).{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=144}}[[File:Royal Exhibition Building in Carlton Gardens.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Royal Exhibition Building]] (1879), a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/10/20/1034561388451.html "Global status for our greatest building"], 21 October 2002.

Although never reaching the height of the APA Building, several other buildings dominated Melbourne's skyline at the turn of the century and still exist today. A.C. Goode House, with nine floors, was built in 1892 and extended in 1903 by Best Overend &amp; Partners&amp;ndash;it is one of two of the only remaining historic skyscrapers in Melbourne. The building has been known under different names, including National Mutual Life Association Building, and most recently as the Bank of New Zealand Australia (BNZA) House. A.C. Goode House was constructed in a high [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] Revival style, in a beige freestone on a brick and concrete structure with a heavily vertical facade.&lt;ref name="A.C."&gt;{{cite web|title=A.C.

===1900s-1940s: Art deco and varying architectural styles===
[[File:Flinders Street Railway Station (16331352554).jpg|thumb|right|[[Flinders Street railway station|Flinders Street station]] (1909)]]
The turn of the century in Melbourne marked the [[federation of Australia]] in 1901. Following the extended period of wealth and prosperity after the discovery of gold in the 1850s, Melbourne's economy began to wane in the late 1890s after the closure of many banks and the city was overtaken by Sydney as the most populous urban area in Australia by 1901.{{sfn|Pennsylvania State University|1990|pp=60}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marvellous Melbourne – 1880s|work=[[Museum of Victoria]]|url=https://museumsvictoria.com.au/marvellous/1880s/index.asp|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remained a centre of importance thanks to its declaration as Australia's capital city, as the seat of government for the [[Commonwealth of Australia]]. [[Parliament House, Melbourne|Parliament House]], on [[Spring Street, Melbourne|Spring Street]], was constructed to accommodate the parliament of Australia, between 1855 and 1929 in [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical style]]. As a result of the economic downturn, the architecture began to reflect a more restrained style based less on Europe and more on the United States, particularly the [[Romanesque Revival architecture]].{{sfn|Griffiths|pp=77}} Economic revival in the 1910s saw a regeneration of building construction and growth. Melbourne's growth, and the advent of urban sprawl in the tradition of many other Australian cities, meant that the city needed a proper railway passenger terminus rather than the ad-hoc system it had at the time, with a collection of train sheds at the Flinders Street site. 

[[Flinders Street railway station|Flinders Street station]] was constructed after a contest was held in 1899, with 17 entries received.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Flinders Street Station: History of a Melbourne icon|date=10 November 2016|accessdate=10 December 2017|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/lifestyle/melbourne/flinders-street-station-in-pictures-a-melbourne-icon-for-162-years/news-story/|work=[[Herald Sun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition was essentially for the detailed design of the station building, since the location of the concourse, entrances, the track and platform layout, the type of platform roofing and even the room layout to some extent was already decided.{{sfn|Davies|pp=20}} The first prize, at £500, went to railway employees James Fawcett and HPC Ashworth of [[Fawcett and Ashworth]] in 1899. Their design, titled ''Green Light'', was of [[French Renaissance]] style and included a large dome and tall [[clock tower]].&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; The train shed over the platforms was intended to have many arched roofs running north-south, but only an alternative plan depicting impressively high three arched roof (running east-west) over the concourse survives&amp;ndash;the design was heavily modified in 1904. Over the next few years, the design was tweaked and work on the station building itself began in 1905. [[Ballarat]] builder Peter Rodger was awarded the £93,000 contract and the station was originally to be clad in stone, but this exceeded the allocated budget.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Red brick with cement render was chosen for the [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian style]] building. Work on the dome began the following year, and delayed construction saw a Royal Commission appointed in May 1910. The Way and Works Branch of the [[Victorian Railways]] took over the project, the station being essentially finished by mid-1909. The verandah along Flinders Street and the concourse roof and verandah along Swanston Street were not completed until after the official opening in 1910.{{sfn|Davies|pp=38}} The building has been repainted five times in its history, and the last repaint occurred in 2017. The most recent paint job was conducted to match the original colours as closely as possible, obtained through numerous samples of chipped paint which revealed the original colours after being cut in a polyester resin tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Flinders Street Station's new colours 'as close as possible' to original look thanks to science|work=[[ABC (Australia)|ABC]]|date=10 November 2017|accessdate=9 December 2017|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-10/science-of-flinders-street-station-new-look-paint/9135080}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Manchester Unity Building, Melbourne.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|The art deco [[Manchester Unity Building]] (1927)]]
Other styles followed the ensuing years of Australian federation, which rendered previously popular styles like Victorian and Queen Anne dated among the Australian cities. The styles of the early 20th century included [[Federation architecture]] and the rise of [[art deco]]. The rise of the suburbs in Melbourne meant that large acres of land could be purchased and homes could be designed in appointed styles of the land owners and home builders. One of the most popular styles was art deco, and several public city buildings were designed in this style, including the [[Manchester Unity Building]], which mixed art deco with Gothic Revival. The building was constructed in 1932 by the Manchester Unity I.O.O.F. in Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article205486959 |title=Manchester Unity Building. |newspaper=[[The Age]] |location=Melbourne |date=1 September 1932 |accessdate=24 January 2016 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other buildings in the art deco style include the [[T &amp; G Mutual Life Assurance Society|T &amp; G Building]] (1929), the [[Australasian Catholic Assurance Building]] (1935), [[Mitchell House, Melbourne|Mitchell House]] (1937) and which more closely resembles the [[Streamline Moderne]], and the [[Myer Emporium]] (1920). These contemporary styles mirrored an increasingly diversifying city, which reflected the changing architectural fashions. The Second World War saw fewer buildings constructed in Melbourne than in previous years. By the late 1940s, Melbourne boasted an array of styles the eras in which it prospered, including Victorian, Gothic, Queen Anne and the most flourishing style of the early 20th century&amp;ndash;art deco.

===1950s-present: contemporary architecture and lax heritage attitudes===

The arrival of the 50s saw contemporary high rise offices constructed and the [[ICI House]], built in 1955, was Australia's tallest building at the time.&lt;ref name="environment.gov.au"&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/places/national/ici-building/index.html Australian National Heritage listing for the ICI Building]&lt;/ref&gt; ICI House, breaking Melbourne's long standing 132&amp;nbsp;ft height limit, was the first [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] skyscraper in the country.&lt;ref name="environment.gov.au"/&gt; It symbolised progress, modernity, efficiency and the booming corporate power in a postwar Melbourne. Its development also paved way for the construction of other modern high-rise office buildings, thus changing the shape of Melbourne's already diverse urban centre. Melbourne was the first city in Australia to undergo a post-war high-rise boom beginning in the late 1950s, though [[Sydney]] in the following decades built more, with over 50 high-rise buildings constructed between the 1970s–90s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web|url=http://www.epress.monash.edu/ag/ag060008.pdf|title=Time Series Analysis of the Skyline and Employment Changes in the CBD of Melbourne|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SkyscraperPage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?searchID=62468583&amp;page=1|title=Melbourne Timeline Diagram|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s and 1970s were a period of lax attitudes towards the city's early heritage, and many commentators now view these years of rampant demolition as one akin to urban vandalism.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=88}} [[Whelan the Wrecker]], a now infamous demolition company, was responsible for most of the destruction towards most of Melbourne's historic buildings, notably the Federal Coffee Palace. A vast number of city hotels also closed in the 1950s, as a result of blighting liquor laws, which meant that the cost of running a licensed venue outstripped the return.{{sfn|Annear|pp=280}} This may have explained the dwindling patronage of Melbourne's grand hotels in the 1950s and 60s.

Another venue that shaped Melbourne's early architectural form is the [[pub]], a licensed drinking establishment traditionally built on corners within the inner-city and city centre. In the 1920s, there were about 100 corner pubs in Melbourne but this figure diminished to 45 by the 1960s. Today there are approximately 12 operating in the CBD – including The Metropolitan, which is located on the corner of [[William Street, Melbourne|William Street]], and first served beer in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Planning laws see speculators target last pubs standing on CBD corners|first=Clay|last=Lucas|work=[[The Age]]|date=7 June 2018|accessdate=8 June 2018|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/planning-laws-see-speculators-target-last-pubs-standing-on-cbd-corners-20180607-p4zjz8.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:140 william street.JPG|thumb|right|[[140 William Street]] (1972), an example of a contemporary high-rise office building prominent in central Melbourne.]]
In 1972, as a result of sustained pressure from the [[National Trust]], Victorian Parliament amended the [[Town and Country Planning Association (Victoria)|Town and Country Planning Act]] to include the "conservation and enhancement of buildings, works, objects and sites specified as being of architectural, historical or scientific interest". The act went onto specify the prohibition of "pulling down", "removal" or "decoration or defacement" to any such building. Because only specified sites were to be protected, the local councils across Melbourne had the task of allocating buildings and places that warranted protection. The [[City of Melbourne]] council specified the entire CBD as an area of significance in 1973. However, this blanket protection measure came unstuck in 1975 when the council was threatened with compensation payments to developers if their plans were rejected on heritage grounds. Despite this, most of the cities heritage buildings were already protected by that time under the authority of the Historic Buildings Act. However, the act involved representatives from real estate and [[corrupt]] development industries with ulterior motives. As a result, "developers [[white elephant]] schemes for central Melbourne proceeded virtually unchecked throughout the 70s"&amp;ndash;resulting in widespread loss of historic buildings.{{sfn|Annear|pp=358}}

====Skyscraper boom====
{{Main|List of tallest buildings in Melbourne}}

Between the late 1970s and 1980s, Melbourne's skyline reached new heights with the construction of several office buildings. Whelan the Wrecker went out of business in the early 1990s and heritage laws were tightened into the mid 1990s. In 1972, [[140 William Street]] (formerly known as BHP House) became the city's first building to exceed the height of 150 metres and was the tallest in Melbourne for a few years. It was constructed in steel and concrete and features an imposing dark glass facade. Designed by the architectural practice [[Yuncken Freeman]] alongside engineers Irwin Johnson and Partners, it was heavily influenced by contemporary skyscrapers in Chicago.  The local architects sought technical advice from [[Fazlur Khan]] of renowned American architectural firm [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] (SOM), spending 10 weeks at their Chicago office in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former BHP House|date=3 March 2000|accessdate=10 December 2017|url=http://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/4690/download-report}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The design ingenuity of 140 William Street was recognised as the building became one of the few heritage registered skyscrapers in Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scraping the sky: Melbourne's tallest buildings since 1871|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/scraping-the-sky-melbournes-tallest-buildings-since-1871/news-story/027cdc65cc68641be620cd696020e89f|work=[[Herald Sun]]|date=20 September 2017|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Optus Centre]], which surprised 140 William Street marginally, was completed in 1975. In 1977 [[Nauru House]] claimed the feat of the tallest building in Melbourne at a height of 182 metres. In 1978, the first of the [[Collins Place]] towers was opened, at a height of 185 metres. The design of Collins Place was based around a pair of towers at 45 degree angles to the [[Hoddle Grid]], with the triangular spaces between forming an open plaza to the street and a shopping plaza behind the towers. All open spaces are covered by a [[space frame]], with transparent plastic roofing. The whole complex is clad in tan-coloured precast masonry panels. In 1986, the [[Rialto Towers]] surpassed Sydney's [[MLC Centre]] as the tallest building in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], with a height of 251 metres. At the time of its opening it was the [[List of tallest buildings in the world#Tallest buildings in the world|23rd–tallest building in the world]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://skyscrapercenter.com/interactive-data/submit?type%5B%5D=building&amp;status%5B%5D=COM&amp;status%5B%5D=UC&amp;status%5B%5D=UCT&amp;status%5B%5D=STO&amp;base_region=0&amp;base_country=0&amp;base_city=0&amp;base_height_range=5&amp;base_company=All&amp;base_min_year=1885&amp;base_max_year=2000&amp;comp_region=0&amp;comp_country=2&amp;comp_city=0&amp;comp_height_range=3&amp;comp_company=All&amp;comp_min_year=1960&amp;comp_max_year=2016&amp;skip_comparison=on&amp;output%5B%5D=list&amp;dataSubmit=Show+Results Interactive Data – The Skyscraper Center]. ''[[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat]]''. Retrieved 11 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, another 9 buildings were constructed in Melbourne that exceeded 150 metres; 5 of these surpassed heights of 200 metres. [[101 Collins Street]], which is {{convert|260|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall}}, became the tallest building in Australia and the Southern Hemisphere in 1991; it was surpassed in height as a result of the completion of the nearby [[120 Collins Street]] that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacMahon|first1=Bill|title=The Architecture of East Australia: An Architectural History in 432 Individual Presentations|date=2001|publisher=Edition Axel Menges|isbn=3-930698-90-0|pages=171–72|chapter=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skyscraper, which stands at 265 metres in height, held the titles for tallest building in Australia and the Southern Hemisphere for fourteen years, until the completion of the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]]'s [[Q1 (building)|Q1]] in 2005.

Between 1996 and 97, a less admired Melbourne building became a target of demolition: the streamlined modernist Gas and Fuel Buildings. These structures were built in the late 1960s at a time when modernisation of the city was considered favourable.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=124}} The two towers, designed by Perrot and Parents, were also known as the Princes Gate Towers. As public opinion swayed back towards the desirability of 19th century heritage, the modernist Gas and Fuel Towers grew to be seen as "ugly and featureless", with no connection to the heritage that surrounded. The [[Jeff Kennett|Kennett Government's]] decision to demolish the modernist towers was generally met with approval, and the towers were demolished to make way for [[Federation Square]].{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=124}} A similar fate was met by Hotel Australia, built in a Functionalist/Moderne style in 1939 and demolished in 1989.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=110}} In 2008, one of the last remaining Victorian arcades in the Melbourne CBD was demolished under approval from the planning minister at the time [[Matthew Guy]]. The decision and the rapidity of the demolition created public outrage.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=134}} The building, Eastern Arcade and Apollo Hall, built in 1872, was constructed on the site of the old Haymarket Theatre. It was the third arcade to be built in Melbourne and larger than both Queen's Arcade and the [[Royal Arcade, Melbourne|Royal Arcade]]. The Eastern Arcade was designed by George Johnston and had 68 stores as well as an upper storey. Despite discussions held by the [[Melbourne City Council]] to preserve the building or at least its facade, the entire structure was torn down in 2008.

===New millennium architecture===
[[File:Melbourne Central Coops Shot Tower.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The interior of [[Melbourne Central Shopping Centre|Melbourne Central]], a mixed-use skyscraper that features an underground railway station and shopping mall.]]
The new millennium saw a tighter attitude towards heritage conservation and a construction boom in Melbourne. On the back of Australia's financial and mining booms between 1969 and 1970, and the establishment of the headquarters of many major companies in the city, resulted in a continual rise in large, modern office buildings being constructed.

The 2000s saw a continuation of skyscrapers and tall buildings with the urban renewal opening of the [[Melbourne Docklands]] in 2000 and the construction of [[Eureka Tower]], an apartment building which is currently Melbourne's tallest and the [[List of tallest buildings in the world|77th tallest in the world]] at 92 floors and 297 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eureka Sky Deck |accessdate=15 July 2012 |url=http://www.eurekaskydeck.com.au/fact-figure.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223142214/http://www.eurekaskydeck.com.au/fact-figure.html |archivedate=23 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The glass style building was constructed by [[Fender Katsalidis Architects]].

==Monuments and structures==
[[File:Shrine of Rememberance (11884180023).jpg|thumb|left|[[Shrine of Remembrance]] in [[King's Domain]]]]
Melbourne's metropolitan area is dotted with structures and memorials dedicated to various different historical events of significance. Perhaps the most notable, located in [[King's Domain]], is the [[Shrine of Remembrance]], an art deco monument originally built to honour the men and women who served in the First World War, but now seen as a symbol for all Australians involved in war. Designed by architects and World War I veterans [[Hudson and Wardrop|Phillip Hudson and James Wardrop]], the Shrine is built in a [[classicism|classical]] style and is based on the [[Tomb of Mausolus]] at [[Halicarnassus]] and the [[Parthenon]] in [[Athens, Greece]].{{sfn|Taylor|2008|pp=101}} The defining element located at the top of the memorial's ziggurat roof is based on the [[Choragic Monument of Lysicrates]].

The sanctuary contains the [[marble]] Stone of Remembrance, which features an inscription stating "Greater love hath no man". Beneath the sanctuary lies a crypt, which contains a bronze statue of a soldier father and son representing two generations, as well as panels listing every unit of the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]].
[[File:Spencer-street-power-station-melbourne.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Spencer Street Power Station]], demolished in 2008]]
[[Federation Square]], built on a concrete deck above railway lines, covering an area of 3.2 ha (7.9 acres), is a mixed-used development built in the early 2000s. The buildings in the square were designed in a [[deconstructivist]] style with modern minimalist shapes. The complex of buildings forms a rough U-shape around the main open-air square, oriented to the west. The eastern end of the square is formed by the glazed walls of The Atrium. While [[bluestone]] is used for the majority of the paving in the Atrium and St. Paul's Court, matching footpaths elsewhere in central Melbourne, the main square is paved in 470,000 [[ochre]]-coloured sandstone blocks from [[Western Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABC OPEN: Melbourne's first public square|work=ABC|date=28 June 2016|accessdate=10 December 2017|url=https://open.abc.net.au/explore/137871}}&lt;/ref&gt; and invokes images of the [[Outback]]. The paving is designed as a huge urban artwork, called ''Nearamnew'', by [[Paul Carter (academic)|Paul Carter]] and gently rises above street level, containing a number of textual pieces inlaid in its undulating surface. The square also contains a large television screen, which has broadcast a number of national addresses, including a 2007 speech from then Australian [[Prime Minister]] [[Kevin Rudd]], making an apology to the [[Stolen Generation]] of indigenous Australians. The square houses the [[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]] and the [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS Headquarters]].

Several other famous structures and monuments outside the CBD, many of them located in beachside suburbs like [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], were demolished or destroyed by fire. The dance hall Palais de Dance (1913) in St Kilda, built by Americans Leon and Herman Phillips, was destroyed by fire in 1968,{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=70}} Princes Court (late 1800s), featuring toboggan and a water chute, was closed in 1909, the St Kilda Sea Baths, featuring two large bathing houses, was built in 1860 and closed in 1993. The famous Spencer Street Power Station in the city centre, featuring a large 370-feet chimney (built in 1952), and widely considered an "eyesore", was demolished between 2008 and 2009.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=70}}

===Town halls and civic centres===
{{Main|List of town halls in Melbourne}}
[[File:South Melbourne Town Hall 002.JPG|thumb|right|The [[South Melbourne Town Hall]] (1879)]]
Each municipality in Melbourne is represented by its own [[town hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/4679|title=Victorian Heritage Database|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[City of Melbourne]]'s central municipal building is located on the northeast corner of [[Swanston Street|Swanston]] and [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins]] Streets&amp;ndash;it is the oldest town hall in Melbourne's metropolitan area, constructed in 1887 in Second Empire style, by the iconic local architect [[Joseph Reed (architect)|Joseph Reed]] and Barnes. The building is topped by Prince Alfred's Tower, named after the Duke. The tower includes a 2.44 m diameter clock, which was started on 31 August 1874, after being presented to the council by the Mayor's son, Vallange Condell. It was built by Smith and Sons of London. The longest of its [[copper]] hands measures 1.19 m long, and weighs 8.85&amp;nbsp;kg. The Main Auditorium includes a magnificent [[concert organ]], now comprising 147 ranks and 9,568 pipes.  The organ was originally built by Hill, Norman &amp; Beard (of England) in 1929 and was recently rebuilt and enlarged by [[Schantz Organ Company]] of the United States.

[[South Melbourne Town Hall]], which represented the now amalgamated areas of [[South Melbourne]], [[Port Melbourne]] and [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], is one of the second oldest town hall's and civic centres built in Melbourne, completed in 1879 in an elaborate Victorian Academic Classical style with [[Second Empire architecture in Europe|French Second Empire]] features, dominated by a very tall multi-stage clock tower. The building is on the [[Victorian Heritage Register]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/1520|title=South Melbourne Town Hall|work=Victorian Heritage Database|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bolte Bridge, Melbourne 2017-10-28.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bolte Bridge]] (1999)]]
Melbourne's positioning spanning the Yarra River, and on the coast, necessitates several water crossings. [[Bolte Bridge]], Australia's longest bridge, is a large twin [[cantilever bridge]] that spans the Yarra, and [[Victoria Harbour]] in the [[Melbourne Docklands|Docklands]], to the west of the [[Melbourne city centre]]. Bolte Bridge was designed by architects [[Denton Corker Marshall]] from 1996 to 1999 at a cost of $75 million. The bridge features two 140 metre&lt;ref name="dcm"&gt;[http://www.dentoncorkermarshall.com/experiences/infrastructure-transport/ Denton Corker Marshall: Bolte Bridge]&lt;/ref&gt; high silver (grey concrete) towers, situated on either side of the roadway at the midpoint of the bridge's span. These two towers are an aesthetic addition by the architects, and are not joined to the main body of the bridge.&lt;ref name="dcm" /&gt; Several other pedestrian bridges that cross the Yarra River, connecting [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]] to the Melbourne city centre were built between the 19th-century and the 1990s. The most notable early multi-purpose crossing of the Yarra is the [[Princes Bridge]], constructed in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite VHD|817|Princes Bridge|hr=1447|ho=790}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent example of a bridge crossing over the Yarra is the Evan Walker Bridge, completed in 1992.

The wrought-iron arch [[Queens Bridge (Melbourne)|Queens Bridge]], one of the oldest remaining bridges in the city, was constructed in 1889 has five wrought iron plate girder spans, and is listed on the [[Victorian Heritage Register]].&lt;ref name=qbhr1448&gt;{{Cite VHD|786|Queens Bridge|hr=1448|ho=791|accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Like many other Australian capital cities, Melbourne's suburbs and residential architecture has been shaped by the city's extensive history&amp;ndash;thus it is defined by a variation in style, ranging from elaborate Victorian properties to more contemporary postwar homes. To counter the trend towards low-density suburban residential growth, the government began a series of controversial public housing projects in the inner city by the [[Housing Commission of Victoria]], which resulted in demolition of many neighbourhoods and a proliferation of high-rise towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = William | first = Logan | title = The Gentrification of inner Melbourne: a political geography of inner city housing | publisher = University of Queensland Press | year = 1985 | location = Brisbane | pages = 148–160 | url = | id = | isbn = 0-7022-1729-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upper class suburbs like [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]] flourished during Melbourne's [[gold rush]] era and feature remnants of the prosperous past, as does [[South Yarra]], [[Malvern, Victoria|Malvern]] and various other eastern suburbs. These areas have [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]], [[Tudorbethan]], [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and Victorian architecture in abundance, among many other styles. More middle class areas like [[Camberwell, Victoria|Camberwell]] and [[Caulfield, Victoria|Caulfield]] are characterised by [[Bungalows]]. American architects like [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Louis Sullivan]] have also had influence on the residential style of Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Melbourne Architecture|first=Phillip|last=Goad|work=Watermark Press|year=1999|ISBN=094928436X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Church of St Donatus''' is a church located in [[Zadar]], [[Croatia]]. Its name refers to [[Donatus of Zadar]], who began construction on this church in the 9th century and ended it on the northeastern part of the [[forum (Roman)|Roman forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} [http://www.amzd.hr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=49 Arheološki Muzej Zadar - Sveti Donat]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Originally named Church of the [[Holy Trinity]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inyourpocket.com/croatia/zadar/sightseeing__culture/essentialzadar/venue/4537-St_Donatus_and_39;_Church.html Essential Zadar], inyourpocket.com; accessed 31 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 15th century it was re-dedicated to St Donatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} [http://www.izaberi.hr/index.php?lang=hr&amp;op=sd&amp;tip=zna&amp;id=0000060 Crkva sv. Donat], izaberi.hr; accessed 31 July 2018.{{hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church is the largest [[Pre-Romanesque]] building in Croatia. It is also an example of the centralised type of the [[Carolingian]] period in Europe.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==History==
The beginning of the building of the church was placed to the second half of the 8th century, and it is supposed to be completed in the 9th century. The Zadar bishop and diplomat [[Donatus of Zadar|Donat]] (8th and 9th centuries) is credited with the building of the church. He led the representations of the Dalmatian cities to [[Constantinople]] and [[Charles the Great]], which is why this church bears slight resemblance to Charlemagne's court chapels, especially the one in [[Aachen]] (now [[Aachen Cathedral]]),&lt;ref name="Radovinovič"&gt;{{cite book|last=Radovinovič|first=Radovan|title=The Croatian Adriatic|year=1998|publisher=Naklada Naprijed|location=Zagreb|isbn=953-178-097-8|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also to the [[Basilica of San Vitale]] in [[Ravenna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raos|first=Ivan|title=Adriatic tourist guide|year=1969|publisher=Spektar|location=Zagreb|OCLC=112865|pages=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=OCGhTcSQCcLt0gH08v22Bg&amp;ct=result&amp;hl=cs&amp;id=AQgzAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=chirch+of+saint++donatus+zadar&amp;q=%22Vitale%27s+Church+in+Ravenna%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It belongs to the Pre-Romanesque architectural period.

The circular church, formerly domed, is 27 m high and is characterised by simplicity and technical primitivism. It has three radially situated [[apse]]s and an [[ambulatory]] around the central area, surmounted by circular gallery. The circular shape is typical of the early medieval age in [[Dalmatia]].&lt;ref name=desc/&gt; It was built on the Roman forum, and materials from buildings in the latter were used in its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cvitanic|first=Marilyn|title=Culture and Customs of Croatia (Culture and Customs of Europe)|year=2010|publisher=Greenwood; 1st ed|isbn=978-0-313-35117-4|page=200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hpPXFbq9vO4C&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=chirch+of+saint++donatus+zadar&amp;hl=cs&amp;ei=Tx6hTZagMqTh0gHm_cj7BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the fragments which are built into the foundations it is still possible to distinguish the remains of a sacrificial altar on which is written IVNONI AVGUSTE IIOVI AVGUSTO.&lt;ref name="Radovinovič"/&gt;

The  use of the church has varied during its lifetime; during the rule of the [[Republic of Venice]] it was a warehouse, as well as during the French occupation and under the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austrians]]. After the city was annexed to [[Yugoslavia]], it served as an archaeological museum for a short period of time. The building is currently used as the concert venue for the annual International Festival of Medieval Renaissance Music ([[Musical Evenings in St Donatus]]) due to the building's interiors and acoustics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donat-festival.com/default.asp?lang=en Official site of the Donat musical evenings], donat-festival.com; accessed 31 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Designer toys''', also called "Art Toys", are novelty toys and collectibles created by independent artists and designers, which they usually produce in [[limited edition]]s. Artists use a variety of materials, such as [[ABS plastic]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], [[wood]], [[metal]], [[latex]], and [[resin]]. Many designer toys are [[plush toys]]. Creators often have backgrounds in [[graphic design]], [[illustration]] or self-described [[Lowbrow (art movement)|low brow]] art; some artists have classical art and design training, while others are self-taught. The first designer toys appeared in the 1990s.

==Overview==
A typical example of designer toys are the [[Qee]] series, produced in [[Hong Kong]] by [[Toy2R]]. The standard size of [[Qee]] figures is 2" high, but 8" and 16" figures are also produced. Qees vary in their design, usually with the same basic body type, but with head sculpts that may be of a bear, a cat, a dog, a monkey, or a rabbit. Variations of the Qee are the ''Toyer'' with a head that resembles a cartoon skull; the ''Knuckle Bear'', which was created by Japanese character designer [[Touma (designer)|Touma]], and resembles a [[graffiti]]-style [[caricature]] of an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] bear; and the Qee ''Egg'', a [[Bird|bird's]] [[egg (biology)|egg]] with arms and legs. ''Blank'' Qees are produced in 2" and 8" sizes; these figures may be of any Qee sculpt, but are packaged unpainted, as [[Do it yourself|do-it-yourself]] pieces. Each piece is designed by an artist and carries its own [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] [[Motif (visual arts)|theme]]. Each 2" figure is packaged with an optional [[keychain]] attachment.

Another example of designer toys is the Dunny series, produced by the American company [[Kidrobot]]. Dunny figures may be considered the Western counterpart of the Chinese [[Qee]] and the Japanese [[Be@rbrick]]. Dunny are a series of figures that resemble anthropomorphized rabbits in a cartoon style (a design originally illustrated by graffiti, [[stencil]], and [[Comics|comic]] artists) which are produced as 3", 8", and 20" figures. There is a variation of the Dunny figure called a [[Munny]], which resembles a monkey, and is only sold as an unpainted do-it-yourself piece. Some creators of designer toys are [[Hong Kong]]-based [[Michael Lau]], credited with the establishment of the Urban Vinyl movement; [[Devilrobots]], a five-person design team from Japan, known for their [[television]] character named TO-FU Oyako;&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Amos. "Design Style". ''Newtype USA'' '''6''' (11) 142&amp;ndash;143. November 2007. {{ISSN|1541-4817}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican artists Carlos &amp; Ernesto East "The Beast Brothers" which are known for their [[Dia de muertos]] and [[Aztec]] influences; American concert poster artist [[Frank Kozik|Frank Kozik's]] Mongers series and Labbit character; and British illustrator James Jarvis' cast of characters, produced as vinyl figures of varying sizes.

Most vinyl toys are produced in factories in China, though some designers have shifted production to Japan where higher quality materials such as clear vinyl are used. Designer toys are rarely produced in the United States due to environmental restrictions on the production of vinyl, some exceptions are resin and plush toys.

==Urban vinyl==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Bigfootvinyl.jpg|right|thumb|120px|''Bigfoot'', an example of an urban vinyl toy, designed by San Francisco artist Bigfoot One, produced by STRANGEco in conjunction with Fifty24SF Gallery{{Pufc|1=Bigfootvinyl.jpg|log=27 March 2010}}]] --&gt;
'''Urban vinyl''' is a type of designer toy, featuring [[action figure]]s in particular which are usually made of [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]]. Although the term is sometimes used interchangeably with the term designer toy, it is more accurately used as a modifier: not all designer toys can be considered urban vinyl, while urban vinyl figures are necessarily designer toys, by virtue of the way in which they are produced. Like designer toys in general, urban vinyl figures feature original designs, small production numbers, and are marketed to collectors, predominantly adults.

What sets "urban" designer toys apart from general "designer" or "art" toys, is the subject matter. Anything dealing with graffiti, hip-hop, rap or other subjects typically tied to an urban environment.

The urban vinyl [[Fads and trends|trend]] was initiated by artist Eric So &amp; Michael Lau, who first created urban vinyl figures in Hong Kong in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/15/magazine/15DOLL.html?ei=5035&amp;en=9618348bd208ce1a&amp;ex=1178942400&amp;partner=MARKETWATCH&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;position=| last=Lubow| first=Arthur| title=Cult Figure| date=15 August 2004| work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sacbee"&gt;{{Cite news| title=Not kids play| last=Leibrock| first=Rachel| date=6 January 2004| work=[[The Sacramento Bee]]| url=http://www.sacbee.com/content/lifestyle/v-print/story/8052930p-8987066c.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other creators of urban vinyl figures are Japanese artist and designer [[Takashi Murakami]] whose work has been exhibited in the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo]], and the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], Australian designer [[Nathan Jurevicius]]'s [[Scarygirl]], based on characters from his comic of the same name, and produced in conjunction with Hong Kong company [[Flyingcat]], and former graffiti artist [[KAWS (artist)|KAWS]].

Urban vinyl figures are designed primarily by  illustrators, graffiti artists, musicians and [[Disc jockey|DJs]] from [[Urban culture|urban]] areas in Asia (especially Japan and Hong Kong), [[North America]] (especially the United States), and [[Europe]].

An offshoot of [[hip hop]] and youth-oriented [[popular culture]], urban vinyl often depicts real-life figures from Asian and American culture, particularly artists who perform in a hip-hop or related styles. Two examples are Lau's depiction of the [[Lazy Mutha Fucka|LMF]] rappers from Hong Kong, and figures based on the members of the virtual electronic band [[Gorillaz]], produced by Jamie Hewlett and made by Kidrobot.

Urban vinyl is commonly designated as either Eastern Vinyl, including anything designed and produced in Asia or Australia, or Western Vinyl, encompassing pieces which are designed and produced in North America, [[South America]], or Europe. Urban vinyl figures have become [[collectable|collectible]] items. Rare pieces may sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.&lt;ref name="millionaire"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.millionaireplayboy.com/toys/urbanvinyl.php| first=Kristian [Jager]|last=Yeager|title=A Look at Urban Vinyl and Where it Came From| year=2004| work=Millionaire Playboy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resin toys==
Some artists create their toys using synthetic [[resin]] material and [[resin casting]]. After casting the resin toy receives adjustments in its details, sometimes being superficially cast on some parts. The toy can be finished using automotive paint by aerosol and sometimes receives a varnished layer above the dry painting.

The process of making resin toys is more labor-intensive and time-consuming than industrialized vinyl toy production, which in most of cases are made identical and in large quantities. But resin casting allows artists to produce toys in small numbers. Most vinyl factories will only produce toys in large series. Resin toys have become a way for less established artists to produce a toy without the large financial investment required to produce a vinyl toy. Unlike most vinyl toys, resin toys are usually sculpted, cast, and painted by a single artist as shown in the book "We are indie Toys" by [[HarperCollins]] {{ISBN|9780062293435}}.&lt;ref name="IndieToys"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bou | first = Louis | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = We Are Indie Toys | journal = [[HarperCollins]] | volume =  | issue =  | pages = | date=  February 2014 | url =  | doi = | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designer plush==
Designer plush, a subcategory of designer toys, are soft, stuffed dolls created in limited quantities by artists and designers. Common designs include [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] animals or [[fantasy|fantastic]] human likenesses, although designer plush dolls often feature entirely unique character designs. Designer plush dolls are usually given names and [[persona]]s, with their distinctive personalities described on their tags or in booklets included in their packaging.

One producer of designer plush is [[Friends With You]], a commercial art and design collective based in [[Miami]], [[Florida]]. Their work is characterized by a cute yet bizarre aesthetic, and exhibits a hand-made quality, even in pieces that are machine-made. In addition to their plush dolls, Friends With You also create [[Modular design|modular]] wood toys, and [[motion graphic]]s for companies such as [[Sony]], [[MTV]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], and [[Columbia Records]].

Another type of designer plush are [[Uglydolls]], created by independent toy designers David Horvath and Sun-Min Kim under the label Pretty Ugly. Their first products were 12" plush dolls based on drawings by David Horvath’s, and handmade by Sun-Min Kim. Pretty Ugly has also produced 7" versions of their character designs, called ''Little Uglys'', 24" versions called ''Giant Uglys'', 4" miniatures intended for use as keychains, and in a departure from the plush medium, 7" ''Vinyl Uglys''. With Ugly Dolls being featured in motion pictures like Zarthura and in major specialty stores the brand has gone from exclusive to Mass appeal in mainstream.&lt;ref name="Hollywood goes Ugly"&gt;{{Cite web| title = The Hollywood Toyboy | work = TD Monthly | url = http://www.toydirectory.com/monthly/article.asp?id=1492 | author = TDmonthly Staff | date = 1 September 2005 | accessdate = 2008-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designer consumer electronics==
A recent addition to the world of vinyl toys, '''designer consumer electronics''' is a subcategory started by [[mimoco]], whose [[mimobot]] Art Toy [[USB flash drive|Flash Drives]] proved that there was a market for Urban Vinyl products with a purpose. Like other platform art toys, there have been mimobot designs by a wide variety of artists, including [[Mori Chack]], [[Sket One]] and [[Jon Burgerman]]. The appeal of designer consumer electronics in flash memory form tends to be the addition of a digital canvas, allowing affiliated artists to create much more in-depth characters, complete with animations, music, etc.

Designer consumer electronics are not limited to mimobots; in 2007, [[Medicom]] brought out a [[Be@rbrick]] [[USB flash drive]].[http://www.lafab.us/brand/Xoopar Xoopar]  designs the XBoy line of Bluetooth speakers

[[Image:BD Dhaki.JPG|right|150px| thumb| A dhaki at [[Dhakeshwari Temple]], [[Dhaka]]]]
'''Dhakis''' ({{lang-bn|ঢাকি}}) are traditional drummers who play the [[Dhak (instrument)|dhak]] (drum) during [[Hindu]] festivals, primarily in [[Bengal]]. Drum beats are an integral part of the five-day-long annual festivities associated with Durga [[Www.onlinepurohit.com|Puja]]&lt;ref name ="Durga"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.durga-puja.org/tradition.html  | title = Traditions of Durga Puja| accessdate = 13 January 2008 | last = | first =  | work =  | publisher = Society for confluence of festivals in India }}&lt;/ref&gt; but dhakis are losing out to pre-recorded CDs and [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]].&lt;ref name="Statesman3"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thestatesman.net/page.arcview.php?clid=10&amp;id=52924&amp;usrsess=1

==The players==
Dhakis perform mostly in [[Durga Puja 2007|pandals]] of [[barowari]] pujas, starting from [[Viswakarma]] Puja till [[Kali Puja]], but are most prominent during [[Durga Puja]]. For the latter festival Kolkata has over 2,000 pandals, with numerous more in the districts. Even a small pandal without the beat of dhaks is unimaginable. Every makeshift tent has a dhak.&lt;ref name="Statesman1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thestatesman.net/page.news.php?clid=30&amp;id=185669&amp;usrsess=1 | title = Think Again:Crime and No Punishment| accessdate = 13 January 2008 | last =Gandhi | first =Maneka  | work =8th Day  | publisher =''The Statesman'', 13 January 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]] '' writes "Durga Puja does not assume the festive aura without the maddening beats of the dhak, the large drum that men hang around their necks and play with two thin sticks to infuse the frenzied rhythm into listeners. Those enchanting beats are enough to conjure up the sights and smells of Durga Puja."&lt;ref name="Statesman2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thestatesman.net/page.arcview.php?clid=22&amp;id=158534&amp;usrsess=1
| title = Beats of changing time| accessdate = 13 January 2008 | last =Bhattachatya | first =Kajari  | work =Kolkata Plus  | publisher =''The Statesman'', 26 September 2006}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Well, a bit of correction is required here-the thing is that the Dhak is hung around the shoulder of the player ... ... ... and not the neck ... and played with two thin stick ... one a little thicker than the other ... .known as (Kathis).

The nuances of playing the instrument are handed down from generation to generation, but the old rhythms are undergoing changes. The rhythm is no longer as slow as in earlier generations. Nowadays, dhakis opt for faster rhythms. Earlier, different beats were used for specific aspects of Durga Puja, as for example ''chokhhu daan'' (eye presentation), ''patha bali'' (goat sacrifice), ''bisarjan'' (immersion ceremony), ''sandhya arati'' (evening offerings), ''sandhipuja'' (worshiping at the conjunction of two phases), and so on.&lt;ref name="Statesman2"/&gt;

Dhakis who cannot learn within the family typically take training under a guru to become a good dhaki, as is the case for most musical instruments. Some take six months to become mature players, while others do not even learn after three or four years. Many young dhakis nowadays are moving towards modern rhythms. Bikram Ghosh, a renowned tabla player and a patron of dhakis in Bengal, opines,  "some dhakis do go the commercial way out of necessity. But most know the basic rhythms that have been taught to them by their ancestors."&lt;ref name="Statesman2"/&gt;

The occasions when the dhak was played are changing. Apart from pujas or religious festivities, dhakis are also called to play in markets before Durga Puja when people crowd in large numbers. Sometimes, they are called for store inaugurations.&lt;ref name="Statesman2"/&gt;

==Outside Bengal==
[[Bengali people|Bengali]] communities outside Bengal get dhakis from Bengal for Durga Puja. In [[Delhi]] around 400 Durga Pujas are organised. Many of the older and established pujas have their fixed dhakis, but others engage free-lancers who arrive on their own in Delhi just before the pujas. Some 100 dhakis travel to Delhi from [[Malda district|Malda]] and [[Medinipur]]. Not all of them are engaged and some return empty handed.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-09-26/delhi/27808669_1_dhakis-durga-puja-metal-detectors | title = Beating their drums| accessdate = 13 January 2008 | last =Ghosh | first =Abantika  | work =  | publisher =''Times of India'', 26 September 2006 | date=26 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Durga Puja is the time for the dhakis to earn some money. They are generally landless farmers and play the dhak in their villages when they have time to spare. The cost of a dhaki in Delhi is a little more than it is in Kolkata. It costs around [[Rs.]] 3,000 to 4,000 per dhaki plus Rs. 2,000 for the accompaniments.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

The dhakis routinely brave police harassment to reach the capital with their large dhaks. With terrorism in the air, the harassment has increased. Even after checking with metal detectors for guns and bombs, the police do not allow them to go unless they pay. The return journey is more hazardous because they have money in their pockets.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

Dhaks appear in the numerous Durga Puja pandals at [[Patna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2001-10-22/patna/27258467_1_durga-puja-bengali-akhara-pandals | title = Come Puja, Patna doesn't miss the touch of Bengal | accessdate = 13 January 2008 | last =Singh | first =Bhanu Pratap  | work =  | publisher =''Times of India'', 22 October 2001 | date=22 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Jamshedpur]], they also have a competition for dhakis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.telegraphindia.com/1021014/asp/jamshedpur/story_1290116.asp | title = Drummers set festival rhythm – Dhaki contest adds to Aambagan Durga Puja attraction | accessdate = 13 January 2008 | last = | first =  | work = PTI  | publisher =''The Telegraph'', 14 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhakis travel to far way places like [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]] and [[Kochi, India|Kochi]] for Durga Puja.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2007082760651100.htm&amp;date=2007/08/27/&amp;prd=th&amp; | title = Bengalis celebrate Onam in Kochi | accessdate = 13 January 2008 | last = | first =  | work = National  | publisher =''The Hindu'', 27 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2006/09/26/stories/2006092600700100.htm | title = At ease… away from home| accessdate = 13 January 2008 | last = Ramamoorthy | first = Mangala  | work = Metro Plus Hyderabad  | publisher =''The Hindu'', 26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sushil Das, a dhaki from Sukbazar village near [[Bolpur]] had an invitation to go to the United States, but could not accept it because of his lack of knowledge of English. A highly skilled dhaki, he can play six dhaks at a time. Some Indians residing in the USA were impressed by his performance in a puja pandal in Delhi and offered to take him to the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thestatesman.net/page.arcview.php?clid=22&amp;id=120762&amp;usrsess=1

==Changing times==
The art of playing the dhak is now being referred to as a dying profession,this is sad but true. While some of the dhakis may be lucky to retain old contacts, many are facing a decline and some are moving away from the traditional profession. Take the example of the seventy dhaki families in Amrul, a village in [[Bankura district]]. Ancestors of the dhakis were on the rolls of [[History of Bankura district#Bishnupur kingdom|Malla kings]] of [[Bishnupur (Bankura)|Bishnupur]]. Daily pujas were organised for the deities in the palace and the dhakis played a significant role. Times have changed. One of them was offered Rs. 800 for playing the dhak for five days. It is a pittance. Some of the younger generation even took to work as shoe shine boys, but the older generation still has pride in being artists. They look down upon such misadventures of the younger generation, but do not have an alternative before themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.thestatesman.net/page.arcview.php?clid=23&amp;id=53673&amp;usrsess=1
| title = Drumbeats of a dying profession | accessdate = 13 January 2008 | last = Siddiqui| first = Kanchan | work = Bengal Plus | publisher =''The Statesman'', 16 October 2003}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nottopara, in the [[Ashoknagar Kalyangarh]] area of [[North 24 Parganas district]], is a locality of dhakis, who came as refugees from [[East Bengal]]. The locality is named after them, and some thirty-five to forty families live there. They regret, "earlier, we used to be treated like any other artist. Today, we are just another component of the Puja paraphernalia, who are supposed to perform on those days." Earlier, they used to be from around Mahalaya, but now go only for the five days. The importance of dhakis has diminished because of some people's preference for electronic music and bands. These days, some of the Nottos make dhaks. A dhak made of mango wood and goat skin sells for around Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,500, leaving a profit of only Rs 50. Some have taken to other professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thestatesman.net/page.arcview.php?clid=23&amp;id=85127&amp;usrsess=1
| title = Dhakis the ones less looked forward to this Puja | accessdate = 13 January 2008 | last = | first =  | work =Bengal Plus  | publisher =''The Statesman'', 12 October 2004}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another Nattapara in [[Hooghly district]], a remote village in [[Balagarh]] block. There are some 100 dhakis in the village. There is not a single family without a dhaki. All used to go out to work as dhakis during the festive season, but now the demand has declined to such an extent that many are forced to give up the traditional profession and work as wage labourers. Worse still, a dhaki from the village was contacted by a well-known Durga Puja in [[Kolkata]] for Rs. 2,000. After he had performed his duties they paid him less and insulted him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thestatesman.net/page.arcview.php?clid=6&amp;id=3272&amp;usrsess=1 | title = Dhakis lose out to cassettes  | accessdate = 13 January 2008 | last = | first =  | work = Bengal  | publisher =''The Statesman'', 3 October 2002}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not an isolated incident and there are similar complaints from dhakis in the [[Tarakeswar]] and [[Dhaniakhali]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thestatesman.net/page.arcview.php?clid=23&amp;id=85127&amp;usrsess=1 | title = Dhakis the ones less looked forward to this Puja | accessdate = 13 January 2008 | last = | first =  | work =Bengal  | publisher =''The Statesman'', 12 October 2004}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dhakis are losing out to technology. While music shops do brisk business in selling pre-recorded CDs and [[compact cassette|cassette]]s for anything between Rs. 23 and 40, dhakis find it hard to earn Rs. 150 to Rs. 200 per day, poor compensation considering the cost or hire charges of the dhak, the training that the dhaki must undergo, and the effort involved.&lt;ref name="Statesman3"/&gt; pley

Yet there are Dhakis like Dhaki Gokul Chandra Das,of Maslondopur and Ashutosh Colony Habra, North 24 parganas,believs that the Dhak is similar to any other percussion instrument played in a concert or a stage performance, such as the Tabla,Pakhwaj,or Mridangam. If a Tabalchi can show case his talent on stage in front of a large audience, so can a Dhaki ... He believes that the dhak can be played in accompaniment to any kind of music,including songs (Rabindra Sangeet), similar to the Tabla,and not just for the Durga Puja or any other puja; and he has proved it. He now participates in stage performances with Pandit Tanmoy Bose and his group of talented musicians. Recently he also performed in a reality TV show,(Sa re Ga Ma Pa,) on Z Bangla, in accompaniment to songs.So it is hard time the Dhakis learnt to use their inheritant music in other ways, to make a living and at the same time to keep the art of playing the Dhak alive and enchant the world with their magical rhythms at times other than the Durga Puja. People need to recognise the Dhak as a percussion instrument no different than any other percussion instrument that can be seen on stage.

==Killing of birds==
[[Maneka Gandhi]], an [[animal rights]] activist, says that dhakis try to attract the attention of puja organisers by decorating the dhaks with bird [[feather]]s. She charges that "Dhakis kill more than 40,000 [[egrets]], [[pheasants]], [[herons]] and open bill [[storks]] every year. The killing increases with each passing year. Murshidabad, Nadia, Burdwan, Birbhum and Bankura are notorious for this misdeed."&lt;ref name="Statesman1"/&gt;

The feathers of wild birds play an indispensable role in controlling pests. However dhakis use these to decorate the drums.It assists in attracting the attention of [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] organisers.&lt;ref name="Statesman1"/&gt;

All the birds killed are protected species and the open bill stork is endangered. In India, it is illegal to trap, sell, hunt, buy or kill any wild bird under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972. The crime is a non-bailable one and anyone convicted of killing a protected bird can be imprisoned for up to seven years and/or fined Rs. 25,000. Under the Act, it is illegal to buy or sell animal parts. They are sold anywhere in the range between for Rs. 300 to Rs. 600 per kilo.&lt;ref name="Statesman1"/&gt;

The law exists, but law keepers turn a blind eye to it.&lt;ref name="Statesman1"/&gt;

==Documentary film==
[[Gautam Chattopadhyay]] has made a documentary film about dhakis.

'''''Doina''''', or '''''Doină''''' (sometimes translated as "Lament"),&lt;ref&gt;Mihăilescu, p. 92; Neubauer, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[political poem]] by the Romanian [[Mihai Eminescu]]. It was first published in [[1883 in literature|1883]] and is therefore seen by some as Eminescu's final work in verse, although it may actually be an 1870s piece, inspired or enhanced by the perceived injustice of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Berlin Treaty]]. A variation of the ''[[doina]]'' (plural: ''doine''), picked up from [[Romanian folklore]], it is noticeably angry to the point of rhetorical violence, a radical expression of [[Romanian nationalism]] against invading "foreigners", noted for its hints of [[ecopoetry]] and "[[Technophobia|anti-technicist]]" discourse. ''Doina'' delineates the ideal geographical space of [[Greater Romania]], at a time when Romanian-inhabited regions were divided between an [[Kingdom of Romania|independent kingdom]] and multinational empires. Its final lines call on [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]], depicted as a [[sleeping hero]], to take up the cause of Romanians and chase foreigners out with the sound of his horn. The same basic themes appear in another poem by Eminescu, the anthem-like ''La arme'' ("To Arms"), which is sometimes discussed as a variant of ''Doina''.

Expressly [[Anti-Russian sentiment|anti-Russian]], also read as [[antisemitic]], [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]], [[Anti-Greek sentiment|anti-Greek]], [[Anti-Hungarian sentiment|anti-Hungarian]], and [[Anti-Ukrainian sentiment|anti-Ukrainian]], ''Doina'' has been described as "chauvinistic" and "minor" by some critics, "beautiful" by others. It has been present in the [[Education in Romania|Romanian curriculum]] since the 1890s, while also serving as subversive literature among Romanian communities in the [[Russian Empire]]. During the interwar, with Greater Romania established as a political reality, ''Doina'' became a rallying call for revolutionary nationalists and fascists. It was deemed problematic and [[Censorship in Communist Romania|censored]] during the [[Communist Romania|communist period]], although tacitly endorsed under the regime's latter, [[National communism in Romania|national-communist]], phase. It returned in focus during the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]] and after, when it also became a public symbol of Romanian identity in [[Moldova]].

==Outline==
''Doina'' opens with a localization of the Romanian space, highlighting regions which were at the time in Russia and [[Austria-Hungary]]:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|De la Nistru pân-la Tisa
Tot românul plânsu-mi-s-a
Că nu mai poate străbate
De-atâta străinătate.}}
|
From the [[Dniester]] to the [[Tisza]], 
All Romanians have complained to me, 
That they could not succeed 
Because of all the foreigners.
}}&lt;small&gt;—''translation by Mirela Adăscăliței, in Oișteanu, p. 199''&lt;/small&gt;

Eminescu moves focus  on [[Bessarabia]], depicted as raided by "''[[Moskal|muscali]]''" on horseback; on [[Bukovina]], with foreigners as "caterpillars" and stalkers of the local Romanians; then on [[Transylvania]], crossed by the foreigners' "inroads". Overall, the projected country is aflush with intruders and the Romanian is a "foreigner in his own land"; birds are chased away, songs are extinguished, and the forest, "brother of the Romanian", is depleted. The description of this desolate landscape ends in imprecation:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Cine-au îndrăgit străinii
Mânca-i-ar inima câinii [...]}}
|
He to whom foreigners are dear
Let the dogs eat his heart [...]
}}&lt;small&gt;—''translation by James Christian Brown, in Boia, p. 59''&lt;/small&gt;

The ending of ''Doina'' is Eminescu's contribution to a "trans-historical"&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; cult of Prince Stephen:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Ștefane, Măria Ta,
Tu la Putna nu mai sta,
[...]
Tu te-nalță din mormânt
Să te-aud din corn sunând
Și Moldova adunând!
De-i suna din corn o dată
Ai s-aduni Moldova toată,
De-i suna de două ori
Îți vin codrii-n ajutor,
De-i suna a treia oară
Toți dușmanii or să piară,
Din hotară în hotară  [...]}}
|
Stephen your Highness, 
Do not stay in [[Putna Monastery|Putna]] 
[...] 
Rise up from your grave 
That I may hear your horn sounding 
And Moldavia gathering. 
If the horn sounds once, 
You will gather all Moldavia, 
If it sounds twice, 
The woods will come to your aid, 
If it sounds three times, 
All the enemies will perish 
From border to border [...]
}}&lt;small&gt;—''translation by Brown, in Boia, pp. 194–195''&lt;/small&gt;

==Background==

A poet as well as a folklorist, Eminescu was well acquainted with the traditional forms of Romanian poetry, and wrote several poems in folkloric style—his Transylvanian enemy, [[Alexandru Grama]], could therefore claim that Eminescu had simply plagiarized Transylvanian ''doine''.&lt;ref&gt;Grama, pp. 204–205&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Eminescu expert [[Perpessicius]], one of his first published works, taken up by ''[[Familia (magazine)|Familia]]'' in the 1860s, was a "type of ''[[doina]]''" or a "pseudo-''doina''".&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (2001), pp. 142, 414&lt;/ref&gt; Another variation on that pattern is addressed to "His Majesty, The Forest" (''Codrule, Măria ta''), with the poet asking to be turned into a tree branch, rocking into eternal slumber.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 195, 220–221&lt;/ref&gt; Seen by scholars as an early draft of ''Doina'', it was described as "hollow" and "rudimentary" by critic Constanța Marinescu.&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Călinescu, such works sound less "gauche" than actual folk poetry, as polished for print by [[Vasile Alecsandri]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarily, Perpessicius asserts that Eminescu was less talented that Alecsandri, never matching his work as a folklorist or folklore-inspired versifier.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (2001), p. 427&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholar Marin Bucur, Marinescu is essentially wrong in treating the draft as an actual poem, and also in failing to see why ''Doina'' itself is a worthy piece.&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, pp. 375–376&lt;/ref&gt;

Eminescu's interest in ''doine'' only peaked after 1877, when he was living as a journalist in [[Bucharest]], and began systematic readings from collections of folk poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (2001), pp. 325, 441–442&lt;/ref&gt; They were integrated into a vast fund of drafts and versions for ''Doina'', which, as noted by Perpessicius, cannot realistically be published together as a critical instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (2001), pp. 395, 401&lt;/ref&gt; In its final form, ''Doina'' is popularly associated with the unveiling at [[Iași]] in June 1883, of a monument to Prince Stephen. Eminescu was by then erratic and fatigued, displaying, already from May 1883, the early stages of a mental breakdown.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 165; Perpessicius (1944), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Lodging with [[Ion Creangă]] in Iași, he shocked his old friend by brandishing a revolver, explained by the poet as a defense against unspecified enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; He never actually attended the unveiling of Stephen's statue, only showing up for parallel ceremonies at ''[[Junimea]]'' society. It was there that he first read his ''Doina'', on June 4.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 165; Grama, pp. 203–206; Irimia (1984), pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The audience was reportedly enthusiastic, and moved in to hug Eminescu.&lt;ref&gt;Grama, pp. 204–205; Irimia (1984), p. 1; Perpessicius (1944), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; ''Doina'' was first published by the ''Junimist'' monthly ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' on July 1.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (1944), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

An emotional Creangă later claimed that his friend had written the poem over those few days, at Creangă's own home, the peasant-style ''[[Ion Creangă Memorial House, Iași|Bojdeuca]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Gorovei]], ''Alte vremuri. Amintiri literare'', pp. 62–63. Fălticeni: J. Bendit, 1930&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar [[Dumitru Caracostea]] similarly believes that ''Doina'' is the last of Eminescu's poems, composed just before "his collapse in 1883".&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; This is contradicted by other accounts. Researcher D. Murărașu believes that Eminescu had actually completed the poem 13 years before, while present at Putna for Prince Stephen's commemoration, and merely reused it for the 1883 feast.&lt;ref name="zodoctr"/&gt;

Eminescu expert Dumitru Irimia groups ''Doina'' and ''[[Luceafărul (poem)|Luceafărul]]'' into Eminescu's "final effort". He proposes that Eminescu, sensing his "mental equilibrium" slipping away, concentrated on finishing up both works, which outline his universal and social queries.&lt;ref&gt;Irimia (1984), pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt; However, he dates the earliest recognizable drafts of ''Doina'' to 1878, and Eminescu's anger over the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Berlin Treaty]], which awarded the [[Budjak]] to Russia, noting parallels with the author's political columns, taken up by ''[[Timpul]]'' in the early 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Irimia (1984), pp. 2, 4 &amp; (2003), pp. 140–142&lt;/ref&gt; According to Perpessicius, while the poem's references to rail transport may correspond to the unraveling of the [[Strousberg Affair]], ''Doina'' is the product of 1878, written "a day after [the Budjak's] cession [...], five years before the celebrations in Iași". He believes that ''Doina'' was in any event completed in December 1882, which was the original date set for the inauguration of Stephen's statue.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (1944), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
===Xenophobia debate===
Himself a nationalist, [[Nicolae Iorga]] described the piece as both "beautiful" and "political", marked by Eminescu's "hatred of an unrelenting foreign invasion".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolae Iorga]], ''Istoria literaturii românești contemporane. I: Crearea formei (1867–1890)'', p. 293. Bucharest: [[Adevărul|Editura Adevĕrul]], 1934&lt;/ref&gt; Without endorsing the political message, critic [[Nicolae Manolescu]] also found Eminescu's piece aesthetically pleasing.&lt;ref name="dc-enm"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Daniel Cristea-Enache]], [[Nicolae Manolescu]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20170808093243/https://www.literaturadeazi.ro/rubrici/autobiografice/2784-2784 "Autobiografice. Despre bucuria lecturii"], in ''Literatura de Azi'', November 27, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators disagree with these verdicts. Constantin Coroiu describes ''Doina'' as "not a masterpiece, not even a small one",&lt;ref name="cczamf"&gt;{{ro icon}} Constantin Coroiu, [http://revistacultura.ro/nou/2012/09/duiliu-zamfirescu-basarabia-si-bucovina/ "Duiliu Zamfirescu, Basarabia și Bucovina"], in ''Cultura'', Nr. 389, September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Z. Ornea]] includes it among Eminescu's lesser poems, a "modest work in verse".&lt;ref name="zodoctr"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/un_doctrinar_legionar_de_azi "Un doctrinar legionar de azi"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 37/2000&lt;/ref&gt; Essayist [[Nicolae Steinhardt]] took an intermediary position. While he recognized ''Doina'' as inferior to Eminescu's [[philosophical poetry]], he proposed that the verse still had "beauty bubbling like [[geyser]]s", the beauty of "[[Thracians|Thracian]] rocks collapsing".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.revista-apostrof.ro/articole.php?id=2016 "N. Steinhardt către I. Negoițescu: Trei scrisori inedite"], in ''[[Apostrof]]'', Nr. 2/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Grama, who saw himself as a fellow nationalist, accused Eminescu of insincerity, noting that the message of ''Doina'' contrasted first and foremost with Eminescu's own recourse to "cosmopolitan" themes in his other work.&lt;ref&gt;Grama, pp. 40–41, 90–91, 203–204&lt;/ref&gt; Also according to Grama, the "idiotic" poet wrote apocalyptic verse at a time when Romanians' fates were actually improving.&lt;ref&gt;Grama, pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; This verdict is not shared by other commentators. In 1934, critic [[Mihail Dragomirescu]] argued that ''Doina'' and ''[[Scrisoarea III]]'' contained Eminescu's "innermost thoughts", which led to [[Simion Bărnuțiu]], "Romanianism", and "national mysticism".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mihail Dragomirescu]], ''Istoria literaturii române în secolul XX, după o nouă metodă. Sămănătorism, poporanism, criticism'', pp. 11–12. Bucharest: Editura Institutului de Literatură, 1934&lt;/ref&gt; Caracostea defines the poem as an "excruciating ethnic elegy", and a sample of the "liveliest indignation"—reserved by Eminescu for politics and social commentary.&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, pp. 244, 291&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholar [[Lucian Boia]], Eminescu's poetry is overall the best expression of an "anti-cosmopolitan" drive in Romanian nationalism. Boia sees ''Doina'' as sketching out Eminescu's "dream": "a pure Romanian civilization, untouched by foreign influences and still less by the effective presence of foreigners."&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Irimia notes the work for "absolutely confound[ing]" the poetic self with national identity,&lt;ref&gt;Irimia (1984), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; "taking on the historical being of the Romanians [and] harmonizing it with the sacred dimension of the universal being."&lt;ref name="Irimia 2003, p. 140"&gt;Irimia (2003), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; According to musicologist Carmen Manea, both ''Doina'' and ''Scrisoarea III'' resemble in intent [[Frédéric Chopin]]'s ''[[Polonaise]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Nicolae Mareș, [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/eminescu_i_chopin__similitudini_i_paralele "Eminescu și Chopin – similitudini și paralele"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 24/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexandru Asachi, ROMANIA cotropita de Evreĭ și Strainĭ, Almanahul de Învățătură, 1875.jpg|thumb|250px|''Romania overrun by the Jews and the Foreigners'', in an 1875 allegory by Alexandru Asachi]]
The poem is one of "national revival", looking forward to a [[Greater Romania]] comprising all the Romanian-inhabited regions and, as argued by comparatist Călin-Andrei Mihăilescu, is "explosive" in "deplor[ing] the alienation of Romanians in their own lands".&lt;ref&gt;Mihăilescu, pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; Literary historian John Neubauer notes ''Doina''{{'}}s "chauvinistic remarks",&lt;ref&gt;Neubauer, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  while Bernard Camboulives refers to its "notes of xenophobia", stemming from a "growing intellectual despair". These, Camboulives notes, "might shock those readers who are unfamiliar with Romanian history".&lt;ref&gt;Camboulives, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening lines vaguely mention "foreigners", but the portion may refer to the situation in Eminescu's own Bukovina, specifically to relatively recent presence there of Germans, Ukrainians, and especially [[Bukovina Jews]].&lt;ref name="pzpoet"&gt;{{ro icon}} Petru Zugun, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/ZUGUNian12.htm "M. Eminescu—'Poetul național', nu scriitor xenofob, antisemit și rasist. Argumentare lingvistică și stilistică"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oișteanu, pp. 197–200&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholar Petru Zugun, there is nothing specifically xenophobic or antisemitic about ''Doina'', whose introductory portion is simply a critique of "unproductive foreigners", some of whom happened to be Jews, immigrating to Bukovina. Zugun further argues that Eminescu was even more critical of his co-nationals, when these were unproductive.&lt;ref name="pzpoet"/&gt; Manolescu acknowledges that background is xenophobic, targeting Russians, Jews and [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarians]]. However, he argues that the poem, unlike Eminescu's articles, can be appreciated without such "sociological" hints.&lt;ref name="dc-enm"/&gt; Critic [[Alex. Ștefănescu]] explains ''Doina'' as "sentimental, not ideological", to be understood as a declaration of love to Romania. He also notes that Eminescu was writing after "century-long dramas" provoked by "foreign occupations or by foreigners peacefully infiltrated, but never really integrated, into Romanian society, never giving up on their ethnic solidarity."&lt;ref name="alșlect39"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alex. Ștefănescu]], [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/lecturi-la-prima-vedere-din-eminescu-xxxix-de-alex-stefanescu-14892828 "Lecturi la prima vedere din Eminescu (XXXIX)"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', November 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by culture critic [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]], Eminescu was a xenophobe who, overall, preferred the Jews to the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|Romanian liberals]], viewing the former as more honest and reliable.&lt;ref&gt;Ibrăileanu, I, pp. 158–159&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary historian [[Leon Volovici]] also sees Eminescu as guided by an economic theory, but notes his vision of an "objective conflict" between Romanians and foreigners, including in particular Jews ([[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] or not) and [[Greeks of Romania|Greeks]]; the "apocalyptic" ''Doina'' formed part of that discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Volovici, pp. 11–13&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romania's Jews]], Eminescu insisted, were most removed from the authentically Romanian peasantry, and therefore "could not merge with our people."&lt;ref name="Volovici, p. 13"&gt;Volovici, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Draft versions of the poem make explicit mention of "Stephen's Romanians" being "in kike hands", and record with alarm the spread of [[Yiddish]] in Bukovina.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (1944), pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; Another manuscript proclaims specific curses against the perceived enablers of Jews, Greeks, and Russians; for instance:

The Bukovina themes had appeared in several Eminescu ''doine'', notably including an 1877 stanza in which Eminescu, or his peasant inspiration, describes the region at "the mercy of the foreigner, which is like a thistle's shadow".&lt;ref&gt;Irimia (2003), pp. 140–141&lt;/ref&gt; The latter metaphor is also found in ''Doina'', suggesting "the image of poverty sweeping over the country [...]. In times of drought, the thistle's shadow is more desolate than no shadow at all, a mock-offering to the heat-stricken people."&lt;ref name="așdrum"/&gt; A specific reference to the village of [[Boiany|Boian]], in ''Doina''{{'}}s ninth line, has contributed to that locality's notoriety in a Romanian cultural context.&lt;ref name="pzpoet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ștefan S. Gorovei, "Ion Neculce și tradițiile Putnei", in ''Analele Putnei'', Vol. I, Issue 2, 2005, p. 62; Ibrăileanu, II, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Another discernible issue is anger over the plight of Romanians in Russia's [[Bessarabia Governorate]], which included the Budjak.&lt;ref name="pzpoet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cazacu, pp. 6, 8; Irimia (2003), pp. 140–141; Pleșca, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Irimia, the two occupations appear as a continuum in Eminescu's lyrical universe.&lt;ref&gt;Irimia (2003), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; The Bessarabian topic is addressed in a parallel poem, referring to the Russians as "[[Cynocephaly|dog-headed]]" and "dog-hearted" [[Kalmyks]], likely to "tear out the tongues" of Romanian-speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Pleșca, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; The early versions of ''Doina'' still made mentions of "[[Tatars|Tatar]] and Kalmyk hordes".&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (1944), pp. 4–6, 11&lt;/ref&gt; Also from the period, ''La arme'' ("To Arms"), sometimes seen as a ''Doina'' variant,&lt;ref name="lc10"&gt;Letiția Constantin, "Eminescu muzical. Partituri aflate în Colecțiile Speciale ale Bibliotecii Naționale a României", in ''Conferințele Bibliotecii ASTRA'', Nr. 144/2011, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; urges Romanians to answer the call of "gentle Bessarabia", "our younger sister", "awaiting to be murdered by dogs".&lt;ref&gt;Burlacu, p. 382; Irimia (2003), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditionalism and biblical echoes===
According to Steinhardt, the central message is not xenophobic, but "ecological", "[[Technophobia|anti-technicist]]", and "obviously [[Heideggerian]]", its violence being Eminescu's attempt to fend off an "ancient curse". This reading refers in particular to a line which mentions the "iron road" (the [[Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways|Austrian rail company]]) bringing in foreigners to "kill all the songs", as well as to the claim that the forest and the Romanian are like "brothers".&lt;ref name="nst326"&gt;Zaharia Sângeorzan, [[Nicolae Steinhardt]], "Dialog cu monahul de la Rohia. 326", in ''Convorbiri cu Zaharia Sângeorzan și Nicolae Băciuț'', [n. p.]. Iași: [[Rohia Monastery]] &amp; [[Polirom]], 2015.  {{ISBN|978-973-46-5594-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same lines are also highlighted by critic [[Barbu Cioculescu]]: "That Eminescu was our first environmentalist is an established fact, beyond all debate [...]. The construction of railways across the country's virgin plains, centenary forests, and murmuring waters drove him to despair".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Barbu Cioculescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/btrnul_i_ploaia "Bătrânul și ploaia"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 42/2005&lt;/ref&gt; Ștefănescu rejects literal readings of the "iron road" verse, noting that Eminescu stood not for an aversion to progress, but rather against the "brutal destruction of a slowly emerging harmony", an "irreversible destruction of beautiful things."&lt;ref name="așdrum"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alex. Ștefănescu]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20170808132650/https://www.literaturadeazi.ro/rubrici/un-vers-de-eminescu/si-cum-vin-cu-drum-de-fier-4698 "«Și cum vin cu drum de fier...»"], in ''Literatura de Azi'', January 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Trains have first appeared as instruments of corruption in [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]]'s "Iron Road" (1864), which exegets such as Liviu Marian saw as "quasi-identical" with the passage in ''Doina'', and which is primarily about the Strousberg scandal.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (1944), pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Several commentators focus on the poem's prophetic outbursts and their literary sources. Some see ''Doina'' as primarily a curse, similar to [[Basil of Caesarea|Saint Basil]]'s exorcism&lt;ref name="nst326"/&gt; or to the [[Kosovo curse]], in the [[Vuk Karadžić]] version.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Gerard Gallagher|Tom Gallagher]], ''Outcast Europe: The Balkans, 1789–1989: From the Ottomans to Milošević'', pp. 57–58. London &amp; New York: [[Routledge]], 2001.  {{ISBN|0-415-27089-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Ștefănescu, Eminescu changes the meaning of words, turning the mere fondness of strangers into a punishable crime: "[He] can make words into soft twigs, sketching on the surface of water, and also into daggers."&lt;ref name="alșlect39"/&gt; Al. Andriescu, the Biblical scholar, argued that the central themes, of national perdition and redemption, are echoes of the ''[[Psalms]]'', arriving at Eminescu through his readings from [[Dosoftei]].&lt;ref&gt;Antofiychuk, p. 8; {{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/resursele_psalmilor "Resursele psalmilor"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 31/2005&lt;/ref&gt; Building on this verdict, Ukrainian researcher Volodymyr Antofiychuk proposes that ''Doina'' is a parallel to [[Taras Shevchenko]]'s own psalmodic verse. Both authors, Antofiychuk notes, invoked the Bible specifically against Russian expansionism.&lt;ref&gt;Antofiychuk, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Although rejecting Eminescu's overall contribution, including most of ''Doina'', Grama reserved praise for this final scene, calling it a "masterpiece", when viewed separately: "most Romanians cannot fail to be moved" by it.&lt;ref&gt;Grama, pp. 203–204&lt;/ref&gt; Comparatist [[Grete Tartler]] proposes that the "famous invocation" deepens folkloric accounts about Stephen as a [[sleeping hero]], on par with [[Ogier the Dane]] and [[Frederick Barbarossa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Grete Tartler]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/naiuni_pragmatice_identitatea_danez "Națiuni pragmatice: identitatea daneză"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 45/2001&lt;/ref&gt; Camboulives explains his presence in these lines as an appeal to Stephen's standing as a powerful enemy of the [[Ottoman Empire]], and defender of "the whole of Christendom."&lt;ref&gt;Camboulives, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Ștefănescu argues that Eminescu appealed primarily to the "Romanian mythology", of Stephen as an "unvanquished hero".&lt;ref name="alșlect39"/&gt;

==Legacy==
===Becoming a symbol===
''Doina'' was included by [[Titu Maiorescu]] in his first-ever critical edition of Eminescu's poems, published at [[Editura Socec]] as the author had withdrawn from public life. The "classic" selection and arrangement, which place ''Doina'' right before "[[One Wish Alone Have I]]", were praised by Perpessicius as particularly tactful.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (2001), pp. 73–74, 348–349&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, critics were flummoxed by Maiorescu's apparent carelessness, which, in poems such as ''Doina'', proliferated known typos.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (2001), pp. 351–357&lt;/ref&gt; The Socec collection is known for missing an entire line of the poem, alluding to the foreigners' reliance on the "iron road".&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (2001), pp. 352, 355–356&lt;/ref&gt; The corrected version of ''Doina'' was published in February 1884 by Maiorescu's rivals at ''[[Contemporanul]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (2001), p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; Socec itself amended the text in its revised edition of 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (2001), pp. 357–358&lt;/ref&gt; ''La arme'' remained unpublished until 1902, but was widely known through its musical adaptation by [[Eduard Caudella]], which is probably from 1883.&lt;ref name="lc10"/&gt; Caudella himself believed that the work was a suitable anthem, "the Romanians' ''[[Marseillaise]]''".&lt;ref name="lc10"/&gt; Another version, circulated in the [[Banat]] by Liviu Tempea, was sung to the tune of ''[[Chant du départ]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Constantin-T. Stan, [https://web.archive.org/web/20170810131312/http://www.ziarulactualitatea.ro/un-lugojean-pe-urmele-lui-eminescu-pianistul-compozitor-liviu-tempea-2/ "Un lugojean pe urmele lui Eminescu: pianistul-compozitor Liviu Tempea (2)"], in ''Actualitatea'', September 28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of ''Doina'' as an object of study in academia was I. Manliu's manual of [[poetics]], published in 1890 and heavily indebted to Maiorescu's observations, closely followed in 1893 by [[Enea Hodoș]]'s reader, aimed at Romanian schoolteachers in the Banat, and by Gheorghe Adamescu's [[chrestomathy]].&lt;ref name="mamanua"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mircea Anghelescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/eminescu_n_manualele_colare "Eminescu în manualele școlare"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 11/2000&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Kingdom of Romania]], three literature textbooks for schoolchildren included ''Doina'' before 1900.&lt;ref name="mamanua"/&gt; The poem was also part of the theatrical repertoire, recited during intermissions by [[Aristizza Romanescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ștefan Cervatiuc, ''Istoria teatrului la Botoșani: 1838–1944. Vol. 1: 1838–1900'', p. 201. Botoșani: Quadrant, 2008.  {{ISBN|978-606-8238-88-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga's associate [[A. C. Cuza]], who published in 1914 a "people's edition" of Eminescu's work, set apart a section for the ''doine''.&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; The cover had art by [[Ipolit Strâmbu]], depicting the final scene of ''Doina'', with Stephen sounding his horn.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (2001), p. 366&lt;/ref&gt; As noted at the time by Ibrăileanu, nationalism permeated the reading of Eminescu's work: while ''Doina'' and ''Scrisoarea III'' could still "serve nationalism", most of his poetry could not. Ibrăileanu argues that this realization prompted [[Ilarie Chendi]] and others to seek the publication of Eminescu's other, lesser and unfinished, prose works.&lt;ref&gt;Ibrăileanu, II, pp. 232–233&lt;/ref&gt; The poem, and especially its reference to the "iron road", was also popular with the socialist ''Revista Socială'', which saw the old gentry and the peasants as equally threatened by modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Ibrăileanu, I, pp. 164–165&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900, Eminescu's posthumous followers included [[Duiliu Zamfirescu]], who wrote a ''Doina''-like poem specifically about Bukovina,&lt;ref name="cczamf"/&gt; and the Bukovinan [[Radu Sbiera]]. According to Ibrăileanu, the latter, being an "untalented Eminescian", was inspired by ''Doina'' to the point of plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;Ibrăileanu, II, pp. 38, 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, ''Doina'' also inspired the critically acclaimed debut of [[Octavian Goga]], a Transylvanian.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/octavian_goga_-_125_-_mesianism_naional "Octavian Goga – 125 – Mesianism național"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 18/2006&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was already an established political symbol, circulated clandestinely in Bessarabia by [[Ion Pelivan]]. Pelivan was arrested by the [[Special Corps of Gendarmes]] in 1903. During the inquiry, Pelivan reports, the Gendarmes produced an incompetent translation of ''Doina'' into Russian, missing out on its more inflammatory rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;Ion Constantin, Ion Negrei, Gheorghe Negru, ''Ioan Pelivan: istoric al mișcării naționale din Basarabia'', p. 369. Bucharest: Editura Biblioteca Bucureștilor, 2012.  {{ISBN|978-606-8337-39-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Doina'' was subsequently used as a rallying call in 1912, during the centennial of Bessarabia's annexation by Russia. Its recitation headlined the "festival" organized in Bucharest by the [[Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians]].&lt;ref&gt;Cazacu, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The respite of censorship following the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] ultimately produced a blossoming of the Romanian Bessarabian press, including ''[[Cuvânt Moldovenesc (magazine)|Cuvânt Moldovenesc]]''—which, in 1913, put out an Eminescu selection, featuring both ''Doina'' and ''Codrule, Măria ta''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Petre V. Haneș]], ''Scriitori basarabeni, 1850–1940'', pp. 290–300. Bucharest: Editura Casei Școalelor, 1942.  {{OCLC|935507473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Volovici notes, Eminescu's rhetoric partook in "exacerbat[ing] the negative image of the foreigner and stimulated xenophobia."&lt;ref name="Volovici, p. 13"/&gt; As reported by writer [[A. A. Luca|Avram Axelard (A. A. Luca)]], ''Doina'' had also become an anthem for "Christian boys" in Bukovina, who used it as a justification to punch him and other Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Oișteanu, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Greater Romania===
Two years after the Cuza edition, the Romanian Kingdom [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|entered World War I]] as an [[Allies of World War I|Entente country]]; the alliance favored the Russian Empire over Austria-Hungary, and the cause of Transylvania over that of Bessarabia. During [[Romania in World War I|the subsequent campaigns]]. ''La arme'' was a soldiers' anthem, used for instance during Nerva I. Paul's charge on German positions (October 1916).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Victor Durnea, [http://revistacultura.ro/nou/2011/05/profesorul-criticul-si-scriitorul-ioan-paul-itinerar-biografic/ "Profesorul, criticul și scriitorul Ioan Paul. Itinerar biografic"], in ''Cultura'', Nr. 322, May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Romania contemplated [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|defeat in early 1918]]. Writing at the time in ''[[Chemarea]]'', the Jewish critic [[Benjamin Fondane]] reminded Iorga and other nationalists of the anti-Russian content of ''Doina'', which, he argued, had been proven right.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Benjamin Fondane|B. Fundoianu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/mihail_eminescu_poezii "Recenzii: Mihail Eminescu, ''Poezii''. Inscripții"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 26/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The following months and years saw the creation and consolidation of Greater Romania, beginning with the [[union of Bessarabia with Romania]]. The culmination of the process was a "[[Great Union Day]]" (December 1, 1918), during which Romanians from Transylvania and satellite regions expressed their wish to join the country. Though invoked on the day, the slogan "From the Dniester to the Tisza" caused some controversy, as delegates from [[Northern Maramuresh]] found that it excluded their homeland. The matter was addressed by a Transylvanian delegate, [[Ștefan Cicio Pop]], who endorsed the new slogan: ''Trăiască România Mare de la Nistru și până dincolo de Tisa!'' ("Long live Greater Romania from the Dniester to the Tisza and beyond!").&lt;ref&gt;Ana-Felicia Diaconu, Cristina Țineghe, "Istorii puțin știute. Cum s-a unit Maramureșul cu țara", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', December 1999, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In interwar Bessarabia, ''Doina'' continued to have an especially strong presence as a political symbol and poetic model, while ''La arme'' was quoted as an opening text by the literary review ''[[Viața Basarabiei]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Burlacu, pp. 382, 387–388&lt;/ref&gt; ''Doina'' was also a major of influence on the anti-Russian poetry published at the time by [[Ion Buzdugan]].&lt;ref&gt;Burlacu, p. 388; Iordan Datcu, "Ion Buzdugan și cântecele din Basarabia", in ''Philologia'', Vol. LV, 2013, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the left-wing [[Emilian Bucov]] parodied the poem, revising its central message:
{{Verse translation|

Eminescu's poem had become universally present in literature textbooks, and was for the first time made accessible to the youngest cohorts by the reading aids of [[Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică]].&lt;ref name="mamanua"/&gt; It also influenced sculptor [[Ion Schmidt-Faur]], who in 1929 added a ''Doina''-inspired relief, of Stephen and his horn, at the base of his Eminescu statue in Iași.&lt;ref name="85ani"&gt;{{ro icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20140728044003/http://curierul-iasi.ro/85-de-ani-de-la-dezvelirea-statuii-lui-mihai-eminescu-11515 "85 de ani de la dezvelirea statuii lui Mihai Eminescu"], in ''[[Curierul de Iași]]'', June 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Before and during and World War II, the work was several times transposed into foreign languages.

Bucharest: [[Editura Militară]], 2013.  {{ISBN|978-973-32-0922-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From ca. 1927, ''Doina'' was also especially popular with the [[Iron Guard]], a fascist movement which similarly "express[ed] the ancestral, somehow atemporal, sense of Romanian purity and solidarity among Romanians" and gave Stephen an "exceptional position" in its propaganda works.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was also invoked by the [[National Christian Party]], which shared the Guard's antisemitism and was sometimes allied with it. Its leader was the poet Goga, who used the lyrics to justify crimes committed by the Guard's Captain, [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], calling ''Doina'' a "gospel of Romanianism."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Nicolae Manolescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/octavian_goga_1_aprilie_1881-7_mai_1938 "Octavian Goga (1 aprilie 1881–7 mai 1938)"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 14/2011&lt;/ref&gt; The same appropriation happened with ''La arme''.

Bucharest: [[Editura Universității București]], 2014.  {{ISBN|978-606-16-0520-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; As recalled by Cioculescu, during the [[National Legionary State]] the same slogan was "plastered all over the walls" of Romanian cities, "as if the Guard didn't have its own foreigners!"&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Barbu Cioculescu]], [http://www.editurapleiade.eu/Reviste/2016%20Acolada%20nr.%2001.pdf "Diagrama unui mit"], in ''Acolada'', Nr. 1/2016, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communist censorship===
In late 1944, shortly after [[King Michael's Coup]] and the onset of [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation in Romania]], ''La arme'' was banned.&lt;ref name="lc10"/&gt; At the time, Iron Guard commandos, supported by [[Nazi Germany]], used ''Doina'' as a password.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Manuel Stănescu, [https://www.historia.ro/sectiune/general/articol/generalul-avramescu-tradator-sau-victima-a-nkvd "Generalul Avramescu, trădător sau victimă a NKVD?"], in ''Historia'', April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Under the subsequent [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]], ''Doina'' was also targeted by [[Censorship in Communist Romania|political censorship]]: already in 1946, the quotation from ''Doina'' was removed from Schmidt-Faur's relief.&lt;ref name="85ani"/&gt; The poem could not be published in Bessarabia, which was included in the Soviet Union as the [[Moldavian SSR]]. In both countries, it was "banned and recited only in private readings because it named Russia as one of the imperial powers that had oppressed the Romanian nation."&lt;ref&gt;Neubauer, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Also uncomfortable were its "strident nationalism" and its mention of the Dniester, "at the time in the territory of the Soviet Union."&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Philologist [[Petru Creția]] also argued that ''Doina'' upset the communist rulers because they themselves were mostly "foreigners [...], extremely offended by the things one read in there".&lt;ref name="cczamf"/&gt;

In Western countries, the anti-communist [[Romanian diaspora]] still published and discussed the poem. Diaspora journalist [[Virgil Ierunca]] noted at the time that Eminescu was both praised and censored with the acquiescence of a compliant [[intelligentsia]]. He highlighted this against the oppression experienced by the other social groups, quoting ''Doina''{{'}}s "all Romanians have complained to me".&lt;ref&gt;Mihaela Albu, "Virgil Ierunca — A Prestigious Voice of the (Literary) Romanian Exile", in Adina Ciugureanu, Ludmila Martanovschi, Nicoleta Stanca (eds.), ''Ovid, Myth and (Literary) Exile.

Constanța: [[Ovidius University Press]], 2010.  {{ISBN|978-973-614-559-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem's nationalist prestige was preserved by the self-exiled Iron Guard poet, [[Aron Cotruș]], who wrote many pieces which allude to Eminescu's, in both style and intertexual references, updated to refer to communism and the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Florin Manolescu, [http://www.viataromaneasca.eu/arhiva/96_via-a-romaneasca-3-4-2015/80_istorie-i-literatura/2092_scriitori-romani-in-exil-un-rapsod-modern-aron-cotrus.html "Scriitori români în exil — Un rapsod modern: Aron Cotruș"], in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 3–4/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissidents at home also maintained a cult of the poem. As noted by Creția, ''Doina'' had a psychological appeal: "those who hid it under a bushel were mistaken, with this poem preserving a latent life in the national psyche; thus, the censors, instead of attenuating an obsession, have maintained it."&lt;ref name="cczamf"/&gt; Historian [[Zoe Petre]] recalls having been taught ''Doina'' as a youth, "in the summer of '44", which was already a gesture of defiance from her family.&lt;ref name="zpnistru"&gt;[[Zoe Petre]], "De la Nistru pân' la Tisa...", in ''Toamna căpitanului'', [n. p.].

The [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968]] brought anti-Russian sentiment to the forefront, allowing [[Sabin Drăgoi]] to compose and circulate a third musical version of ''La arme''.&lt;ref name="lc10"/&gt; In the 1970s, following the [[National communism in Romania|deterioration of contacts]] between Romania and the Soviet Union, communist leader [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] became more lenient toward ''Doina''. At a Communist-Party plenary meeting early that decade, he reportedly cited the imprecation about dogs "eating the hearts" of xenophiles.&lt;ref name="nmcenz"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Nicolae Manolescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/cenzura_comunist_i_literatura "Cenzura comunistă și literatura"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 51/2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, Ceaușescu proposed to publish a collection of Eminescu's "national" poetry, headlined by ''Doina''{{'}}s apparent claim to Bessarabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/stenograma_edinei_comitetului_politic_executiv_al_cc_al_pcr_din_ziua_de_5_mai_1976 "Stenograma Ședinței Comitetului Politic Executiv al CC al PCR din ziua de 5 mai 1976"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 13–14/2014&lt;/ref&gt; Actor Ludovic Antal was reportedly the first to test censorship by publicly reciting ''Doina'', at some point before his death in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Valeriu Birlan, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/BIRLANnov8.html "Scrisoare inedită – Veturia Goga"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; References to ''Doina'' were still stripped from the 1977 Romanian edition edition of an Eminescu study, by the Frenchman Alain Guillermou.&lt;ref name="Irimia 2003, p. 140"/&gt; A French translation was done by Jean-Louis Courriol,&lt;ref&gt;Camboulives, pp. 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; but, as Courriol himself recalled, could still not be published in Romania in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Iulian Ciocan, [https://www.europalibera.org/a/25162192.html ''Scriitorii din Moldova nu se deosebesc de scriitorii din România, chiar dacă au o altă experiență și trăiesc într-o altă lume'' (interview with Jean-Louis Courriol)], [[Radio Free Europe]], November 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; At around that time, [[Cezar Ivănescu]] wrote a pastiche of ''Doina'' with a covert critique of communism; this was detected, then eliminated, by the censors.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ion Buzași, [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/jurnalul_unui_editor "Jurnalul unui editor"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 35/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

By then, [[Adrian Păunescu]] of ''[[Cenaclul Flacăra]]'' was staging public readings of ''Doina'' in Romania. Sometimes broadcast by radio, these were also followed by Romanian activists in the Moldavian SSR.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolae Dabija (politician)|Nicolae Dabija]], "Poetul și Basarabia", in ''[[Literatura și Arta]]'', June 18, 2013, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; There, the poem had remained banned in the [[Brezhnev Era]], with [[Nicolae Lupan]] threatened and ultimately expelled from the country for having circulated it.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Igor Cașu]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20170807174012/http://plural.upsc.md/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Plural-3-Casu.pdf "'Revoluția silențioasă': revizuirea identității naționale în Moldova Sovietică la apogeul 'dezghețului' lui Hrușciov (1956–1957)"], in ''Plural'', Vol. 3, Issue 1, 2015, pp. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt; With the onset of ''[[Perestroika]]'' reforms in the Soviet republic, the magazine ''Nistru'' published all versions of ''Doina'' in its first issue of 1988,&lt;ref&gt;[[Valeriu Matei]], "25 de ani de la adoptarea legislației lingvistice", in ''Akademos'', Nr. 3/2014, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; an initiative credited to poet [[Dumitru Matcovschi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Petru Paraschivu, [http://bibliopolis.hasdeu.md/index.php?bpa=1827 "Dumitru Matcovschi – portret în timp"], in ''Biblio Polis'', Vol. 39, Issue 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; From her home in the [[Latvian SSR]], Maria Macovei-Briedis published the Romanian magazine ''Glasul'', which also took up ''Doina'' in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Tudor Nedelcea, [http://revistaramuri.ro/index.php?id=146&amp;editie=11 "Flori duhovnicești pentru mitropolitul Nestor Vornicescu"], in ''[[Ramuri]]'', Nr. 5/2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recovery===
At the Eminescu centennial, some eleven months before the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], ''Doina'' was publicly quoted in Ceaușescu's own address. As noted by Slama-Cazacu, the message was read at the [[Romanian Atheneum]] by [[Emil Bobu]], who happened to be "one of [Ceaușescu's] least cultured ministers."&lt;ref name="ts-ctext"/&gt; The issue of ''Doina'' came up during long debates over the publication of Eminescu's complete works. The project was endorsed by philosopher [[Constantin Noica]], who proposed putting out facsimiles from Eminescu's manuscripts. He acknowledged in 1977 that some were problematic for the regime, "xenophobic, anti-Russian", and suggested to "leave ''Doina'' out of it [...], we'll do it like type-writer girls—this we erase, the rest can appear."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cassian-Maria Spiridon]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/TATAian9.html "Noica și Eminescu (II)"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Ceaușescu ultimately allowed Creția to republish ''Doina'' in a lithographic edition which reproduced the Maiorescu original.&lt;ref name="nmcenz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Eliza Dumitrescu , [http://jurnalul.ro/scinteia/special/centenarul-mortii-poetului-national-511329.html "Centenarul morții poetului național"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', June 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to Petre, this was originally planned as a regular-type edition, but Creția, who defended the inclusion of ''Doina'', struggled with censorship for several years. During one episode of this exchange, he proposed changing "from the Dniester to the Tisza" to "from the [[Danube|Istros]] to the Tisza", which excluded reference to Bessarabia; "Dniester" would only be clarified in the [[erratum]].&lt;ref name="zpnistru"/&gt;

The poem was again fully accessible during the revolutionary events, its opening lines used by the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] in its first appeals to the Iași populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Laurențiu Ungureanu, [http://adevarul.ro/news/societate/iasi-cronica-revolutii-n-a-existat-1_50ac99047c42d5a663868229/index.html "Iași: cronica unei revoluții care n-a existat"], in ''[[Adevărul]]'', May 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Also then, actor [[Victor Rebengiuc]] walked into the [[Romanian Television]] building and recited the poem in a live broadcast, changing stress from its condemnation of foreigners to read like an attack on people associated with the old regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ovidiu Șimonca]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Inca-nu-ma-consider-un-actor-mare.-Interviu-cu-Victor-REBENGIUC*articleID_19305-articles_details.html " 'Încă nu mă consider un actor mare' " (interview with Victor Rebengiuc)], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 412, February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eminescu expert Cornelia Viziteu, there followed a period of "overtly nationalist" readings with "evidently superficial commentary", including popularization of ''Doina'' through other television broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Viziteu, "Argument", in Ioan Constantinescu, Cornelia Viziteu (eds.), ''Studii eminescologice'', p. 5. Cluj-Napoca: Editura Clusium, 1999.  {{ISBN|973-555-214-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Doina'' was again standard reading for seventh-grade students, a matter which, according to journalist Sorin Șerb, contributes to their cultural isolation: "The Romanian schoolchild doesn't live on Earth, in an universe filled with wonder, but within the borders of a 'national, sovereign, independent, unitary and indivisible state'".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Sorin Șerb, [http://revista22online.ro/10794/.html "Cine bântuie școlile?"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Issue 1111, June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, ''Doina'' was featured on [[Romanian Orthodox icons]], by a [[Comănești]] priest calling for Eminescu's canonization,&lt;ref&gt;Both, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; and also reclaimed by Iron Guard revivalists.&lt;ref name="zodoctr"/&gt; It was then controversially sourced by the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic]] politician, [[Nicolae Bacalbașa]], during the [[Romanian presidential election, 2014|presidential race of 2014]], read as an attack on [[Klaus Iohannis]] (who is a [[Transylvanian Saxons|Transylvanian Saxon]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ovidiu Albu, [http://evz.ro/lider-psd-klaus-iohannis-reprezinta-interese-straine-cine-o-indragi-strainii-manca-i-ar-inima-cainii.html "Lider PSD: Klaus Iohannis reprezintă interese străine.

Eminescu is also revered in the post-Soviet [[Republic of Moldova]], where he has a status equivalent to that of "national poet", within [[Controversy over ethnic and linguistic identity in Moldova|the larger debate about Moldovan identity]]. This status is seen by scholar Wim van Meurs as "artificial" and "completely false", in particular because it has to override his Greater Romanian nationalism, "expressed in the first lines of his poem ''Doina''".&lt;ref&gt;Wim van Meurs, ''The Bessarabian Question in Communist Historiography'', pp. 324–325. Boulder: East European Monographs, 1994.  {{ISBN|0-88033-284-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the "[[Moldovenism|Moldovenist]]" side of the debate, the issue was brought up in the 1990s by author [[Ion Druță]], who suggested that both Eminescu and ''Doina'' are not representative for the Moldovan ethos, which, he argues, relies on other elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Maria Șleahtițchi, [https://web.archive.org/web/20170808113223/http://www.contrafort.md/old/2002/95-96/417.html "În reflector: Ion Druță. Publicistica lui Ion Druță sub semnul manipulării"], in ''[[Contrafort]]'', Nr. 9–10/2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Ioana Both noted that ''Doina'' was instrumented as a slogan by the [[Unification of Romania and Moldova|Moldova–Romania unionist movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Both, pp. 36, 46&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 2016, historian [[Robert D. Kaplan]] suggested that its first line continues to be quoted, "with its misty inoperable longing for a Greater Romania."&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; ''La arme'', in the Caudella version, was also recovered as an anthem by Moldovan unionists in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="lc10"/&gt; This issue was highlighted in November 1993, just before [[Great Union Day|Romania's national holiday]], when a [[Parliament of the Republic of Moldova|Moldovan Supreme Soviet]] delegate recited ''Doina'' in [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]]. The ambassadors of Hungary and Ukraine left the hall in protest, sparking a debate that also involved intellectuals on either side.&lt;ref name="tcsspec"&gt;{{ro icon}} Tudor Cristea, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150601024116/http://www.bibliotheca.ro/reviste/litere/nr_3_2006/litere_nr_3_2006.php "Spectacolul tranziției fără sfârșit"], in ''Litere'', Nr. 3/2006&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the Hungarian teacher Lajos Ötvös wrote a piece giving contextual justification for ''Doina''{{'}}s rhetoric.&lt;ref name="tcsspec"/&gt; In parallel, ''Doina'' continues to be of interest to Eminescu translators in other neighboring countries, with a Ukrainian version completed by Ivan Kideshuk.&lt;ref&gt;Antofiychuk, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2495">An '''''ekkyklêma''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|k|s|ᵻ|ˈ|k|l|iː|m|ə}}; {{lang-el|εκκύκλημα}}; "roll-out machine") was a wheeled platform rolled out through a ''[[Skene (theatre)|skênê]]'' in [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek theatre]]. It was used to bring interior scenes out into the sight of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 30), Csapo and Slater (1994, 61, 270-273, 428), Davidson (2005, 201), Goldhill (2007, 9), Ley (2007, xiv-xv), and Rehm (1992, 37).&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient sources suggest that it may have been revolved or turned.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 30) and Csapo and Slater (1994, 270-273).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is mainly used in [[Tragedy|tragedies]] for revealing dead bodies, such as Hippolytus' dying body in the final scene of [[Euripides]]' [[Hippolytus (play)|play of the same name]], or the corpse of Eurydice draped over the household altar in [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 67).&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses include the revelation in Sophocles' ''[[Ajax (Sophocles)|Ajax]]'' of Ajax surrounded by the sheep he killed whilst under the delusion that they were Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 69).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ekkyklêma'' is also used in comedy to [[parody]] the tragic effect.  An example of this is in [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[Thesmophoriazusae]]'' when Agathon, portrayed as an [[effeminate]], is wheeled onstage on an ''ekkyklêma'' to enhance the comic absurdity of the scene.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12687">'''Encastellation''' (sometimes '''castellation''', which can also mean [[Battlement|crenellation]]) is the process whereby the [[Feudalism|feudal]] kingdoms of [[Europe]] became dotted with [[castle]]s, from which local lords could dominate the countryside of their fiefs and their neighbours', and from which kings could command even the far-off corners of their realms. The ubiquity of the castle is iconic of the [[Middle Ages]]. 

The process was rather quick once the castle, as a distinct type of fortress, was introduced. However, it took different forms in different lands. The methods and reasons of encastellation differed based on law (who could legally build a castle), necessity (who needed a castle), and geography (where could castles be effectively built). The stone castle originated probably in the north of [[France]] in the tenth century. Older wooden castles, of the [[Motte-and-bailey castle|motte-and-bailey]] variety are probably older, though they were far more common until well into the twelfth century.

==France==
In France, encastellation began in the north, in [[Normandy]] and [[Anjou]], under the direction both of local barons as well as the [[Duke of Normandy]] and the [[Counts and dukes of Anjou|Count of Anjou]]. Most of these castles were of the motte-and-bailey type, which could be constructed with ease in a few months. Stone castles, however, were built before the end of the tenth century in Anjou.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, p ?.&lt;/ref&gt; These were originally nothing more than towers, [[Keep|donjons]] (from whence [[dungeon]]) or keeps. The reason for this proliferation was to provide oneself with protection in times of war, primarily as a place of refuge, but also as a strategic headquarters: a place from which to sally forth to raid and plunder before retreating to safety (again, the castle). For example, in Normandy:
{{cquote|Because [Hugh of Abbeville's peers] were not all lords of castles, [he] became more powerful than the rest of his peers. For he could do what he liked without fear, relying on the protection of the castle, while others, if they tried anything, were easily overcome as they had no refuge.&lt;ref&gt;Hariulf.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From Normandy and Anjou, encastellation spread to the [[Loire Valley]]. In [[Poitou]], there were thirty nine castles by the eleventh century, the constructions primarily of local magnates. Fortification had briskly increased in Gaul during the [[Viking Age]] (see [[Edict of Pistres]]) and this merely continued apace while the [[Carolingian dynasty]] declined in importance and regional control devolved to regional lords. 

In [[Languedoc]] and the south of France, there were more serious attempts, the [[Peace and Truce of God]] movements, to curb feudal warfare. But with the spread of heresy came the spread of castles as fortresses to which heretic barons could flee, such as the "five sons of Carcassonne."

==Italy==
In Italy, the process of encastellation is known as ''incastellamento''. It has a specific notion, as the ''incastellamento'' describes less the building of castles than the change towards fortified settlements, in which the castle proper (''rocca'') is a separate part. The term 'incastellamento' for this process was coined by [[Pierre Toubert]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Toubert: Les structures du Latium médiéval. Le Latium méridional et la Sabine du 9e siècle à la fin du 12e siècle, Rom 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; As in France, it was a different process in the north and the south. 

In the north, the castles were originally the seats of the barons. They spread quickly after the disruption of royal authority in Italy in the mid-tenth century. By the eleventh century, the territorial magnates, like the [[List of rulers of Tuscany|margrave of Tuscany]], were supreme and castles dotted the landscape. With the rise of the city-states after the collapse of Tuscan power in the early twelfth century, the powerful merchant families began to construct fortress and towers as residences in the cities. Well-preserved [[San Gimignano]] was the result of the struggle between [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]]. 

In the centre of the peninsula, the [[Papal States]], the agents of encastellation were not large territorial magnates, but the petty nobles who belonged to various families and factions usually associated with [[Rome]] in some way. The [[Crescentii]] and the [[Counts of Tusculum|Tusculani]] constructed fortresses throughout [[Latium]] to dominate the roads leading to the Eternal City and the Vatican. During the papal nadir of the tenth and eleventh centuries, their hilltop fortresses gave these minor lords far more power than their territories would otherwise permit. In Rome itself, encastellation often led to the fortifying of the ancient monuments which had fallen into disuses, such as the [[Arch of Constantine]] and the [[Colosseum]]. These fortresses were usually in the hands of one of the powerful lay families, but sometimes of the popes. 

In the [[Southern Italy|Mezzogiorno]], the independent principalities of the [[Lombards]] and the Greek city-states, which distanced themselves from any central authority, formed an opportune place for the proliferation of castles. Indeed, the nominally Byzantine duchies of [[Gaeta]], [[Naples]], and [[Amalfi]] grew around what were originally small coastal fortresses. The decline of ducal authority in these places has been blamed on the tendency to give outlying regions to younger sons (e.g. [[Docibilis II of Gaeta]] granting [[Fondi]] to [[Marinus II of Gaeta|Marinus]]), who then built their own fortresses and thus became independent in fact. Historian G. A. Loud considers ''incastellamento'' as one of the chief reasons for the decline in princely influence in Benevento and Capua (especially the former) during the late tenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Loud, p 481.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Barbara Kreutz notes the encastellation of the monastic estates which dominated south Italian politics and contributed to the constant confiscation and invasion of monastic estates as lay barons sought to increase their power against their foes during the war-filled eleventh and twelfth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Kreutz, pp 134-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of the [[Normans]], adept castle-builders, in the early eleventh century only exacerbated the tendency toward fortification of every hilltop. Together with the [[List of Princes of Salerno|Prince of Salerno]], they subdued [[Calabria]] and encastellated its mountainous territory, leading to the inevitable invasion of [[Sicily]].

==Spain==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The encastellation of Spain is inextricably linked to the [[Reconquista]]. That said, encastellation occurred mostly in the centre of the peninsula. This region, originally a county of the [[Kingdom of León]], even adopted the name [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] because of its many castles. The castles first began to spread quickly in the tenth century, in light of the increasing power of the Castilian counts ''vis-à-vis'' the king. During the long reign of Count [[Fernán González of Castile|Fernán González]], Castile became ''de facto'' independent and its castles multiplied.

==Britain==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
True medieval castles were a somewhat later arrival in Britain than in continental Europe. The process of encastellation in Britain is as inextricably linked to [[Normans|Normanisation]] (which is, of course, linked to the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]]) as the encastellation of Spain is to the Reconquista.

===England===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Normanisation began in England before the Conquest primarily through the Norman sojourn of [[Æthelred the Unready|Ethelred II]] and the influence of his Norman queen [[Emma of Normandy|Emma]]. During the reign of [[Edward the Confessor]] (1042&amp;ndash;1066), definite strides were taken in spreading Norman ideas to England. Castles were first built in England in his reign under the direction especially of his Norman [[marcher lord]] [[Ralph the Timid]]. 

Encastellation began in earnest under [[William the Conqueror]] in the years immediately following the [[Battle of Hastings]]. Castles of the motte-and-bailey were erected quickly all over the country to subdue the locals and prevent foreign invasions by rival claimants to the throne. Within a matter of years, England was fully castled. Most of these castles belonged to the king or one of his tenants-in-chief. The construction of numerous castles by minor lords was a feature, as in most places, of the reign of weaker kings. After the iron hand of William's sons had passed, [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen]] took the throne and [[the Anarchy]] (1135&amp;ndash;1152) of civil war which characterised his reign saw the proliferation of [[Adulterine castle|adulterine]] (unauthorised) castles: to the number of 1,115, according to one chronicler.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

===Wales===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The [[Welsh Marches]] had been encastellated from an early date, beginning even before the Conquest. However, the proliferation of castles in Wales dates only from [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|its English conquest]], though a few stone castles date from the reign of [[Llywelyn the Great]]. 

Motte-and-bailey castles existed from before the thirteenth century in those parts of Wales which fell under English authority and they spread in south Wales after its conquest, but the most famous encastellation of Wales occurred in the north under [[Edward I of England]] (1272&amp;ndash;1307). His famous Edwardian [[concentric castle]]s, large stoneworks with multiple rings of defences, grew up at strategic locations throughout the north and the local populace was placed securely under English authority. In this case, encastellation was the result, not of weak central authority, but of a strong royal hand and direction.

===Scotland===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
In [[Scotland]], the spread of castles came with the Normans who, in the twelfth century, began constructing castles of the motte-and-bailey type in the south, where they received royal support, especially in [[Galloway]]. At about the same time, the first stone castles appeared in the north, in [[Orkney]], built not by Normans but by the [[Vikings|Norse]].

===Ireland===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
In [[Ireland]], as in the rest of Britain and most of Europe, encastellation was primarily a Norman venture. The first castles were motte-and-baileys built on the expanding frontier of the [[The Pale|English Pale]] and within it to control the local population, according to [[Gerald of Wales]]. Stone castles were slow to develop, appearing in the late thirteenth century.

==Germany==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
As in France, so in Germany: the impetus for encastellation was provided, not by a strong monarch, but by the weakening of royal authority. During the eleventh-century [[Investiture Controversy]] in Germany and the resulting decline of the royal power, castle-building exploded as local warlords staked claims to formerly royal prerogatives in their petty states. 

In [[Prussia]], during the [[Drang nach Osten]] and the [[Northern Crusades]] of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, encastellation was the result of the [[List of rulers of Brandenburg|Margraves of Brandenburg]] and the [[Teutonic Knights]], who, among others, conquered the land from the pagan [[Old Prussians|Prussians]]. The construction of castles to control territories occurred at a late point in the development of the castle and these fortresses were large and complex. They were called ''[[Ordensburg]]en'' and they served as headquarters and training grounds for initiates into the knightly orders.

Founded in 2006 by its Executive Director Josette Melchor and Board Chairman Peter Hirshberg, Gray Area joins similarly focused institutions, like [[Eyebeam Art and Technology Center]] and [[Ars Electronica]], in promoting the intersections of art, technology and community by working to produce, exhibit, and develop the creative technical skills that allow for experimentation with and exploration of the most contemporary technologies.

==History==
Following a conversation in 2006 about the lack of proper venues for the exhibition of new media and technology based art work, Melchor and Hirshberg initially opened ''Gray Area Gallery'' in San Francisco's [[South of Market, San Francisco|South of Market (SoMa)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=forward/slash: The Gray Area Foundation for the Arts Story | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ulwcLVzT7w | year=2009 | accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Mid-Market Street Monitor | title=Examiner on Mid-Market Street revival | url=http://www.midmarketstreet.com/2009/07/examiner-on-mid-market-street-revival.html | year=2009 | accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, the gallery incorporated as a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] and was renamed ''Gray Area Foundation for The Arts''. In June 2009, Gray Area relocated to its present facility near the end of Taylor Street . In total, the {{convert|8000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} location had included in addition to the pornography arcade, a bar (Club 65) and liquor store. Leased from property owner Jack Sumski, the space allowed Gray Area to expand its well-established exhibition platform to include artist residencies, educational workshops and symposiums, growing Gray Area into the comprehensive and integrated center for the creation and promotion of technology-based art it is today.

===Partnerships and projects===
Gray Area Foundation for The Arts has partnered with [[MIT Senseable City Lab]] to produce a multi-faceted series of community initiatives and symposiums called ''Senseable Cities Speaker Series''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Gray Area | title=Senseable Cities Speaker Series | url= http://grayarea.org/initiative/senseable-cities-speaker-series/ | year=2010 | accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''City Centered Festival'' brought together artists, educators and community leaders within the Tenderloin district to generate ideas of using 'locative media' to better understand and connect in their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=City Centered website | url=http://citycentered.org/ | year=2010 | accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Syzygryd'' is a collaboration with three other arts organizations (Interpretive Arson, False Profit Labs &amp; Ardent Heavy Industries), to create a large scale interactive art piece to be unveiled at the 2010 [[Burning Man]] event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Syzygryd.com | url=http://www.syzygryd.com/ | year=2010 | accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artist residency===
The first five resident artists ''(Alphonzo Solorzano, Gabriel Dunne, Ryan Alexander, Miles Stemper and Daniel Massey)'' moved into the space in July 2009. In 2010, three of these resident artists remained. ''(Gabriel Dunne, Ryan Alexander and Daniel Massey)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Gray Area | title=Artists | url=http://grayarea.org/community-category/artists/ | year=2010 | accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jasad''''' ("body" in Arabic) is an [[Arabic language|Arabic-language]] cultural magazine based in [[Beirut]], specializing in the literature, art and science of the body. It was founded by [[Joumana Haddad]].

==History and profile==
Founded in 2008, the first issue of ''Jasad'' appeared in December of that same year,&lt;ref name=zab/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lebanese magazine champions sex and the city|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/03/30/69535.html|accessdate=13 October 2013|work=Al Arabiya|date=2 November 2010|agency=AFP|location=Beirut}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has raised a great deal of controversy ever since, because it tackles subjects that are taboo in the Arabic language and societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/13/lebanon-middleeast-magazine-taboo|accessdate=22 December 2008|title=From Voyeur's Corner to My First Time: new magazine attempts to lift veil on Arab taboos|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Ian|last=Black|date=13 December 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the March 2009 issue the magazine included articles about sexuality in the Arab world.&lt;ref name=zab&gt;{{cite news|title=Jasad magazine casts an unprecedented spotlight on sexuality in the Arab world|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Arts/Mar/31/Jasad-magazine-casts-an-unprecedented-spotlight-on-sexuality-in-the-Arab-world.ashx#axzz2g1cYANxV|accessdate=26 September 2013|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=31 March 2009|author=Jocelyne Zablit|agency=AFP}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Jasad'' is published by "Al Joumana". It is mainly in print, but small excerpts from each new issue are made available on its website. The founder, editor and publisher of the magazine is Lebanese poet and journalist [[Joumana Haddad]] who is also culture editor of ''[[An Nahar]]'' daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/12/AR2009051203465.html|accessdate=12 September 2009|work=[[The Washington Post]]|author=Alia Ibrahim|date=13 May 2009|title=Beirut's 'Body' Language Pioneer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dobrina Zhekova|title=Joumana Haddad on the Fate of the Arab World's First Erotic Literary Magazine|url=http://www.elle.com/news/culture/joumana-haddad-interview-on-womens-rights-jasad|accessdate=30 August 2014|work=Elle|date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jasad'' is distributed to readers worldwide through bookshops and/or by rapid courier via a yearly subscription system. It is a glossy magazine, 200 pages, sized 22 x 28&amp;nbsp;cm, and consists of different sections and columns, ranging from reportages, testimonies and articles, to essays, translations and creative writings, all covering the fields of cinema, literature, arts, theater, philosophy, science, revolving around the axis of the body.&lt;ref name=llc&gt;{{cite news|title=In Lebanon, 'Jasad' Magazine Defies Taboos|url=http://researchandmedia.ning.com/profiles/blogs/in-lebanon-jasad-magazine|accessdate=13 October 2013|work=Research and Media Network|date=16 March 2009|author=Lynette Lee Corporal|location=Bangkok}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saseen Kawzally regarded the magazine on 2 February 2009 as "very confusing" and as covering varied material that is not "entirely coherent".&lt;ref name=llc/&gt;

'''Kongo ivories''' are some of the finest sculptural works produced by the people of the west-central Africa's Lower Congo region. In the [[Kongo Kingdom]], [[ivory]] was a precious commodity that was strictly controlled by chiefs and kings, who commissioned sculptors to produce fine ivory sculptures for their personal and courtly use. With the rise of the [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic trade]], ivory became one of the most valuable African [[natural resources]] sought by Western industry. Eventually, Kongo ivory carvers produced works not only for indigenous leaders and elites but also for Europeans and other foreigners.&lt;ref name="Met Museum"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bridges|first=Nichole N.|title=Kongo Ivories|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kong/hd_kong.htm|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Afro-Portuguese ivories==
Most of the earliest extant ivory carvings from sub-Saharan Africa were not made for African consumers.&lt;ref name="Ross 1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Doran|title=Elephant : the animal and its ivory in African culture|year=1992|publisher=Fowler Museum of Cultural History, University of California|location=Los Angeles|isbn=0930741250|authorlink=Imagining Elephants: An Overview|editor=Doran Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Richly decorated oliphants, or side-blown horns, from the sixteenth century are among the earliest known of the Kongo Kingdom's royal commissions in ivory. Although made in the form of musical instruments to be used during court ceremonies, many such sculptures were likely given as gifts and made for sale to Portuguese elites, missionaries, and traders.&lt;ref name="Met Museum" /&gt; In the 1950s, historian [[William Buller Fagg|William Fagg]] coined the term “Afro-Portuguese ivories” to describe Kongo oliphants and other ivory sculptures from this period.&lt;ref name="Fagg 1958"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fagg|first=William|title=Afro-Portuguese Ivories|year=1958|publisher=Batchworth Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emma George Ross, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/apiv/hd_apiv.htm "Afro-Portuguese Ivories"] ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; A significant number of Afro-Portuguese ivories are in the [[British Museum]], many of them made in [[Sierra Leone]] and Benin in the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=Carved+ivory+Sierra+Leone British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=Carved+salt-cellar+Benin British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carved ivories for export==
About the middle of the nineteenth century, a new style of ivory carving developed in the area to meet the demand of the export trade along the [[Loango Kingdom|Loango Coast]] of west-central Africa. This style consisted of fine, detailed relief carving that depicts scenes of Kongo life.&lt;ref name=Siegmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Siegmann|first=William C.|title=African art a century at the Brooklyn Museum|year=2009|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=9780872731639}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes commonly portrayed in relief on the ivories capture the dynamic and cosmopolitan coastal activity related to the transatlantic trade.

Most carved Loango tusks are not longer than two to three feet because they were sourced from forest elephants, which are much smaller than the African savannah elephant. Full Loango tusk sculptures that were sculpted from the enormous tusks of savannah elephants are extremely rare; one notable example is now part of the [[Brooklyn Museum]]’s collection.

'''mTropolis''' (pronounced "metropolis") was an [[open-architecture]] multimedia programming application aimed at enabling rapid development of [[multimedia]] titles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000823023742/http://www.cbd-hq.com/articles/2000/000501gh_mtropolis.asp mTropolis, the Greatest CBD Tool that Never Was] by Glen Hunter, Mojo Productions Inc. (2000, archived)&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by mFactory (pronounced "em-factory") and introduced in 1995. It introduced [[object-oriented]] concepts such as reusable objects, modifiers and behaviors into the multimedia authoring space dominated by [[Macromedia]]'s Director software. mTropolis was bought in 1997 by [[Quark, Inc.|Quark]], which moved development from [[Burlingame, California]] to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] and then [[End-of-life (product)|cancelled the product]] one year later. Despite efforts by its fervent users to attempt to save their investment and beloved tool, negotiations and even a possible purchase offer never came to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindsay |first=Greg |title=The software that refused to die |url=http://salon.com/21st/feature/1998/06/10feature.html |accessdate=2016-06-27 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000503164742/http://salon.com/21st/feature/1998/06/10feature.html |archivedate=May 3, 2000|publisher=[[salon.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

mTropolis (pronounced "metropolis") competed in the [[Interactive media|interactive]] multimedia product space dominated in the 1990s by [[Adobe Director|Macromedia Director]]. The software's maker, mFactory (pronounced "em-factory"), founded in 1992, variously positioned mTropolis as an alternative and as an adjunct to Director.

mTropolis was bought by [[Quark, Inc.|Quark]] in 1997. The use of behaviors in mTropolis spurred [[Macromedia]] on to introduce behaviors in Director 6.0.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I was there when Seery, Shepherd, meself and probably Greggy went over to the Mtrop user meetings.  We straight out stole [behaviors] from  
them.

- ''Alex Zavatone (ex Macromedia) on the Direct-L Mailing List, Tue, 9 Sep 2008''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While multimedia CD-ROM authoring has largely been rendered irrelevant by online content distribution, mTropolis remains an interesting study in application design, and held a loyal following for many years.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Paradigm==

The development environment was very different from the other tools around at the time - [[Apple Computer]]'s [[HyperCard]] and others had a card based metaphor, and [[Macromedia Director]] had a film metaphor (the content area is called The Stage, the time line The Score, an assets library named The Cast, etc.). In mTropolis there were sections, subsections, and scenes. Assets would be placed onto the scene, and then combinations of behaviors and modifiers would be dragged onto the assets.

Powerful interaction and animation could be created by making different modifiers send messages to each other, allowing a user to create something impressive fairly quickly, without any typing. There was a simple programming language, accessed via a Miniscript modifier, but most of the programming was achieved by attaching standard behaviors and modifiers, and making selections within the modifier pop-up menus.

==Technical Issues==

According to [[Starship Titanic]] author [[Douglas Adams]], his team had originally selected mTropolis 1.0 for its development platform but it had to be abandoned for unspecified technical insufficiencies in favor of an in-house tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Adams | first = Douglas | title = Why isn't Starship Titanic on the Macintosh? | url=http://www.starshiptitanic.com/game/mac.html | accessdate = 2008-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miniscript Limitations===

One criticism of the tool was that the integrated programming language, Miniscript, was lacking key features necessary for common tasks. Because mTropolis was conceived around a [[visual programming language|visual programming]] metaphor, mFactory engineers intentionally omitted [[control flow|control constructs]] such as [[conditional loop]]s. To remedy such limitations, the third-party developer AX Logic produced the commercially-available Alien Studio modifier as a drop-in replacement for Miniscript.

===File Format===

The advent in version 1.1 of the mTropolis browser plug-in for [[Netscape Navigator]], dubbed ''mPire,'' exposed a core architectural shortcoming. The binary file format was not cross-platform; in order to make a mTropolis element available for embedding on a web page, the author was required to save a Macintosh version and a separate Windows version. Hence the web server had to store redundant copies of the same content, consuming disk space and necessitating the use of loader pages to serve the file appropriate for the end user's operating system.

===Macintosh-Only Authoring===

While playback engines existed for both the Macintosh and Windows platforms, the mTropolis authoring system itself only ran on the Mac.

==Release history==
===mTropolis 1.0===

January 1995: Released at [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo|MacWorld San Francisco]]. Retail price $4,495.

===mTropolis 1.1===

May 1996: Added support for [[QuickTime VR]] 1.0. Retail price $1,195.

October 1996: mFactory releases beta 1 of the mPire browser plug-in.

===mTropolis 2.0===

March 1997: mFactory announces pre-order sales availability for version 2.0, due to ship in "the second half of May." Retail price $995.

May 1997: Quark, Inc. purchases mFactory.

March 1998: Quark announces that v2.0 would be furnished free-of-charge to registered mTropolis v1 customers, but that the product will not be made available for general purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Landwehr | first = Rebecca | title = mFactory shut down by Quark | url=http://denver.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/1998/03/30/story5.html | accessdate = 2008-06-01 | date=1998-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Titles Created with mTropolis==

Due to the way the mTropolis Player was separate from developer content, by viewing the files, it is easy to tell if a title was developed with mTropolis. A few [[CD-ROM]]s were created using mTropolis, including the [[BAFTA]] award winning [[MindGym]], [[Scott Kim]]'s [[Obsidian (1997 video game)|Obsidian]], A Sharp's [[King of Dragon Pass]], the [[Muppets]] Treasure Island, Voyager's Fun With Architecture and The Magic World of [[Beatrix Potter]].

'''Mary, Untier of Knots''' or '''Mary, Undoer of Knots''' is the name of both a [[Marian devotions|Marian devotion]] and a [[Baroque]] painting ([[German language|German]]: ''Wallfahrtsbild'' or ''Gnadenbild'') which represents that devotion. The painting by [[Johann Georg Melchior Schmidtner]], of around&amp;nbsp;1700, is in the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[pilgrimage church]] of [[St. Peter am Perlach|St.&amp;nbsp;Peter am Perlach]], otherwise known as the Perlach church, in [[Augsburg]], [[Bavaria]], Germany. [[Pope Francis]] saw the image while in Germany as a student and promoted her veneration in Latin America.

==Painting==
The painting, executed in the Baroque style by Johann Georg Melchior Schmidtner (1625-1707), shows the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] standing on the crescent moon (the usual way of depicting Mary under her title of the [[Immaculate Conception]]), surrounded by angels and with the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] in the form of a [[dove]] hovering above her [[circle of stars]] as she unties knots into a long strip and at the same time rests her foot on the head of a "knotted" snake. The serpent represents the [[devil]], and her treatment of him fulfills the prophecy in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]&amp;nbsp;3:15: "I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."&lt;ref&gt;Douay-Rheims Bible, 1899 Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are shown a human figure and his dog accompanying a much smaller angel. This scene is often interpreted as [[Tobias]] with his dog and the [[Archangel]] [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]] traveling to ask Sara to be his wife.&lt;ref name=dayton&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Devotion to Mary, Untier of Knots|url=http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/resources/MaryUntierKnots/UntierKnots.html|work=A Dictionary of Mary|author=Richard Lenar|publisher=University of Dayton|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Mary untying knots is derived from a work by St.&amp;nbsp;[[Irenaeus]] of Lyons, ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'' (''Against Heresies''). In Book&amp;nbsp;III, Chapter&amp;nbsp;22, he presents a parallel between [[Eve]] and Mary, describing how "the knot of Eve's disobedience was loosed by the obedience of Mary. For what the virgin Eve had bound fast through unbelief, this did the virgin Mary set free through faith."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103322.htm Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III, 22]&lt;/ref&gt;

The two small figures have also been interpreted as a representation of Wolfgang Langenmantel, the grandfather of the benefactor, guided in his distress by a [[guardian angel]] to Father [[Jakob Rem]] in [[Ingolstadt]].&lt;ref name=dayton /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Augsburg-Perlachkirche.jpg|thumb|160px|[[St. Peter am Perlach|St. Peter’s Church]] with the [[Perlachturm|Perlach-Tower]]]]
The painting was donated around 1700 by Hieronymus Ambrosius Langenmantel (1641-1718),&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [[:de:Hieronymus Ambrosius Langenmantel|“Hieronymus Ambrosius Langenmantel”]], ''Wikipedia:  Die freie Enzyklopädie''. Retrieved 16 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of the [[Monastery]] of [[Saint Peter]] in Augsburg. The donation is said to be connected with an event in his family.  His grandfather Wolfgang Langenmantel (1586-1637) was on the verge of the separation from his wife Sophia Rentz (1590-1649) and therefore sought help from Jakob Rem, the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest in Ingolstadt. Father Rem prayed to the Blessed Virgin Mary and said: "''In diesem religiösen Akt erhebe ich das Band der Ehe, löse alle Knoten und glätte es'' [In this religious act, I raise the bonds of matrimony, to untie all knots and smoothen them]".  Immediately peace was restored between the husband and wife, and the separation did not happen.  In the memory of this event, their grandson commissioned the painting of the "Untier of Knots".

==Devotion==
The first Chapel to be named "Mary, Untier of Knots" was completed in 1989 in [[Styria]], Austria, inspired as a supplication in response to the [[Chernobyl]] Nuclear Tragedy.&lt;ref name=fraternity&gt;International Fraternity of the Virgin Mary Untier of Knots, "[http://www.desatadora.com.ar/xlista-i.htm List of Churches, Chapels and Places] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628192405/http://www.desatadora.com.ar/xlista-i.htm |date=28 June 2012 }} where the Virgin Mary, Untier of Knots is venerated [as] Maria Knotenlöserin".  Retrieved 16 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The image of "Mary, Undoer of Knots" is especially venerated in [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]],&lt;ref name=dayton /&gt; where churches have been named for her and devotion to her has become widespread and which the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' called a "religious craze".&lt;ref name=bellos&gt;{{cite news|last=Bellos|first=Alex|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/dec/24/alexbellos|title=Virgin painting ties Brazilians in knots|accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=The Guardian (UK)|date=23 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[Catholic devotions|Catholic devotion]] has grown since [[Pope Francis|Jorge Mario Bergoglio]], S.J. (who would later become Pope Francis, after a tenure as Archbishop of Buenos Aires), brought a postcard of the painting to Argentina in the 1980s after seeing the original while studying in Germany.&lt;ref name=chalice&gt;{{cite news|last=Jiménez |first=Pablo |title=The Pope's chalice: silver-made, austere and featuring Our Lady of Luján |url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/126383/the-popes-chalice-silvermade-austere-and-featuring-our-lady-of-luj%C3%A1n |accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=Buenos Aires Herald|date=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article114452124/Bergoglio-studierte-einst-in-Frankfurt-am-Main.html "''Bergoglio studierte einst in Frankfurt am Main'' &amp;#91;Bergoglio once studied in Frankfurt am Main"&amp;#93;] - (''[[Die Welt]]'', 14 March 2013, Online Edition).&lt;/ref&gt; The devotion reached Brazil near the end of the 20th century. According to Regina Novaes, of the Institute of Religious Studies in Rio de Janeiro, Mary, Untier of Knots "attracts people with small problems".&lt;ref name=bellos/&gt; Bergoglio had this image of Mary engraved on a chalice he presented to [[Pope Benedict XVI]] and another chalice bearing her image, the work of the same silversmith, is to be presented to Pope Francis on behalf of the Argentine people.&lt;ref name=chalice /&gt;

In Buenos Aires, a copy of the icon was made and left by the artist, Dr. Ana de Betta Berti,&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} {{de icon}} Falasca, Stefania.

On the 8th of each month, thousands of people make the pilgrimage to this church.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [https://www.facebook.com/notes/parroquia-san-jose-del-talar-y-santuario-de-la-virgen-que-desata-los-nudos/historia-del-cuadro-de-nuestra-se%C3%B1ora-que-desata-los-nudos/431014946921425 Facebook] of the parish of San José del Talar in Buenos Aires, with the photograph of the copy of the icon there.&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowing about Pope Francis' special devotion for this image, a new [[South Korea|South Korean]] ambassador in Vatican in 2018, Baek Man Lee, presented him with a Korean painting of Our Lady Undoer of Knots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New ambassador from Korea deeply honored to present credentials to Holy Father|url=https://www.romereports.com/en/2018/02/16/new-ambassador-from-korea-deeply-honored-to-present-credentials-to-holy-father/|accessdate=17 February 2018|publisher=RomeReports.com|date=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of 'music and emotion' seeks to understand the psychological relationship between human [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] and [[music]]. It is a branch of [[music psychology]] with numerous areas of study, including the nature of emotional reactions to music, how characteristics of the listener may determine which emotions are felt, and which components of a musical composition or performance may elicit certain reactions. The field draws upon and has significant implications for such areas as [[philosophy]], [[musicology]], [[music therapy]], [[music theory]] and [[aesthetics]], as well the acts of [[musical composition]] and [[performance]].
{{TOC limit}}

==Philosophical approaches==

===Appearance emotionalism ===
Two of the most influential philosophers in the aesthetics of music are [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]] and [[Jerrold Levinson]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/music/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, S. (2005). "Artistic Expression and the Hard Case of Pure Music", in: Kieran, M. (Ed.), ''Contemporary Debates in Aesthetics and the Philosophy of Art'': 179-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Davies calls his view of the expressiveness of emotions in music "appearance emotionalism", which holds that music expresses emotion without feeling it. Objects can convey emotion because their structures can contain certain characteristics that resemble emotional expression. "The resemblance that counts most for music's expressiveness ... is between music's temporally unfolding [[dynamic structure]] and configurations of human behaviour associated with the expression of emotion."&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2006, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The observer can note emotions from the listener's posture, gait, gestures, attitude, and comportment.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2006, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Associations between musical features and emotion differ among individuals. Appearance emotionalism claims many listeners' perceiving associations constitutes the expressiveness of music.  Which musical features are more commonly associated with which emotions is part of [[music psychology]].  Davies claims that expressiveness is an objective property of music and not subjective in the sense of being projected into the music by the listener. Music's expressiveness is certainly response-dependent, i.e. it is realized in the listener's judgement.  Skilled listeners very similarly attribute emotional expressiveness to a certain piece of music, thereby indicating according to Davies (2006) that the expressiveness of music is somewhat objective because if the music lacked expressiveness, then no expression could be projected into it as a reaction to the music.

===The process theory===
The philosopher Jenefer Robinson&lt;ref&gt;Jenefer Robinson, Deeper than Reason: Emotion and its Role in Literature, Music, and Art, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005; pp. 310-13&lt;/ref&gt; assumes the existence of a mutual dependence between cognition and elicitation in her description of 'emotions as process, music as process' theory (or 'process' theory). Robinson argues that the process of emotional elicitation begins with an 'automatic, immediate response that initiates motor and autonomic activity and prepares us for possible action' causing a process of cognition that may enable listeners to 'name' the felt emotion. This series of events continually exchanges with new, incoming information. Robinson argues that emotions may transform into one another, causing blends, conflicts, and ambiguities that make impede describing with one word the emotional state that one experiences at any given moment; instead, inner feelings are better thought of as the products of multiple emotional 'streams'. Robinson argues that music is a series of simultaneous processes, and that it therefore is an ideal medium for mirroring such more 'cognitive' aspects of emotion as musical themes' 'desiring' resolution or leitmotif's mirrors memory processes. These simultaneous musical processes can reinforce or conflict with each other and thus also express the way one emotion 'morphs into another over time'.

==Conveying emotion through music==
The ability to perceive emotion in music is said to develop early in childhood, and improve significantly throughout development.&lt;ref name=Foundations&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dowling|first=W. J.|title=The development of music perception and cognition|journal=Foundations of Cognitive Psychology: Core Reading|year=2002|pages=481–502}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity to perceive emotion in music is also subject to cultural influences, and both similarities and differences in emotion perception have been observed in cross-cultural studies.&lt;ref name="Susino and Schubert, 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Susino|first=M.|author2=Schubert, S.|title=Cross-cultural anger communication in music: Towards a stereotype theory of emotion in music|journal=Musicae Scientiae|year=2017|pages=60–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=William Forde |last2=Balkwill |first2=Laura-Lee |editor1-last=Juslin |editor1-first=Patrik |editor2-last=Sloboda |editor2-first=John |title=Handbook of Music and Emotion: Theory, Research, Applications |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2010 |pages=755–788 |chapter=Chapter 27: Cross-cultural similarities and differences | chapterurl=http://www.psy.mq.edu.au/me2/uploads/publications/27-Juslin__Sloboda-Ch-27.pdf|isbn=978-0-19-960496-8 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Empirical research has looked at which emotions can be conveyed as well as what structural factors in music help contribute to the perceived emotional expression. There are two schools of thought on how we interpret emotion in music. The [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivists']] approach argues that music simply displays an emotion, but does not allow for the personal experience of emotion in the listener. [[Emotivism|Emotivists]] argue that music elicits real emotional responses in the listener.&lt;ref name=Chapter16&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scherer|first=K. R.|author2=Zentner, M. R.|title=Emotional effects of music: production rules|journal=Music and Emotion: Theory and Research|year=2001|pages=361–387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Radford&gt;{{cite journal|last=Radford|first=C.|title=Emotions and music: A reply to the cognitivists|journal=The Journal of Aesthestics and Art Criticism|year=1989|volume=47|pages=69–76|jstor=431994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that the emotion experienced from a piece of music is a multiplicative function of  structural features, performance features, listener features and contextual features of the piece, shown as:

:''Experienced Emotion'' = ''Structural features'' × ''Performance features'' × ''Listener features'' × ''Contextual features''

where:

:''Structural features'' = Segmental features × Suprasegmental features
:''Performance features'' = Performer skill × Performer state
:''Listener features'' = Musical expertise × Stable disposition × Current motivation
:''Contextual features'' = Location × Event&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

===Structural features===
Structural features are divided into two parts, segmental features and suprasegmental features. Segmental features are the individual sounds or tones that make up the music; this includes acoustic structures such as [[Duration (music)|duration]], [[amplitude]], and [[pitch (music)|pitch]]. Suprasegmental features are the foundational structures of a piece, such as [[melody]], [[tempo]] and [[rhythm]].&lt;ref name="Chapter16" /&gt; There are a number of specific musical features that are highly associated with particular emotions.&lt;ref name="Chapter10"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gabrielle |first=A. |last2=Stromboli |first2=E. |title=The influence of musical structure on emotional expression |journal=Music and Emotion: Theory and Research |year=2001 |pages=223–243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the factors affecting emotional expression in music, [[tempo]] is typically regarded as the most important, but a number of other factors, such as [[mode (music)|mode]], [[loudness]], and [[melody]], also influence the emotional valence of the piece.&lt;ref name="Chapter10"/&gt;

|}

===Performance features===
Performance features refers to the manner in which a piece of music is executed by the performer(s). These are broken into two categories, performer skills and performer state. Performer skills are the compound ability and appearance of the performer; including physical appearance, reputation and technical skills. The performer state is the interpretation, motivation, and stage presence of the performer.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

=== Listener features ===
Listener features refers to the individual and social identity of the listener(s). This includes their personality, age, knowledge of music, and motivation to listen to the music.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

===Contextual features===
Contextual features are aspects of the performance such as the location and the particular occasion for the performance (i.e., funeral, wedding, dance).&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

These different factors influence expressed emotion at different magnitudes, and their effects are compounded by one another. Thus, experienced emotion is felt to a stronger degree if more factors are present. The order the factors are listed within the model denotes how much weight in the equation they carry. For this reason, the bulk of research has been done in structural features and listener features.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

====Conflicting cues====
Which emotion is perceived is dependent on the context of the piece of music. Past research has argued that opposing emotions like happiness and sadness fall on a bipolar scale, where both cannot be felt at the same time.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunter|first=P. G.|author2=Schellenburg, E. G. |author3=Schimmack, U. |title=Feelings and perceptions of happiness and sadness induced by music: Similarities, differences, and mixed emotions|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|year=2010|volume=4|pages=47–56|doi=10.1037/a0016873}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research has suggested that happiness and sadness are experienced separately, which implies that they can be felt concurrently.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt; One study investigated the latter possibility by having participants listen to computer-manipulated musical excerpts that have mixed cues between tempo and mode.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;   Examples of mix-cue music include a piece with major key and slow tempo, and a minor-chord piece with a fast tempo. Participants then rated the extent to which the piece conveyed happiness or sadness. The results indicated that mixed-cue music conveys both happiness and sadness; however, it remained unclear whether participants perceived happiness and sadness simultaneously or vacillated between these two emotions.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;   A follow up study was done to examine these possibilities. While listening to mixed or consistent cue music, participants pressed one button when the music conveyed happiness, and another button when it conveyed sadness.&lt;ref name=Larsen /&gt;  The results revealed that subjects pressed both buttons simultaneously during songs with conflicting cues.&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsen|first=J. T.|author2=Stastny, B. J.|title=It's a bittersweet symphony: Simultaneously mixed emotional responses to music with conflicting cues|journal=Emotion|year=2011|doi=10.1037/a0024081|volume=11|pages=1469–1473}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings indicate that listeners can perceive  both happiness and sadness concurrently.  This has significant implications for how the structural features influence emotion, because when a mix of structural cues is used, a number of emotions may be conveyed.&lt;ref name=Larsen /&gt;

===Specific listener features===

====Development====
Studies indicate that the ability to understand emotional messages in music starts early, and improves throughout child development.&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter4&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sloboda|first=J. A.|author2=Juslin, P. N.|title=Psychological perspectives on music and emotion|journal=Music and Emotion: Theory and Research|year=2001|pages=79–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies investigating music and emotion in children primarily play a musical excerpt for children and have them look at pictorial expressions of faces. These facial expressions display different emotions and children are asked to select the face that best matches the music's emotional tone.&lt;ref name=Nawrot&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nawrot|first=E. S.|title=The Perception of Emotional Expression in Music: Evidence from Infants, Children and Adults|journal=Psychology of Music|date=1 January 2003|volume=31|issue=1|pages=75–92|doi=10.1177/0305735603031001325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mote&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mote|first=Jasmine|title=The effects of tempo and familiarity on children's affective interpretation of music.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2011|volume=11|issue=3|pages=618–622|doi=10.1037/a0022573}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Terwogt&gt;{{cite journal|last=TERWOGT|first=MARK MEERUM|author2=VAN GRINSVEN, FLORA|title=RECOGNITION OF EMOTIONS IN MUSIC BY CHILDREN AND ADULTS|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|date=1 December 1988|volume=67|issue=3|pages=697–698|doi=10.2466/pms.1988.67.3.697}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that children are able to assign specific emotions to pieces of music; however, there is debate regarding the age at which this ability begins.&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt;

=====''Infants''=====
An infant is often exposed to a mother's speech that is musical in nature. It is possible that the motherly singing allows the mother to relay emotional messages to the infant.&lt;ref name=Trehub&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trehub|first+Sandra E.|author2=Nakata, Takayuki|title=Emotion and music in infancy|journal=Musicae Scientiae|year=2001|volume=SPEC ISSUE, 2001-2002|pages=37–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Infants also tend to prefer positive speech to neutral speech as well as happy music to negative music.&lt;ref name=Nawrot /&gt;&lt;ref name=Trehub /&gt; It has also been posited that listening to their mother's singing may play a role in identity formation.&lt;ref name=Trehub /&gt; This hypothesis is supported by a study that interviewed adults and asked them to describe musical experiences from their childhood. Findings showed that music was good for developing knowledge of emotions during childhood.&lt;ref name=Vist&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vist|first=Torill|title=Music Experience in Early Childhood: Potential for Emotion Knowledge?|journal=International Journal of Early Childhood|date=16 November 2011|volume=43|issue=3|pages=277–290|doi=10.1007/s13158-011-0045-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Pre-school children''=====
These studies have shown that children at the age of 4 are able to begin to distinguish between emotions found in musical excerpts in ways that are similar to adults.&lt;ref name=Nawrot /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mote /&gt; The ability to distinguish these musical emotions seems to increase with age until adulthood.&lt;ref name=Terwogt /&gt; However, children at the age of 3 were unable to make the distinction between emotions expressed in music through matching a facial expression with the type of emotion found in the music.&lt;ref name=Mote /&gt; Some emotions, such as anger and fear, were also found to be harder to distinguish within music.&lt;ref name=Terwogt /&gt;&lt;ref name=Robazza&gt;{{cite journal|last=ROBAZZA|first=CLAUDIO |author2=MACALUSO, CRISTINA |author3=D'URSO, VALENTINA|title=EMOTIONAL REACTIONS TO MUSIC BY GENDER, AGE, AND EXPERTISE|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|date=1 October 1994|volume=79|issue=2|pages=939–944|doi=10.2466/pms.1994.79.2.939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Elementary-age children''=====
In studies with four-year-olds and five-year-olds, they are asked to label musical excerpts with the affective labels "happy", "sad", "angry", and "afraid".&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;  Results in one study showed that four-year-olds did not perform above chance with the labels "sad" and "angry", and the five-year-olds did not perform above chance with the label "afraid".&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;  A follow-up study found conflicting results, where five-year-olds performed much like adults. However, all ages confused categorizing "angry" and "afraid".&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;
Pre-school and elementary-age children listened to twelve short melodies, each in either major or minor mode, and were instructed to choose between four pictures of faces: happy, contented, sad, and angry.&lt;ref name=Chapter10 /&gt; All the children, even as young as three years old, performed above chance in assigning positive faces with major mode and negative faces with minor mode.&lt;ref name=Chapter10 /&gt;

====Personality effects====
Different people perceive events differently based upon their individual characteristics. Similarly, the emotions elicited by listening to different types of music seem to be affected by factors such as personality and previous musical training.&lt;ref name=Ladinig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ladinig|first=Olivia|author2=Schellenberg, E. Glenn|title=Liking unfamiliar music: Effects of felt emotion and individual differences.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2012|volume=6|issue=2|pages=146–154|doi=10.1037/a0024671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schellenberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schellenberg|first=E. Glenn|author2=Mankarious, Monika|title=Music training and emotion comprehension in childhood.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2012|volume=12|issue=5|pages=887–891|doi=10.1037/a0027971|pmid=22642351}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vuoskoski Measure"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vuoskoski|first=J. K.|author2=Eerola, T.|title=Measuring music-induced emotion: A comparison of emotion models, personality biases, and intensity of experiences|journal=Musicae Scientiae|date=13 July 2011|volume=15|issue=2|pages=159–173|doi=10.1177/1029864911403367}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with the personality type of agreeableness have been found to have higher emotional responses to music in general. Stronger sad feelings have also been associated with people with personality types of agreeableness and neuroticism. While some studies have shown that musical training can be correlated with music that evoked mixed feelings&lt;ref name=Ladinig /&gt;  as well as higher IQ and test of emotional comprehension scores,&lt;ref name=Schellenberg /&gt; other studies refute the claim that musical training affects perception of emotion in music.&lt;ref name=Robazza /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kratus&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kratus|first=J.|title=A Developmental Study of Children's Interpretation of Emotion in Music|journal=Psychology of Music|date=1 January 1993|volume=21|issue=1|pages=3–19|doi=10.1177/030573569302100101}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also worth noting that previous exposure to music can affect later behavioral choices, schoolwork, and social interactions.&lt;ref name="Policy Statement"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Impact of Music, Music Lyrics, and Music Videos on Children and Youth|journal=Pediatrics|date=19 October 2009|volume=124|issue=5|pages=1488–1494|doi=10.1542/peds.2009-2145|pmid=19841124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, previous music exposure does seem to have an effect on the personality and emotions of a child later in their life, and would subsequently affect their ability to perceive as well as express emotions during exposure to music. Gender, however, has not been shown to lead to a difference in perception of emotions found in music.&lt;ref name=Robazza /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kratus /&gt;  Further research into which factors affect an individual's perception of emotion in music and the ability of the individual to have music-induced emotions are needed.

==Eliciting emotion through music==
Along with the research that music conveys an emotion to its listener(s), it has also been shown that music can produce emotion in the listener(s).&lt;ref name=Garrido&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garrido|first=S.|author2=E. Shubert|title=Individual differences in the enjoyment of negative emotion in music: a literature review and experiment|journal=Music Perception|year=2011|volume=28|pages=279–295|doi=10.1525/MP.2011.28.3.279}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view often causes debate because the emotion is produced within the listener, and is consequently hard to measure. In spite of controversy, studies have shown observable responses to elicited emotions, which reinforces the Emotivists' view that music does elicit real emotional responses.&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;&lt;ref name=Radford /&gt;

===Responses to elicited emotion===
The structural features of music not only help convey an emotional message to the listener, but also may create emotion in the listener.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  These emotions can be completely new feelings or may be an extension of previous emotional events. Empirical research has shown how listeners can absorb the piece's expression as their own emotion, as well as invoke a unique response based on their personal experiences.&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt;

====''Basic emotions''====
In research on eliciting emotion, participants report personally feeling a certain emotion in response to hearing a musical piece.&lt;ref name=Garrido /&gt; Researchers have investigated whether the same structures that conveyed a particular emotion could elicit it as well. The researchers presented excerpts of fast tempo, major mode music and slow tempo, minor tone music to participants; these musical structures were chosen because they are known to convey happiness and sadness respectively.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;  Participants rated their own emotions with elevated levels of happiness after listening to music with structures that convey happiness and elevated sadness after music with structures that convey sadness.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;  This evidence suggests that the same structures that convey emotions in music can also elicit those same emotions in the listener.

In light of this finding, there has been particular controversy about music eliciting negative emotions. [[Cognitivism (psychology)|Cognitivists]] argue that choosing to listen to music that elicits negative emotions like sadness would be paradoxical, as listeners would not willingly strive to induce sadness.&lt;ref name=Radford /&gt;  However, [[Emotivism|emotivists]] purport that music does elicit negative emotions, and listeners knowingly choose to listen in order to feel sadness in an impersonal way, similar to a viewer's desire to watch a tragic film.&lt;ref name=Radford /&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrido /&gt; The reasons why people sometimes listen to sad music when feeling sad has been explored by means of interviewing people about their motivations for doing so. As a result of this research it has indeed been found that people sometimes listen to sad music when feeling sad to intensify feelings of sadness. Other reasons for listening to sad music when feeling sad were; in order to retrieve memories, to feel closer to other people, for [[cognitive reappraisal]], to feel befriended by the music, to distract oneself, and for mood enhancement.&lt;ref name="Van den Tol"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van den TOl|first=A.J.M.|author2=Edwards, J.|title=Exploring a rationale for choosing to listen to sad music when feeling sad. |journal=Psychology of Music|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Researchers have also found an effect between one's familiarity with a piece of music and the emotions it elicits.&lt;ref name=Ali&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ali|first=S. O.|author2=Peynircioglu, Z. F.|title=Intensity of emotions conveyed and elicited by familiar and unfamiliar music|journal=Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal|year=2010|volume=27|pages=177–182|jstor=10.1525/mp.2010.27.3.177|doi=10.1525/MP.2010.27.3.177}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one study, half of participants were played twelve random musical excerpts one time, and rated their emotions after each piece. The other half of the participants listened to twelve random excerpts five times, and started their ratings on the third repetition. Findings showed that participants who listened to the excerpts five times rated their emotions with higher intensity than the participants who listened to them only once.&lt;ref name=Ali /&gt; This suggests that familiarity with a piece of music increases the emotions experienced by the listener.

====''Emotional memories and actions''====
Music may not only elicit new emotions, but connect listeners with other emotional sources.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  Music serves as a powerful cue to recall emotional memories back into awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Van den Tol, A. J. M., &amp;  Ritchie, T. D.(book-chapter in press). Emotion memory and music: A critical review and recommendations for future research.Music, Memory and Autobiography. (Eds: Professor Strollo Maria Rosaria and Dr. Romano Alessandra).&lt;/ref&gt; Because music is such a pervasive part of social life, present in weddings, funerals and religious ceremonies, it brings back emotional memories that are often already associated with it.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt;  Music is also processed by the lower, sensory levels of the brain, making it impervious to later memory distortions. Therefore creating a strong connection between emotion and music within memory makes it easier to recall one when prompted by the other.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt; Music can also tap into empathy, inducing emotions that are assumed to be felt by the performer or composer. Listeners can become sad because they recognize that those emotions must have been felt by the composer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van | first1 =  | last2 = den Tol | first2 = A. J. M. | last3 = Edwards | first3 = J. | year = 2013 | title = Exploring a rationale for choosing to listen to sad music when feeling sad | url = | journal = Psychology of Music | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 440–465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van | first1 =  | last2 = den Tol | first2 = A.

Listeners may also respond to emotional music through action.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt; Throughout history music was composed to inspire people into specific action - to march, dance, sing or fight. Consequently, heightening the emotions in all these events.  In fact, many people report being unable to sit still when certain rhythms are played, in some cases even engaging in subliminal actions when physical manifestations should be suppressed.&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt; Examples of this can be seen in young children's spontaneous outbursts into motion upon hearing music, or exuberant expressions shown at concerts.&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt;

====Juslin &amp; Västfjäll's BRECVEM model====

Juslin &amp; Västfjäll&lt;ref&gt;Patrik Juslin &amp; Daniel V ̈astfj ̈all, 'Emotional responses to music: The need to consider underlying mechanisms, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 31, 2008; 559-621.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juslin, Liljeström, Västfjäll, &amp; Lundqvist. (2010). How does music evoke emotions? Exploring the underlying mechanisms. In P.N. Juslin &amp; J. Sloboda (Eds.), ''Handbook of Music and Emotion: Theory, Research, and Applications'' (pp. 605-642). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; developed a model of seven ways in which music can elicit emotion, called the BRECVEM model.

''Brain Stem Reflex'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by music because one or more fundamental acoustical characteristics of the music are taken by the brain stem to signal a potentially important and urgent event. All other things being equal, sounds that are sudden, loud, dissonant, or feature fast temporal patterns induce arousal or feelings of unpleasantness in listeners...Such responses reflect the impact of auditory sensations – music as sound in the most basic sense.'

''Rhythmic Entrainment'':&lt;ref&gt;Juslin, P. (2011). Music and Emotion: seven questions, seven answers. In I. Deliège, J. Davidson, J. A. Sloboda (Eds.), ''Music and the Mind: Essays in Honour of John Sloboda'' (pp.113-138). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is evoked by a piece of music because a powerful, external rhythm in the music influences some internal bodily rhythm of the listener (e.g. heart rate), such that the latter rhythm adjusts toward and eventually 'locks in' to a common periodicity. The adjusted heart rate can then spread to other components of emotion such as feeling, through proprioceptive feedback. This may produce an increased level of arousal in the listener.'

''Evaluative Conditioning'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by a piece of music simply because this stimulus has been paired repeatedly with other positive or negative stimuli. Thus, for instance, a particular piece of music may have occurred repeatedly together in time with a specific event that always made you happy (e.g., meeting your best friend). Over time, through repeated pairings, the music will eventually come to evoke happiness even in the absence of the friendly interaction.'

''Emotional Contagion'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by a piece of music because the listener perceives the emotional expression of the music, and then "mimics" this expression internally, which by means of either peripheral feedback from muscles, or a more direct activation of the relevant emotional representations in the brain, leads to an induction of the same emotion.'

''Visual Imagery'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because he or she conjures up visual images (e.g., of a beautiful landscape) while listening to the music.'

''Episodic memory'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because the music evokes a memory of a particular event in the listener's life. This is sometimes referred to as the "Darling, they are playing our tune" phenomenon.'&lt;ref&gt;Davies, J. B. (1978). The psychology of music. Hutchinson.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Musical expectancy'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because a specific feature of the music violates, delays, or confirms the listener's expectations about the continuation of the music.'

====Musical expectancy====

With regards to violations of expectation in music several interesting results have been found. It has for example been found that listening to unconventional music may sometimes cause a meaning threat and result in compensatory behaviour in order to restore meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maher | first1 = P | last2 = Van Tilburg | first2 = W. A. P. | last3 = Van | first3 =  | last4 = den Tol | first4 = A. J. M. | year = 2013 | title = Meaning in music: Deviations from expectation in music polarize in-group and out-group attitudes | url = | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume =  34| issue = | pages =  155–172| doi = 10.1002/ejsp.196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aesthetic Judgement and BRECVEMA====

In 2013, Juslin created an additional aspect to the BRECVEM model called aesthetic judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Juslin | first1 = P. N. | year = 2013 | title = From everyday emotions to aesthetic emotions: towards a unified theory of musical emotions | url = | journal = Physics of Life Reviews | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 235–266 | doi=10.1016/j.plrev.2013.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the criteria which each individual has as a metric for music's aesthetic value. This can involve a number of varying personal preferences, such as the message conveyed, skill presented or novelty of style or idea.

==Comparison of conveyed and elicited emotions==

===Evidence for emotion in music===
There has been a bulk of evidence that listeners can identify specific emotions with certain types of music, but there has been less concrete evidence that music may elicit emotions.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  This is due to the fact that elicited emotion is subjective; and thus, it is difficult to find a valid criterion to study it.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  Elicited and conveyed emotion in music is usually understood from three types of evidence: self-report, physiological responses, and expressive behavior. Researchers use one or a combination of these methods to investigate emotional reactions to music.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

====''Self-report''====
The self-report method is a verbal report by the listener regarding what they are experiencing. This is the most widely used method for studying emotion and has shown that people identify emotions and personally experience emotions while listening to music.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  Research in the area has shown that listeners' emotional responses are highly consistent. In fact, a meta-analysis of 41 studies on music performance found that happiness, sadness, tenderness, threat, and anger were identified above chance by listeners.&lt;ref name=Vieillard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vieillard|first=S.|author2=Peretz, I. |author3=Gosselin, N. |author4=Khalfa, S. |title=Happy, sad, scary, and peaceful musical excerpts for research on emotions|journal=Cognition and Emotion|year=2008|volume=4|pages=720–752|doi=10.1080/02699930701503567}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study compared untrained listeners to musically trained listeners.&lt;ref name=Vieillard /&gt;  Both groups were required to categorize musical excerpts that conveyed similar emotions. The findings showed that the categorizations were not different between the trained and untrained; thus demonstrating that the untrained listeners are highly accurate in perceiving emotion.&lt;ref name=Vieillard /&gt; It is more difficult to find evidence for elicited emotion, as it depends solely on the subjective response of the listener. This leaves reporting vulnerable to self-report biases such as participants responding according to social prescriptions or responding as they think the experimenter wants them to.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  As a result, the validity of the self-report method is often questioned, and consequently researchers are reluctant to draw definitive conclusions solely from these reports.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

====''Physiological responses''====
Emotions are known to create physiological, or bodily, changes in a person, which can be tested experimentally. Some evidence shows one of these changes is within the nervous system.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;   Arousing music is related to increased heart rate and muscle tension; calming music is connected to decreased heart rate and muscle tension, and increased skin temperature.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt; Other research identifies outward physical responses such as shivers or goose bumps to be caused by changes in harmony and tears or lump-in-the-throat provoked by changes in melody.&lt;ref name=Chapter19&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gabrielsson|first=A.|title=Emotion in strong experiences with music|journal=Music and Emotion: Theory and Research|year=2001|pages=431–449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers test these responses through the use of instruments for physiological measurement, such as recording pulse rate.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

====''Expressive behavior''====
People are also known to show outward manifestations of their emotional states while listening to music. Studies using facial [[electromyography]] (EMG) have found that people react with subliminal facial expressions when listening to expressive music.&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt; In addition, music provides a stimulus for expressive behavior in many social contexts, such as concerts, dances, and ceremonies.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt; Although these expressive behaviors can be measured experimentally, there have been very few controlled studies observing this behavior.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

===Strength of effects===
Within the comparison between elicited and conveyed emotions, researchers have examined the relationship between these two types of responses to music. In general, research agrees that feeling and perception ratings are highly correlated, but not identical.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;  More specifically, studies are inconclusive as to whether one response has a stronger effect than the other, and in what ways these two responses relate.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ali /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kallenin /&gt;

====''Conveyed more than elicited''====
In one study, participants heard a random selection of 24 excerpts, displaying six types of emotions, five times in a row.&lt;ref name=Ali /&gt;  Half the participants described the emotions the music conveyed, and the other half responded with how the music made them feel. The results found that emotions conveyed by music were more intense than the emotions elicited by the same piece of music.&lt;ref name=Ali /&gt; Another study investigated under what specific conditions strong emotions were conveyed. Findings showed that ratings for conveyed emotions were higher in happy responses to music with consistent cues for happiness (i.e., fast tempo and major mode), for sad responses to music with consistent cues for sadness (i.e., slow tempo and minor mode,) and for sad responses in general.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt; These studies suggest that people can recognize the emotion displayed in music more readily than feeling it personally.

====''Sometimes conveyed, sometimes elicited''====
Another study that had 32 participants listen to twelve musical pieces and found that the strength of perceived and elicited emotions were dependent on the structures of the piece of music.&lt;ref name=Kallenin /&gt;  Perceived emotions were stronger than felt emotions when listeners rated for arousal and positive and negative activation. On the other hand, elicited emotions were stronger than perceived emotions when rating for pleasantness.&lt;ref name=Kallenin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kallenin|first=K|author2=Ravaja, N.|title=Emotion perceived and emotion felt: Same and different|journal=Musicae Scientaie|year=2006|volume=10|pages=191–213|doi=10.1177/102986490601000203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Elicited more than conveyed''====
In another study analysis revealed that emotional responses were stronger than the listeners' perceptions of emotions.&lt;ref name=Kallenin /&gt;  This study used a between-subjects design, where 20 listeners judged to what extent they perceived four emotions: happy, sad, peaceful, and scared. A separate 19 listeners rated to what extent they experienced each of these emotions. The findings showed that all music stimuli elicited specific emotions for the group of participants rating elicited emotion, while music stimuli only occasionally conveyed emotion to the participants in the group identifying which emotions the music conveyed.&lt;ref name=Kallenin /&gt; 
Based on these inconsistent findings, there is much research left to be done in order to determine how conveyed and elicited emotions are similar and different. There is disagreement about whether music induces 'true' emotions or if the emotions reported as felt in studies are instead just participants stating the emotions found in the music they are listening to.&lt;ref name=Schubert&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schubert|first=Emery|title=Locus of emotion: The effect of task order and age on emotion perceived and emotion felt in response to music|journal=Journal of Music Therapy|year=2007|volume=44|issue=4|pages=344–368|doi=10.1093/jmt/44.4.344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zentner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zentner|first=Marcel|author2=Grandjean, Didier |author3=Scherer, Klaus R. |title=Emotions evoked by the sound of music: Characterization, classification, and measurement.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2008|volume=8|issue=4|pages=494–521|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.8.4.494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music as a therapeutic tool==
{{Main|Music therapy}}
Music therapy as a therapeutic tool has been shown to be an effective treatment for various ailments. Therapeutic techniques involve eliciting emotions by listening to music, composing music or lyrics and performing music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keen MSocSc | first1 = Alexander W. | year = 2005 | title = Using Music as a Therapy Tool to Motivate Troubled Adolescents | url = | journal = Social Work in Health Care | volume = 39 | issue = 3–4| pages = 361–373 | doi = 10.1300/J010v39n03_09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Music therapy sessions may have the ability to help drug users who are attempting to break a drug habit, with users reporting feeling better able to feel emotions without the aid of drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = Felicity A. | last2 = Gleadhill | first2 = Libby M. | last3 = Dingle | first3 = Genevieve A. | year = 2007 | title = Music therapy and emotional exploration: Exposing substance abuse clients to the experiences of non-drug-induced emotions | url = | journal = The Arts in Psychotherapy | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 321–330 | doi=10.1016/j.aip.2007.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music therapy may also be a viable option for people experiencing extended stays in a hospital due to illness. In one study, music therapy provided child oncology patients with enhanced environmental support elements and elicited more engaging behaviors from the child.&lt;ref name=Robb&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robb|first=Sheri L.|title=The effect of therapeutic music interventions on the behavior of hospitalized children in isolation: Developing a contextual support model of music therapy|journal=Journal of Music Therapy|year=2000|volume=37|issue=2|pages=118–146|doi=10.1093/jmt/37.2.118}}&lt;/ref&gt; When treating troubled teenagers, a study by Keen revealed that music therapy has allowed therapists to interact with teenagers with less resistance, thus facilitating self-expression in the teenager.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
 
Music therapy has also shown great promise in individuals with autism, serving as an emotional outlet for these patients. While other avenues of emotional expression and understanding may be difficult for people with autism, music may provide those with limited understanding of socio-emotional cues a way of accessing emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heaton | first1 = Pam | year = 2009 | title = Music - shelter for the frazzled mind?". | url = | journal = The Psychologist | volume = 22 | issue = 12| pages = 1018–1020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Musical Party in a Hall''''' (c. 1663-1665) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Pieter de Hooch]]. It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the [[Museum der bildenden Künste]].

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1908, who wrote; "126. THE MUSIC-PARTY. deG. 34.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn01hofsuoft#page/569/mode/1up Comparative table] of catalog entries between John Smith's first [[Catalogue raisonné]] of Hooch and Hofstede de Groot's first list of Hooch paintings published in [[Oud Holland]]&lt;/ref&gt; On the left in a large hall, the left-hand portion of which is represented, sit three persons at a table covered with an Ispahan carpet, upon which are some oranges. One gentleman plays the cello, another the flute, while a lady sings. The flute-player sits on the extreme left behind the table, wearing a slouch hat. 
The cello-player sits to the right of the table, in full view of the spectator ; he has long curls, and wears knee-breeches and a pink doublet with slashed sleeves over a white shirt with broad cuffs. He raises a glass with his left hand and holds his bow with his right. He looks at the lady sitting at his right ; she has her music-book in her lap, and wears a greenish bodice and a yellow silk skirt. Between the two men is a boy, and behind him a couple. From the right comes a little dog. At the back of the hall a flight of stone steps goes up through a door. A second door on the right shows a well-lighted room, in which a young couple stand. Above these doors a copy of [[Raphael]]'s ''[[School of Athens]]'' is let into the wall.

According to Dr. [[Wilhelm von Bode|W. Bode]], the picture dates from about 1662 to 1665. Its canvas is 32 inches by 27 inches. Described by Ch. Blanc, Le Tresor de la Curiosite, ii. 262. 
Owners of the painting include Pierre de Grand Pre, Paris, February 16, 1809 (bought for 2620 -francs, Paillet), James, London, 1892 (Thieme), and its in the collection of the [[Alfred Thieme|A. Thieme]] at Leipzig, No. 45 in the 1900 catalogue&lt;ref&gt; see the introduction by Dr. W. Bode, p. 32, [https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn01hofsuoft#page/510/mode/1up entry 126 for ''The Music-Party''] in Hofstede de Groot, 1908&lt;/ref&gt;

The large hall, the left-hand portion of the painting, is a gallery of the main hall of the (then) Amsterdam City Hall, today the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]]. The painting at the back is a fantasized version of the ''School of Athens'' by Raphael, but in reality another painting was installed. The gallery is possibly the one in the southeast corner near the registry office for weddings, as there are three couples represented. Possibly the doorway on the right is meant to be the registry office itself.

De Hooch made at least two more paintings with scenes of the interior of the Amsterdam City Hall:

[[File:Nathdwara srinathji.jpg|thumb|Nathdwara Srinathji|126x126px]]

'''Nathdwara Painting''' refers to a painting tradition and school of artists that emerged in [[Nathdwara]], a town in [[Rajsamand]] district in the Western state of [[Rajasthan]] in India. Nathdwara paintings are of different sub-styles of which ''[[Pichhwai]]'' paintings are the most popular.&lt;ref name=et02&gt;{{cite news|title=Temple of Doodh|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2002-08-15/news/27361138_1_temple-management-kar-seva-nathdwara|accessdate=14 January 2012|newspaper=''[[The Economic Times|Economic Times]]''|date=15 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''Pichwai'' derives from the [[Sanskrit]] words ''pich'' meaning back and ''wais'' meaning hanging. These paintings are cloth paintings hung behind the image of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Shrinathji]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt; http://artofpast.com/gallery/pichwai-of-gopies/ &lt;/ref&gt; Link is dead --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Origin and area==
The Nathdwara school is a subset of the [[Mewar]] school of painting and is seen as an important school in the 17th and 18th century [[Manuscript miniature|miniature paintings]]. The sub-styles of Mewar painting include Udaigarh, Devgarh and Nathdwara as important centers of miniature production. The temple of Shrinathji is believed to have provided a boost to the art activities in the town. It is recorded that to avoid the oppression of the [[Iconoclasm|iconoclast]] [[Mughal emperor]] [[Aurangzeb]], the image of Shrinathji, a child manifestation of [[Krishna]] was installed in Nathdwara in 1670 by Goswami priests from [[Mathura]]. After this, many artists, including the famous Acharya Gopinathji, motivated by religious fervor came and created paintings of Srinathji.&lt;ref name=toi08&gt;{{cite news|title=Celebrating Nathdwara paintings|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-11-30/ahmedabad/27892936_1_mughal-sect-aurangzeb|accessdate=14 January 2012|newspaper=''[[Times of India]]''|date=30 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pichhwai are intricate paintings which portray Lord Krishna. They exist in the holy town of Nathdwara in the Rajasthan state of India.

Krishna is shown in different moods, body postures, and attire more commonly found on a cloth or paper. It is a very ancient form of art passed on from generation to generation and it has a very devotional theme towards Lord Krishna.

The purpose of Pichhwais, other than its artistic appeal, is to narrate tales of Krishna to the illiterate. They have become the main export of Nathdwara and are in much demand among foreign visitors in the area.

These artists mostly live in Chitron ki gali (Street of paintings) and Chitrakaron ka mohallah (colony of painters) and make a close community with constant interaction. It is no wonder that many times a Pichhwai painting is a group effort, where several skillful painters work together under the supervision of a master artist.

==Themes==
[[File:Sri nathji.jpg|thumb|103x103px|Srinathji.]]
Most works produced in this style revolve around the figure of Shrinathji as a manifestation of [[Krishna]] and refer to the incident of him holding the [[Govardhan hill]] on his last finger. Each ''pichwai'' painting is considered a ''seva'' or an offering to the deity and hence personifies Shrinathji as a prince with jewels and luxuries, surrounded by the milkmaids, [[gopi]]s. These ''seva'' themes are based on different seasons and paintings are made to depict different moods of the season.&lt;ref name="workworship"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2005/08/21/stories/2005082100170200.htm |title=Work is worship |last=Kapur|first=Mita|date=21 August 2005|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also paintings that show the Lord in different costumes celebrating different festivals. Other themes like Mata Yashoda, Nandlal and Balgopal figures are also painted in this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PGjTjmL29VIC | title=Splendour of Rajasthani Painting | first1=Jai Singh | last1=Neeraj | first2=Jayasiṃha | last2=Nīraja | publisher=Abhinav Publications | year=1991 | isbn=9788170172673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the paintings are gem-encrusted.&lt;ref name="ht10"&gt;{{cite news |title=Weaving art with charity|url=http://www.livemint.com/2010/08/20182353/Weaving-art-with-charity.html |newspaper=''[[Hindustan Times]]''|date=20 August 2010|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barrias Nature p1070171.jpg|thumb|A copy of ''Nature Unveiling Herself Before Science'' in [[gilding|gilt]] [[bronze]], polychromed [[marble]], and [[lapis lazuli]], from the [[Iris &amp; B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts]]]]

'''''Nature Unveiling Herself Before Science''''' ({{lang|fr|'''La Nature se dévoilant à la Science'''}}) is an [[allegorical sculpture]] created in 1899 in the [[Art Nouveau]] style by [[Louis-Ernest Barrias]]. The sculpture depicts a woman—[[personifying]] [[Mother Nature|Nature]]—removing a veil to reveal her face and bare breasts. The sculpture, which is in the [[Musée d'Orsay]], was commissioned for the [[Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers]].&lt;ref name="Objectivity"&gt;Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison, ''Objectivity''.  New York: Zone Books, 2007.  p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;  Underneath the veil, Nature wears a gown held up by a [[scarab (artifact)|scarab]].  The figure is made of marble, with the gown made of [[Algeria|Algerian]] [[onyx]], and the scarab of [[malachite]].  The sculpture has also been reproduced in other media.  

According to historians of science [[Lorraine Daston]] and [[Peter Galison]], the sculpture "blends the ancient trope of the [[veil of Isis]], interpreted as nature's desire to hide her secrets, with the modern fantasy of (female) nature willingly revealing herself to the (male) scientist, without violence or artifice."&lt;ref name="Objectivity"/&gt;  According to historian of science [[Carolyn Merchant]], the sculpture is emblematic of transformation of conceptions of nature that came with the [[Scientific Revolution]]: "From an active teacher and parent, she [Nature] has become a mindless, submissive body."&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Merchant, ''The Death of Nature: Women, Ecology, and the Scientific Revolution''.  New York: HarperOne, 1990.  pp. 189–190.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a similar vein, biologist and essayist [[Gerald Weissmann]] has noted the similarity between Nature's pose in Barrias' sculpture and that of the central figure in the 1876 painting ''[[Philippe Pinel|Dr. Pinel Unchaining the Mad]]'' by [[Tony Robert-Fleury]], a released inmate from an [[insane asylum]] who has "the detached look of the very lost."&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Weissmann, "The Doctor with Two Heads" (1988) in ''Darwin's Audubon: Science and the Liberal Imagination''.  Cambridge, MA: Perseus Publishing, 1998. p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;  Literary critic [[Elaine Showalter]] imagines a companion piece depicting Science would consist of "a fully clothed man, whose gaze [is] bold, direct, and keen, the penetrating gaze of intellectual and sexual mastery".&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Showalter, ''Sexual Anarchy: Gender and Culture at the Fin de Siècle''.  Virago Press Ltd, 1992.  p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two separated in 2012.

Though PHI and PHIUS [[sustainable design]] standards are different, they both share common goals for drastic [[energy conservation]] and carbon reduction through [[Sustainable architecture]] design techniques and specifications to create [[Low-energy house]]s and other structures with [[Low energy building]] practices for the public benefit worldwide.

'''''Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination''''' is a 1992 work of [[literary criticism]] by [[Toni Morrison]].

==History==
In 1990, Morrison delivered a series of three lectures at the [[Massey Lectures]] at [[Harvard University]]; she then adapted the texts to a 91-page book, ''Playing in the Dark'', published in 1992 by [[Harvard University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jimoh |first1=A Yemisi |title=Toni Morrison: Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=2769 |website=The Literary Encyclopedia |publisher=The Literary Dictionary Company Limited |accessdate= August 8, 2016 |date=July 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's three chapters are "Black Matters",&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Toni. [https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/black-matters-toni-morrison-is-the-new-nobel-laureate-for-literature-here-we-print-an-extract-from-1509384.html "Black matters: Toni Morrison is the new Nobel laureate for literature. Here, we print an extract from her writing on whiteness and the literary imagination"]. ''[[The Independent]]'', October 8, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; "Romancing the Shadow", and "Disturbing Nurses and the Kindness of Sharks".

==Subject matter==
Writing in ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]'', Linda Krumholz described Morrison's project as "reread[ing] the American literary canon through an analysis of whiteness to propose the ways that black people were used to establish American identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krumholz |first1=Linda |title=Review of Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination |journal=[[Signs (journal)|Signs]] |date= January 1, 1996 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=243–248 |jstor=3175058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing ''Playing in the Dark'' in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1992, Wendy Steiner said: "The moral and emotional force of [Morrison's] explorations is apparent. If the American identity is formed against this black shadow, it is a sign of abject weakness and a cause for shame....The genius of Ms. Morrison's approach is to enlist those very describers and imaginers—white men of letters—in an investigation that can end only in their self-indictment." But, Steiner added, "it is also not a mere denunciation of white culture. Instead, it is a self-help project meant both to map out new critical territory and to rearrange the territory within."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Steiner |first1=Wendy |title=The Clearest Eye |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/05/books/the-clearest-eye.html?pagewanted=all |accessdate= August 8, 2016 |work=The New York Times|date= April 5, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Eric Dyson]] observes that in addition to this exploration of the "white literary imagination...''Playing in the Dark'' is also about a black intellectual seizing the interpretive space within a racially ordered hierarchy of [[cultural criticism]]. Blacks are usually represented through the lens of white perception rather than the other way around...With [''Playing in the Dark''], a substantial change is portended."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i2KNkKojBHIC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181&amp;dq=%22impressive+debut+as+a+critical+intellectual%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3z93F_xiXn&amp;sig=QMbdwZqVUdrIwhSZaYvsqKk82v0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtrqPc87LOAhWH64MKHZA6Az4Q6AEIJTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22impressive%20debut%20as%20a%20critical%20intellectual%22&amp;f=false|title=Reflecting Black: African-American Cultural Criticism|date=1993|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816621439|page=181|language=en|last=Dyson|first=Michael Eric|accessdate= August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In 2016, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine noted that ''Playing in the Dark'' was among Morrison's most-assigned texts on U.S. college campuses, together with several of her novels and her 1993 [[Nobel Prize]] lecture, making her one of the most-assigned of all female writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Johnson |first1=David |title=These Are the 100 Most-Read Female Writers in College Classes |url=http://time.com/4234719/college-textbooks-female-writers/ |accessdate= August 8, 2016 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="706">A '''production write-through contract''' is an arrangement, specific to the [[film industry]], where a [[screenwriter]] enters into a commercial agreement with a studio that guarantees the screenwriter the right to do all the necessary rewrites to his or her screenplay.  The screenwriter will be on the set throughout the production of the film, and will do the rewrites that a [[production rewriter]] would otherwise do.&lt;ref&gt;A book about entertainment law is required as a proper source for this term.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Psychoanalysis''''' was a short-lived [[comic book]] published by [[EC Comics]] in 1955 the fifth title in its ''[[New Direction (comics)|New Direction]]'' line. The bi-monthly comic was published by [[William Gaines]] and edited by [[Al Feldstein]]. ''Psychoanalysis'' was approved by the [[Comics Code Authority]], but [[Newsagent's shop#United States|newsstand]]s were reluctant to display it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saunalahti.fi/karielk/kamehome.htm#psyco3|title=Jack Kamen's EC Cover Art|last=Elkelä|first=Kari|date=1/11/1998|accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lasted a total of four issues before being canceled along with EC's other ''New Direction'' comics.

==Characters and stories==
''Psychoanalysis'' was unlike practically any other comic published, focusing on [[psychoanalysis]] and the day-to-day work of therapists. The comic featured three patients; Freddy Carter, Ellen Lyman and Mark Stone, who were undergoing [[psychoanalysis]]. The analyst was the central character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politedissent.com/archives/2055|title=Psychoanalysis #4 (EC, 1955)|author=Scott|date=August 12, 2008|work=Polite Dissent|accessdate=20 November 2010|quote=As the name suggests, in ''Psychoanalysis'' the reader follows an unnamed pipe-smoking psychiatrist as he attempts to analyze and cure his patients.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was never named, simply listed as ''The Psychiatrist''. Ellen Lyman did not appear in the fourth and final issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/12377/|title=Psychoanalysis #4|work=[[Grand Comics Database]]|accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been cured in the third issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politedissent.com/archives/1731|title=Psychoanalysis #3 (EC, 1955)|author=Scott|date=August 20, 2007|work=Polite Dissent|accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reprints==
Between October 1999 and January 2000, publisher [[Russ Cochran (publisher)|Russ Cochran]] (in association with [[Gemstone Publishing]]) reprinted the four individual issues of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/11996/|title=Psychoanalysis #1|work=[[Grand Comics Database]]|accessdate=20 November 2010|quote=Reprinted: in Psychoanalysis (Gemstone, 1999 series) #1 (October 1999)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This complete run was later rebound, with covers included, in a single softcover ''[[Russ Cochran (publisher)#EC Annuals|EC Annual]]''.

==Adaptations==
The pages were reformatted as a [[daily strip|daily comic strip]], samples for possible syndication, but it was never picked up by a [[Comic strip syndication|syndicate]].

At the invitation of [[Steve Allen]], ''Psychoanalysis'' was adapted into two dramatic episodes which were telecast as part of the NBC ''[[Tonight Show|Tonight]]'' show. One script was by Feldstein, and the other was by Howard Rodman.&lt;ref&gt;''Variety'', 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rabindra Chitravali''''' is a 2011 four-volume set of books by art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]] that contains paintings of [[Rabindranth Tagore]]. These include about 1700 paintings in the Rabindra Bhavana and [[Kala Bhavana]] collections of [[Visva-Bharati]], [[Santiniketan]]; and more than 300 paintings in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Modern Art]] and the collections at Rabindra Bharati University, Kolkata; [[National Gallery of Modern Art]], New Delhi and Bangalore; and [[Indian Museum]], Kolkata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pratikshanbooks.com/booksonart/rabindra_chitravali.html |title= Pratikshan :: Rabindra Chitravali |publisher=Pratikshanbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hindustantimes1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/India/Tagore-paintings-glow-on-his-150th-birth-anniversary/Article1-541584.aspx |title=Tagore paintings glow on his 150th birth anniversary |publisher=''Hindustan Times'' |date=2010-05-10 |accessdate=2013-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421080810/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/India/Tagore-paintings-glow-on-his-150th-birth-anniversary/Article1-541584.aspx |archivedate=2013-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

'''Rio Grande Glaze Ware''' is a late prehistoric and historic pottery tradition of the [[Puebloan peoples]] of New Mexico. The tradition involved painting pots with black paint made with lead ore; as the pots were fired the black paint fused and sometimes ran. The tradition lasted from AD 1315 to 1700. Rio Grande Glaze Ware was made or used in a number of villages from the Santa Fe area to the north end of Elephant Butte Reservoir, and from the valley of the [[Rio Puerco (Rio Grande)|Rio Puerco]] east to the upper Pecos River Valley.

Archaeologists divide Rio Grande Glaze Ware into arbitrary types with much shorter life spans, primarily to help them date sites. Individual [[Sherd|potsherds]] are assigned to types based on a combination of attributes, beginning with vessel rim profiles and proceeding to painted designs or vice versa.

==Overview and cautions==

Rio Grande Glaze Ware was first made about AD 1315 (based on [[Dendrochronology|tree-ring]] dating at Tijeras Pueblo). It partly displaced an earlier tradition of [[Rio Grande white wares|black-on-white pottery]] and was inspired by the White Mountain Red Ware tradition (Carlson 1970) centered on the upper Little Colorado drainage of eastern Arizona and western New Mexico. The apparent ancestral type for Rio Grande Glaze Ware, Los Padillas Polychrome, was a local variant on a White Mountain Red Ware type, Heshotauthla Polychrome (Wilson 2005:43). Los Padillas is found at sites dominated by [[black-on-white]] decorated pottery (Mera 1935:33), a pattern predating the glazeware tradition, and Wilson (2005:43) dates Los Padillas from AD 1175 to 1300. Habicht-Mauche (1993, Table 2) dates it from AD 1300 to 1350, however. The type is sometimes called Los Padillas Glaze Polychrome.

Rio Grande Glaze Ware was fired in an oxygen rich atmosphere. The lead-based pigment yielded a black glazing paint despite the presence of oxygen, while iron-based, non-glazing pigment yielded a matte red paint. Red design elements were most often outlined in black. On most pots, background colors ranged from red to olive to yellow, achieved with clay slips containing iron. A white slip was sometimes achieved by using slip clay imported from the Acoma-Zuni region to the west.

Rio Grande Glaze Ware was no longer made after 1700, because the Spanish cut off Pueblo access to the lead ore used in making the glaze paint (Wilson 1995:10). The Pueblos continued to make polychrome pottery but used all matte paints (Harlow 1973), as they do today.

The ware was made in the [[Rio Grande]] Valley and adjacent valleys, from roughly Santa Fe south to the north end of Elephant Butte Reservoir, and from the Rio Puerco east and northeast to the upper Pecos River. Unlike Old World glazed pottery and its derivatives, Rio Grande Glaze Ware used the glaze material as part of a decorative scheme, never to coat and waterproof the entire vessel.

Spielmann (1998) argues that the new pottery was part of changing religious practices
among the New Mexico Pueblos, and specifically that "large glaze ware bowls were used ... for
communal feasting, with each household contributing to the feast. The smaller white ware bowls
continued to function as vessels for domestic food consumption. During the fifteenth century,
white ware bowls were replaced by a smaller form of the Rio Grande glaze ware bowl, and thus
glaze ware bowls came to be used in both ceremonial feasting (large size bowl) and domestic food
consumption (small size bowl)" (Spielmann 1998:258).

Archaeologists divide Rio Grande Glaze Ware into a number of [[Typology (archaeology)|types]], primarily to estimate the age of a site (based on what pottery types were found there). In this article the first approach to the named types begins with rim profiles. It is followed by a breakdown that begins with paint styles. Both approaches can be useful in understanding why a specific piece of pottery was assigned to a specific type. What follows is not an exhaustive typology (those can be found in the references provided). Rather, it is just extensive enough to allow non-specialists to understand the existing named distinctions.

==Approach based on rims==

The most time-sensitive attribute of Rio Grande Glaze Ware pottery is the rim profiles of bowls, so most archaeologists sort potsherds beginning with the rims. In doing so they refer to Glaze A through Glaze F pottery, A rims being the earliest and F rims being the latest (Hawley 1950; Wilson 2005). This letter-based key was first developed by Harry Percival Mera (1933), drawing on an earlier, number-based key developed by [[Anna O. Shepard]] and [[Alfred V. Kidder]] (Kidder and Shepard 1936). Here, the first question is: what rim profile is present?

===Glaze A===

[[Image:Rio grande a rims.GIF|thumb|upright|Profiles of Glaze A rims]]
Glaze A bowl rims are in-curving and of a consistent thickness. The lips are rounded or squared. Glaze A is often dated from AD 1315 to 1425 (Wilson 2005:47), but the end date applies only from the Albuquerque area north. In the southern part of the range, bowls with Glaze A rims were made until AD 1500 or later (Franklin 2007).

Glaze A pottery was first made in the Albuquerque area (the earliest directly dated examples being from Tijeras Pueblo) and was dominated by red-slipped examples with black interior designs. The exteriors are sometimes painted with isolated elements such as crosses. Pottery of this description is classified as Agua Fria Glaze-on-red. In some of the earliest examples, however, simple white paint designs appear on the exterior; such pottery is classified as Arenal Glaze Polychrome (with crushed rock temper) or Los Padillas Polychrome (with sherd temper) (Wilson 2005:47&amp;ndash;48).

As Glaze A pottery spread north, yellow-slipped examples appeared and are known as Cieneguilla Glaze-on-yellow. Yellow-slipped pottery with red matte paint elements outlined in black glaze paint are known as Cieneguilla Glaze Polychrome (Wilson 2005:49&amp;ndash;50).

On some Glaze A pottery, the interior slip color differs from the exterior slip color (so that the background colors are different on each side of a potsherd). If the painted design was executed with black glaze paint, the type is known as San Clemente Glaze Polychrome. If the design also includes red matte paint elements (usually outlined in black), the type is known as [[Pottery Mound]] Polychrome (Wilson 2005:51&amp;ndash;52).

Although most Glaze A rims were quite simple, one contemporary variant has a slightly flaring rim (Honea 1966).  Examples with one slip color are classified as Sanchez Glaze-on-red or Sanchez Glaze-on-yellow. Examples with contrasting white (interior) and red (exterior) slips, and with black glaze paint, are termed Sanchez Glaze Polychrome (Wilson 2005:52&amp;ndash;54).

===Glaze B===

&lt;!--Tried setting image to thumb, looked awful, reverted to fixed size--&gt;
[[Image:Rio grande b rim.GIF|thumbnail|right|100px|Profile of Glaze B rim]]
Glaze B bowl rims are also incurving but become thicker towards the lips, which are flat. The resulting profile is somewhat wedge-shaped. Glaze B was made almost exclusively in the region north of Albuquerque; farther south, potters simply continued with the Glaze A rim style. Glaze B dates between AD 1400 and 1450 (Wilson 2005:55).

Glaze B vessels with one slip and black glaze paint are classified as Largo Glaze-on-yellow or Largo Glaze-on-red, the yellow-slipped type being more common. Examples with one slip, and red matte paint outlined in black, are classified as Largo Glaze Polychrome. In this type, the lower portions of bowl exteriors are often unslipped (Wilson 2005:55&amp;ndash;57).

Rarely, examples are found with two contrasting (interior versus exterior) slip colors and black glaze paint designs; these are termed Medio Glaze Polychrome.

===Glaze C===

&lt;!--Tried setting image to thumb, looked awful, reverted to fixed size--&gt;
[[Image:Rio grande c rim.GIF|thumbnail|right|100px|Profile of Glaze C rim]]
Glaze C bowl rims have everted lips. Glaze C was made between AD 1425 and 1500. This rim group has one named type, Espinoso Glaze Polychrome, which includes red matte paint elements outlined in black glaze paint. The contrast between the red paint and the other colors give Espinoso pots a "gaudy" look. Jar necks are near-vertical and display red designs outlined in black. The bottom of vessel exteriors may be unslipped. In the Glaze C through E periods, vessel designs were almost exclusively polychrome (Wilson 2005:57).

===Glaze D===

&lt;!--Tried setting image to thumb, looked awful, reverted to fixed size--&gt;
[[Image:Rio grande d rims.GIF|thumbnail|right|100px|Profiles of Glaze D rims]]
Glaze D bowl rims date between AD 1470 and 1515. In profile, rim exteriors exhibit an inward bend (or close to it). The rims themselves are either fairly consistent in thickness, or taper slightly to both the body and the lip. This rim group has one named type, San Lazaro Glaze Polychrome, which includes red matte paint elements outlined in black glaze paint. Some examples lack the red matte paint but are also classified as San Lazaro. Bowl interiors and exteriors both have designs in panels or bands. The black paint is thin but non-runny (Wilson 2005:58).

===Glaze E===

&lt;!--Tried setting image to thumb, looked awful, reverted to fixed size--&gt;
[[Image:Rio grande e rims.GIF|thumbnail|right|120px|Profiles of Glaze E rims. L-R: Pecos, Puaray, Escondido]]
Most Glaze E bowl rims are substantially thicker than the bodies of the bowls, and "breaks" (discontinuities) in the exterior curve of the bowl are common. After the Spanish colonized New Mexico in 1598, some glaze ware bowls took on distinctly European shapes, for example, soup plates. Glaze E black paint ran during firing. Glaze E was made from 1515 until 1700 (Wilson 2005:59).

Glaze E bowl rims fall into three named categories. Puaray Glaze Polychrome is characterized by thickened rim profiles reminiscent of willow leaves, above a marked break in the exterior profile. The designs included red matte paint elements outlined runny black (or off-black) glaze. When the rims are instead somewhat rectangular in profile, the type becomes Escondido Glaze Polychrome. In the Pecos Pueblo area, Glaze E rims are sometimes instead somewhat "stubby," meaning that the break is near the rim, and that the thickened portion of the rim is correspondingly short. This variant is known as Pecos Glaze Polychrome (McKenna and Miles 1996; Wilson 2005:59&amp;ndash;61).

===Glaze F===

&lt;!--Tried setting image to thumb, looked awful, reverted to fixed size--&gt;
[[Image:Rio grande f rim.GIF|thumbnail|right|100px|Profile of Glaze F rim]]
"Glaze F ... exhibits a significant decline in the glaze and quality of workmanship" (Wilson 2005:62). Glaze F bowl rims retain a break in the exterior profile, but the marked thickening of Glaze E disappears. European-inspired shapes become more common. The glaze paint then in use usually fired to runny brown or green rather than black.

Glaze F vessels with one slip and "black" glaze paint are classified as Kotyiti Glaze-on-red or Kotyiti Glaze-on-yellow. Several design variants are subsumed by Kotyiti Glaze Polychrome. Some examples of that polychrome type have one slip color and red matte paint elements outlined in "black" glaze paint. Others have two slip colors and either "black" glaze paint examples or red-and-black paint examples (Wilson 2005:62).

==Approach based on paint styles==

Under the Mera system of classification, all types based on painting styles fit neatly as subtypes of the types based on rim forms. In practice, specific painting styles do not form neat subsets of groups defined on rim forms, particularly in the southern portion of the production range. Here, the first question is: does the painted design consist of black elements, or of red and black elements?

===Black painted designs===

The first examples of Rio Grande Glaze Ware carried on a centuries-old tradition of black painted designs on a lighter background. The next question is: was the slipped background (1) red, (2) yellow, or (3) contrasting colors, one on the inside of the vessel, the other on the outside?

====Red slip backgrounds====

[[File:Los Padillas Polychrome Bowl.gif|thumb|right|Los Padillas Polychrome bowl]]
Arenal Glaze Polychrome and Los Padillas Polychrome feature red-slipped bowls with simple interior designs painted in black glaze paint; the former has crushed rock temper while the latter has crushed sherd temper. The bowl exteriors include simple designs in white matte paint. The overall layout (black-on-red interiors, white-on-red exteriors) is a carryover from White Mountain Red Ware. Arenal dates from AD 1315 to 1350(?) and is found from Albuquerque south&amp;mdash;the same area of its supposed ancestor, Los Padillas Polychrome.

Agua Fria Glaze-on-red lacks white paint on bowl exteriors, but is otherwise identical to Arenal. Agua Fria bowls are red-slipped. The black glaze paint is usually dull and non-runny. The black designs are usually laid out in bands on the upper part of bowl interiors. The upper exteriors sometimes have slashes, crosses, or similar isolated motifs. Jars with black-on-red exterior designs also occur. Agua Fria Glaze-on-red occurs throughout the Rio Grande Glaze Ware area. It dates from AD 1315 to 1425 throughout its range, and later (possibly as late as 1550) in the southern portion of its range. Honea (1966) describes a variant of Agua Fria Glaze-on-red with a slightly out-flaring rim, Sanchez Glaze-on-red. This type is found north of Albuquerque and dates from AD 1350 to 1425.

[[File:Kotyiti Glaze Bowl.gif|thumb|right|Kotyiti Glaze-on-red bowl]]
When B rims rather than A rims are present, this type becomes Largo Glaze-on-red (AD 1400 to 1450). Afterwards, all-black painted designs appear to have given way to black-and-red painted designs until the Spanish Colonial period, when some vessels revert to this simpler design scheme. During the Spanish Colonial period, when F rims are present, this type becomes Kotyiti Glaze-on-Red (AD 1625 to 1700).

====Yellow slip backgrounds====

When the slip is more yellow than red, black-design vessels are called Cieneguilla Glaze-on-yellow. This style is found north of Albuquerque and may represent a local innovation as the making of glaze ware pottery spread northward. Cieneguilla dates from AD 1325 to 1425. In the [[Galisteo Basin]], a variant of this type with a slightly flaring lip is known as Sanchez Glaze-on-yellow (Honea 1966) and dates from AD 1350 to 1425.

When B rims rather than A Rims are present, black-on-yellow bowls are classified as "Largo Glaze-on-yellow." This type dates from AD 1400 to 1450. Afterwards, all-black painted designs appear to have died out until the Spanish Colonial period, when some vessels revert to this simpler design scheme. During the Spanish Colonial period, when F rims are present, the named type is Kotyiti Glaze-on-yellow (AD 1625 to 1700).

====Contrasting slip backgrounds====

Early on, potters also learned to make some vessels with contrasting slips&amp;mdash;one background color on the inside of the vessel, a different background color on the outside. The options included the red and yellow slip clays used on one-slip vessels, as well as white slip clay probably imported from the west.

San Clemente Glaze Polychrome dates from AD 1315 (?&amp;mdash;this is probably too early) to 1425. In this type, the interior and exterior of each bowl is slipped in a different color. (In jars, the uppermost and most easily reached part of the interior is slipped a different color.) The black glaze paint design applied over the slip often includes dots and serrated lines. San Clemente Polychrome occurs from Albuquerque south.

Honea (1966) has described a variant on San Clemente Glaze Polychrome, Sanchez Glaze Polychrome. The Sanchez variant has a "slightly out-flaring rim resembling Glaze C rims, but thicker" (Wilson 2005:54). This rare variant consists of bowls, which are found north of Albuquerque.

Late in the sequence, a variant appears in which black paint designs appear over contrasting interior and exterior slips, with Glaze F rims. This combination is called Kotyiti Glaze Polychrome, however, the same name is used for F rim examples with red-and-black painted designs (see below).

===Red and black painted designs===

Almost immediately, it seems, the Rio Grande area potters branched out from black-design tradition of White Mountain Red Ware, adding a scheme involving black and red paint designs on a lighter background. Where red (matte) paint was used, it was almost always outlined in black glaze paint. This specific artistic canon may have been inspired by Ramos Polychrome, a type of pottery made in northwest Chihuahua beginning about 1200. The next question is: was the slip background (1) a single color (which could vary), or (2) contrasting colors?

====Single background colors====

The use of red-and-black painted designs apparently began on vessels with yellow slips, but as time went on other slip colors were used. The probable first type in this tradition was Cieneguilla Glaze Polychrome, which differs from Cieneguilla Black-on-yellow by the addition of red (matte) paint elements outlined in black (glaze) paint. Cieneguilla Polychrome dates from AD 1325 to 1425. When B rims rather than A rims are present, this type becomes Largo Glaze Polychrome (AD 1400 to 1450).

When C rims are present, the type becomes Espinoso Glaze Polychrome (AD 1425 to 1500). By Espinoso, the slip tends to be off-white rather than yellow, causing the designs to appear more "gaudy." This background color may be in imitation of contemporary Acoma-Zuni wares. Espinoso Glaze Polychrome is most common north of Albuquerque.

When D rims are present, the type becomes San Lazaro Glaze Polychrome (AD 1470 to 1515). The background slip color reverted to a tan-reddish continuum. In some instances the red matte paint was not used, and strictly speaking those examples are glaze-on-red designs, not polychrome.

[[File:Puaray Glaze Polychrome.gif|thumb|Puaray Glaze Polychrome jar neck and upper shoulder]]
When E rims are present, the type becomes Puaray Glaze Polychrome (willow-leaf profiles; AD 1515 to 1650) or Escondido Glaze Polychrome (rectangular profiles; AD 1515 to 1650[?]). (Jars, such as the one shown, have different rims and are always classed as Puaray rather than as Escondido.) The background slip color ranges from an off-white to yellow or red. By this point the black glaze paint is "runny" (during firing), giving the finished vessels a sloppy look. It is not clear whether the runny look is deliberate (due to a change in the paint formula) or unavoidable (due to a change in the available raw minerals). In the area, a local variant, Pecos Glaze Polychrome, has "stubby" thickened rims; this variant dates from AD 1515 to 1700.

When F rims are present, the type becomes Kotyiti Glaze Polychrome (AD 1625 to 1700),  however, the same type name is applied to F rim examples in the San Lazaro (two slip) tradition. Kotyiti Glaze Polychrome is characterized by slapdash designs and by the use of runny glaze black paint.

====Contrasting background colors====

[[Image:Pottery Mound Polychrome Jar Sherd.gif|thumb|[[Pottery Mound]] Glaze Polychrome Jar Sherd]]
Pottery Mound Polychrome is considered a variant of San Clemente Glaze Polychrome, in the sense that the San Clemente slip scheme (different slip color on interiors and exteriors) is combined with the canon of red matte paint outlined in black glaze paint. In some of the most boldly executed examples of this type, however red matte paint designs are sometimes not framed in black. The background colors used in contrasting pairs include red (grading to orange), yellow (grading to olive), and white (probably using slip clay from the Acoma area, in imitation of Acoma-Zuni wares). Pottery Mound Polychrome dates from AD 1400 to 1490. The sole center of production was [[Pottery Mound]], a village on the lower Rio Puerco (east).

Eckert (2003, 2006) breaks this pottery into two types. She uses "Pottery Mound Polychrome" to describe A rim bowls slipped yellow to buff on the interior surface and red on the exterior surface, and dates the type from AD 1375 to 1450 or later. She uses "Hidden Mountain Polychrome" for A or C rim bowls are slipped red on the interior surface and white on the exterior surface, and dates the type from AD 1400 to 1450 or later. By her standards, the bowl sherd with a C rim shown here is Hidden Mountain Polychrome, not Pottery Mound Polychrome.

==Tabular approach to classification==

[[Image:Pottery mound glaze polychrome bowl sherd with C rim.gif|thumb|Pottery Mound Glaze Polychrome bowl sherd with C rim]]
The Mera system, which first keys off rim profiles, is probably best suited to the northern portion of the glaze ware production area&amp;mdash;in other words, in the area Mera relied on to develop his system. One recently developed alternative approach, by Franklin (2007), reflects work in the southern portion of the glaze ware area, where the Mera system works less well. Franklin's system recognizes the cross-cutting nature of rim forms and painted designs in the Rio Grande Glaze Ware. In his system, therefore, a bowl with black glaze paint on a red slip background is classified "Agua Fria Glaze-on-red" regardless of rim form, and the rim forms (A, B, etc.) are separately recorded for the sherds thus classified. One advantage of this approach is its flexibility. In Wilson (2005), for example, Pottery Mound Polychrome is listed as a Glaze A type but at the production center, [[Pottery Mound]], it occurs with other rim forms (Franklin 2007).

==Early years==
She was born in [[New Gloucester]], [[Maine]] on September 3, 1836.&lt;ref&gt;Plummer's gravestone indicates 1836 as her year of birth, although some accounts cite 1840. Matas, "Life Stories" (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  She was educated in Massachusetts at the [[Female College of Worcester]].&lt;ref name="findagrave"&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/21712917 "Sara Allen Plummer Lemmon (1836–1923)"], ''Find-a-Grave''.&lt;/ref&gt; Plummer then moved to [[New York City]], teaching art there for some years,&lt;ref name="redmon"&gt;Michael Redmon, [http://www.independent.com/news/2008/apr/10/who-responsible-setting-santa-barbaras-first-libra/ "Who is responsible for setting up Santa Barbara’s first library?"], ''Santa Barbara Independent'', April 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and studying at [[Cooper Union]].&lt;ref&gt;''Appletons' cyclopaedia of American biography'', Volume 7, edited by James Grant Wilson and John Fiske.&lt;/ref&gt; She also served as a nurse for a year or two during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name="findagrave" /&gt;

==Move to California==
[[File:SkyIslandPkwy.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Mount Lemmon]], [[Arizona]], named after Sara Lemmon]]
Falling ill in 1868–69, she moved to California in 1869, after hearing from her friend how the trip helped his health.&lt;ref name="redmon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://daily.jstor.org/sara-plummer-lemmon/|title=Sara Plummer Lemmon: Pioneering Botanist {{!}} JSTOR Daily|date=2015-03-11|newspaper=JSTOR Daily|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers of the day described Plummer as "one of the first 'intellectuals'" to move to Santa Barbara,&lt;ref&gt;Unspecified newspapers cited in Kimberly Matas, [http://azstarnet.com/news/local/article_cf80a43c-066c-53fb-9f51-48143c8401ad.html "Life stories: Mt. Lemmon's namesake was female explorer"], ''Arizona Daily Star'', Oct. 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in 1871&lt;ref name="findagrave" /&gt; she established a lending library that became an important cultural center for Santa Barbara.&lt;ref name="redmon" /&gt; Shortly after arriving in Santa Barbara, she established the "Lending Library  and Stationery Depot", with the aid of a friend, [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[Henry Whitney Bellows|Henry Bellows]], who helped her acquire her first few hundred volumes.&lt;ref name="redmon" /&gt; Operating out of a jewelry store on [[State Street, Santa Barbara|State Street]], Plummer charged $5 membership or 10 cents for borrowing books, and sold a variety of art and music supplies, and held cultural gatherings including lectures and art exhibits.&lt;ref name="redmon" /&gt;

While walking about [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], she acquired an interest in [[botany]], and turned her paintings towards [[botanical illustration]]s.&lt;ref name="redmon" /&gt; In 1876 Plummer met [[John Gill Lemmon|John Gill (J.G.) Lemmon]] (1831–1908) when he was giving a lecture in Santa Barbara.&lt;ref name="matas"&gt;Kimberly Matas, [http://azstarnet.com/news/local/article_cf80a43c-066c-53fb-9f51-48143c8401ad.html "Life stories: Mt. Lemmon's namesake was female explorer"], ''Arizona Daily Star'', Oct. 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Lemmon, a [[American Civil War|Civil War veteran]] and former [[Andersonville prison]]er, was, like Plummer, a self-trained botanist.&lt;ref name="matas" /&gt; The couple started corresponding via letters and Lemmon tutored her in botany. She also sent him a shrub she had found near Santa Barbara, and after a friend of his examined it, named it ''[[Baccharis plummerae]]'' in honor of her.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1880 they married, Plummer assuming his name.&lt;ref name="calbeat" /&gt; At that point, she sold her library to the [[Odd Fellows]] to operate, and she and John Lemmon began traveling and cataloging botanical materials.&lt;ref name="redmon" /&gt;

Lemmon and her husband John honeymooned in the [[Santa Catalina Mountains]] near [[Tucson, Arizona]] at her recommendation.&lt;ref name="miner"&gt;Carrie M. Miner, [http://www.arizonascenicroads.com/tucson/sky_island_article_4.html "Sara Plummer Lemmon"], ''Arizona Scenic Roads'' (last visited Aug. 24, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the aid of E. O. Stratton, they eventually scaled the tallest peak, which they named [[Mount Lemmon]] in her honor&lt;ref name="miner" /&gt; – one of the few mountains named for a woman.&lt;ref name="banks"&gt;Leo W. Banks, [http://friendly-village.org/skyisland.htm "Sky Island Parkway"] (last visited Aug. 24, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. O. Stratton, ''Pioneering in Arizona: The Reminiscences of Emerson Oliver Stratton and Edith Stratton Kitt''.

After returning from their trip, they continued their botanical endeavors. The Lemmons co-developed the [[Lemmon Herbarium]] at their home at No. 5985 [[Telegraph Avenue]],&lt;ref name="guinn"&gt;James Miller Guinn, ''History of the State of California and Biographical Record of Oakland and Environs'' (1907), Historic Record Company, pp.834–835. Available at [http://www.cagenweb.com/cpl/bios5.htm California Biographies] (last visited Aug. 24, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; later donating it to [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], where it was later merged into and called the [[University and Jepson Herbaria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/archon/?p=collections/controlcard&amp;id=92 "Biographical Information", John and Sara (Plummer) Lemmon Papers], University and Jepson Herbaria Archives, University of California, Berkeley (last visited Aug. 24, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  Lemmon continued her botanical illustrations, including as the official artist for the [[California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection|California State Board of Forestry]] (from 1888–1892)&lt;ref name="findagrave" /&gt; and acquired a national reputation for her work.&lt;ref name="redmon" /&gt; In 1882, she discovered a new genus of plants called ''[[Hymenoxys ambigens|Plummera floribunda]].'' In 1893, she lectured on forest conservation at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|World’s Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the 1890s she also advocated for the adoption of the [[golden poppy]] as the state flower of [[California]], eventually writing the bill passed by the California Legislature and signed in 1903.&lt;ref name="findagrave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="redmon" /&gt;

==Death==
Her husband J.G. died in 1908, and Sara Plummer Lemmon died in California in 1923. The couple is buried at [[Mountain View Cemetery (Oakland, California)|Mountain View Cemetery]] in Oakland, in Plot 46, with a poppy on her gravestone.&lt;ref name="calbeat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="findagrave" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4814">'''Single-channel video''' is [[video art]] work using a single electronic source and presented and exhibited from one playback device. Electronic sources can be any format of video tape, [[DVDs]] or computer-generated moving images utilizing the applicable playback device (such as a [[VCR]], DVD player or computer) and exhibited using a television monitor, projection or other screen-based device. Historically, video art was limited to unedited video tape footage displayed on a television monitor in a gallery and was contrasted with both broadcast television and film projections in theatres. As technology advanced, the ability to edit and display video art provided more variations and ''multi-channel video'' works became possible as did multi-channel and multi-layered video installations. However, single-channel video works continue to be produced for a variety of aesthetic and [[conceptual art|conceptual]] reasons and the term usually now refers to a single image on a monitor or projection, regardless of image source or production.

==History==
{{main article|video art}}

Artists began working with video technology in the 1960s. The earliest works used television sets as sculptural objects but by the late 1960s video recorders became readily available and artists began experimenting with the potential to record performances and conceptual works addressing the medium itself and critiquing broadcast television and commercial film.&lt;ref name="Horsfield"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wwew.vdb.org/sites/default/files/Kate%20Horsfield%20-%20Busting%20the%20Tube%3B%20A%20Brief%20History%20of%20Video%20Art.pdf |title=Busting the tube: A brief history of video art |last=Horsfield |first=Kate |date=2017-07-23 |year= |website=www.vdb.org |publisher=Video Data Bank}}, . "Busting the tube: A brief history of video art." Feedback: The Video Data Bank Catalogue of Video Art an Artist Interviews (2006): 7-17.&lt;/ref&gt; As more artists worked with video as a medium the problem of exhibition arose. Not being able to project the image as with film, the playback of video tapes was left to monitors placed in galleries and [[Artist-run space|alternative art spaces]]. Theoretically and commercially, the video tape created problems as tapes were easily duplicated, with no "original" (although a [[master recording|master]] did usually exist). Video cooperatives and distribution centres emerged following the [[experimental film]] model. Unlike film, however, the gallery became the primary venue for video art.&lt;ref name="Horsfield"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As multiple channels became possible, artists continued to work in single-channel, exhibiting in a number of venues beyond the gallery and the term single-channel video has expanded from a video tape played back on a monitor to any work produced from a single electronic source or, in fact, any work consisting of a single moving image regardless of source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eai.org/resourceguide/exhibition/singlechannel.html |title=Single-channel Video |publisher=EAI Online Resource Guide for Exhibiting, Collecting &amp; Preserving Media Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.docam.ca/glossaurus/view_Label.php?id=749&amp;lang=1 |title=Glossaurus - "Single-channel video" |website=www.docam.ca |publisher=Documentation and Conservation of Media Arts Heritage (DOCAM)/The DOCAM Research Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; Single-channel works that are produced explicitly for playback on a monitor are primarily concerned with narrative&lt;ref name="Morse"&gt;Morse, Margaret. "Video installation art: the body, the image, and the space-in-between."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4746">'''Symphony No. 1 in B-flat major''' was the first [[symphony]] composed by [[Charles Villiers Stanford]]. It was written in 1876 to compete for a prize offered by the proprietors of the [[Alexandra Palace]]. It came second out of 46 entries earning a prize of £5.&lt;ref&gt;Schaarwächter, Jürgen (2015).

Georg Olms Verlag. {{ISBN|3487152274}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symphony was dedicated to the tenor [[Arthur Duke Coleridge]] who had been a friend of Stanford's at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. It was first played at [[The Crystal Palace]] in London in 1879 but was never published or performed again in Stanford's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Keebaugh, Aaron C. (2004).

[[Naxos Records|Naxos]]&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to Stanford's biographer, Jeremy Dibble, the work shows influences from [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Schumann)|Rhenish Symphony]]'', not only in the [[Ländler]] trios of the second movement but also in Stanford's effective use of "quasi-archaic" passages in the first and last movements to convey a sense of solemn intensity.&lt;ref&gt;Dibble, Jeremy (2002). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VevXghb1SwoC&amp;pg=PA78 ''Charles Villiers Stanford: Man and Musician''], pp. 78–79. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0198163835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movements==
I. Larghetto – Allegro vivace

II. Scherzo: [[Ländler]] tempo  (Trio 1: Presto, Trio 2: Poco più lento)

III. Andante tranquillo 

IV. Finale: Allegro molto 
&lt;!--  The following material is commented out pending a third party source. At the moment it is too subjective:
The first movement is prefaced by an extended brooding introduction whose opening idea is later transformed into its second subject. With a change of tempo the first subject appears on the clarinets, and the movement leaps into life. Several passages are founded on the theme, before the arrival of the second subject;these ideas then form the basis of various episodes until Stanford recapitulates the first subject dramatically on trombones over a fortissimo chord of B flat across the whole orchestra, and the second subject now reappears as a cello solo. The coda is triumphant, the trumpets fan faring the principal themes in augmentation.

The second movement looks back to Beethoven and Schubert in its adoption of a handler rhythm, pointed up by two contrasted trios. The slow movement is hushed, the violins and cholas playing muted throughout, and the second idea, floated on the horns, brings us the mature Stanford's authentic fingerprints, with its flavour of Irish folksong foreshadowing many such horn themes. Surely, too, the use of a solo violin towards the end looks forward to similar usage in later symphonies by many British composers.

The finale with its driving repeated notes perhaps gave Stanford his greatest test. Yet its impetus and energy shows we are in authentic Stanford territory, as do the arrival of the second subject and an episode on the brass, which both in treatment and turn of phrase foreshadow his mature style. The development is crowned by a vigorous fugal based in the first subject, and the workings with the brass episode played by the trombones in imitation, as Stanford builds up the excitement with a chromatically rising bass and ends with a youthful exhibition of high spirits.--&gt;

'''''Symphony of Dialogue''''' (2009) by the [[Turkey|Turkish]] composer [[Evrim Demirel]] reflects the composer's influences on both contemporary Western and traditional Turkish music.  The piece based on the dialogue of diverse cultures; it embraces Christianity, Judaism and Islam in one work of art and conveys their peaceful messages through the music. The novelty of the “Symphony of Dialogue” is having a traditional Qur'an singer in a western way of composed music.

“Symphony of Dialogue” is a pure message of peace and love through the music, which is entirely humanistic in its nature.

==Composition==
Musical voyage starts on a steady sustained chord which appears throughout the piece. Stationary chord is interrupted by the timpani hits amplified with the piano. Interruptions evolve new textures and drag the piece into the more anxious musical territories. Steady and unsteady musical structures interact each other through the piece and the singers endeavor to keep music in a more restful atmosphere.

==Form==
A symbolic expression from the birth to the death of the human being is moulded the form of the work. First tenor solo salutes people by singing a masnavi poem “ Merhaba” which is a part of Mawlid written by Süleyman Çelebi, refers to the observance of the birth of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. Then soprano delivers the message from the Bible that says “ I become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal if I have no love”. Restful messages of the religions continues through the voice of the baritone who vocalize a Psalm from the Old Testament that expresses, “love will follow me all the days of my life”. Eventually three vocalists conclude the music with a poem by [[Yunus Emre]].

:''“Let us be lovers and the loved ones,”''
:''“The earth shall be left to no one.”''

[[File:Charles Robert Leslie - Sir Walter Scott - Ravenswood and Lucy at the Mermaiden's Well - Bride of Lammermoor.jpg|thumb|200px|A scene from ''[[The Bride of Lammermoor]]'']]
'''Tales of my Landlord''' is a series of novels by Sir [[Walter Scott]] (1771–1832) that form a subset of the so-called [[Waverley Novels]]. There are four series:

{| class="wikitable"
! Title !! Published !! Main setting !! Period
|-
|colspan=4|''Tales of My Landlord'', 1st series:
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[The Black Dwarf (novel)|The Black Dwarf]]'' || 1816 || [[Scottish Borders]] || 1707
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[The Tale of Old Mortality]]'' || 1816 || Southern Scotland || 1679–89
|-
|colspan=4|''Tales of my Landlord'', 2nd series:
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[The Heart of Midlothian]]'' || 1818 || [[Edinburgh]], [[Richmond, London]], || 1736
|-
|colspan=4|''Tales of my Landlord'', 3rd series:
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[The Bride of Lammermoor]]'' || 1819 || [[East Lothian]] || 1709–11
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[A Legend of Montrose]]'' || 1819 || [[Scottish Highlands]] || 1644–5
|-
|colspan=4|''Tales of my Landlord'', 4th series:
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[Count Robert of Paris]]'' || 1832 || [[Constantinople]], [[Shkodër|Scutari]] || 1097
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[Castle Dangerous]]'' || 1832 || [[Kirkcudbrightshire]] || 1307
|}

Of these, ''The Heart of Midlothian'' and ''The Bride of Lammermoor'' have been the most successful, and ''Old Mortality'' is considered by modern critics to be among Scott's best work. The fourth were the least successful.

They were so called because they were supposed to be tales collected from the (fictional) landlord of the Wallace Inn at Gandercleugh, compiled by a "Peter Pattieson", and edited and sent to the publisher by [[Jedediah Cleishbotham]]. This is gone into in great depth in the introduction to ''The Black Dwarf''.

The first series was planned to comprise four volumes, each containing a separate novel, but Scott — by his own admission — botched ''The Black Dwarf'', and ''Old Mortality'' came to be three volumes in its own right. [http://www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/works/novels/dwarf.html]. The other three series thus consisted of two volumes each, or just one, in the case of the second.

They were supposed to reflect aspects of Scottish regional life.

The '''Textiles of [[Mexico]]''' have a long history. The making of [[fiber]]s, cloth and other [[textile]] goods has existed in the country since at least 1400 BCE. Fibers used during the pre-Hispanic period included those from the [[yucca]], [[Arecaceae|palm]] and [[Furcraea|maguey]] plants as well as the use of [[cotton]] in the hot lowlands of the south. After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], the Spanish introduced new fibers such as [[silk]] and [[wool]] as well as the European foot treadle [[loom]]. Clothing styles also changed radically. Fabric was produced exclusively in workshops or in the home until the era of [[Porfirio Díaz]] (1880s to 1910), when the mechanization of [[weaving]] was introduced, mostly by the French. 
Today, fabric, clothes and other textiles are both made by craftsmen and in factories. Handcrafted goods include pre-Hispanic clothing such as [[huipil]]s and [[sarape]]s, which are often [[embroidery|embroidered]]. Clothing, [[carpet|rug]]s and more are made with natural and [[natural dye|naturally dyed]] fibers. Most handcrafts are produced by [[Indigenous peoples in Mexico|indigenous people]], whose communities are concentrated in the center and south of the country in states such as [[Mexico State]], [[Oaxaca]] and [[Chiapas]]. The textile industry remains important to the economy of Mexico although it has suffered setback due to competition by cheaper goods produced in countries such as [[China]], [[India]] and [[Vietnam]].

==History==
[[File:Murales Rivera - Färberei.jpg|thumb|Diego Rivera mural depicting the making of textiles in the pre-Hispanic period]]

===Pre-Hispanic period===
The oldest known fabric fragments in Mexico have been found in the arid north of the country in states such as [[Coahuila]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and [[Durango]] and date to approximately between 1800 and 1400 BCE.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=424 |title=El Textil Artesanal en México, Introducción – Antecedentes Históricos |publisher=Universidad Veracruzana |location=Veracruz, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Textile Crafts in Mexico, Introduction - Historical Precedents |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717083752/http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=424 |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In pre-Hispanic times, the most common woven fibers in dry areas were from the yucca and palm trees, with cotton grown in the hot humid areas near the coast. It was unknown to the [[Aztec]]s until they conquered cotton growing areas and began demanding it as tribute. Then, only the upper classes were permitted to wear it. Given the important status cotton cloth had, it is often used as money. For some ceremonial garments, [[amate]] or bark paper was used.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="despues"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=7041&amp;id_seccion=2722 |title=Evolucion del Textil en México despues de la Colonia |work=Artes e Historia |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Evolution of textiles in Mexico after the colonial period |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719094504/http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=7041&amp;id_seccion=2722# |archive-date=2011-07-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Each of the sedentary Mesoamerican cultures had a god of weaving. Women were often buried with woven items they had made. Cortés mentions the Aztecs’ skill in weaving in one of this letters to the king of Spain, in very favorable terms.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;

===Colonial era===
[[File:WeaverTexcoco1.JPG|thumb|Weaver using foot treadle loom of the type introduced by the Spanish]]
After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the production of cloth and the wearing of clothes in Mesoamerica changed drastically. Most pre-Hispanic forms of dress and body adornment were banned by the Spanish as “uncivilized.” Indigenous, European and Asian fabrics influenced Mexican cloth production by the mid colonial period.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="despues"/&gt; The Spanish did not favor the native cotton, nor did they find the material produced on traditional [[Loom#Back strap loom|backstrap looms]] wide enough. New techniques and materials were introduced. Spanish modes of dress, itself a mixture of European, [[Asia Minor]] and [[Egypt]]ian influences, were introduced as well. At first wool and silk fabric was imported, then sheep and [[silkworm]]s as well as European foot pedal looms all by the late 1530s. By 1580, Mexico had become one of the most productive areas for wool and silk cloth. Most of the production was concentrated in the present day states of Oaxaca, [[Tlaxcala]] and [[Puebla]]. At first Spanish weavers dominated production, but they were soon replaced by native weavers who were making material cheaper. Instead of prohibiting Indian made fabric, European weavers decided instead to hire them, creating workshops. While the indigenous weavers were not paid much, the Spanish owners did make money. These workshops eventually produced enough fabric for both internal consumption and for export to [[Spain]], the [[Philippines]], [[Central America]] and [[Peru]]. Silk cloth production was particularly dominant from 1540 to 1580; However, the end of this period, the yearly [[Manila Galleon]] was regularly bringing cheaper silk from Asia.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="despues"/&gt;

While cotton cloth was not favored by the Europeans, it was still made and offered as tribute to Spanish overlords. Commercializing the fiber was difficult as the plant grows in the lowlands near the oceans and not near the manufacturing areas in the highlands, and transportation costs were high. Large cotton weaving workshops were not founded until the second half of the 17th century. Eventually, the production of this fabric as well as wool fabric filled the gap left by the disappearance of Mexican silk fabric production.  Wool fabric remained important because it was favored by the upper tiers of colonial society, and because sheep could be raised near major weaving areas, such as [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]],  [[Querétaro, Querétaro|Querétaro]], [[Morelia|Valladolid]], [[Acámbaro]], and [[San Miguel de Allende]].&lt;ref name="despues"/&gt;

===19th century to present===

[[File:Textiles Taller 2.jpg|thumb|Finishing a [[rebozo]] wrap at a workshop at the [[Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City]].]]
In times past, fabric and clothing were made to last for decades, but today fabric is much cheaper and much of what clothing is bought is soon thrown away. This is mostly due to the mechanization of weaving, which has made fabric inexpensive.&lt;ref name="ecological"&gt;{{cite news |title= Los nuevos textiles ecológicos |author= Gabriela Casavantes |url=http://www2.esmas.com/mujer/ecomujer/099481/los-nuevos-textiles-ecolgicos |newspaper=es mas |location=Mexico |date=February 3, 2010 |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The new ecological textiles |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Mexico, as in other parts of the world, the introduction of modern transportation and communications brought about major changes in the production and distribution of goods and in firms' management and structure.&lt;ref name="porfirian"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gómez-Galvarriato |first1=Aurora  |date=Autumn 2008 |title= Networks and Entrepreneurship: The Modernization of the Textile Business in Porfirian Mexico |journal=Business History Review |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=475–505 |doi=10.1017/s0007680500082611}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 19th century, industrialization affected textile production with the introduction of steam-powered machines and the efforts of French immigrants from [[Barcelonnette]], who began to arrive in Mexico in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="porfirian"/&gt;  The mass production of textiles, especially cotton textiles, developed earlier than in other countries outside of Western Europe and the United States, nearing the same level as in England in the mid-18th century despite social unrest at that time. Mechanization of cloth production began in the 1830s; however, high internal taxes among states kept production facilities small and unconsolidated. While Mexican production lagged behind that of Europe, certain regions of the country such as La Laguna, in the modern states of [[Durango]] and Coahuila, became important producers of cotton fabric. The most widely produced fabric was called “manta,” a natural cotton favored by many indigenous groups.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;

The development of steamship lines and railroad networks allowed Mexico-produced fabrics to be exported. The consolidation of power by Porfirio Díaz in the 1880s opened up business opportunities and made foreign investment possible. By the end of the 19th century, textile production and distribution was the country’s largest manufacturing sector, mostly controlled by French immigrants. The immigrants worked together, forming the “Barcelonnette network.” They started off with small textile mills and dry goods stores, which eventually grew into large factories and [[department store]]s, including [[Palacio de Hierro]], which still exists.  These French immigrants consolidated textile operations by the end of the 19th century, and by the start of the [[Mexican Revolution]] changed their power source from steam to electricity. They also changed textile mills from mostly family-owned organizations to more modern enterprises with professional managers and stock sold on exchanges.&lt;ref name="porfirian"/&gt;

The [[sewing machine]] appeared in the early 20th century and became widely used to join fabric and for embroidery . This led to another level of textile production: finished clothing.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;

==Craft and indigenous textiles today==

===Indigenous tradition===
[[File:WeaverZaachila2.JPG|thumb|Woman in Zaachila, Oaxaca weaving with a backstrap loom]]

Textiles is one of Mexico’s more important crafts as it represents the continuation of tradition as well as its fusion with modern designs and techniques. Both pre-Hispanic and colonial era style textiles are still made in Mexico. In addition, many of the textile factories use machines based on old foot pedal looms from the colonial period. There are basically four types of fibers used for fabric production:&lt;ref name="turedomex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.edomexico.gob.mx/iifaem/htm/html/textil.htm |title= TEXTIL Artesania Mexiquense |publisher= Secretaria de Turismo Estado de Mexico |location=Mexico State |language=Spanish |trans-title=Craft textiles in Mexico State |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Vegetable products such as cotton
* Animal products such as wool and silk
* Minerals such as [[Goldwork (embroidery)|gold and silver thread]]
* Synthetics.
Raw materials for textiles fall into two groups: smooth fibers such as silk, cotton, and wool, introduced to the American continent by the [[conquistador]]s; and hard fibers native to Mexico such as [[ixtle]], [[lechuguilla]], reeds, palm, twigs,  and [[willow]]. In indigenous regions of Mexico, women are responsible for clothing the community, a process which often begins with harvesting natural fibers and then [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]], [[dyeing]], and weaving textiles. In various parts of Mexico, both native backstrap looms and pedal-driven looms of European origin are used to weave principally cotton and wool.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/208-the-artesanias-of-michoacan-an-introduction |title= The artesanias of Michoacan - an introduction  |date= October 9, 2008 |publisher=MexConnect |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most handcrafted textiles are produced by the sixty or so indigenous ethnic groups in Mexico, who mostly live in rural areas in the center and south of the country. In these textiles, traditional indigenous designs, and in some cases techniques still survive.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;  One common technique in craft fabric is [[brocade]], which allows for raised designs to be woven into the cloth.&lt;ref name="maestros"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=6235&amp;id_seccion=5334&amp;id_subseccion=3050&amp;id_documento=821 |title= Para convertir la hebra en telas Salon de Maestros de Arte Popular |work= Artes e Historia |location= Mexico |language= Spanish |trans-title= Converting fiber into cloth – Masters’ Room at the (Museum of ) Popular Art |accessdate= June 1, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110719094522/http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=6235&amp;id_seccion=5334&amp;id_subseccion=3050&amp;id_documento=821 |archivedate= July 19, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most indigenous textiles are made at home by women and used for clothing, home use, decorative use and ceremonial use. Items include those that are hand woven, hand embroidered, [[knitting|knitted]] and more.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;  Clothing is one of the ways that these groups distinguish themselves from each other and the world at large. Some of these garments include the huipil, the [[quechquemitl]], [[Tilmàtli|tilmas]], sandals and [[rebozo]]s.&lt;ref name="artshistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=7041&amp;id_seccion=845583 |title=Introduccion al Textil de la Epoca Contemporanea |author=CONACULTa |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Introduction to textiles of the modern era |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719094529/http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=7041&amp;id_seccion=845583# |archive-date=2011-07-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of ethnic groups, such as the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] in central Mexico commercialize their original and traditional creations as well as produce them for domestic consumption. People in coastal areas continue to plant cotton, spin it, dye it with natural elements such as [[indigo]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

===Indigenous clothing===
[[File:MixDressRMH.JPG|thumb|100px|Huipil on display at the Regional Museum of [[Huajuapan]].]]
Most of the pre-Hispanic clothing that survives is for women.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;  These include “enredos”, or wrap dresses, fajas, or cloth belts, huipils, a type of tunic, quechquemitl, which is a kind of rectangular or square short poncho. The last was originally worn directly on the upper body of a woman but today it is worn over a blouse.&lt;ref name="2uvtextil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=655 |title=El Textil Artesanal en México Los Diseños |publisher=Universidad Veracruzana |location=Veracruz, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Craft textiles in Mexico Introduction- Designs |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717083815/http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=655 |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loose-fitting sack dresses, called huipils in Oaxaca and guanengos in [[Michoacán]], are often heavily embroidered with [[running stitch|straight stitching]], [[cross stitches|cross stitching]] and [[tuck (sewing)|tucks]] with floral and geometric motifs.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;
[[File:RebozosBeltsZaachila.JPG|thumb|left|Rebozos and "fajas" or sash/belts for sale in Zaachila, Oaxaca]]
A widely used garment in both indigenous and mixed race communities is the rebozo. This is a long rectangular shawl used both as a wrap and as a means to carry children or heavy objects tied onto the body. The rebozo came about during the colonial period, not in the pre-Hispanic era.&lt;ref name="2uvtextil"/&gt;  The rebozo is a synthesis of three historical influences, the pre-Hispanic “mámatl,” the Spanish mantilla and the “repacejo,” an Oriental garment.&lt;ref name="turedomex"/&gt;  This is a long rectangular piece of cloth with long [[fringe (textiles)|fringes]] at both ends. Most rebozos are made with multicolored designs woven into the pieces using threads of different colors. Those of a single color are usually made of yarn or thread that has been [[tie-dye]]d to produce color variations in the final piece. This latter style is called “jaspe” or jasper and are usually woven on backstrap looms.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;

The rebozo has been produced mostly in central Mexico since the colonial period, with some of the best known producers in Mexico State and Michoacan. [[Tenancingo, Mexico State|Tenancingo]] is one of the best known producers of craft rebozos, usually made of cotton but wool is also used. Traditional rebozos in the [[Lake Pátzcuaro]] area are often of white and blue over a black background and may be embroidered in tiny cross stitch.&lt;ref name="turedomex"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;
[[File:Sarape patrn.jpg|left|thumb|Portion of a sarape]]
Few pre-Hispanic male clothing pieces survive since many [[Mesoamerica]]n males went about nude or semi nude, causing Spanish authorities to force them to adopt European shirts and pants early. This early colonial style shirts and pants have changed little in indigenous communities and are now identified with indigenous groups, especially the [[Tarahumara]] in Chihuahua, the [[Tacuate people|Tacuates]] in Oaxaca and the [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal]]s in Chiapas.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;  Many male garments are heavily embroidered in multiple colors.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;  Since indigenous pants lack pockets, many men carry decorated bags called [[moral]]s. The only pre-Hispanic male garment to survive is the sarape, which is used only in certain areas of Mexico.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;

In addition to clothing, other items are woven such as bedspreads, blankets, hats, cinches and knapsacks. The designs for these are most often woven into the fabric itself, but embroidered stars, border designs, deer, and other can be seen as well. These items may be made with various fibers include those derived from the maguey plant.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

===Embroidery===
[[File:Embroidery by Virginia Sa¦ünchez de Cornelio.jpg|thumb|left|Embroidered panel by Virginia Sanchez de Cornelio of Oaxaca]]
[[File:BlousesSkirtsHuastecaMAP.JPG|thumb|Embroidered blouses from the [[La Huasteca]] region of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]].]]
One of the most distinctive aspects of indigenous handcrafted textiles is the use of embroidery. Indigenous motifs found on garments range from geometric patterns, [[zig-zag]], spirals, moons, crosses and [[fretwork|stepped frets]]. Thin cloth belts that wrap around the waist (fajillas) are common in a number of indigenous groups and are richly embroidered. The borders are often adorned with zig-zag edging, such as those of the [[Huichol people|Huichol]]s. The [[Otomi people|Otomi]]s use a moon pattern on these belts along with their morrals or carrying bags, and the Tarahumara tend to decorate theirs with triangular designs. Many of the embroidery patterns of the huipils in Oaxaca, also show pre-Hispanic influence. Flower designs are popular for embroidering women’s clothing among the Otomis, Nahuas, [[Huastecs]], Huichols and others. Spirals and curved designs appear with frequency especially in the center and south of the country.&lt;ref name="2uvtextil"/&gt;

In addition to flowers, other themes from nature in woven and embroidered designs include plants, animals such as squirrels, rabbits, deer, armadillos, doves, hummingbirds, pelicans, seagulls and fish. [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]] embroidered belts are known for their zoomorphic designs and those of [[Santo Tomás Jalieza]] tend to have images of large plumed birds. The cloth napkins of [[San Mateo del Mar]] have images of aquatic birds such as pelicans and seagulls, with those of the Tacuates of [[Santiago Zacatepec]] have borders with many diminutive animals such as centipedes, scorpions, birds, iguanas, cats, foxes and more.&lt;ref name="2uvtextil"/&gt;

Human figures appear with relative frequency as well. They feature prominently on the embroidered napkins of [[San Juan Colorado]] and as Danza de la Pluma dancers on the cloth belts of Santo Tomás Jalieza. Patriotic symbols such as two-headed eagles, the three colors of the Mexican flag and the eagle with serpent crest. These are most prevalent in the central region of the country among the Otomis, Nahuas, Huastecos, Huicholes and others.&lt;ref name="2uvtextil"/&gt;
Christian symbols such as the cross, virgins, saints, angels and other elements were introduced by evangelists in the early colonial period. These appear on small and large pieces such as men’s shirts among the Tzotzil in Chiapas, in the fabrics of [[San Miguel Ameyalco]], which feature churches, and the appearance of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] in many textiles in the [[Sierra Norte de Puebla|Sierra Norte]] of Puebla.&lt;ref name="2uvtextil"/&gt;

Popular sayings or phrases also appear especially in the textiles of the Purépecha around Lake Pátzcuaro and in the state of Puebla.&lt;ref name="2uvtextil"/&gt;

===Looms===
[[File:WeavingTeotitlan1.JPG|thumb|150px|Man working on treadle loom in Teotitlan del Valle, Oaxaca]]
Two types of looms are employed in the making are handcrafted fabrics, the pre-Hispanic backstrap loom and the introduced European foot pedal loom. Traditionally, weaving, especially on the backstrap loom, was considered to be women’s work. Women still produce items such as kitchen cloths, tablecloths, carrying bags and ornamental items with traditional designs. Although considered primitive, the backstrap loom is versatile and allows for different techniques and combinations of techniques, some of which can be very complicated. It allows for the combining of different fibers such as cotton with wool or silk.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;  Designs are woven into the cloth on this loom by changing thread colors and/or by adding items such as shells or other matter into the finished product. The backstrap loom is most prevalent in the south of the country.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;

The foot pedal loom was brought to Mexico after the Conquest. Unlike pieces done on backstrap looms, pieces done on these machines have traditionally been done by men with wool being the favored fiber.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;   This type of loom is most extensively used in the center and north of the country.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;  The principal advantage of this loom is that it allows for pieces of greater width than backstrap looms and has been used to create sarapes, rugs, blankets and more.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;

===Rugs and other items made in Oaxaca and Mexico State===
[[File:Family of Bulmaro Pe¦ürez Mendoza finishing off a tapete.jpg|left|thumb|Bulmaro Perez Mendoza family finishing off a rug]]
Two states that continue to have significant handcrafted textile production are Oaxaca and Mexico State. Oaxaca is known for its variety of handcrafted textiles including rugs, rebozos, tablecloths and traditional clothing such as huipils. These are made backstrap looms or foot pedal looms.&lt;ref name="elcolor"&gt;{{cite news |title= El color de tus textiles |author=Alicia Boy |newspaper=Reforma |location= Mexico City |date=September 17, 2000 |page=5 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The color of your textiles }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico State craft pieces are mostly produced in [[Jiquipilco]], [[Tejupilco de Hidalgo]], [[Temascaltepec de González]], [[Temoaya]], [[Valle de Bravo]], [[Zacazonapan]], [[Toluca]] and Tenancingo producing napkins, tablecloths, sheets, kitchen items, clothing, bathroom items, rebozos and rugs.&lt;ref name="turedomex"/&gt;
[[File:DiamanteMEAPO.JPG|thumb|150px|"Diamante Ojo de Dios" by Antonio Ruiz Gonzalez of Teotitlan del Valle at Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca]]
Both states also are significant producers of rugs. The making of knotted rugs by the Otomi in Mexico State is relatively recent. It began in 1969 when Ernesto Fernández Hurtado of the Bank of Mexico decided to promote a pilot center in Temoaya for the study and manufacture of this type of rug using traditional Otomi designs. Today, these rugs are a distinctive feature in Mexico State crafts. The rugs are made with 100% virgin wool and have an average knot density of 140,000 m2. There are about 21 different designs offered with 250 variations in colors and size.&lt;ref name="turedomex"/&gt;  Most are sold in upper-class neighborhoods of Mexico City, but due to the problem of cheap imitations, some vendors only sell from their workshops.&lt;ref name="encuentros"&gt;{{cite news |title= Encuentros con Mexico / Nudos que asombran en el Estado de Mexico|author=Ricardo Diazmunoz |author2=Maryell Ortiz de Zarate |newspaper=Reforma |location= Mexico City |date=August 21, 2005 |page=10 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Encounters in Mexico/Knots that amaze in Mexico State }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Teotitlán del Valle]] in Oaxaca is known for its woven rugs. Most producers make their rugs on foot pedal looms using wool dyed with [[natural dye|natural materials]] such as [[Indigo dye|indigo]] and the [[cochineal]] bug.&lt;ref name="valles"&gt;{{cite news |title= Los valles centrales de Oaxaca  |author=Carlos Puga |newspaper=Reforma |location= Mexico City |date=October 31, 1999 |page=14 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The central valleys of Oaxaca }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rugs are also produced in [[San Pablo de Mitla|Mitla]], [[Santa Ana del Valle]] and [[Tlacolula de Matamoros]] along with blankets and a type of sarape.&lt;ref name="elcolor"/&gt;  One distinguishing feature of Oaxaca rug production is the use of the cochineal insect. This insect has been used since pre-Hispanic times to dye fiber, producing colors ranging from purple to yellow, varying depending on what the ingredients, such as certain flowers or lime juice, are added. For a time, the use of natural dyes was threatened by cheaper [[synthetic dye|synthetics]] but the use of natural dyes has made a comeback.&lt;ref name="elcolor"/&gt;

===Value and protection of handcrafted textiles===
[[File:RugsTexSaleTeotitlan1.JPG|thumb|left|Rugs and other textiles for sale in Teotitlan del Valle, Oaxaca]]
After the Mexican Revolution, references to native Mexican cultures became fashionable, including arts crafts food and regional clothing. This was expressed in the arts by those such as [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Dr. Atl]].&lt;ref name="artshistory"/&gt;
Since that time, there have been a number of efforts to maintain and expand the textile producing traditions, especially of the south of Mexico. The Textile Museum has a collection of 4,000 pieces and is located in the former monastery of San Pablo in the [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|city of Oaxaca]]. The museum was opened in 2008 and sponsored by the [[Alfredo Harp Helú]] Foundation. The pieces include modern, colonial and pre-Hispanic textiles. Clothing items include huipils, enredos, quechquemilts, skirts, rugs and wall hangings. The collection is in three divisions Textiles of Oaxaca, Textiles of Mexico and Textiles of the World.&lt;ref name="anuncian"&gt;{{cite news |title= Anuncian nueva sede para Museo Textil de Oaxaca |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/467152.html |agency=Notimex |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=December 11, 2007 |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=New site announced for the Textile Museum of Oaxaca }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sna' Jolobil, or House of the Textiles in the [[Tzotzil language]], is a cooperative of more than 600 Tzotzil and Tzeltal women in 12 municipalities in Chiapas based in [[San Cristóbal de las Casas]]. It was founded to promote and elevate the textile crafts, especially those produced on backstrap looms, with the aim of preserving traditional techniques and designs as well as promoting the economic fortunes of women weavers. The organization has a collection of antique huipils available for study and reproduction as well as workshops in weaving and producing vegetable dyes. The organization has been successful in attracting more young people into the craft. In 1986, it received the Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes (National Prize of Sciences and the Artes) and numerous members have earned individual awards for their work.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;

[[File:ClothesSaleSolidaridadDF.JPG|thumb|Traditional clothing for sale on a sidewalk in Mexico City]]
Federal agencies such as [[FONART]] and various state agencies have their own promotional efforts including annual crafts contests and the recognition of masters in various fields, including textiles.  [[Florentina López de Jesús]] is an [[Amusga people|Amusgo]] from [[Xochistlahuaca]], [[Guerrero]]. She learned to weave from her mother at six years of age as well as to prepare raw cotton and spin it into yarn. She continued to weave as well as to do other jobs to help out her family. As an adult she began to make pieces specifically for sale such as tablecloths, placemats, rebozos and huipils, traveling to [[Ometepec]] to market. Her work caught the attention of FONART in between 1969 and 1971, which led to her becoming a member of the La Flor de Xochistlahuaca artisans’ cooperative. Since then, she has given workshops to people in her region as well as the Curso de Tintes Naturales sobre Algodon (Natural Dyes for Cotton Course) in 1994 and has promoted the use of brown cotton called “coyochi.” Her work has won a number of awards including 2nd place Gran Premio de Arte Popular, FONART in 1987, 1st place Gran Premio de Arte Popular, FONART in 1991 and Premio Nacional de Artesanias de SECOFI in 1993.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;

Juan Rayón Salinas, whose parents were craftsmen, is from Mexico State. He began working with textiles in 1970, and in 1971 the state government began work to open a Centro de Capacitación de Tapiz y de Bajo Liso to introduce European techniques for making rugs. Traditionally Rayón’s hometown of [[Xonacatlán]] made wool sarapes, but he entered the center specializing in throw rugs. He work was recognized and he began to participate in exhibitions in Mexico and abroad. After working for a time with the Centro, he established his own independent workshop. His work can be seen in various cities in Mexico as well as in New York. Also from Xonacatlán, Reyna Rayón Salinas is known for her cloth belts and embroidery, which she has been making since she was 12.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;
[[File:TzotzilDressMAPDF.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Garb from the Nahua community of Cuetzalan, Puebla, on display at the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City]]
Cosme Flores is from the [[Tlaxcala, Tlaxcala|city of Tlaxcala]], son and grandson of weavers who made wool rugs. He began weaving when he was 11 along with working in agriculture. His work has won various prizes such as first place in the Concurso Estatal de Artesanias Tlaxcaltecas in 1993 and 1994. His work is also featured in a permanent exhibition at the Museo de Artes y Tradiciones Populares de Tlaxcala.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;

Justina Oviedo Rangel is of the [[Huave people|Huave ethnic group]] in Oaxaca. She began weaving when she was eight on her own while playing. When her mother saw her ability, she began to give her formal lessons. She specializes in napkins, placeholders and tablecloths, but also makes huipils. She also makes figures of clay. Her work has won awards such as the Concurso de Tejido de San Mateo del Mar in 1978 and various times since then until 1989.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;

Evaristo Borboa was born in Tenancingo, Mexico State, where the making of rebozos is a tradition. He began weaving when he was 12, making rebozos using a backstrap loom, rather than the European loom. This means that each of his rebozos are made individually rather 26-30 at a time, which is possible with larger looms. He is also known for his knotted or “ikat” technique as well as the jasper style. Interested in older styles of rebozos, he began in experiment in 1947 with these older designs. In the 1960s, upon visiting the Virgin of [[Zapopan]], he noticed that the image was wrapped only in a simple shawl. He offered to make the image new rebozo, something he has done every year since. Recognition has come late in Borboa's life winning awards from FONART and state agencies starting in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;
[[File:Zinacantán - Tissage traditionnel.JPG|thumb|Woman weaving on backstrap loom in Chiapas]]
Handcrafted textiles have also been promoted as a tourist attraction in its own right. This is especially true in the state of Chiapas.&lt;ref name="piratechina"&gt;{{cite news |title= Peligra artesanía por piratería china |url= http://www.terra.com.mx/Turismo/articulo/175211/ |agency=Notimex |newspaper=Terra |location=Mexico |date=November 11, 2005 |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Chinese pirated items putting crafts in danger }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican handcrafted textiles have experienced a resurgence of interest due to the reassessment of them as a luxury item and the rising interest in some consumer sectors in locally crafted wares. Many of these textiles are being incorporated into items sold by globally recognized brands.&lt;ref name="cnnexpan"&gt;{{cite news |title= Industria del lujo revalora la artesanía |author=Marco A. Hernández |url= http://www.cnnexpansion.com/estilo/2010/04/16/artesania-glocal |newspaper=CNN Expansión |date=April 19, 2010 |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Luxury industry revalues crafts }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Vuitton]], who has manufacturing facilities in Mexico, sponsored an exhibition called “Historias de Tradición artesanal” (Stories of Artisan Tradition) at the [[Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City|Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="cnnexpan"/&gt;

However, handcrafted textiles not only compete with other types of imported textiles, but also countries like China and [[Guatemala]] are producing imitations of traditional Mexican indigenous designs. These can be found both inside and outside of Mexico. The Asociacion de Mujeres Empresarias in Chiapas considers the imitations to be a form of trademark infringement and puts native weavers livelihoods at risk. Organizations such as this work to have indigenous designs marked as intangible world heritage to protect it with markers for authenticity—much as is done for [[tequila]] or [[Talavera (pottery)|Talavera pottery]].&lt;ref name="piratechina"/&gt;

==Current textile industry==

===Current importance of the sector===
Modern textile production in Mexico dates back to the era of Porfirio Díaz from the 1880s to 1910.&lt;ref name="porfirian"/&gt;  Today, textile production plays an important role in the [[gross domestic product]] of Mexico, since it is exported and generates employment. Textile production includes the making of thread, cloth and decoration, in both natural and synthetic fibers. It accounts for about 1.2% of the total GDP and 7.1% of the manufacturing sector.&lt;ref name="mineconomy"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.economia.gob.mx/?P=1326 |title= Programa para la competitividad de la cadena de fribra textile-vestido |author= Oscar Escalera Antezana  |publisher= Ministry of the Economy of Mexico |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Program for the competitiveness of the fiber textile clothing chain |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the fourth largest manufacturing activity in the country.&lt;ref name="dragon"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wharton.universia.net/index.cfm?fa=viewfeature&amp;id=911&amp;language=english |title= The Chinese Dragon Threatens Mexico’s Textile Industry |date= Feb 9, 2005  |publisher=Wharton School de la Universidad de Pennsylvania y Universia.  |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the end of the Mexican Revolution to the mid-2000s, the sector saw steady growth. Much of the growth in the last four decades was spearheaded by “maquiladoras” or manufacturing plants along the northern border, which can import raw materials duty-free to make exportable products.&lt;ref name="meltdown"&gt;{{cite news |title= Maquila meltdown |author=BILL MONGELLUZZO |newspaper=Journal of Commerce |location=New York |date=April 14, 2003 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important textile area is the state of [[Guanajuato]], which is Mexico’s third largest producer. Some of these products include clothing, thread and sewing fabric, sheets, tablecloths, decorative pillows, rugs, carpets and tarps. Clothing items include jeans, other pants, blouses, [[tshirts]], sweaters, vests, jackets, skirts and others, for national and international brands such as [[Liverpool (store)|Liverpool]], Chipieco, Carhartt, Echojeans, Polo Ralph Lauren, JCPenney, Old Navy, Timberland and more.&lt;ref name="irapuato"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irapuato.gob.mx/Negocios/negociostextil.php |title=Industria Textil |publisher=Ayuntamiento de Irapuato |location=Irapuato, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Textile Industry |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the mid-2000s, the sector began to decline, mostly due to foreign competition. A significant number of jobs have been lost since 2003 as well as a number of factories. Many of these operations and jobs are shifting to Asia.&lt;ref name="dragon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="meltdown"/&gt;

===Exports to the United States===
The U.S. is the largest textile importer and almost all textile producing countries compete for a share of this market. Mexico ranks fourth in textile exports to the U.S. according to OTEXA.&lt;ref name="irapuato"/&gt;&lt;ref name="costosos"&gt;{{cite news |title= Resultan costosos textiles mexicanos |author=Myriam Garcia |newspaper=El Norte |location=Monterrey, Mexico |date=August 9, 2005 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexican textiles turn out to be costly }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mexico’s advantages in this market is it proximity and favorable tariffs, especially since the passage of NAFTA. In 2004, all restrictions and quotas on Mexican textiles were lifted in the United States.&lt;ref name="dragon"/&gt;

However, textile exports to the U.S. fell from more than 11 billion dollars in 2004 to just over 10 billion in 2005,&lt;ref name="demandachina"&gt;{{cite news |title= Mexico demandara a China por practicas ilegales; [Source: El Universal]|author=Guadalupe Hernandez Espinosa |newspaper=NoticiasFinancieras |location=Miami |date=June 17, 2005 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexico sues China for illegal practices }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the U.S. imports more from other countries, who produce more cheaply.&lt;ref name="mineconomy"/&gt;

From January through September 2004, U.S. imports of Mexican-made apparel reached $5.069 billion, 4.3% below the total registered for the same period in 2003, according to the CNIV, Mexico’s textile industry association. Meanwhile, U.S. imports of Chinese garments grew 21.7% during that period to reach $6.69 billion Yet Mexican-made products began to lose their competitiveness in the U.S. because taxes and tariffs on imports from other countries were also dropping.&lt;ref name="dragon"/&gt;

===Non-U.S. markets===
While the U.S. is by far the major market for Mexican textiles, Mexico has free-trade pacts with 43 countries, one of the largest such networks in the world. Until very recently, this did not include China, which has been seen as an “enemy” rather than as a potential trading partner. There has been changes in this as Mexico seeks to expand business ties with China, especially in attracting capital.&lt;ref name="dragon"/&gt; In the Americas, Mexico is part of the Central America Tree Trade Agreement,&lt;ref name="schwab"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Schwab Signs Textile Customs Cooperation Agreement with Mexico Office of the United States Trade Representative |publisher=U.S. Trade Representative |year=2007 |url=http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/press-releases/archives/2007/january/schwab-signs-textile-customs-cooperation- |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528014442/http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/press-releases/archives/2007/january/schwab-signs-textile-customs-cooperation-# |archive-date=2010-05-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and recently Mexico and Peru struck a deal for the import and export of clothing and other textiles.&lt;ref name="aztec21"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://azteca21.com/n/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11582:considerable-potencial-de-comercio-entre-sectores-textil-y-vestido-de-mexico-y-peru-intermoda&amp;catid=5&amp;Itemid=356|title= Considerable potencial de comercio entre sectores textil y vestido de México y Perú: INTERMODA |date=December 2009 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Considerable business potential between the textile and clothing sectors of Mexico and Peru:Intermoda |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico’s textile exports to Canada increased fivefold by the mid-2000s, raising its market share in that country to five percent. Export growth to Canada has slowed since then but remains fairly strong.&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-621-m/11-621-m2005022-eng.htm |title= Stretching or Shrinking? The Textile and Clothing Industries in Canada |author= Diana Wyman |publisher= International Trade Division Statistics Canada |location=Canada |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic clothing market===
Nine major chain stores control 40% of the brick-and-mortar sales, but approximately 58% of the domestic clothing market obtains its goods through illegal channels, either through smuggling, robbery or the evasion of taxes.&lt;ref name="mineconomy"/&gt; Much of the illegal Chinese textiles sold in Mexico enter through the United States, where labels are changed to avoid Mexico's 533% tariff on Chinese goods.&lt;ref name="demandachina"/&gt;

===Mexico’s international competitors===

In addition to those from China, Mexican textile exports face competition from India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Indonesia]],&lt;ref name="dragon"/&gt; Vietnam, Hong Kong and Central America.&lt;ref name="mineconomy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="costosos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vietrival"&gt;{{cite news |title= Vietnam se convierte en rival textil para México |author= Manuel Lombera Martínez |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/finanzas/54833.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=November 15, 2006 |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Vietnam becomes a textile rival for Mexico }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Mexican textiles held around 12% of the U.S. market while Indian textiles 3.84%. Other Asian countries with presence include Hong Kong (5.7%), Indonesia (5.3), Vietnam and Bangladesh (5% each) .&lt;ref name="indiaolvera"&gt;{{cite news |title= Supera India en textiles a Mexico |author=Silvia Olvera |author2=Alberto Barrientos |newspaper=El Norte |location=Monterrey, Mexico |date=March 17, 2006 |page=5 |language=Spanish |trans-title=India surpasses Mexico in textiles }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the reason for this is that labor costs are significantly higher in Mexico than in Asia. Mexico also has regulations that inhibit investment, as well as stricter environmental laws.&lt;ref name="mineconomy"/&gt;  Mexican fabrics cost 3.45 dollars per square meter while Chinese textiles cost 2.69 dollars. While the cost of Mexican fabric has increased 2%, those from a number of other countries in Asia and Central America have gone down. One major factor behind this is Mexico’s relatively expensive labor costs.&lt;ref name="costosos"/&gt; Another reason Asian products are cheaper is that utilities such electricity, gas and transport is cheaper.&lt;ref name="vietrival"/&gt;

China is Mexico’s most important competitor. Not only are products from this country cheaper, the supply chain in China is more organized than in Mexico. For example, most threads used to sew clothing are produced in China; Mexico produces little, creating the need to import such. This can cause production delays. Mexico is also mostly limited to the making of basic items with little added value instead of more fashionable products that sell for more. In addition, Mexico also has protectionist policies designed to inhibit foreign investment and ownership of textile production facilities in the country.&lt;ref name="dragon"/&gt;

One example of this is the [[maquiladora]] industries. Prior to the 2000s, maquiladoras owned by Asian concerns who imported materials from Asia to make products for the U.S. enjoyed the same tax advantages as those who used Mexican suppliers. However, this was changed during the beginning of the 21st century. This caused many Asian maquiladoras to close and move to Asia as the tax advantages no longer compensated for higher labor costs.&lt;ref name="meltdown"/&gt;

Mexico has also complained to the [[World Trade Organization]] that China has been engaging in “illegal practices” such as “dumping” (selling abroad at a price lower than local markets) to the detriment of the Mexican industry. Mexico claims that the Chinese government subsidizes textiles sales abroad to gain market share.&lt;ref name="demandachina"/&gt;

'''''The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul''''' is a 1988 humorous [[fantasy]] [[detective fiction|detective]] novel by [[Douglas Adams]]. It is the second book by Adams featuring [[detective|private detective]] [[Dirk Gently]], the first being ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]''. The title is a phrase that appeared in Adams' novel ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'' to describe the wretched boredom of immortal being [[Wowbagger|Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged]], and is a play on the theological treatise ''[[Dark Night of the Soul]]'', by [[Saint John of the Cross]].

The novel is named for that time on a Sunday, after afternoon but before evening, as the week-end had finished but the week had not yet begun, that occurred to Adams as a listless limbo of the working man:
{{bquote|In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn't cope with, and that terrible listlessness which starts to set in at about 2:55, when you know that you've had all the baths you can usefully have that day, that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the papers you will never actually read it, or use the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four o'clock, and you will enter the long dark teatime of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Douglas|last=Adams|title=The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul|date=1988-10-10|publisher=Heinemann|location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Plot summary==
Dirk Gently, who calls himself a "[[holism|holistic]] detective", has happened upon what he thinks is a rather comfortable situation. A wealthy man in the [[record industry]] has retained him, spinning a story about being stalked by a seven-foot-tall, green-eyed, [[scythe]]-wielding monster. Dirk pretends to understand the man's ravings involving potatoes and a contract signed in blood coming due; when in reality, Dirk is musing about what he might do if he actually receives payment for his "services" – such as getting rid of his [[refrigerator]], which is so filthy inside that it has become the centrepiece of a show-down between himself and his cleaning woman. The seriousness of his client's claims becomes clear when Dirk arrives several hours late for an appointment to find a swarm of police around his client's estate. The aforementioned client is found in a sealed and heavily barricaded room, his head neatly removed several feet from his body and rotating on a [[Phonograph|turn-table]]. While at his recently deceased client's house, he discovers that his client had a son. However, after Dirk disconnects the television set the boy had been watching, the boy promptly breaks Dirk's nose.

Nearly incapacitated by guilt, Dirk resolves to take his now-late client's wild claims seriously. During his investigation, Gently encounters exploding airport check-in counters, the gods of [[Norse mythology]], insulting [[horoscope]]s, a sinister [[nursing home]], a [[nose|rhino]]-[[Phagy|phagic]] [[eagle]], an [[I Ching]] [[calculator]] (to which everything calculated above the value of 4 is apparently 'a suffusion of yellow'), a god who gives his powers to a lawyer and an advertising executive in exchange for clean [[linen]], and an attractive American woman who gets angry when she can't get [[Pizza delivery|pizza delivered]] in London.

'''''The Longest Day''''' is a book by [[Cornelius Ryan]] published in 1959, telling the story of [[D-Day]], the [[Normandy landings|first day]] of the [[World War II]] [[invasion of Normandy]]. It includes details of [[Operation Deadstick]], the ''[[coup de main]]'' operation by [[Military glider|gliderborne troops]] to capture both [[Pegasus Bridge]] and [[Horsa Bridge]] before the main assault on the Normandy beaches.  It sold tens of millions of copies in eighteen different languages.&lt;ref name="cjr"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cjr.org/second_read/the_reporter_who_time_forgot.php?page=all | title= The Reporter Who Time Forgot | publisher=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] | date= May–June 2010 | author= Michael Shapiro| accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is not a dry military history, but rather a story about people, and reads at times like a novel. It is based on interviews with a cross-section of participants, including U.S., Canadian, British, French and German officers and civilians.

The book begins and ends in the village of [[La Roche-Guyon]]. The book refers to the village as being the most occupied village in occupied France and states that for each of the 543 inhabitants of [[La Roche-Guyon]] there were more than 3 German soldiers in the village and surrounding area. Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] commander-in-chief of Army Group B had his headquarters in the castle of the village which was the seat of the [[Duc de La Rochefoucauld]].

Ryan's book is divided into three parts: the first part is titled The Wait, the second part is named The Night and the third part is named The Day. The book includes a section on the casualties of D-Day and also lists the contributors including their service details on the day of the invasion and their occupations at the time the book was first published.

Researchers spent almost three years locating survivors of D-Day and over 3000 interviews were undertaken in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, France and Germany. 383 accounts of D Day were used in the text of the book.

Senior Allied officers who assisted the author included General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]], Lieutenant General [[James M. Gavin]], Lieutenant General Sir [[Frederick E. Morgan]] and General Sir [[Richard Nelson Gale]]. German officers who assisted with the book included Generaloberst [[Franz Halder]], Hauptmann [[Hellmuth Lang]] and General der Infanterie [[Günther Blumentritt]]. The author also used Allied and German post action reports, War diaries, histories and official records.

On 6 June 1965, the author published an article "More of The Longest Day" in ''Reader's Digest'' as a supplement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|title=Cornelius Ryan Collection of World War II Papers

|accessdate=2013-12-23}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornelius Ryan dedicated his book for all the men of D-Day.

The book takes its name from a comment made by [[Erwin Rommel]] to his aide Hauptmann Helmuth Lang on 22 April 1944: "...the first 24 hours of the invasion will be decisive...the fate of Germany depends on the outcome...for the Allies, as well as Germany, it will be the longest day."

''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' is also the name of a 1962 film based on the book, featuring many star actors.

'''''The Rules of Charity''''' is a 2005 play by the American [[playwright]] [[John Belluso]]. The play premiered on April 23, 2005 at the [[Magic Theatre]] in [[San Francisco]], California. It has since had an [[Off-Broadway]] run.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/theater/reviews/13rules.html?_r=0|title=A Caregiver Not in a Giving Mood|last=Genzlinger|first=Neil|date=2007-06-13|work=New York Times|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play focuses on a man named Monty with [[cerebral palsy]] who uses a wheelchair, and whose adult daughter takes care of him.

[[John Belluso]] - whose contemporaries included the playwright [[Tony Kushner]] - used a wheelchair himself. His wheelchair use was a result of a bone disease called [[Camurati–Engelmann disease]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shinn |first=Christopher |url=http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/10/20/what-john-belluso-taught-me-about-disability-christopher-shinn/ |title=What John Belluso Taught Me About Disability, Generosity, and Life |publisher=American Theatre |date=2015-10-20 |accessdate=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rules of Charity'', like most of Belluso's work, explores what it means to be [[Disability|disabled]] or [[Social exclusion|marginalized]] in modern American society. He was an advocate for writers, playwrights, and artists with disabilities&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.backstage.com/news/disabled-playwright-john-belluso-dies/|title=Disabled Playwright John Belluso Dies|last=Schou|first=Solvej|date=February 15, 2006|website=backstage|agency=Associated Press|access-date=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used his own personal experience to deepen and drive his own work. As a young playwright, Belluso worked with the [[New Dramatists]],&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newdramatists.org/who/alumni|title=Alumni Playwrights|last=|first=|date=2016|website=New Dramatists|publisher=New Dramatists|access-date=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; connecting with his fellow playwrights of the time and making an impression during his unfortunately short career that impacted many.

The [[Dramatists Play Service]] version of the published script contains, next to the character descriptions and play setting, a poem by [[Wallace Stevens]] entitled ''A Postcard from the Volcano.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/43432|title=A Postcard from the Volcano|last=Stevens|first=Wallace|date=1990|website=Poetry Foundation|publisher=|access-date=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem speaks to the leaving behind of the experience of an older generation, a generation that suffered and that the younger generation will know nothing about.

This speaks to the themes of the play as a whole, as it focuses heavily on [[familial relationship]]s, and the younger generation being so preoccupied with their own problems that they cannot see the long-suffering of the older generation.

==Plot summary==
''The Rules of Charity'' focuses on a middle-aged man named Monty, and his daughter Loretta. Monty has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, and Loretta, a grown woman, cares for him. The play focuses around their relationship, the anger and resentment that lives within their connection, as well as the love between them. The play also focuses on how one navigates our world when one is an outsider, whether that is because of one's ability or disability, sexuality, religion, or social class.

Structurally, ''The Rules of Charity'' is in a standard two-act dramatic structure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://playwriting.vcu.edu/structure.html|title=Structure of Two Act Plays|last=Toscan|first=Richard|date=2012|website=Playwrighting Seminars|publisher=Virginia Commonwealth University|access-date=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Act I taking place in the present day, and Act II taking place one year later. The play is also split up by named sections that divide up the action further, framed by a prologue and an epilogue.

=== Prologue: The Introduction of Cruelty ===
The play opens with Loretta at the end of her rope, in the apartment that she and her father share, having just slapped her father, knocking over his wheelchair. "Cruelty is a form of goodness", she tells him. Menacingly, but laced with the love that she has for her father, she tells him that she will only treat him with cruelty from that moment on.

=== Act One, Section 1: Apothetai (The Place of Exposure) ===
The next morning, Loretta and Monty are at home, things are normal again. LH, the superintendent of the building comes in with a bottle of scotch, celebrating his recent raise. Monty invites him to stay for dinner, and LH encourages Monty to try and leave his apartment in order to look for a job. Monty refuses, and it is revealed that Monty and LH are secret lovers. LH tells Monty that he has invited over the daughter of the building owner Paz, who is a documentary filmmaker. She wants to talk to Monty. Monty is unsure, but LH assures him that everything will be fine.

Later that evening, Loretta meets a dull man named Horace by a street corner. They flirt and he asks her out on a date, which she refuses.

The next morning, Paz arrives with LH at Monty and Loretta's apartment. Paz pitches her documentary to Monty - she wants to write about what she perceives as the enormous and dramatic struggle of the disabled. Monty is clearly far superior to her in intelligence, and does not take to her well. However, she offers him a large sum of money to be a part of her documentary, and so Monty promises LH that he will consider it. Monty and Loretta are left alone and share a brief moment of tenderness, it is also revealed that Loretta's mother, Monty's wife, is no longer living and that that day would have been her birthday.

Loretta returns to the street corner to invite Horace over to her apartment for dinner. Initially he is nervous about going to dinner, and says that he usually works until late at the fish factory. She promises him that she will give her father pills to fall asleep so that he can come over without Monty bothering them. He accepts, and she kisses him.

LH and Monty are alone, drinking in Loretta and Monty's apartment. They recount the tales of Greek Mythology that LH read about in books that Monty lent him. Monty describes to LH what the Apothetai was in ancient Greece - the place where disabled babies were left to die. LH is very moved, and asks Monty if he knew he was gay, even when he was married. Monty says that yes, he did. Loretta then enters and puts Monty to bed, giving him his pill that helps him sleep. Monty whispers to himself that he wants to go away with LH and let her live on her own, and in doing so, he throws himself from his bed and lands on the floor. Angry and exasperated, Loretta tells him that he can sleep on the floor.

=== Act One, Section 2: The Poor Laws ===
The following morning. Monty is sitting on the couch of his apartment while Paz prepares to begin shooting the documentary. LH and Loretta, one after the other, enter the apartment. They watch as Paz begins to interview Monty for the camera. Her questions offend Monty, as they obsess over what Paz determines to be the 'grotesque' aspect of Monty's disabled existence. She suggests that he ask her some questions in order to make them more comfortable around one another. When he is asking questions about her personal life, Paz reveals that she and LH are together. Monty did not know this and is blindsided. Unaware of Monty and LH's relationship, Paz continues to question Monty, pressing him on his sexuality and financial situation. Turning the questions once more back on her, Monty suggests to Paz that she make her film more about the overall concept of charity. He suggests that she structure her film around the origins of how disability caused societal isolation. She is disappointed, and when she once again asks to hear about his life story, he is enraged and asks her to leave his house. She does.

Once Paz leaves, Monty tells LH that he wants them to be together. LH responds saying that he doesn't want to be with Monty, both because he doesn't want to be gay and because he doesn't want to have to take care of him. LH breaks it off between them, leaving Monty in the apartment alone.

LH and Paz stand outside of the apartment building under a lamppost. LH has moved out of the building and is no longer the janitor there. He proposes marriage to Paz. She accepts.

Back in the apartment, Loretta has fed Monty four of his pills to make him sleep while she and Horace have dinner. They talk about their families and Loretta admits, while Horace sleeps, that she both loves and hates her father. Monty groggily hears her say all of this. Loretta and Horace exit to her bedroom to make love. Monty takes the pill bottle from his bedside table and slowly eats every pill.

=== Act Two, Section 3: The Baby, Or A Testimony of Dark Things ===
One year after the events of Act I, Loretta and Horace, and Monty are back in the apartment. Loretta has developed a habit of pretending to be pregnant by sticking a balloon under her shirt, but she tells Horace that they can't afford a real baby.

Later, on a street corner, Loretta, wearing the balloon as a fake pregnant belly, runs into Paz. Paz introduces herself by her real name, Joyce. She tells Loretta that she and LH (now known as Mr. Millicent) are married and are born-again Christians. Seemingly relieved to see Loretta, she asks if a publisher has published her father's journal. Loretta is surprised by this and answers that the journal is not published, that it is not even finished. Joyce offers Loretta money in exchange for her father's journal, for his story.

Back at the apartment, Loretta tries to convince Monty to give her his journal for money. He refuses, especially refusing to give his journal to LH. LH is seen desperately trying to read, but since he can't without Monty, he despairs. At the apartment once again, Horace comes home very drunk after having gotten in a bar fight. Loretta approaches him and tells him that they are going to pretend to be a happily married, pregnant couple in order to sell her father's journal to Joyce. She tells him that after they do so, he is going to leave the apartment and never come back, calling him a cripple who has made her life even worse.

=== Act Two, Section 4: Knot Stew ===
Loretta and Horace set up dinner at the apartment, nervous that everything will go well for the dinner with LH (now Mr. Millicent) where they will try to sell Monty's journal. Mr. Millicent arrives at dinner, appearing much changed from the last time Loretta, Horace, and Monty saw him. Monty arrives as well, and begins grilling Mr. Millicent on his latest reading material. Mr. Millicent has trouble keeping up with Monty, which makes Monty smug. Angry, Mr. Millicent reveals that he has come to dinner to ask for the pages in Monty's journal in which he wrote about their romantic relationship, claiming that those stories are lies. Loretta begs for charity, for money in exchange for the journal. Mr. Millicent declares that they are unworthy of charity and refuses Monty's journal, violently flipping over Monty's wheelchair in the process. In response, Horace slits Mr. Millicent's throat, killing him. He apologizes profusely as Mr. Millicent dies, with Monty and Loretta looking on.

=== Epilogue: The Swallows ===
Loretta and Monty sit on the floor, Loretta cradling Monty, who is hurt from his fall from his wheelchair. Horace has put Mr. Millicent's body in his car, and tells Loretta that he will drive away with it forever. He tells her to blame the murder all on him, and she agrees. Horace leaves, and Monty hands Loretta the last pages of his journal to read. She reads out loud the last passage from his journal, where he describes telling her, as a baby, that she will have to learn to swallow her pain. Monty dies in Loretta's arms. She smiles.

== Playwright ==
[[John Belluso]] (1969-2006) was a well-established young American playwright whose works focused on the life of people with disabilities in modern America, and how they navigated a world that was generally set against them. Belluso had [[Camurati–Engelmann disease|Camurati-Englemann Disease]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and used a wheelchair. He believed that disability created a perfect mindset for a person to have a yearning to make theatre - as someone who is often looked at and scrutinized by society, he felt that it was a natural feeling for a person to want to turn that mirror back on society, and he chose to do so by creating theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/10/20/what-john-belluso-taught-me-about-disability-christopher-shinn/|title=What John Belluso Taught Me About Disability, Generosity, and Life|last=Shinn|first=Christopher|date=2015-10-20|website=AMERICAN THEATRE|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rules of Charity'', like most of Belluso's work, explores what it means to be [[Disability|disabled]] or [[Social exclusion|marginalized]] in modern American society. Belluso was an [[advocate]] for writers, playwrights, and artists with disabilities,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and used his own personal experience to deepen and drive his own work.

As a young playwright, [[John Belluso]] worked with the [[New Dramatists]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; connecting with his fellow contemporary playwrights (for example, the playwright [[Tony Kushner]]) and making an impression during his unfortunately short career that impacted many.

The mascot of the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]] is [[Hodori]], a stylized tiger to represent Korean people.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=294761&amp;v=42|script-title=ko:호랑이 |trans-title=Horang-i (Tiger)|publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]]|language=Korean|accessdate=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarded by many as the divine spirit that guards the West, people in Korea consider the [[white tiger]] as a sacred creature in local folklore.

A tiger that has overcome trials and tribulations and understands the world is known to turn white, becoming a white tiger. Although it is a sacred creature that doesn’t harm people, it becomes angry when the ruler of the country conducts evil and inhumane deeds. Therefore, it has been told that powerful people become humble and rich people become generous when a white tiger appears.

As such, in Korean history and culture, a tiger is regarded as a guardian that drives away evil spirit and a sacred creature that brings good luck – the symbol of courage and absolute power.

The oldest historical record about the tiger can be found in the myth of [[Dangun]], the legendary founding father of [[Gojoseon]], told in the Samguk Yusa, or the Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms. According to the myth, a bear and a tiger wished to become human beings. The bear turned into a woman by observing the commandments to eat only mugwort and garlic for 100 days in the cave. But the tiger couldn’t endure the ordeal and ran off, failing to realize its wish.

There are 635 historical records about tigers in the [[Annals of the Joseon Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=사냥-전통수렵 방법과 도구 |url=http://www.culturecontent.com/content/contentView.do?search_div=CP_THE&amp;search_div_id=CP_THE001&amp;cp_code=cp0419&amp;index_id=cp04190009&amp;content_id=cp041900090001&amp;search_left_menu= |website=문화콘텐츠닷컴 |accessdate=14 August 2018 |language=ko |quote=『조선왕조실록』에 실린 호랑이 관련 기사는 모두 635건에 이른다.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of a tiger that began from a myth can be also found in daily life as well. For example, the 19th-century painting named
“Sansindo” depicts the guardian spirit of a mountain leaning against a tiger or riding on the back of the animal. The animal is also known to do the errands for the mountain’s guardian spirit which is known to wish for peace and the well-being of the village. So, the tiger was ordered by the spiritual guardian of the mountain to give protection and wish for peace in the village. People drew such paintings and hung them in the shrine built in the mountain of the village where memorial rituals were performed regularly. In Buddhism, there is also a shrine that keeps the painting of the guardian spirit of the mountain. Called “Sansintaenghwa”, it is depiction of the guardian spirit of the mountain and a tiger.

The painting “Jakhodo” is about a magpie and a tiger. The letter “jak” means magpie; “ho” means tiger; and “do” means painting. Since the work is known to keep away evil influence, there is a tradition to hang the art piece in the house in the first month of the [[Korean calendar|lunar calendar]]. On a branch of a green pine tree sits a magpie and the tiger, with a humorous expression, looks up at the bird. The tiger in “Jakhodo” doesn’t look anything like a strong creature with power and authority. Here again is Gu.{{non sequitur|date=February 2018}}

''Kkachi horangi'', paintings depicting magpies and tigers, was a prominent motif in the ''[[minhwa]]'' folk art of the Joseon period. In ''kkachi horangi'' paintings, the tiger, which is intentionally given a ridiculous and stupid appearance (hence its nickname "idiot tiger" 바보호랑이), represents authority and the aristocratic [[yangban]], while the dignified magpie represents the common man. Hence, ''kkachi horangi'' paintings of magpies and tigers were a satire of the hierarchical structure of Joseon's feudal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=까치호랑이|url=http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/kr/topic/%EA%B9%8C%EC%B9%98%ED%98%B8%EB%9E%91%EC%9D%B4/6565|website=Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture|publisher=National Folk Museum of Korea|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=KOREA Magazine March 2017|date=2017|publisher=Korean Culture and Information Service|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3M-DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They can be also found around the royal tombs. In front of the burial mound stands the stone tiger sculptures. People believed that tigers also safeguarded the tomb, the permanent home for the dead. The sacredness of the tiger was also utilized for holding rituals that pray for rain. According to the historical records of the early Joseon era, the head of a tiger was offered as the sacrificial offering when performing a ritual praying for rain while Joseon was under the reign of kings such as [[Taejong]], [[Sejong]], [[Munjong of Joseon|Munjong]], and [[Danjong]].

{{VG Industry}}
The '''video game industry''' is the [[economic sector]] involved in the [[Video game development|development]], marketing, and [[Video game monetization|monetization of video games]]. It encompasses dozens of [[job]] disciplines and its component parts employ thousands of people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Zackariasson, P. and Wilson, T.L. eds. (2012). ''The Video Game Industry: Formation, Present State, and Future''. New York: Routledge.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The computer and video game industry has grown from focused markets to mainstream. They took in about [[United States dollar|US$]]9.5 billion in the US in 2007, 11.7 billion in 2008, and 25.1 billion in 2010 ([[Entertainment Software Association|ESA]] annual report).

Modern [[personal computer]]s owe many advancements and innovations to the game industry: [[sound card]]s, [[graphics card]]s and [[3D graphic accelerator]]s, faster [[CPU]]s, and dedicated co-processors like [[PhysX]] are a few of the more notable improvements.

[[Sound card]]s were developed for addition of digital-quality sound to games and only later improved for music and [[audiophile]]s.&lt;ref name="sndhist"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alldidigames.com/video-games-industry-infographics/ | publisher=Didi Games | work=Research on Video Games | author=Bob Johnstone | title=Didi Games | accessdate=April 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, graphics cards were developed for more colors.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; Later, graphic cards were developed for [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs) and games; GUIs drove the need for high resolution, and games began using 3D acceleration.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; They also are one of the only pieces of hardware to allow multiple hookups (such as with [[Scan Line Interleave|SLI]] or [[ATI CrossFire|CrossFire]] graphics cards).&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; CD- and DVD-ROMs were developed for mass distribution of media in general; however the ability to store more information on cheap easily distributable media was instrumental in driving their ever-higher speeds.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt;

== Game industry value chain ==
Ben Sawyer of Digitalmill observes that the game industry [[value chain]] is made up of six connected and distinctive layers:
# Capital and publishing layer: involved in paying for development of new titles and seeking returns through licensing of the titles.
# Product and talent layer: includes [[Video game developer|developers]], [[video game designer|designers]] and [[game artist|artists]], who may be working under individual contracts or as part of in-house development teams.
# Production and tools layer: generates content [[game tool|production tools]], game development [[Game Middleware|middleware]], [[Game engine|customizable game engines]], and production management tools.
# Distribution layer: or the "[[video game publisher|publishing]]" industry, involved in generating and marketing catalogs of games for retail and online distribution.
# Hardware (or Virtual Machine or Software Platform) layer: or the providers of the underlying platform, which may be console-based, accessed through online media, or accessed through mobile devices such as [[smartphones]]. This layer now includes network infrastructure and non-hardware platforms such as virtual machines (e.g. Java or Flash), or software platforms such as browsers or even further Facebook, etc.
# End-users layer: or the users/players of the games.&lt;ref name="newmedia"&gt;

== Disciplines ==
The game industry employs those experienced in other traditional businesses, but some have experience tailored to the game industry. Some of the disciplines specific to the game industry include: [[game programmer]], [[game designer]], [[level designer]], [[game producer]], [[game artist]] and [[game tester]]. Most of these professionals are employed by [[video game developer]]s or [[video game publisher]]s. However, many [[hobby]]ists also produce computer games and sell them commercially.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Game developers and publishers sometimes employ those with extensive or long-term experience within the [[Mod (video gaming)|modding]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://uncommonculture.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2965/2526#36&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1940s–1960s ===

{{main|Early history of video games|Early mainframe games}}
Prior to the 1970s, there was no significant commercial aspect of the video game industry, but many advances in computing would set the stage for the birth of the industry.

Many early publicly-available interactive computer-based game machines used or other mechanisms to mimic a display; while technically not "video games", they had elements of interactivity between the player and the machine. Some examples of these included the 1940 "Nimatron", an electromagentic relay-based [[Nim]]-playing device designed by [[Edward Condon]] and built by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] for the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]],&lt;ref name="Priest"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/the-priesthood-at-play-computer-games-in-the-1950s/|title=The Priesthood At Play: Computer Games in the 1950s |work=They Create Worlds|last=Smith|first=Alexander|date=2014-01-22|accessdate=2015-12-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172058/https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/the-priesthood-at-play-computer-games-in-the-1950s/|archivedate=2015-12-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bertie the Brain]]'', an arcade game of [[tic-tac-toe]], built by [[Josef Kates]] for the 1950 [[Canadian National Exhibition]],&lt;ref name="CNE"&gt;{{cite news|first=Marlene|last=Simmons|title=Bertie the Brain programmer heads science council |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rKYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pe0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=916,3790974&amp;dq=josef-kates&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=1975-10-09|page=17|accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nimrod (computing)|Nimrod]] created by engineering firm [[Ferranti]] for the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Replay: The History of Video Games]]|last=Donovan|first=Tristan|publisher=Yellow Ant|date=2010-04-20|isbn=978-0-9565072-0-4|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of [[cathode ray tube]]&amp;mdash;the core technology behind televisions&amp;mdash;created several of the first true video games. In 1947 Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann filed a patent for a "cathode ray tube amusement device". Their game, which uses a cathode ray tube hooked to an oscilloscope display, challenges players to fire a gun at target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofplay.org/about/icheg/video-game-history/timeline |title=Video Game History Timeline &amp;#124; The Strong |publisher=Museumofplay.org |date= |accessdate=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 1950s and 1960s, with mainframe computers becoming available to campus colleges, students and others started to develop games that could be played at terminals that accessed the mainframe. One of the first known examples is ''[[Spacewar!]]'', developed by Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz, [[Steve Russell (computer scientist)|Steve Russell]], and Wayne Wiitanen.&lt;ref name="Space"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/08/07/one-two-three-four-i-declare-a-space-war/|title=One, Two, Three, Four I Declare a Space War|work=They Create Worlds|last=Smith|first=Alexander|date=2014-08-07|accessdate=2015-12-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172136/https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/08/07/one-two-three-four-i-declare-a-space-war/|archivedate=2015-12-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of easy-to-program languages like [[BASIC]] for mainframes allowed for more simplistic games to be developed.

The early part of the decade saw the rise of [[8-bit]] home computing, and [[Homebrew (video games)|home-made games]], especially in Europe (with the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Commodore 64]]) and Asia (with the [[NEC PC-8801|NEC PC-88]] and [[MSX]]). This time also saw the rise of [[video game journalism]], which was later expanded to include [[covermount]]ed cassettes and CDs.
In 1983, the [[North American video game crash of 1983|North American industry crashed]] due to the production of too many badly developed games (quantity over quality), resulting in the fall of the North American industry. The industry would eventually be revitalized by the release of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], which resulted in the home console market being dominated by Japanese companies such as [[Nintendo]],&lt;ref name="newmedia" /&gt; while a professional European computer game industry also began taking shape with companies such as [[Ocean Software]] and [[Gremlin Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ystop100.html|title=World of Spectrum - Archive - YS Top 100|work=worldofspectrum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the decade saw the rise of the [[Game Boy]] handheld system. In 1987, Nintendo lost a legal challenge against [[Blockbuster Entertainment]], which enabled games rentals in the same way as movies.

=== 1990s ===
[[File:PlayStation-SCPH-1000-with-Controller.png|thumb|right|The [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] was the most popular gaming console of the fifth generation, which saw the common adoption of CD media.]]
{{see also|History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|History of video game consoles (sixth generation)}}

The 1990s saw advancements in game related technology. Among the significant advancements were:
* The widespread adoption of [[compact disc|CD]]-based storage and software distribution
* Widespread adoption of [[graphical user interface|GUI]]-based [[operating system]]s, such as the series of [[Amiga OS]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS]]
* Advancement in 3D graphics technology, as [[Graphics processing unit|3D graphic cards]] became widely adopted, with [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] now the ''[[de facto]]'' standard for video game visual presentation
* Continuing advancement of [[CPU]] speed and sophistication
* Miniaturisation of hardware, and mobile phones, which enabled [[mobile gaming]]
* The emergence of the internet, which in the latter part of the decade enabled online co-operative play and [[competitive gaming]]

Aside from technology, in the early part of the decade, [[brand licensing|licensed]] games became more popular,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fahs |first=Travis |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/896/896893p1.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Madden - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=August 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hurby |first=Patrick |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=100805/madden |title=ESPN - OTL: The Franchise - E-ticket |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did video game sequels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLaughlin |first=Rus |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/954/954426p2.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Street Fighter - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=July 7, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s ===
{{see also|History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|History of video game consoles (seventh generation)}}

In 2000s, the video game industry is a juggernaut of development; profit still drives technological advancement which is then used by other industry sectors. Technologies such as [[Smartphones]], [[virtual reality]] and [[augmented reality]] are major drivers for game hardware and gameplay development. Though maturing, the video game industry was still very volatile, with third-party video game developers quickly cropping up, and just as quickly, going out of business.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Nevertheless, many [[casual game]]s and [[indie game]]s were developed and become popular and successful, such as ''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]'' and ''[[Limbo (video game)|Limbo]]''. Game development for mobile phones (such as [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices) and social networking sites emerged. For example, a [[Facebook]] game developer, [[Zynga]], has raised in excess of $300 million.{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/15/zynga-takes-180-million-venture-round-cue-russian-mafia-jokes/ |title=Zynga Takes $180 Million Venture Round From DST, Others (Cue Russian Mafia Jokes) |publisher=TechCrunch |date=December 15, 2009 |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010s ===

Though not the main driving force, [[independent video games|indie games]] continue to have a significant impact on the industry, with sales of some of these titles such as ''[[Spelunky]]'', ''[[Fez]]'', ''[[Don't Starve]]'', ''[[Castle Crashers]]'', and ''[[Minecraft]]'', exceeding millions of [[United States dollar|dollars]] and over a million users.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurial-insights.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneurial-insights.com/gaming-industry-introduction/|title=The Gaming Industry – An Introduction|work=Entrepreneurial Insights}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|date=February 2017}} The 2010s have seen a larger shift to casual and [[mobile gaming]]; in 2016, the mobile gaming market is estimated to have taken $38 billion in revenues, compared to $6 billion for the console market and $33 billion for personal computing gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-10-24-welcome-to-the-new-era-games-as-media | title = Welcome to the New Era: Games as Media | first = Joost | last = van Dreunen | date = October 24, 2016 | accessdate = October 31, 2016 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Games centered on [[virtual reality]] and [[augmented reality]] equipment also arose during this decade. As of 2014, newer game companies arose that vertically integrate live operations and publishing such as crowdfunding and other direct-to-consumer efforts, rather than relying on a traditional publishers, and some of these have grown to substantial size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/business-startup-development-and-more/50e5d9379521 |title=The Future of Games and How to Stop It |last1=Radoff |first1=Jon |last2= |first2= |date=February 10, 2014 |website=medium.com |publisher=medium.com |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spurred by some initial events in the late 2000s, [[eSports]] centered around professional players in organized competitions and leagues for prize money, grew greatly over this decade, drawing hundreds of millions of viewers and reaching nearly $500 million in revenue by 2016 and expected to break $1 billion by 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/29/sport/esports-revolution-revenue-audience-growth/index.html | title = ESports: Global revenue expected to smash $1 billion by 2019 | first = Don | last=  Riddell | date = May 29, 2016 | accessdate = January 16, 2018  | work = [[CNN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics ==
Early on, development costs were minimal, and video games could be quite profitable. Games developed by a single programmer, or by a small team of programmers and artists, could sell hundreds of thousands of copies each. Many of these games only took a few months to create, so developers could release multiple titles per year. Thus, publishers could often be generous with benefits, such as [[royalties]] on the games sold. Many early game publishers started from this economic climate, such as [[Origin Systems]], [[Sierra Entertainment]], [[Capcom]], [[Activision]] and [[Electronic Arts]].

As computing and graphics power increased, so too did the size of development teams, as larger staffs were needed to address the ever-increasing technical and design complexities. The larger teams consist of programmers, artists, game designers, and producers. Their salaries can range anywhere from $50,000 to $120,000 generating large labor costs for firms producing videogames&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfishgames.com/blog/video-gaming-industry-numbers-by-region/|title=Top Gaming Studios, Schools &amp; Salaries|work=Big Fish Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can often take between one and three years to develop. Now budgets typically reach millions of dollars despite the growing popularity of [[Game Middleware|middleware]] and pre-built [[game engine]]s.  In addition to growing development costs, marketing budgets have grown dramatically, sometimes consisting of two to three times of the cost of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Superannuation|title=How Much Does It Cost To Make A Big Video Game?|url=http://kotaku.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-a-big-video-game-1501413649|website=Kotaku|publisher=Gawker Media|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game development team has to select a profitable and suitable method [[Video game monetization|to sell or earn money from]] the finished game. Traditionally, the game monetization method is to sell hard copies in retail store. Now some developers are turning to alternative production and distribution methods, such as [[digital distribution|online distribution]], to reduce costs and increase revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kain|first1=Erik|title=Why Digital Distribution Is The Future And GameStop Is Not: Taking The Long View On Used Games|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/05/30/why-digital-distribution-is-the-future-and-gamestop-is-not-taking-the-long-view-on-used-games/|website=Forbes|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the video game industry has a major impact on the economy through the sales of major systems and games such as ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'', which took in over $650 [[United States dollar|USD]] million of sales in the game's first five days and which set a five-day global record for a movie, book or videogame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/278-call-of-duty-black-ops-sets-record-for-activision "Call of Duty: Black Ops" sets record for Activision"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125022802/http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/278-call-of-duty-black-ops-sets-record-for-activision |date=January 25, 2011 }}.

The industry wide adoption of high-definition graphics during the seventh generation of consoles greatly increased development teams' sizes and reduced the number of [[Triple A (gaming)|high-budget, high-quality titles]] under development. In 2013 [[Richard Hilleman]] of Electronic Arts estimated that only 25 developers were working on such titles for the eighth console generation, compared to 125 at the same point in the seventh generation-console cycle seven or eight years earlier.&lt;ref name="vgchartz20130706"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vgchartz.com/article/251108/ea-aaa-development-in-decline/ | title=EA: AAA Development in Decline | work=VGChartz | date=July 6, 2013 | accessdate=July 8, 2013 | author=D'Angelo, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retail ===

The games industry's shift from brick and mortar retail to digital downloads led to a severe sales decline at video game retailers such as [[GameStop]], following other media retailers superseded by Internet delivery, such as [[Blockbuster (company)|Blockbuster]], [[Tower Records (music retailer)|Tower Records]], and [[Virgin Megastores]]. GameStop diversified its services by purchasing chains that repair wireless devices and expanding its trade-in program through which customers trade used games for credit towards new games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Wingfield |first1=Nick |title=As Downloads Take Over, a Turning Point for the Video Game Industry |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2015-12-20 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/technology/as-downloads-take-over-a-turning-point-for-the-video-game-industry.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company began to produce its own merchandise and games. In Britain, the games retailer [[Game (retailer)|Game]] revamped its stores so customers would spend time playing games there. It built a gaming arena for events and tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=GAME launches Belong - is this the future of video games retail? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-12-16 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-12-15-game-launches-belong-is-this-the-future-of-video-games-retail |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift to digital marketplaces, especially for smartphones, led to an influx of inexpensive and disposable titles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Suellentrop |first1=Chris |last2=Totilo |first2=Stephen |title=Video Game Retail Sales Decline Despite New Hits |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-10-03 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/arts/video-games/video-game-retail-sales-decline-despite-new-hits.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as lower engagement among gamers who otherwise purchased new games from retail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=What's going wrong at UK games retail? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-11-21 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-21-whats-going-wrong-at-games-retail |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- more in this source --&gt; Customers also shifted away from the tradition of buying games on their first day of release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=Is the industry's obsession with Day One coming to an end? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-11-08 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-07-is-the-industrys-obsession-with-day-one-coming-to-an-end |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publishers often funded trade-in deals to encourage consumers to purchase new games. Trade-in customers at the Australia retailer Game would purchase twice the games per year as non-trade-in customers. The sale of pre-owned games kept retailers in business, and composed about a third of Game's revenue. Retailers also saved on the UK's value-added tax, which only taxed the retailer's profit on pre-owned games, rather than the full sale on regular games. The former trade-in retail executives behind the trade-in price comparison site Trade In Detectives estimated that the United Kingdom's trade-in industry was about a third of the size of its new games business.{{r|Eurogamer: trade-in myths}} They figured that sites such as [[eBay]], which convert used games into cash, compose about a quarter of the UK's trade-in market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parfitt |first1=Ben |title=Pre-owned price comparison site Trade In Detectives goes live |work=[[MCV UK]] |date=2013-08-07 |url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/pre-owned-price-comparison-site-trade-in-detectives-goes-live/0119776 |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but do not keep the credit within the industry. While consumers might appear to receive better offers on these sites, they also take about 15 percent of the selling price in fees. Alternatively, some retailers will match the trade-in values offered by their competitors. Microsoft's original plan for the Xbox One attempted to translate trade-in deals for the digital marketplace, with a database of product licenses that shops would be able to resell with publisher permission, though the plan was poorly received or poorly sold.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: trade-in myths"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Purchese |first1=Robert |title=Myth-busting the murky world of video game trade-ins |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2013-12-18 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-12-03-myth-busting-the-murky-world-of-video-game-trade-ins |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==
Video game industry practices are similar to those of other entertainment industries (e.g., the [[recording industry|music recording industry]]), but the video game industry in particular has been accused of treating its development talent poorly. This promotes independent development, as developers leave to form new companies and projects. In some notable cases, these new companies grow large and impersonal, having adopted the business practices of their forebears, and ultimately perpetuate the cycle.

However, unlike the music industry, where modern technology has allowed a fully professional product to be created extremely inexpensively by an independent musician, modern games require increasing amounts of manpower and equipment. This dynamic makes [[video game publisher|publishers]], who fund the [[video game developer|developers]], much more important than in the music industry.

=== Breakaways ===
In the video game industry, it is common for developers to leave their current studio and start their own. A particularly famous case is the "original" independent developer [[Activision]], founded by former [[Atari]] developers. Activision grew to become the world's second largest game publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10224904/activision-aims-for-sweet-spot.html|title=Activision Aims for Sweet Spot|last=Wolverton|first=Troy|date=May 24, 2005|publisher=TheStreet.com|accessdate=March 30, 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ffLSaAf0?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10224904/activision-aims-for-sweet-spot.html|archivedate=March 30, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mean time, many of the original developers left to work on other projects. For example, founder [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]] left Activision to start another video game development company, [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] (now [[Atari]] née [[Infogrames]]).

Activision was popular among developers for giving them credit in the packaging and title screens for their games, while Atari disallowed this practice. As the video game industry took off in the mid-1980s, many developers faced the more distressing problem of working with fly-by-night or unscrupulous publishers that would either fold unexpectedly or run off with the game profits.

=== Piracy ===
The industry claims [[software piracy]] to be a big problem, and take measures to counter this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Valjalo |first=David |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/3ds-will-fight-piracy-firmware |title=3DS Will Fight Piracy With Firmware &amp;#124; Edge Magazine |publisher=Next-gen.biz |date=October 4, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EN2nGrc6?url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/3ds-will-fight-piracy-firmware/ |archivedate=February 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Digital rights management]] have proved to be the most unpopular with gamers, as a measure to counter piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7972677.stm |title=Technology &amp;#124; EA 'dumps DRM' for next Sims game |publisher=BBC News |date=March 31, 2009 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most popular and effective strategy to counter piracy is to change the business model to [[Freemium]], where gamers pay for their in-game needs or service. Strong server-side security is required for this, to properly distinguish authentic transactions from [[Cheating in video games|hacked]] (faked) transactions.

=== Creative control ===
On various Internet forums, some gamers have expressed disapproval of publishers having creative control since publishers are more apt to follow short-term market trends rather than invest in risky but potentially lucrative ideas. On the other hand, publishers may know better than developers what consumers want. The relationship between video game developers and publishers parallels the relationship between [[Recording Artists' Coalition|recording artists]] and [[RIAA|record labels]] in many ways. But unlike the [[music industry]], which has seen flat or declining sales in the early 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20021010.html|title=Global sales of recorded music down 9.2% in the first half of 2002 from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20031001.html|title=Global sales of recorded music down 10.9% in the first half of 2003 from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20051003.html|title=Digital sales triple to 6% of industry retail revenues as global music market falls 1.9% (2005) from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the video game industry continues to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2132172920070621|title=Video game industry growth still strong: study|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, personal computers have made the independent development of music almost effortless, while the gap between an independent game developer and the product of a fully financed one grows larger.

In the [[computer game]]s industry, it is easier to create a startup, resulting in many successful companies. The [[video game console|console]] games industry is a more closed one, and a game developer must have up to three licenses from the [[console manufacturer]]:
# A license to develop games for the console
# The publisher must have a license to publish games for the console
# A separate license for each game

In addition, the developer must usually buy development systems from the console manufacturer in order to even develop a game for consideration, as well as obtain concept approval for the game from the console manufacturer. Therefore, the developer normally has to have a publishing deal in place before starting development on a game project, but in order to secure a publishing deal, the developer must have a track record of console development, something which few startups will have.

=== Alternatives ===
An alternative method for publishing video games is to self-publish using the [[shareware]] or [[Open-source software|open source]] model over the [[Internet]].

=== Gaming conventions ===
[[Gaming convention]]s are an important showcase of the industry. The major annual gaming conventions include [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] (Germany), the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in [[Los Angeles]] (USA),&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|title=E3 is Obsolete, But it Doesn't Matter|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2012/06/08/e3-is-obsolete-but-it-doesnt-matter/|publisher=Forbes|date=June 8, 2012|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Penny Arcade Expo]], and [[:Category:Video game conventions|others]].

[[Image:Gamescom 2009 - Koelnmesse Südeingang (5473).jpg|thumb|The [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]], the major gaming fair by attendance.]]
[[Gaming convention]]s are an important showcase of the industry. The annual [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] (Germany) is a major expo for video games. The [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in [[Los Angeles]] (USA) is also of global importance, but is an event for industry insiders only.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;

Other notable conventions and trade fairs include [[Tokyo Game Show]] (Japan), [[Brasil Game Show]] (Brazil), [[EB Games Expo]] (Australia), [[Russian Game Developers Conference|KRI]] (Russia), [[China Digital Entertainment Expo &amp; Conference|ChinaJoy]] (China) and the annual [[Game Developers Conference]]. Some publishers, developers and technology producers also have their own regular conventions, with [[BlizzCon]], [[QuakeCon]], [[Nvision]] and the [[X (Xbox show)|X shows]] being prominent examples.

=== Africa ===

Video gaming is still in its infancy throughout the African continent, but due to the continent's young population and increasing technological literacy, the sector is growing rapidly. African countries such as [[video gaming in South Africa|South Africa]], [[video gaming in Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[video gaming in Kenya|Kenya]] have been making rapid advances in [[mobile gaming|mobile game development]], both within their country and internationally,&lt;ref name="Africa top 10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itnewsafrica.com/2013/10/top-10-african-game-developers/|title=Top 10 African game developers|publisher=''[[IT News Africa]]''|last=Fripp|first=Charlie|date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but due to limited funding and a market over-crowded with western games, success has thus far been minimal.&lt;ref name="Mail &amp; Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mgafrica.com/article/2014-12-02-things-africa-will-be-famous-for-in-the-next-10-15-years|title=Africa 2030, the next 25 years: From video games, eco-buildings, robotics, and cycling|publisher=''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]] Africa''|last=Spooner|first=Samantha|date=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year, this industry generates billions of dollars and thousands of jobs in the Montreal area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourisme-montreal.org/meetings/2015/01/20/business-sectors/|title=What are the leading business sectors in Montréal?

The ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' series, along with the ''[[Tom Clancy]]'' series have all been produced in Canada and have achieved worldwide success. For consumers, the largest video games convention in Canada is the Enthusiast Gaming Live Expo (EGLX).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin Carignan |url=https://www.destructoid.com/dtoid-is-hosting-canada-s-largest-gaming-event-eglx-returns-march-9-11-2018-469022.phtml |title=Dtoid is hosting Canada's largest gaming event!

{{main|Video gaming in Germany}}

[[Germany]] has the largest video games market in Europe, with revenues of $4.1&amp;nbsp;billion forecast for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newzoo.com/insights/rankings/top-100-countries-by-game-revenues/|title=Top 100 Countries By Game Revenues|last=|first=|date=January 2017|website=newzoo.com|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] is Europe's largest gaming expo.

One of the earliest internationally successful video game companies was [[Gütersloh]]-based [[Rainbow Arts]] (founded in 1984) who were responsible for publishing the popular ''[[Turrican]]'' series of games. The [[Anno (series)|Anno series]] and [[The Settlers|The Settlers series]] are globally popular strategy game franchises since the 1990s. The [[Gothic series]], [[SpellForce: The Order of Dawn|SpellForce]] and [[Risen (video game)|Risen]] are established RPG franchises. The [[X (game series)|X series]] by [[Egosoft]] is the best-selling space simulation. The [[FIFA Manager (video game series)|FIFA Manager series]] was also developed in Germany. The German action game [[Spec Ops: The Line]] (2012) was successful in the markets and received largely positive reviews. One of the most famed titles to come out of Germany is ''[[Far Cry]]'' (2004) by [[Frankfurt]]-based [[Crytek]], who also produced the topseller ''[[Crysis]]'' and its sequels later.

Other well-known current and former developers from Germany include [[Ascaron]], [[Blue Byte]], [[Deck13 Interactive|Deck13]], [[EA Phenomic|Phenomic]], [[Piranha Bytes]], [[Radon Labs|Radon]], [[Related Designs|Related]], [[Spellbound Entertainment|Spellbound]] and [[Yager Development]]. Publishers include [[Deep Silver]] ([[Koch Media]]), [[dtp entertainment]], [[Kalypso Media|Kalypso]] and [[Nintendo|Nintendo Europe]]. [[Bigpoint Games]], [[Gameforge]], [[Goodgame Studios]] and [[Wooga]] are among the world's leading browser game and social network game developers/distributors.

=== Japan ===
{{main|Video gaming in Japan}}
[[File:Nintendo office.jpg|thumb|right|Headquarters of [[Nintendo]] in [[Kyoto]], Japan, 2006.]]
The [[Japan]]ese video game industry is markedly different from the industry in North America, Europe and Australia.

&lt;!-- Generally, games have a greater [[market share]] of total entertainment in Japan than in the West.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} --&gt;
Japanese companies have created some of the largest and most lucrative titles ever made, such as the ''[[Mario]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Metal Gear]]'', ''[[Pokémon]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series of games.

&lt;!-- [[Video arcade|Video game arcades]] are still relatively popular in Japan; for every [[arcade game]] released in the US, nine are released in [[Japan]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The history of the Japanese arcade is very significant in the story of the decline of the American arcade, and in the shape of [[game design]] in general. --&gt;
In recent years, [[video game console|consoles]] and arcade games have both been overtaken by downloadable [[free-to-play]] games on the [[PC game|PC]] and [[Mobile game|mobile]] platforms.&lt;ref name=economist12&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan fights back|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21566696-two-japanese-firms-are-challenging-world-new-kind-video-game-japan-fights-back|publisher=The Economist|date=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=capcom_marketdata&gt;{{cite web|title=Market Data|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/market.html|publisher=[[Capcom]]|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The structure and culture of a Japanese game developer is different from a western one. Throughout the history of Japanese game design, many developers have seen fit to remain mostly anonymous, even using pseudonyms to a large degree in video game credits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Also, the division in labor for video game development is different. For example, Japanese game design teams had a dedicated [[game designer|designer]] (which they called a "director") much earlier than American design teams adopted the practice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
Secondly, Japanese game designers throughout history generally had far more people working on a particular game than a comparable western design team. For example, ''[[Street Fighter 2]]'' (1992), a Japanese title, had almost one artist working on every character in the game, plus two programmers and a musician, with the result being a team of twenty or more people.  ''[[Mortal Kombat (video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1992), a comparable American title, was developed by four people: a [[game programmer|programmer]], an [[artist]], a [[musician]], and a background artist.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} --&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
{{main|Video gaming in the United Kingdom}}

The [[United Kingdom|UK]] industry is the third largest in the World in terms of developer success and sales of hardware and software by country alone but fourth behind Canada in terms of people employed.&lt;ref name="networkworld1"/&gt; The size of the UK game industry is comparable to its film or music industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-04-04-view-from-the-tower|title=The View From the Tower|publisher=gamesindustry.biz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years some of the studios have become defunct or been purchased by larger companies such as ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'' developer, [[Media Molecule]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/03/02/media-molecule-officially-joins-the-playstation-family/ |title=Media Molecule Officially Joins The PlayStation Family – PlayStation.Blog.Europe |publisher=Blog.eu.playstation.com |date=March 2, 2010 |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Codemasters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hinkle |first=David |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/04/05/reliance-big-entertainment-acquires-50-stake-in-codemasters |title=Reliance Big Entertainment acquires 50% stake in Codemasters |publisher=Joystiq |date=April 5, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is home to some of the world's most successful video game franchises, such as ''[[Tomb Raider]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'', ''[[Fable (video game series)|Fable]]'', ''[[Colin McRae: Dirt|Colin McRae Dirt]]'' and ''[[Total War (series)|Total War]]''.

The country also went without tax relief until March 21, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henderson |first=Rik |url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/44996/budget-2012-tax-relief-video-games |title=UK tax relief break |date=March 21, 2012 |accessdate= March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the British government changed its mind on tax relief for UK developers, which without, meant most of the talented development within the UK may move overseas for more profit, along with parents of certain video game developers which would pay for having games developed in the UK. The industry trade body TIGA estimates that it will increase the games development sector's contribution to UK GDP by £283 million, generate £172 million in new and protected tax receipts to HM Treasury, and could cost just £96 million over five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Post comment Name Email Address Comments |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-06/22/game-industry-tax-relief-plans-are-shelved |title=Game industry tax relief plans are shelved |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=June 22, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625151807/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-06/22/game-industry-tax-relief-plans-are-shelved |archivedate=June 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the tax relief was introduced there was a fear that the UK games industry could fall behind other leading game industries around the world such as France and Canada, of which Canada overtook the UK in terms of job numbers in the industry in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Canada overtakes UK |url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/34406/Canada-overtakes-UK-industry-workforce-tally |date=March 31, 2012 |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
[[Magnavox]] is credited for releasing the first [[video game console]], the [[Magnavox Odyssey|Odyssey]]. [[Activision]] was the first developer to create independent/third-party video games. Once the fastest-growing American company, [[Atari]] crashed in spectacular fashion, resulting in the [[North American video game crash of 1983]]. This resulted in the domination of the Japanese video game industry worldwide throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

====Companies====
The U.S. is home to major game development companies such as [[Activision Blizzard]] (''[[Call of Duty]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]''), [[Electronic Arts]] (''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'', ''[[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]]'', ''[[Mass Effect]]''), and [[Take-Two Interactive]] ([[Civilization (series)|Civilization]], [[NBA 2K (series)|''NBA 2K'' series]], ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]''). [[ZeniMax Media]] (''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'', ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'') is the world's largest privately held video game company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytech.com/Zenimax+Claims+Carmack+Stole+Oculus+VR+Facebook+Barks+Back/article34869.htm|title=Zenimax Claims Carmack Stole Oculus VR, Facebook Barks Back|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niantic, Inc.|Niantic]] (''[[Ingress (video game)|Ingress]]'', ''[[Pokémon Go]]'') is a notable mobile game developer.

[[Valve Corporation]] operates [[Steam (software)|Steam]], the largest computer gaming platform, with an active user base (~125 million) that rivals the combined user bases of the current console generation (~150 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgchartz.com/|title=VGChartz}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not specifically focused on games, the largest mobile gaming platforms are operated by [[Google]] ([[Google Play]]), and [[Apple Inc.]] ([[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]), with the majority of mobile revenue coming from Asia.&lt;ref name=idcannie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.appannie.com/app-annie-idc-portable-gaming-report-2013-q2/|author=App Annie, IDC|title=App Annie &amp; IDC Portable Gaming Report Q2 2013: iOS &amp; Google Play Game Revenue 4x Higher Than Gaming-Optimized Handhelds}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]] operates [[Xbox]], the only major game console hardware franchise not controlled by a Japanese company.

[[Intel]] and [[Nvidia]] are the largest makers of PC graphics chips. [[Advanced Micro Devices]] has become the most important console [[Microprocessor|processor]] vendor, with all three of the [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|eighth generation home consoles]] using AMD [[graphics processing unit|GPU]]s, and two of them use AMD [[central processing unit|CPU]]s.

Notable game engine developers include [[Epic Games]] ([[Unreal Engine]]) and [[Unity Technologies]] ([[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]).

====Regions====
The [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] is home to important video game conventions, such as [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3), one of the largest video game industry-only events in the world, and [[Penny Arcade Expo]] (PAX West), the largest public video game convention in [[North America]]. The West Coast is also home to many of the major American video game industry companies, particularly the regions of [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and [[Seattle]]. Major game development regions outside of the West Coast include the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Texas]].

====People====
Over 150 million Americans play video games, with an average age of 35 and a gender breakdown of 59 percent male and 41 percent female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theesa.com/about-esa/industry-facts/|title=Industry Facts|publisher=[[Entertainment Software Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; American gamers are more likely to vote than non-gamers, feel that the economy is the most important political issue, and lean [[conservative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theesa.com/article/new-study-finds-video-game-players-are-highly-engaged-politically/|title=New Study Finds Video Game Players Are Highly Engaged Politically|publisher=[[Entertainment Software Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several important [[List of video game industry people|game development personalities]] were born in or moved to the United States. Notable developers include [[Ralph H. Baer]] ([[Magnavox Odyssey]], the "Father of Video Games"), [[Jonathan Blow]] (''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]''), [[John D. Carmack]] (''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''), and [[Alexey Pajitnov]] (''[[Tetris]]''). [[Mario]] is named after [[Mario Segale]], a former landlord of [[Nintendo of America]]. Some [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] activists, including [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] and [[Anita Sarkeesian]], have met extreme resistance from the gaming public in response to the perceived politicizing of their art form.&lt;ref name=TC2&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/25/gamergate-an-issue-with-2-sides/ | title=#GamerGate – An Issue With Two Sides | author= Allum Bokhari | publisher=[[TechCrunch]] | accessdate= September 27, 2014|date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sports====
The United States recognizes [[eSports]] players as professional athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/07/14/the-u-s-now-recognizes-esports-players-as-professional-athletes/|title=The U.S. Now Recognizes eSports Players As Professional Athletes|publisher=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Major League Gaming]] has eSports arenas and studios across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/09/23/major-league-gaming-announces-its-own-arena-in-columbus-ohio/|title=Major League Gaming announces its own arena in Columbus, Ohio|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Morris University]] has a [[League of Legends]] [[varsity team]], whose members are eligible for [[scholarship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamasutra.com/view/news/219522/Illinois_university_makes_League_of_Legends_a_varsity_sport.php |title=Illinois university makes League of Legends a varsity sport|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trends ==
Players become fourth-party developers, allowing for more [[Open-source software|open source]] models of [[game design]], development and engineering. Players also create [[Mod (computer gaming)|modifications]] (mods), which in some cases become just as popular as the original game for which they were created. An example of this is the game ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'', which began as a mod of the video game ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' and eventually became a very successful, published game in its own right.

While this "community of modifiers" may only add up to approximately 1% of a particular game's user base, the number of those involved will grow as more games offer modifying opportunities (such as, by releasing [[source code]]) and the video user base swells. According to Ben Sawyer, as many as 600,000 established online game community developers existed as of 2012. This effectively added a new component to the [[video game industry#Game industry value chain|game industry value chain]] and if it continues to mature, it will integrate itself into the overall industry.&lt;ref name="newmedia" /&gt;

The industry has seen a shift towards games with [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] facilities. A larger percentage of games on all types of platforms include some type of competitive online multiplayer capability.

In addition, the industry is experiencing further significant change driven by convergence, with technology and player comfort being the two primary reasons for this wave of industry convergence. Video games and related content can now be accessed and played on a variety of media, including: cable television, dedicated consoles, handheld devices and smartphones, through social networking sites or through an ISP, through a game developer's website, and online through a game console and/or home or office personal computer. In fact, 12% of U.S. households already make regular use of game consoles for accessing video content provided by online services such as Hulu and Netflix. In 2012, for the first time, entertainment usage passed multiplayer game usage on Xbox, meaning that users spent more time with online video and music services and applications than playing multiplayer games. This rapid type of industry convergence has caused the distinction between video game console and personal computers to disappear. A game console with high-speed microprocessors attached to a television set is, for all intents and purposes, a computer and monitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|pages=220–221|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As this distinction has been diminished, players' willingness to play and access content on different platforms has increased. The growing video gamer demographic accounts for this trend, as former president of the Entertainment Software Association Douglas Lowenstein explained at the 10th E3 expo, "Looking ahead, a child born in 1995, E3's inaugural year, will be 19 years old in 2014. And according to Census Bureau data, by the year 2020, there will be 174 million Americans between the ages of 5 and 44. That's 174 million Americans who will have grown up with PlayStations, Xboxes, and GameCubes from their early childhood and teenage years...What this means is that the average gamer will be both older and, given their lifetime familiarity with playing interactive games, more sophisticated and discriminating about the games they play."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|page=221|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of the increasing player willingness to play video games across a variety of media and different platforms can be seen in the rise of casual gaming on smartphones, tablets, and social networking sites as 92% of all smartphone and tablet owners play games at least once a week, 45% play daily, and industry estimates predict that, by 2016, one-third of all global mobile gaming revenue will come from tablets alone. Apple's App Store alone has more than 90,000 game apps, a growth of 1,400% since it went online. In addition, game revenues for iOS and Android mobile devices now exceed those of both Nintendo and Sony handheld gaming systems combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|page=222|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4024">At the Toyfair 2010 in New York City, [[Mattel]] revealed the '''[[WWE]] Legends action figure''' line.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geekweek.com/2010/02/mattel-unveils-wwe-legends-line.html&lt;/ref&gt; The figures are elite style and some also come with accessories. Series 1 arrived at stores in July 2010 with Series 2 right around the corner to be hitting the shelves in August 2010. Series 3, 4, 5 and 6 were announced at the 2010 [[San Diego ComicCon]] and followed in tow, being released to stores in September 2010, October 2010, November 2010 and December 2010 respectively.

'''Moshe Ze'ev Flinker''' (Maurice Wolf Flinker) was a [[Jew]]ish youth born in [[The Hague]] on October 9, 1926 and killed in [[Auschwitz]] by the [[Nazi Regime]] in 1944. He was the son of Eliezer Noah Flinker of Poland, who had migrated to the Netherlands and subsequently become a wealthy businessman. Following the 1940 [[Battle of the Netherlands]], the family left [[The Hague]] for [[Belgium]] to evade [[Nazi]] rule and the rounding up of [[Jews]] by the [[Gestapo]]. The Flinkers stayed in [[Brussels]], Belgium until their arrest in 1944. Moshe and his parents were deported to [[Auschwitz]] and murdered there.

Flinker began writing a diary in 1941. The diary was saved by his siblings and published in [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] by [[Yad Vashem]] in 1958. An English translation was published by Yad Vashem in 1965, titled ''Young Moshe's Diary'', subtitled ''The spiritual torment of a Jewish boy in Nazi Europe''; a second edition followed in 1971. A [[Yiddish]] translation was published by [[Perets]], [[Tel Aviv]] in 1965, titled ''Dos yingl Moyshe: Dos togbukh fun Moyshe Flinker''. A [[German (language)|German]] translation was published in 2008 under the title ''Auch wenn ich hoffe: Das Tagebuch des Moshe Flinker'' by Berlin University Press.

The '''İvriz relief''' is a Hittite [[rock relief]] in south-central [[Anatolia]], located in the town of Aydınkent, formerly called İvriz (modern [[Turkey]], [[Konya Province]], about 17&amp;nbsp;km south-east of the modern town of [[Ereğli, Konya|Ereğli]]). The rock relief is on a rock face near the source of the İvriz Suyu, whose water has damaged the relief in modern times. It depicts the late 8th-century BC king [[Warpalawas]] and the storm-god [[Tarhunzas]] and is accompanied by a hieroglyphic [[Luwian]] inscription.  Rock reliefs are a prominent aspect of [[Hittite art]]. 
[[Image:IvrizRelief.JPG|right|thumb|250px|King Warpalawas (right) before the god Tarhunzas]]

It is the best produced of the many [[Hittites|Hittite]] rock reliefs and measures 4.2 m high by 2.4 m wide. It dates from the second half of the 8th century BC, the time of the [[Neo-Hittite]]-[[Arameans|Aramean]] principalities. On the right hand side of the relief is king Warpalawas of [[Tuwana]] who stands on a stone platform with his hands raised in a gesture of greeting or worship. Opposite him at left stands the god Tarhunzas, who is depicted as much larger. Ripe ears of corn and grape clusters in his hands indicate that he brings about fertility. A sickle at his hip symbolises the time immediately before the harvest. The location of the relief on the cliff face of the İvriz Suyu suggests that the source of the fertility depicted on the relief was not the rare rains but the water which flowed from this spot almost all year. Thus, the spring could indicate the existence of a local spring cult.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mustafa Şahin]]. "Neue Beobachtungen zum Felsrelief von İvriz/Konya. Nicht in den Krieg, sondern zur Ernte: der Gott mit der Sichel." in A. Çilingiroǧlu (Ed.): ''Proceedings of the Fourth Anatolian Iron Ages Colloquium. Held at Mersin, 19 – 23 May 1997'' (= ''Anatolian Iron Ages'' 4; = ''Anatolian Studies'' 49). British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara, London 1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;165–176.&lt;/ref&gt;  In front of the god's face and behind the king's back are three lines of inscription in [[Luwian hieroglyphs]], naming both figures. Another inscription at the base of the rock-face was probably two lines long, but it is badly worn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hittitemonuments.com/ivriz/ İvriz Monument]; Translation of the inscriptions by Hawkins 2000, Part 2, p.&amp;nbsp;517, with transliteration. See also: Part 3, Tbl. 292–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

During construction work on the weir in 1986, two further finds were made: a fragment of a stele of Tarhunzas, with a bilingual inscription in Luwian hieroglyphs and [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] saying that it was erected by Warpalawas and part of the head of a large statue, which probably also depicted Tarhunzas. These finds gave support to the idea that the location was a wealthy sanctuary of Tarhunzas patronised by Warpalawas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dietrich Berges]], [[Johannes Nollé]].

Rudolf Habelt, Bonn 2000, {{ISBN|3-7749-2959-9}}, Spp.&amp;nbsp;476–474.&lt;/ref&gt; South of the cliff relief in the hills along the Ambar Deresi river, near ''Kızlar Sarayı'' (the ruins of a Byzantine abbey), is another relief, which is a copy of the İvriz relief. It is not so well carved and was never completely finished - the hieroglyphs are missing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dietrich Berges]], [[Johannes Nollé]]: ''Tyana - Archäologisch-historische Untersuchungen zum südwestlichen Kappadokien''.
