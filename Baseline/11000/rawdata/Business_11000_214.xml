'''ABKO Properties''' was a [[joint venture]] between [[Wichita, Kansas]] [[real estate]] entrepreneur George Ablah and Wichita-based [[Koch Industries]] formed specifically to purchase Chrysler Realty Corporation in the late 1970s from a hard-pressed [[Lee Iacocca]]. Koch Industries is ranked 2 among the Forbes list of largest private companies.  Chrysler Realty Corporation purchases, leases or options dealership facilities and then leases or subleases these facilities to Chrysler dealers. The name ABKO was derived from the first two letters of Ablah’s name and the first two letters of Charles Koch’s name, who is head of Koch Industries.  At the time ABKO was formed, Chrysler was on the verge of bankruptcy.

==History==

ABKO purchased around 840 Chrysler [[Car dealerships in the USA|automotive dealership]] sites around the country controlled by Iacocca in 1979 for slightly over $100 million in cash.  Not all the sites were owned by Chrysler Realty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chrysler's Realty Sale May Be Overly Touted|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1979/09/16/chryslers-realty-sale-may-be-overly-touted/9ca2d3dc-7163-42ae-844c-7a0f35ee3037/|website=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the leadership of Ablah and his team, Chrysler Realty president Ed Homer (for a brief time), executive vice president Corliss (Corky) Nelson of Koch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D10FF3B5C0C728CDDAB0894DA484D81|title=EXECUTIVES|date=1982-02-01|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; acquisition/disposition specialists Wayne Delfino and Frank Mills, and attorney John Schippel, among others, ABKO set forth a strategy to diversify Chrysler Realty Corporation by way of liquidating non-performing Chrysler dealership properties by tax-free exchange and sale.

In 1983, Iacocca, assisted by a government bailout he organized, repurchased 446 of the dealerships in a measure aimed at strengthening the Chrysler dealer network.  ABKO dissolved shortly thereafter.

'''ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc.''' was an American [[oncology]] company, now part of Takeda Oncology, which was founded in 1991 by [[Harvey Berger|Harvey J. Berger, M.D.]] and headquartered in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. ARIAD engaged in the discovery, development, and commercialization of medicines for cancer patients.

ARIAD’s most prominent drug discoveries include Iclusig, designed for patients with all forms of Philadelphia chromosome-positive [Ph+] [[Chronic myelogenous leukemia|chronic myeloid leukemia]] (CML) or Ph+ [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] (ALL) who are resistant to or unable to tolerate other [[tyrosine kinase]] inhibitors, and [[brigatinib]], a [[lung cancer]] drug which has completed its registration trial in ALK fusion driven non-small cell lung cancer as of June 2016 and was approved in the U.S. in April 2017.

In January 2017, [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]] announced it would acquire ARIAD for $5.2 billion, expanding the company's oncology and hematology business. On February 16, 2017, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. announced it had completed its acquisition of ARIAD and incorporated ARIAD into Takeda Oncology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/takeda-to-acquire-ariad-pharmaceuticals-for-52b/81253671&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company history==
ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was founded in 1991 in Cambridge, Massachusetts by Harvey J. Berger, M.D. ARIAD raised $46 million as its initial financing in 1992, making it the single highest round of funding in the biotechnology industry at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/27/business/company-news-ariad-raises-46-million-in-placement.html|title=COMPANY NEWS; Ariad Raises $46 Million In Placement|last=Pollack|first=Rew|date=1992-03-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARIAD filed for an initial public offering through NASDAQ in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/16/business/equity-issues-this-week.html|title=Equity Issues This Week|date=1994-05-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARIAD established its European headquarters in [[Lausanne|Lausanne, Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/bioflash/2016/05/ariad-sells-european-operations-for-140m-upfront.html|title=Ariad sells European operations for $140M upfront plus royalties|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bizjournals.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company sells and markets its initial drug, Iclusig, through specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors in the United States. In 2016, ARIAD sold its European business and the distribution of Iclusig to Incyte Corp and now receives royalties and other payments from Incyte based on Iclusig sales in the EU.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ARIAD also developed two small-molecule drugs, ridaforolimus and rimiducid, and licensed them to companies with complementary technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/ARIAD+Pharma+(ARIA)+Will+Update+on+Key+Initiatives+for+FY15;+Offers+Prelim.+FY14+Numbers/10159308.html|title=ARIAD Pharma (ARIA) Will Update on Key Initiatives for FY15; Offers Prelim. FY14 Numbers|work=StreetInsider.com|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, the company announced it was due to receive up to $200 million through a [[royalty financing]] deal with [[PDL BioPharma]]. ARIAD is obligated to repay the $200&amp;nbsp;mm and a predefined interest, with the note being guaranteed by future sales of [[ponatinib]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/ariad-to-receive-up-to-200m-in-royalty-deal/81251568/|title=Ariad to Receive Up-to $200M in Royalty Deal - GEN Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News - Biotech from Bench to Business - GEN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;nowiki/&gt;and in some cases, brigatinib.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bioworld.com/content/ariad-pharmaceuticals-strikes-synthetic-royalty-deal-pdl-back-cancer-programs|title=Ariad Pharmaceuticals strikes synthetic royalty deal with PDL to back cancer programs|website=BioWorld|language=en|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 21, 2014 ARIAD Pharmaceuticals announced the appointment of Sarissa Capital's Alexander J. Denner, Ph.D. to a two-year term on the company's Board of Directors and became ARIAD's second-largest shareholder. In 2016, ARIAD announced that Denner had become the chairman of the board&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160110005030/en/ARIAD-Announces-Election-Alex-Denner-Chairman-Board|title=ARIAD Announces Election of Alex Denner as Chairman of the Board of Directors|publisher=Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the company announced the termination of its shareholder's rights plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160111005320/en/ARIAD-Announces-Termination-Shareholder-Rights-Plan|title=ARIAD Announces Termination of Shareholder Rights Plan -|publisher=Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the company was ranked #3 on the [[Deloitte Fast 500#Fast 500 North America|Deloitte Fast 500 North America]] list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/fast500-winners.html?nc=1|title=2016 Winners by rank|publisher=[[Deloitte]]|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berger retired as chairman and CEO of ARIAD in December 2015 and became Founder, chairman and CEO Emeritus as of January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2017/01/09/takeda-deal-results-in-a-huge-windfall-for-former.html|title=Takeda deal results in a huge windfall for former Ariad CEO Harvey Berger|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bizjournals.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medcitynews.com/2017/05/biotech-figure-henri-termeer-dies-at-71/|title=Larger-than-life biotech figure Henri Termeer dies at 71 - MedCity News|website=medcitynews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, the company launched Any.do 4, that combined the a to do list, a calendar, and a part AI part human personal assistant that can complete users tasks in a single app.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/next-evolution-productivity-omer-perchik?published=t|title=The Next Evolution of Productivity|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the company announced a partnership with Amazon Alexa and Slack. In 2018, the company launched a smart grocery list and shopping list feature as well as integration with Google Assistant and Siri.

Any.do was co-founded by Omer Perchik, Itay Kahana, and Yoni Lindenfeld. It has offices in both [[Tel Aviv]] and [[San Francisco]].

== History ==
Prior to Any.do, co-founders ''Omer Perchik'', ''Itay Kahana'' and ''Yoni Lindenfeld'' launched a simpler version of the app on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] called Taskos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Tessa|title=I'm Omer Perchik, and This Is the Story Behind Any.do|url=http://lifehacker.com/im-omer-perchik-and-this-is-the-story-behind-any-do-1440128266|publisher=Lifehacker|date=Oct 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2010, Taskos had 1.3 million users and served as a test version for what would eventually become Any.do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Grove|first=Jennifer|title=Collaborative to-do app Any.do puts Reminders to shame|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/11/10/any-do/|publisher=Venturebeat|date=Nov 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The company opened development offices in Tel Aviv, Israel and opened its business headquarters in San Francisco, California in 2012.&lt;ref name="Gannes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingsd.com/20120604/well-liked-android-task-list-any-do-comes-to-iphone-and-chrome/|title=Well-Liked Android Task List Any.DO Comes to iPhone and Chrome|last=Gannes|first=Liz|date=June 4, 2012|publisher=All Things D}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, the company released a study revealing the mobile habits of their most productive “super users”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/229897|title=5 Habits of Productivity App Super Users|last=|first=|date=Nov 18, 2013|website=|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=Dec 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==

On October 9, 2013, The Verge reported Any.do to be the one of the main inspirations behind Jony Ive’s [[iOS 7]] redesign, and others have noted its similarities to the revamped Apple operating system.&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/9/4817146/taskmasters-how-israeli-intelligence-officers-helped-inspire-the-look-of-ios-7|title=Taskmasters: how Israeli intelligence officers helped inspire the look of iOS 7|last=Newton|first=Casey|date=Oct 9, 2013|publisher=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fiegerman|first=Seth|title=iOS 7 Updates Look a Little Too Familiar to Some Apple Developers|url=http://mashable.com/2013/06/11/ios-7-developers/|publisher=Mashable|date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==

Any.do announced $1 million in angel funding in November 2011.&lt;ref name="Perez1M" /&gt;

By May 2013 the company had raised $3.5 million from [[Genesis Partners]], [[Eric Schmidt]]’s Innovation Endeavors, [[Blumberg Capital]], Joe Lonsdale of [[Palantir Technologies]], Brian Koo of [[Formation 8]], Joe Greenstein of [[Flixter]], and Felicis Ventures.&lt;ref name="Perez3M"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/13/intelligent-to-do-list-app-any-do-raises-3-5-million-will-further-expand-into-personal-productivity-space/|title=Intelligent To Do List App Any.DO Raises $3.5 Million, Will Further Expand Into Personal Productivity Space|last=Perez|first=Sarah|date=May 13, 2013|publisher=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company raised additional unannounced funding from a group of strategic investors including [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Yang]] of AME Cloud Ventures and [[Steve Chen]] of YouTube, among others, by October of that same year.&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt;

'''Bernard McGlinchey''' (18 October 1932 – 11 April 2013) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] businessman and [[Fianna Fáil]] politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.donegaldemocrat.ie/news/local/death-of-a-political-legend-bernard-mcglinchey-80-dies-at-his-home-1-4991481|title=Death of a political legend - Bernard McGlinchey (80) dies at his home|newspaper=Donegal Democrat|date=11 April 2013|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of [[Seanad Éireann]] from 1961 to 1981, and from 1982 to 1983.

He was expelled from secondary school.&lt;ref name=pioneering_electoral_strategist/&gt;

At the start of his political career McGlinchey was closely linked with [[Neil Blaney]]. Paul M.

McGlinchey stood for election to [[Dáil Éireann]] in the constituencies of [[Donegal North-East (Dáil constituency)|Donegal North-East]] ([[Irish general election, 1973|1973]], [[Irish general election, 1981|1981]], [[Irish general election, November 1982|November 1982]]) and [[Donegal (Dáil constituency)|Donegal]] ([[Irish general election, 1977|1977]]), but was unsuccessful each time.&lt;ref name=elecs_irl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=3004|title=Bernard McGlinchey|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of [[Donegal County Council]] for the [[Letterkenny]] area until 2004.&lt;ref name=elecs_irl/&gt;

McGlinchey is said to have "practically invented as a politician" [[Jim McDaid]], selecting "the young, presentable McDaid" and setting him on the path for a career in national politics.&lt;ref name=lover_drunk_minister_doctor&gt;{{cite news|first=Liam|last=Collins|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/lover-drunk-minister-now-doctor-again-26411171.html|title=Lover, drunk, minister now doctor again|work=Sunday Independent|date=30 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDaid achieved what McGlinchey could not, being elected to the Dáil on his first attempt at the [[Irish general election, 1989|1989 general election]], eventually serving in government, as Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation between 1997 and 2002 and as Minister of State for Transport between 2002 and 2004, and being re-elected to the Dáil at every subsequent election until his retirement in 2010.

==Personal life==
McGlinchey married Elizabeth and had five children: three daughters and two sons.&lt;ref name=pioneering_electoral_strategist/&gt; One of his daughters, Adrienne McGlinchey, featured in the national media in 2002 in relation to the [[Death of John Carthy|Carty Inquiry]]. She was born in 1965 in Letterkenny and shared a flat in [[Buncrana]] between 1991 and 1995 with Yvonne Devine, a Letterkenny woman who had been employed by a restaurant run by McGlinchey family members in the town. Adrienne McGlinchey was arrested several times in this period, though records seem to exist mainly of one arrest in July 1991. A garda sergeant acquainted with her described her as "a [[Walter Mitty]] type of person".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Anita|last=Guidera|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/three-to-play-major-role-as-stories-inextricably-linked-26026200.html|title=Three to play major role as stories 'inextricably linked'|work=Irish Independent|date=5 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bertagni''' is an [[Italian cuisine|Italian food]] company founded in [[Bologna]] by [[Luigi Bertagni]] in 1882.

==History==
[[File:Scatolina-tortellini-bertagni.png|thumb|left|125px|Tortellini pack.]]

The birth of "Pastificio Bertagni" was in 1882 in the workshop of Luigi Bertagni in [[Bologna]]. Luigi Bertagni, with his brothers Ferdinando and Oreste, not only made quality fresh [[tortellini]], but also studied a method in order to package and conserve them, and thus Luigi developed his business.&lt;ref&gt;MAIOLI, Giorgio - ROVERSI, Giancarlo, Sua maestà il tortellino, Re Enzo editrice, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bologna-tra-storia-e-osterie"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Nm_qI9uQvcC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=pastificio+bertagni++bologna&amp;source=bl |title=Bologna tra storia e osterie: viaggio nelle tradizioni enogastronomiche petroniane... -  Alessandro Molinari Pradelli  ed. Pendragon  2001.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to the  entrepreneurial spirit of Bertagni brothers, their tortellini was appreciated more and more in Italy and abroad. The Bertagni brothers entered their pastas in numerous World Fairs, winning the bronze medal at The World’s Fair in Paris in 1889 and at The Chicago Fair in 1894, and the gold medal in St. Louis in 1904.

Pastificio Bertagni continued its rapid growth and by the beginning of the 20th century was a well known pasta producer.  The ''Bologna Commercial Guide'' described the company: "[[Tortellini]] from Bologna, whose fame went across the seas, by all the gourmets are reputed astoundingly good! It is the Bologna company Bertagni that holds the record of this production and sells tortellini all over the world."&lt;ref name="bologna-tra-storia-e-osterie" /&gt;

In 1986 the respected gastronomic critic Corby Kummer declared: Bertagni specialty filled pastas... are excellent and are the closest thing to having a pasta store down the street.&lt;ref&gt;Corby Kummer, ''The Atlantic Monthly'', July 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the company was sold to [[Food|pasta industry]] veterans, resulting in a great increase in sales, carrying its [[Pasta|filled pasta]] specialities onto the tables of the [[world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bertagni.it|title=History, in Bertagni.it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Business Centre Australia''''' was once one of [[CNBC Asia]]'s business news shows to round-up the trading day in Australia.  During its debut in late January 2001, it initially aired only to viewers on CNBC Asia's Australian feed but later that year it was made available across the region.  The show was presented by [[Amanda Drury]] from Singapore and [[Mark Laudi]] from Sydney although Laudi eventually moved back to Singapore and co-hosted the show there.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4796">A '''business partner''' is a commercial entity with which another commercial entity has some form of [[Business alliance|alliance]]. This relationship may be a [[contract]]ual, exclusive bond in which both entities commit not to ally with third parties. Alternatively, it may be a very loose arrangement designed largely to impress customers and competitors with the size of the network the business partners belong to.

== Business mating (partnership formation) ==
A business partner or alliance can be crucial for businesses. However, businesses can not choose business partners in any way they want. In many instances, the potential partner might not be interested in forming a business relationship, also known as business mating. It is important that both sides of the agreement complement each other, but also that there are some common ground. For example, in management style, mindset, and also technology. If, for example, management style would be too different between the firms then a partnership could be problematic. Kask and Linton (2013) &lt;ref&gt;Kask and Linton (2013) Business mating: when start-ups get it right http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08276331.2013.876765#.U0UEcfl_t8F&lt;/ref&gt; investigate under what conditions business mating (formation) takes place for startup firms seeking business partners. 

== Differentiation ==
The meaning of the term is quite different from that implied in [[partnership]], and it is because of the potential for confusion between the two that widespread use of 'business partner' has been discouraged at times in the past.

A business partner can be:
# A [[Distribution (business)|supplier]]
# A [[customer]]
# A channel intermediary (such as an [[agent (law)|agent]] or [[reseller]]), or
# A vendor of complementary offerings (for example, one party sells the hardware, while the other sells the software)
This is a wider definition than a [[business alliance]].

A Business Partner is becoming more common in HR departments as it represents the employees position, ideally seeing the HR issues from the employers and employees point of view. Small and medium business are often turning to external HR Business Partners to solve any HR disputes.

== Cohesion ==
One example of a business partnership is the "Agility Alliance" originated by [[Electronic Data Systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eds.com/services/alliances/agility/ |title=Agility Alliance &amp;#124; HP Services |publisher=Eds.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of this IT-focused alliance include [[Microsoft]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[SAP AG|SAP]].  This highlights two problems with multi-party partnerships:
* Two of the companies may be partners with a third member of the partnership, but highly aggressive towards each other.  (Oracle and SAP compete against each other in the [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]]  market.)
* One party may be partner to a second party when targeting one market, but competitive against that same company when targeting another market.  (Microsoft may be happy to work with Sun when Sun is offering its servers, but far less happy when Sun is proposing [[OpenOffice.org]], in contention with Microsoft Office.)

== Business partner search ==
'''Business partner search''' or '''business matchmaking''' is the process/service of finding buyers/customers, distributors, licensees, and/or other business partners. This can be provided as a paid service by a commercial organization, or as a free service by the commercial section of a country's embassy/consulate or an association of businesses in a particular area.

Customarily commercial consideration of this service is a one time fee. Fee of this service depends on the business domain, the volume of business of both partners that will end up in a partnership relation as the end result of this service, etc.

In a specific example of a specific domain this fee is found between EUR 1800~2200 depending on the tasks required from the business matchmaker.

The '''Darwin Awards''' are a [[tongue-in-cheek]] honor, originating in [[Usenet]] newsgroup discussions around 1985. They recognize individuals who have supposedly contributed to human [[evolution]] by [[natural selection|selecting]] themselves out of the [[gene pool]] via [[death]] or [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] by their own actions.

The project became more formalized with the creation of a [[website]] in 1993, and followed up by a series of [[book]]s starting in 2000, authored by Wendy Northcutt. The criterion for the awards states, "In the spirit of [[Charles Darwin]], the Darwin Awards commemorate individuals who protect our gene pool by making the ultimate sacrifice of their own lives. Darwin Award winners [[list of unusual deaths|eliminate themselves in an extraordinarily idiotic manner]], thereby improving our species' chances of long-term survival."&lt;ref name="history_and_rules"&gt;{{cite web|last=Northcutt|first=Wendy|title=History &amp; Rules|url=http://www.darwinawards.com/rules/rules1.html|publisher=www.darwinawards.com|accessdate=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accidental self-sterilization also qualifies; however, the site notes: "Of necessity, the award is usually bestowed posthumously." The candidate is disqualified, though, if "innocent bystanders", who might have contributed positively to the gene pool, are killed in the process.

The Darwin Awards books state that an attempt is made to disallow known [[urban legend]]s from the awards, but some older "winners" have been "[[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]]" to keep their awards. The Darwin Awards site does try to verify all submitted stories, but many similar sites, and the vast number of circulating "Darwin awards" emails, are largely fictional.

== History ==
[[File:Wendy Northcutt.jpg|thumb|right|Wendy Northcutt, author of the Darwin Awards website and books]]
The origin of the Darwin Awards can be traced back to posts on [[Usenet]] group discussions as early as 1985. An early post, on August 7, 1985, describes the awards as being, "given posthumously to people who have made the supreme sacrifice to keep their genes out of our [[gene pool|pool]]. Style counts, not everyone who dies from their own stupidity can win."&lt;ref name="Freeman_Andy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Freeman|first=Andy|title=Darwin Awards.|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!msg/net.bizarre/V5o__gcmIf0/fZ5sv2BvzAsJ%5B1-25%5D|accessdate=August 14, 2012|newspaper=[[Google groups]] archive of net.bizarre.|date=August 7, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early post cites an example of a person who pulled a [[vending machine]] over his head and was crushed to death trying to break into it.&lt;ref name="Freeman_Andy" /&gt; Another widely distributed early story mentioning the Darwin Awards is the [[JATO Rocket Car]], which describes a man who strapped a [[JATO|jet-assisted take-off]] unit to his [[Chevrolet Impala]] in the [[Arizona]] desert and who died on the side of a cliff as his car achieved speeds of {{convert|250|to|300|mph}}. This story was later confirmed to be an urban legend by the Arizona Department of Public Safety.&lt;ref name="Mikkelson_Barbara"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mikkelson|first=Barbara|title=Carmageddon.|url=http://www.snopes.com/autos/dream/jato.asp|accessdate=August 14, 2012|newspaper=[[Snopes]]|date=November 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official Darwin Awards website run by Northcutt does its best to confirm all stories submitted, listing them as, "confirmed true by Darwin." Many of the [[viral email]]s circulating the [[Internet]], however, are hoaxes and urban legends.&lt;ref name="Mikkelson_Barbara_2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mikkelson|first=Barbara|title=2004 Darwin Awards.|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/freakish/darwin04.asp|accessdate=August 14, 2012|newspaper=[[Snopes]]|date=July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website and collection of books were started in 1993 by Wendy Northcutt, who at the time was a graduate in [[molecular biology]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="Rice_Stanley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rice|first=Stanley A.|title=Encyclopedia of Evolution|chapter=Darwin Awards|year=2007|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York |isbn=978-0-8160-5515-9|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YRcAVvmE6eMC&amp;pg=PA108}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to study [[neurobiology]] at [[Stanford University]], doing research on [[cancer]] and [[telomerase]]. In her spare time, she organized [[chain letter]]s from family members into the original Darwin Awards website hosted in her personal account space at  Stanford. She eventually left the bench in 1998 and devoted herself full-time to her website and books in September 1999.&lt;ref name="Hawkins_John"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hawkins |first=John |title=A Conversation with Darwin (Webmaster of the Darwin Awards). |url=http://www.rightwingnews.com/interviews/darwin.php |accessdate=August 14, 2012 |newspaper=Right Wing News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622054043/http://www.rightwingnews.com/interviews/darwin.php |archivedate=June 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2002, the website received 7 million page hits per month.&lt;ref name="Clark_Doug"&gt;{{cite news|last=Clark |first=Doug |title=Let's hear it for natural selection. |url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/news-story.asp?date=111402&amp;ID=s1253392 |accessdate=September 18, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |date=November 14, 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203052123/http://www.spokesmanreview.com/news-story.asp?date=111402&amp;ID=s1253392 |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She encountered some difficulty in publishing the first book, since most publishers would only offer her a deal if she agreed to remove the stories from the Internet. Northcutt refused to do so, saying, "It was a community! I could not do that. Even though it might have cost me a lot of money, I kept saying no." She eventually found a publisher who agreed to print a book containing only 10% of the material gathered for the website. The first book turned out to be a success, and was listed on ''[[The New York Times]]'' bestseller list for six months.&lt;ref name="John_123reg"&gt;{{cite news|author=John|title=Pet porn, rocket cars and hand grenades.|url=http://www.123-reg.co.uk/blog/interviews/darwin-awards-pet-porn-and-hand-grenades/|accessdate=August 31, 2012|newspaper=123-reg|date=April 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of the feedback from the stories Northcutt published was positive, and she occasionally received email from people who knew the deceased. One such person wrote, "This is horrible. It has shocked our community to the core. You should remove this." But Northcutt said "I can't. It's just too stupid." Northcutt kept the stories on the website and in her books, citing them as a "funny-but-true safety guide", and mentioning that children who read the book are going to be much more careful around explosives.&lt;ref name="CNN_interview"&gt;{{cite news|title='Darwin Awards' author dedicated to documenting macabre mishaps. |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-01-03/entertainment/darwin.awards_1_deaths-darwin-award-wendy-northcutt |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130119105342/http://articles.cnn.com/2001-01-03/entertainment/darwin.awards_1_deaths-darwin-award-wendy-northcutt |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 19, 2013 |accessdate=September 18, 2012 |newspaper=[[CNN]] |date=January 3, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website also recognizes, with Honorable Mentions, individuals who survive their misadventures with their reproductive capacity intact. One example of this is [[Larry Walters|Lawnchair Larry]], who attached [[helium]]-filled [[weather balloon]]s to a lawn chair and floated far above [[Long Beach, California]], in July 1982. He reached an altitude of {{convert|16000|ft|m}} but survived, to be later fined for crossing [[controlled airspace]].&lt;ref name="Greany_Walker_Hecht"&gt;{{cite news |authors=Greany, Ed; Walker, Douglas; Hecht, Walter |title=Lawn Chair Larry |url=http://darwinawards.com/stupid/stupid1998-11.html |accessdate=August 14, 2012 |newspaper=www.darwinawards.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable honorable mention was given to the two men who attempted to burgle the home of footballer [[Duncan Ferguson]] (who had four convictions for assault and had served six months in Glasgow's [[Barlinnie Prison]]) in 2001, with one burglar requiring three days' hospitalization after being confronted by the player.&lt;ref name="McSean_Nash"&gt;{{cite news |authors=McSean, Tony; Nash, Pete |title=Ferguson 2, Thieves 0 |url=http://darwinawards.com/stupid/stupid2001-04.html |accessdate=August 14, 2012 |publisher=www.darwinawards.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study published in the [[British Medical Journal]] found that between 1995 and 2014 males represented 88.7% of Darwin Award winners (see figure).&lt;ref name=Lendrem&gt;{{Cite journal| doi=10.1136/bmj.g7094 |volume=349 |pages=g7094 |last1=Lendrem |first1=Ben Alexander Daniel |last2=Lendrem |first2=Dennis William |last3=Gray |first3=Andy |last4=Isaacs |first4=John Dudley |title=The Darwin Awards: sex differences in idiotic behaviour |journal=BMJ |date=December 11, 2014 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7094 |pmid=25500113 |accessdate=August 12, 2016 |pmc=4263959}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 [[comedy film]], ''[[The Darwin Awards (film)|The Darwin Awards]]'', written and directed by [[Finn Taylor]], was based on the website and many of  the Darwin Awards stories.

== Rules ==
Northcutt has stated five requirements for a Darwin Award:&lt;ref name="history_and_rules" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen_Suzy"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hansen |first=Suzy |title=The Darwin Awards |url=http://www.salon.com/2000/11/10/northcutt/ |accessdate=September 18, 2012 |newspaper=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=November 10, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inability to reproduce ===
;Nominee must be dead or rendered sterile
This may be subject to dispute. Potential awardees may be out of the gene pool because of age; others have already reproduced before their deaths. To avoid debates about the possibility of [[in-vitro fertilization]], [[artificial insemination]], or [[human cloning|cloning]], the original Darwin Awards book applied the following "deserted island" test to potential winners: If the person were unable to reproduce when stranded on a deserted island with a fertile member of the opposite sex, he or she would be considered sterile.&lt;ref name="book_one"&gt;{{cite book |last=Northcutt |first=Wendy |title=The Darwin Awards: Evolution in Action |year=2000 |publisher=PLUME (The Penguin Group) |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-525-94572-7 |pages=2–6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Cowke97r_IkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=darwin+awards#v=onepage&amp;q=darwin%20awards&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winners of the award, in general, either are dead or have become unable to use their [[sexual organs]].

=== Excellence ===
;Astoundingly stupid judgment
The candidate's foolishness must be unique and sensational, likely because the award is intended to be funny. A number of foolish but common activities, such as smoking in bed, are excluded from consideration. In contrast, [[self-immolation]] caused by smoking after being administered a flammable ointment in a hospital and specifically told not to smoke is grounds for nomination.&lt;ref name="stubbed_out"&gt;{{cite web |author1=C.J. |author2=Malcolm, Andrew |author3=Sims, Iain |author4=Beeston, Richard. |title=Stubbed Out |url=http://darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin2006-06.html |publisher=www.darwinawards.com |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One "Honorable Mention" (a man who attempted suicide by swallowing [[Glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|nitroglycerine pills]], and then tried to detonate them by running into a wall) is noted to be in this category, despite being intentional and self-inflicted (i.e. attempted [[suicide]]), which would normally disqualify the inductee.&lt;ref name="Cawcutt_Tom"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cawcutt |first=Tom |title=Phenomenal Failure |url=http://darwinawards.com/stupid/stupid2001-24.html |publisher=www.darwinawards.com |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-selection ===
;Cause of one's own demise
Killing a friend with a [[hand grenade]] would not be eligible, but killing oneself while manufacturing a homemade [[chimney]]-cleaning device from a grenade would be eligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Northcutt, Wendy |title=Chimney-Cleaning Grenade |url=http://darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin2005-09.html |publisher=www.darwinawards.com |year=2005 |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To earn a Darwin Award, one must have killed oneself, or rendered oneself sterile; merely causing death to a third party is insufficient.

=== Maturity ===
;Capable of sound judgment
The nominee must be at least past the legal driving age and free of [[intellectual disability|mental defect]] (Northcutt considers injury or death caused by mental defect to be tragic, rather than amusing, and routinely disqualifies such entries). After much discussion,  a small category regarding deaths below this age limit also exists. Entry into this category requires that the peers of the candidate be of the opinion that the actions of the person in question were above and beyond the limits of reason.

However, in 2011, the awards targeted a 16-year-old boy in Leeds who died stealing copper wiring (the standard minimum driving age in Great Britain being 17). In 2012, Northcutt made similar light of a 14-year-old girl in Brazil who was killed while leaning out of a school bus window; however, she was "disqualified" for the award itself because of the likely public objection due to the girl's age, which Northcutt asserts is based on "[[magical thinking]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homoeconomicusnet.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/darwin-awards-2012-too-young-to-include/|title=Darwin Awards 2012 – too young to include?|date=10 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Veracity ===
;Event must be verified
The story must be documented by reliable sources: e.g., reputable newspaper articles, confirmed television reports, or responsible eyewitnesses.  If a story is found to be untrue, it is disqualified, but particularly amusing ones are placed in the [[urban legend]] section of the archives.  Despite this requirement, many of the stories are fictional, often appearing as "original submissions" and presenting no further sources than unverified (and unreliable) "eyewitnesses". Most such stories on Northcutt's Darwin Awards site are filed in the Personal Accounts section.

In addition, later revisions to the qualification criteria add several requirements that have not been made into formalized 'rules': innocent bystanders cannot be in danger, and the qualifying event 'must' be caused without deliberate intent (to prevent glory-seekers from purposely injuring themselves solely to win a Darwin).

[[File:211 Fort Street, detroit.jpg|thumb|Metro area business leaders belong to the Detroit Economic Club, headquartered at [[211 West Fort Street]].]]

The '''Detroit Economic Club''', headquartered at [[211 West Fort Street]] in downtown [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], was formed in 1934 as a platform for the discussion and debate of important business, government and social issues. It is known internationally as a top speaking forum for prominent business, academic, and government officials, who address members and their guests at the Club's 35-meeting season. With more than 3,500 members, the DEC is a forum for vital issues. The DEC claims to have hosted every sitting U.S. President since [[Richard Nixon]] and is ranked among the top speaking platforms in the world.  The DEC is one of the most valued podiums for CEO's in the world and one of the top five executive speaking forums in America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econclub.org/ Detroit Economic Club]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Detroit Economic Club was founded in 1934 by Allen Crow. The objective of the Club was and still is: to promote an interest in, and to enlighten its members on important governmental, economic and societal issues. The growth in the Club was rapid in the first year, with 275 men joining. Specifically "men" because women were not admitted until 1973.  That was the year after Michigan ratified the Equal Rights Amendment.  Within five years of the inception, the Club's membership had grown to 1,100 and post World War II the membership was approaching 2,000. The logo of the Club is an Aladdin's Lamp, which Crow selected it because it was the Greek symbol for enlightenment. That is what the Club is all about. Born out of the Depression, the Club tends to succeed, even when the economy is not. Founder, Allen Crow, had a big idea: "Maybe if you gathered a lot of smart people in one room, on a regular basis, they could figure the way out (The Great Depression)."

== Operation ==
The main activity of the Club is usually is in the form of a breakfast or lunch/business meeting setting. The Club presents, on average, 35 meetings per year.  Where the speaker(s) take the podium/stage and address whatever their topic is at that time. Speakers usually speak for about 20–30 minutes and there is reserved times for networking and questions. Traditionally, the club would meet on Monday's. You might wonder why the Club met on a Monday. The history goes back before commercial air travel and the meetings were scheduled by Allen Crow on Monday's so that the speakers could travel to Detroit by train over the weekend and this would conserve their weekly business time. Originally, annual dues were $5.00 and tickets were $1.50. Over the years the dues have naturally increased to keep pace with inflation and growth. Now the Club has five categories of memberships ranging from Young Leader dues at $75.00 to Gold Membership at $500.00. The Club's meeting place was and still are some of the same venues from the early stages of the Club such as: the Book Cadillac Hotel (now the Westin Book Cadillac), and later a number of the Club's meetings took place at Cobo Hall, and is still a principal location.

== Speakers ==
How The Club obtain speakers, is often asked. In early days, they did pay, but this costly practice was eliminated. Now, the speakers come because they welcome the opportunity to address the Club's prestigious forum, and for the extensive outreach they know their message will receive. In addition to the newspaper coverage that the speakers receive, a number of radio stations use to broadcast the meetings and was carried to about 400,000 Metro-Detroit area homes. Now, there is still the newspaper and radio coverage, but by technology advancing the way that it has, the Club sometimes have a live-stream for viewers at home or members on the road. The Club has always pushed to obtain some of the region's most prominent and well spoken leaders around the globe. To be fair, The Club has hosted a meeting with every President of the United States since former President Nixon.  The first woman speaker at the DEC was Catherine Curtis on November 1, 1937 and she spoke on "The Housewife as Capitalist." The first Black speaker was Lester Granger, President of  the National Urban League on January 19, 1948. In addition to those groundbreaking speakers, there has been a number of international level leaders as well to grace the Club with their wisdom and words of enlightenment such as: Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. Antoly Dobrynin, Bruno Kreisky when he was the Australian Chancellor, Ambassador of the Republic of Cuba to the U.S. Jose Ramon Cabanas Rodriguez, and countless others.

== Presidents (DEC Presidents) ==
The President of the Club, historically was the chief operating officer as well as the president. Nowadays, those titles and tasks are handled by two separate individuals with the same goal in mind. Since the first President and Founder, Allen B. Crow, there has been eight other fantastic Leaders of this great Club. Lester Skene Bork, Walker Lee Cisler, (who was also one of the founding members of the National Academy of Engineering) Russel A. Swaney, Theodore H. Mecke, Jr., Wesley R. Johnson, (also served as President of Woodall Industries and Libbey Owens Ford Plastics before retiring and serving the DEC) Gerald E. Warren, William R. Halling, (served on the Board of Directors for: Compuware and KPMG, LLP and also the third longest presidential term for the Club) and current President, Elizabeth "Beth" Chappell, who has been serving the Club for 15 years, which is the second longest term after the Founder, Allen B. Crow. Mrs. Chappell has served as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Detroit Economic Club since 2002. Previously, she served as Executive Vice President, Corporate Communications &amp; Investor Relations for Compuware Corporation. From 1995 to 2000, Mrs. Chappell was President and Chief Executive Officer of a consulting firm she founded, The Chappell Group, Inc. For 16 years, Mrs. Chappell held executive positions at AT&amp;T. From 1999 to 2009. Recently, Beth has announced that she will be moving forward with her career and starting a company that she co-founded with her son-in-law, but insist that members and supporters know that she will always be a part of the Club, as she has been for 27 years.

== Young Leaders Program ==
The Young Leader Program has been growing steadily over the years since its launch in 2007. The Young Leader members are made up of over 1,200 young professionals in out of the Metro-Detroit area. All YL members are under the age of 40 years, which is the only requirement to join the Young Leaders program. Not only do are the YL members allowed to regular DEC meetings, but also have their very own Young Leader Series meetings of their own. In addition to hosting an annual Young Leader Conference. The Young Leader program is continuously growing with more young professionals who are invested into the economic and political future of the great City of Detroit.

== Career Readiness Academy (CRA) ==
The Detroit Economic Club’s Career Readiness Academy is a 6-month program that brings high school and Young Leader (YLs) members together for monthly meetings that aim to teach skills that will help the students effectively navigate their high school journey to find greater success in the working world. The same team of YLs and students meet each month which not only provides the opportunity for more personalized attention but also forges important mentor-mentee relationships. The monthly sessions are broke up into 6 groups, specifically to educate these students on career exploration, economic realities, college, and a number of other amazing tools that they will need as they work their way into the career path of their liking.

==National Summit==
In June 2009, the DEC assembled some of America’s top business, government and academic leaders, among others, in debate and dialogue on four issues of vital importance to America’s future in a global economy - Technology, Energy, Environment, and Manufacturing. The goal of The National Summit was to bring attention to actions that would improve America’s ability to compete in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalsummit.org/overview/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206204604/http://nationalsummit.org/overview |archivedate=2009-02-06 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

However, Iraklis managed to progress to the 2nd round of UEFA Cup. The following summer, Mytilineos sold the highly rated striker Michalis Konstantinou to Panathinaikos, setting a new record for the highest fee received for a domestic transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kourdistoportocali.com/post/32522/mitilinaios |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 8, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428081954/http://kourdistoportocali.com/post/32522/mitilinaios |archivedate=April 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=January 2014}}

A '''consumer good''' or '''final good''' is any [[commodity]] that is produced or consumed by the [[consumer]] to satisfy current wants or needs. Consumer goods are ultimately consumed, rather than used in the production of another good. For example, a [[microwave oven]] or a [[bicycle]] that is sold to a consumer is a final good or consumer good, but the components that are sold to be used in those goods are [[intermediate good]]s. For example, [[textile]]s or [[transistor]]s can be used to make some further goods.

When used in [[measures of national income and output]], the term "final goods" includes only new goods. For instance, the [[GDP]] excludes items counted in an earlier year to prevent [[double counting (accounting)|double counting]] of production that is based on resales of the same item. In that context, the economic definition of goods includes what are commonly known as ''[[service (economics)|services]]''.
 
''Manufactured goods'' are goods that have been processed in any way. As such, they are the opposite of [[raw material]]s, but they include intermediate goods as well as final goods.

== Law ==
There are legal definitions. For example, the United States Consumer Product Safety Act has an extensive definition of '''consumer product''', which begins:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
CONSUMER PRODUCT.--The term ‘‘consumer product’’ means any article, or component part thereof, produced or distributed (i) for sale to a consumer for use in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise, or (ii) for the personal use, consumption or enjoyment of a consumer in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise; but such term does not include—
(A) any article which is not customarily produced or distributed for sale to, or use or consumption by, or enjoyment of, a consumer,
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It then goes on to list eight additional specific exclusions and further details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/cpsa.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108013219/https://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/cpsa.pdf |archivedate=2013-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Durability ==
Final goods can be classified into the following categories:
#[[Durable goods]]
#[[Consumables|Nondurable goods]]
#Services

Consumer durable goods usually have a significant lifespan, which tends to be at least one year, based on the guarantee or warranty period. The maximum life depends upon the durability of the product or good. On the other hand, [[capital good]]s, which are tangible in nature, such as machinery or building or any other equipment that can be used in manufacturing of final product, are durable goods with limited lifespans that are determined by manufacturers before their sale. The longevity and the often-higher cost of durable goods usually cause consumers to postpone expenditures on them, which makes durables the most volatile (or cost-dependent) component of consumption.

Consumer nondurable goods are purchased for immediate use or for use very soon. Generally, the lifespan of nondurable goods is from a few minutes to up to three years: food, beverages, clothing, shoes and gasoline are examples.

Consumer services are the intangible in nature. They cannot be seen, felt or tasted by the consumer but still give satisfaction to the consumer. They are also inseparable and variable in nature: they are thus produced and consumed simultaneously. Examples are haircuts, auto repairs and landscaping.

== Buying habits ==
Final goods can be classified into the following categories, which are determined by the consumer's buying habits:
#Convenience goods 
#Shopping goods
#[[Speciality goods|Specialty goods]] 
#Unsought goods

=== Convenience goods ===
Convenience goods are regularly consumed and easily available. Generally, convenience goods come in the category of nondurable goods such as fast foods, cigarettes and tobacco with low value. Convenience goods are sold mostly by wholesalers or retailers to make them available to the consumers in good or large volume. Convenience goods can further be divided into staple convenience consumer goods and impulse convenience consumer goods.

Staple convenience consumer goods are the basic necessities of the consumer. These goods are easily available and in large quantity: milk, bread, sugar, etc.

Impulse convenience consumer goods do not belong to the priority list of the consumer. They are purchased without any prior planning, just on the basis of the [[impulse buying|impulse]]: potato wafers, candies, ice creams, cold drinks, etc.

=== Shopping consumer goods ===

Shopping consumer goods are the goods which take lot of time and proper planning before making purchase decision; in this case consumer does a lot of selection and comparison based on various parameters such as cost, brand, style, comfort etc., before buying an item. Shopping goods are costlier than convenience goods and are durable in nature. Consumer goods companies usually try to set up their shops and show rooms in active shopping area to attract customer attention and their main focus is to do lots of advertising and promotion so that to attract more customer.

Examples include clothing items, televisions, radios, footwear, home furnishings, etc.

=== Specialty consumer goods ===

Specialty goods are unique in nature; these are unusual and luxurious items available in the market. Specialty goods are mostly purchased by the upper class of the society as they are expensive in nature and difficult to be afforded by middle or lower-class people. Companies advertise their goods targeting the upper class. These goods do not fall under the category of necessity; rather they are purchased on the basis personal preference or desire. Brand name, uniqueness, and special features of an item are major attributes which attract customers and make them buy such products.

Examples include antiques, jewelry, wedding dresses, cars, etc.

=== Unsought consumer goods ===

Unsought goods neither belong to the necessity group of consumer goods list nor to specialty goods. They are always available in the market but are purchased by very few consumers, either based on their interest or their need for some specific reasons. The general public does not purchase such goods often.

Examples include [[snowshoe]]s, [[fire extinguisher]]s, [[flood insurance]], etc.

== Mergers and acquisitions ==

In the consumer product sector, there have been 107,891 deals announced between 1985 and 2018, which cumulates to a total value of around US$5,835 billion. 2007 was the year with the largest value (US$4,888 billion) followed by a steep slump in 2009 (-70.9%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://imaa-institute.org/m-and-a-by-industries/|title=M&amp;A by Industries - Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|work=Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first wave in 2007, now is the second big M&amp;A wave in the consumer products sector, and a decline is expected.

The '''Fishery Limits Act 1976''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (1977 c. 86) in order to implement the extension of fishing waters under the [[European Community]]'s [[Common Fisheries Policy]] into British law.

The Act extended the fishing limits from {{convert|12|nmi|lk=on}} to {{convert|200|nmi}} and was in force with the members of the EEC and nine other countries. [[Iceland]], with whom the [[United Kingdom]] had clashed over fishing rights in the so-called "[[Cod War]]", was not included due to separate negotiations with the EEC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3657">A '''franchise tax''' is a government levy (tax) charged by some [[US states]] to certain business organizations such as [[corporations]] and [[partnerships]] with a nexus in the state.  A franchise tax is not based on income.  Rather, the typical franchise tax calculation is based on the [[net worth]] of or capital held by the entity. The franchise tax effectively charges corporations for the privilege of doing business in the state.&lt;ref name="Iowa Survey"&gt;https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/IR/951.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chron.com"&gt;http://smallbusiness.chron.com/corporate-franchise-tax-vs-income-tax-66247.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nexus==
Whether or not a business must pay a franchise tax to a state in which it does business can cause some confusion. Some states report using both the economic and physical presence tests, and in some states, there are no written, public interpretations of their test at all.&lt;ref name="Baker Tilly"&gt;Baker Tilly, 2016 Midyear State and Local Tax Update. http://www.bakertilly.com/insights/midyear-state-and-local-tax-update-income-and-franchise-taxes/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quill==
The physical presence test is based on [[Quill Corp. v. North Dakota]], ( 504 U.S. 298 (1992)), a United States Supreme Court ruling concerning use tax. Quill Corporation is an office supply retailer. Quill had no physical presence in North Dakota (neither a sales force, nor a retail outlet), but it had a licensed computer software program that some of its North Dakota customers used for checking Quill's current inventories and placing orders directly. North Dakota attempted to impose a use tax on Quill, which was struck down by the Supreme Court, because Quill had no physical presence in North Dakota.

The ''Quill'' physical presence test is used by some states to determine whether or not a company must pay franchise tax. Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Texas report using the physical presence test.&lt;ref name= "Baker Tilly" /&gt;

==Economic Presence Test==
Many states apply an "economic presence" test to determine whether a business will be subject to state sales or franchise tax. This test, which seems to contradict Quill, implied that States have the right to tax or "nexus" solely on the basis that a company has sales or otherwise derives an economic benefit from activities within their borders.&lt;ref name= "Baker Tilly" /&gt;

==Amount==
About half the U.S. states do not impose a franchise tax.&lt;ref name="Journal of Accountancy"&gt;Journal of Accountancy, Navigating Nexus. http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2010/nov/20102904.html&lt;/ref&gt; For states that have a franchise tax, the amount is often either a flat fee or based on the size of the business's total holdings.&lt;ref name= "Chron.com" /&gt;

==Relationship To Corporate Tax==
States with higher [[Corporate tax#Taxable income|corporate income taxes]] usually have low or no franchise taxes and vice versa.

==Delaware==
The state of [[Delaware]] has a significant franchise tax.&lt;ref&gt;State of Delaware, Annual Report and Tax Information. https://corp.delaware.gov/frtax.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Other states have either nominal taxes or none at all.

'''Game Dev Tycoon''' is a business [[simulation video game]] developed by Greenheart Games, which first released on December 10, 2012.&lt;ref name="GreenHchat"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greenheartgames.com/game-dev-tycoon-changelog/ | title=Game Dev Tycoon Changelog | publisher=Greenheart Games | accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the game, the player creates and develops video games. ''Game Dev Tycoon'' was inspired by the iOS and Android game, ''[[Game Dev Story]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greenheartgames.com/about/ | title=About Greenheart Games | publisher=Greenheart Games | accessdate=2013-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; (by [[Kairosoft]]), and many critics find substantial similarities between the two games. ''Game Dev Tycoon'' was created by Greenheart Games, a company founded in July 2012 by brothers Patrick and Daniel Klug.

==Anti-piracy release==
The game's developers implemented a unique anti-piracy measure for ''Game Dev Tycoon''. Patrick Klug, founder of Greenheart Games, knowing that the game was likely to be torrented extensively, purposely released a cracked version of the game and uploaded it himself to torrent sites. Gameplay in this version is identical except for one variation, as players progress through the game they receive the following message:

{{quote
|Boss, it seems that while many players play our new game, they steal it by downloading a cracked version rather than buying it legally. If players don't buy the games they like, we will sooner or later go bankrupt.
|[[Greenheart Games]], ''Game Dev Tycoon''
}}

Eventually players of the cracked version will gradually lose money until they do go bankrupt, as a result of pirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://aussie-gamer.com/news/australian-game-developer-trolls-internet-pirates/ |title=Australian Game Developer Trolls Internet Pirates |publisher=Aussie-gamer.com |date=2013-04-30 |accessdate=2013-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214165241/http://aussie-gamer.com/news/australian-game-developer-trolls-internet-pirates/ |archivedate=2013-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; News site Ars Technica reported that some players complained on message forums about this piracy feature, unaware that it only appeared because they themselves pirated the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Orland|first1=Kyle|title=Game Dev Tycoon developers give pirates a taste of their own medicine|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/04/game-dev-tycoon-developers-give-pirates-a-taste-of-their-own-medicine/|accessdate=17 November 2016|work=Ars Technica|date=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progression==
The player starts out in a garage in the early 1980s during the [[golden age of arcade video games]] with no employees, limited money, and limited choices for the first game. As new games are created, new options are unlocked. When the first game engine is built, the player's game development skills improve. New consoles will also be released, and the player will be able to buy licenses for certain consoles, such as the GS, PlaySystem, mBox, and grPad which parody real life consoles and devices with different names due to trademark regulations. As the player progresses through the game further they have the opportunity to move to new offices and hire staff. After that further expansion is available, with players given the opportunity to open an R&amp;D lab when reaching certain requirements that host major projects, allowing the player to unlock things they wouldn't be able to otherwise, such as MMOs and online game shops similar to [[Steam (software)|Steam]], [[Uplay]], [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] etc. The player may also open up a Hardware Lab to create consoles and devices.

'''Gustave André Boël''' (18 May 1837 – 31 March 1912) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] industrialist and [[liberalism|liberal]] politician. He was the father of [[Pol Clovis Boël]].

==Career==
Boël was the son of farmers (Salasse farm), growing up with four brothers and a sister. Boël studied at the industrial school of Houdeng-Aimeries and in 1851, at the age of 14, started working at the ''Etablissements Ernest Boucquéau''. He became foreman of the factory and in 1865 he became plant manager. Ernest Boucquéau, at the edge of bankruptcy and faced with the refusal of his family to help him, asked Boël and his accountant to assist him in saving the company. They helped gather the necessary funds to finish the work he had started on the railroad tunnel between [[Enghien]] and [[Geraardsbergen]] of the [[railroad]] of [[Braine-le-Comte]] to [[Ghent]].

On 16 July 1880 Ernest Boucquéau died without leaving an heir and he bequeathed his fortune and his companies to Gustave Boël and his accountant. When the accountant died, Boël became the sole heir of the entire fortune and the factories. As of 1881, he modernized his companies and created an industrial group by taking participations in other companies, such as the steel factories ''Fabrique de Fer de Charleroi'' (Fafer) in  [[Charleroi]] and in Braine-le-Comte, coal mines and [[glass]] industry ''les Glaces de Moustier-sur-Sambre'' which would become [[Glaverbel]]. On 1 September 1888, Gustave Boël was one of the first in Belgium who established a participation in the profits for the employees of his factory. In 1912, the ''Etablissements Ernest Boucquéau'' would become the ''[[Usines Gustave Boël]]''.

==Political career==
Gustave Boël also inherited the liberal political and philosophical ideas of Boucquéau. As a progressive liberal, he embarked on a political career. On 11 October 1880, Boël became a member of the communal council of [[La Louvière]], and on 14 November of the same year he became [[alderman]]. On 4 May 1881, Boël became [[burgomaster]] of La Louvière. During his mandate, he supported many local initiatives and provided financial support for the construction of the hospital of La Louvière. In 1883, he resigned as burgomaster and became senator from 12 April 1883 until 8 July 1884. Asked by his liberal political friends, he again became senator on 14 June 1892 and from that moment onwards, Boël would stay senator for the [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal Party]] until his death in 1912.

The '''Internal Russian passport''' (officially in {{lang-ru|Паспорт гражданина Российской Федерации}}, commonly referred to as внутренний паспорт, общегражданский паспорт) is a mandatory [[identity document]] for all [[Citizenship of Russia|Russian citizens]] residing in Russia who are aged 14 or over. The Internal Russian passport is an [[Internal passport]] used for travel and identification purposes within Russia, which is distinct from the [[Russian passport|International Russian passport]] used to Russian citizens to travel in and out of Russian borders.

After the [[breakup of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the [[Passport system in the Soviet Union|Soviet Union internal passport]] continued to be issued until 1997, when it was replaced by the Russian internal passport. The current Russian internal passports were first issued in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.passport-collector.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/USSR_Russian-passports.pdf Russian passport history (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Russian Government]] is planning to replace the Internal Passport with a biometric, credit card size card. The [[Universal electronic card]] issued between 2013 and 2016 was planned to replace the Russian Internal passport as the sole national identity document for [[Citizenship of Russia|Russian citizens]] but was scrapped in early 2017.

==History==
{{noref section|date=December 2014}}
In 1992, passports – or other photo identification documents – became necessary to board a train. Train tickets started to bear passenger names, allegedly, as an effort to combat speculative reselling of the tickets.

On 9 December 1992, special pages were introduced which were affixed in Soviet passports, certifying that the bearer of the passport was a citizen of Russia. These pages were optional unless travelling to the other former Soviet republics which continued to accept Soviet passports; for other occasions, other proofs of citizenship were accepted as well. Issuance of the pages continued until the end of 2002.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

On 8 July 1997, the currently-used design of the Russian internal passport was introduced.&lt;ref&gt; Decree of the President of the Russian Federation from 13.03.1997 N 232 ‘About main identity document of the
citizen of the Russian Federation on the territory of the Russian Federation’ (Указ Президента РФ от 13.03.1997 №232 Об основном документе удостоверяющем личность гражданина Российской Федерации на территории Российской Федерации).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Soviet passports, which had three photo pages, the new passports only have one. A passport is first issued at the age of 14, and then replaced upon reaching the ages of 20 and 45. The text in the passports is in [[Russian language|Russian]], but passports issued in autonomous entities may, on the bearer's request, contain an additional page duplicating all data in one of the official local languages.

A deadline for exchanging old passports for the new ones was initially set at year-end of 2001, but then extended several times and finally set at 30 June 2004. The government had first regulated that having failed to exchange one's passport would constitute a punishable violation. However, the Supreme Court ruled to the effect that citizens cannot be obliged to exchange their passports. The Soviet passports ceased to be valid as means of personal identification since mid-2004, but it is still legal (though barely practical) to have one.

The ''[[Propiska in the Soviet Union|propiska]]'' was formally abandoned soon after adoption of the current [[Constitution of Russia|Constitution]] in 1993, and replaced with "[[Resident registration in Russia|residency registration]]" which, in principle, was simply notification of one's place of residence.

Nevertheless, under the new regulations, permanent registration records are stamped in citizens' internal passports just as were ''propiska''s. This has led to the widespread misconception that registration was just a new name for the ''propiska''; many continue to call it "''propiska''". This misconception is partly reinforced by the fact that the existing rules for registration make it an onerous process, dependent on the consent of landlords, which effectively prevents tenants of flats from registering.

Internal Russian passports are issued only inside the country. Russian citizens who live abroad can get internal passport only if they visit Russia, i.e., it is not possible to get internal passport in the [[List of diplomatic missions of Russia|Russian consulate abroad]]. In practice, Russian citizens who live abroad often do not get new internal passports at all, as the law allows them to prove their identity with an [[Russian passport|international Russian passport (travel document)]].

==Description==
[[file:RussianPassport.jpg|The First page of the Passport|thumb|right]]
[[file:Pasport RF.jpg|The bio data page / second page of the passport|thumb|right]]

Each passport has a data page and a signature page. A data page has a visual zone which contains a photograph of the passport holder, data about the passport, and data about the holder:

* Surname
* Given name and [[Patronymic]]
* Sex
* Date of Birth
* Place of Birth

Special mentions shall be made in the passport:

* on the registration of a citizen within a community/at a specific address and on removal from the registration records;
* on the military conscription of citizens who have attained 18 years of age;
* on the registration and termination of a marriage;
* for children under 14 years of age;
* for any previously issued basic identity documents of a citizen of the Russian Federation on the territory of the Russian Federation;
* for the extradition of the main documents of identity of the citizen of the Russian Federation outside the Russian Federation.

At the citizen's request, the passport may also include:

* the holder's blood type and the [[Rh factor]] (added by the medical facility where the citizen's blood type and Rh were tested, for example after a blood transfusion or donation);
* the holder's tax identification number.

Passport validity:
*Issued at or after 14 years of age - valid until the age of 20;
*Issued at or after 20 years of age - valid until the age of 45;
*Issued at or after 45 years of age - valid in perpetuity.

Upon reaching  the age of 20 and 45, the passport must be replaced. While undergoing military conscription, the passport can be issued or replaced at their place of residence at the end of the set period of military service.

==Replacement with identity cards==
In November 2010 [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|the Ministry of Internal Affairs]] announced the cancellation of internal passports with the aim of replacing them with plastic identity cards or [[Driver's license#Russia|driver's license]]s by 2025. Country-wide replacement was postponed until 15 March 2018 not to interfere with [[Russian legislative election, 2016|2016 Duma election]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://government.ru/docs/all/106198/?page=2 Russian Federal Government Decree №315 from 16.04.2016 (Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;. This date however places start of the campaign 3 days before the [[Russian presidential election, 2018|2018 Presidential election]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2897">The '''International Wheelset Congress''' ('''IWC''') was founded by [[Lucchini RS|Lucchini]] in 1963. The first congress took place in [[Bergamo]], [[Italy]], in that year. Since then, with only two exceptions it has been held every third year. The International Wheelset Congress is the oldest railway technical conference in the world. 

One of the premier international rail conferences, The International Wheelset Congress, attracts engineers from the international rail community. The congress provides a platform for rail operators, equipment builders, component suppliers, academia and government, regulatory and standards organisations. It is also a forum for dissemination of technology and advancements in the design and manufacture of rail [[Wheelset (rail transport)|wheelset]] components and their performance to promote increased productivity, performance and safety in rail operations.

==Recent meetings==
The 15th International Wheelset Congress was held in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]], in September 2007. The location of the congress is chosen worldwide according to a rotational rule. 

The 16th International Wheelset Congress was held at the [[Cape Town International Convention Centre]] in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], in March 2010. The event was hosted by Ringrollers Pty Ltd under the auspices of [[Union des Industries Ferroviaires Européennes]] (UNIFE) and ERWA.

The 17th International Wheelset Congress was held in [[Ukraine]] in 2013&lt;ref name="17iwc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.17iwc.com/ |title=Дополнительные ссылки |publisher=17 IWC |date= |accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was hosted by KLW-WheelCo. The main topic of the conference - new technologies increasing the operational life cycle of the wheelsets.

'''[[Netflix]]''' is a [[video on demand]] service which has expanded its business internationally from 2010 onwards.

== 2010: Canada ==
The company began offering streaming service to the international market on September 22, 2010 to Canada. At the time, Canadians could subscribe to Netflix for $7.99 a month, a rate that CEO Hastings called, "the lowest, most aggressive price we've ever had anywhere in the world."&lt;ref name="Canada Stumble"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Star Staff|last2=Canadian Press|title=Netflix stumbles as it launches in Canada|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2010/09/22/netflix_stumbles_as_it_launches_in_canada.html|website=Toronto Star|publisher=Toronto Star|accessdate=December 3, 2014|date=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the proclaimed low price, content selection in Canada was extremely limited. In 2012, data conducted by Josh Loewen for Canadian Business Online found that in the United States there were 10,625 unique titles in Netflix's library, whereas in Canada there were only 2,647.&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://netflix.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=363|title=Netflix To Launch Canadian Service|work=Netflix|date=July 19, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722042104/http://netflix.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=363|archivedate=July 22, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This could be blamed on differences in distribution deals in the United States and Canada. It is important to point out that from its beginning, Canadian Netflix has offered content not available in the United States. For example, a short-lived Fox sitcom, ''Running Wilde'' starring [[Keri Russell]] and [[Will Arnett]], began streaming on Canadian Netflix the same day it began airing in the United States on network television. The show streamed on Canadian Netflix because there was no Canadian broadcast partner, but was not available on US Netflix – becoming deemed a "Canada-only exclusive".&lt;ref name="Canada Ssepttumble"/&gt; Still, regardless of a limited streaming selection, it took the company less than a year to reach one million subscribers,&lt;ref name="Canada Million"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vlessing|first1=Etan|title=Netflix Canada Signs Up One Millionth Subscriber|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/netflix-canada-signs-up-one-219508|website=Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately three percent of Canada's population. Further, as of February 2014, there were approximately 5.8 million Canadians using Netflix, or 29% of Canada's English-speaking population. This number represents an increase in Canadian users by approximately 40% since 2012.&lt;ref name="canada 29"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oliveira|first1=Michael|title=Report finds 29 per cent of English-speaking Canadian subscribe to Netflix|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/tech_news/2014/02/04/report_finds_29_per_cent_of_englishspeaking_canadians_subscribe_to_netflix.html|website=Toronto Star|publisher=Toronto Star|accessdate=December 3, 2014|date=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2011: Latin America, Central America and Caribbean ==
On July 5, 2011, Netflix announced its plans to launch streaming service in Latin America,&lt;ref name="LA Expansion"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pepitone|first1=Julianne|title=Netflix expands to 43 new countries|url=http://money.cnn.com/2011/07/05/technology/netflix_international/|website=CNN Money|publisher=CNN Money|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; its largest expansion to date. At the time, Netflix had 23 million subscribers in the US and Canada.&lt;ref name="LA Expansion Stock"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cabot Investing Advice|title=Netflix Surges on Latin America Expansion News|url=http://www.cabot.net/News/2011/07/Netflix.aspx|website=Cabot Investing Advice|publisher=Cabot Investing Advice|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Entering the Latin American market meant Netflix had access to approximately 600 million people, or twice the number of people living in the United States.&lt;ref name="Why LA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lawler|first1=Ryan|title=Why Latin America is Netflix's next big market|url=https://gigaom.com/2011/07/05/netflix-latin-america-expansion/|website=Gigamon|publisher=Gigamon|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although high speed internet in Latin America is not as accessible as it in the United States and Canada, upon the announcement of its expansion to Latin America, Netflix stock immediately surged 8%, bringing the company to a record share price of $291.&lt;ref name="LA Expansion Stock" /&gt;

Beginning in September 2011, the company began its expansion to 43 countries and territories in Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean, offering content in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Brazil became the first country in Latin America to launch the service on September 5. There the service was offered at $BR14.99 or approximately $9.10 per month, making it more expensive than in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name="LA Rollout"&gt;{{cite web|last1=hdreport|title=Netflix begins Latin America rollout|url=http://hd-report.com/2011/09/06/netflix-begins-latin-america-rollout/|website=hdreport|publisher=hdreport|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=September 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rounding out the first five countries to launch streaming service in Latin America were Argentina, which followed on the 7th, Chile on the 8th, Colombia on the 9th, and Mexico on the 12th. Service spread to the other 38 countries in the following weeks. Among the content distributed to Latin America was programming from CBS, Miramax, and Showtime.

The launch in Latin America was not as successful as the company had hoped. While in Latin America, Netflix had no streaming competitors as it did in Canada, the digital divide (a lack of high broadband internet penetration) hindered rapid growth.&lt;ref name="Netflix LA Problems"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fritz|first1=Ben|title=Netflix faces problems in Latin America|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/16/entertainment/la-et-ct-netflix-latin-america20120516|website=LA Times|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Brazil, for example, only 20% of the population had an internet speed greater than {{nowrap|500 kB/s a second}}; {{nowrap|800 kB/s}} a second are needed to stream Netflix's content.&lt;ref name="LA Fox Deal"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frankel|first1=Daniel|title=Netflix continues Latin American content push with Fox deal|url=https://gigaom.com/2012/05/09/netflix-continues-latin-american-content-push-with-fox-deal/|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the lack of competitors in some ways slowed growth as well. Whereas in Canada new subscribers had been exposed to streaming content by other companies, the concept was newer to a wide Latin American audience, making some skeptical of the prospect.&lt;ref name="Netflix LA Problems" /&gt; A banking system unused to recurrent monthly transactions exacerbated the problem. Still, while Latin American expansion happened more slowly than expected, Netflix didn't lose money for the expansion and their Canadian expansion happened at a faster rate than expected, making their first two forays into the international market fairly successful. Additionally, despite the hindrances to growth in Latin America, Netflix continued in pursuit of content expansion, signing a deal with Fox in May 2012 (for a July 15 start) to make its popular content (e.g., ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', ''Glee, Bones, The X-Files, Wall Street'') available in the region.&lt;ref name="LA Fox Deal" /&gt;

== The 2011 controversy ==
The initial launches in Canada and in Latin America happened (albeit barely) before Netflix's 2011 controversy in the United States. In September of that year, the company decided to switch to two separate plans (one for streaming and one for DVD), hiked its prices accordingly, and attempted a move to two websites (one for streaming and one for DVD rentals). The change to its business model was accompanied by a loss of approximately one million American users and a plunging stock price. Prior to announcing the change to service stock was valued at just around $300, after the price it plunged to less than $53 a share.&lt;ref name="50 Mil"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steel|first1=Emily|title=Netflix, Growing, Envisions Expansion Abroad|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/22/business/media/netflix-says-it-topped-50-million-subscribers.html?_r=0|website=NY Times|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this debacle, Netflix had been having its most successful quarter, mainly due to the decision to expand to Latin America. The company quickly lost all the money it made in the quarter it announced growth to Latin America, was forced to apologize, and rethink its changing model.&lt;ref name="50 Mil" /&gt;

Bringing people back to Netflix after the 2011 snafu came in two forms.&lt;ref name="50 Mil" /&gt; First, it began work on producing its own original content –  announcing its adaptation of House of Cards in 2011 for a 2013 air date and its revival of Arrested Development in 2012 for a 2013 air date. Second, it continued international expansion – the originals were able to travel alongside its international expansion since Netflix, for the most part, retained complete control of their shows' distribution rights.

== 2012: United Kingdom, Ireland and Scandinavia ==
Netflix started its expansion to Europe in 2012, launching in the United Kingdom and Ireland on January 4.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news| title = Netflix launches UK film and TV streaming service| date = January 9, 2012| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16467432| accessdate = January 9, 2012|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October 18 it had expanded to Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.&lt;ref name="prnewswire.com"&gt;{{cite press release| title = Netflix Launches In Sweden, Denmark, Norway And Finland| date = October 18, 2012| url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/netflix-launches-in-sweden-denmark-norway-and-finland-174749581.html| accessdate = November 14, 2014|work=PRNewswire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Christof Baron, CEO of the international marketing group Mindshare, Netflix developed a strategy for its international expansion, "They start with a limited offer which doesn't cost them very much money and minimizes the risk. Then they collect very detailed data about what people like, and structure programming and investment around consumer behavior."&lt;ref name="Advertising Age"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Emma|title=Netflix Braves Cultural Barriers for European Expansion|url=http://adage.com/article/global-news/netflix-braves-cultural-barriers-european-expansion/295035/|website=Advertising Age|publisher=Advertising Age|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=September 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accounts for cultural taste differences and allows distribution deals to develop accordingly. By September 2013, Netflix had added token minimal content from [[Channel 4]], [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and the [[BBC]], many of which are early series, with subsequents never made available on Netflix.&lt;ref name="C4Wauto-8089252"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slinkystudio.info/reviews/2013/9/10/netflix-uk-review.html |title=Netflix UK Review |work=slinkystudio.info |date=September 10, 2013 |accessdate=March 8, 2014 |author= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308220718/http://www.slinkystudio.info/reviews/2013/9/10/netflix-uk-review.html |archivedate=March 8, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Netflix UK and Ireland reached its millionth subscriber faster than Netflix Canada, nabbing its millionth member by July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burke|first1=Elaine|title=Netflix celebrates one year in Ireland, gets set for a more original 2013|url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/new-media/item/30974-netflix-celebrates-one-year|website=Silicon Republic|publisher=Silicon Republic|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, BARB (Broadcasters Audience Research Board) reported Netflix as being extremely successful in the UK market. More than one in ten households in the country subscribed to the service by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Joe|title=Netflix Friend or Foe|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/329|website=Barb|publisher=Barb|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than twice as many people subscribed to Netflix than to Amazon Prime. As of the fall of 2014, Netflix had three million UK subscribers which was more twice as many as it had in 2013.&lt;ref name="Advertising Age" /&gt; Netflix is estimated to have over 300,000 subscribers in Ireland as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/media-and-marketing/jeremy-clarkson-puts-online-tv-race-into-top-gear-1.2876786|title=Jeremy Clarkson puts online TV race into top gear|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2013: Netherlands ==
Following the United Kingdom and Scandinavia, the next country in Europe to receive Netflix service was The Netherlands, on September 11, 2013. The Netherlands was the only country that Netflix expanded to in 2013, though, as the company decided to slow expansion to control subscription costs.&lt;ref name="6 March 2014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wallenstein|first1=Andrew|title=Netflix 2014 European Expansion: A Look Ahead|url=https://variety.com/2014/digital/news/netflix-makes-plans-to-move-into-europe-but-it-faces-fights-from-local-competitors-1201125910/|website=Variety|publisher=Variety|accessdate=December 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company spent $3 billion on subscription content that year.&lt;ref name="6 March 2014" /&gt; Kelly Merryman, the company's Vice President of Content Acquisition, revealed that shows that performed well on [[BitTorrent]] networks and other pirate sites were more likely to be offered as part of the expansion. Netflix's CEO further explained that illegal downloading helps to create demand, as users may switch to legal services for an improved user experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix makes it official, launches in The Netherlands|url=http://gigaom.com/2013/09/10/netflix-netherlands-launch/|work=GigaOM|publisher=GigaOM|accessdate=September 16, 2013|author=Janko Roettgers|date=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix Uses Pirate Sites to Determine What Shows to Buy|url=http://torrentfreak.com/netflix-uses-pirate-sites-to-determine-what-shows-to-buy-130914/|work=TorrentFreak|publisher=TorrentFreak|accessdate=September 16, 2013|author=ernesto|date=September 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final quarter of 2013, Netflix gained more new subscribers from its pool of countries than it did from the United States for the first time since it began its European expansion, making international expansion increasingly important. As media analyst Anthony Wible has been quoted as saying, "There are only so many people in the United States. The rest of the world is far bigger and the addition of domestic subscribers will start to slow down at some point."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hamel|first1=Mathilde|title=Netflix bets on international expansion to keep going|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101487231|website=CNBC|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2013, the company had reached approximately 32 million users in the United States and had additionally had approximately 10 million users internationally.&lt;ref name="Advertising Age" /&gt;

== 2014: Further European and ''India'' expansion ==
By September 19, 2014, the service was also available in [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Switzerland]]&lt;ref name="Netflix Media Centre"&gt;{{cite press release| title = Netflix now in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg | date = September 18, 2014| url = https://pr.netflix.com/WebClient/getNewsSummary.do?newsId=1593| accessdate = November 14, 2014|work=Netflix Media Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[India]].While reception throughout the rest of Europe and India was relatively warm, it was fairly hostile in France because of fears that the launch of Netflix would begin to ruin the country's "[[cultural exception]]" – its focus on culturally specific media. This led to Netflix's decision to create a series called ''Marseille'', essentially a remake of its hit series ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'' within a French context and one of the company's first non-English language shows.&lt;ref name="Advertising Age" /&gt;

Prior to its international expansion in 2010, Netflix's subscriber base grew on average by 2.4 million people a year. Following its arrival in Canada, Latin America, and eventually Europe, its subscriber base has grown on average by 7 million people a year,&lt;ref name=Expansion&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Dave|title=Chart of the Day: Netflix's Brilliant Expansion Plan|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-netflix-gets-a-huge-boost-from-international-expansion-2014-9|website=Business Insider|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; making international expansion key to Netflix's continued growth in the global marketplace. Notably, the company has over 20 original shows planned for release in 2015 and 2016. In that bunch are Netflix's first non-English language series.

In 2013, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine estimated that international streaming accounted for 15% of the company's value. Netflix has subscribed approximately 30% of households in the United States.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trefis Team|title=Sizing Up Netflix's International Subscriber Growth Potential|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2013/03/05/sizing-up-netflixs-international-subscriber-growth-potential/|website=Forbes|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; If able to replicate that in the United Kingdom and Scandinavia alone the company would add 12 million users.&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt;

In May 2015, Netflix revealed it was in talks with [[Jack Ma]]'s Wasu Media Holding and other partners to enter [[China]]'s online video market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Supriya Kurane |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/15/us-netflix-china-idUSKBN0O00AR20150515 |title=TITLE |publisher=Reuters |date=15 May 2015 |accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 6, 2015, Reed Hastings announced, in an interview with the Portuguese newspaper ''[[Expresso (Portugal)|Expresso]]'', that Netflix would enter the [[Italy|Italian]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]], and [[Spain|Spanish]] markets in October, and that it would install its [[Southern Europe]] support center (which will cover the previous three markets plus [[France]]) in [[Lisbon]], Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ramos |first=João |date=June 6, 2015 |title='Portugal terá Netflix em Outubro' |trans-title="Portugal will have Netflix in October" |url=http://leitor.expresso.pt/#library/expresso/semanario2223/economia-2223/temas/portugal-tera-netflix-em-outubro |language=Portuguese |issue=2223 |newspaper=[[Expresso (Portugal)|Expresso]] |location=Paço de Arcos |publisher=Impresa Publishing |pages=E20-E21 |access-date=June 6, 2015 | subscription=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2015–16: Further expansion into Asia, CES announcement ==
On September 9, 2015, Netflix announced that it would be continuing its expansion into Asia by launching in Pakistan, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan in early 2016, and the Philippines and Southeast Asia in the near future.&lt;ref name="asia2016"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflix-to-launch-in-south-korea-singapore-hong-kong-and-taiwan-in-early-2016-1|title=Netflix To Launch In South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong And Taiwan In Early 2016 | date=2015-09-09 | accessdate=2015-09-09|publisher=Netflix|website=netflix.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 6, 2016 at [[Consumer Electronics Show]], Netflix announced a major international expansion into 130 new territories; with this expansion, the company promoted that its service would now be available nearly "worldwide", with the only notable exclusions including Mainland China, and regions subject to U.S. sanctions, such as [[Crimea]], [[Syria]], and [[North Korea]]. The company also announced a partnership with [[LG]] to market pre-paid services in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.&lt;ref name=vb-130new&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix launches in 130 new countries, including India and Russia|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/01/06/netflix-launches-in-130-new-countries/|website=VentureBeat|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=engadget-nearlyevery&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix Everywhere: Live in nearly every country except China|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/01/06/netflix-teams-with-lg-for-prepaid-streaming-worldwide/|website=Engadget|publisher=AOL|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-netflixeverywhere&gt;{{cite news|title=Netflix announces it's now live in 130 new countries including India and Russia|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10724112/netflix-global-expansion-russia-india|accessdate=6 January 2016|work=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=recode-netflixnearly&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix Expands Into India, but Not China|url=http://recode.net/2016/01/06/netflix-expands-into-india-but-not-china/|website=Re/code|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnet-nearlyevery&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix goes live in 130 new countries|url=http://www.cnet.com/au/news/netflix-goes-live-in-130-new-countries/|website=CNET|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2017-: China deal ==
During the CES 2016 announcement, Hastings stated that any potential expansion into China could take "many years", owing to the tightly regulated state of the internet and media industries in the country. While the company admitted that some of its original productions (such as ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny]]'') were meant to appeal to a potential Chinese audience, Hastings stated that the company was in the process of building relationships with local partners that it could form a joint venture with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roettgers|first1=Janko|title=Netflix's China Expansion could take 'many years,' CEO Reed Hastings Cautions|journal=Variety|date=January 19, 2016|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/netflix-china-expansion-1201683349/|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rights to ''House of Cards'' had previously been sold to [[Sohu]], where it was a modest success, but was pulled by regulators.&lt;ref name="fortune-houseofcardscn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is House of Cards Really a Hit in China?|url=http://fortune.com/2014/03/04/is-house-of-cards-really-a-hit-in-china/|website=Fortune|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thr-iquyideal"/&gt;

On April 25, 2017, Netflix announced that it had reached a licensing deal with the [[Baidu]]-owned streaming service [[iQiyi]], although specifics of the deal were not announced, some Netflix original productions will be available on iQivi day-and-date with their premiere elsewhere.&lt;ref name="thr-iquyideal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix Signs Licensing Deal With China's iQiyi|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/netflix-signs-licensing-deal-chinas-iqiyi-997071|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jens Gram''' (15 November 1840 – 22 January 1912) was a Norwegian industrialist.

==Personal life==
He was born in [[Ask, Buskerud|Ask]] as a son of Johan Georg Boll Gram and Fredrikke Severine Mathea Stabell.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Gram, Jens|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|editor=Bull, Edvard |editor-link=Edvard Bull, Sr. |editor2=[[Einar Jansen|Jansen, Einar]]|edition=1st|first=S.

In July 1867 in [[Vadernes]] he married Julie Munch (1843–1928), daughter of [[P. A. Munch]]. They had two notable children, [[Johan Fredrik Gram]] and [[Mads Gram]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; Through Mads he was the father-in-law of art historian [[Irma Ingertha Gram]].&lt;ref name=snl2/&gt;

==Career==
He enrolled as a student in 1859, and also studied [[forestry]] in Germany a couple of years. When returning home he worked as manager of the family-owned forests. In 1871 he moved to [[Drammen]], where he was the [[consul (representative)|vice consul]] for [[Denmark]] from 1870 to 1906. He took over the company ''Nils Bache'' and renamed it ''Bache &amp; Gran''. Thorleif Bache was a co-owner, but pulled out ten years later. The company became important in the city's [[pulp and paper industry]], and Gram chaired ''Skandinavisk træmasseforening'' and ''Drammens trælasthandlerdirektion''. In 1900 he co-founded [[Norwegian Employers' Confederation]],&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; a predecessor of the [[Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Næringslivets Hovedorganisasjon|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/N%C3%A6ringslivets_Hovedorganisasjon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schell studied [[zoology]] and [[microbiology]] at the [[University of Ghent]], Belgium. From 1967  to 1995 he worked as a professor at the university. From 1978 to 2000 he was director and head of the [[Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research]] (Institut für Züchtungsforschung)  at the [[Max-Planck-Gesellschaft]] in [[Cologne]], Germany. He received many prizes, among which were the [[Francqui Prize]] in 1979, the [[Wolf Prize in Agriculture]] in 1990, and the [[Japan Prize]] in 1998, which he shared with [[Marc Van Montagu]].&lt;ref name=jp&gt;[http://www.japanprize.jp/en/prize_prof_1998_schell.html Prof. Dr. Jozef S. Schell]. japanprize.jp&lt;/ref&gt; He also was appointed Professeur Honoraire, [[Collège de France]], Paris in 1998. He was granted the title of Baron by Baudouin of Belgium.

Schell was a pioneer in genetics who focused on the interaction between plants and soil bacteria. Along with his colleague, [[Marc Van Montagu]], Jeff Schell discovered the [[Horizontal gene transfer|gene transfer]] mechanism between [[Agrobacterium]] and plants, which resulted in the development of methods to alter Agrobacterium into an efficient delivery system for gene engineering in plants. Besides being a prominent scientist, in 1982 he co-founded, with Marc Van Montagu, the successful [[biotech]] company [[Plant Genetic Systems]] Inc., now part of [[Bayer CropScience]].

==History==
===Founding (1994)===
Dov Seidman founded Legal Research Network (later changed to "LRN") two years out of Harvard Law School.&lt;ref name=TheWashingtonPost1995December11MintzJohn/&gt; Seidman's business plan was to offer legal knowledge and analysis services through an expert network of academics and lawyers.&lt;ref name="TheLosAngelesTimes2009July05HeiselWilliam"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heisel|first1=William|title=His Keen Sense of Ethics Has Paid Off Handsomely|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/05/business/fi-himi-seidman5|accessdate=6 February 2017|agency=Los Angeles Times|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|date=5 July 2009|location=Los Angeles, United States|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AmericanLawyer&gt;Osborne, D.M. ''American Lawyer'', "Should You Be Afraid of this Man?" June, 1995 (profile of Legal Research Network)&lt;/ref&gt; This research could then be repurposed in a database licensed to companies. He was able to pre-sell a $500,000 contract to MCI based on the idea.&lt;ref name=TheWashingtonPost1995December11MintzJohn/&gt; He raised $2 million from 42 investors to launch the company.&lt;ref name=haaretz /&gt;

In the first year, LRN had a network of 1,100 legal experts in over 2,500 subjects reported by the ''Washington Post'' as being "mostly law professors, solo practitioners and lawyers on leave from their regular jobs".&lt;ref name=TheWashingtonPost1995December11MintzJohn/&gt;

===Expansion into Training ===
The company added ethics and compliance training in the later 1990s as part of an effort to spread legal and ethical awareness throughout organizations, instead of just in their law departments.&lt;ref name=NLJ /&gt;&lt;ref name=jj /&gt; Online classes, starting in the 2000s,&lt;ref name=TheLosAngelesTimes2000January24VranaDebora/&gt; facilitated mass training of thousands of employees at large multi-nationals like [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] and [[Pfizer]].&lt;ref name=Fortune2 /&gt;  Pfizer trained all 150,000 of its employees with LRN courses.&lt;ref name=Fortune2 /&gt;   Subjects included complying with sexual harassment laws, trade secrets and anti-trust.&lt;ref name=NLJ /&gt;&lt;ref name=SF /&gt;

By the year 2000, 200 of the Fortune 500 companies were clients of LRN.&lt;ref name=Fortune2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SF /&gt; Starting in the early 2000s, the company offered "common standards" for ethics and corporate compliance education. Competitors like [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] and [[Pfizer]] shared as much of 90% of the course materials, helping to standardize best practices for business ethics in corporate America.&lt;ref name=Fortune2 /&gt;

Seidman testified in 2004 before the [[United States Sentencing Commission|U.S. Sentencing Commission]], regarding the [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines]], about the need for companies to develop ethical cultures instead of "check-the-box", compliance-only approaches.&lt;ref name=ZDNET /&gt;

Since 2008, LRN has been the corporate partner of The [[Elie Wiesel]] Foundation for Humanity’s Prize in Ethics Essay Contest, an annual competition for students to analyze ethical issues.&lt;ref name=ZDNET /&gt;

==Operations==
===Services===

LRN's services include analyzing corporate cultures, rewriting their codes of conduct, and providing ethical-compliance education and training to their employees.&lt;ref name=Fortune2 /&gt; LRN emphasizes principles and values rather than "blindly" following rules.&lt;ref name="CorporateSecretary2013December02BogoslawDavid"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bogoslaw|first1=David|title=Wayne Brody: Making the business case for E&amp;C|url=https://www.corporatesecretary.com/articles/compliance-ethics-csr/12591/wayne-brody-making-business-case-ec/|accessdate=10 June 2015|agency=IR Media Group Ltd|publisher=Corporate Secretary|date=2 December 2013|location=United States|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its online education platform offers about 500 courses in 50 languages, on topics including international corruption law, intellectual property, data protection, and environmental sustainability.&lt;ref name=Fortune2 /&gt; LRN ethics training materials include videos, blogs, quizzes, social media and video games.&lt;ref name="WSJ2014September26DiPietroBen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=DiPietro|first1=Ben|title=Turning Employees Into Ethics Believers|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2014/09/26/turning-employees-into-ethics-and-compliance-believers/|accessdate=8 June 2015|agency=Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=26 September 2014|location=United States|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dell told the [[Wall Street Journal]] in 2014 that LRN developed an ethics game for it entitled the "Honesty Project."&lt;ref name=WSJ2014September26DiPietroBen/&gt;

===Organization===
Job titles were largely eliminated from the company,&lt;ref name=WSJ1 /&gt; and "employee councils" handle major functions like recruiting and conflict resolution.

LRN was originally headquartered in California and moved its headquarters to [[New York City]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="WorkDesignMagazine2014September05BakerMila"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baker|first1=Mila|title=21st Century Organization Design: Integrating Work Environment, Work Experience, and Leadership|url=https://workdesign.com/2014/09/21st-century-organization-design-integrating-work-environment-work-experience-leadership/|accessdate=8 June 2015|agency=Workspace Design Magazine, LLC|publisher=Work Design Magazine|date=5 September 2014|location=United States|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also has offices in London and India.&lt;ref name="TheEconomicTimesOfIndia2012July20ChaturvediAnumeha"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chaturvedi|first1=Anumeha|title=LRN to Start Offering Its Services in India This Year|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-07-20/news/32764270_1_mission-statements-companies-innovation|accessdate=9 June 2015|agency=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co. Ltd.|publisher=The Economic Times Of India|date=20 July 2012|location=India|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Seidman published the book ''[[How (book)|How]]'', which discussed the business philosophy created at LRN.&lt;ref name=BestSeller /&gt; In it, he argues that companies that "outbehave" the competition will also outperform the competition financially.

===Finances===
It received a $30 million investment from Softbank in 2000.&lt;ref name="TheLosAngelesTimes2000January24VranaDebora"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vrana|first1=Debora|title=Southland's Attraction Grows for Large Internet Venture Firms|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jan/24/business/fi-57020|accessdate=8 June 2015|agency=Los Angeles Times|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|date=24 January 2000|location=Los Angeles, United States|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Baliuag,Bulacanjf9003 14.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Mang Inasal restaurant in Pulilan, Bulacan]]
The company was started by [[Edgar Sia]], who owned his first business at the age of twenty. Sia engaged in the food business at twenty-six years of age, opening the first Mang Inasal branch in December 2003 at the [[Robinsons Malls|Robinsons Mall]] Carpark in Iloilo City. The restaurant was an instant success, despite stiff competition from other, more established grilled-food restaurants.

The chain opened its first branches within the [[Visayas|Visayan region]], then expanded to neighboring [[Mindanao]] to the south before spreading to [[Metro Manila]]. Thereafter, the company started franchising in 2005. By 2008, Mang Inasal had opened 23 restaurants, with ten being franchised.&lt;ref name="tnt"&gt;{{cite web

In October 2010, 70% of Mang Inasal was acquired by [[Jollibee Foods Corporation]] (JFC), for {{Philippine peso|3 billion}} ($68.8 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Zinnia B.

A marketing communication tool can be anything from: [[advertising]], [[personal selling]], [[direct marketing]], sponsorship, communication, promotion and public relations.&lt;ref  name=tomse2014/&gt;

MC are made up of the [[marketing mix]] which is made up of 4P's: Price, Promotion, Place and Product, for a business selling goods, and made up of 7P's: Price, Promotion, Place, Product, People, Physical evidence and Process, for a service based business.&lt;ref&gt;Kusumawati, R.

==Overview==
Marketing communications includes [[advertising]], promotions, sales, branding and online promotion.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The process allows the public businesses use to know or understand a brand. Successful branding involves targeting audiences who appreciate the organization's  marketing program.

Advertising is a small but important part of marketing communications; the marketing communications mix is a set of tools that can be used to deliver a clear and consistent message to target audiences. It is also commonly called the promotional mix. Crosier (1990) states that all terms have the same meaning in the context of the 4ps: Product, price, place and promotion.&lt;ref name="tomse2014" /&gt; Price can send a message to the target audience. For example, comparing a $50 bag to a $10 bag, the former may be viewed as a luxury or more durable item.

The [[marketing plan]] identifies key opportunities, threats, weaknesses and strengths, sets objectives and develops an action plan to achieve marketing goals. Each section of the 4P's sets its own object; for instance, the pricing objective might be to increase sales in a certain geographical market by pricing their own product or service lower than their competitors. This creates a significant change in the market because more people of the target market would aim to do business with your organization  than your competitors, because pricing is one of the most significant aspects of marketing that can change the whole market positively and or negatively.

*Communication barriers: Communication barriers are factors that hinder the objectives of a marketing communication. Major communication barriers are: Noise and clutter, consumer apathy, brand parity and weak creative ideas or strategies. Noise is an unrelated sensory stimulus that distracts a consumer from the marketing message (for example, people talking nearby making it hard to hear a radio advertisement). Clutter is the high number and concentration of advertisements presented to a consumer at any time. As attention cannot be divided, there is a limit to how much can be taken in and processed, which means that a strong marketing communication needs to stand out from the clutter and be heard above the noise. (Ang, 2014. "Principles of Integrated Marketing Communications". Page 11.)
*Consumer apathy is the tendency of a consumer to avoid marketing communications. The consumer may not be interested, or consider themselves "in the market," and as such attempt to shut out the irrelevant marketing stimuli; this is known as selective attention. Alternatively, a consumer may be "in the market," yet not be aware of the brand or products existence or prevalence. Consumers tend to purchase familiar brands, and will not be inspired to investigate alternatives. One approach marketers use to overcome apathy is to create incentives, such as competitive pricing or loyalty rewards. (Ang, 2014. "Principles of Integrated Marketing Communications". Page 11.)
*Brand parity means a brand is not significantly different from its competition. Without a distinct value proposition, consumers do not develop brand preference or associations, and instead purchase purely based on price (Ang, 2014. "Principles of Integrated Marketing Communications". Page 12). This is not ideal, as effective marketing communication increases brand equity. One important objective of marketing communications is to develop a strong, unique brand identity that allows the brand to be positioned separate from its competition.
*[[Marketing mix]] is the most important part of marketing strategy, which is "the framework to manage marketing and incorporate it within a business context&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marketing Fashion, Second edition : Strategy, Branding and Promotion|last=Harriet|first=Posner|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;". 
*Marketing strategy: how a business achieves their marketing objectives.  The initial step to achieve a marketing strategy is to identify the market target and build up a plan that the business can implement.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==Communication==
Communication is one important aspect of the marketing mix.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Marketing|last=Doyle|first=Charles|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marketing communication is often the largest component of communication within a company, which may be to present company values, objectives or specific products and services to investors, customers or the general public. In the 21st century, communications objectives focus on more customized messages, targeting customer groups or individuals to create high responses and greater brand interaction.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

As business becomes increasingly global with greater access to Internet, mobile phones and social media, new challenges exist to inform people in targeted foreign markets. Shifts in the global economy and access to new markets lead also to greater demands for product shipping and associated services. To be effective, communication strategies must converge with marketing objectives while also accounting for local languages, dialects and cultural norms.

External communications might involve market research questionnaires, office website, guarantees, company annual report and presentations for investors.  Internal communication can be the marketing materials, price list, product catalogues, sales presentations and management communications.    On the other hand, each market demands different types of communications. For example, the industrial market demands a more personal communication but the consumer market demands non-personal communication.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

There are also 4 different fundamental types of communication.
*One-to-many:  this kind of communication is the most original communication.  It is "generated from a single broadcast point and then available over airwaves or in mass print runs&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;".   This type of communication is usually adapted to news distribution that does not specific not even interactive.  Such as in an urgent notice play over airwave from broadcast in an industry, it is helpful for the general announcement.
*Many-to-one: many-to-one is usually connected to the one-to-many communication.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  For example, a reply button in your email box, a prepaid number bought from Spark. All the communication techniques proceeded to the public with bi-directional communication from mass communications.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
*One-to-one: this is the most intensive and interactive communication at a one-to-one level.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  There are so many examples like a sales presentation; a negotiation in the market or direct delivery is base on the one-to-one communication.  Most of this communication is face to face. But in the development of Internet, email and online shopping are taking place the chance to face to face of people.  Which is provided the chance to sellers and buyers talk more directly.  Another important is instant message 'chat' channel like Wechat and Facebook, which are becoming extremely popular in business.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
*Many-to-many: on the background of highly developed Internet, the many-to-many communication has been growing up such as online chat rooms, 'blogging' websites.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The many-to-many communication stands for the participants are able to exchange their ideas and experiences.

One-to-one is more immediate, while the many-to-may channels tend to be less urgent but with greater longevity.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Psychology of communication=== 
One of the primary goals of a marketing communication is to persuade consumers, by either changing their perception of a brand, product or service, or persuading them to purchase (or feel motivated / tempted to purchase) a product or service. The "Elaboration Likelihood Model" is used to demonstrate how persuasion occurs. When a marketing communication message is sent out, first it must be acknowledged and attended by the receiver. By giving their attention to the marketing communication, consumers will begin to process and comprehend the message. There are two routes to persuasion: Central and peripheral. Central route processing is used in high-involvement purchase decisions. These are infrequent, high-risk purchases, usually involving large amounts of money and a significant amount of time (for example, purchasing a house or car). Because these purchase decisions are high risk, a large cognitive effort is expended in order to rationally select the most logical and valuable option available. In these marketing messages, information about the product or service itself is most valuable. 
Peripheral route processing is employed in low involvement purchase decisions. These are frequent, low-risk purchases, generally of a low or medium cost in which choices are made more on affective (or emotion based) values rather than cognitive (or rational) values. Because of this, marketing messages will employ more storytelling and imagery, focusing on how the product or service makes one feel, and the associations it has, rather than the attributes and specifications it possesses.

==Communication process==
[[File:Transactional comm model.jpg|Transactional Model of Communication|thumb|270px]]
[[Communication]] can be defined as process of using, word, sound or visual cues to supply information to one or more people.&lt;ref&gt;*Communication. (n.d.). ''Merriam-Webster.'' Retrieved from http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/communication&lt;/ref&gt; A communication process is defined as information that is shared with the intent that the receiver understands the message that the business intended to send.&lt;ref&gt;Communication process. (n.d.). ''Business Dictionary.'' Retrieved from http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/communication-process.html&lt;/ref&gt; The communication process was once thought of as having the source of the message, which is then [[encoding|encoded]], put through the chosen [[communication channel]], which is then [[Code|decoded]] by the recipient and then received.&lt;ref name=belch2012/&gt;  Throughout the middle of the channel there is the potential for noise to distort the message being sent.&lt;ref name=belch2012/&gt;  Once the receiver has the message they then give feedback to the original source, where they then find out whether the campaign has been successful or not.&lt;ref name=belch2012/&gt;

With the prevalent use of technology, customers are seeking out information about brands, products and businesses prior to purchase.&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, D. C., &amp; Singer, M. (2015). Competing on Customer Journeys. ''Harvard Business Review, 93''(11), 88-100&lt;/ref&gt; This means that there is a need for an additional channel within the communication process, so it is a more accurate representation of the current business environment. Businesses are now having to take into consideration that both opinion leaders and opinion formers who have a great influence over today's society and their perceptions. So they have to be included into the communication process before the recipient of the message receives it.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, L., Zhao, J., &amp; Xu, K. (2016). Who creates Trends in Online Social Media: The Crowd of Opinion Leaders? ''Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 21''(1), 1-16&lt;/ref&gt;

This model is more effective when there is common ground between the senders and receivers so they can communicate effectively. Choosing the appropriate source helps develop the message and appeal to the targeted audience. The source will be more effective if they are relatable to the target audience. This realm of understanding is represented by the overlapping circles. The more knowledge the source has about who they are targeting, the better they can understand how the receiver may interpret or react to the message.&lt;ref name=belch2003/&gt;

The components of the transactional model are:
*'''Source:''' The source is an individual or organization that has information to share. The source (or sender) creates and sends the information to another person or group of people. The source maybe an individual (e.g. a sales person or spokesperson) or a non-personal identity (e.g. a corporation or organization). The communication process begins with the source, marketers must carefully choose a source as it affects how the message will be perceived by the target audience.&lt;ref name=belch2003&gt;Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A. (2003). ''Advertising and promotion: An integrated marketing communications perspective''. The McGraw− Hill. Retrieved from, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://202.74.245.22:8080/xmlui/handle/123456789/54&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Encoding:''' This is transposing the intended meaning of the message with words, symbols or pictures to show a message. Encoding is the development of the message that contains the information the source hopes to convey. It is putting together the thoughts, ideas and information into a symbolic form that can be transmitted and understood by the receiver.&lt;ref name=belch2003/&gt; Encoding the message is the second step in the communication process. The encoding process leads to development of a message that contains the information or meaning the source hopes to convey. Encoding is extremely important, it is a brain activity that takes effect when the receiver makes sense of a brand message or idea used to convey meaning: words, colour, pictures, signs, symbols or even music. The message may be verbal or nonverbal, oral or written, or symbolic (e.g. the sound of a brass band being redolent of simpler times or heritage). or it can often include 'cues' such as the Nike 'swoosh' which indicates success. Often things can get in the way of the "correct" encoding and the interpretation of the intended message (decoding). There are methods the sender can use to make sure the receiver interprets the message correctly, these methods include; channels, consumer insights, having similarities with the receiver and frame of reference (e.g. age, values, culture).&lt;ref name="belch2012"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advertising and promotion: An integrated marketing communications perspective (9th ed.)|last=Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A.|publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin.|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it is extremely important for the sender to get to know its receiver and this is accomplished through research for targeting strategy. These concepts help craft the intended message in the minds of the consumer.

*'''Message''': The message comes from the encoding process, it is the content, meaning or information the sources hopes to convey. The message can be in many forms such as verbal, non-verbal, oral, written or symbolic.&lt;ref name=belch2003/&gt;

*'''Channel''': The channel is the method by which the communication travels from the source or sender to the receiver.&lt;ref name="belch2012" /&gt; There are two types of channels, personal and non-personal. Personal channels of communication are direct and target individual groups. Personal communication channels are connected with two or more persons who communicate directly with each other face-to-face, person-to-person through telephone, email or fax. Social channels also fall under the category of personal communications. Friends, neighbors, associates, co-workers, or family members are all means of social channels.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business communication (7th ed)|last=Krizan, A., Merrier, P., Logan, J., Williams, K.|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=|location=Canada|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carrying a message without interpersonal contact between sender and receiver is known as non-personal channels of communication. Mass media or mass communications are examples of non-personal channels, since the message is sent to many individuals at one time. Non-personal channels of communication are made up out of two main types, the first being print. Print media includes newspapers, magazines, direct mail, and billboards. The second type is broadcast; broadcast media includes radio and television.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Modica, T., Hoffmann, K.|date=2010|title=Formal Modeling of Communication Platforms using Reconfigurable Algebraic High-Level Nets|url=http://journal.ub.tu-berlin.de/eceasst/article/view/426/417|journal=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Decoding:''' The receiver unravels the symbols to interpret what is being communicated. Transforming the sender's message back into thought. This is influenced greatly by the receiver's frame of reference (or realm of understanding) which involves their values, attitudes and state of mind when receiving the message. For the model to be effective the decoding by the receiver would match the encoding by the source, meaning they correctly understand the message that was sent.&lt;ref name=belch2003/&gt; Decoding is the process of interpreting messages and relies on correct encoding and the ability of the receiver to deconstruct transmitted meaning. Decoding occurs when the message reaches one or more of the receiver's senses. Consumers both hear and see television ads, others consumers handle (touch) and read (see) an advertising offer (e.g. coupon). According to Belch &amp; Belch this process is deeply influenced by the receiver's frame of reference or field of experience, which refers to the experiences, perceptions, attitudes, and values he or she brings to the communication situation.&lt;ref name="belch2012" /&gt; For effective communication to occur, the message decoding process of the receiver must match the encoding of the sender. Over this entire means the receiver comprehends and correctly translates what the source is trying to communicate. Effective communication is more likely to emerge when there is some common ground between the two parties. The more familiarity the sender has about the receivers, the better the sender can understand their needs, commiserate with them, and over all communicate more effectively.

*'''Receiver''': The individual (s) that the source shares thoughts or information with. The receiver hears, sees or reads the message and decodes it.

*'''Noise:''' Noise is any external interference during this communication process. Any external factors that creates unplanned distortion. This distortion can make it difficult for the receiver to interpret or assign meaning to a message as it was intended by the source. Examples of noise in the encoding of the message could be lack of radio or television signal. Noise can also occur when the sender and receivers fields of experience do not overlap, if there is no common ground between them, which may result in a misunderstanding in the meaning of the message.&lt;ref name=belch2003/&gt; Throughout the communication process, the message is subject to irrelevant factors that can distort or interfere with its reception. Noise is the physical or Psychological fundamentals either from inside or outside of the process of communication. Noise acts as a barrier as it makes the message less accurate, less productive and unclear. It may even prevent the message from ever reaching the receiver. Physical noise is often triggered by badly made images or messages (e.g. poor print quality) or elements of distraction (e.g. consumer scrolling through TV advertisements). Psychological noise could be mixed meanings, poor credibility of source or the insignificance of the message to the consumer requirements. Not having a connection with the receiver and lacking in common ground usually cause this. This may result in unsuitable encoding of the message such as; using a sign, symbol, or word that is unfamiliar or has different meaning to the receiver (e.g. sending a message in foreign language that is not understood by the receiver). The more common ground there is between the sender and the receiver, the less likely it is for noise and barriers to interrupt a message.&lt;ref name="belch2012" /&gt;

*'''Response/Feedback''': The receiver's reaction to the message provides feedback to the sender. This is the set of reactions after seeing, hearing or reading the message. The receiver's response is the feedback and lets the sender know how the message was decoded and received. A form of feedback in an interpersonal selling situation could be questions, comments or any reactions (such as expressions) about the message. In mass media an indication of how the marketing communications were perceived is the amount of sales after the message has been sent. There are many different ways such as attitude change, store visits and inquires that provide feedback in mass media. Feedback can help to improve the communication process and the success of future messages.&lt;ref name=belch2003/&gt; The receiver's particular type of reactions after seeing, hearing, or reading a message is known as a response. Receivers' responses can range from either non noticeable actions or noticeable actions. Non noticeable responses can be storing their information in memory and noticeable responses are immediate action such as dialing the commercials number to order a product advertised on television. One of the main goals of communication is receiving appropriate receiver responses, feedback closes the loop in the communications flow and lets the sender monitor how the intended message is being decoded and received. To achieve this goal one can ask indirectly or directly for the response, or assist the receiver in giving the response.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Receiving feed back can be more difficult for parties that advertise through the channels of mass media, because advertisers are not in direct contact with their customers so other methods must be obtained to determine how their messages have been received. While the critical form of feedback happens through sales, it is often hard to show a direct relationship between advertising and purchase behavior. So marketers; visit stores, check coupon redemption, use reply cards and listen to customer inquiries to achieve feedback. Once a significant amount of feedback/response study has been gathered advertisers would then have enough information to determine reasons for success or failure in the communication process and from there they can make appropriate adjustments.

===Opinion leaders and opinion formers===
[[Opinion leader]]s are consumers who have large influence over the purchasing behaviour of other consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Opinion Leaders. (n.d.). ''Business Dictionary.'' Retrieved from http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/opinion-leaders.html&lt;/ref&gt; These can be peers or celebrities, and often represent a "desired state" in the eye of the influenced consumer. By following the consumption patterns of opinion leaders, consumers aspire to achieve a similar status or lifestyle, and project a similar image. Because of this, opinion leaders are powerful factors in marketing communications. Having opinion leaders endorse a brand can increase brand awareness and sales. Due to this, large companies pay highly influential celebrities to endorse their products.

You can receive the opinion leaders' thoughts or feeling towards the product/service through paid advertising, social media, blogs, or any other form of written media.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://evconsumerbehaviour.angelfire.com/opinion-leaders-formers-followers.html|title=Opinion leaders, formers &amp; followers|date=|website=evconsumerbehaviour|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can be direct, or indirect influences.

[[Opinion Former]]s are consumers who are regarded by their peers as being highly knowledgeable and trustworthy.&lt;ref&gt;Opinion Formers. (n.d.). ''Business Dictionary.'' Retrieved from http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/opinion-formers.html&lt;/ref&gt; They are considered experts in selecting the highest quality products due to their extensive knowledge, and as such are able to influence the purchasing behaviour of other consumers despite lacking the celebrity status of an opinion leader. They have specialized knowledge about the area which corresponds with the product, service or business. For example, this could be a doctor sponsoring a form of medication, or a personal trainer recommending a sports brand to the customer.  This means that both opinion leaders and opinion formers have a large influence on the consumer and their perceived view of the business, product, or service provided.&lt;ref name=stehr2015/&gt; If a brand is specializing in the sale and manufacturing of makeup products, the business would want to look at someone who is both known for their knowledge about makeup and also someone who they know is popular within that community, so that the message is as wide spread throughout their target market as possible.&lt;ref name=stehr2015&gt;Stehr, P., Rossler, P., Leissner, L., &amp; Schonhardt, F. (2015) Parasocial Opinion Leadership Media Personalities'' Influence within Parasocial Relations: Theoretical Conceptualization and Preliminary Results. ''International Journal of Communication (19328036)'', 9982-1001&lt;/ref&gt;
Opinion leaders add another link in the communication process, acting as a "meaning filter" for the receivers of the message (Dahlen, 2010). The message is sent from the sender and the opinion leaders share their opinions with the targeted audience.

===Adjusted model of communications===
The core model of communication has been criticized for its linearity – sender, message, receiver and its absence of structural perception.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, S. (1980). Encoding/decoding. ''Culture, media, language'', 128-138. Retrieved from, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.hu.mtu.edu/~jdslack/readings/CSReadings/Hall_Encoding-n-Decoding.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since then an adjusted model of communication has developed.

The adjusted model of communication was developed within a marketing context, when marketers saw that people were affected more by influential homophilous groups (family and friends) and heterophilous groups (outside the person's network) than mass media (Dahlen, 2010).

The adjusted model is different to the core model of communication because it incorporates opinion leaders also known as gate keepers.

== Mass media ==
===Television===
{{main|television advertising}}
Television has since its inception dominated the advertising media scene, due to its combination of visual and aural stimulation, allowing for greater attention grabbing and more effective transmission of messages than other forms of media. It has a few disadvantages: television commercials suffer from being "zipped" and zapped". "Zipping" is the term given to fast forwarding commercial break sessions during the pre-recording of programs. Often viewers will record programs purely so they can be viewed without the commercial breaks. "Zapping" is the term given to the habit of many consumers to change channels during commercial breaks. This is also done to avoid watching advertisements. Using television advertisements is beneficial due to its wide reach and the degree to which content can be segmented according to the intended target market. Advertisements are carefully paired with time segments and / or linked with appropriate programming, known as "media vehicles". This helps to ensure the intended audience is being reached with the marketing message.&lt;ref name=Ang14&gt;Ang, 2014. "Principles of Integrated Marketing Communications".&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|118}}

While initial production costs of a television advertisement are high, it is likely to reach a mass audience and, therefore, maintains a low cost per viewer, making it an efficient communication platform.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

===Radio===
{{main|radio advertising}}
Radio by definition is the broadcasting of sound programmes to the public and today can be live streamed through a broadband connection or digitally transmitted into people's cars or homes.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuyucu|first=Mihalis|date=October 2014|title=From Analog to Digital Radio Management: The New Radio and New Media|url=http://www.ojcmt.net/articles/44/444.pdf|journal=Online Journal of Communication and Media Technologies|volume=4|issue=4|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being the oldest form of media transmission still being used, marketing via radio remains a popular and effective choice due to its relatively lower cost and convenience (radio exposure can occur during transit, at work, and during recreational activities). Due to the lack of a visual aspect, radio advertising attempts to create imagery in the consumers mind. Radio advertising is also extremely effective at reinforcing messages encountered in other channels (such as television).&lt;ref name=Ang14/&gt;{{rp|122}} A familiar jingle or voice associated with a brand enhances brand and ad awareness, ultimately increasing brand equity. This is an example of "Integrated Marketing Communications", in which multiple marketing channels are simultaneously utilized to increase the strength and reach of the marketing message. Like television, radio marketing benefits from the ability to select specific time slots and programmes (in this case in the form of radio stations and segments within).

Fill et al.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; argue that radio communication promotes "emotional consumer–centric associations" as each listener is forced to construct a visual representation of the words and sounds such as music in their minds. A common technique used by companies is known as imagery transfer, where a complementary visual television advertisement is used alongside a one-dimensional radio advertisement featuring a similar audio track to stimulate a visual association between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Advertising|author1=Arens, William |author2=Arens, Christian |author3=Weigold, Michael |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2011|isbn=|edition=13|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests this sub-conscience relational thought process greatly benefits future brand recognition and awareness.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Radio infomercials are often a simple script that is read out by the presenter. This is quick and does not require extensive lead times due to minimal production efforts.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

===Print===
[[Printed media]] is the most basic form of media advertising. It is the most challenging to create strong imagery with, due to its lack of sensory stimulation, but can be effective in efficient, clear information communication and message delivery. Where a consumer may miss a message in video or audio (perhaps a loud noise interrupts, or someone blocks their view) in print the message remains visible indefinitely. Aspects such as size, colour and style can be used to increase effectiveness relative to other print advertisements, which is important as despite being a basic media communication channel, print is the second largest medium after television (Ang, 2014. "Principles of Integrated Marketing Communications". Page 126.).

Traditionally, marketing communications practitioners focused on the creation and execution of printed marketing collateral. Traditional media, or as some refer to as old media, has been used within the marketing and advertising world for many years.&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Belch, &amp; Belch|title=Advertising and promotion: An integrated marketing communications perspective|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston, M.A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional media encompasses conventional forms of advertising media, such as television, magazines, newspapers, radio, and direct mail and outdoor.  For many decades, these forms of communication have been the main source for marketers to reach both consumers and other companies. In a world with no internet and the vast world of social media, roots of advertising and promotion lie within traditional media, where there is a more direct, physical way of advertising.

Advertising in the form of print is used by businesses in the form of billboards, magazines, newspapers and posters, to get their message across to the target audience. Businesses will usually place a billboard in areas where in can be easily seen and where the target audience will spend their daily activities. Newspaper, magazines and posters are smaller in size and can be found in numerous places allowing the general public availability to read them. Depending on the product or service that is being advertised, marketers may specify where majority of their prints may go to, such as advertisement of a new shampoo may be more common within salons.

Print media are a highly customizable, varying in print size, font, positioning and colour combination. Newspapers commonly use coarse paper and tend to have poor reproduction quality, while magazines can enhance the appearance of a certain product due to the heavy weight gloss paper used which translates colour well and offers a long lasting quality and likeability.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Magazines function as a frame, a psychological device which manipulates perspective and judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Barnes, James H |author2=Reid, Leonard N |author3=Rotfield, Herbert J |date=1984|title=Attention to Magazine Ads as Function of Layout Design|url=|journal=Journalism Quarterly|volume=62|issue=2|pages=439–441|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Vogue, a leading paid circulation fashion magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=David|date=2014|title="That's part of what we do" The Performance power of Vogue's Anna Wintour|url=https://cjdept.unm.edu/research/recent/docs/weiss-thats-part-of-what-we-do-chapter-2014.pdf|journal=Journal of Magazine and New Media Research|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–29|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; publishes advertising efforts alongside beautiful imagery and elegant photography, the association of the two communicates respectability and sophistication and promotes the creditability of the brands which appear in the same publication. Due to the high-quality reproduction, magazines tend to last longer and are often found in hair salons and waiting rooms. Consumers often cut out individual images which further prolongs the message and increases potential exposure. Although the relevance of the message may be lost during this extended time, brand awareness may still be raised.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; {{repetition|date=January 2017}}

Magazines are often segmented by subject such as women's health, automotive or fashion and therefore effectively reach a particular target market while newspapers focus on geographical regions which tend to appeal to a broad representative population sample and, therefore, offer low impact in selectivity. Newspapers are often run on a weekly schedule offering up to date information and coverage of local events and businesses as a lower coast alternative. Such advertisements in smaller typeface and are black and white.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

===Decline===
Traditional media is gradually losing effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trusov, Bucklin, &amp; Pauwel|title=Effects of Word-of-Mouth Versus Traditional Marketing: Findings from an Internet Social Networking Site.|journal=Journal of Markerting|date=2009|volume=73|issue=5|pages=90–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change is driven by two key factors: audience fragmentation and ability to choose commercial content. Television, radio, magazines, and newspapers are becoming more fragmented and reaching smaller and more selective audiences.  The rapid growth of communication due to interactive media, particularly the internet have caused the changes in the use of communication through media, with businesses preferring to use modern media over more traditional media methods. Consumers cannot avoid new and innovative ways of communication.&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill"/&gt; Many marketers believe that traditional methods of advertising have become too expensive and is not cost-effective compared to modern media. Traditional forms of marketing communications such as advertising are one way in nature, whereas new media allows marketers to perform a variety of functions.

==Communication platforms==
Communication platforms like Skype, Facebook or other types of media have become extremely important means of communication. Although there are other methods of communications that aren't just related to [[social media]], people can also be hugely influenced by their peers, this process is known as social mediation.  Marketing Communication Platforms are a powerful capability for personalizing and expending marketing contents in an automated fashion based on the profile of the recipients.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A [[wiktionary:platform|platform]] by simplest definition is a raised floor or stage. It functions as a similar principle in marketing communications, providing awareness and information about a specific brand or product.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marketing Communication: A brand narrative approach |author1=Dahlen Michael |author2=Lange Fedrick |author3=Smith Terry |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2010 |url=https://autonline.aut.ac.nz/bbcswebdav/pid-3617607-dt-content-rid-6697168_3/orgs/BUS_BK_MARKETIns/603/Dahlen_w2.pdf |isbn= |location=West Sussex, UK |pages= }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strategic selection of various communication platforms is known as a media strategy which aims to engage an audience in a meaningful conversation and, as a result, create a lasting relationship.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Consumer-Centric Marketing|last=Cundari|first=Aldo|publisher=Wiley|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern technology has expanded the use of platforms and ways in which consumers and the brand can interact. As a result, the context of platforms and how they are defined has changed.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=Michael D.|last2=Long|first2=Mary M.|last3=Chiagouris|first3=Larry G.|last4=Gopalakrishna|first4=Pradeep|date=2011-04-01|title=Transitioning from Traditional to Digital Content: An Examination of Opinion Leadership and Word-of-Mouth Communication across Various Media Platforms|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15332861.2011.571990|journal=Journal of Internet Commerce|volume=10|issue=2|pages=91–105|doi=10.1080/15332861.2011.571990|issn=1533-2861}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various platforms by which communication is transmitted,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advertising Strategy, Creativity and Media|author1=Fill, Chris |author2=Hughes, Graham |author3=De Francessco, Scott |publisher=Pearson|year=2013|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these can be categorised as paid, owned, earned and shared, formally named as the integrated communication triangle by Grönroos and Lindberg-Repo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Finne|first=Åke|last2=Grönroos|first2=Christian|date=2009-07-01|title=Rethinking marketing communication: From integrated marketing communication to relationship communication|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13527260902757654|journal=Journal of Marketing Communications|volume=15|issue=2-3|pages=179–195|doi=10.1080/13527260902757654|issn=1352-7266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model acknowledges that communication must be credible and trustworthy to be effective. Studies reveal many consumers look at review forums and ask friends or peers whom they trust for ratings on products before making a purchase decision.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Therefore, effective communication relies on an integrated approach of one dimensional and interactive platforms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marketing communications: A brand narrative approach|last=Dahlen, M., Lange, F., &amp; Smith, T|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons.|year=2010|isbn=|location=West Sussex, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explicitly planned market content is communicated through non-personal communication platforms.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Muller, Richard |author2=Wergin, Rand |date=2012|title=A case study in marketing communications: Traditional vs e-media advertising|url=|journal=International Journal of the Academic Business World|volume=6|issue=1|pages=85–94|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand is in control of the platform, message content, frequency and repetition of the communication message.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Andreas M.|last2=Haenlein|first2=Michael|date=2010-01-01|title=Users of the world, unite! The challenges and opportunities of Social Media|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681309001232|journal=Business Horizons|volume=53|issue=1|pages=59–68|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2009.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is typically accomplished through traditional paid platforms, such as, print, electronic, outdoor and alternative media, that aims to target a mass segment of the target market.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Other aspects of noise decrease the effectiveness of message penetration, for example, most paid communication platforms, print and electronic media are filled with marketing and advertising messages and are subject to clutter, often forcing brands to compete for attention.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; To eliminate noise brands often choose to include inserts such as samples and scent strips within magazines while newspapers utilise "call to action" inserts such as coupons which encourage consumers to visit or try a local service or good.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

==Guerrilla marketing==
Due to the rise in advertising clutter, there has been a push for non-traditional media such as [[guerrilla marketing]].&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Micael Dahlén|last2=Anton Granlund|last3=Mikael Grenros|date=2009-05-01|title=The consumer-perceived value of non-traditional media: effects of brand reputation, appropriateness and expense|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/07363760910954091|journal=Journal of Consumer Marketing|volume=26|issue=3|pages=155–163|doi=10.1108/07363760910954091|issn=0736-3761}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guerrilla Marketing is usually a low-cost way of generating buzz through creative or unexpected communication platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tam Duc Dinh|last2=Khuong Ngoc Mai|date=2015-12-21|title=Guerrilla marketing's effects on Gen Y's word-of-mouth intention – a mediation of credibility|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/APJML-06-2015-0102|journal=Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics|volume=28|issue=1|pages=4–22|doi=10.1108/APJML-06-2015-0102|issn=1355-5855}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outdoor settings provide potential ground to gain attention from a large audience. An example is customizing street infrastructure or creating an event such as a flash mob. Research rates guerrilla advertising as having a higher perceived value compared to other communication platforms, which tends to result in a positive consumer response.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; An example of successful guerrilla marketing was created by Volkswagen (VW) in their promotional "driven by fun" campaign, where consumers could use VW "fast lane" slide instead of the escalator to get to the bottom of the stairs faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.creativeguerrillamarketing.com/guerrilla-marketing/volkswagens-new-guerrilla-campaign-encourages-people-to-try-the-fast-lane/|title=Volkswagen's New Guerrilla Campaign Encourages People To Try The 'Fast Lane'|website=Creative Guerrilla Marketing|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Touch points==
Every point of contact is a form of communication and it is, therefore, necessary to consider touch points as a communication platform. Touch points can be either physical or a human interaction between a brand and the consumer which influence customer decision-making process during pre-purchase, purchase and post-purchase.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Chris|date=2003|title=Brand touchpoints|url=|journal=Information Outlook|volume=7|issue=11|pages=38|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many ways in which a customer may interact with a business.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Interactions occur through direct customer service exchanges, a company website, the point of purchase environment and product packaging or performance.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; These all contribute to consumer perceptions of a particular brand. For instance, the service-scape of a purchase touch point such as a retail store can influence the perception of quality and service through lighting and layout or other sensory touch points, for example smell.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; [[Fast fashion]] retailers such as Topshop maintain a white store interior and exterior which is perceived as luxurious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Visual Merchandising: Window and In-Store displays for Retail|last=Morgan|first=Tony|publisher=Laurance King|year=2011|isbn=|location=London, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the higher price point and packaging of Ferrero Rocher may communicate sophistication and better quality. Visual appearance can have a significant effect on purchase decision,&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; companies such as Coke a Cola and Pepsi provide a free fridge to distributors to control how products are displayed at the point of purchase.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

==Multiplier effect==
While boarding a [[United Airlines]] flight, Dave Carroll saw baggage handlers on the tarmac damage his [[Taylor Guitars|Taylor]] guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2009/jul/23/youtube-united-breaks-guitars-video|title=Singer gets his revenge on United Airlines and soars to fame|last=Tran|first=Mark|date=2009-07-23|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; After failed attempts to solve the issue through customer service, Carroll uploaded a humorous [[YouTube]] video titled "United breaks guitars",&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; which experienced over 15 million views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=sonsofmaxwell|title=United Breaks Guitars|date=2009-07-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4zOqozo|accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, United faced a drop in the stock market.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Carroll's YouTube video is an example of the '''multiplier effect''', and how consumer experiences are shared through user-generated content (UGC) networks and word of mouth communication.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Research shows customer are more likely to pass on negative experiences, and therefore, such interactive platforms have a significant impact on purchase decisions and brand outlook.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

This highlights a trend in integration of consumer behaviour with marketing communications, where technology has facilitated social group communication. Communication has changed from one direction with companies in control of their message to a dialogue where businesses interact with consumer feedback.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; As Andy Lark, Commonwealth Bank CMO states "the power has shifted, we are now entering a transparent age where there are no secrets".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/marketing-and-advertising-shift-to-where-the-eyeballs-are--online-20120406-1wgz3.html|title=Marketing and advertising shift to where the eyeballs are - online|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional models viewed paid media platforms as the primary source of information. However technology has enabled dialogue within a consumer-centric communication platform.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This flow of information allows a many-to-many exchange through UGC, which includes all types of creative content online through blogs, chats, forums, online platforms for product reviews and social media websites such as [[Facebook]], YouTube and [[Instagram]],&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; which are known as earned and shared media.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==Co-creation==
[[Nike Inc.|Nike]] built an example of co-creation and customer empowerment through earned and shared media. Nike ID is an online application that allows customers to design their shoe and therefore "Just do it online".&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Market-generated media remain an important communication platform and information source.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Consumers tend to consider both market-generated and UGC when making a purchase decision,&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; particularly, for higher involvement product like [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] [[record album]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dhar|first=Vasant|last2=Chang|first2=Elaine A.|date=2009-11-01|title=Does Chatter Matter? The Impact of User-Generated Content on Music Sales|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094996809000723|journal=Journal of Interactive Marketing|volume=23|issue=4|pages=300–307|doi=10.1016/j.intmar.2009.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transition from traditional media to various forms of online and UGC marketing is increasing. Academics recognize that marketing communication is an open system and customers are influenced by multiple communication platforms.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;  Ultimately positive brand encounters manifest brand supporters who contribute to positive earned and shared media, through product recommendations online and offline.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===The internet===
The Internet features both non-personal and personal forms of communication. It has become one of the most dominant sources of information for most consumers. Belch &amp; Belch {{asof|2012|lc=yes}} explained that the internet is mostly a non-personal form of communication as consumers absorb information online with no personal contact between the consumer and the organizations that are providing the information on their websites. However, as the internet develops, it is including personal communication as consumers interact with marketers online as well as communicate and share information with one another through the use of [[social media]].&lt;ref name="belch2012" /&gt;

The Internet allows multimedia documents to be shared among its users. {{asof|2003}} approximately 30 million websites have been registered worldwide and 650 million were connected to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kitchen|first1=Phillip J|last2=Pelsmacker|first2=Patrick De|title=Integrated Marketing Communications: A Primer|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet as a marketing tool can be used to reach and inform customers directly, create brand loyalty, and build relationships. Online advertising includes elements such as: graphic images as website banners, [[pop-up advertisement]]s, [[homepage]] restyling and anchor deals (co-operation between two organizations ).&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"/&gt;

====Interactivity====
Interactivity is a characteristic feature of the Internet that was described in 1996 by John Deighton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deighton|first=J.|last2=Tedlow|first2=R.|date=1996|title=The Future of Interactive Marketing|url=|journal=Harvard Business Review|volume=|pages=151–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that in the then-new Internet business environment, clients rather than the marketers usually start the interaction, by actively looking for the information that they need. Moreover, personal responses of customers will be collected by corporations and their individual demands will be met according to their desires.

On one hand, traditional media are "push" formats where marketers broadcast their messages to customers, but do not allow direct feedback. The interaction between the two parties is few and far between. On the other hand, Internet media have the attribute of "pull" where customers have the freedom to search for whatever they wish. For instance, whenever a consumer types "flower" on [[Google]]'s search engine, an advertisement of a specific flower shop might be placed on the top or bottom of the search result page by the [[AdWords|Google Adword]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|title=An introduction to Google AdWords|date=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFzoM59bIQ8|accessdate=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google]] makes use of the client's search history and location to place an appropriate ad. The traditional one-way "push" communication is supplanted by the more productive two-way "push and pull" interaction.

====Individualisation====
Compared with the traditional media where the same information is received by all consumers, Internet media can send information "tailored" to the need of a specific consumer.This is another advantage of two-way interaction of the Internet media. One of the first and most prominent examples is the personalized service provided by [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] in which consumers are called by their names and "tailored" recommendations are provided according to their previous purchase records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Internet marketing strategy, implementation and practice|last=Chaffey|first=D.|date=2006|publisher=Financial Times Prentice Hall|year=|isbn=|edition=|location=Harlow|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, besides "tailored" individual service, with the accumulation of consumers' information on the Internet, [[Mass customization|mass customisation]] becomes possible in which companies provide "tailored" content to particular segment of consumers with similar interests. [[Douban]] is a Chinese social networking service website which allows its users to rate movies, TV dramas, music and concerts. It rapidly grew to 200 million registered users in 2013 (founded in 2005). In addition, people who like the same TV drama, like ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', or fans of the same movie star, such as [[Tom Cruise]], will group together to discuss and share their feelings. This allows companies to take advantage of mass customisation to sell products or reinforce their [[brand equity]] in suitable target groups. By doing so, the interaction and co-operation of companies and consumers are deepening, widening and multiplying in a variety of ways.

====Industry restructuring====
Restructuring followed by [[disintermediation]] and [[Re-intermediation|reintermediation]] is one of the essential features of the transition from traditional to Internet marketing communications. The Internet may force traditional distributors or retailers out of business simply because Internet transactions are less costly. [[JD.com]] significantly impacted the distribution channels for personal computers in China as of 2009 by allowing consumers to order different parts of the computers, that were then assembled by the online business, leaving tens of thousands of retailers in that field out of their jobs. In 2015, JD.com accounted for 22.9% of the Chinese online shopping's market share.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/323115/market-share-of-b2c-online-retailers-in-china/|title=China: B2C online retailers market share 2015 {{!}} Statistic|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, according to ''[[Financial Times]]'', with the shifting trend of using mobile phones for online purchase in China, the people using cellphones to log on to the Internet outnumbered those using PC,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/e3081bac-6e66-11e4-afe5-00144feabdc0|title=JD.com growth reflects Chinese consumer shift to mobile|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the next wave of restructuring faced by JD.com and its major competitors like [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]]. In 2014, JD.com's orders deriving from mobile phones increased by 543%, compared with the last year's quarter of the same period. Haoyu Shen, the chief executive of the JD.com, ascribed this result to its own company's app rather than the co-operation with [[Tencent|Tecent]], the Chinese second largest online corporation, although it invested in JD.com in March 2014. As an [[E-commerce|ecommerce]] business, JD.com has been constantly facing challenges and opportunities of reintermediation with the rapid shifts of the technology development of the Internet.

===Social media===
Social media's market penetration is rising thanks to services like YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.  Companies are using these external social media platforms to personally engage with existing and future customers, reinforce brand messaging, influence customer opinions, provide targeted offers, and service customers more efficiently..&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/TalkDebbie/building-a-brand-platform|title=Is your brand bland or grand|last=Elliot, D.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Email===
[[Email marketing]] is directly marketing a commercial message to a group of people using [[email]]. In its broadest sense, every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing. It usually involves using email to send ads, request business, or solicit sales or donations, and is meant to build loyalty, trust, or brand awareness. Email marketing can be done to either sold lists or a current customer database. Broadly, the term is usually used to refer to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing the relationship of a merchant with its current or previous customers, to encourage customer loyalty and repeat business, acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately, and adding advertisements to email messages sent by other companies to their customers.

===In-product communication===
Another channel for direct [[digital marketing]] is [[in-product communication]] (or in-product marketing), which delivers marketing content directly to a user's [[internet of things|internet-connected device]] or [[software|software application]]. In-product marketing content is often very similar to that of email marketing campaigns, but the segmentation and delivery is more targeted.  Because email has become a standard tool in the [[digital marketing]] toolkit, the email channel often is overloaded and overused, leading to much lower [[open rate]]s, lower engagement rates, lower [[click-through rate|click-through rates (CTR)]], and lower [[conversion marketing|conversion rates]].  The rise of internet-connected ([[Internet of Things|IOT]]) devices is enabling a growing number of consumer products manufacturers to take advantage of this channel of marketing communications, to supplement other digital marketing channels.

==Direct marketing==
In [[direct marketing]] the producer communicates directly with potential customers, instead of through third party media. Individual customer's responses and transactions are recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCorkell|title=Direct and Database Marketing|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct marketing is a growing form of marketing communication. It is designed to build the relationship between the customer and the brand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tapp|first1=J|title=The strategic value of direct marketing: what are we good at?|journal=Journal of Database Marketing|issue=9|pages=9–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as [[customer relationship management]] (CRM). Organizations  use customer accounts in order to monitor and understand their needs. They manage detailed information about the customer's touch points with the objective to maximize satisfaction and loyalty. The communication can be in person, by telephone, mail, email or website.&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"/&gt; The interaction between the organization  and the customer is usually a two-way communication. Direct marketing relies on CRM databases which contain valuable customer information. Good quality databases can provide a competitive advantage and increase profitability. Treating the customer database as an expense rather than an investment, or not continuously maintaining or updating them can be detrimental.&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cant|first1=M|last2=Strydom|first2=J|last3=Jooste|first3=C|last4=du Plessis|first4=P|title=Marketing Management|date=2006|publisher=Juta &amp; Co Ltd|location=Cape Town, South Africa|page=458|edition=Fifth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct mail===
Direct mail is a letter, card, catalogue, or sample sent through post, email, [[fax]], or courier. This communication is most effective when the recipient has shown interest in or has previously purchased from the organization. Advantages of direct mail are personalisation, careful targeting, creativity and flexibility. Email is low-cost, but can be lost through [[spam (email)|spam]] and junk email filters. Direct mail is dependent on accurate databases.&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"/&gt;

===Telemarketing===
[[Telemarketing]] is marketing communication via telephone. There are two types of telemarketing: outbound and inbound.&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"/&gt; Outbound telemarketing is used by organizations to reach out to potential customers, generate sales, make appointments with salespeople and introduce new products. Inbound telemarketing is where people call the organization to complain or inquire about products. Both outbound and inbound can be used as a customer service strategy to boost sales and receive suggestions for improvement. Advantages of telemarketing include targeted communications, flexible and direct interaction between the organization and the customer, it can be an effective personal selling partner and it is cost effective compared to face-to-face contact. A disadvantage is that call centres are usually used to handle outbound and inbound telemarketing, which need to be implemented, managed and financed.&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"/&gt;

===Mail order===
[[Mail order]] marketing is a catalogue of products that customers can order to receive in the mail. This form of direct marketing dates back over 100 years. Home shopping, online shopping and teleshopping now accompany it. With current technology mail order has improved. Now there can be a larger range in catalogue, delivery is faster, and complaints are dealt with professionally. Mail order exerts less pressure on the customer than telemarketing and sales are easy to manage, however costly infrastructure is required in maintaining the back-end.&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"/&gt;

===Direct-response advertising===
Direct-response advertising is partially direct marketing. It is a message transmitted through traditional communications media that requires the reader, viewer, listener or customer to respond directly to the organization.&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"/&gt; The audience may respond to receive more information or to purchase a product. A common example of direct response advertising is in television "home shopping immediately to receive a particular deal or discount. Disadvantages are that focus can be lost because of the medium of communication and the targeting can be less narrow compared to direct mail. Organizational messages can get cluttered and crowded.&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"/&gt;

====Cellular marketing====
Cellular marketing uses audience's mobile phone and [[short message service|SMS]] to promote a product or brand. Advantages are a high level of flexibility and easy integration through computer systems using the Internet to send mass text messages. This marketing communications platform allows organizations to directly target customers to remind them to renew subscriptions, give exclusive product discounts, or build brand reputation through competitions or sweepstakes. 
The disadvantage is that some customers are charged to receive SMS, so [[opt-in]] permission is required.&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"/&gt;

====CD/DVD technology====
[[CD]] and [[DVD]] discs can be used as part of e-communications. Entire marketing presentations, catalogues, brochures and price lists can be stored on a CD. CDs are small and simple to hand out to target audiences and most modern computers have CD drive readers, however most of the same information can be presented on a website or email.&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"/&gt;

==Integrated marketing communications==
'''Integrated marketing communications''' ('''IMC''') is the use of [[marketing]] strategies to optimise the communication of a consistent message of the company's brands to stakeholders.&lt;ref name=kitchen2015&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kitchen, P., &amp; Burgmann, I.|year=2015|title=Integrated marketing communications: Making it work at a strategic level|journal=Journal of Business Strategy|volume=36|pages=34–39|doi=10.1108/JBS-05-2014-0052}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coupling methods together improves communication as it harnesses the benefits of each channel, which when combined together builds a clearer and vaster impact than if used individually.&lt;ref name=pitta2006&gt;Pitta, D. A., Weisgal, M., &amp; Lynagh, P. (2006). Integrating exhibit marketing into integrated marketing communications. ''Journal of Consumer Marketing'' '', 23'' (3), 156-166.&lt;/ref&gt; IMC requires marketers to identify the boundaries around the promotional mix elements and to consider the effectiveness of the campaign's message.&lt;ref name=dahl2015&gt;Dahl, S., Low, D., &amp; Eagle, L. (2015). Integrating marketing communications and social marketing: Together for a common good? ''Journal of Social Marketing'' '', 5'' (3), 226-240.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid to late 1980s, the marketing environment was undergoing profound environmental changes with implications for marketing communications. Media proliferation, audience fragmentation, globalisation of markets, the advent of new communications technologies, the widespread use of databases meant that the old methods, and practices used in mass marketing were no longer relevant. In particular, the rise of digital and interactive media meant that marketers were relying less on advertising as the dominant form of marketing communications. Amongst practitioners and scholars, there was an increasing recognition that new approaches to marketing communications were required. That new approach would become known as ''integrated marketing communications.''  A number of empirical studies, carried out in the early 1990s, found that the new IMC was far from a "short-lived managerial fad," but rather was a very clear reaction by advertisers and marketers to the changing external environment.

Integrated marketing communications is a holistic planning process that focuses on integrating messages across communications disciplines, creative executions, media, timing and stakeholders. An integrated approach  has emerged as the dominant approach used by companies to plan and execute their marketing communication programs &lt;ref name="cbaweb.sdsu.edu"&gt;Belch, G.E and Belch, M.A., "Evaluating the Effectiveness of Elements of Integrated Marketing Communications: A Review of Research," ''Occasional Paper,'' San Diego State University, 2016 &lt;Online: https://cbaweb.sdsu.edu/assets/files/imc/abstracts/effect-imc.doc&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described as a ''paradigm shift.''&lt;ref&gt;chul, L., Han, D. and Schultz, D., "Understanding the Diffusion of Integrated Marketing Communications," ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' Vol. 44, No. 1, 2004, pp 31-45&lt;/ref&gt;

IMC unifies and coordinates an organization's marketing communications to promote a consistent brand message.&lt;ref&gt;Shimp, T. A. (2010).

===History===
The  impetus to rethink marketing communications came from a number of environmental changes that were becoming increasingly apparent throughout the mid to late 1980s. Media was proliferating and at the same time converging, audiences were fragmenting and many new communications disciplines were emerging. Few advertising agencies provided the full suite of services in terms of the varied communications disciplines. Companies were reliant on a multiplicity of service providers for assistance with advertising, public-relations, branding, packaging, sales promotion, event organisers and other promotional activities. Each of these communications disciplines was treated as a "silo"; with little thought to the synergies between them,with the result that many different stakeholders involved in presenting the company's external image throughout the breadth and length of a campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelissen, J.P., Christensen, L. and Vijn, P., "Understanding the Development and Diffusion of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC): A Metaphorical Perspective, NRG Working Paper No. 06-02, 2006, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; In that environment, both practitioners and theorists recognised the potential for confusing or inconsistent brand images to develop across media and across different communications disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Ang, L., ''Principles of Integrated Marketing Communications: A Focus on New Technologies and Advanced Theories,'' [Kindle Edition], Cambridge University Press, 2014, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;  The fragmentation of audiences presented marketers with particular challenges. No longer were they able to communicate with mass markets via mass media; instead they needed to communicate with increasingly tightly defined market segments, using highly specialist media and communications disciplines. New media and the use of databases were enabling marketers to communicate with customers on a one-to-one basis.&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen, P.J. and Schultz, D.E. "A Multi-Country Comparison of the Drive for IMC." ''Journal of Advertising Research,''1999, p. 21; Tedlow, R.A. and Jones, G., ''The Rise and Fall of Mass Marketing'', Routledge, N.Y., 1993 Ch 2; Kara, A and Kaynak, E., "Markets of a Single Customer: Exploiting Conceptual Developments in Market Segmentation", ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 31, No. 11/12, 1997, pp. 873–895, DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/03090569710190587&lt;/ref&gt; The old methods and practices associated with mass communications were failing to serve the realities of the new era.&lt;ref&gt;Kliatchko, J.G., "Towards a New Definition of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC)," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol 24, No. 1, 2005, pp. 7–34.&lt;/ref&gt; The imperative to present a clear, coherent and unified narrative in both internal and external communications was becoming increasingly apparent by the late 1980s.

In 1989, two discrete events served to draw attention to the fact that industry attitudes to marketing communications were shifting. Firstly, the consulting firm, [[Shearson#Shearson Lehman Hutton|Shearson-Lehman Hutton]] published a report on the subject of consumer advertising, signalling that a number of market-place changes would force packaged goods marketers to adopt a more integrated approach to marketing communications. Their report also noted that high-end manufacturers (e.g. automobiles) and up-market services (e.g. cruise vacations) were more inclined to use integrated promotions.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L.,''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, pp 5-6;  Kliatchko, J.G., "Towards a New Definition of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC)," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol 24, No. 1, 2005, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the [[American Association of Advertising Agencies]] (4A's), instituted a task-force to investigate integrated marketing communications (IMC), with the result that the first official definition was published. The AAAA defined IMC as, "a concept of marketing communications planning that recognizes the added value of a comprehensive plan that evaluates the strategic roles of a variety of communication disciplines (e.g. general advertising, direct response, sales promotion, and public relations) and combines these disciplines to provide clarity, consistency, and maximum communication impact."&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L.,''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, p. 5; Cornelissen, J.P., Christensen, L. and Vijn, P., "Understanding the Development and Diffusion of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC): A Metaphorical Perspective, NRG Working Paper No. 06-02, 2006, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage, the development of IMC, focused primarily on the need for organisations to offer more than just standard [[advertising]] and to integrate the various communications disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Kliatchko, J., "Revisiting the IMC Construct: A Revised Definition and Four Pillars," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No. 1, 2008, pp. 138-139&lt;/ref&gt; The 4As originally coined the term the "new advertising"; however, this title did not appropriately incorporate many other aspects included in the term "IMC" – most notably, those beyond traditional advertising process aside from simply advertising.&lt;ref name="dandc"&gt;{{cite book|first=Duncan |last=Tom |first2=Clarke |last2=Caywood |chapter=The Concept, Process and Evolution of Integrated Marketing Communication |title=Integrated Communication: Synergy of Persuasive Voices |editor-last=Esther |editor-first=Thorson |editor-first2=Jeri |editor-last2=Moore |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1996 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Northwestern Arch.jpg|thumb|The Medill School at Northwestern was the first university to teach course in integrated marketing communications]]

In 1991, the faculty of [[Medill School of Journalism]], [[Northwestern University]] in conjunction with the AAAA, began the first empirical research study designed to investigate how IMC was being used.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, D. and Kitchen, P., "Integrated Marketing Communications in US Advertising Agencies: An Exploratory Study," ''Journal of Adaertising Research,'' Vol. 37, no, 5, 1997, pp.7-17&lt;/ref&gt; The study focused around understanding the concept and the importance of IMC and also to analyse the extent in which IMC was practiced in all major U.S advertising agencies. This initial study was then replicated by other studies with a view to examining how IMC was being used in other countries; New Zealand, UK, US, Australia, India, Thailand, South Africa and the Philippines, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Kliatchko, J.G., "Towards a New Definition of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC)," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol 24, No. 1, 2005, pp. 8-9; Ichul, L., Han, D. and Schultz, D., "Understanding the Diffusion of Integrated Marketing Communications," ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' Vol. 44, No. 1, 2004, pp 31-45&lt;/ref&gt; The findings from these studies demonstrated that the new IMC was far from a "short-lived managerial fad" but rather was "a very clear reaction by advertising agencies and their clients as they are affected by a multitude of factors such as new forms of information technology including development and usage of databases, media fragmentation, client desires for interaction/synergy, and global and regional coordination."&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen, P.J. and Schultz, D.E. "A Multi-Country Comparison of the Drive for IMC." ''Journal of Advertising Research,''Vol. 39, No. 1, 1999, p. 21; Shimp, T.A. ''Advertising Promotion and Other Aspects of Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Cengage, 2008, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; This was the second stage of IMC's development, where the focus shifted to documenting the practice of IMC as a global phenonenon. In other words, researchers were attempting to codify practices that had been used for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Kliatchko, J., "Revisiting the IMC Construct: A Revised Definition and Four Pillars," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No. 1, 2008, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, [[Don E. Schultz|Don Schultz]] and his team published the first text-book dedicated to IMC.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, D. E., Tannenbaum, S.I. and Lauterborn, R.F., ''Integrated Marketing Communications: Putting it together and making it work, '' Lincolnwood, Ill., NTC Business Books, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Their work, simply entitled, ''Integrated Marketing Communications,'' described IMC as a totally new way of looking at the whole of marketing communications, rather than looking at each of the parts separately. And, in the same year, the Medill School at Northwestern University changed their curriculum to include a focus on this new idea of integrated marketing communications rather than the traditional program which had emphasised advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L.,''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, pp 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; IMC emerged from an "academic department that, for several decades, had been recognized as the number one advertising program.&lt;ref&gt;Caywood,C., ''The Handbook of Strategic Public Relations and Integrated Marketing Communications,''Chicago, Ill., McGraw-Hill, 2012;&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1990s, virtually every text-book on the subject of marketing communications has adopted an integrated perspective or has added chapters on IMC in new editions of standard works.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, F., Patti, C. and Ichul, K., "An Inside-out Approach to Integrated Mmarketing Communications: An International Perspective," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No.4, 2008, pp 531-34; Finne, A. and Gronroos, C., "Rethinking Marketing Communications: From Integrated Marketing Communications to Relationship Communicatios," in ''The Evolution of Integrated Marketing Communications: The Customer-driven Marketplace,'' Don Schultz (ed), Routledge, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Collectively these books focus on the IMC planning processes and this represents the third distinct stage in the evolution of IMC – an emphasis on managing and organising IMC.&lt;ref&gt;Kliatchko, J., "Revisiting the IMC Construct: A Revised Definition and Four Pillars," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No. 1, 2008, pp. 140-141&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, scholars have advanced different definitions of IMC, with each definition exhibiting a slightly different emphasis. Yet, in spite of the variety of definitions in circulation, there is general consensus that integrated marketing communications should be viewed as a planning process.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L.,''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have pointed out that because IMC is both a process and a concept, it is exceedingly difficult to define.&lt;ref&gt;Kliatchko, J.G., "Towards a New Definition of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC)," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol 24, No. 1, 2005, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the key definitions that have been advanced during IMC's evolution are outlined here:

* "IMC is the process of all sources and information managed so a consumer or prospect is exposed which behaviorally moves the customer more towards a sale."  (Schultz, 1991)&lt;ref&gt;Don Schultz (1991) quoted in Kliatchko, J.G., "Towards a New Definition of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC)," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol 24, No. 1, 2005, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

* "The strategic co-ordination of all messages and media used by an organisation to influence its perceived brand value." (Duncan and Everett, 1993) &lt;ref&gt;Cited in: Percy, L.,''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, p.7 &lt;/ref&gt;

* "The process of strategically controlling or influencing all messages and encoring purposeful dialogue to created and nourish profitable relationships with consumers and other stakeholders." (Duncan &amp; Caywood, 1996)&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, T. and Caywood, C., "The concept, process, and evolution of integrated marketing communications, in Thorson, E. and Moore, J. (eds), ''Integrated Communication: Synergy of Persuasion Voices, Mahwah, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum, 1996, pp. 13-34&lt;/ref&gt;

* "[A three-pronged definition] One-voice marketing communications is integration that creates a clear and consistent image, position, message, and/or theme across all marketing communication disciplines or tools. Integrated communications refers to the creation of both a brand image and a behavioural response that emanate directly from marketing communications materials such as advertisements. Coordinated marketing communications associates 'integrated' with the concept of 'coordination'.  (Nowak &amp; Phelps, 1994)&lt;ref&gt;Nowak and Phelps (1994)quoted in Kliatchko, J.G., "Towards a New Definition of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC)," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol 24, No. 1, 2005, pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

* "IMC is a strategic business process used to plan, develop, execute and evaluate coordinate measurable persuasive brand communication programs over time with consumers, customers and prospects, and other that are targeted, relevant internal and external audiences." (Schultz &amp; Schultz, 1998)&lt;ref&gt;Schultz &amp; Schultz, 1998 quoted in Kliatchko, J.G., "Towards a New Definition of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC)," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol 24, No. 1, 2005, pp. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

* "IMC is the concept and process of strategically managing audience-focused,channel-centred, and results-driven brand communication programmes over time." (Kliatchko, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Kliatchko, J.G., "Towards a New Definition of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC)," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol 24, No. 1, 2005, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

* "An IMC program plans and executes various marketing activities with consistency so that its total impact exceeds the sum of each activity. It is a strategy in which different communication tools like advertising, public relations, sales promotion, direct marketing and personal selling work together to maximize the communication impact on target consumers." (Saeed et al., 2013)&lt;ref&gt;Saeed, R., Naeem, B., Bilal, M. and Naz, U., "Integrated Marketing Communication: A Review Paper," ''Interdisciplinary Journal of Contemporary Research in Business,'' Vol. 5, No, 5, 2013, pp 124-133&lt;/ref&gt;

* "IMC is the planning and execution of all types of advertising-like and promotion-like messages selected for a brand, service, or company, in order to meet a common set of communication objectives, or more particularly, to support a single ‘ positioning’." (Larry Percy, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L.,''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, there is general agreement amongst both practitioners and scholars that the emergence of IMC represents "a significant example of development in the marketing discipline... [that] has influenced thinking and acting among all types of companies and organizations facing the realities of competition in an open economy."&lt;ref&gt;Holm, O. "Integrated marketing communication: From Tactics to Strategy", ''Corporate Communications: An International Journal,'' Vol. 11, No. 1, 2006, pp.23-33, https://doi.org/10.1108/13563280610643525&lt;/ref&gt; Belch and Belch argue that IMC has become the dominant approach used by companies to plan and execute their marketing communication programs&lt;ref&gt;Belch, G.E and Belch, M.A., "Evaluating the Effectiveness of Elements of Integrated Marketing Communications: A Review of Research," ''Occasional Paper,'' San Diego State University, 2016 &lt;Online: https://cbaweb.sdsu.edu/assets/files/imc/abstracts/effect-imc.doc&gt; p. 2 &lt;Online: cbaweb.sdsu.edu&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while other scholars have described IMC as a ''paradigm shift.''&lt;ref&gt;Ichul, L., Han, D. and Schultz, D., "Understanding the Diffusion of Integrated Marketing Communications," ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' Vol. 44, No. 1, 2004, pp 31-45&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Percy argues that "the planning and execution of ''all'' marketing communication should be ''integrated''".&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L., ''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, p.14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning of integration===
[[File:Imaginative advertising on Brockenhurst Station - geograph.org.uk - 170785.jpg|thumb|Integrating the creative and the media can result in imaginative and powerful messages that grab attention and are noticed]]

Within the literature there is no absolute agreement about the meaning of "integration" in the concept, "integrated marketing communications".  The concept of IMC has evolved during its brief history, and with that different ideas around the meaning of integration have been advanced.&lt;ref&gt;Kliatchko, J., "Revisiting the IMC Construct: A Revised Definition and Four Pillars," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No. 1, 2008, pp. 133–160&lt;/ref&gt; The diverse views surrounding IMC and its meaning can be explained by the early state of theoretical development and research on IMC which gives rise to a mulplicity of different perspectives. As the discipline matures, these different views are expected to converge.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelissen, J.P., Christensen, L. and Vijn, P., "Understanding the Development and Diffusion of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC): A Metaphorical Perspective,'' ''NRG Working Paper'' No. 06-02, 2006, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The marketing and advertising literature identifies many different types of integration:

====Functional integration====
Functional integration refers to the capacity of the different promotional tools to complement each other and deliver a unified, coherent message. Each of the communications disciplines (advertising, PR, personal selling, sales promotion etc.) has its own strengths and weaknesses. For instance, it is generally recognised that straight advertising is very effective at creating [[brand awareness]], but much less effective at converting awareness into actual sales.&lt;ref&gt;O'Guinn, T., Allen,C., and Semenik, R.J., ''Advertising and Integrated Brand Promotion,'' Mason, Ohio, South-Western Cengage, 2009, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; As consumers approach the actual purchase, they may turn to other types of promotion such as [[personal selling]] or direct [[marketing]].  A carefully planned communications program will include a blend of tools in a way that the messages move the customer through the various stages of the [[consumer behaviour|purchase decision]] – from need recognition through to purchase and post-purchase stages. Integrating the communications disciplines addresses the question of how the strengths of one discipline can be used to overcome the weaknesses of a different discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Mudzanani, T., "A Review and Analysis of the Role of Integrated Marketing Communication Message Typology in the Development of Communication Strategies," '' African Journal of Marketing Management'' , Vol. 7, no 8, 2015, pp. 90-97; Ang, L., ''Principles of Integrated Marketing Communications: A Focus on New Technologies and Advanced Theories,'' Cambridge University Press, 2014, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Message integration====
Message integration is also known as ''image integration'' or ''creative integration''. A key task for IMC is ensuring consistency in executions within and across the different types of marketing communications, as well as over time. Everything connected with an IMC campaign should have a similar 'look and feel', irrespective of the medium or tool. Message integration does not imply that messages need to identical. Rather it means that every piece of promotion – from advertising to direct mail to collateral materials to packaging to posters to corporate vehicles to business cards and office stationery – should be immediately recognisable as part of the same livery.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L., ''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, pp 202-205&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearly, media releases which are often part of a PR program are very different to persuasive messages used in advertising.  However, messages should include a similar tone and at least some common elements so that each message looks like it is part of a coherent, integrated campaign. Every execution is part of the brand's identity. Consistent executions facilitate brand awareness. People associate the 'look' of the brand's marketing communication with the brand itself. Consistent executions are more of a 'feeling' that ties everything together; a unique look or feel so that the target audience recognizes a brand's marketing communication even before they see the brand name. The key to consistency is the visual feel. This is because the visual memory for the imagery associated with the brand actually elicits faster brand identification than the brand name itself.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L., ''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, pp 202-205; Mudzanani, T., "A review and analysis of the role of integrated marketing communication message typology in the development of communication strategies," '' African Journal of Marketing Management'' , Vol. 7, no 8, 2015, pp. 90-97&lt;/ref&gt;

====Media integration====
Much IMC planning is concerned with co-ordinating different media channels to optimize the effectiveness of marketing communications programmes. If brand communications "reflect implied brand values and imagery that  are consistent throughout differing media channels, then clearly these  channels act in a mutually reinforcing way with each successive consumer engagement."&lt;ref&gt;Hackley, C., ''Advertising and Promotion,'' Sage, 2005, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Certain messages may not translate into other media. For instance, messages containing 'sex appeals' may work well on TV because movement lends itself to eroticism, but may become "flat" in a static medium such as print. In such cases it is important that the secondary media support the primary media and that messages harmonise.&lt;ref name="Ang, L. 2014"&gt;Ang, L., ''Principles of Integrated Marketing Communications: A Focus on New Technologies and Advanced Theories,'' Cambridge University Press, 2014, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Research studies suggest that consumers learn more quickly when exposed to messages via different media. The explanation for this is that slight variations in execution create a slight mental perturbation which grabs attention, and results in more elaborate encoding of the main message argument. By exposing consumers to the same message through multiple media, there are more opportunities to engage with consumers. In short, a multi media strategy is more effective.&lt;ref name="Ang, L. 2014"/&gt;

====Integration of timing====
Integration of timing refers to the timing messages so that they operate to support each other and reach potential customers at different junctures, depending on when they are most receptive to different types of message or depending on the consumer's readiness to buy.&lt;ref name="Ang, L. 2014"/&gt;

====Other types of integration====
Other types of integration include:&lt;ref&gt;Mudzanani, T., "A review and analysis of the role of integrated marketing communication message typology in the development of communication strategies," '' African Journal of Marketing Management'' , Vol. 7, no 8, 2015, pp. 90-97&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Coordinated integration''' refers to the ways that different internal and external agencies (e.g web designers, advertising agencies, PR consultants, graphic designers) coordinate to provide a consistent message.  
:'''Stakeholder integration''' refers to the way that all stakeholders (e.g. employees, suppliers, customers and others) cooperate to communicate a shared understanding of the company's key messages and values. 
:'''Relationship integration''' refers to the way that communications professionals (e.g. marketing managers, advertising managers) contribute to the company's overall corporate goals and quality management.

===Criticisms===
Both practitioners and scholars agree that IMC makes practical "good sense".&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew, L.S., "If IMC is so Good, Why Isn't Being Implemented: Barriers to IMC Adoption in Corporate America," ''Journal of Integrated Communication,'' 2000-2001, pp 29-37; Cornelissen, J.P., Christensen, L. and Vijn, P., "Understanding the Development and Diffusion of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC): A Metaphorical Perspective,'' ''NRG Working Paper'' No. 06-02, 2006, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the discipline has relatively few critics. Nevertheless, researchers have pointed to areas that are in need of further research, and highlight some of the discipline's deficiencies:

*Some practitioners and scholars argue that IMC is not new. Skeptics point out that the more experienced commmunicationsd managers, especially national brand managers, have always practised integration.&lt;ref&gt;Shimp, T.A. ''Advertising Promotion and Other Aspects of Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Cengage, 2008, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

*A more serious criticism of IMC concerns the problem of measurement. The value of IMC activities has proved very difficult to measure due to the interactions of different communications tools.&lt;ref name="cbaweb.sdsu.edu"/&gt;  A growing number of scholars agree that the lack of rigorous measurement metrics and methods represents a major challenge for the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Ewing, M.T. "Integrated Marketing Communications Measurement and Evaluation," ''Journal of Marketing Communications,'' Vol.15, No. 2-3, 2009, pp 103-117&lt;/ref&gt;

*Studies have shown that, while managers are familiar with the IMC concept in theory, it is not widely practiced.  Such findings suggest that IMC is easy to understand, but difficult to do. One possible explanation for the slow uptake is that organisational barriers to implementation may have become entrenched and are difficult to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew, L.S., "If IMC is so Good, Why Isn't Being Implemented: Barriers to IMC Adoption in Corporate America," ''Journal of Integrated Communication,'' 2000-2001, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; A number of organisational characteristics have been cited as possible barriers to implementation. These factors include: a mind-set that has been built up over the years which promotes specialisation rather than integration; organisational structure which has been designed to manage specialisms (e.g. advertising, PR as separate branches); manager ability and lack of skills in integration; agency remuneration systems and the adequacy of budgets.&lt;ref&gt;Pickton,A. and Broderick, D., ''Integrated Marketing Communications,'' 2nd ed., Pearson, Essex, England, 2005, pp 35-39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing communications framework===
The '''marketing communications planning framework''' ('''MCPF''') is a model for the creation of an ICM [[communication planning|plan]]. Created by Chris Fill,&lt;ref&gt;Fill, C. (2013) Marketing Communications, 6th edn, Harlow: Pearsons.&lt;/ref&gt; senior examiner for the [[Chartered Institute of Marketing]], the MCPF is intended to solve the inadequacies of other frameworks.

=== Integrated Marketing Communications planning approaches===
====Inside–out approach====
An  “inside-out”  approach is the traditional planning approach to marketing  communication. Planning begins "inside" the organisation by identifying the goals and objectives which are often based around what has always been done. Communication's task then becomes a process of "selling" the organisation's message to the "outside" or external stakeholders. .&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, F., Patti, C. and Ichul, K., "An Inside-out Approach to Integrated Marketing Communications: An International Perspective," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No.4, 2008, pp 531-540&lt;/ref&gt;

The inside–out approach to integrated marketing communications has been criticised as a one sided view point, since it combines the elements of communication and marketing to create a single unified message. Porcu and his team point out that many of the first, tentative attempts to practice IMC were primarily concerned with integrating the message, so that to organisation appeared to speak with "one voice,"  but failed to adopt a more rounded customer orientation. The inside–out approach is weak due to the stagnant, outdated method.&lt;ref name="Porcu, L. 2012, pp 313-348"&gt;Porcu, L., del Barrio-Garcia, S., and Kitchen, P.J., "How Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) works? A theoretical review and an analysis of its main drivers and effects/ ¿Cómo funciona la Comunicación Integrada de Marketing (CIM)? Una revisión teórica y un análisis de sus antecedentes y efectos," ''COMUNICACIÓN Y SOCIEDAD,'' Vol. XXV, Núm. 1, 2012, pp 313-348&lt;/ref&gt;

====Outside–in approach====
The outside–in approach of integrated marketing communications seeks to understand the needs and wants of the consumer.&lt;ref name="Porcu, L. 2012, pp 313-348"/&gt; In addition to the previous category, this approach establishes significant progression. Organisations can gain in-depth knowledge based on consumers and therefore can accommodate the way they approach to fulfil their requirements. Relationship marketing aids in building up a history of frequent conversation between organisations and stakeholders which contributes to trust.&lt;ref&gt;Gambetti, R. C. and Schultz, D. E., "Reshaping the Boundaries of Marketing Communication to Bond with Consumers," ''Journal of Marketing Communications,'' Vol 21, No. 1, 2015 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Communication builds rapport that could prove to be profitable as they retain clientele. The outside-in approach offers a unique way to planning, as it operates backwards by concentrating on customers first, then determining the most effective course of marketing and communication methods to implement. Effectively managing the strategic business process is crucial as it defines the steps to follow which ensure brand value is upheld.

====Cross-functional planning approach====
Cross-functional planning approach of integrated marketing communications diverges away from the other two categories, it does not centre around the concept of marketing promotional elements, instead the focus has shifted toward restructuring the organisation to increase a customer-centric environment. This approach recognises that messages do not just come from the marketing department, but can come from virtually any department within the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Porcu, L., del Barrio-Garcia, S., and Kitchen, P.J., "How Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) works? A theoretical review and an analysis of its main drivers and effects," ''COMUNICACIÓN Y SOCIEDAD,'' Vol. XXV, Núm. 1, 2012, especially see pp 323-325&lt;/ref&gt; Investing for the reorganisation sparks change where all departments interconnect to work cohesively toward managing and planning all stages of brand relationship. As a unified organisation, the cross-functional process is a competitive advantage as they can achieve profitable relationships with customers and stakeholders. This can be achieved through improving the relation amongst messages sent from all departments through channels to the receivers. By sending strategic messages and monitoring any external reaction, organisations gain feedback data from consumers which can be used to inform subsequent planning or fine-tuning of the communications strategy. The process is circular, not linear,&lt;ref&gt;Porcu, L., del Barrio-Garcia, S., and Kitchen, P.J., "How Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) works? A theoretical review and an analysis of its main drivers and effects," ''COMUNICACIÓN Y SOCIEDAD,'' Vol. XXV, Núm. 1, 2012, p. 323-325&lt;/ref&gt; at the beginning organisation and consumer communicate by interacting and dialogue which ignites the relationship, over time trust is earned and the consumer may continue to purchase, which in turn increases sales and profitability for the organisation and finally, the relationship is strong and the organisation retains clientele.&lt;ref name=dahl2015/&gt; Interactive communication is advantageous for a cross-functional approach as the business and consumer are both involved in brand communication.&lt;ref name=Valos16&gt;Valos, M. J., Habibi, F. H., Casidy, R., Driesener, C. B. and Maplestone, V. L., "Exploring the Integration of Social Media within Integrated Marketing Communication Frameworks: Perspectives of Services Marketers," ''Journal of Marketing Practice,'' Vol. 34, no. 1, pp 19-40.&lt;/ref&gt; Implementing IMC is a flexible process due to the changing nature of the marketing dynamics therefore by eliminating borders within the organisation it allows for this notion.

===Barriers to implementation===
The barriers to implementation have been cited as one of the main reasons for the failure to adopt holistic approaches to IMC.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, F., Patti, C. and Ichul, K., "An Inside-out Approach to Integrated Mmarketing Communications: An International Perspective," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No.4, 2008, pp 531-34&lt;/ref&gt; The key barriers cited in the literature are:

'''No support from senior management'''

It is vital for an organisation who implements integrated marketing communications to have the commitment from all levels of employees, including senior management.&lt;ref name=kitchen2015/&gt; The union between both marketing and corporate goals should coincide and support simultaneously. The lack of involvement from senior management could lead to IMC being deprived of resources which prevents the full potential IMC can deliver for the organisation to benefit from.&lt;ref name=Valos16/&gt; Higher levels of the business need to coincide with the efforts of staff in the strategic planning to grasp that IMC's programme is valuable.

'''Clients are confused about the concept'''

Some companies such as advertising agencies could possibly take advantage of the integrated marketing communications model, due to the stress they receive from clients and budgets being reduced.&lt;ref name=kitchen2015/&gt; The introduction of new technology broadens the boundaries for advertising elements to endeavour with such avenues like the internet. Their focus may stray from the core principles of IMC which is to integrate the elements together, as they're less effective individually.  Also, their clients may not grasp the IMC concept as an essential attribute, therefore, they perceive IMC as saving money due to the strategic juxtaposition.

'''Organisation is too specialised'''

One of the core fundamentals of integrated marketing communications is that of the focus aspires toward a customer orientation.&lt;ref name=kitchen2015/&gt; In spite of that, the purpose of some organisations have not adopted the framework and are still task orientated. Examples include public relations, direct marketing and advertising.

'''Conflict within organisation'''

Trying to implement integrated marketing communications into strong hierarchy structured organisations may cause staff resistance due to the nature of horizontal communication causing disagreements amongst staff.&lt;ref name=kitchen2015/&gt; Staff may not perform their tasks and functions which jeopardises the work environment. For IMC to be successful the culture of the organisation needs to accommodate an open perspective where communication amongst the varying departments are managed tactically.&lt;ref name=likethis&gt;Valos, M. J., Habibi, F. H., Casidy, R., Driesener, C. B., &amp; Maplestone, V. L. (2016). Exploring the integration of social media within integrated marketing communication frameworks: Perspectives of services marketers. Journal of Marketing Practice , 34 (1), 19-40&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals reactions toward the new restructure will differ,  as some become custom to the process and enjoy the borderless integration, on the other hand, some may feel threatened from the absence of control that once maintained order and power within the previous structured organisation (Vladmir, Miroslav, &amp; Papic, 2012). A corporate structure may not necessarily invite IMC due to their culture being incompatible for the integration.

====Removing barriers====
Integrated marketing communication is the process of communicating an idea in order to attract customers using an array of tools. It is the process of sending out a message to a receiver (Communications, 2016). Depending on the company values and the type of product or service they offer, the most appropriate message to deliver will depend on the brand and consumer. To understand how integrated marketing communication can benefit a business, three main areas will be discussed. These areas being who the Sender is? Who is the Receiver? And what tools can the sender use in order to pass a message on to the receiver?

Practical solutions towards improving marketing strategies by using ICM can be done through two differing marketing concepts the [[four P's]] or the [[four C's]] . Also, the uses of encoding and decoding should be followed, all of which intertwine to form growth in sales financially for a business.

A sender is someone who is aiming to communicate an idea to a receiver, which might be an individual or a group. Marketers must first understand who the receive is in order to successfully implement marketing communications. For example, [[Staples Inc.|Staples]] seeks to identify itself as a 'one-stop' shop for all office needs. It advertises a wide variety of office supplies, safe and on time delivery, competitive pricing and excellent customer service. Staples focuses its marketing efforts on advertising those values.  Their slogan "To make more happen, everyday". This theme is the most appropriate because it attracts their target audience. Workers have little time on their hands, the product they offer will give them the ability to make life easier; by doing so, they save time. In today's fast-paced lifestyle, if a service is convenient, customers will most likely use the product. Staples have successfully taken the necessary steps in order to communicate their values to their customers. They have done this through understanding who they are and who they should be targeting.

==4C's==
Originally, marketing was focused around the [[4P's]] (product, price, place and promotion) which concentrated on companies' internal concepts. The idea of integrated marketing communications was first raised in 1993 by [[Don E. Schultz]], who changed the 4P's concept into the 4C's model. The four parts include consumer, communication, convenience and cost, taking into consideration the needs and wants of consumers. Integrated marketing communications accomplished synergy when each element was executed in accordance with the overall vision of the organisation's campaign, which allows the message to be executed efficiently.&lt;ref name=dahl2015/&gt; Finding out who the target market is to answer the 4C's: knowing what products they're willing to purchase, the amount of money they are willing to spend for it, how the product will fulfil their needs and wants, the accessibility of the product and how easily correct information is transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;Nagra, G. K., Kumari, S., Gopal, R., &amp; Manjrekar, P. (2012). Impact of Integrated Marketing Communication on different customer segments, effects on consumer decision making process. ''International Journal of Applied Services Marketing Perspectives'' '', 1'' (1), 56-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Changing the emphasis onto what consumers desire leads to a higher success being attained through IMC, as it is being influenced by not only internal stakeholders but also external ones.

==Communication-based relationship marketing==
Expanding from this, Tom Duncan and Sandra E. Moriarty formed the concept of communication-based relationship marketing. This model diverged from the concept of the general one way, business influencing consumers what to believe scenario.&lt;ref&gt;Lucia, P., del Barrio-Garcia, S., &amp; Kitchen, P. J. (2012). How Integrated Marketing Communications works? A theoretical review and analysis of its main drivers and effects. ''Journal of Marketing Communications'' '', 25'' (1), 313-348. &lt;/ref&gt; However, Duncan and Moriarty argued that communication between business and consumers was the key to developing strong establishment for consumer orientated marketing endeavours. The process of IMC through communication-based marketing goes through a sequential three stage process. Organisations begin with choosing an effective mixture of communication methods; then, the marketing methods are selected; thereafter, the best of each element is fused and integrated together which thence is channelled from the organisation to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Vladmir, M., Miroslav, K., &amp; Papic, T. (2012). The necessity to adjust traditional integrated marketing communications tools and techniques to new global trends. ''Journal of Marketing Communications'' '', 61'' (4), 141-154.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, these findings shaped modern marketing, focusing on an interactive two-way approach that builds rapport with stakeholders. Developments from integrated marketing communications have evolved into three categories: inside-out approach, outside-in approach and cross-functional strategic approach.

==Branding==
{{main|Brand management}}
Branding goes beyond having a logo; it is how businesses communicate on behalf of their company, verbally and visually. A brand is a conversation {{em dash}} it is how people talk about your company when you are not in the room.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Consumers are constantly interacting and meeting with brands. This can be through television or other media advertisements such as event sponsorships, personal selling and product packaging. Brand exposure such as this is known as a brand touch point or brand contact whereby the organization  can try impressing its consumer. Without branding, consumers wouldn't be able to decipher between products and decide which one they like most. People may not be able to even tell the differences between some of the brands, they would have to try each brand several times before being able to judge which one was best. In order to help with purchase decisions, marketing communications try to create a distinct image for the brand. Brand associations are made to encourage linkages with places, personalities or even emotions which creates a sophisticated brand personality in the minds of the consumers. This shows how brand communications add value to products&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and why branding is a crucial aspect to the communication platform.

==Focus==
Marketing communications are focused on the product/service as opposed to corporate communications where the focus of communications work is the company/enterprise itself. Marketing communications are primarily concerned with demand generation and product/service positioning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://inevitablesteps.com/marketing/marketing-communication-mix/ |title=Marketing Communication Mix: Promote Effectively |date=June 12, 2015 |publisher=Inevitable Steps |accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while corporate communications deal with issue management, mergers and acquisitions, litigation, etc.

==Customer-focused versus customer-centric==
A recent revelation in integrated marketing communication is the change in the role of the customer within the business world. Due to the fast-paced growth of technology, customers are rapidly gaining more power through forums such as word of mouth; now with capabilities of reaching a much wider audience through the use of social media. Recognizing this power shift, organizations have begun to re-evaluate their typical marketing strategies and customer approaches from the traditional customer-focused attitude to the wide-spreading customer-centric method in order to develop a more integrated strategy.

A customer-focused approach can be defined as "when an organization learns more about the habits of the customer so that they can identify opportunities for [[cross-selling]] etc" (Laurie &amp; Mortimer, 2011). While this type of approach can be viewed as entirely satisfactory, Kliatchko (2008) introduced a contrasting concept which concentrates on "working from the outside in" and promotes a different perspective on organizations. When an organization adopts a customer-centric technique, they forgo the view that customers are only passive receivers of marketing techniques and focus on listening to what their needs are and striving to satisfy them; integrating the customer into the process (Laurie &amp; Mortimer, 2011). Many organizations are yet to relinquish such control, as shown by research conducted by ''Campaign'' magazine, which can only be suspected to be due to the fear that it could potentially diminish the marketing profession (Laurie &amp; Mortimer, 2011). This view, however, is rebutted by Saihtiri et al. (2014) who claims that "achieving superiority in customer-centric performance is then rewarded through stronger brand performance in the marketplace".

==Early life==
Born to an [[Indian Air Force]] officer, he accompanied his parents with their postings at various Indian cities. As a consequence his education was cross cultural and spread across various regions in India and the schools he studied in include Frank Anthony School in [[Agra]], Bishops School in [[Pune]], Jesus and Mary School in [[Amritsar]] before completing his high schooling from [[The Air Force School (Subroto Park)|The Air Force School]] in [[New Delhi]]. He subsequently completed his professional education from [[Lal Bahadur Shastri College of Advanced Maritime Studies and Research|LBS College of Advanced Maritime Studies and Research]] as a certified Master Mariner, having earlier completed his professional training at the [[Training Ship Rajendra|TS Rajendra]].

==Career==
In 1982 Kohli commenced his career as a [[merchant mariner|mariner]] and was later master of oceangoing ships for the final 15 years. Amongst others, he was the [[Master mariner|master]] and [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] of one of the world's largest refrigerated cross-ocean carriers ([[reefer ship]]s). Besides refrigerated transportation, he also directed or operated [[car carrier]]s, [[oil tankers]], [[container ships]], ice-class [[General cargo ship|general cargo]]carriers, timber carriers and others.

Between 2008 and 2012 Capt. Kohli contributed through professional executive roles as the prime mover in one of the largest logistics and distribution companies in India and later for the integration of the largest logistics &amp; supply chain infrastructure enterprises, heading the development of solutions to drive a pan-national footprint of India's first set of [[Free trade zone|Free Trade Zones]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Eminent persons from private industry in Indian Government.jpg|thumb|List of Eminent people in government service, article in Business Standard Newspaper, 16 July 2013]] --&gt;
In 2012 he was selected to help the Government of India incubate the [[National Centre for Cold-chain Development]] (NCCD) as their founding Chief Advisor. At NCCD, Kohli was closely involved in establishing a historic MoU of cooperation in cold chain between nodal Indian and French organisations and represented India as guest of honor at the International Conference on sustainable cold chain in Paris (April 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubifrance.com/in/Posts-7047-An-Indo-French-agreement-to-reinforce-cooperation-in-the-cold-chain-expertise|title=An Indo-French agreement to reinforce cooperation in the cold chain expertise}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prlog.org/12108276-india-is-guest-of-honor-at-international-cold-chain-conference-in-paris.html|title=India is Guest of Honor at International Cold chain Conference in Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015 he was invited as a global expert to speak on the Global Food Crisis at the [[House of Lords]] in UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ranisingh/2015/08/12/without-cooling-most-modern-society-would-crumble-says-cold-chain-expert-pawanexh-kohli|title=Without Cooling, Most Modern Society Would Crumble}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dearman.co.uk/#!Sustainably-Meeting-the-Global-Food-Crisis/ccrp/558a742d0cf20d45521c45c1|title=Sustainably Meeting the Global Food Crisis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pittsburgh Life Sciences Greenhouse''' (PLSG) is an investment firm based in the South Side neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] that provides resources and tools to entrepreneurial [[life sciences]] enterprises in Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania in order to advance research and patient care.

Since PLSG began operations in 2002, it has assisted more than 435 life sciences companies and has affected more than 10,000 jobs in western Pennsylvania. PLSG has provided 34 companies with office or laboratory space, and 14 have been relocated to Pittsburgh from outside the region. PLSG has invested over $20 million in 77 companies, which has leveraged over $1.5 billion in additional capital to the region.

PLSG guides researchers, entrepreneurs and emerging companies through the challenges faced in early stages of company development. They provide support to companies developing product and service innovations in biotechnology tools, diagnostics/screening, healthcare IT, medical devices and therapeutics. PLSG also helps in the expansion of more mature life science companies, by supporting new product and market developments and connecting them to investors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.plsg.com/about/|title=Pittsburgh Life Sciences Greenhouse (PLSG) invests in and provides customized support to entrepreneurial life sciences enterprises in western Pennsylvania|website=www.plsg.com|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pittsburgh Life Sciences Greenhouse grew out of an original plan known as BioVenture, developed by CMU and Pitt.&lt;ref name="cmu.edu"&gt;[http://www.cmu.edu/cmnews/020411/020411_greenhouse.html Greenhouse Attracts First Company; Gets $33.3 Million in State Funding&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The initiative received a major boost in 2001 when money from the state's settlement with the [[tobacco industry]] was pledged to create a life science greenhouse in [[Western Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="lsgpa"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lsgpa.com/index.cfm?act=aboutus| year=2006| title=About the LSGPA| first=| last=Life Sciences Greenhouse of Central PA| publisher=lsgpa.com/| accessdate=2007-01-02| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118102655/http://lsgpa.com/index.cfm?act=aboutus| archivedate=2007-01-18| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Pittsburgh Biomedical Corporation, a non-profit established in 1988 by the Pittsburgh Technology Council, consolidated with PLSG.&lt;ref name="merger"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.plsg.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=146| year=2003| title=PBDC merges with PLSG|first=| last=Pittsburgh Life Sciences Greenhouse| publisher=pittsburghlifesciences.com/| accessdate=2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, PLSG exists as a partnership between the [[Pennsylvania|Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]], [[University of Pittsburgh]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] and the regional foundation of community.  Their state mission is to "create, nurture and help establish a globally dominant life sciences industry in western Pennsylvania." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5966">[[Antitrust]] issues in [[Law of Russia|Russia]] are regulated by one law: Federal Law No. 135-FZ, “On the Protection of Competition", which entered into force on 26 October 2006.&lt;ref name=ppt&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.whitecase.com/spotlight-on-moscow-recent-developments-in-russian-competition-law-04-26-2012/#.UUfc1Vtnoho |title=Spotlight on Moscow: Recent Developments in Russian Competition Law |first=Grigory |last=Chernyshov|date=26 April 2012 |conference=Spotlight on Moscow: Recent developments in Russian Competition Law |conferenceurl= |publisher= [[White &amp; Case]] Moscow|location= |pages= |accessdate= |page= |at= |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The “3rd antimonopoly package”, which entered into force in January 2012, is indicative of a general trend of [[liberalization]] of antimonopoly regulation.&lt;ref name=ppt /&gt; Indeed, its stated aim was to bring Russia more in line with [[European Union competition law|European competition]] regulations.

==History==
Russian competition law was ratified by the [[Supreme Soviet]] of the [[USSR]] in March 1991. In the final stages of [[glasnost]] and the deteriorating tethering of the [[USSR]], the various member soviet republics saw the need for regulation and stabilisation of trade. The representatives to the [[Supreme Soviet]] of the [[USSR]] ratified the Law on Competition and Limitation of Monopolistic Activity in Goods Market in March 1991 which became anti-monopoly policies within Russia after secession from the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| title =  Legislating Competition in the Russian Federation: A New Challenge for Antitrust Policy
| publisher = Antitrust Bulletin| volume = December 22, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Law on the Protection of Competition of 2006 is legislation pursued to translate those policies back into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| url = http://www.conseco.ru/eng/abc/anti-monopoly.html| title =  Anti-Monopoly Regulation| publisher = Conseco Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| url = http://www.usrccne.org/news2.phtml?m=278| title =  Russia's New Anti-Monopoly Law: A Brief Review| year = 2006| publisher = Russia/Eurasia Executive Guide| author = Brian L. Zimbler and Kirill Okorochenkov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal Law No. 135-FZ==
Federal Law No. 135-FZ, “On the Protection of Competition", was legislated on July 26, 2006, and entered into force on October 26, 2006.

===Federal Antimonopoly Service ===
The law was "initiated and developed" by the [[Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia]] (FAS) ({{lang-ru|Федеральная антимонопольная служба России, ФАС России}}), the federal-level [[executive (government)|executive]] governmental organ that controls the execution of antitrust and competition. Headed by [[Igor Artemyev]], it had been established by the [[Ukase|Decree]] of [[President of Russia]] №314 on March 9, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.fas.gov.ru/ Federal Antimonopoly Service website (English)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The law also gives the FAS authority over approval of company mergers stipulating various combinations of thresholds of assets of merging companies, an excess of which would require prior approval from the FAS. The scope of regulation of the FAS is focused on the commodity market and financial services with mandates over operations and transactions not just within the Russian Federation but also those taking place outside the boundaries of Russia which would have anti-competitive effects on the Russian market place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| url = http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=32690
| title =  Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service is at Law with Microsoft| year = 2009| publisher = PanARMENIAN}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the trend in the [[United States v. Microsoft|United States]] and the [[European Union Microsoft competition case|European Union]], the FAS has also taken [[Microsoft litigation|Microsoft]] to task for anti-competitive behaviour by bringing Microsoft to court on 4 June 2009.

===Dominance===
Beyond western European competition laws against dominance, the Competition Law in Russia expressly presumes the existence of dominance by defining thresholds.
* A company is "presumed dominant" if it has more than 50% of [[market share]]
* Dominance must be established by FAS if a company has more than 35% of market share&lt;ref name=ppt /&gt;
* A company with less than 35% of market share is generally not considered dominant unless FAS establishes a case for dominance based on factors like analyses of competition on the market and stability of market share
* '''Collective dominance''' exists if the market share of each entity exceeds 8% ''and'' the aggregate market share:&lt;ref name=ppt /&gt;
**Exceeds 50% for not more than 3 entities
**Exceeds 75% for not more than 5 entities
* A safe harbour [[Margin (finance)|margin]] of up to 20% market share per company for agreements between companies of different segments of a [[supply chain]]

===Other provisions===
The law also places restrictions on aids from, and [[public procurement]] policies of, federal, provincial, or municipal governments that otherwise would encourage anti-competition.

In addition to a distinct competition law, the Code of Administrative Offences has also been amended to increase liability of anti-competitive practices. Punitive measures against anti-competitive practices are meted out in terms of percentages of revenues of a company. Company directors can be criminally liable in cases of a repeated abuse—e.g.,&amp;nbsp;establishing high monopoly or low monopoly prices, unjustified evasion from the execution of contracts with individual customers, creation of obstacles for other entities entering the market—and can be sentenced to up to 7 years in prison.&lt;ref name=ppt /&gt;

==Background and family==
Alexander, known as ''Der Gescheite'' (The Smart One), was born in Zagreb to a Jewish family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ognjen Kraus|1998|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Jonas Alexander, was a merchant who came to Zagreb from [[Güssing]], [[Austria]] and his mother Roza ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Stern) was from an old influential Jewish family from Zagreb. Alexander's father was councillor at the "Croatian commercial artisan chamber".&lt;ref name="gs"&gt;{{harvtxt|Gavro Schwarz|1939|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander had a younger brother, [[Šandor Alexander|Šandor]], and two sisters, Gizela and Ilka. He attended elementary and high school in Zagreb, and a business academy in [[Vienna]]. Around 1860 his father opened a grain store in Zagreb. After his education, Alexander returned to Zagreb and started to work with his father. In 1880 he moved to Sisak where he opened another grain store for his family business. There he was introduced to his future wife, Emma ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Neumann), the daughter of [[Varaždin]] businessman Wolf Neumann. With his wife Alexander had three daughters, Vera (died as a child), Gizela and Mira, and four sons, Ivo, Božidar, Branko and Dragutin. All his children were born in Sisak.&lt;ref name="gs"/&gt; Alexander was active member of the Israelites of Zagreb community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Imenik|1911|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1885 he was the president of the choral society "Danica". In 1915 he moved back to Zagreb with his family.&lt;ref name="gs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="obitelj"/&gt; Alexander was member of the society "Narodni rad - društvo židovskih asimilanata i anticionista u Hrvatskoj" (''Peoples work - Society of Jewish assimilates and anti Zionists in Croatia'').&lt;ref name="žuz"/&gt;

However, Memon was never formally charged.

==Disappearance and involvement==
During the investigation of the kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl's in January 2002, the police were looking for Memon, an industrialist who reportedly owned the shed where Pearl's remains were found, by January 2003. Memon was named by several arrested members of Harakat ul-Mujahedeen Al-Almi as their chief financial backer and was believed to have fled Pakistan. Memon was reported as being still at large.&lt;ref name=CbsNews20031022&gt;

In April 2005 it was reported that Memon was one of the trustees of Al-Akhtar Trust International, a charity, the [[United States Treasury]] asserted, had tied to [[al Qaeda]] and the [[Taliban]].&lt;ref name=DailyTimes20050419&gt;

According to their confessional statements in 2005, the detained militants revealed that three men including senior Al-Qaeda member [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] (now in custody in the US), Abdul Rahman and Nasrullah – both Kuwaiti nationals fluent in [[Arabic]], [[Balochi language|Balochi]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] – arrived at the scene at the behest of Saud Memon, who was believed to be Al-Qaeda's chief financier in Pakistan, and who owned the house, where Pearl was held and took over the operation.

According to the ''[[Associated Press]]'' Memon disappeared four years ago in 2003, and was held in "mysterious detention" and released on 28 April 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jang.com.pk/thenews/may2007-weekly/nos-27-05-2007/dia.htm#5 The missing conscience]&lt;/ref&gt; when he was dumped on a garbage heap in front of his home in [[Karachi]] in very poor health and near death&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlinenews.com.pk/details.php?id=112374 Saud Memon dies in Karachi]&lt;/ref&gt; by unidentified men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/americas/6671067.stm 'Daniel Pearl detainee' is dead]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_10-5-2004_pg7_36 Daniel Pearl ‘refused to be sedated before his throat was cut’]&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of [[Bernard-Henri Lévy]]'s book ''Who killed Daniel Pearl?'', published in the ''[[Asia Times]]'' on 28 June 2003 said:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/EF28Df02.html Book Review: Who killed Daniel Pearl? ]&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|An informant tells [[Bernard-Henri Lévy|BHL]] "how everything started by the dismantling ... of a cell making fake papers for al-Qaeda clandestines"; and how the investigation led to "a trafficker specialized not only in fake papers but in the export of clandestine workers to Riyadh, 11 or 12-year-old kids selected in Karachi and Dacca to work as jockeys in camel races on the beaches of Dubai and, last but not least, al-Qaeda combatants exported, through the Oman Straits, to the Emirates, Yemen and other Middle East countries". This man, the real target of the anti-terrorist operation of September 11, 2002, was not Ramzi bin al-Shibh (who was arrested) or alleged September mastermind Khalid Shaikh (who was not there), but Saud Memon, the owner of the lot, where Pearl was kept captive, tortured, executed and buried.}}

Mr. Mansfield of the [[CIA]] declined to comment on Memon's case, saying, "The C.I.A. does not, as a rule, comment on allegations regarding who has, or has not, been in its custody."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Five days after he was freed, Memon appeared in a wheelchair before the [[Supreme Court in Islamabad]]. Reporters in court said he appeared to be in very poor physical condition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=61893 Owner of shed where Daniel Pearl was slain dies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistani police officials said they wanted to question Memon, but no charges had been laid against him.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Human rights groups have said they suspect that Memon and several others were held in secret [[extrajudicial detention]] by Pakistani intelligence agents probing Pearl's slaying.&lt;ref name=SanDiegoUnionTribune20070518/&gt;
In December 2014, when the [[United States Senate]] [[United States Senate Intelligence Committee|Intelligence Committee]] published its [[Senate report of the CIA's use of torture]], it confirmed suspicions that Memon was held in the CIA's network of [[black sites]], prior to transfer to Pakistan's secret torture prisons.&lt;ref name=News24SA2014-12-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=Enca2014-12-30/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheBureauInvestigates2015-01-15/&gt;&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost2014-12-09/&gt;

[[Amina Masood Janjua]], Memon's lawyer and a human rights activist for missing Pakistanis, said, Memon was in the custody of Pakistani intelligence officials. A senior police official named Manzoor Mughal, investigating Pearl's murder, denied knowing that Memon had ever been in Pakistani custody.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karachipage.com/news/May_07/051907.html Owner of shed where Pearl was slain dies]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Asra Q. Nomani]], a longtime colleague of Daniel Pearl's, Pakistani papers reported that Saud Memon had been held in the United States [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]s, in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost20070624&gt;

Theodore Garbade played a significant role in the settlement between Cuba and the [[United States]] after, [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] succeeded 1913 in passing the [[Revenue Act of 1913|Revenue Act,]] also known as the Tariff Act, or the Underwood Act. The Act established the lowest rates since the [[Walker Tariff]] of 1857. Most schedules were ''ad valorem'' basis, a percentage of the value of the item. This had a profound impact for the Cuban [[Tobacco industry|Tobacco Industry]] concerning their import to the States. As President of the Union of Manufacturers of Cigars of [[Cuba]] Garbade, aided by an appointed committee, laid this out to Cuban ´s President [[Mario García Menocal]] in January 1914, insisting upon an allowance of 50 per cent on their exports of cigars as an equivalent in Cuba’s next reciprocity treaty and urging a prompt solution of this matter so vital to the Cuban cigar industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forgottenbooks.com/en/readbook/TheCubaReview_10559666#106|title=The Cuba Review|website=www.forgottenbooks.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A German [[Citizenship|Citizen]] in the United States in 1916, he was considered [[prisoner of war]], and put under [[house arrest]] in his mansion in [[Mount Kisco, New York|Mount Kisko]], New York. In 1919 he moved to [[San Sebastián|San Sebastian]], [[Spain]] and in 1921 to [[Lucerne]], [[Switzerland]] where he applied for a Swiss passport. Owner of [[plantation]]s and other properties in Cuba, he lost a great part of his fortune by [[Confiscation]] in 1960 after the [[Cuban Revolution]]. He died only one year later. Garbade was married four times. Theodor jr, is son of his first spouse Graziella Aguirre del Monte who died in 1909.

'''Theophostic Counseling''' was developed in the United States during the mid-1990s  Ed Smith, a Baptist minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equip.org/articles/theophostic-prayer-ministry-part-one-/ "Theophostic Prayer Ministry (Part One) – Christian Prayer, Occult Visualization, or Secular Psychotherapy?"], ''Christian Research Journal'', volume 29, number 3 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; After concerns about legal liabilities associated with offering counseling services, Smith later changed the name to '''Theophostic Prayer Ministry'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theophostic.com/resources/1/pdf/PST001.pdf], "Christian Research Institute" Position Paper: PST001, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

Its name comes from the Greek ''theo'' (God) and quasi-Greek ''phostic'' (light), and it is often associated with the Christian [[Inner Healing Movement]]. Smith says people are being delivered from phobias, depressions, anxiety disorders, [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]]s, dissociative personality disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, sexual addictions, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders, and homosexuality through Theophostic principles. The name Theophostic is a registered trademark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theophostic.com/aboutus.aspx]''Business Information'' paragraph on ''About Us'' page of www.theophostic.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/february5/19.18.html?start=2 |title=''Christianity Today'', February&amp;nbsp;5, 2001 |publisher=Christianitytoday.com |date=February 5, 2001 |accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few empirical evaluations of Theophostic Ministry are available, although Christian psychologist Fernando Garzon says that current case study and survey data has yielded clinically significant changes in client symptom levels, and high degrees of client and practitioner satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.counseling.org/knowledge-center/vistas/by-year2/vistas-2004/docs/default-source/vistas/vistas_2004_26 Cognitive restructuring through contemplative inner healing prayer.] ''VISTAS: Perspectives on Counseling'' American Counseling Association Press, Garzon, F. (2004).]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Smith's definition of Theophostic Prayer Ministry is that "Theophostic is a ministry of helping emotionally wounded people to acknowledge and to identify the true source of their inner emotional pain and find lasting peace through receiving personalized truth directly from the Lord."&lt;ref name="Smith 2004"&gt;Smith, Ed M. ''Freedom from Performance-based Spirituality'', DVD, Theophostic Prayer Ministry (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==
Smith lists fourteen basic principles of Theophostic Prayer Ministry,:&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Edward M. ''Healing Life’s Hurts through Theophostic Prayer'', p. 39, New Creation Publishing (2002, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

1.  Our present situation is rarely the cause of our ongoing emotional pain.
 
2.  Everything we presently know, feel or are mentally aware of has its roots in a first-time experience.

3.  If we try to resolve our present conflicts without resolving our historical lie-based woundedness, we will find only temporary relief for our emotional pain. However, if we find renewal for our past, we can redeem our present.

4.  Since many of the negative emotions we currently feel are reflections of the past, they provide opportunities for the wounds of our lives to be exposed and thus for renewal to occur.

5.  To facilitate emotional renewal, we need to identify the three basic elements in the renewal process: (1) the present emotional pain, (2) the original memory container and (3) the original lie(s) implanted in the memory container.

6.  People are in emotional bondage due to two basic factors, belief and choice. These two factors are rooted in the context of deception.

7.  When we believe a lie, the outcome will often have much the same consequences as though it were true.

8.  To be free of the lies we believe, we must identify and own the lies rather than suppress or deny we believe them before we can be free from them.

9.  In the midst of our “darkness”, we must come to realize how utterly bound we are to the lie and how helpless we are to overcome its debilitating grip on our lives apart from God’s divine intervention.

10. No person, including ourselves, is capable of talking us out of the lies we believe. We will be free only when we receive the truth from the One who is Truth (John 14:6, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life").

11. When we know the truth experientially, having received truth from God in our memory experience, we can walk in genuine maintenance-free victory in these areas of our lives.

12. In time of crisis or in emotionally charged life situations, our experiential knowledge tends to override our logical truth.

13. Lie-based pain can only be removed as the lies causing the pain are replaced with truth, whereas, sin-based pain can only be dealt with through the cross of Jesus.

14. Mind renewal is a lifelong process.

== The Theophostic Prayer Ministry Process ==
Participants in a typical Theophostic Prayer Ministry session are the ministry recipient, a ministry facilitator and optionally a prayer partner.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2007, p.82, 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ministry facilitator ensures that the ministry recipient understands the process before the session begins.&lt;ref&gt;Garzon, Fernando, Psy.D., Editor (2008). ''Pursuing Peace – Case Studies Exploring the Effectiveness of Theophostic Prayer Ministry'', p. 59. Xulon Press. {{ISBN|978-1-60647-202-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2007, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

The facilitator begins the session with a prayer of encouragement.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2007, p.93, 225&lt;/ref&gt;

The ministry recipient closes his eyes and concentrates on feeling the emotional pain from which he is seeking relief. The purpose of focusing on the emotion is to allow his mind to drift back to a related memory&lt;ref name="CRJ2"&gt;[http://www.equip.org/articles/theophostic-prayer-ministry-part-one-/ "Theophostic Prayer Ministry (Part One) – Christian Prayer, Occult Visualization, or Secular Psychotherapy?"], ''Christian Research Journal'', volume 29, number 3 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
. That memory is of a situation that the recipient regards as painful and which he has interpreted to form a belief about himself or his situation.&lt;ref name="CRJ2" /&gt;  The event that is contained in the memory may have occurred many years ago, for example in the person’s childhood.&lt;ref name="CRJ2" /&gt; The emotion provides a bridge to the belief.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Edward M. (2007). ''Theophostic Prayer Ministry, Basic Training Seminar 2007, DVD Sessions, Disk 1, New Creation Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ministry recipient describes the memory to the facilitator.&lt;ref name="CRJ2" /&gt; The facilitator asks the recipient some questions that will enable the recipient to drill down to the core belief housed in this memory that is troubling him. The questions are not [[leading question]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Edward M. ''Healing Life’s Hurts through Theophostic Prayer'', Theophostic Prayer Ministry Guidelines, p. 256, New Creation Publishing (2002, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; as the facilitator does not assume anything about the memory’s content. Rather they are open questions, posed to help the recipient himself to identify the core belief. This core belief is known in TPM parlance as a “lie” that causes lie-based pain. The lie arises from the recipient’s interpretation of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Edward M. ''Healing Life’s Hurts through Theophostic Prayer'', p. 145, New Creation Publishing (2002, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a rape victim may have formed a belief that she is dirty or shameful, whereas she was actually an innocent victim. Though her belief is false, it has the same impact on her emotional state now as if it were true.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2007, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the recipient has identified the core troublesome belief, the facilitator prays, asking the Lord Jesus to provide the recipient with his perspective, that is, what he would like the recipient to know.&lt;ref name="Smith 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CRJ2" /&gt; The Lord answers that prayer in various ways. He might provide his truth to the recipient by means of a mental picture, a feeling, a scripture, a word, a realization or some other way.&lt;ref name="CRJ2" /&gt; The truth received from Jesus replaces the painful lie previously believed.&lt;ref name="CRJ2" /&gt; The result is peace.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2007, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzon 2008, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Every person believes not just one, but many lies of the kind that lead to present emotional pain. Each lie can be eliminated with the same process.&lt;ref name="CRJ2" /&gt;

== Research ==
In his 2008 book,&lt;ref&gt;Garzon 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Fernando Garzon, an associate professor in the Center for Counselling and Family Studies at Liberty University,&lt;ref&gt;Garzon 2008, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; describes his team’s two-year-long outcomes-based case study research project that evaluated TPM. The research team found very clear preliminary results that showed a correlation between TPM treatment and symptom reductions.&lt;ref name="Garzon 2008, p. 93"&gt;Garzon 2008, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;  Garzon wrote that the case studies strongly support the need for randomized comparative or control group studies.&lt;ref name="Garzon 2008, p. 93" /&gt;

Garzon had conducted preliminary practitioner studies in 2001 which showed promise, concluding that "...outcome-based case studies and randomized clinical trials should proceed on TPM to ascertain whether the therapeutic perception of efficacy displayed in this survey actually has merit..." He also found that a wide variety of people were practicing Theophostic Ministry at that time, including pastors, lay counselors, and psychologists. According to Garzon, this raised questions about some practitioners' level of training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h6x88387wv80341r/ |title=Theophostic Ministry: Preliminary Practitioner Survey – ''Pastoral Psychology'', Volume 53 Number May 5, 2005, Fernando Garzon and Margaret Poloma |issn=0031-2789 |accessdate=April 18, 2011 |doi=10.1007/s11089-005-2582-1 |volume=53 |issue=5 |journal=Pastoral Psychology |pages=387–396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
A Kentucky journalist has associated Theophostic Prayer Ministry with [[Recovered Memory Therapy]], an approach now widely discredited after discovery of false memory phenomena&lt;ref name=Brandon1997&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brandon, S. |author2=Boakes, J. |author3=Glaser, D. |author4=Green, R. |author5=MacKeith, J. |author6= Whewell, P.  | year = 1997 | title = Reported recovered memories of child sexual abuse: Recommendations for good practice and implications for training, continuing professional development and research | journal = Psychiatric Bulletin | volume = 21 | pages = 663–665 | doi = 10.1192/pb.21.10.663 | issue = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
on the basis that Theophostic Prayer Ministry also presupposes the possibility of repression or [[Memory inhibition#Evidence against inhibition in memory|memory inhibition]],&lt;ref&gt;Controversial international ministry operates from Campbellsville – Central Kentucky News Journal, July 2, 2003 by Jan Fletcher&lt;/ref&gt; A critical entry from [[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]] also seeks to associate Theophostic Ministry with [[Recovered Memory Therapy]], although the article does not identify the aspects of Theophostic Prayer Ministry that merit the assertion. It also claims that Theophostic Prayer Ministry has added beliefs about [[demonic possession]], [[Satanic abuse|Satanic influence]], direct communication with "[[Jesus Christ]] or the Holy Spirit" and "unique concepts about the inner workings of the mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org//theophostic.htm |title=Menu: Theophostic Counseling |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org//theophostic3.htm |title=Theophostic Counseling (TPM) TPM counseling: the process and reaction |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Smith himself strongly repudiates Recovered Memory Therapy,&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2007, p.215&lt;/ref&gt; and in recent years he has taught that it is counter-productive to pursue or even allow demonic confrontations in a ministry session.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2007, p.124-126&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his Basic Training Seminar Manual (and in each of the training videos), Smith warns strongly against making any suggestions that might affect the actual content of a memory,&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2007, p.129-133&lt;/ref&gt; and he lists ten ways in which TPM differs from RMT.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2007, p.215-218&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, once a core belief about self has been identified through the memory (not in the memory per se), Smith does "invite the Lord" to speak truth to the ministry recipient concerning that belief.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2007, p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article about TPM in the Christian Research Journal,&lt;ref name="CRJ2" /&gt; Elliot Miller said that to accuse TPM of practicing recovered memory therapy and visualization is to betray ignorance or bias against TPM that refuses to be corrected by clear and consistent facts.

A Christian psychologist, David Entwistle, has expressed concerns with its practice: "TPM follows in the lineage of 'healing of memory' techniques, though it departs from that lineage in a number of important respects. Numerous concerns exist surrounding insufficient attempts to ground TPM in biblical concepts; inadequate and often flawed explanations of basic psychological processes; dubious claims about the prevalence of [[Dissociative identity disorder|DID]], [[Satanic ritual abuse|SRA]], and demonic activity; estimates of traumatic abuse that exceed empirical findings; and the failure to sufficiently appreciate the possibility of [[iatrogenic]] memory contamination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6566/is_1_32/ai_n29090065/pg_10/?tag=content;col1 |title=Shedding light on Theophostic Ministry 1: practice issues – ''Journal of Psychology and Theology'', Spring 2004, by David N.

Entwistle raises concern over empirical validity, with questions about literal appearances of God, as Entwistle interprets claimed perceptions of truth, including spontaneous visualizations of Christ; ethical and legal issues relating to guarantees of healing; application of TPM to a variety of mental disorders without empirical validation; the legal question of whether it should be considered a religious intervention or a counseling procedure – and whether this was settled by changing the name from Theophostic Counseling to Theophostic Ministry; and the failure of Smith to welcome public analysis and critique of TPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6566/is_1_32/ai_n29090066/pg_8/?tag=content;col1 |title=Shedding light on Theophostic Ministry 2: ethical and legal issues – ''Journal of Psychology and Theology'', Spring 2004, by David N. Entwistle |publisher=Findarticles.com |accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cumberland County, Maine, sexual-abuse charges against pastor Thomas Wright were laid after a church member's memory surfaced during Theophostic sessions, of Wright allegedly abusing a child. When the case went to trial in 2002, the charges were thrown out by the District Attorney because evidence was based on ‘unconventional and biased therapeutic methods’. The District Attorney noted that these methods were considered unreliable by the American Psychological Society. In Australia, a psychologist was found guilty of malpractice for using Theophostic methods in 2006 by the Queensland Health Practitioners Tribunal. The tribunal found that Irene Moreau, who practiced from a Christian counselling centre in Brisbane, 'inappropriately used Theophostic Prayer Ministry as a counselling technique'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-130383209.html |title=AAP General News (Australia) Article date: October&amp;nbsp;25, 2006 |publisher=Highbeam.com |date=October 25, 2006 |accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners of inner healing techniques such as TPM frequently do not have formal training in psychology or counseling, although Fernando Garzon suggests that this in many cases may be beneficial, saying: "...it may serve people who might not get help otherwise, cannot afford professional therapy, do not wish to use insurance, or have access to counseling limited by managed care. Others belong to churches in which the pastor is either not trained, not interested, or not available (due to having too many other pastoral duties) to meet the needs for pastoral counseling. Still others simply may trust lay people, whom they know, more than a therapist, whom they do not know. In addition, the training itself may benefit the lay counselors spiritually and emotionally."&lt;ref&gt;Lay Christian Counseling and Client Expectations for Integration in Therapy ''Journal of Psychology and Christianity'' (in press) Garzon et al, Liberty University&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to questions about the efficacy, safety and reliability of TPM, it has also divided Christian observers with regard to the soundness of its theology. In the conclusion of their paper ''A theological analysis of Theophostic Ministry'', Bryan Maier and Philip Monroe put it this way: "...on the issues of sin and healing, the question remains for Christian counselors and the evangelical community as a whole as to whether Smith's "theological basis" is consistent with responsible biblical doctrine. We do not think that Smith has warrant to make this claim. Furthermore, we think these differences are so significant that we advise great caution before engaging in this ministry – whether as a client or as facilitator."&lt;ref name="maier"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maier|first1=Bryan N.|date=Fall 2003|title=A Theological Analysis Of Theophostic Ministry|url=http://www.galaxie.com/article/trinj24-2-01|journal=[[Trinity Journal (theology)|Trinity Journal]]|volume=24|issue=2|pages=169–188|issn=0360-3032|oclc=2243858|ref=maier}}&lt;!--|publisher=Trinity Evangelical Divinity School--&gt;&lt;!--http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=rfh&amp;AN=ATLA0001406507&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Angry mob of four.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's depiction of a prototypical angry mob staging a revolt]]

A '''user revolt''' is a social conflict in which [[User (system)|users]] of a [[website]] collectively and openly protest a website host's or [[Internet forum#Administrator|administrator's]] instructions for using the website. Sometimes it happens that the website hosts can control a website's use in certain ways, but the hosts also depend on the users to comply with voluntary social rules in order for the website to operate as the hosts would like. A user revolt occurs when the website users protest against the voluntary social rules of a website, and use the website in a way that is in conflict with the wishes of the website host or administrators.

A user revolt is a process starting with a triggering event, then a [[rebellion]], then a response to the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mashable.com/2009/05/16/why-revolts-occur/#o9DZjzq0zgq1 |title=Why Social Media Revolts Take Place (and How We Might Prevent Them) |first=Ben |last=Parr |work=mashable.com |date=16 May 2009 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional media like newspapers and television broadcasting, if the media outlet did something to upset readers, they rarely had to fear a hostile audience reaction.&lt;ref name="Douglas 2008"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gawker.com/348607/how-the-internets-biggest-social-news-site-saved-itself-again |title=How The Internet's Biggest Social News Site Saved Itself (Again) |first=Nick |last=Douglas |work=gawker.com |date=24 January 2008 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because in traditional media, the viewers have limited ability to discuss among themselves how to organize to protest the media outlet they are all sharing.&lt;ref name="Douglas 2008"/&gt; Some Internet media outlets differ in that their community of users can easily contact each other, organize, and present a coordinated revolt against any given media company.&lt;ref name="Douglas 2008"/&gt; Sometimes they can even do this using that media company's own hosted forums.&lt;ref name="Douglas 2008"/&gt;

==Distinction from Internet-based activism==
[[Internet-based activism]] is sometimes called a user revolt when website users protest the terms of a website while using that website for other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mashable.com/2011/12/07/social-media-uprising-activism/#P73tMy2p5iqs |title=9 Social Media Uprisings That Sought to Change the World in 2011 |first=Zoe |last=Fox |work=mashable.com |date=7 December 2011 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify||date=December 2015}} A distinction between a user revolt and Internet-based activism could be that in a user revolt, an objective of the protest is to revolt against the website itself. In Internet-based activism, the primary goal of the protest is something other than reforming a website, although websites which create barriers to the larger protest may incidentally experience a user revolt for participating in the larger conflict. An example of a situation in which Internet activism includes a user revolt might be when users wish to engage in prohibited political discussion, but a government compels the website host to censor those discussions. The core conflict in this case is between users and the government, and not that the website itself as a communication medium. However, when the website as a communication medium chooses to create barriers to communication for users, then users of the website organize a user revolt even when the primary objective is something other than a website protest.

Examples of Internet-based activism which led to user revolts include [[Social media and the Arab Spring]] and the [[Twitter Revolution]].

==Triggers==
The many triggers of user revolt can be roughly split into three broad categories, including unwelcomed changes to technical features,  unwelcomed changes to policies, and heavy handedness of host platforms in dealing with core members.

==Examples==

===Wikipedia===

====Spanish fork====
{{main|Enciclopedia Libre Universal en Español}}

The Enciclopedia Libre was founded by contributors to the [[Spanish Wikipedia|Spanish-language Wikipedia]] who decided to start an independent project.  Led by Edgar Enyedy, they left Wikipedia on 26 February 2002, and created the new website, hosted free by the [[University of Seville]], with the freely licensed articles of the Spanish-language Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Nathaniel Tkacz|Tkacz]]|first=[[Nathaniel Tkacz|Nathaniel]]|title=The Spanish Fork: Wikipedia's ad-fuelled mutiny|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-01/20/wikipedia-spanish-fork|newspaper=Wired UK|date=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The split was provoked over concern that Wikipedia would accept advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://networkcultures.org/cpov/2011/01/15/spanish_fork/ |title=‘Good luck with your WikiPAIDia’: Reflections on the 2002 Fork of the Spanish Wikipedia |first=Nathaniel |last=Tkacz |work=networkcultures.org |date=15 January 2011 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Wikipedia made a commitment to not use advertising, the Spanish fork attracted no more attention, and was mostly abandoned within a year of its founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lih|first1=Andrew|title=The Wikipedia revolution : how a bunch of nobodies created the world's greatest encyclopedia|date=2009|publisher=Hyperion|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4013-0371-6|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AWuZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT273&amp;lpg=PT273&amp;dq=wikipedia+spanish+fork+advertising&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Kub6TpjjqF&amp;sig=CgsAYVMbDYRnOglsnJIy_QzioBQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBWoVChMI6bW64r6jxwIVxXE-Ch0HxwDW#v=onepage&amp;q=wikipedia%20spanish%20fork%20advertising&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/12/02/wikipedia-has-a-ton-of-money-so-why-is-it-begging-you-to-donate-yours/ |title=Wikipedia has a ton of money.

====VisualEditor====
{{main|VisualEditor}}

''[[The Daily Dot]]'' suggested that the Wikimedia Foundation's pursuit of more users may be at the risk of alienating the existing editors.&lt;ref name="TheDailyDot"/&gt; Some experienced editors have expressed concerns about the rollout and bugs, with the [[German Wikipedia]] community voting overwhelmingly against making the VisualEditor the new default, and expressing a preference for making it an "opt-in" feature instead.&lt;ref name="TheDailyDot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theregister-buggy"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Register]]|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/01/wikipedians_reject_wysiwyg_editor/ |title=Wikipedians say no to Jimmy's 'buggy' WYSIWYG editor |author=  Andrew Orlowski|date=2013-08-01 |accessdate=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these complaints, the Wikimedia Foundation continued with the rollout to other languages.&lt;ref name="TheDailyDot"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Daily Dot]]|url=http://www.dailydot.com/business/wikipedia-visual-editor-wysiwyg/ |title=Will Wikipedia's pretty new editing software solve its recruitment crisis? |author= Tim Sampson  |date=2012-07-04 |accessdate=2013-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Register]]'' said, "Our brief exploration suggests it certainly removes any need to so much as remember what kind of parenthesis belongs where."&lt;ref name="TheRegister Sharwood 2013"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Register]]|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/06/07/wysiwyg_wikipedia_writer_lands_in_july/ |title=Wikimedia edges closer to banishing Wikitext |author= Simon Sharwood|date=2013-06-07 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economist]]''{{'}}s L.M.,  said it is "the most significant change in Wikipedia's short history."&lt;ref name="TheEconomist"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Economist]]|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/12/changes-wikipedia |title=Changes at Wikipedia: Seeing things |author= L.M.  |date=2011-12-13 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Softpedia]]'' ran an article titled "Wikipedia's New VisualEditor Is the Best Update in Years and You Can Make It Better".&lt;ref name="softpedia-best"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Softpedia]]|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Wikipedia-s-New-VisualEditor-Is-the-Best-Update-in-Years-and-You-Can-Make-It-Better-365072.shtml |title=Wikipedia's New VisualEditor Is the Best Update in Years and You Can Make It Better |author=Lucian Parfeni|date=2013-07-02 |accessdate=2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some opponents have said that users may feel belittled by the implication that "certain people" are confused by wiki markup and therefore need the VisualEditor.&lt;ref name="Simonite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/520446/the-decline-of-wikipedia/|title=The Decline of Wikipedia: Even As More People Than Ever Rely on It, Fewer People Create It|last=Simonite|first=Tom|date=October 22, 2013|work=[[MIT Technology Review]]|accessdate=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Daily Dot'' reported on 24 September 2013 that the Wikimedia Foundation had experienced a mounting backlash from the English Wikipedia community, which criticised the VisualEditor as slow, poorly implemented and prone to break articles' existing text formatting. In the resulting "test of wills" between the community and the Foundation, a single volunteer administrator overrode the Wikimedia Foundation's settings to change the availability of VisualEditor from opt-out to opt-in. The Foundation acquiesced, but vowed to continue developing and improving the VisualEditor.&lt;ref name=thereg&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Register]]|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/09/25/wikipedia_peasants_revolt/|title=Revolting peasants force Wikipedia to cut'n'paste Visual Editor into the bin|author=Andrew Orlowski|date=2013-09-25|accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dd-kww"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailydot.com/news/wikipedia-visualeditor-kww-patch/|title=Wikipedia faces revolt over VisualEditor|work=The Daily Dot|author=Tim Sampson|date=2013-09-24|accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Superprotect====
[[File:WMF building wiki wall in August 2014 caricature.jpg|thumb|right|Satirical cartoon depicting the Wikimedia Foundation building a wall to prevent the volunteer Wikimedia community from participating in Wikipedia]]

"Superprotect" was the name for a [[superuser]] tool granted to [[Wikimedia Foundation]] staff but denied to all Wikimedia community members starting in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Wikipedia contributors listed in history|title=Wikipedia:Protection policy|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Protection_policy#Superprotect|website=Wikipedia|accessdate=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2016}} Wikimedia Foundation staff used the tool to force the installation of the Wikimedia Foundation's software against the wishes of the Wikimedia community.&lt;ref name="Lih 2015"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/opinion/can-wikipedia-survive.html |title=Can Wikipedia Survive? |first=Andrew |last=Lih |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=20 June 2015 |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleinz 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Wikipedia-Superprotect-Streit-spitzt-sich-zu-2293513.html |title=Wikipedia: Superprotect-Streit spitzt sich zu  |first=Torsten |last=Kleinz|work=heise.de |publisher=[[Heinz Heise]] |date=16 August 2014 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict was unprecedented.&lt;ref name="Lih 2015"/&gt; [[Erik Möller]], then director of the Wikimedia Foundation, managed the Superprotect tool.&lt;ref name="Kleinz 2014"/&gt; The software in dispute was [[MediaViewer]], which was a software feature that guided Wikipedia readers into viewing images in a certain way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.golem.de/news/superschutz-wikimedia-stiftung-zwingt-deutschen-nutzern-mediaviewer-auf-1408-108522.html |title=Superschutz: Wikimedia-Stiftung zwingt deutschen Nutzern Mediaviewer auf|first=Friedhelm |last=Greis |work=golem.de |date=12 August 2014 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikimedia commentator [[Andrew Lih]] described the superprotect feature as "[[Orwellian]]-sounding".&lt;ref name="Lih 2015"/&gt;

The MediaViewer and Superprotect conflict between the Wikimedia community and the Wikimedia Foundation was called a revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/08/18/class_war_wikipedias_workers_revolt_after_bourgeois_papershufflers_suspend_democracy/ |title=Class war! Wikipedia's workers revolt again |first=Andrew |last=Orlowski |work=[[The Register]] |date=18 August 2014 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy demonstrated that the Wikimedia Foundation was unable to control the Wikimedia community with technical features, but rather, that mutual understanding and discussion among stakeholders would be required to develop Wikipedia's software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://netzpolitik.org/2014/kommentar-der-superprotect-streit-in-wikipedia-oder-souveraen-ist-wer-ueber-root-zugriff-verfuegt/ |title=Kommentar: Der "Superprotect"-Streit in Wikipedia, oder: Souverän ist, wer über Root-Zugriff verfügt |first=Leonhard |last=Dobusch |work=[[netzpolitik.org]] |date= 23 August 2014 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feature was reviewed and discussed by the Wikimedia community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2014-08-13/News_and_notes |title=Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost News and notes |author=Neotarf |work=en.wikipedia.org |date=13 August 2014 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2016}}

====Representative dismissals====
Wikimedia users organized a revolt to call for the removal of [[Arnnon Geshuri]], a member of the board of the Wikimedia Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mullin|first1=Joe|title=Wikipedia editors revolt, vote "no confidence" in newest board member|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/01/editors-demand-ouster-of-wikimedia-board-member-involved-in-no-poach-deal/|website=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|accessdate=27 January 2016|date=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=BBC staff|title=Wikipedia editors sign vote of no confidence|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35411208|website=[[BBC]]|accessdate=27 January 2016|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digg===

====Publishing of DVD unlock code====

In 2007 in the [[AACS encryption key controversy]] various Internet users began publishing the decryption code for the [[Advanced Access Content System]] on various websites. The impact was that the code enabled anyone to write simple software, for example [[DeCSS]], which enabled anyone else to [[Ripping|rip DVDs]] and copy the content as they liked. The release of the key and derivative ripping programs made the illicit distribution of copyrighted media much easier for anyone who wished to share content which was formerly locked by the AACS system.

The AACS codes were published in many places. One place in which they were published was the website [[Digg]].&lt;ref name="Nizza 2007"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/02/the-day-the-digg-users-revolted/?_r=0 |title=The Day Digg Users Revolted |first=Mike |last=Nizza |work=thelede.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2 May 2007 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/technology/03code.html?hp |title=In Web Uproar, Antipiracy Code Spreads Wildly |first=Brad |last=Stone |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 May 2007 |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://boingboing.net/2007/05/02/digg-users-revolt-ov.html |title=Digg users revolt over AACS key |first=Cory |last=Doctorow |work=boingboing.net |date=2 May 2007 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://readwrite.com/2007/05/04/what_happened_a_1 |title=What Happened At Digg? - ReadWrite |first=Jitendra |last=Gupta |work=readwrite.com |date=4 May 2007 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/2007/05/02/digital-rights-management-tech-cx_ag_0502digg.html |title=Digg's DRM Revolt |first=Andy |last=Greenberg |work=forbes.com |date=2 May 2007 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2007/05/aacs-la-internet-revolt-be-damned-this-fight-is-not-over/ |title=AACS LA: Internet "revolt" be damned, this fight is not over |first=Ken |last=Fisher |work=arstechnica.com |date=4 May 2007 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1, 2007, an article appeared on Digg's homepage that contained the [[encryption key]] for the [[Advanced Access Content System|AACS]] [[digital rights management]] protection of [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]]. Then Digg, "acting on the advice of its lawyers," removed posting submissions about the secret number from its database and banned several users for submitting it. The removals were seen by many Digg users as a capitulation to [[corporatocracy|corporate interests]] and an assault on free speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Stone | first = Brad | title = In Web Uproar, Antipiracy Code Spreads Wildly | pages = | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 2007-05-03 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/technology/03code.html | accessdate = 2007-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A statement by [[Jay Adelson]] attributed the article's take-down to an attempt to comply with [[cease and desist]] letters from the [[Advanced Access Content System]] consortium and cited Digg's [[Terms of Use]] as justification for taking down the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.digg.com/?p=73|title=Digg the Blog: What's Happening with HD-DVD Stories?|first=Jay|last=Adelson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some users defended Digg's actions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/31859/97/ |title=Cease and desist letters backfire horribly against AACS |publisher=TGdaily |date=2007-05-01 |accessdate=2009-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504015619/http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/31859/97/ |archive-date=2007-05-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weblog.infoworld.com/railsback/archives/2007/05/digg_losing_con.html |title=Digg losing control of their site |publisher=Weblog.infoworld.com |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222071122/http://weblog.infoworld.com/railsback/archives/2007/05/digg_losing_con.html |archivedate=2008-12-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanders |first=Tom |url=http://www.computing.co.uk/vnunet/news/2188970/drm-lobby-tries-hd-dvd-genie |title=DRM lobby tries to get HD DVD genie back into the bottle |publisher=Computing.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a whole the community staged a widespread revolt with numerous articles and comments being made using the encryption key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=7129|title=DailyTech: AACS Key Censorship Leads to First Internet Riot|first=Marcus|last=Yam|accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6615047.stm|title=BBC News: DVD DRM row sparks user rebellion|accessdate=2007-05-02 | date=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of the user response was so great that one of the Digg users referred to it as a "digital [[Boston Tea Party]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070504173353/http://www.forbes.com/technology/2007/05/02/digital-rights-management-tech-cx_ag_0502digg.html Forbes.com], Digg's DRM Revolt&lt;/ref&gt; The response was also directly responsible for Digg reversing the policy and stating: "But now, after seeing hundreds of stories and reading thousands of comments, you've made it clear.

====Digg v4 revolt and migration to Reddit====
When [[Digg]] redesigned their website in 2010 the community revolted and used the platform to advertise a user migration to the competitor, [[reddit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mashable.com/2010/08/30/users-revolt-against-new-digg/#6EazsZdx.aqO |title=Users Revolt Against New Digg |first=Vadim |last=Lavrusik |work=mashable.com |date=30 August 2010 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mashable.com/2011/01/03/reddit-2010-growth/#fdhicYEKeuqr |title=Reddit Grew 230% in 2010 at Digg's Expense |first=Ben |last=Parr |work=mashable.com |date=3 January 2011 |accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://readwrite.com/2010/08/30/digg_user_rebellion_reddit_on_front_page |title=Digg User Rebellion Continues: Reddit Now Rules the Front Page - ReadWrite |first=Frederic |last=Lardinois |work=readwrite.com |date=30 August 2010 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/07/23/with-digg-on-the-wane-where-are-its-former-power-users |title=With Digg on the Wane, Where Are its Former Power Users? |first=Simons |last=Owens |work=usnews.com |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/07/13/facebook-didnt-kill-digg-reddit-did/ |title=Facebook Didn't Kill Digg, Reddit Did |first=Paul |last=Tassi |work=forbes.com |date=13 July 2012 |accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pda/2010/aug/31/digg-redesign-revolt |title=Digg users revolt after redesign |first=Josh |last=Halliday |work=theguardian.com |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2010/08/reddit-digg.html |title=Reddit considers itself a benefactor of Digg user revolt |first=Mark |last=Milian |work=latimesblogs.latimes.com |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digg's version 4 release was initially unstable. The site was unreachable or unstable for weeks after its launch on August 25, 2010. Many users, upon finally reaching the site, complained about the new design and the removal of many features (such as bury, favorites, friends submissions, upcoming pages, subcategories, videos and history search).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gigaom.com/2010/08/26/digg-redesign-met-with-a-thumbs-down/ |title=Digg Redesign Met with a Thumbs Down |first1=Mathew, |last1=Ingram |date=August 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Rose replied to complaints on his blog, promising to fix the algorithm and restore some features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kevinrose.com/blogg/2010/8/27/digg-v4-release-iterate-repeat.html |title=Digg v4: release, iterate, repeat. |first1=Kevin |last1=Rose |date=August 27, 2010 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexis Ohanian]], founder of rival site [[Reddit]], said in an open letter to Rose:

{{quote|… this new version of digg reeks of [[venture capitalist|VC]] meddling. It's cobbling together features from more popular sites and departing from the core of digg, which was to "give the power back to the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alexisohanian.com/an-open-letter-to-kevin-rose |title=An open letter to Kevin Rose |first1=Alexis |last1=Ohanian |date=May 28, 2010 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Disgruntled users declared a "quit Digg day" on August 30, 2010, and used Digg's own auto-submit feature to fill the front page with content from Reddit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/digg_user_rebellion_reddit_on_front_page.php |title=Digg User Rebellion Continues: Reddit Now Rules the Front Page |publisher=ReadWriteWeb |first1=Frederic |last1=Lardinois |accessdate=August 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831122556/http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/digg_user_rebellion_reddit_on_front_page.php |archive-date=August 31, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/08/30/digg-users-lash-out-at-new-format-join-forces-with-reddit/ |title=Digg Users Lash Out At New Format, Join Forces with Reddit |publisher=Time Magazine |accessdate=August 31, 2010 |date=August 30, 2010 |first1=Megan |last1=Friedman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-20015042-36.html?part=rss&amp;amp;subj=news&amp;amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20 |title=Angry Digg users flood home page with Reddit links |publisher=CNet News |first1=Caroline |last1=McCarthy |accessdate=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reddit also temporarily added the Digg shovel to their logo to welcome fleeing Digg users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/30/reddit-digg-rivalry-heats_n_699225.html |title=Angry Users SLAM Digg With Links From Rival Reddit |publisher=The Huffington Post |accessdate=August 31, 2010 |first=Craig |last=Kanalley |date=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Reddit#IAmA and AMA}}

On July 2, 2015, Reddit began experiencing a series of blackouts as [[Internet forum#Moderators|moderators]] set popular subreddit communities to private, in an event dubbed "AMAgeddon" – a [[portmanteau]] of AMA ("ask me anything") and [[Armageddon]]. This was done in protest of the recent firing of Victoria Taylor, an administrator who helped organize citizen-led interviews with famous people on the popular "Ask me Anything" subreddit. Organizers of the blackout also expressed resentment about the recent severance of the communication between Reddit and the moderators of subreddits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-33379571 |title=Reddit in uproar after staff sacking |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=3 July 2015 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |access-date=3 July 2015 |quote="About 100 chat sections, or sub-reddits, that together have millions of readers are believed to have been shut. Reddit's only comment about the issue has been to say that it did not talk about 'individual employee matters'. The protests were led by the volunteer moderators of the AMA section, which said in an explanatory posting that they needed Ms Taylor to keep the sub-reddit functioning. Ms Taylor helped organise guests for AMAs and worked to verify that people due to answer questions were who they said they were. There had been no explanation of why she was suddenly sacked, said the administrators."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blackout intensified on July 3 when former [[Online community manager|community manager]] David Croach gave an AMA about being fired. Before deleting his posts, he stated that [[Ellen Pao]] dismissed him with one year of health coverage when he had cancer and did not recover quickly enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reddit: Laute Rufe nach Absetzung von CEO Ellen Pao|url=http://derstandard.at/2000018574154/Reddit-Laute-Rufe-nach-Absetzung-von-CEO-Ellen-Pao|accessdate=5 July 2015|date=4 July 2015|quote=Zwar sind einige Foren wieder entsperrt, trotzdem ist Pao weiterhin Ziel vielerlei Angriffe.

'''Zi Corporation''' was a [[software]] company based in [[Calgary]], Canada. The company was founded on 4 December 1987 as Cancom Ventures Inc, owning an [[Edmonton]] secretarial college and an industrial equipment rental business. On 30 August 1989 the name was changed to Multi-Corp Inc. In 1993, board member Michael Lobsinger took control of the company, became CEO, and turned the company towards the [[telecommunications]] industry, purchasing several privately held companies involved in the telecommunications businesses,&lt;ref name=China&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-strategy/china-calling/|title=China calling|publisher=[[Canadian Business]]|date=22 November 2004|last1=Wahl|first1=Andrew|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in November 1993, Multi-Corp entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Eric Chappell for a stroke-based [[Chinese language|Chinese]] text entry system which they referred to as the ''Jiejing Licenses''.&lt;ref name=Geist&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geist|first1=Richard|title=Investor Therapy: A Psychologist and Investing Guru Tells You How to Out-Psych Wall Street|date=23 Sep 2003|publisher=Crown Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-60960-916-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wholly owned subsidiary, Ziran Developments Inc, was formed to handle the Chinese text entry business. 
The company was listed on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] on 9 June 1995 (symbol MCU).&lt;ref name=Klein /&gt; Under Lobsinger, the strategic importance of the Chinese text entry grew, and Ziran was renamed Zi Corporation in 1996; ''Zi'' meaning ''character'' in Chinese. 
The telecommunications businesses were disposed of by 1997&lt;ref&gt;[http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/DisplayFiling.aspx?TabIndex=2&amp;FilingID=5832654&amp;companyid=97501&amp;ppu=%252fdefault.aspx%253fcompanyid%253d97501%2526amp%253bformtypeId%253d53 Zi Corp entry], Edgar Online.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1997, the parent company was renamed Zi Corporation to reflect the importance of the new business. In 1999, co-founder [[Gary Kovacs]] joined as COO.&lt;!-- left in 2003 for Macromedia --&gt;

Having started with Chinese on [[personal computer]]s, toward the end of the 1990s Zi's focus moved to text entry for all languages for [[mobile phone]]s and other handheld devices, where efficient entry of text traditionally has been challenging due to limitations of a physically small device.&lt;ref name=China /&gt; This new business area was quickly quite successful, especially in the Chinese market, and in 1998 Zi entered into licensing agreements with Ericsson (later [[Sony Ericsson]]), who at that time was a very significant player in the Chinese market.&lt;ref name=China /&gt;&lt;ref name="1998 Annual Report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zi Corporation 1998 Annual Report|url=http://globaldocuments.morningstar.com/documentlibrary/document/3405d5ef283dbaf1.msdoc/original|website=[[Morningstar, Inc.|Morningstar]]|publisher=Zi Corporation|accessdate=27 December 2015|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further license agreements with Ericsson and other companies were to follow, for a total of more than 1000 different device models being shipped with Zi text entry software,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Au|first1=Maggie|title=Sony Ericsson signs expansion deal with Zi Corp.|journal=[[Telecom Asia]]|date=16 September 2008|url=http://www.telecomasia.net/content/sony-ericsson-signs-expansion-deal-zi-corp-0|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
in more than 100 million devices.&lt;ref name=VisionMobile&gt;{{cite web|last1=Constantinou|first1=Andreas|title=Watchlist: The 100 million club|url=http://www.visionmobile.com/blog/2008/04/watchlist-the-100-million-club/|publisher=[[VisionMobile]]|date=2008|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of [[touch screen]] technology for mobile devices made the company follow up with software for handwriting recognition, with focus on languages such as Chinese and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].
In 2003, Mike Donnell took over as CEO from Lobsinger.&lt;ref name=China /&gt;
Zi Corporation was listed on [[NASDAQ]] from September 2007 .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/zi-corporation-application-to-trade-on-the-nasdaq-capital-market-approved-nasdaq-zica-766930.htm Zi Corporation Application to Trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market Approved]&lt;/ref&gt;

Text entry on devices with limited number of keys was early subject to a number of [[software patent]]s, and Zi was engaged in several costly patent disputes with [[Tegic Corporation]], later [[Nuance Communications]].
In August 2008, Nuance made a takeover bid to acquire the company for {{USD|40.4}} million, which the company declined. Shortly thereafter, Nuance filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Zi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kapko|first1=Matt|title=Nuance Sues Zi Corp.

==Products==
Zi's main product was ''EZiText'' [[predictive text entry]] software, in competition with solutions such as the original [[T9 (predictive text)|T9]] product from Tegic, later Nuance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/06/16/zi-announces-advanced-chinese-text-messaging-input-system/ |title=Zi announces advanced Chinese text messaging input system]|publisher=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other products include ''eZiType'', a predictive text entry product for mobile email users, for keyboard-based mobile devices, ''Qix'', a service discovery engine that provides a quick and easy method for accessing a phone's features, applications, and services, and ''Decuma'' which delivers an input method for pen-based devices by fusing handwriting recognition with predictive text technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zi Corporation Completes Acquisition of Assets of Decuma AB of Sweden|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050126005704/en/Zi-Corporation-Completes-Acquisition-Assets-Decuma-AB|accessdate=29 December 2015|date=26 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patent war==
There was a series of [[patent infringement]] lawsuits between Tegic, the holder of the T9 patents, and Zi:
* A patent infringement lawsuit by Zi against Tegic, filed in the District Court in Seattle for Japanese and Chinese character-based text input technologies was dismissed in September 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tegic Wins Patent Infringement Dispute; U.S. District Court In Seattle Summarily Dismisses Zi Corp Claims.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Tegic+Wins+Patent+Infringement+Dispute%3B+U.S.+District+Court+In...-a055731624|accessdate=29 December 2015|date=13 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In February 2002, the District Court for Northern California granted Zi a partial summary judgment that eZiText for alphabetic does not infringe on Tegic's patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In March 2002, the Federal District Court for the Western District of Washington granted Zi partial summary judgment stating that eZiText for alphabetic languages does not infringe Tegic's text input patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Zi+Claims+Second+Patent+Victory+Against+Tegic+Communications,+a+Unit...-a083757620|title=Zi Claims Second Patent Victory Against Tegic Communications, a Unit of AOL Time Warner.|date=14 March 2002|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In September 2002,  the U.S. District Court for Northern California awarded Tegic, owned by [[AOL]] [[Time Warner]], {{USD|9}} million in damages for Zi's infringement of two Tegic patents. Zi's claim that the two Tegic patents were based on existing methods of inputting Chinese ideographic characters were rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tegic Hails Sweeping Legal Victory in Patent Infringement Lawsuit Against Zi Corporation|url=http://www.timewarner.com/newsroom/press-releases/2002/09/05/tegic-hails-sweeping-legal-victory-in-patent-infringement-lawsuit|accessdate=29 December 2015|publisher=[[Time Warner]]|date=5 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In August 2008 Nuance filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Zi in the Federal Court in Toronto, Canada, where Nuance accuses Zi of infringing Canadian Patent Numbers 2,399,961 and 2,278,549, each entitled "Reduced Keyboard Disambiguating System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nuance and Its Subsidiary Tegic Communications File Patent Infringement Lawsuit Against Zi Corporation|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS143090+25-Aug-2008+BW20080825|accessdate=29 December 2015|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=25 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other controversies ==
* In 1995 the company sold stock to the wives of [[Alberta]] Premier [[Ralph Klein]] and his chief of staff [[Rod Love]] well below market value, with no payment required until they sold them. Klein had participated in a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the company’s Hong Kong office while Love served as a company director. Klein was later cleared of wrongdoing in a decision by Alberta's Ethics Commissioner [[Robert Curtis Clark|Bob Clark]],&lt;ref name=China /&gt;&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;{{cite web|title=Investigation Report: November 10, 1995 1 REPORT OF INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGATIONS RELATING TO THE HON.

* In 1998, Eric Chappell receives 4.5 million shares as compensation for transfer of all rights of the ''Jiejing Licenses'' to Zi. 3 million shares, representing 11.5% of the shares, are sold to Lancer Funds without disclosure, as is required by law.&lt;ref name=Western /&gt;
* In 2003, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] froze the assets of Lancer Group, a [[hedge fund]] investment management firm, when it discovered it owned 49.1% of Zi's shares, far beyond the 10% limit requiring disclosure. This was suspected to be for market manipulation, and the Lancer assets were taken over by an appointed receiver.&lt;ref name=China /&gt;&lt;ref name=Post /&gt; Zi entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zi Corporation and Marty Steinberg, Receiver for the Lancer Funds, Enter into Settlement Agreement|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/922658/000120445907000264/zic0223exh991.htm|publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]|accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
