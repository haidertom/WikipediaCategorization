==Education==
Ahmad Faizal was born in Ipoh, Perak. He received his primary education at Cator Avenue School, Ipoh and had his secondary education at Anderson School, Ipoh.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3447">'''Allotments''' in the [[tourism industry]] are used to designate a certain block of pre-negotiated [[Common carrier|carrier]] seats or [[hotel]] rooms which have been bought out and held by a [[travel]] organizer with a huge buying power like a wholesaler, tour operator or [[hotel consolidator]], and more rarely by a retail [[travel agent]].&lt;ref name=what&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourismnt.com.au/nt/system/galleries/download/Industry/DD_FS_Allotment.pdf |title= What are allotments?|publisher=Tourismnt.com.au|accessdate=2008-08-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080721194355/http://www.tourismnt.com.au/nt/system/galleries/download/Industry/DD_FS_Allotment.pdf| archivedate= 21 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allotments can be purchased for a specific period of time such as a whole [[season]], part of a season or for any single dates and then resold to travel partners and final customers around the globe. A couple of days prior to carrier departure/hotel [[check-in]] any unsold seats/rooms may be released back to the supplier if such an agreement exists between the two parties. An allotment release back period is also negotiated as part of the allotment contract (e.g. four days prior to check-in/departure).

==Negotiating allotments==
Allotments can be negotiated between a tour operator and a travel service supplier such as airline company/hotel chain, or between two travel organizers such as a tour operator and a retail travel agent. Either way the buyer needs to prove a consistent level of business, because allotments are hardly granted without any previous sales history.

Rooms or seats that have not been contracted between the travel company and the product supplier are handled as ‘on-request’, where each booking of an [[airline seat]] or hotel room needs to be confirmed with the supplier before being confirmed with the client.

==The allotment or allocation contract==
The amount of the contracted rooms/seats to be specified in the allotment contract is a result of the estimated, during the negotiation, volume of sales to be realized by the [[tour operator]]. Tour operators book a certain number of rooms in hotels or seats on carriers and have the right to use them by a given date, also known as a release date, that usually is some days prior to [[tourist]]'s arrival (hotels)/departure(carriers). The allotment contract reduces the risk of any unsold products by the supplier and grants relative price advantage to the travel organizer helping him to stay competitive on the market by offering extra [[discounts]].&lt;ref name=efficiency&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esade.edu/cedit2004/pdfs/64_succurro.pdf|title= The efficiency of allotment contracts with option|publisher= Marianna Succurro|accessdate=2008-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tour operators obtain discounts, through allotment or commitment contracts, primarily depend on the firm size and the bargaining power exercised; they can vary from 10% to 50% according to the period of the year, the destination, the quantity and quality of services contracted upon. Some big tour operators are able to obtain up to 70% of discount.&lt;ref name=tourism&gt;{{citation |title= Tourism Distribution Channels. Practices, Issues and Transformations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5397">'''Bengt-Åke Lundvall''' (born 1941) is an emeritus professor in economics at the Department Business and Management at [[Aalborg University]].

== Biography ==
Lundvall obtained his MA in economics at the University of Gothenburg in 1967.&lt;ref name="CV 2015"&gt;[http://personprofil.aau.dk/101394#/cv Bengt-Åke Lundvall] AAU personal profile. Accessed 01.02.2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lundvall started his academic career at the University of Gothenburg as Assistant professor in 1969. In 1973 he moved to the Aalborg University, where he was appointed associate professor. From 1992 to 1995 he was Deputy Director at DSTI/OECD. Since 1995 he is Professor at the Department of Business and Management at [[Aalborg University]],&lt;ref name="CV 2015"/&gt; where he founded the [[IKE Group]] 1977.

Lundvall was involved in the organization of [[Aalborg University]] during 1973-1977. A turning point in his career was his visit at the [[SPRU]] (UK) and [[Stanford]] (US) 1984. He was invited to become special invited professor at [[Tsinghua University]] in Beijing in 2004-06 and to become visiting professor at Sciences Po in Paris 2007-2010.

== Work ==
Lundvall's research is organized around a broad set of issues related to the [[innovation system]] (in fact this concept was created by him in 1985&lt;ref&gt;Innovation System Research Where it came from and where it might go. By Bengt-Åke Lundvall 2007&lt;/ref&gt;) and the [[learning economy]]. During 1992-95 he was Deputy Director at DSTI, [[OECD]]. He was involved in the preparation and follow up of the [[Lisbon Strategy]] 2000 and onwards.  Lundvall has co-ordinated the [[IKE-group]] in Aalborg since 1977 and the Danish network DRUID 1996-2001. Since 2002 he coordinates the worldwide research network Globelics.

In close collaboration with [[Christopher Freeman]], Bengt-Åke Lundvall developed the idea of innovation as an interactive process, in the first half of the eighties and the concept of [[National System of Innovation]] in the second half (Lundvall, 1985&lt;ref&gt;Lundvall, B.-Å. (1985). ''Product Innovation and User–Producer Interaction.'' Aalborg University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lundvall, 1988). In the beginning of the nineties he developed the idea of "the learning economy" in collaboration with Björn Johnson (Lundvall and Johnson, 1994).&lt;ref&gt;Lundvall, B.-Å.; Björn Johnson (1994). "The learning economy". ''Journal of Industry Studies'' '''1''' (2): 23–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the research carried by Fagerberg &amp; Verspagen (2007) on innovation studies,&lt;ref&gt;Innovation studies an emerging discipline (or what)? A study of the global network of innovation scholars. Jan Fagerberg &amp; Bart Verspagen 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Lundvall is number 4 in "The most important sources of scholarly inspiration" (only after [[Schumpeter]], [[Richard R. Nelson (economist)|Nelson]], and Lundvall's mentor [[Christopher Freeman|Freeman]])

[[File:Cobb douglas.png|300px|thumb|right|A two-input Cobb–Douglas production function with [[isoquant]]s]]

In [[economics]] and [[econometrics]], the '''Cobb–Douglas production function''' is a particular functional form of the [[production function]], widely used to represent the technological relationship between the amounts of two or more inputs (particularly physical capital and labor) and the amount of output that can be produced by those inputs. The Cobb–Douglas form was developed and tested against statistical evidence by [[Charles Cobb (economist)|Charles Cobb]] and [[Paul Douglas]] during 1927–1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cobb |first1=C. W. |last2=Douglas |first2=P. H. |year=1928 |title=A Theory of Production |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=18 |issue=Supplement |pages=139–165  |url=https://assets.aeaweb.org/assets/production/journals/aer/top20/18.1.139-165.pdf |accessdate=26 September 2016|quote= |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formulation ==
In its most standard form for production of a single good with two factors, the function is

: &lt;math&gt;Y=AL^\beta K^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''Y'' = total production (the real value of all goods produced in a year or 365.25 days)
* ''L'' = [[labour (economics)|labor]] input (the total number of person-hours worked in a year or 365.25 days)
* ''K'' = [[capital (economics)|capital]] input (the real value of all machinery, equipment, and buildings){{Clarify|reason=|date=October 2018}}
* ''A'' = [[total factor productivity]] and your usual depreciation by utility in day after{{Clarify|reason=|date=October 2018}}
* {{mvar|α}} and {{mvar|β}} are the [[Output elasticity|output elasticities]] of capital and labor, respectively. These values are constants determined by available technology.

Output elasticity measures the responsiveness of output to a change in levels of either labor or capital used in production, [[ceteris paribus]]. For example, if {{math|''α'' {{=}} 0.45}}, a {{math|1%}} increase in capital usage would lead to approximately a {{math|0.45%}} increase in output.

Sometimes the term has a more restricted meaning, requiring that the function display [[constant returns to scale]], meaning that doubling the usage of capital K and labor L will also double output Y. This holds if

:{{math|''α'' + ''β'' {{=}} 1}},

If

:{{math|''α'' + ''β'' &lt; 1}},

returns to scale are decreasing, and if

:{{math|''α'' + ''β'' &gt; 1}},

returns to scale are increasing. Assuming [[perfect competition]] and {{math|''α'' + ''β'' {{=}} 1}}, {{mvar|α}} and {{mvar|β}} can be shown to be capital's and labor's shares of output.

In its generalized form, the Cobb-Douglas function models more than two goods. The Cobb–Douglas function may be written as:&lt;ref name=Palgrave&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Murray|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781349588022|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EO40DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA862&amp;dq=cobb+douglas+utility+product+price&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl3MztwdfTAhUK3IMKHTgvBOIQ6AEITTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=cobb%20douglas%20utility%20product%20price&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=A \prod_{i=1}^L x_i^{\lambda_i}, \qquad x = (x_1, \ldots, x_L).&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''A'' is an efficiency parameter
* ''L'' is the total number of goods
* {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are the (non-negative) quantities of good consumed, produced, etc.
* &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; is an elasticity parameter for good ''i''

== History ==
[[Paul Douglas]] explained that his first formulation of the Cobb–Douglas production function was developed in 1927; when seeking a functional form to relate estimates he had calculated for workers and capital, he spoke with mathematician and colleague [[Charles Cobb (economist)|Charles Cobb]], who suggested a function of the form {{math|''Y'' {{=}} ''AL&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt;K''&lt;sup&gt;1−''β''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, previously used by [[Knut Wicksell]]. Estimating this using [[ordinary least squares|least squares]], he obtained a result for the exponent of labour of 0.75—which was subsequently confirmed by the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] to be 0.741. Later work in the 1940s prompted them to allow for the exponents on ''K'' and ''L'' to vary, resulting in estimates that subsequently proved to be very close to improved measure of productivity developed at that time.&lt;ref name="doug"&gt;{{Cite journal| authorlink = Paul Douglas | title = The Cobb-Douglas Production Function Once Again: Its History, Its Testing, and Some New Empirical Values | journal = Journal of Political Economy | volume = 84 | issue = 5 |pages = 903–916 | date = October 1976 | doi=10.1086/260489| last1 = Douglas | first1 = Paul H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major criticism at the time was that estimates of the production function, although seemingly accurate, were based on such sparse data that it was hard to give them much credibility.  Douglas remarked "I must admit I was discouraged by this criticism and thought of giving up the effort, but there was something which told me I should hold on."&lt;ref name="doug"/&gt; The breakthrough came in using [[US census]] data, which was [[cross-sectional data|cross-sectional]] and provided a large number of observations. Douglas presented the results of these findings, along with those for other countries, at his 1947 address as president of the [[American Economic Association]]. Shortly afterwards, Douglas went into politics and was stricken by ill health—resulting in little further development on his side.  However, two decades later, his production function was widely used, being adopted by economists such as [[Paul Samuelson]] and [[Robert Solow]].&lt;ref name="doug"/&gt;  The Cobb–Douglas production function is especially notable for being the first time an aggregate or economy-wide production function had been developed, estimated, and then presented to the profession for analysis; it marked a landmark change in how economists approached macroeconomics from a microeconomics perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |first= Jesus |last=Filipe |first2=F. Gerard |last2=Adams | title = The Estimation of the Cobb-Douglas Function: A Retrospective View | journal = Eastern Economic Journal  | volume = 31  | number = 3  | pages = 427–445  | year = 2005 |jstor=40326423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

The function has been criticised for its lack of foundation. Cobb and Douglas were influenced by statistical evidence that appeared to show that labor and capital shares of total output were constant over time in developed countries; they explained this by statistical fitting [[Least squares|least-squares regression]] of their production function. There is now doubt over whether constancy over time exists.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The Cobb–Douglas production function was not developed on the basis of any knowledge of engineering, technology, or management of the production process{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}. This rationale may be true given the definition of the Capital term. Labor hours and Capital need a better definition. If capital is defined as a building, labor is already included in the development of that building. A building is composed of commodities, labor and risks and general conditions.

It was instead developed because it had attractive mathematical characteristics{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}, such as [[Diminishing returns|diminishing marginal returns]] to either factor of production and the property that the optimal expenditure shares on any given input of a firm operating a Cobb Douglas technology are constant.  Initially, there were no utility foundations for it. In the modern era, some economists try to build models up from individual agents acting, rather than imposing a functional form on an entire economy{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}.  The Cobb–Douglas production function, if properly defined, can be applied at a micro-economic level, up to a macro- economic level.

However, many modern authors{{who|date=November 2015}} have developed models which give [[microeconomics|microeconomically based]] Cobb–Douglas production functions, including many [[New Keynesian]] models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Walsh | first = Carl | title = Monetary Theory and Policy | publisher = [[MIT Press]]  | edition = 2nd | location = Cambridge | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is nevertheless a mathematical mistake to assume that just because the Cobb–Douglas function applies at the microeconomic level, it also always applies at the [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] level. Similarly, it is not necessarily the case that a macro Cobb–Douglas applies at the disaggregated level.  An early microfoundation of the aggregate Cobb–Douglas technology based on linear activities is derived in Houthakker (1955).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Houthakker  | first = H.S.  | title = The Pareto Distribution and the Cobb–Douglas Production Function in Activity Analysis  | journal =  The Review of Economic Studies  | volume = 23  | number = 1  | pages = 27–31  | year = 1955 | doi=10.2307/2296148| jstor = 2296148  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cobb–Douglas utilities ==
The Cobb–Douglas function is often used as a [[utility function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Brenes | first = Adrián | title = Cobb-Douglas Utility Function | url = http://www.wiziq.com/tutorial/160571-Cobb-Douglas-Utility-Function | year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Palgrave /&gt; In this context the consumer is assumed to have finite wealth, and utility maximization takes the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\max_x u(x)= \max_{x_i} \prod_{i=1}^L x_i^{\lambda_i} \quad \text{ subject to the constraint } \quad \sum_{i=1}^L p_i x_i= w &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is the total wealth of the consumer and &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; are the prices of the goods. The utility may be maximized as follows. First, take the logarithm of the utility

:&lt;math&gt;\ln u(x)=\sum_{i=1}^L \lambda_i \ln x_i&lt;/math&gt;

Let {{math|''λ'' {{=}} ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''λ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Since the function &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x^\frac1\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is strictly monotone for {{math|''x'' &gt; 0}}, it follows that &lt;math&gt;u(x)=\tilde{u}(x)^{\frac1\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; represents the same preferences. Setting &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i = \frac{\lambda_i}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; it can be shown that
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^L \alpha_i = 1&lt;/math&gt;

The optimal solution is then:

:&lt;math&gt;\forall j: \qquad  x_j^\star=\frac{w \alpha_j}{p_j}.&lt;/math&gt;

An interpretation of this solution is that the consumer uses a fraction &lt;math&gt;\alpha_j&lt;/math&gt; of his wealth in purchasing good {{mvar|j}}.

The [[indirect utility function]] can be calculated by substituting the demand into the utility function. Ignoring a certain multiplicative constant which depends only on the &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt;s, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;v(p, w) = \frac{w}{\prod_{i=1}^L p_i^{\alpha_{i}}}&lt;/math&gt;

which is a special case of the [[Gorman polar form]]. The [[expenditure function]] is the inverse of the indirect utility function:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Varian Microeconomic Analysis 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|112}}

:&lt;math&gt;e(p, u) = \prod_{i=1}^L p_i^{\alpha_{i}} u&lt;/math&gt;

== Various representations of the production function ==
The Cobb–Douglas function form can be estimated as a linear relationship using the following expression:

:&lt;math&gt; \ln(Y) = a_0 + \sum_i a_i \ln(I_i) &lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt; Y = \text{output}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; I_i = \text{inputs}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; a_i = \text{model coefficients}&lt;/math&gt;

The model can also be written as
:&lt;math&gt; Y = (I_1)^{a_1} \cdot (I_2)^{a_2} \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

As noted, the common Cobb–Douglas function used in macroeconomic modeling is
:&lt;math&gt; Y = K^\alpha L^\beta &lt;/math&gt;

where ''K'' is capital and ''L'' is labor. When the model exponents sum to one, the production function is first-order [[homogeneous function|homogeneous]], which implies constant returns to scale—that is, if all inputs are scaled by a common factor greater than zero, output will be scaled by the same factor.

== Relationship to the CES production function ==
The [[constant elasticity of substitution]] (CES) production function (in the two-factor case) is

:&lt;math&gt; Y = A \left ( \alpha K^\gamma + (1-\alpha) L^\gamma \right )^{1/\gamma},&lt;/math&gt;

in which the limiting case {{math|''γ'' {{=}} 0}} corresponds to a Cobb–Douglas function, &lt;math&gt;Y=AK^\alpha L^{1-\alpha},&lt;/math&gt; with constant returns to scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Eugene |last=Silberberg |first2=Wing |last2=Suen |title=The Structure of Economics: A Mathematical Analysis |location=Boston |publisher=Irwin McGraw-Hill |edition=Third |year=2001 |isbn=0-07-234352-4 |chapter=Elasticity of Substitution |pages=238–250 [pp. 246–7] |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=7y9lQgAACAAJ&amp;pg=PA246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To see this, the log of the CES function,

: &lt;math&gt; \ln(Y) = \ln(A) + \frac{1}{\gamma} \ln \left (\alpha K^\gamma + (1-\alpha) L^\gamma \right )&lt;/math&gt;

can be taken to the limit by applying [[l'Hôpital's rule]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{\gamma\to 0} \ln(Y) = \ln(A) + \alpha \ln(K) + (1-\alpha) \ln(L).&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;Y=AK^\alpha L^{1-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Translog production function ===
The translog production function is an approximation of the CES function by a second-order [[Taylor polynomial]] about &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 0&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the Cobb–Douglas case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ernst R. |last=Berndt |first2=Laurits R. |last2=Christensen |title=The Translog Function and the Substitution of Equipment, Structures, and Labor in U.S. manufacturing 1929–68 |journal=[[Journal of Econometrics]] |volume=1 |issue=1 |year=1973 |pages=81–113 |doi=10.1016/0304-4076(73)90007-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R. F. |last=Wynn |first2=K. |last2=Holden |title=An Introduction to Applied Econometric Analysis |location=New York |publisher=Halsted Press |year=1974 |isbn=0-333-16711-2 |pages=62–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name translog stands for 'transcendental logarithmic'. It is often used in [[econometrics]] for the fact that it is linear in the parameters, which means [[ordinary least squares]] could be used if inputs could be assumed exogenous.

In the two-factor case above the translog production function is
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\ln(Y) &amp;= \ln(A) + \alpha \ln(K) + (1-\alpha) \ln(L) + \frac{1}{2} \gamma \alpha (1 - \alpha) \left[ \ln(K) - \ln(L) \right]^2 \\
&amp;= \ln(A) + a_K \ln(K) + a_L \ln(L) + b_{KK} \ln^2(K) + b_{LL} \ln^{2}(L) + b_{KL} \ln(K) \ln(L)  
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a_K&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_L&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_{KK}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_{LL}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;b_{KL}&lt;/math&gt; are defined appropriately. In the three factor case, the translog production function is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\ln(Y) &amp; = \ln(A) + a_L\ln(L) + a_K\ln(K) + a_M\ln(M) + b_{LL}\ln^2(L) +b_{KK}\ln^2(K) + b_{MM}\ln^2(M) \\
&amp; {} \qquad \qquad + b_{LK}\ln(L)\ln(K) + b_{LM}\ln(L)\ln(M) + b_{KM}\ln(K)\ln(M) \\
&amp;  = f(L,K,M).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = total factor productivity, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; = labor, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; = capital, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; = materials and supplies, and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; = output.

''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xyalAAAAIAAJ The Emerging States of French Equatorial Africa]''. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press, 1960. p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was affiliated to the ''[[Conseil national du patronat français]]'' (CNPF), the French National Employers Council.&lt;ref name="con"&gt;Bazenguissa-Ganga, Rémy. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=15Qza8LQcFMC Les voies du politique au Congo: essai de sociologie historique]''. Paris: Karthala, 1997. p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; A Permanent Secretariat coordinated the activities of the four territorial branches of COLPAEF.&lt;ref name="eme"/&gt;

In Gabon, COLPAEF affiliates included SYCOMIMPEX-GABON (traders' and importers' syndicate), ''Syndicat professionnel des usines de sciage et de placages du Gabon'' (S.P.U.S.P.D.G.) and ''Syndicat forestier du Gabon'' ('Forestry Union of Gabon'), out of which the latter was the most important.&lt;ref name="gab"/&gt; In Moyen-Congo, Fédération des petities et moyennes entreprise ('Federation of Small and Medium-sized Companies', founded in 1952), Syndicat des entrepreneurs du bâtiment et des travaux publics ('Construction and Public Works Entrepreneurs Union', founded in 1957) and SYCOMIMPEX du Congo (founded in 1958) were members of COLPAEF.&lt;ref name="con"/&gt;

COLPAEF was organizationally significantly weaker than its [[French West Africa|West African]] counterparts.&lt;ref name="eme"/&gt; The employers of French Equatorial Africa were generally highly individualistic, and often operated with little regard to the Labour Code.&lt;ref name="eme"/&gt; COLPAEF was entirely dominated by [[French people]]. Politically, the organization had limited influence. It came to accept decolonization in 1958, and in the [[Republic of the Congo]] the organization aided the newly formed government through trainings of some of its ministers.&lt;ref name="con"/&gt;

COLPAEF later transformed into '''''Union Interprofessionnelle de l'A.E.F.''''' (UNIAEF). After AEF was dissolved, contacts between CNPF and Central African employers association continued through Comité d'etudes et de liaison du patronat d'outre-mer (CELPUF).&lt;ref name="gab"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3914">The '''Companies Act 2014''' (No. 38 of 2014)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/bills28/acts/2014/a3814complete.pdf Companies Act, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; was signed into law by President [[Michael D. Higgins]] on 23 December 2014 to regulate [[company|companies]] under [[law of the Republic of Ireland|Irish law]]. It was a [[consolidation bill|consolidating]] and reforming piece of legislation, incorporating many of the provisions of the previous Companies Act 1963–2012 listed below.

==Previous Companies Acts==
To facilitate easy [[citation]] of the entire body of law affecting companies, each of the acts prior to 2005 includes a collective citation section which enables them to be collectively cited as "The Companies Acts 1963 - [year of current enactment]". The Interpretation Act, 2005 provided that the Companies Acts 1963 to 2001 may be referred to as "The Companies Acts". Legislation enacted subsequent to the Interpretation Act, 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0023/print.html#sched-partii Interpretation Act, 2005] Retrieved 2011-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt; includes a section providing that "the Companies Acts and this Act shall be read as one" (e.g. Section 11 of The Companies (Amendment) Act 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0020/sec0011.html#sec11 Section 11 of The Companies (Amendment) Act 2009] Retrieved 2011-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;). Therefore, it was then appropriate to cite the entire body of legislation in Ireland affecting companies as "The Companies Acts".

'''Don Edward Schultz''' (born January 20, 1934) is Professor Emeritus of Service at [[Northwestern University]]'s [[Medill]] School.  He's most notable for his research and writing on [[Integrated Marketing Communications]] (IMC).

==Education and early career==

Schultz earned a [[Bachelor of Business Administration]] from [[University of Oklahoma]] in 1957, a [[Master of Arts]] in [[Advertising]] from [[Michigan State University]] in 1975, and a Ph.D. in [[Mass Media]] from Michigan State in 1977. Schultz began his career in publication sales and management. In 1965,  he joined the firm of Tracy-Locke Advertising and Public Relations based in Dallas, Texas where he gained skills in [[advertising]] and [[marketing communications]]. 

==Academic career==
In the mid-1970s, Schultz began teaching advertising at the Michigan State University and in 1977, he joined the Faculty at Northwestern University where he became Department Chair and Associate Dean. &lt;ref&gt;Medill University, "Don E. Schultz," ''Biographical Notes,'' &lt;Online: http://www.medill.northwestern.edu/directory/faculty/don-e-schultz.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1991, Schultz was part of a team at the [[Medill School of Journalism]], [[Northwestern University]] which in conjunction with the [[American Association of Advertising Agencies]] (AAAA), began the first empirical study designed to investigate how [[integrated marketing communications]] was being used by practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, D. and Kitchen, P., "Integrated Marketing Communications in US Advertising Agencies: An Exploratory Study," ''Journal of Adaertising Research,'' Vol. 37, no, 5, 1997, pp.7-17&lt;/ref&gt; The study focused around understanding the concept and the importance of IMC and also to analyse the extent in which IMC was practiced in all major U.S advertising agencies. When this initial study was replicated by other studies in a number of countries; New Zealand, UK, US, Australia, India, Thailand, South Africa and the Philippines, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Kliatchko, J.G., "Towards a New Definition of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC)," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol 24, No. 1, 2005, pp. 8-9; Ichul, L., Han, D. and Schultz, D., "Understanding the Diffusion of Integrated Marketing Communications," ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' Vol. 44, No. 1, 2004, pp 31-45&lt;/ref&gt;, they demonstrated that the new IMC was far from a "short-lived managerial fad" but rather was "a very clear reaction by advertising agencies and their clients as they are affected by a multitude of factors such as new forms of information technology including development and usage of databases, media fragmentation, client desires for interaction/synergy, and global and regional coordination."&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen, P.J. and Schultz, D.E. "A Multi-Country Comparison of the Drive for IMC." ''Journal of Advertising Research,''Vol. 39, No. 1, 1999, p. 21; Shimp, T.A. ''Advertising Promotion and Other Aspects of Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Cengage, 2008, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Collectively these studies suggested that marketing communications was undergoing a transitional phase.

In 1993, Schultz and his team published the first text-book dedicated to IMC.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, D. E., Tannenbaum, S.I. and Lauterborn, R.F., ''Integrated Marketing Communications: Putting it together and making it work, '' Lincolnwood, Ill., NTC Business Books, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Their work, simply entitled, ''Integrated Marketing Communications,'' described IMC as a totally new way of looking at the whole of marketing communications, rather than looking at each of the parts separately. Also in 1993, Schultz and the Medill School at Northwestern University changed their curriculum to include a focus on this new idea of integrated marketing communications rather than the traditional program which had emphasised advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L.,''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, pp 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; 

Often referred to as the "father of integrated marketing",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2010/04/schultz.html Northwestern University, Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award, April 12, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Schultz is the author or co-author of 28 books and 150 trade/academic articles on [[marketing]]. &lt;ref&gt;Medill University, "Don E. Schultz," ''Biographical Notes,'' &lt;Online: http://www.medill.northwestern.edu/directory/faculty/don-e-schultz.html&lt;/ref&gt; His books include: ''Integrated Marketing Communications'' (1993); ''Communicating Globally'' (2000) and ''IMC: The Next Generation'' (2003).  He writes a regular column on Integrated Marketing for ''Marketing Management'' magazine, the trade publication of the [[American Marketing Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_tc_2_0?rh=i%3Astripbooks%2Ck%3ADon+E.+Schultz&amp;keywords=Don+E.+Schultz&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1301265925&amp;sr=1-2-ent&amp;field-contributor_id=B001H9XTPG Amazon author list]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
Schultz lectures and consults for various business groups and currently resides in the [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] metropolitan area. He is also the president and founder of Agora, Inc. (not to be confused with [[Agora, Inc.]]), a consulting firm based in Evanston, Il.

He was the recipient of:&lt;ref&gt;Medill University, "Don E. Schultz," ''Biographical Notes,'' &lt;Online: http://www.medill.northwestern.edu/directory/faculty/don-e-schultz.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Toronto August 2017.jpg|thumb|275px|Skyline and the [[Toronto Harbour|Inner Harbour]] seen from the [[Toronto Islands]] in August 2017]]
'''Downtown Toronto''' is the [[city centre]] and main [[central business district]] of [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Located entirely within the district of [[Old Toronto]], it is approximately 14 square kilometers in area, bounded by [[Bloor Street]] to the north, [[Lake Ontario]] to the south, the [[Don Valley River|Don Valley]] to the east, and [[Bathurst Street, Toronto|Bathurst Street]] to the west. It is also the governmental centre of the [[municipal government of Toronto|City of Toronto]] and the [[Government of Ontario|Province of Ontario]].

The area is made up of the Canada’s largest concentration of skyscrapers and businesses that form Toronto's skyline. Downtown Toronto has the third most skyscrapers in North America exceeding {{convert|200|m|ft|0}} in height, behind [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neighbourhoods==
[[File:Dundus Square.jpg|thumb|[[Yonge–Dundas Square]] is a [[public square]] and [[landmark]] at the southeast corner of the intersection of [[Yonge Street]] and [[Dundas Street (Toronto)|Dundas Street East]].]]
The retail core of the downtown is located along [[Yonge Street]] from Queen Street to College Street. There is a large cluster of retail centres and shops in the area, including the [[Toronto Eaton Centre]] indoor mall. There are an estimated 600 retail stores, 150 bars and restaurants, and 7 hotels. In recent years the area has been experiencing a renaissance as the [[Business Improvement District|Business Improvement Area]] (BIA) has brought in new retail and improved the cleanliness. The area has also seen the opening of the [[Dundas Square]] public square, a public space for holding performances and art displays. The area includes several live theatres, a movie complex at Dundas Square and the historic [[Massey Hall]]. Historical sites and landmarks include the Arts &amp; Letter Club, the Church of the Holy Trinity, Mackenzie House, Maple Leaf Gardens, Old City Hall, and the Toronto Police Museum and Discovery Centre.

The [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]], centred on the intersection of [[Bay Street]] and [[King Street, Toronto|King Street]] is the centre of [[economy of Canada|Canada's financial industry]]. It contains the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]], which is the largest in Canada and [[List of stock exchanges|seventh in the world by market capitalization]]. The construction of skyscrapers in downtown Toronto had started to rapidly increase during the 1960s.
[[File:Shot from Berczy Park, 2014 12 24 (9) (16075740266).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[St. Lawrence, Toronto|St. Lawrence]] is one of several historic districts in downtown Toronto.]] 
The area of [[St. Lawrence, Toronto|St. Lawrence]] to the east of the financial district is one of the oldest area of Toronto. It features heritage buildings, theatres, music, dining and many pubs. It is a community of distinct downtown neighbourhoods including the site of the original Town of York, which was Toronto's first neighbourhood, dating back to 1793. The area boasts one of the largest concentrations of 19th century buildings in Ontario. Of particular note are the St. Lawrence Hall, [[Cathedral Church of St. James (Toronto)|St. James' Cathedral]], [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Toronto|St. Michael's Cathedral]], [[St. Paul's Basilica]], the Enoch Turner School House, the Bank of Upper Canada, Le Royal Meridien King Edward Hotel, and the [[Gooderham Building]]. On Saturday there is a farmers market. Other historical districts in downtown Toronto include [[Cabbagetown, Toronto|Cabbagetown]], [[Corktown, Toronto|Corktown]], the [[Distillery District]], and [[Old Town, Toronto|Old Town]].

To the west of the financial district is the [[Entertainment District, Toronto|Entertainment District]]. It is home to hundreds of restaurants, nightclubs, sporting facilities, boutiques, hotels, attractions, and live theatre. The district was formerly an industrial area and was redeveloped for entertainment purposes in the early 1980s, becoming a major centre for entertainment. The redevelopment started with the [[Ed Mirvish|Mirvish]] family refurbishing of the [[Royal Alexandra Theatre]] and their construction of the [[Princess of Wales Theatre]]. The area is now the site of [[Roy Thomson Hall]] and the [[Canadian Broadcasting Centre]].
[[File:Royal Ontario Museum2.jpg|thumb|The [[Royal Ontario Museum]] is a [[museum]] of [[Art museum|art]], [[Culture|world culture]] and [[natural history]], located in the [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]] neighbourhood.]]
The [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]] area, to the north, north of Bloor Street and the [[Mink Mile]], has more than 700 designer boutiques, spas, restaurants, hotels, and world class galleries. It is a former village in its own right (prior to 1883) and since the early 1970s has developed into an up-scale shopping district. The intersection of Bloor and Yonge Streets is the intersection of the city's subway lines and is one of the busiest intersections in the city. At the intersection of Avenue Road and Bloor Street is the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], the largest museum of the city, with a diverse anthropological and natural history collection.

The [[Harbourfront, Toronto|Harbourfront]] area to the south was formerly an industrial and railway lands area. Since the 1970s, it has seen extensive redevelopment, including the building of the [[Rogers Centre]] stadium, numerous condominiums and the [[Harbourfront Centre]] waterfront revitalization. The area to the east of Yonge Street is still in transition, with conversion of industrial lands to mixed residential and commercial uses planned.

Among the important government headquarters in downtown Toronto include the [[Ontario Legislature]], and the [[Toronto City Hall]].

==Architecture==
{{main|Architecture of Toronto}}
[[File:Toronto August 2017 03.jpg|thumb|Downtown Toronto holds a large concentration of [[skyscrapers]].]]
In the 1970s, Toronto experienced major economic growth and surpassed [[Montreal]] to become the largest city in Canada. Many international and domestic businesses relocated to Toronto and created massive new skyscrapers downtown. All of the [[Big Five banks]] constructed skyscrapers beginning in the late 1960s up until the early 1990s.

Today downtown Toronto contains dozens of notable skyscrapers. The area's [[First Canadian Place]] is the tallest building in Canada at height of 298 metres (978&amp;nbsp;feet). The [[CN Tower]], once the tallest free-standing structure in the world, remains the tallest such structure in the Americas, standing at 553.33 metres (1,815&amp;nbsp;ft., 5&amp;nbsp;inches). Other notable buildings include [[Scotia Plaza]], [[Toronto-Dominion Centre|TD Centre]], [[Commerce Court]], the [[Royal Bank Plaza]], [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|The Bay]]'s flagship store, and the Fairmont [[Fairmont Royal York|Royal York Hotel]].

Since 2007, [[urban consolidation]] has been centred in downtown Toronto and as a result has been undergoing [[Manhattanization]] with the construction of new office towers, hotels and condos.

The term '''empowerment''' refers to measures designed to increase the degree of autonomy and self-determination in people and in communities in order to enable them to represent their interests in a responsible and self-determined way, acting on their own authority. It is the process of becoming stronger and more confident, especially in controlling one's life and claiming one's rights. Empowerment as action refers both to the process of self-empowerment and to professional support of people, which enables them to overcome their sense of powerlessness and lack of influence, and to recognize and use their resources. To do work with power.

The term empowerment originates from American [[community psychology]] and is associated{{by whom|date=June 2016}} with the social scientist [[Julian Rappaport]] (1981).&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, Julian. In praise of paradox. A social policy of empowerment over prevention, in: American Journal of Community Psychology, Vol. 9 (1), 1981, 1–25 (13)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the roots of empowerment theory extend further into history and are linked to Marxist sociological theory. These sociological ideas have continued to be developed and refined through Neo-Marxist Theory (also known as Critical Theory).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compsy.org.uk/rethemp.htm|title=Rethinking empowerment: shared action against powerlessness|last=Burton &amp; Kagan|first=|date=1996|website=compsy.org.uk|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[social work]], empowerment forms a practical approach of resource-oriented intervention. In the field of [[citizenship education (subject)|citizenship education]] and [[democratic education]], empowerment is seen{{by whom|date=June 2016}} as a tool to increase the responsibility of the citizen. Empowerment is a key concept in the discourse on promoting [[civic engagement]]. Empowerment as a concept, which is characterized by a move away from a [[wikt:deficit|deficit]]-oriented towards a more strength-oriented perception, can increasingly be found in management concepts, as well as in the areas of [[continuing education]] and [[self-help]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Definitions==
Robert Adams points to the limitations of any single definition of 'empowerment', and the danger that academic or specialist definitions might take away the word and the connected practices from the very people they are supposed to belong to.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, he offers a minimal definition of the term: 
'Empowerment: the capacity of individuals, groups and/or communities to take control of their circumstances, exercise power and achieve their own goals, and the process by which, individually and collectively, they are able to help themselves and others to maximize the quality of their lives.'&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

One definition for the term is "an intentional, ongoing process centered in the local community, involving mutual respect, critical reflection, caring, and group participation, through which people lacking an equal share of resources gain greater access to and control over those resources".&lt;ref&gt;Cornell Empowerment Group. (1989, October). Empowerment and family support. Networking Bulletin, 1(1)2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, M.A. (2000). Empowerment Theory: Psychological, Organizational and Community Levels of Analysis. "Handbook of Community Psychology," 43–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rappaport's (1984) definition includes: "Empowerment is viewed as a process: the mechanism by which people, organizations, and communities gain mastery over their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, J. (1984). Studies in empowerment: Introduction to the issue. "Prevention in Human Services," 3, 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociological empowerment often addresses members of groups that social discrimination processes have excluded from decision-making processes through – for example – discrimination based on disability, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], ethnicity, religion, or gender. Empowerment as a methodology is also associated with [[feminism]].

==Process==
Empowerment is the process of obtaining basic opportunities for [[marginalized]] people, either directly by those people, or through the help of non-marginalized others who share their own access to these opportunities. It also includes actively thwarting attempts to deny those opportunities. Empowerment also includes encouraging, and developing the skills for, [[self-sufficiency]], with a focus on eliminating the future need for [[Charity (practice)|charity]] or welfare in the individuals of the group. This process can be difficult to start and to implement effectively.

===Strategy===
One empowerment strategy is to assist marginalized people to create their own [[nonprofit organization]], using the rationale that only the marginalized people, themselves, can know what their own people need most, and that control of the organization by outsiders can actually help to further entrench marginalization. Charitable organizations lead from outside of the community, for example, can disempower the community by entrenching a dependence charity or welfare. A nonprofit organization can target strategies that cause structural changes, reducing the need for ongoing dependence. [[Red Cross]], for example, can focus on improving the health of indigenous people, but does not have authority in its charter to install water-delivery and purification systems, even though the lack of such a system profoundly, directly and negatively impacts health. A nonprofit composed of the indigenous people, however, could ensure their own organization does have such authority and could set their own agendas, make their own plans, seek the needed resources, do as much of the work as they can, and take responsibility – and credit – for the success of their projects (or the consequences, should they fail).

The process of which enables individuals/groups to fully access personal or collective power, authority and influence, and to employ that strength when engaging with other people, institutions or society. In other words, "Empowerment is not giving people power, people already have plenty of power, in the wealth of their knowledge and motivation, to do their jobs magnificently. We define empowerment as letting this power out."&lt;ref name=blanchard/&gt;  It encourages people to gain the skills and knowledge that will allow them to overcome obstacles in life or work environment and ultimately, help them develop within themselves or in the society.

To empower a female "...sounds as though we are dismissing or ignoring males, but the truth is, both genders desperately need to be equally empowered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccpa-accp.ca/blog/?p=2273|title=Encouraging and Empowering Girls - Canadian Counselling and Psychotherapy Association|date=13 July 2012|website=Ccpa-accp.ca|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Empowerment occurs through improvement of conditions, standards, events, and a global perspective of life.

===Criticism===
Before there can be the finding that a particular group requires empowerment and that therefore their self-esteem needs to be consolidated on the basis of awareness of their strengths, there needs to be a deficit diagnosis usually carried out by experts assessing the problems of this group. The fundamental asymmetry of the relationship between experts and clients is usually not questioned by empowerment processes. It also needs to be regarded critically, in how far the empowerment approach is really applicable to all patients/clients. It is particularly questionable whether [[mentally ill]] people in acute crisis situations are in a position to make their own decisions. According to Albert Lenz, people behave primarily regressive in acute crisis situations and tend to leave the responsibility to professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Lenz: ''Empowerment und Ressourcenaktivierung – Perspektiven für die psychosoziale Praxis.''&lt;/ref&gt; It must be assumed, therefore, that the implementation of the empowerment concept requires a minimum level of communication and reflectivity of the persons involved.

== In social work and community psychology ==
[[File:Altenheim 12.jpg|thumb|Empowerment in the work for senior citizens in a residential home in Germany]]
In [[social work]], empowerment offers an approach that allows social workers to increase the capacity for self-help of their clients. For example, this allows clients not to be seen as passive, helpless 'victims' to be rescued but instead as a self-empowered person fighting abuse/ oppression; a fight, in which the social worker takes the position of a facilitator, instead of the position of a 'rescuer'.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.12ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marginalized people who lack self-sufficiency become, at a minimum, dependent on charity, or welfare.  They lose their self-confidence because they cannot be fully self-supporting.  The opportunities denied them also deprive them of the pride of accomplishment which others, who have those opportunities, can develop for themselves. This in turn can lead to psychological, social and even mental health problems. "[[Marginalized]]" here refers to the overt or covert trends within societies whereby those perceived as lacking desirable traits or deviating from the group norms tend to be excluded by wider society and ostracized as undesirables.

===In health promotion practice and research===
As a concept, and model of practice, empowerment is also used in health promotion research and practice.
The key principle is for individuals to gain increased control over factors that influence their health status &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.who.int/healthpromotion/about/HPR%20Glossary%201998.pdf|title= Health Promotion Glossary - World Health Organization|website=WHO.int|accessdate=4 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

To empower individuals and to obtain more equity in health, it is also important to address health-related behaviors &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.who.int/healthpromotion/about/HPR%20Glossary%201998.pdf|title= Health Promotion Glossary - World Health Organization|website=WHO.int|accessdate=4 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Studies suggest that health promotion interventions aiming at empowering adolescents should enable active learning activities, use visualizing tools to facilitate self-reflection, and allow the adolescents to influence intervention activities &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holmberg|first=Christopher|last2=Larsson|first2=Christel|last3=Korp|first3=Peter| last4=Lindgren|first4=Eva-Carin|last5=Jonsson|first5=Linus|last6=Fröberg|first6=Andreas|last7=Chaplin|first7=John E.|last8=Berg|first8=Christina|date=2018-07-04|title=Empowering aspects for healthy food and physical activity habits: adolescents’ experiences of a school-based intervention in a disadvantaged urban community|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17482631.2018.1487759|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health and Well-being|volume=13|issue=sup 1|doi=10.1080/17482631.2018.1487759|}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==In economics==
According to Robert Adams, there is a long tradition in the UK and the USA respectively to advance forms of self-help that have developed and contributed to more recent concepts of empowerment. For example, the free enterprise economic theories of [[Milton Friedman]] embraced self-help as a respectable contributor to the economy. Both the Republicans in the US and the Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] built on these theories. 'At the same time, the mutual aid aspects of the concept of self-help retained some currency with socialists and democrats.'&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.7-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economic development]], the empowerment approach focuses on mobilizing the [[self-help]] efforts of the poor, rather than providing them with [[social welfare]]. Economic empowerment is also the empowering of previously disadvantaged sections of the population, for example, in many previously colonized African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microempowering.org |title=Welcome to MicroEmpowering! |publisher=Microempowering.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increasingly engaged corporate directors===
The [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] has argued that large [[institutional investor]]s such as [[pension fund]]s and [[Financial endowment|endowment]]s are exercising a greater influence on the process of adding and replacing corporate directors – as they are themselves steered to do so by their own board members (pension trustees).

This could eventually put more pressure on the [[CEO]]s of [[public company|publicly listed companies]], as “more than ever before, many [North American], UK and European Union [[trustee|pension trustees]] speak enthusiastically about flexing their [[fiduciary]] muscles for the UN’s [[Sustainable Development Goals]]”, and other [[Environmental, social and corporate governance|ESG-centric]] investment practices &lt;ref name="pensions-expert1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal==
Legal empowerment happens when marginalised people or groups use the [[legal mobilisation]] i.e., law, legal systems and justice mechanisms to improve or transform their social, political or economic situations. Legal empowerment approaches are interested in understanding how they can use the [[law]] to advance interests and priorities of the marginalised.&lt;ref name=odi&gt;{{cite web|title=The politics of legal empowerment: legal mobilisation strategies and implications for development|url=http://www.odi.org/publications/8485-legal-empowerment-mobilisation|website=Odi.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 'Open society foundations' (an NGO)  "Legal empowerment is about [[Capacity building|strengthening the capacity]] of all people to exercise their [[rights]], either as individuals or as members of a community. Legal empowerment is about grass root justice, about ensuring that [[law]] is not confined to books or courtrooms, but rather is available and meaningful to ordinary people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/projects/legal-empowerment|title=What Is Legal Empowerment?|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorenzo Cotula in his book ' ''Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control'' ' outlines the fact that [[Law|legal tools]] for securing local resource rights are enshrined in legal system, does not necessarily mean that local resource users are in position to use them and benefit from them. The [[legal system|state legal system]] is constrained by a range of different factors – from lack of resources to cultural issues. Among these factors economic, geographic, linguistic and other constraints on access to courts, ''lack of [[legal awareness]] as well as [[legal aid|legal assistance]] '' tend to be recurrent problems.&lt;ref name=Cotula&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotula|first1=Lorenzo|title=Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control: Securing Local Resource Rights Within Foreign Investment Projects in Africa|date=1 Jan 2007|publisher=IIED, 2007|isbn=9781843696674|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-72KOAj92UgC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=legal%20awareness&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q=legal%20awareness&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many context, marginalised groups do not trust the legal system owing to the widespread manipulation that it has historically been subjected to by the more powerful. 'To what extent one knows the [[law]], and make it work for themselves with 'para legal tools',  is legal empowerment; assisted utilizing innovative approaches like [[legal literacy]] and awareness training, broadcasting [[legal information]], conducting participatory [[legal discourse]]s, supporting local resource user in negotiating with other agencies and stake holders and to strategies combining use of [[Legal proceeding|legal processes]] with [[advocacy]] along with media engagement, and socio [[legal mobilisation]].&lt;ref name=Cotula /&gt;

Sometimes groups are marginalized by society at large, with governments participating in the process of marginalization. [[Equal opportunity]] laws which actively oppose such marginalization, are supposed to allow empowerment to occur. These laws made it illegal to restrict access to schools and public places based on race. They can also be seen as a symptom of minorities' and [[women's empowerment]] through lobbying.

==Gender==
{{main|Gender empowerment|Women empowerment}}
[[Gender empowerment]] conventionally refers to the [[Women empowerment|empowerment of women]], which is a significant topic of discussion in regards to development and economics nowadays. It also points to approaches regarding other marginalized [[genders]] in a particular political or social context. This approach to empowerment is partly informed by [[feminism]] and employed legal empowerment by building on international [[human rights]]. Empowerment is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing [[human rights]] and [[International development|development]]. [[Capability Approach|The Human Development and Capabilities Approach]], [[The Millennium Development Goals]], and other credible approaches/goals point to empowerment and participation as a necessary step if a country is to overcome the obstacles associated with poverty and development.&lt;ref&gt;U.N. General Assembly, 55th Session. “United Nations Millennium Declaration.” (A/55/L.2).  8 September 2000. (Online) Available: www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf (accessed January 2, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sustainable Development Goals|UN Sustainable Development Goals]] targets gender equality and women's empowerment for the global development agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/|title=United Nations: Gender equality and women's empowerment|website=Un.org|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In workplace management==
According to Thomas A. Potterfield,&lt;ref&gt;Potterfield, Thomas. "The Business of Employee Empowerment: Democracy and Ideology in the Workplace." Quorum Books, 1999, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; many organizational theorists and practitioners regard employee empowerment as one of the most important and popular [[Management fad|management concepts]] of our time.

Ciulla discusses an inverse case: that of [[Counterfeit|bogus]] empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Ciulla| first = Joanne B.| chapter = Leadership and the Problem of Bogus Empowerment| editor-last = Ciulla| editor-first = Joanne B.| title = Ethics, the heart of leadership| edition = 2| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| publication-date = 2004| isbn = 978-0-275-98248-5| quote = [...] in many organizations, promises of empowerment are bogus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In management===
In the sphere of [[management]] and organizational theory, "empowerment" often refers loosely to processes for giving subordinates (or [[worker]]s generally) greater discretion and resources: distributing control in order to better serve both customers and the interests of employing organizations.

One account of the history of workplace empowerment in the [[United States of America|United States]] recalls the clash of management styles in railroad construction in the [[American West]] in the mid-19th century, where "traditional" hierarchical East-Coast models of control encountered individualistic pioneer workers, strongly supplemented by methods of [[efficiency]]-oriented "worker [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]]" brought to the scene by [[Chinese American|Chinese]] [[coolie|laborer]]s. In this case, empowerment at the level of work [[team]]s or brigades achieved a notable (but short-lived) demonstrated superiority. See the [http://www.motivation-tools.com/workplace/history.htm views] of Robert L. Webb.

Since the 1980s and 1990s, empowerment has become a point of interest in management concepts and business administration. In this context, empowerment involves approaches that promise greater participation and integration to the employee in order to cope with their tasks as independently as possible and responsibly can. A strength-based approach known as "empowerment circle" has become an instrument of organizational development. Multidisciplinary empowerment teams aim for the development of [[quality circles]] to improve the organizational culture, strengthening the motivation and the skills of employees. The target of subjective job satisfaction of employees is pursued through flat hierarchies, participation in decisions, opening of creative effort, a positive, appreciative team culture, self-evaluation, taking responsibility (for results), more self-determination and constant further learning. The optimal use of existing potential and abilities can supposedly be better reached by satisfied and active workers. Here, [[knowledge management]] contributes significantly to implement employee participation as a guiding principle, for example through the creation of [[communities of practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/2010/04/empowering-your-employees-to-e|title=Empowering Your Employees to Empower Themselves |publisher=hbr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is important to ensure that the individual employee has the skills to meet their allocated responsibilities and that the company's structure sets up the right incentives for employees to reward their taking responsibilities. Otherwise there is a danger of being overwhelmed or even becoming lethargic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/1998/05/empowerment-the-emperors-new-clothes|title=Empowerment: The Emperor’s New Clothes |publisher=hbr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications for company culture===
Empowerment of employees requires a culture of trust in the organization and an appropriate information and communication system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.atulhost.com/employee-empowerment|title=Employee Empowerment: The Key to Employee Satisfaction|publisher=AtulHost}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of these activities is to save control costs, that become redundant when employees act independently and in a self-motivated fashion. 
In the book ''Empowerment Takes More Than a Minute'', the authors illustrate three keys that organizations can use to open the knowledge, experience, and motivation power that people already have.&lt;ref name=blanchard/&gt; The three keys that managers must use to empower their employees are:
# [[information sharing|Share information]] with everyone
# Create [[autonomy]] through boundaries
# Replace the old hierarchy with [[self-directed work team]]s

According to Stewart, in order to guarantee a successful work environment, managers need to exercise the "right kind of [[authority]]" (p.&amp;nbsp;6).  To summarize, "empowerment is simply the effective use of a manager’s authority", and subsequently, it is a productive way to maximize all-around work [[efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Aileen Mitchell. ''Empowering People'' (Institute of Management). Pitman. London: Financial Times Management, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

These keys are hard to put into place and it is a journey to achieve empowerment in a workplace.  It is important to [[workplace training|train]] employees and make sure they have trust in what empowerment will bring to a company.&lt;ref name=blanchard&gt;{{cite book|author1=Blanchard, Kenneth H.|author2=John P. Carlos|author3=Alan Randolph|title=Empowerment Takes More than a Minute|publisher=San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation of the concept of empowerment in management has also been criticised for failing to live up to its claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/2015/05/6-myths-about-empowering-employees|title=6 Myths About Empowering Employees |publisher=hbr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Age of Popular Empowerment?==

[[Marshall McLuhan]] insisted that the development of [[electronic media]] would eventually weaken the [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] structures that underpin central governments, large corporation, academia and, more generally, rigid, “[[Descartes|linear-Cartsesian”]] forms of social organization.&lt;ref name="youtube1977"&gt;{{cite news|last1= McLuhan|first1=Marshall|title=‘ABC TV Monday Conference: The Medium is the Message (Part 1)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImaH51F4HBw|accessdate=28 April 2018|work= ABC TV Monday Conference|publisher=ABC TV Monday Conference|date=27 June 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
From that perspective, new, “electronic forms of awareness” driven by [[information technology]] would empower citizen, employees and students by disseminating in [[real-time computing|near-real-time]] vast amounts of information once reserved to a small number of experts and specialists. Citizens would be bound to ask for substantially more say in the management of government affairs, production, consumption, and education &lt;ref name="youtube1977"/&gt;

[[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] economist Nicolas Firzli has argued that rapidly rising cultural tides, notably new forms of online engagement and increased demands for [[Environmental, social and corporate governance|ESG-driven]] public policies and managerial decisions are transforming the way governments and corporation interact with citizen-consumers in the “Age of Empowerment” &lt;ref name="pensions-expert1"/&gt;

"Used with care, an [[analogy]] is a form of scientific model that can be used to analyze and explain the behavior of other phenomena."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Future Ready: How to Master Business Forecasting |isbn=978-0-470-74705-6 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some experts, research has shown that the careful application of analogies improves the accuracy of the forecast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://qbox.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/mktg/research/INTFOR3581%20-%20Publication%2015.pdf | title = Structured analogies for forecasting | author = Kesten C.

'''Ivane Bagration of Mukhrani''' ({{Lang-ka|ივანე მუხრანბატონი}}, ''Ivane Mukhranbatoni''; {{lang-ru|link=no|Иван Константинович Багратион-Мухранский}}, ''Ivan Konstantinovich Bagration-Mukhransky'') (February 7, 1812 – March 11, 1895) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] nobleman of the [[House of Mukhrani]], and general in the [[Imperial Russia]]n service. He was one of the biggest Georgian landowners of that time and a modernizer of winemaking industry.

==Biography==
Born into a prominent aristocratic family of [[Constantine IV, Prince of Mukhrani]] and Princess Khoreshan née [[Guramishvili]], Ivan Bagration was educated at [[St. Petersburg]] [[Page Corps]] and enlisted in the [[Nizhny Novgorod]] [[Dragoon]] Regiment in 1830. He participated in several expeditions against the rebellious mountaineers during the [[Caucasus War]]. In 1848, he was promoted to colonel and appointed commander of the Erivan [[Grenadier]] Regiment of the Russian Imperial Army located in Manglisi, Tiflis region. He became [[major-general]] in 1851 and scored his most notable achievements during the [[Crimean War]] (1853–1856), when Bagration, being in command of the Caucasian Reserve Grenadier Brigade, played a decisive role in the defeat of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army at Basgedikler (near [[Kars]]) on November 19, 1853. For the rest of the war, he served as a [[governor-general]] of [[Kutaisi]] and defended its approaches from the invading Ottoman troops. Promoted to [[lieutenant-general]], he was put in charge of the 18th Infantry Division in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://george-orden.nm.ru/Port/sbagrationmuhranski_ik.html Иван Константинович Багратион-Мухранский], a biography from Военная энциклопедия Сытина (''[[Sytin]]’s Military Encyclopedia''). Retrieved on 2005-05-25.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Prince Bagration of Mukhrani married, in 1836, Princess Nino (1816–1886), daughter of [[Levan V Dadiani]], [[Principality of Mingrelia|Prince of Mingrelia]], by whom he had the only son, [[Konstantine Bagration of Mukhrani (1895–1903)|Constantine]].

==Later life and winemaking==
Prince Bagration of Mukhrani resigned from military service in 1881 and was elected a [[Marshal of Nobility (Russia)|Marshal of the Nobility]] of [[Tiflis Governorate]] from 1885 to 1891. He owned some 25,000 ''[[dessiatin]]'' of lands and took a big interest in winemaking. He employed French and Georgian specialists to construct, in 1876, a large winery in his familial estate of [[Mukhrani (village)|Mukhrani]] which exploited a French technology of bottling to produce [[Georgian wine|Georgian]] [[sparkling wine]]s. This brand, a winner of a Grand Prix at the 1882 St. Petersburg wine exhibition, is still produced by [[Joint stock company|JSC]] "Bagrationi-1882", one of Georgia’s largest wine-producing enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bagrationi.ge/eng/company/index.html Bagrationi-1882: About Company]. Retrieved on 2005-05-25.&lt;/ref&gt; In Paris (1889) wine exhibition - "Exposition Universalle Internationale De 1889", Mukhranian sparkling wine got gold medal. 
In 2001, a business group founded the Chateau Mukhrani Company which intends to revive the estate to its former glory and re-establish production at Mukhrani, combining modern and traditional technologies, following in the footsteps of Prince Ivane Mukhranbatoni.

'''Jehan Boinebroke''' († 1286 in Douai) was a French merchant from [[Douai]], and 'undoubtedly the most famous merchant-draper "capitalist" to be found in medieval western Europe'.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Munro, 'Medieval Woollens: Textiles, Textile Technology and Industrial Organisation, ''c''. 800-1500', in ''The Cambridge History of Western Textiles, Volume 1'', ed. by D. T. Jenkins (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), pp. 181-227 (219).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Boinebroke was nine times alderman (''échevin'') of his city and accumulated in the course of his life a considerable fortune. He had [[The medieval English wool trade|wool imported from England]] to Douai and had peasant women spin it into yarn. He also developed a dying factory. He made his workers live in its houses at inflated rents. Already in 1245 he faced a riot by artisans and workers in Douai. In 1280 there was again unrest, which extended from Ypres to Tournai and Douai, but in Douai Boinebroke overcame the rebellion.

In his will Boinebroke decreed that the executor should first pay his debts and make up for all the wrong caused by him before his property should go to his four children. When he died in 1286 at Douai, published numerous individuals that submitted their complaints. The complaints grew into a 5.5 m long parchment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ukw7guxYBxcC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;dq=jehan+boinebroke&amp;source=web&amp;ots=_s6vTbGoXM&amp;sig=qYagR3RR1ehO1zDY60vkinq3PwQ#PPA178,M1 Edith Ennen: Die europäische Stadt des Mittelalters. O. O. 1987, p. 178].&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians, in the tradition of [[Karl Marx]], have often viewed Boinebroke's business activity as an early example [[Capitalism|capitalist exploitation]] of his workers. However, in the assessment of John H. Munro,
:he was no 'industrial capitalist', a term that is clearly an anachronism for this era. He was instead principally a wool merchant, dealing in English and domestic wools, and his role as a cloth merchant was only secondary ... he owned land, with many properties in Douia itself and a sheep farm outside. As a merchant, he provided wool on credit to industrial drapers, who pledged their cloths, looms and sometimes even their home as security; and some of them also rented their houses from him. But most of his wage-earning employees were those required for the wool trade itself: sorters, beaters, washers and some wool dyers (who worked in his dyehouse). Although Boinebroke did employ a few others in cloth making, chiefly to work some tentering frames that he owned, there is absolutely no evidence that he ever directly supervised the central processes of cloth production.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Munro, 'Medieval Woollens: Textiles, Textile Technology and Industrial Organisation, ''c''. 800-1500', in ''The Cambridge History of Western Textiles, Volume 1'', ed. by D. T. Jenkins (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), pp. 181-227 (219).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johannes Hage''' (1842 – 1923) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] businessman who became a philanthropist and later founder of the [[Nivaagaard]] museum.

He was the son of a brickworks director whose estate and complex at Nivaagaard he inherited in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nivaagaard.dk/samling/om-johannes-hage/?lang=en museum website]&lt;/ref&gt; Under his direction the company prospered by supplying bricks to building projects in Copenhagen. With his wealth Hage subsidized the National Museum ([[Statens Museum for Kunst]]), but in 1908 decided to found his own art gallery, the ''Nivaagaards Malerisamling'', with 150 paintings. He opened it to the public and in 1908 he made up a will in which he bequeathed the entire collection to the state, along with the museum building and a capital of 60,000 Danish marks for maintenance. In 1913 the later director and curator of the National Museum, [[Karl Madsen]], wrote a catalog of his collection.

Retrieved 14 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Pérez Simón has assembled a collection of over 3000 paintings, including works by [[Dalí]], [[Goya]], [[El Greco]], [[Rubens]], [[Van Gogh]] and [[Monet]].&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; In 2010, ''[[Paris Match]]'' described the collection as the largest in private hands in the world.&lt;ref name=paris/&gt;

==Early life and career==
Pérez Simón was just 5 years of age when his family emigrated to Mexico. They were not wealthy. They travelled by sea in third class accommodation for 28 days before eventually arriving in [[Mexico City]] after spending a month in [[Cuba]]. Pérez Simón's father worked in the beverages business and his son educated himself in economics and accountancy. Pérez Simón met [[Carlos Slim]] when they were both young men. They went into business in 1976 as partners in the [[Grupo Carso|Carso Group]] with Pérez Simón taking a minority 30% stake.&lt;ref name=paris/&gt; In May 2014, the firm had a stock market capitalisation of over US$12 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/companies/grupo-carso/ Grupo Carso.] ''Forbes''. Retrieved 14 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art collection==
Pérez Simón's interest in art began as a teenager. He started collecting in his 20s, first prints and cheap Mexican landscape paintings as for some time he and his wife had little money. Today, Pérez Simón's collection includes works from the fourteenth century onwards but he does not enjoy [[contemporary art]], feeling that it is too intellectual and lacks emotion.&lt;ref name=paris/&gt;

The Carso Group has its own collection and museum, and Pérez Simón coordinates with his partner Carlos Slim in order that they do not compete against each other for the same works. Pérez Simón claims never to refuse a request for a loan of one of his pictures.&lt;ref name=paris/&gt;

==''A Victorian Obsession''==
From November 2014 to March 2015,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/subsites/museums/leightonhousemuseum/avictorianobsession.aspx A Victorian Obsession: The Pérez Simón collection at Leighton House Museum.] Leighton House Museum. Retrieved 14 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; fifty paintings owned by Pérez Simón were put on display at London's [[Leighton House Museum]] in the exhibition ''A Victorian Obsession: The Pérez Simón collection''. The permanent collection of the museum was placed in storage to allow the works to be hung throughout the house. The selected works were those of Frederic Leighton and other important British Victorian painters, many of whom Leighton would have known, such as [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]], [[Albert Joseph Moore|Albert Moore]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[John Everett Millais]], [[John William Waterhouse]], [[Edward Poynter]], [[John Melhuish Strudwick]] and [[John William Godward]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/subsites/museums/leightonhousemuseum/avictorianobsession/background.aspx Background.] Leighton House Museum. Retrieved 14 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings were not labelled, in order that they fit in with the decor of the house.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;

As part of the exhibition, Lawrence Alma-Tadema's ''[[The Roses of Heliogabalus]]'' (1888) was exhibited in [[London]] for the first time since Alma-Tadema's memorial exhibition at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/subsites/museums/leightonhousemuseum/avictorianobsession/background/exhibitionhighlights.aspx Exhibition Highlights.] Leighton House Museum. Retrieved 15 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review of the exhibition, [[Waldemar Januszczak]] of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', described the works included as "demented escapism" and Pérez Simón as "Mexico's richest lover of droopy damsels in distress and muscular Greek nymphettes". &lt;ref name=ST&gt;"No way to treat a lady", Waldemar Januszczak, "Culture", ''The Sunday Times'', 23 November 2014, pp. 20&amp;ndash;21.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liberty Accounts''' is an integrated online [[accounting]] and payroll system designed specifically for [[small and medium enterprises]] in the UK. Also described as a [[software as a service]] or SaaS [[cloud computing]] application, Liberty is available to both business owners and accountants.&lt;ref name="Head in the Clouds 2.0"&gt;[http://www.nigellockett.com/?cat=3 Head in the Clouds 2.0], Prof Nigel Lockett FRSA (23 May 2011), retrieved 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For accountancy firms it is available as a co-branded solution, including the firm's own visual identity and availability form their website.&lt;ref name="The beancounter's guide to internet accounting"&gt;[http://www.businesscloud9.com/news_analysis/beancounters-guide-internet-accounting The beancounter's guide to internet accounting], John Stokdyk (20 January 2009), retrieved 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

A second-generation online accounting system, Liberty was developed by Athene Systems Limited, along with Neil Chadwick — former Marketing Director of Easycounting.&lt;ref name="Cloud Accounting's Pioneers: Where are they now?"&gt;[http://www.businesscloud9.com/news_analysis/cloud-accountings-pioneers-where-are-they-now Cloud Accounting's Pioneers: Where are they now?], John Stokdyk (4 December 2008). retrieved 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] (ICAEW), "This independent technology company has been coming up with innovative software solutions for business processes since 1996. Members of the team have worked for [[American Express]], [[Black &amp; Decker]] and [[Ernst &amp; Young]], and they been involved in offering online accounting solutions to accountants since the earliest days of the market."&lt;ref name=Meall&gt;Meall, Lesley (October 2010), ''Online Accounting Software: Chartech Software Product Guide'' p.13. Published by ICAEW.&lt;/ref&gt;

Athene Systems Limited was founded in 1996 by Alan Wright and Paul Taylor, who realised the potential of the internet as a means of collaboration between accountants and their clients. Development work on Liberty Accounts started in 2001, with the initial launch in 2003. Neil Chadwick joined Alan and Paul in 2006.&lt;ref name=Salter&gt;Salter, Kevin. (November 2009), ''ICAEW Accreditation Scheme Financial Accounting Software Evaluation: Athene Systems Limited''  p.4. Published by ICAEW.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2004/05 the system has linked directly to the [[HM Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC) portal for online filing of [[PAYE]] and [[P11D]],&lt;ref name="Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Online — software and online forms"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/efiling/paye/paye_software_forms.htm Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Online — software and online forms], retrieved 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as facilitating IR35 income and expense association with contracts and employees.&lt;ref name=Meall/&gt;

In 2009, Liberty Accounts was accredited by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW).&lt;ref name=Meall/&gt;

== Technical details ==

The Liberty Accounts system uses industry standard Oracle and [[Java (programming language)]] technologies. It delivers [[HTML]] in a cross-platform [[web browser]] environment, hosted in the UK in a secure data centre.&lt;ref name=Salter/&gt;

=== Management tools ===

Liberty Accounts offers different levels of functionality, depending on the skills and training of the user – meaning that both accountants and their clients can work on the same records, at their own level.&lt;ref name="Leaping into cloud-based accounting and finance systems?"&gt;[http://www.fsn.co.uk/channel_sme_accounting/leaping_into_cloud_based_accounting_and_finance_systems Leaping into cloud-based accounting and finance systems?], Lesley Meall (14 February 2011), retrieved 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for closer and more ongoing collaboration between accountants and client businesses. According to accountant Ray Backler, "I work with my clients on a day-to-day basis using the online system and the current financial position of the business is always up-to-date, so it is obvious when additional work is required, and it's easy to make recommendations for additional revenue streams." &lt;ref name="Life on accountancy's online frontier"&gt;[http://www.accountingweb.co.uk/topic/life-accountancys-online-frontier Life on accountancy's online frontier], Lesley Meall (15 June 2009), retrieved 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accountants can set up a separate area within Liberty Accounts where they are able to access to cross-client views and a range of reports, as well as highlight key tasks and event dates. "Global account settings can be enforced (for P11D classification, NIC classification, default VAT rates, and nominal codes for export to statutory accounts packages) from this control area, and the system can be tailored with the help of pre-packaged ‘roles’. These help members of the firm to manage their work efficiently, and make it easy for firms to control (and restrict) the menu options and structure available to clients." &lt;ref name=Meall/&gt;

=== Data and functionality ===

Secure transmission of data for online transactions is via a [[Thawte]] SSL web server certificate. The visual treatment is similar to that found in the [[Windows]] environment, featuring a typical management snapshot, lists of outstanding sales and purchase invoices and the current bank balance. "The Windows-style drop down menus mirror desktop accounting packages...Reports are generated as PDFs almost instantly and displayed automatically. The presentation of reports and the range of report options look very much like [[QuickBooks]], so there's instant familiarity for most accountants." &lt;ref name="Online Software Review: Liberty Accounts"&gt;[http://www.accountingweb.co.uk/topic/technology/online-software-review-liberty-accounts-nigel-harris Online Software Review: Liberty Accounts], by Nigel Harris, retrieved 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Transactions — such as invoices, bank entries or journals — can be posted singly or in batches.&lt;ref name="Online Software Review: Liberty Accounts" /&gt; "Liberty supports the use of foreign currencies for invoices and customer statements (and can automatically calculate and post exchange rate gains and losses) and as well as having built-in stock control and payroll, it is unusual in offering the tools required for P11D compliance (including section 336 claims)...It captures P11D-related information at a transaction level, pulls the figures together on screen and then produces an HMRC approved facsimile of the P11D form, for ‘one click’ electronic filing." &lt;ref name=Meall/&gt;

=== Value Added Tax ===

Liberty was the first online accounting provider to offer [[VAT]] functionality, including transactions such as [[European Union]] acquisitions, and production of the [[European Community]] Sales List (form VAT 101). Standard and cash accounting VAT schemes are supported, as well as flat-rate VAT (calculated on a transaction basis).&lt;ref name=Meall/&gt; According to David Harbron at the Fenchurch Group of commercial and residential property development companies: "When the UK VAT rate rose to 20% in the New Year, [I] knew that Liberty would immediately be updated to reflect the increase, and that the automatic invoices the Fenchurch Group had set up for its tenants would all go out with the correct VAT rate on." &lt;ref name="Leaping into cloud-based accounting and finance systems?"/&gt;

[[Pepsi]], the carbonated [[beverage]], has had many advertising spokespersons over the years. [[PepsiCo]]'s other drink brands, including [[Mountain Dew]] and [[Gatorade]], also have a variety of famous spokespersons.

==History==
Celebrities have been paid to advertise for Pepsi products.

===United States===
[[Joan Crawford]] was married to PepsiCo president [[Alfred Steele]] from 1955 to 1959 (his death), and was advertising executive and board of directors member from 1959 to 1973.

During the 1960s, [[Joanie Sommers]] sang two popular commercial songs ("It's Pepsi, for those who think young" and "Now you see it, now you don't, oh, Diet Pepsi") for Pepsi-Cola that were run in commercials and for which she came to be often referred to as "The Pepsi Girl"
in 1974 Joseph Nicoletti, then of Brooklyn N.Y. now music-film consultant, Laguna Beach, California, sung and produced the theme "You're Drinking Diet Pepsi and it Shows." Hal Linden (Barney Miller) did the voice over and it was a BBD&amp;O hit Commercial. Nicoletti was signed by legendary ad man Phil Dusenberry. Inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame, Dusenberry wrote the script "The Natural." Dusenberry said Nicoletti was one of the best singing Voices in the business.

In 1984, [[Michael Jackson]] signed a contract with Pepsi that produced many commercials and world tours through 1993.

During the 1989 Grammy Awards telecast, Pepsi and Puerto Rican singer [[Chayanne]] was featured in the first advertising spot in Spanish to be broadcast on national television without dubbing or subtitles.

In the early 1990s, [[Ray Charles]] was the star of a [[Diet Pepsi]] campaign called "[[You Got the Right One, Baby]]," which was also known as "Uh-huh."

During the late 1990s the [[Spice Girls]] became the face of Pepsi with the tagline “Generation Next” inspired by their song [[Move Over]] from their album ''[[Spiceworld (album)|Spiceworld]]''. Promotion included TV commercials, CD singles for the promo single "Step to Me", and collectible cans and glasses with each Spice Girl on a different can or cup.

In 2001, [[Britney Spears]] became a spokesperson for Pepsi. During her contract Spears did many commercials including ones for the World Cup and other major events. Spears' contract concluded with an advertisement with Pink, [[Beyoncé Knowles]], and [[Enrique Iglesias]]. The ad was made featuring the cover of the song "[[We Will Rock You]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] set in a Roman gladiator arena.

In 2004, Beyoncé, [[Jennifer Lopez]], and [[David Beckham]] all starred in a commercial for the brand together, featuring the two singers as assassin-like characters. 

In 2005, [[Christina Aguilera]] was signed to promote the popular drink (she was previously promoting Coca-Cola in 2000).  The campaign featuring Aguilera was released in 2006, but not in the United States.  Some commercials featured singer Elissa, and some with Aguilera by herself. PepsiCo said in a recent interview that Christina Aguilera has that 'dare for more' approach. [[Aretha Franklin]] was also a spokesperson in 1998. And also in 1999 [[Janet Jackson]] signed on to the original "Ask For More" campaign which featured a song of the same name written and sung by Jackson.

In 2006, PepsiCo and Motorola launched the "Cool Tones" campaign. It involved [[Mariah Carey]], [[Mary J. Blige]] and [[The All American Rejects]] writing and performing ringtones that could be obtained by purchasing a Pepsi bottle. The artists also filmed commercials for the campaign in which they perform their original ringtones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/2605/introducing_ringtone_music_videos/news/ |title=Introducing … Ringtone Music Videos! |publisher=[[Stereogum]] |date=2006-05-15 |accessdate=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-original-ringtones-by-mariah-carey-mary-j-blige-and-the-all-american-rejects-now-available-exclusively-through-the-pepsi-cool-tones--motorola-phones-promotion-56349032.html |title=New Original Ringtones by Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige and The All-American Rejects Now Available |website=Prnewswire.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Beyoncé was signed to promote Pepsi once again. This campaign will be her fifth for the soft drink since 2002 — and her face will be on a limited-edition line of soda cans. The multiyear campaign is estimated at $50 million, the bulk of it for media placements and promotions around the world, and the remainder split roughly equally between Beyoncé’s fee and what Pepsi calls a creative content development fund.

[[Nicki Minaj]] signed a promotional deal with Pepsi in February 2012. A commercial was released which includes her hit single, "[[Moment 4 Life]]", on Sunday, May 6 at approximately 6:06 pm.

[[NASCAR]] driver [[Jeff Gordon]] is a spokesperson for Pepsi, and was sponsored by the company starting in 1997 as an associate sponsor, and sponsored Gordon in the [[Nationwide Series|Busch Series]] for two seasons. Since 2001, Pepsi has served as sponsor for Gordon in at least two races per season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gordonline.com/sponsors.html|title=Jeff Gordon's Sponsors|work=Gordonline.com|accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[New Orleans Saints]] quarterback [[Drew Brees]] and musical group [[One Direction]] co-starred in a Pepsi commercial.

In 2017, model and television personality [[Kendall Jenner]] starred in a commercial premiering the week of April 1 which caused much controversy over social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/04/pepsi-ad-internet-response/|title=Pepsi’s New Kendall Jenner Ad Was So Bad It Actually United the Internet|last=Watercutter|first=Angela|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe and the United Kingdom===
For the 1988 and 1989 seasons, Pepsi was the title sponsor of Suzuki's effort in motorcycle road racing's premier class, Grand Prix 500cc. The Pepsi livery was a new addition to grand prix motorcycling, and a change from tobacco sponsors.

During 1988-9, [[Suzuki]] also produced a number of road going replicas of the GP bikes, emblazoned with the same Pepsi signage as the works bikes. Due to the livery's association with one of Suzuki's riders, the Texan, Kevin Schwantz, riders today are still producing their own replicas as tribute.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}&lt;!---this is awful. Needs rewording at best. Deletion would be better---&gt;

In 1998, the group [[Spice Girls]] have been spokeswomen in the international campaign. The ad was featuring the song "[[Move Over|Move Over (Generation Next)]]".

Since 2001, [[Sakis Rouvas]] has been a spokesperson in the [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Balkan]] campaign under contract with the headquarters of [[United Kingdom]], being the only Greek artist to have ever been proposed to represent the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mad.tv/news/?id=3509|script-title=el:Σόκαρε ο Σάκης!|publisher=''[[MAD TV (Greece)|MAD TV]]''|accessdate=2009-01-30|language=Greek|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/665CuZo8x?url=http://www.mad.tv/news/?id=3509|archivedate=2012-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since summer 2009, [[Inna]] is the spokeswoman in [[Romania]], [[Moldova]] and secondly in [[Bulgaria]], [[Hungary]] and [[Serbia]]. She promoted Pepsi mostly in Romania, Moldova and Bulgaria through TV commercials and internet adverts. Some commercials have been translated from Romanian into Bulgarian or even Hungarian.

===Latin America===
In Latin America, [[Colombian people|Colombian]] artists [[Shakira]], and [[Juanes]]; [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] [[Sammy Sosa]], and [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[Daddy Yankee]] have promoted the soft drink. Spanish-speaking [[Jaci Velasquez]] did some commercials. In 2007 [[RBD]] promoted the drink in their home country of [[Mexico]].

===Asia===
As for Asia, celebrity and singers [[Show Lo]], [[Leslie Cheung]], [[Jay Chou]], [[Aaron Kwok]], [[Jolin Tsai]], [[Rain (entertainer)|Rain]], [[Louis Koo]], [[Nicholas Tse]], [[F4 (band)|F4]], [[Faye Wong]], [[Kelly Chen|Kelly Chan]], [[Momo Wu]], [[Bamboo Mañalac]], [[Jericho Rosales]], [[Jackson Wang]], [[Daniel Padilla]] and [[Julia Barretto]] have appeared in several different advertisements.

In [[Pakistan]],  Pepsi sponsors the [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan cricket team]] and many Pakistani celebrities and personalities have been spokespersons for the brand including [[Hadiqa Kiani]], [[Junaid Jamshed]], [[Shoaib Akhtar]], [[Bob Woolmer]], [[Younus Khan]], [[Kamran Akmal]], [[Adnan Sami]],  [[Reema Khan]], [[Call (Pakistani band)|Call]], and [[Vital Signs (pop band)|Vital Signs]].

In India, Pepsi first used [[Aamir Khan]], model turned actress [[Mahima Chaudhary]] and model and ex-Miss World [[Aishwariya Rai]] to promote its product. Later it used [[Amitabh Bachchan]], [[Shahrukh Khan]], [[Kajol]], [[Rani Mukherjee]],  [[Saif Ali Khan]], [[Fardeen Khan]], [[Akshay Kumar]], [[Shahid Kapoor]] (before he entered the movie world), [[Preity Zinta]], [[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]], [[Pawan Kalyan]], [[Ram Charan Teja]], [[Priyanka Chopra]], and [[Kareena Kapoor]] as well as the national [[cricket]] team. Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone were signed for Pepsi's Youngistan campaign which targeted the youth.

===Australia===
In Australia, the trend has been to use local Australian celebrities to promote Pepsi including [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Jennifer Hawkins]] (Miss Universe 2004), [[Holly Valance]], [[Harry Kewell]], [[Delta Goodrem]], [[Mark Philippoussis]] and several others including New Zealander [[Sonny Bill Williams]]

== Troubled endorsers ==
Pepsi has had a notorious association with spokespersons, primarily popstars, over the last 25 years.

* The first international popstar to become a spokesperson for the drink was [[Michael Jackson]], who along with his brothers ([[The Jackson 5]]) advertised Pepsi for "the new generation" in an advertisement featuring a reworking of his song "[[Billie Jean]]". However, when filming a second advertisement in 1984, a pyrotechnics stunt went wrong and badly burnt Jackson.
* In 1987, [[David Bowie]] and [[Tina Turner]] joined forces to advertise the soft drink, in an advertisement featuring a reworking of Bowie's hit "[[Modern Love (song)|Modern Love]]." The company also agreed to sponsor Bowie's 1987 Glass Spider World Tour. Bowie was accused of sexual assault shortly afterwards, and the company dropped the advertisements immediately. Two years later, Pepsi's attempts to make [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] a new Pepsi spokesperson ended with the infamous "[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]" incident when Madonna's video brought charges of [[anti-Catholicism]] to the company.
* In August 2002, Pepsi pulled a national, 30-second commercial featuring multiplatinum rapper [[Ludacris]] from the air after Fox's [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] called for a boycott of the soft drink company. O'Reilly characterized Pepsi as "immoral" for using the rapper, whom he described as a "rap thug." O'Reilly referenced several of Ludacris's lyrics, which he said emphasized a lifestyle that included getting intoxicated, selling drugs, fighting people, and degrading women. The issue resurfaced when Pepsi began to run ads with [[The Osbournes]], a move that [[Russell Simmons]], head of the Hip Hop Summit Action Network categorized as racially insensitive. The company maintained that Ludacris was an inappropriate spokesman because of his usage of language, but Simmons and the HHSAN contended that the Osbournes use of language was just as unacceptable. The final accord reached between the two parties had Pepsi make an annual contribution of $1 million to the Ludacris Foundation (an organization that helps middle and high school students motivate themselves in creative arts) for three years. In addition, the HHSAN helped Pepsi find other community-based organizations to support. Simmons made it clear that he would not accept any money for any charitable organization that he was involved in. While Pepsi offered to shoot a new series of ads on hip-hop history with Ludacris, the rapper declined and additionally stated through Simmons that he did not want his previous ads to re-air.
* According to allhiphop.com, in 2005, a rumor spread that the newest spokesperson for Pepsi, [[Kanye West]], was dropped after a comment made against President [[George W. Bush]]. Nicole Bradley, public relations manager of Pepsi, clarified that the company's relationship with West had not changed and their marketing will continue as planned.

'''Luca Alessandro Longobardi''' (born 1969) is an Italian entrepreneur, a former venture capitalist and investment banker. He gained attention for being wrongfully arrested and spending a month in prison in Brazil, during which period he became known as "the [[Italian mafia|mafia]]'s banker".

His first foray into hospitality and experience in finance is soon to culminate in a members’ club powered by blockchain, Home Noir. 

==Biography==
A native of [[Naples]], Longobardi left home for [[New York City]] with [[United States dollar|$]]500 at the age of 21 to begin his career.&lt;ref name="lastampa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="standard"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/restaurants/former-alleged-mafia-conspirator-opens-notting-hill-restaurant-a3442726.html |title=Former alleged Mafia conspirator opens Notting Hill restaurant |date=17 January 2017 |author=David Ellis |work=[[London Evening Standard]] |accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sold shirts in the streets and even spent nights sleeping in [[Grand Central Station]] before taking up a job at VTR Capital, a satellite operation of the notorious, now-defunct investment bank [[Stratton Oakmont]], founded by [[Jordan Belfort]]. He then worked at [[Ladenburg Thalmann]], another investment bank,&lt;ref name="vanityfair"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Oltre il buio dell'ala bianca |language=Italian |date=25 November 2015 |first=Riccardo |last=Romani |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |issue=46 |pages=125–126 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before founding his own investment banking group State Capital in 1999, opening offices in Italy, [[Miami]], New York and [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name="ilsecoloxix" /&gt;

In August 2010 Longobardi went to the United States consulate in [[São Paulo]] to renew his American [[Visa (document)|visa]]. After the consulate's computer system identified him as a fugitive issued with a [[Interpol notice|Red Notice]] from [[Interpol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zh.clicrbs.com.br/rs/noticias/noticia/2010/08/italiano-preso-por-vinculo-com-mafia-atuava-no-rs-3018740.html |title=Italiano preso por vínculo com máfia atuava no RS |language=Portuguese |date=26 August 2010 |author=Humberto Trezzi |publisher=ZH Notícias |accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was arrested by an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent and a Brazilian policeman, who accused him of [[money laundering|laundering money]] for the [[Italian mafia]];&lt;ref name="vanityfair" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.standard.co.uk/business/confessions-from-the-city-luca-longobardi-the-mafias-banker-a3598591.html&lt;/ref&gt; he later became known in the press as "the mafia's banker".&lt;ref name="italiaoggi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lastampa" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdbnews.com/single-post/2015/11/28/Luca-Longobardi-solo-un-ex-banchiere |title=Luca Longobardi: solo un ex banchiere |language=Italian |date=28 November 2015 |author=Ebrahim Maceria |work=CDB News |accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While awaiting extradition to Italy, he was placed in a maximum security prison along with notorious criminals such as Colombian drug lord Pablo Rayo Montaño and Italian terrorist Pierluigi Bragaglia. He was cleared of all charges and released in September 2010 after it emerged that there was no reference to the [[Camorra]] in any of Longobardi's case files.&lt;ref name="ilsecoloxix"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ilsecoloxix.it/p/cultura/2016/02/07/ASaqUDUB-diventa_storia_banchiere.shtml |title='Ero il banchiere dei clan', la storia diventa un film |language=Italian |date=7 February 2016 |author=Fabio Pozzo |work=[[Il Secolo XIX]] |accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longobardi was an early adopter of cryptocurrency and used [[Bitcoin]] as a means to pay the lawyer who secured his release. He realised its value and the potential of the supporting technology, [[blockchain]], almost from inception.

In 2015, Longobardi published a book entitled ''Branded "The Mafia's Banker"'' ({{lang-it|Per tutti ero il banchiere dei clan}}) documenting his experience during his arrest and time in prison.&lt;ref name="lastampa" /&gt; A video promoting the book was released on [[YouTube]] on 22 October 2015, reaching over 1 million views and winning the Best Trailer/Promos award for May 2016 at the [[Los Angeles Independent Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kr58fN5Hc |title=BRANDED "THE MAFIA'S BANKER" |date=22 October 2015 |publisher=Luca Longobardi / [[YouTube]] |accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laiffawards.com/may-2016-winner.html |title=May 2016 Winner |publisher=[[Los Angeles Independent Film Festival]] |accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, Longobardi's film ''An Italian Food Story'' won the Best Inspirational Film award at the Los Angeles Film Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lafilmawards.net/december2016 |title=Winners - December 2016 |publisher=Los Angeles Film Awards |accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longobardi’s next venture, Home Noir, will combine his experience in finance, blockchain and hospitality. A members’ club existing physically and digitally with its own currency, Home Noir intends to unleash the power of the collaborative community, empowering progressive minds through blockchain. Later this year Home Noir will fundraise with the launch of an ICO ([[Initial coin offering|Initial Coin Offering]]). Participants can purchase Noir tokens in exchange for Bitcoin or Ethereum. 

==Personal life==

'''Maurice Coleman Davies''' (24 September 1835 – 10 May 1913) was a [[timber]] miller in the early [[history of Western Australia]].  He created the '''M.C.Davies Karri and Jarrah Timber Company''', a timber empire that employed hundreds of men, laid over a hundred kilometres of private railway, and even built its own private ports for exporting of timber.

==Early years==
Maurice Coleman Davies was born in [[London]] on 24 September 1835.  His family migrated to [[Australia]] when he was about five years old, and settled in southern [[Tasmania]] as farmers.  In 1847, the family moved to [[New Norfolk]], where Davies' father found work as a shopkeeper.  In 1851 the Davies family joined the [[gold rush]] to the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] gold fields.

M. C. Davies moved to [[South Australia]] in 1856, establishing himself as a supplier of building materials.  His venture was a financial success, and by 1867 he was operating as a general commission agent and merchant in [[Adelaide]], specialising in the supply of [[hardwood]] [[timber]] to the [[railway]] and construction industries. He was associated with John Wishart in building a bridge over the [[River Torrens]], then in 1872 was part of Baillie, Davies and Wishart, who successfully [[Call for bids|tendered]] for the construction of the [[Aldgate, South Australia|Aldgate]] to [[Nairne, South Australia|Nairne]] section of the [[Melbourne–Adelaide rail corridor|Adelaide to Melbourne railway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5404747 |title=The Late Mr. M. C. Davies |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)]] |volume=LV, |issue=17,027 |location=South Australia |date=13 May 1913 |accessdate=22 October 2018 |page=10 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This required a steady supply of quality hardwood, which was scarce in South Australia.  Davies was involved in the difficult task of contracting for timber, and during this time he became interested in the large forests of [[Jarrah]] and [[Karri]] in [[Western Australia]].  In 1875, he migrated to Western Australia, and the following year was granted a licence to cut timber.  He then erected two [[saw mill]]s on the [[Collie River]].  The success of these mills was limited, mainly because of the poor quality of road between the mills and the [[port]] of [[Bunbury, Western Australia|Bunbury]].

==Timber industry==
[[File:M C Davies Karri and Jarrah concessions 1899.jpg|thumb|300px|right|M C Davies timber concessions in 1899]]
From 1877, Davies became increasingly interested in the timber country north of [[Augusta, Western Australia|Augusta]].  This area contained excellent forests of Jarrah and Karri, and there were [[bay]]s nearby where ships could be loaded.  Davies sought a licence to work the area in 1879, but was rejected.  He eventually obtained [[timber rights]] in 1882, and over the following years he consolidated with numerous additional land purchases and licences.  His business prospered, and he built numerous saw mills and over 100 kilometres of [[railway]] line to cart the timber.  Jetties were built to enable loading of ships in [[Hamelin Bay, Western Australia|Hamelin]] and [[Flinders Bay|Flinders]] Bays, and the town of [[Karridale, Western Australia|Karridale]] was established to house the hundreds of workers employed by Davies.  Davies' business became so successful that by 1890 he was responsible for 32% of all timber exported from Western Australia.

By 1894, all six of Davies' sons were involved in Davies' business, and the name of the business was changed from '''M.C.Davies''' to '''M.C.Davies Company Ltd'''.  The business continued to prosper and expand, but the timber markets expanded even more rapidly, and by 1897 the company no longer had the resources to keep pace with market growth.  In that year, Davies went to London to float the business as a [[public company]], under the name '''M.C.Davies Karri and Jarrah Company Ltd'''.

==Amalgamation==
The next five years were difficult for Davies' business.  Many new companies had entered the timber market in Western Australia, and there was fierce competition.  [[South Africa]]n demand for timber had been seriously affected by the [[Second Boer War]], and other overseas markets were flooded with Jarrah and Karri.  In 1902, M.C.Davies Karri and Jarrah Co. Ltd amalgamated with seven other companies to form the [[Millars Karri and Jarrah Forests Limited]], informally known as the ''Millars Combine''.  The main Karridale mill was closed soon after, and by 1913 all of the M.C.Davies Company mills were closed.

Maurice Coleman Davies retired after the formation of the Millers Combine.  He died at his home in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] on 10 May 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article57746256 |title=OBIT: MR. M. C.

'''Michael Fingleton''' is a former chief executive of [[Irish Nationwide Building Society]]. He joined the building society in 1971 and retired in April 2009 as the effects of the [[2008–2012 Irish banking crisis]] became apparent.  He is known as "Fingers" in the banking community.&lt;ref name ="Fingers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2009/0501/1224245756853.html|author=Simon Carswell|title=What lies in store for Irish Nationwide after Fingleton?|publisher=''[[Irish Times]]''|date=01/05/2010|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Michael Fingleton was born in [[Tubbercurry]], [[Co. Sligo]] in 1938, the son of a local [[Garda Síochána|Garda]]. He attended St Nathy's school in [[Ballaghaderreen]], and in later years [[University College Dublin|UCD]], [[Trinity College, Dublin|TCD]] and [[Kings Inns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/michael-fingleton-the-cv-477533.html|title=MICHAEL FINGLETON THE CV|publisher= ''[[Irish Independent]]''|date=22 February 2004|accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended a [[seminary]], but quit before taking his vows.&lt;ref name="Pointing Fingers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2009/02/22/story39728.asp |title=Pointing Fingers |author=Nicola Cooke |publisher=''[[Sunday Business Post]]'' |date=22 February 2009 |accessdate=30 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410043553/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2009/02/22/story39728.asp |archivedate=10 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early Sixties, he joined [[Allied Irish Finance]] and simultaneously began studying commerce. On earning his [[Academic degree|degree]], he went to the [[Dairy Disposal Agency]], a state body that took over defunct creameries in the west of Ireland. During this period, he studied at night to become a [[chartered accountant]].&lt;ref name="Pointing Fingers"/&gt;

Following this, he joined aid agency [[Concern Worldwide|Concern]] and from 1969 he spent a number of years organising food supplies to the [[Republic of Biafra]], the short-lived secessionist state in southeastern [[Nigeria]]. He eventually became chairman of Concern.&lt;ref name="Pointing Fingers" /&gt;

==Career at Irish Nationwide==
In 1971, he became the secretary of the Irish Independent Building Society, founded in 1873. At the time he was not a homeowner. The building society had five employees and assets of €2 million.  In his first year at the helm, the company made a profit of just €12,000 and Fingleton had to wait three years for his first company car.&lt;ref name ="one man" /&gt;

In 1973 he was [[called to the bar]], the same year that [[Dick Spring]], [[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]] and [[Adrian Hardiman]] were also called, although he never practised as a barrister.&lt;ref name= "profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/profile--behind-the-kindly-smile-there-lurks-a-very-shrewd-operator-93213.html|title=PROFILE : Behind the kindly smile there lurks a very shrewd operator|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''|date=17 June 2006|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building society changed its name to Irish Nationwide in 1975&lt;ref name ="Finfacts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1019486.shtml|title=State bailed-out commercial property lender Irish Nationwide reports massive 2009 loss of €2.5bn|publisher=Finfacts Ireland|date=19 April 2010|accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began to expand. The key to its expansion was marketing, using the media to build the profile of the business. The emphasis was on the use of [[Agency (law)|agents]] rather than opening branches. Fingleton built it up into a network of 50 branches and 40 branch agents, helped by the takeover of the [[Garda Building Society]], Irish Mutual and Metropolitan Building Society and enacted a flexible [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] policy in the 1980s.  Fingleton cultivated relationships with the press and benefitted by receiving free [[public relations|publicity]]. Many journalists in the 1980s received mortgages from the Irish Nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1016362.shtml|title=Fingleton to resign from Irish Nationwide Building Society|publisher=Finfacts Ireland|date=02/04/2009|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fingleton always stressed that these were all above board. During the 1980s, when he was at the height of his media profile, he sent journalists a Christmas card portraying himself as [[Santa Claus]].&lt;ref name="The Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2005/05/01/story4378.asp |title=One-man building society |author=Ian Kehoe |publisher=''[[Sunday Business Post]]'' |date=01/05/2005 |accessdate=5 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050521010645/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2005/05/01/story4378.asp |archivedate=21 May 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fingleton drew a salary of €1.3m in 2005, including a €500,000 bonus making his earnings on a par with chief executives of the larger banks.&lt;ref name= "profile" /&gt; He began to look for [[demutualisation]] legislation in 2001 with the change in the law coming through in August 2006. In 2007, after failed talks with Germany's [[HypoVereinsbank]] and [[GE Money]], he almost sold the building society to Iceland's [[Landsbanki]]. Fingleton set Irish Nationwide's asset value close to €1.3 billion to reflect the equity he expected to be released from any deals. Fingleton expected to earn up to €15 million from the deal.&lt;ref name ="one man"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/a-oneman-band-1366187.html|title=a one-man band?|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''|date=03/05/2008|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landsbanki who were initially attracted by Irish Nationwide's deposit book, backed off, unnerved by the level of the society's commercial lending. The Icelandic bank collapsed nine months later.&lt;ref name="Sunday Times" /&gt;

Fingleton had a reputation as an [[Autocracy|autocrat]]&lt;ref name= "profile" /&gt; and effectively ran a one-man lending department with loans of over €500,000 being personally approved by him.&lt;ref name= "The Post" /&gt; In 2002 it emerged that he had an affair with a subordinate who was provided with a £200,000 settlement after she took her case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.&lt;ref name = "Sticky Fingers" /&gt; When Irish Nationwides home loans manager Brian Fitzgibbon sued to stop the building society from sacking him in 2007, it reinforced the impression that Fingleton totally dominated the institution. In his evidence, Fitzgibbon alleged that Fingleton over-ruled his decision not to lend money to rogue solicitors Micheal Lynn and Thomas Byrne to whom the building society loaned over €10m each. Fitzgibbon went on to allege that the Nationwide's lending decisions ''"were entirely informal and controlled by Michael Fingleton"''. Fitzgibbon also stated that many loans issued by the Irish Nationwide had not been approved by its credit committee, which existed only to satisfy the requirements of the [[Central Bank of Ireland]]. Fingleton said the society took "adequate provisions" in 2007 for loans to the rogue solicitors as it booked a total loan loss charge of €48.8m.&lt;ref name="Pointing Fingers" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="one man" /&gt;

By the end of 2007, Irish Nationwide had become a major financial institution with pre-tax profits of €390m for 2006 and gross assets of €16.1bn. He had managed to bring the group's cost-to-income ratio down to 10pc from 14.4pc the previous year.&lt;ref name ="one man" /&gt; The same year, Fingleton transferred a €27.6m pension fund from the society.&lt;ref name="Sunday Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article7094131.ece|title=Avoiding the fall out at Irish Nationwide|author=Aine Coffey|publisher=''[[The Sunday Times]]''|date=11/04/2010|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loans to politicians and other public figures===
As well as arranging loans for journalists, Fingleton arranged loans for other political and public figures.  In December 2009, after interviewing Olivia Greene, a former home loans supervisor at Irish Nationwide, Prime Time reported that former Minister for Finance [[Charlie McCreevy]] was loaned €1.6m for a €1.5m property by Irish Nationwide, when the building society wasn't supposed to be providing 100 per cent loans.  He also provided a loan for [[Celia Larkin]], the ex-partner of former [[taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]], without requiring any proof of income.  John Mara, the son of former [[Fianna Fáil]] director of elections [[PJ Mara]], was also named in court as having drawn down big loans, including a €1.5 million loan for which Fingleton did not seek any additional security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepost.ie/story/eyidqlgbql/ |title=The untouchable and the untenable |author=Kathleen Barrington |publisher=''[[Sunday Business Post]]'' |date=25 April 2010 |accessdate=5 May 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greene also said current Fianna Fáil Senator [[Francis O'Brien]] and former FF Senator [[Don Lydon]] were given fast-track loans of €7m and €3m&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/home/society-launches-loans-to-politicians-inquiry-108460.html#ixzz0n5qxbTUa|title=Society launches loans to politicians inquiry|author=Conor Ryan|publisher=''[[Irish Examiner]]''|date=23 December 2009|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of the economic crisis and retirement===
The performance of the building society [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|crashed in 2008]] as bad loans spiralled. Irish Nationwide made a pretax loss of €280 million for the year, after writing off €464 million on bad loans, a 10-fold increase on the 2007 figure.&lt;ref name ="Fingers" /&gt; The state was eventually forced to inject €2.7 billion into the society to shore up its balance sheet and prevent the collapse of a [[Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008|government-guaranteed]] institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbpost.ie/newsfeatures/the-fall-of-the-house-of-fingleton-48820.html|title=The fall of the house of Fingleton|author=David Clerkin|publisher=''[[Sunday Business Post]]''|date=25 April 2010|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the run-up to the 2008 annual board meeting, with Fingleton approaching 70, when he would be required to retire as a director, the board considered tabling a motion that would permit him to stay on for another two years. The idea was abandoned and Fingleton refused to stay on as the chief executive unless he was paid the same amount as in 2007, when he had received a €1m bonus. At the end of April 2009, Fingleton retired, buffeted by criticism for receiving the €1m "bonus" in 2008.&lt;ref name="Sunday Times" /&gt; He left Irish Nationwide relying on the continued support of the Irish government through the guarantee scheme to raise funding from bond investors to keep the institution in business. Losses from 2009 of €2.5bn&lt;ref name ="Finfacts" /&gt; effectively wiped out all profits made by the society since its inception as Irish Nationwide.&lt;ref name="Sticky Fingers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune.ie/news/article/2010/apr/25/sticky-fingers/ |title=Sticky Fingers |author=Michael Clifford |publisher=''The Tribune'' |date=25 April 2010 |accessdate=02/05/2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430072018/http://www.tribune.ie/news/article/2010/apr/25/sticky-fingers/ |archivedate=30 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fingleton received €221k in pay for the final four months of his employment, up to April 2009. This amount, calculated on an annual basis, exceeded the cap of €500k imposed by the Government for top bankers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emigrant.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=77600|title=Banks and bankers under scrutiny|publisher=''The Irish Emigrant''|date=26/04/10|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the depth of the society's problems became apparent, Fingleton came under public and political pressure to return the €1m bonus. In April 2010 he offered to give it to charity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbpost.ie/breakingnews/ireland/eyojojcwgboj/|title=Fingleton wants to give €1m bonus to charity|publisher=''[[Sunday Business Post]]''|date=25 April 2009|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this proposal was rejected by the Irish government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/business/fingletons-euro1m-to-charity-proposal-rejected-118135.html/|title=Fingleton's €1m to charity proposal rejected|publisher=''[[Irish Examiner]]''|date=26 April 2009|accessdate=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2010 there was no evidence that the money had been returned.

Michael Fingleton is married to his wife, Eileen.  They live in Shankill in South Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/mar/29/fingleton-registered-irish-nationwide-loan-at-age-/ |title=Fingleton registered Irish Nationwide loan at age 68 |publisher=''[[Sunday Tribune]]'' |author=Neil Callanan and Emmet Oliver |date=29 March 2010 |accessdate=30 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403014323/http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/mar/29/fingleton-registered-irish-nationwide-loan-at-age-/ |archivedate=3 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoys [[horse racing]] and frequently attends racing festivals.

'''Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics''' is a book by [[Richard Thaler]], economist and professor at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/business/dealbook/book-review-misbehaving-by-richard-thaler.html|title=In ‘Misbehaving,’ an Economics Professor Isn’t Afraid to Attack His Own|first=Jonathan A.|last=Knee|date=5 May 2015|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He won the Nobel Prize for economics in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2017/press.html|title=Press Release|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book builds on Thaler's work as a Behavioral Economist in trying to present an alternate view point that humans bring along behavioral biases, are error prone, and are not always rational. This view point builds on his work from his previous book, [[Nudge (book)|Nudge]] published in 2008. Thaler ties this to the effect on markets, which are otherwise expected to be efficient. 

Thaler uses the book to talk to readers about how behavioral economic analysis can help look at areas ranging from household finance, to TV shows, NFL drafts and emerging disruptive businesses like Uber, in a new light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Misbehaving.html?id=CorKoQEACAAJ|title=Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics|first=Richard H.|last=Thaler|date=9 October 2017|publisher=W.W.

He is the Chairman of [http://www.americanturkishsociety.org/ The American Turkish Society]. He is the Chairman of The American Turkish Society. He assumed this position in June 2007 after the passing of [[Ahmet Ertegun]], the previous chairman of The Society, a prominent Turkish-American businessman and musician, and the founder of [[Atlantic Records]], in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldmusiccentral.org/2006/12/16/music-legend-philanthropist-and-prominent-liaison-between-the-u-s-and-turkey-dies-at-83/Music Legend, Philanthropist and Prominent Liaison Between the U.S. and Turkey Dies at 83] WorldMusicCentral.org.

==Personal life==
Born in the Karadat Mariam area of Baghdad, Iraq in 1937 to an [[Chaldean Christians|Chaldean]] family, Auchi attended Al Mansoor Primary School and [[Baghdad College|Baghdad College High School]], before going on to study at Baghdad's [[Mustansiriyah University]]. He married his wife Ibtisam in 1963, and together they have 3 daughters and 1 son, born in 1964 and 1972 respectively. In 1979, he and his family fled to London following an extortion attempt by an enforcer for [[Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti]]. Six years later, Auchi's younger brother Naseer was hanged by the Baathist regime after discovering the extent of al-Tikriti's corruption.&lt;ref name="NAF1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nadhmiauchifoundation.org/biography/1937-to-1954 |title=Biographical Timeline |publisher=Nadhmi Auchi Foundation |year=2011 |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auchi became a British citizen in 1989 and currently resides in London.&lt;ref name="AAO" /&gt; He and his wife &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmhsa.com/news2009.html |title=News and Events 2009 |year=2009 |publisher=General Mediterranean Holding |accessdate=25 July 2011 |quote=Ibtisam and I share a common desire to foster greater inter-religious relations with the followers of all faiths and we are both well aware and appreciate the important work of the late Pope John Paul II and the current Pope in fostering such work globally |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820211923/http://www.gmhsa.com/news2009.html |archivedate=20 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nadhmiauchifoundation.org/2010/07/21/qa-with-nadhmi-auchi |title=Q&amp;A with Nadhmi Auchi |publisher=Nadhmi Auchi Foundation |year=2011 |accessdate=25 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711134338/http://www.nadhmiauchifoundation.org/2010/07/21/qa-with-nadhmi-auchi |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; have aimed to promote inter-faith dialogue, unity among Arab states, and to build bridges between the West and the Arab world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nadhmiauchifoundation.org/good-causes |title=Good Causes |publisher=Nadhmi Auchi Foundation |year=2011 |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; through charitable and humanitarian work, for which Auchi has been recognised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=25967481 |title=Nadhmi Auchi: Executive Profile &amp; Biography |publisher=Bloomberg L.P |year=2011 |work=businessweek.com |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://onthescene.blogs.foxnews.com/2008/06/20/10-iraqis-you-should-know/#Nadhm |title=10 Iraqis You Should Know |first=David |last=MacDougall |author2=Ghalib, Tawfiq |publisher=FOX News Network |date=20 June 2008 |work=foxnews.com |accessdate=25 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726104057/http://onthescene.blogs.foxnews.com/2008/06/20/10-iraqis-you-should-know/#Nadhm |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Auchi graduated with a B.Sc. in Economics and Political Science from [[Al-Mustansiriya University]], Baghdad, in 1967. He also worked with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil, becoming Director of Planning and Development in 1969.&lt;ref name="NAF1" /&gt; In 1979 he founded [[General Mediterranean Holding]] SA in [[Luxembourg]]. He was also Vice-Chair of the [[Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] from 1996 and 2000.

He has been president of the Anglo Arab Organisation (AAO), since its founding in 2002. The AAO is a private non-profit making organisation, promoting the integration of British Arabs into mainstream British society, whilst retaining their identity. AAO's achievements include donating money to families affected by the earthquake in Pakistan in 2005, building a school in the earthquake-devastated town of [[Hoceima]], Morocco and hosting a charity gala that collected £35,000 in donations to the benefit of the Cancer Research Unit of the [[Kingston Hospital]] in London. Auchi and AAO have also led and sponsored high level delegations made up of Arab, British and French dignitaries, religious and political figures pressing for the release of hostages in Baghdad, including securing the release of two French journalists, Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot and their Syrian driver in 2004.

In 2007, Auchi, in collaboration with the [[American University in Cairo]] (AUC) announced the launch of the 'Nadhmi Auchi fellowship for young Arab leaders', a fellowship dedicated to the development of the abilities of Arab youth in institution management and leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=22900|title=Auchi launches fellowship for young Arab leaders|work=Middle East Online|year=2007|accessdate=2008-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auchi pays the full study and living costs of ten students from Egypt and other Arab states. The fellowship plan was announced during an annual ceremony at the Egyptian Embassy in London to celebrate AUC achievements.

==Honours and awards==
In 1996, the [[President of Tunisia]], [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]], made him an Officer of the Order of the Republic. In 2002, he was also awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of Independence by [[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah II of Jordan]].

In 2003, Auchi was made a Knight Grand Cross of the [[Royal Order of Francis I]] (GCFO) by [[Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro]], this in recognition of his major contributions to inter-church and inter-faith dialogue. In England, the [[College of Arms]] approved his [[English heraldry|Coat of Arms]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/Newsletter/001.htm|title=The College of Arms Newsletter|publisher=The College of Arms|year=2004|accessdate=2008-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year the president of the [[Republic of Lebanon]], [[Émile Lahoud]], awarded Auchi with the Membership First Grade of the [[Order of Merit (Lebanon)|Lebanese Order of Merit]], having already appointed him as a Commander of the [[National Order of the Cedar]] in 2000. He was made a Knight of the [[Order of St. Sylvester]] (KSS) by Pope [[John Paul II]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constantinian.com/news-2004.html|title=The Grand Magistral Delegation for Inter Religious Relations|publisher=The Sacred Military Constantinian Order of St George|year=2008|accessdate=2008-11-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122055446/http://constantinian.com/news-2004.html|archivedate=2009-01-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Auchi was made Grao-Mestre da Ordem do Merito Anhanguera in Brazil and was elected as an Honorary Member in the [[International College of Surgeons]] in [[Chicago]], Illinois.

Auchi was awarded 'The Presidential Prize' in 2007 by the President of the American University in Cairo, this in appreciation of his efforts in supporting higher education in the Arab World.

On 18 July 2013, he was awarded the [[Freedom of the City of London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://democracy.cityoflondon.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=17687 |title=City of London, Council Meeting Minutes, 18 July 2013 |publisher=Democracy.cityoflondon.gov.uk |date=2013-07-18 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 2014, Auchi was appointed a Knight Commander of [[Order of the Nation (Antigua and Barbuda)|the Most Distinguished Order of the Nation]] (KCN) of [[Antigua and Barbuda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ab.gov.ag/article_details.php?id=5041&amp;category=38 Official Website of the Government of Antigua and Barbuda]&lt;/ref&gt; This knighthood was later removed by the Governor General of Antigua following accusations around the circumstances in which it was given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3614462/Queen-s-envoy-honours-scandal-Title-given-Commonwealth-chief-s-crony-reviewed-amid-Palace-fury.html|title=Title given to Commonwealth chief's crony 'reviewed' amid Palace fury|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction for fraud==
In 2003, Auchi was convicted of fraud following his involvement in a $504 million corruption scandal centred on the French oil company [[Elf Aquitaine]], described as "the biggest political and corporate sleaze scandal to hit a western democracy since the second world war".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/nov/15/uk.economy "Corruption scandal hits senior politicians"]  ''The Guardian'' 23 Nov, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/nov/13/france.oilandpetrol "Gigantic sleaze scandal winds up as former Elf oil chiefs are jailed"] ''The Guardian'' 13 Nov, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Auchi was given a $2.8 million fine, along with a 15-month suspended jail sentence, for his involvement in the 1991 purchase by Elf Aquitaine of various Spanish oil refineries and petrol stations, having been accused by prosecutors of funneling $118 million of illegal commissions back to the Elf executives who had initially set up the deal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/07/france.oil "Oil scandal billionaire tells French court of bribes"] ''The Guardian'' 7 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the verdict, Elf (by now merged with TotalFina and renamed Total) decided to take legal action against Auchi in France; Auchi responded by suing Total for $327 million in turn, this time in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/unwelcome-publicity-for-oil-giant-in-legal-battle-with-billionaire-820750.html "Unwelcome publicity for oil giant in legal battle with billionaire"] ''The Independent'' 4 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Norwest Lake.jpg|thumb|Norwest Lake, Norwest Business Park]]
The '''Norwest Business Park''' is a [[business park]] in the suburb of [[Norwest, New South Wales|Norwest]] in [[Local government areas of New South Wales|local government area]] of [[The Hills Shire]] in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. Norwest Business Park is bordered by [[Windsor Road (Sydney)|Windsor Road]] to the East, and Old Windsor Road to the West, with Norwest Boulevard stretching the length of the park between the two main arterial roads. It is growing every day with new companies moving in to serve the people of the [[Hills District]]. Over 400 companies are located in the park employing more than 25,000 people. The complex consists of a mix of Commercial, Professional &amp; Health care Services and several office buildings.

Australia's largest ice-skating rink, a [[Shopping mall|shopping centre]], [[Novotel]] hotel, two [[Filling station|service stations]], [[Hillsong Church]], [[Virgin Active]] gym, alternative health services, medical centre, commercial law firm [[HWL Ebsworth]], banks, child care centres, drive-through post office, waterways and landscaped public open spaces are all located within the Business Park. Projected employment is 32,000 by 2031. The park is 172 Hectares in area and currently has 800 businesses. Occupied space is currently 500,000m² with Potential for a total of 1.7 million m².

==History==
The park was established in 1983, during the Sydney housing boom. Farms had previously occupied the area.  The park grew with the expanding population of the area, and the first business to be constructed was the Baulkham Hills Coles supermarket, known as Norwest Markettown.

The expansion of the Hillsong Church in the area saw a corresponding expansion in the businesses of the area. In 2005, the [[Woolworths Limited]] head office was constructed, and now employs several thousand staff. Cafes and restaurants also serve the park.

Other large scale corporations in the Norwest Business Park include ResMed, [[Australian Associated Motor Insurers Limited|AAMI Insurance]], [[Fitness First]] gym, and one of the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]]'s data centers.

[[Subaru]] Australia has an office in Baulkham Hills part of this business area.

Norwest also houses Australia's largest law firm (by partner numbers), [[HWL Ebsworth|HWL Ebsworth Lawyers]], being the only national firm with a presence in Greater Western Sydney.

The park was conceived &amp; developed by Douglas Boyd Lanceley.

==Transport==
The main form of transport to the business park is by bus or by cycling on the off-road Old Windsor Road Cycleway. In late 2005, the [[Westlink M7]] Motorway opened up with an exit at the western end of Norwest Boulevard; this gave the business park greater exposure for businesses in Southern and Western Sydney with motorway exits at the M5 at Prestons and the M4 at Eastern Creek respectively.  The [[M2 Hills Motorway]] (which connects with the M7 near Old Windsor Road) also provides travel connections to the Sydney CBD and airport. However the increase of traffic flow from the motorways brought traffic congestion. Norwest Boulevard, Windsor and Old Windsor Roads often suffer traffic jams during morning and afternoon peak times.

===North-West T-Way===
{{Main|North-West T-way}}
In late March 2007, the North West T-Way opened, providing relief to the traffic congested business park. The T-Way runs from [[Parramatta]] to Rouse Hill. The T-Way provides frequent bus services between Parramatta and Rouse Hill, promoting the use of public transport in and around Sydney. The route runs primarily along Old Windsor Road with several stops. Three T-way bus stations serve Norwest Business Park; Norbrik (near the corner of Old Windsor Road and Norbrik Drive), Meurants (near the corner of Old Windsor Road and Norwest Boulevard and Celebration (near the corner of Old Windsor Road and Celebration Drive). [[Hillsbus]] Route T64 between Parramatta and Rouse Hill travels through the business park seven days a week. Hillsbus also operate route 618 from the [[Sydney CBD]] via [[Lane Cove]] and route 628 from [[Macquarie Park]] via the M2, Windsor Road through Norwest Boulevard to Lexington Drive. Busways operate Route T70 through Norwest Business Park, linking with Castle Hill and Blacktown.

The North West T-Way also runs from Blacktown to Rouse Hill, running along Sunnyholt Road before joining the Parramatta - Rouse Hill T-Way at Burns Road. Until the [[North West Rail Link]] is constructed, the T-Way is the only form of public transport linking the park with Blacktown and Parramatta train stations.

The EIS for the construction of two underground railway stations for [http://northwestrail.com.au North West Rail]
was released in April 2012 with construction expected to start in 2014. Construction of the rail link commenced in 2014, with two railway stations being built in the Norwest Business Park area - Bella Vista Station and Norwest Station. The North West Rail Link is scheduled to open to the public in the first half of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;http://nwrail.transport.nsw.gov.au/The-Project/Project-Overview&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oliver James "O. J." Seraphin''' (or '''Seraphine'''; born August 2, 1943) was the Minister of communication and works and housing for the Labour Party government from 1975- 1979 and  [[List of Prime Ministers of Dominica|Prime Minister]] of [[Dominica]] from June 25, 1979, until July 21, 1980.

==Early life==
Seraphin grew up in [[Roseau]], the capital, and received primary and secondary education at [[Roseau Mixed School]] and [[Dominica Grammar School]]; later in life, he studied at the [[Carnegie Institute of Technology|Carnegie Institute]] in the [[United States]] and in [[Cuba]]. Prior to politics, he worked in the insurance industry.&lt;ref name="lhc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lennoxhonychurch.com/heritage.cfm?Id=214 |title=Seraphin, Oliver, James "O.J.": |accessdate=2006-11-10 |last=Honychurch |first=Lennox |date= |work=Lennox Honychurch's A-to-Z of Dominica's Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government Minister==
He served in the socialist [[Dominica Labour Party]] government of Prime Minister [[Patrick John]] from 1975 to 1979. Seraphin originally held the posts of Minister of Communications, Works, and Housing, but in a cabinet reshuffle, the Prime Minister made him Minister of Agriculture, Lands, Fisheries and [[Caribbean Community|Caricom]] Affairs.&lt;ref name="lhc" /&gt; During this time, the Commonwealth of Dominica gained its independence from the [[United Kingdom]]. When violent crowds opposed to the John government protested outside the [[House of Assembly of Dominica|House of Assembly]], Seraphin resigned.&lt;ref name="lhc" /&gt;
[[Image:David 1979 track.png|right|thumb|200px|The path of Hurricane David. Dominica is obscured by an orange dot.]]

==Time as Prime Minister==
Seraphin became Prime Minister on June 25 1979, at the request of the "Committee of National Salvation." In August 1979, Dominica was hit by [[Hurricane David]], which killed over 76 people, and devastated much of the island.  Seraphin was preoccupied with rescue and rebuilding efforts. He traveled to [[Barbados]], [[Canada]], [[France]], the United States, and [[Venezuela]] to seek financial aid for rebuilding his country's infrastructure, in which he did. He was known to also help and rebuild homes for the homeless financing it all from his own personal account. He restored the island and helped create jobs. 
In his one (1) plus year in office he is set to have helped over half of the population of the island in the most biggest hurricane disaster the commonwealth of Dominica has ever faced.

==Childhood==
Bin Laden was born the grandson of [[Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden]], the founder of one of the wealthiest non-royal families in Saudi Arabia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20070319_103225_103225|title=Happy 50th, Osama: More than five years since 9/11, bin Laden, at mid-life, terrorizes us still|author=Michael Petrou|date=2007-03-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527192942/http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20070319_103225_103225|archivedate=2012-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the son of [[Osama bin Laden]], whose partisan activities shaped his childhood. Bin Laden accompanied his father on his exile to [[Sudan]] from 1991 to 1996, and then to [[Afghanistan]] after that.&lt;ref name="Schemm"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bismarcktribune.com/articles/2008/01/17/ap/international/d8u7uoi00.txt |title=Bin Laden Son Wants to Be Pe Activist |publisher=Bismarck Tribune |author=Paul Schemm |date=2008-01-17 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that he trained in [[al-Qaeda]] camps beginning at the age of 14, but after training with al-Qaeda for six years and sharing a house with al-Qaeda's second-in-command [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], he left al-Qaeda in 2000 because he did not want to be associated with killing civilians and his father Osama did not object.&lt;ref name="CNN1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/01/21/binladen.son/index.html|title=Bin Laden's son to father: Change your ways|author=Aneesh Raman|date=2008-01-21|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leonard"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/01/22/wosama122.xml|title=

In 2010, Omar bin Laden told [[ABC News]] that Osama had severely beaten him when he was a child for smiling too widely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Health/MindMoodNews/omar-bin-laden-mental-illness-caused-genes-stress/story?id=11624890&amp;singlePage=true Omar Bin Laden: Mental Illness Caused by Genes or Stress? - ABC News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden ran his own company in [[Jeddah]] prior to 2006 as a contractor and scrap metal dealer.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; Jeddah, a major city and important transit port for Saudi Arabia, is the site of the headquarters of the [[Saudi Binladen Group]] and has been reported to be "truly" ruled by [[Bakr bin Laden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Georg Mascolo and Erich Follath|title = Osama's Road to Riches and Terror|date=2005-06-06|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,359690,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage to Zaina Mohamed Al-Sabah===
Omar married Jane Felix-Browne, who also goes by the name Zaina Mohamed Al-Sabah, a parish councillor from [[Moulton, Cheshire|Moulton]], near [[Northwich]] in [[Cheshire]] in the [[United Kingdom]], on September 15, 2006.&lt;ref name="AnonBBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/6292072.stm|title=Councillor weds Bin Laden's son|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2007-07-11|accessdate=2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The marriage was conducted in September 2006 in Islamic ceremonies in both Egypt and Saudi Arabia, after which the couple spent a few months together in Jeddah before Zaina returned to Britain for several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19706669/|title=U.K. divorcee reportedly marries bin Laden son| date= 2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008h48b BBC One - Mr and Mrs Bin Laden&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported that  Felix-Browne met bin Laden while she was undergoing treatment for [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-07-11-osama-marriage_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=British woman says she wed Osama's son | date=2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://despardes.com/NewsExplorer/2007/20070712-bin-laden-marries.html|title=Brit bin Laden "Bahu" Raises Eyebrows}}&lt;/ref&gt; They met on a horseback ride at the [[Giza pyramids]] in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Schemm" /&gt; She is his second wife and 24 years older than he is, with five grandchildren.&lt;ref name="AnonBBC" /&gt;  She was aware when she married Omar that he had been  married and divorced, with a two-year-old son.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

After their wedding, Al-Sabah described the stress of bin Laden's family background: "Omar is wary of everyone. He is constantly watching people who he feels might be following him. Not without reason he is fearful of cameras. He is the son of Osama. But when we are together he forgets his life." The couple announced their divorce in September 2007, which was said to be in response to threats to their "lives and liberty" from two unspecified sources known to them in Saudi Arabia. At the time, Al-Sabah said she did not regard herself as divorced and that as the divorce was done under duress did not have legal standing under [[Sharia]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Briton to divorce bin Laden's son|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7003047.stm|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2007-09-18|accessdate=2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two weeks, Zaina and Omar decided not to part.

In January 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-507873/Bin-Ladens-son-wants-visa--grandmother-bride-live-Cheshire-surrogate-baby.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Bin Laden's son wants a visa - so he and his grandmother bride can live in Cheshire and have a surrogate baby | date=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; bin Laden applied for a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[European Economic Area Family Permit|spousal immigration visa]] which would have permitted him to reside indefinitely at his wife's home in [[Moulton, Cheshire]], a process which required him to provide original documentation of his divorce from his first wife. The couple stated their desire to have a child using a [[surrogate mother]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23046270-401,00.html|title=Bin Laden's son applies for British visa|date=2008-01-14 | work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One report stated the visa application was denied because Omar failed to provide his father's permanent address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cbs2chicago.com/watercooler/Osama.bin.Laden.2.286421.html |title=British Divorcee Marries Son Of Osama Bin Laden |publisher=CBS |date=2007-07-11 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a later report by ''[[The Times]]'' of Omar's appeal stated that the visa had been denied by an entry clearance officer at the UK embassy in Cairo because Omar's entry would cause "considerable public concern."  The officer was quoted, "I note that statements made during recent media interviews indicate evidence of continuing loyalty to your father, and your presence in the UK could, therefore, cause considerable public concern." This written statement was shown to [[The Associated Press]] by the couple's legal firm, but Britain's [[Home Office]] declined to comment to the press on an individual case. In April 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-563042/Bin-Ladens-son-plans-legal-challenge-battle-UK-visa.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Bin Laden's son plans legal challenge to battle for UK visa | date=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; bin Laden and Al-Sabah said they planned to appeal the ruling, calling it "unjust and arbitrary", stating that Al-Sabah requires medical attention in Britain and that her appeal to live with him in Saudi Arabia could take years to process. As of April 2008, bin Laden has a house in Cairo.

In April 2010, bin Laden was denied a visa to promote his book ''[[Osama bin Laden: A Family Portrait]]'' in France and elsewhere in Europe.
Specifically, the countries of the [[Schengen Area|Schengen zone]], a block of 25 nations across Europe including Germany, France and Spain, rejected his request for a visa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/world/europe/16briefs-francebrf.html | work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Erlanger | title=France: Bin Laden Son Is Denied Visa | date=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myfoxtampabay.com/story/18048686/bin-ladens-son-denied-visa-for-european-book-tour Bin Laden's Son Denied Visa for European Book Tour - FOX 13 News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, Felix-Browne told the media that bin Laden suffers from [[bipolar disorder]] and that he was in a [[Qatar]]i mental institution after [[Auditory hallucination|hearing voices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/3047072/Omar-bin-Ladens-wife-on-why-they-split-up.html | location=London | work=The Sun | first=Jenna | last=Sloan | title=Omar bin Laden’s wife on why they split up – The Sun –Features}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1293277/Bin-Ladens-son-wife-Zaina-split-heard-Osamas-voice-head.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Bin Laden's son and British wife split after he heard 'Osama's voice in his head' | date=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Felix-Browne told the media that when bin Laden returned to the UK, Felix-Browne told him she wanted a divorce. As of 2015, Omar and Zaina have been married for 9 years and are living in an undisclosed country. All previous talk of divorce was publicized under duress and threats to their lives and their families lives.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}} However, Omar bin Laden's divorce allegations were confirmed by Qatar's Gulf News with the report that a disagreement about the adoption of a surrogate child led to the dissolution of his second marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/qatar/exclusive-omar-bin-laden-divorces-second-wife-1.649494 "Exclusive: Omar Bin Laden divorces second wife"].

===North African horse race===
[[File:Dakar traces mauritanie.jpg|thumb|[[Dakar Rally]] track through the [[Mauritania]]n [[Sahara]], 2005]]
In January 2008, an [[Associated Press]] interview in [[Cairo]] featured bin Laden with [[cornrows]] and a black leather biker jacket promoting a {{convert|3000|mi|km|sing=on}} horse race for peace across North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailycomet.com/article/20080117/API/801170791|title=Bin Laden Son Wants to Be Peace Activist}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[PETA]] president [[Ingrid E. Newkirk]] called for the cancellation of the race in an "urgent letter" from the organization, predicting that the gruelling race would lead to fatalities among the horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2008/February/middleeast_February43.xml&amp;section=middleeast|title=PETA urges Laden’s son to cancel horse race|date=2008-02-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628161824/http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data%2Fmiddleeast%2F2008%2FFebruary%2Fmiddleeast_February43.xml&amp;section=middleeast|archivedate=2008-06-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3314629.ece|title=People: Kylie Minogue, James Blunt, Emma Thompson | work=The Times | location=London | date=2008-02-06 | accessdate=2010-05-20}} (''Collection of news shorts'')&lt;/ref&gt;

Omar described the race as an equine counterpart to the cancelled 2008 [[Dakar rally|Paris-Dakar car rally]], saying, "I heard the rally was stopped because of al-Qaida.  I don't think they are going to stop me."&lt;ref name="Schemm" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23073535-663,00.html|title=Omar Osama bin Laden organising horse race for peace | work=Herald Sun | first=Paul | last=Schemm | date=2008-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The race was canceled after the killings of four French tourists near [[Aleg]], [[Mauritania]] on [[Christmas Eve]] 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7159420.stm|title=Tourists shot dead in Mauritania|publisher=BBC|date=2007-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the murders race organizers received threats directly from heavily armed and organized groups linked to al-Qaeda, which led them to cancel the race on January 4, 2008, and soon after to plan the 2009 event for South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/news/story?seriesId=99&amp;id=3180745&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=ESPNHeadlines|title=Terror threat leads to cancellation of Dakar Rally}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/rally/42490/|title=Dakar Rally to Relocate to South America?|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119170257/http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/rally/42490/|archivedate=2008-01-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Police in [[Guinea-Bissau]] said that two of five men arrested for the crime on January 11, 2008, admitted their involvement with al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L12305244.htm|title=Bissau extradites al Qaeda suspects to Mauritania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to his father and al-Qaeda===
Omar said that his father felt that he was just trying to defend the Islamic world,&lt;ref name="Schemm" /&gt; and that his father was not a terrorist "because history tells you he's not".&lt;ref name="Leonard" /&gt;  In an interview with [[ABC News]], he said, "My father is a very kind man. And he very sorry when he did something like 11th September."  Osama ordered the attacks "Because he believes if he put two buildings down, maybe some people, little will die, but millions other will (be) save(d). He believed that. ... I believe he did wrong".&lt;ref name="Watt" /&gt;  In a January 21, 2008, [[CNN]] interview, he said "I try and say to my father: 'Try to find another way to help or find your goal. This bomb, these weapons, it's not good to use them on anybody".  Regarding the September 11 attacks, he said,  "I don't think 9/11 was right personally, but it happened.  I don't think ... [the war] in Vietnam was right. I don't think what's going on in Palestine is right. I don't think what's going on in Iraq is right.  If we make what is right and not right, we will make a very big list."&lt;ref name="CNN1" /&gt;

Bin Laden stated that he had not been in contact with his father since leaving Afghanistan in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/01182008/news/worldnews/bin_laden_son__i_am_for_peace_618930.htm |title=Bin Laden son: I am for peace |publisher=New York Post |date=2008-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120111906/http://www.nypost.com/seven/01182008/news/worldnews/bin_laden_son__i_am_for_peace_618930.htm |archivedate=January 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He said, "The last time I saw my father was in 2000, 2001. I was in Saudi Arabia and felt a terrible sorrow for all the victims [of the September 11 attacks]", "My father has a kind heart", and "I do not believe my father is dead, otherwise I would have known it; the world would have known it."&lt;ref name="news24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_2264941,00.html|title=Bin Laden wants to meet pope|date=2008-02-05|access-date=2008-11-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122121101/http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_2264941,00.html|archive-date=2008-11-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When asked whether he would tell the Americans if he found out where his father was living, he said with a smile, "Actually, I would hide him.  Because he is my father."&lt;ref name="Watt" /&gt;

According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Omar has stated a desire to become an "ambassador of peace" between Muslims and the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/quotes/0,26174,1704818,00.html|title=Friday, Jan. 18, 2008 - Quotes of the Day | work=Time | accessdate=2010-05-20|date=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Omar said that his father offered a truce to Europe in a 2004 videotape and a conditional truce with the United States in a [[19 January 2006 Osama bin Laden tape|2006 videotape]].  "My father is asking for a truce but I don't think there is any government (that) respects him. At the same time they do not respect him, why everywhere in the world, they want to fight him?  There is a contradiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=9fa22d77-2c70-4303-98e4-8051f9fe560b&amp;ParentID=077ccdc8-c902-4dca-916a-a8e2c7e797e2&amp;&amp;Headline=Osama's+son+wants+to+be+a+'peace+ambassador'|title=Osama's son wants to be peace ambassador between West and Muslims}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The truces offered in these [[videos of Osama bin Laden]] were promptly rejected at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3627775.stm|date=2004-04-15|title=UK 'Bin Laden' offers Europe truce|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/04/15/binladen.tape/index.html|title=Europe: No deal with bin Laden|publisher=CNN|date=2004-04-15 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/01/19/binladen.tape/index.html|title=U.S. rejects bin Laden tape's 'truce' offer|publisher=CNN|date=2006-01-20 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After arriving in [[Rome]] from [[Switzerland]] amid heavy security on February 2, 2008, bin Laden said in a television interview that night "I would very much like to meet the [[Pope]] in [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's]], but I have been told that it is not easy."&lt;ref name="news24" /&gt;

===Asylum petitions===
On November 3, 2008, [[Spain]]'s Interior Ministry, upon recommendation by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] denied, for "insufficient evidence of danger or threat to [his] life", Omar's [[Right of asylum|political asylum]] petition, after he was refused a UK visa. Omar had 24 hours to appeal, after he made his claim at Madrid's [[Barajas International Airport]] upon a stopover on a flight from [[Cairo, Egypt]] to [[Casablanca, Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7712224.stm  news.bbc.co.uk, Bin Laden son asylum bid rejected]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/world/europe/06briefs-ASYLUMDENIED_BRF.html  nytimes.com, Spain: Asylum Denied to One of bin Laden’s Sons]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/11/05/osama.son.spain/?iref=mpstoryview edition.cnn.com, Bin Laden son loses asylum plea]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden and his wife arrived in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]] (where, as a Saudi citizen with a Saudi passport, he would have right of entry), on November 9, 2008, after deportation by Egypt per its denial of their entry.

Omar filed another British visa petition in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL9718792.html africa.reuters.com, Bin Laden son, rejected by Egypt, arrives in Qatar]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200811/200811100005.html english.chosun.com, Egypt Refuses Entry to Bin Laden's Son]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world/view/388702/1/.html www.channelnewsasia.com, Osama bin Laden's son in Qatar after being deported from Egypt]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book===
Bin Laden and his mother [[Najwa bin Laden]] published a book authored in late October 2009, titled ''[[Growing Up bin Laden]]''. According to media coverage, the book details that "the kids grew up in Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Afghanistan without laughter or toys, were routinely beaten, and lost their pets to painful death from poison gas experiments by their father's fighters." It states that Osama bin Laden tried to persuade his son to volunteer for suicide missions and exposed him to dangerous conditions visiting training camps in Afghanistan and sending him to the front lines of the [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghan civil war]]. The book describes the family living in [[Jeddah]] without air conditioning or refrigeration, treating [[asthma]] with [[honeycomb]]s and onions, and eventually moving to stone huts in [[Tora Bora]] without electricity or running water in 1996.

Subsequent correspondence with the Associated Press indicated that 25 bin Laden family members had moved to Iran, following U.S. involvement in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1932318,00.html|title=Growing Up bin Laden: Osama's Son Speaks|publisher=Time Magazine|date=2009-10-07|author=Andrew Lee Butters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/international/item_FotvaRLEtYyNGoPTTlcLwK|title=Tales from the Bin Laden clan:Wife and son bare secrets of terror kingpin|date=2009-10-11|author=[[Susannah Cahalan]]|publisher=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Osama-bin-Ladens-family-parenting-exposed-in-sons-book/tabid/417/articleID/136255/Default.aspx?ArticleID=136255|title=Osama bin Laden's family, parenting exposed in son's book|date=2010-01-06|author=Donna Abu-Nasr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2010/01/son_of_osama_bin_laden_describ.html|title=Son of Osama bin Laden describes brutal childhood|publisher=Associated Press|date=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Growing Up Bin Laden:Osama's Wife and Son Take Us Inside Their Secret World'', [[Jean Sasson]], Omar bin Laden, and Najwa bin Laden (St. Martin's Press) 2009.  {{ISBN|978-0-312-56016-4}}, {{ISBN|0-312-56016-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of his father===
{{Further information|Death of Osama bin Laden}}
Bin Laden published a complaint on May 10, 2011, that the [[Death of Osama bin Laden#Burial at sea|burial at sea]] of his father [[Osama bin Laden|Osama]] deprived the family of a proper burial. He made several other claims regarding the mission that killed his father, such as stating that no one living at the compound was armed; {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} he also requested that the UN and other international groups investigate the killing of Osama as a criminal matter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/world/asia/binladen-statement.html "Statement From the Family of Osama bin Laden"]. ''[[The New York Times]]]''. May 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His requests were ignored by the U.S. and no actions based on them have been taken so far.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

'''Porto Digital''' is an initiative in [[Recife]], [[Brazil]] to foster technological innovation in the northern region of Brazil. It began in July 2000 on the island called [[Recife Antigo|Old Recife]], where the port was located from the time of the 17th century Dutch occupation of the area. Recife is the capital of the state of [[Pernambuco]] in the Northeast region of Brazil. The Porto Digital has grown steadily since 2000, reporting 240 technology companies and 500 entrepreneurs within the zone, and another 150 similar companies in Recife but not on the island by 2014.&lt;ref name=Engel2014 /&gt;

==History and development ==
[[File:Pontes do Bairro do Recife Antigo.jpg|thumb|View of Porto Digital in 2012]]
Porto Digital was created in [[Recife]] in July 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oremi.com.br/artigo/arquivos/081016150721_030-BRA_Proceedings.pdf |title=A City and its Science Park: building a local innovation system for urban and economic development |work=XXV IASP World Conference 2008 |first=Fabio Queda |last=Bueno da Silva |accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of a  joint effort  of the [[Pernambuco]] state government, private sector and the [[Inter-American Development Bank]](IDB). Most of the funding for the creation of the Porto Digital Science Park came from the privatization of CELPE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaplac.org/library/AlbernazAmi03.pdf |title=The Internet in Brazil: From Digital Divide to Democracy? |last=Albamaz |first=Ami |date=May 3, 2002 |accessdate=March 10, 2017 |publisher=Association of Academic Programs in Latin America and the Caribbean}}&lt;/ref&gt; the state’s electricity company. The companies and incubators that form the Science Park are mostly housed in buildings most of which warehoused sugar in colonial times, on the island that is known as [[Recife Antigo|Old Recife]]. The city is the ninth largest in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://exame.abril.com.br/brasil/noticias/as-300-cidades-mais-populosas-do-brasil-em-2013 |title=As 300 cidades mais populosas do Brasil em 2013 |trans-title=The 300 most populous cities in Brazil in 2013 |date=September 9, 2013 |last=Prates |first=Marco |language=Portuguese |newspaper=Exame |accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Porto Digital  hosts C.E.S.A.R., the most innovative R&amp;D institute of Brazil, according to a Federal Government assessment in 2004.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The Science Park was evaluated as the largest of Brazil in 2005 by AT Kearney and won in 2007 the prize of the best Brazilian Science Park, given by the Brazilian Association of Science Parks and Business Incubators (ANPROTEC).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} It was described in 2013 as a coordinated effort between the federal and state governments, becoming an economic keystone in Pernambuco state since its start in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gRqcAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=Porto+Digital+Recife+status&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jHp2h5JPsm&amp;sig=KhZB6Jtz3PwKA2D2jgnOnxljm-w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-oubwu83SAhVB9IMKHQWhCN8Q6AEITDAL#v=onepage&amp;q=Porto%20Digital%20Recife%20status&amp;f=false |title=Development Centre Studies Start-up Latin America Promoting Innovation in the Region: Promoting Innovation in the Region |page=142 |date=September 2, 2013 |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] |isbn=9789264202306 |accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government investments==

The local and federal government do not directly pool resources in order to invest in the park, they offer however a certain amount of fiscal incentives to its companies. The biggest ones are a discount of up to 60 per cent on the '''ISS''', a sort of municipal services tax and the "Lei de Informática" (Leis 8.248/91, 10.176/01 e 11.077/04) which concedes reduction of the '''IPI''' taxes for companies which develop hardware and automation solutions. In a country with one of the world’s most onerous tax systems, fiscal incentives are a game changing and decisive factor for the success of a tech hub in the region. The incentives are not only tax reductions but also labor incentives: by reducing bureaucracy and costs involved in the process of hiring new workforce.

The lack of real government funding for the tech hub is mainly due to lack of long-term planning strategy to foster the technological sector of the region. A program similar to Ohio’s [[Third Frontier]] could not only benefit the region but the whole country. Ohio’s Third Frontier showed an unprecedented large scope of financial support at different key sectors of Ohio’s economy. The public sector dollars are very important in creating momentum in a very short amount of time, which would not necessarily happen so fast with exclusive private sector rounds of investment. Two key aspects of the Third Frontier program are the outside match requirement (government funds must be matched by another funding source). The second factor in the process is the validation and recommendation options for allocation of resources. This work alongside the private sector produces high standards of professionalism and transparency in the process.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Third Frontier has also been able to measure its success through metrics such as job creation and the increase in productivity and quality in existing jobs. The most similar program to Ohio’s Third Frontier is the Start-up Brasil program implemented by the Brazilian federal government. Start-up Brasil was created by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI) - in order to provide support to emerging technology-based companies and to strengthen their connection to accelerators. The funds made available by the federal government for the program allow up to R$200,000 in direct investment for selected startups.

Start-up Brasil focus on domestic companies, that have been incorporated for less than four years. International companies can also apply for the program as long as they incorporate in Brazil within a certain time frame.

The accelerators act as third party evaluators by selecting and mentoring startups for the program; there is no outside match requirement, that is, government funds do not have to be matched by another funding source.

==Corporate partnerships  ==
Business incubator and innovation center Recife Center for Advanced Studies and Systems (C.E.S.A.R) is the largest business of Porto Digital and works as a flagship company of the technological park. One of the reasons for the success of the Digital Port is the high-skilled workforce delivered by the Center of Informatics (CIn) of the Federal University of Pernambuco, (UFPE). Sergio Cavalcante, CEO of C.E.S.A.R is also a professor at CIn, which shows a healthy and close relationship between industry and academy. An entrepreneurial spirit is also cultivated in the university through an “Entrepreneurship Project” Course “Projetao”, which helps students develop innovative ideas and turn them into products. Many of the products developed on this course grew to be real products sold by real startups. One success story is that of In Loco Media (previously UBee) which developed an accurate indoors location app. The company offers a mobile Ad-network powered by its indoor location technology and boasts to be the largest Brazilian mobile advertising company. Porto Digital is a research development center for international clients like [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/fiat-chrysler-invests-53m-in-brazil-r-d-center/ |title=Fiat Chrysler invests $53m in Brazil R&amp;D center |date=December 7, 2015 |accessdate=December 8, 2015 |publisher=ZDNet |last=Mari |first=Angelica}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Goals of Porto Digital ==
The strategy of Porto Digital includes 10 year plans. Its vision and main objective is to be the best environment in the country for disruptive innovation and entrepreneurship on IT related areas and also on [[creative industries]]. Porto Digital intends to be a vital asset for the economical development of the state of Pernambuco and to be an anchor for the [[sustainable development]] of the region. The first strategic goal is to have, by 2020, 20,000 professionals employed and the aggregated value of 400 innovative enterprises. To achieve these goals, Porto Digital develops 40 articulated projects on 6 strategic areas:

1. Increase the capacity of Porto Digital to attract new investments and to strengthen the competitiveness of the businesses installed on the technological park;

2. Integration of the Porto Digital with other sectors of the economy which lack appropriate technological support;

3. National expansion and internationalization of Porto Digital;

4. Strengthening of the image and brand of the technological park;

5. Actions to promote social, economic and environmental susteinability;

6. Strengthening of the technical and managerial capabilities of the Porto Digital.

In 2014, Porto Digital included 500 entrepreneurs and 240 institutions, with another 150 related companies located in Recife but not in the Porto Digital zone.&lt;ref name=Engel2014&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rgyZBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA312&amp;lpg=PA312&amp;dq=Porto+Digital+Recife+status&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CRNxd_0-jn&amp;sig=RKo4fNrEbxsP4NNL6L8ID9ow4vI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-oubwu83SAhVB9IMKHQWhCN8Q6AEIRDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Porto%20Digital%20Recife%20status&amp;f=false |title=Global Clusters of Innovation: Entrepreneurial Engines of Economic Growth around the World |date=September 26, 2014 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |last=Engel |first=Jerome S. |page=316 |accessdate=March 10, 2017 |isbn=978-1783470839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==

The private organization responsible for running Porto Digital is a non-profit organization called the Porto Digital Management Unit (NGPD) and was entrusted by the government to be a flexible option to govern the technological park. NGPD not only runs Porto Digital but also tries to forge ties with other institutions which also promote social and economic development in the region.

Its management structure is based on an Administrative Council, with 18 members. These members represent the firms installed in the park, other companies with ties to the Porto Digital, the state government, [[UFPE]] university and Recife City Hall.
It is the Council’s responsibility to decide policies and strategies which enable and promote Porto Digital’s development. 
 
The Council has the freedom to appoint a board of directors of the NGPD comprising a president, a director of innovation and business competition and an executive officer. The NGPD’s permanent technical staff members all have degrees in fields related to innovation, information technology, project management, urban planning, etc.

In the [[United States]], a '''Psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner''' ('''PMHNP''') is an [[advanced practice registered nurse]] trained to provide a wide range of mental health services to patients and families in a variety of settings. PMHNPs diagnose, conduct therapy, and prescribe medications for patients who have psychiatric disorders, medical organic brain disorders or substance abuse problems. They are licensed to provide emergency psychiatric services, psychosocial and physical assessment of their patients, treatment plans, and manage patient care. They may also serve as consultants or as educators for families and staff. The PMHNP has a focus on psychiatric diagnosis, including the differential diagnosis of medical disorders with psychiatric symptoms, and on medication treatment for psychiatric disorders.

A PMHNP can often practice autonomously. In 27 states, [[nurse practitioners]] (NPs) already diagnose and treat with no physician involvement, and in 19 states prescribe medications independently. This is in contrast to 2008, when nurse practitioners could autonomously diagnose and treat in 23 states, and could only prescribe in 12 states. In other states, PMHNPs have a collaborative agreement with physicians or a standard scope of practice signed by a physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacbee.com/2013/05/24/5444645/make-better-use-of-nurse-practitioners.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927081055/http://www.sacbee.com/2013/05/24/5444645/make-better-use-of-nurse-practitioners.html |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, in these states, they still practice independently to diagnose disorders, provide therapy and prescribe medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apna.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3866|title=FAQs about Advanced Practice Psychiatric Nurses - American Psychiatric Nurses Association|website=www.apna.org|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titles and functions vary by state, but usually ''NP'', ''RNP'', or ''ARNP'' are used.

== Education ==
After completing a four-year Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), a Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner degree takes two to five more years of training.  First the individual must earn a four-year college degree in nursing ([[Bachelor of Science in Nursing|BSN]]).  Then, the candidate must complete an approved [[Master of Science in Nursing|Master's of Science in Nursing (MSN)]] or [[Doctor of Nursing Practice|Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP)]] advanced nursing education program.

Individuals who already have a bachelor's degree in another field can attend one of many accelerated BSN programs before entering an approved MSN or DNP program.  Accelerated BSN programs typically take one and a half to two years after completion of prerequisite coursework.  A new training modality is the Master's entry/graduate entry to practice nursing program model, which is specifically designed for those with bachelor's degrees in non-nursing fields.  Entrants to these programs typically spend one year taking Bachelor's level nursing classes to allow them to pass the [[NCLEX-RN]], and then go straight into an additional 2 years of training along with a residency of at least 600 hours to complete a MSN degree.  Students must then successfully pass a Board examination to practice as a Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP). PMHNP-BC is the designated title for a [[Nursing board certification|board certified]] Advanced Practice Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner.

Effective 2015, the Doctorate in Nursing Practice (DNP) degree is the planned entry level degree for advanced practice registered nurses. However, no state has actually initiated any laws regarding the DNP as the minimum degree. Currently, the 2015 date is simply a goal put forth by the [[American Nurses Credentialing Center]] (ANCC). It is expected that current Master's-prepared nurses will be "grandfathered' into the new system and as long as they keep their certification current, they will not be required to pursue further education except the required continuing education.

There are many schools that offer the graduate education required for this profession. Notable schools with Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse practitioner programs are [[Vanderbilt University School of Nursing]], [[Yale School of Nursing]], [[Saint Louis University]], [[University of California-San Francisco]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Columbia University School of Nursing]].&lt;ref&gt;The State of California.  (2007, January 22).  ''California Board of Registered Nursing''  Retrieved February 9, 2007, from {{cite web |url=http://www.rn.ca.gov/practice/nps.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124173534/http://www.rn.ca.gov/practice/nps.htm |archivedate=2007-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A listing of PMHNP programs by state can be found online at the [[American Nurses Credentialing Center]] (ANCC) and [[American Psychiatric Nurses Association]] (APNA).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.apna.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3311&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aacn.nche.edu/dnp/program-directory&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of education can vary greatly.  Programs at public universities are typically less expensive for state residents than out-of-state-residents.  For example, at [[UCSF]] the cost for the Masters program with in-state tuition is approximately $12,245 a year; for an out-of-state student the tuition is $24,798.&lt;ref&gt;University of California, San Francisco.  (2007, February 6).  ''MS Specialty: Advanced Practice Psychiatric Nursing - UCSF School of Nursing''  Retrieved February 9, 2007, from http://nurseweb.ucsf.edu/www/spec-psy.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, programs at public universities tend to be less expensive than programs at private universities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15248">'''Reshoring''' (also known as '''onshoring''', '''inshoring''' and '''backshoring''') is the act of reintroducing domestic manufacturing to a country. It is the reverse process of [[offshoring]], where manufacturing is moved to another country where labor is cheaper. 

The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on the future of work &lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]&lt;/ref&gt; considers the potential for automation to drive companies to reshore production, reducing the role of labor in the proess, and offers suggestions as to how governments can respond.
 
== United States ==
For the last twenty years, American companies have been "[[offshoring]]" manufacturing to low cost countries such as [[China]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Vietnam]]. 
Even as recently as 2008 many companies were offshoring or [[nearshoring]] their manufacturing. In 2010, a group of manufacturers started the Reshoring Initiative, a movement focusing on bringing manufacturing jobs for American companies back to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.manortool.com/blog/top-reasons-for-reshoring-in-manufacturing/|title=Top Reasons for Reshoring in Manufacturing - Manor Tool|date=2015-01-29|work=Manor Tool|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reshoring Initiative reports that 140,000 American jobs were lost in 2003 due to offshoring. Eleven years later in 2014, the United States recovered 10,000 of those offshored positions; this marked the highest net gain in 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.industryweek.com/competitiveness/reshoring-numbers|title=Reshoring: By the Numbers|date=2017-03-20|work=IndustryWeek|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; America was deep into a recession and American citizens were pressuring companies to keep jobs in country. Reshoring efforts have become increasingly popular because of the positive impact on the domestic job market, as well as lowering the overall production cost for American manufacturing companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reshorenow.org/what-is-reshoring/|title=What is Reshoring? {{!}} Reshoring Initiative|last=Engineers|first=dgs Marketing|website=reshorenow.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voice of America says that bringing manufacturing and jobs back to America is the right thing to do.&lt;ref name="bsc4"&gt;{{Cite web

=== Government response ===
In response to the recession, President Obama launched the [[SelectUSA]] program in 2011,the first federal program to promote and facilitate U.S. investment in partnership with our states. This program and website helps companies connect with resources available on a Federal, State and local level. In January 2012, President Obama Issued a Call to Action to Invest in America at the White House "Insourcing American Jobs" Forum.&lt;ref name="whitehouse1"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this forum, he met with representatives from companies such as [[Otis Elevator]], [[DuPont]], NOVO1, [[Master Lock]] and many more, all of which had recently brought jobs back or made significant investments in the United States. In 2013, during his State of the Union speech President Obama stated that he wanted America to be a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing. He asked that manufacturers like [[Ford Motor Company]] and [[Apple Inc.]] bring manufacturing back the U.S. He talked about the new Innovation Institutes that are working on innovation and technology such as 3D printing that will help companies with Lean Manufacturing. He talked about the innovation in renewable and clean energy and how our future is dependent on both. The cameras panned the crowd and focused on Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, and explained that Apple had made a commitment to bring some of its manufacturing back to Silicon Valley.&lt;ref name="whitehouse2"&gt;{{Cite web

=== Success stories ===
Companies such as ET Water Systems, GE Appliances and Caterpillar found that with the increase of labor costs in Japan and China, the cost of shipping and custom fees, it cost only about 10% more to manufacture in America.&lt;ref name="econ1"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advances in technology such as Digital Manufacturing and Automation have made bringing manufacturing back to the United States both cost effective and possible. Especially advances in [[3D printing]] technologies bring manufacturers closer to their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Durach|first=Christian F.|last2=Kurpjuweit|first2=Stefan|last3=Wagner|first3=Stephan M.|date=2017-09-25|title=The impact of additive manufacturing on supply chains|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/IJPDLM-11-2016-0332|journal=International Journal of Physical Distribution &amp; Logistics Management|volume=47|issue=10|pages=954–971|doi=10.1108/ijpdlm-11-2016-0332|issn=0960-0035}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adidas]], for example, plans producing highly customized shoes with 3D printers in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-adidas-manufacturing/adidas-to-mass-produce-3d-printed-shoe-with-silicon-valley-start-up-idUSKBN1790F6|title=Adidas to mass-produce 3D-printed shoe with Silicon Valley start-up|date=7 April 2017|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this advanced technology companies are creating new innovative products for the U.S. market.

Not all manufacturing should return to the U.S.&lt;ref name="bsc1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reshoringinstitute.org/reshoring-blog/china-its-in-the-cards/|title=China – It’s in the Cards|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|work=Reshoring Institute Blog|accessdate=17 March 2014|author=Daisie Hobson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the middle class in China, India and other countries has created markets for the products made in those countries. As the U.S. has a "Made in U.S.A." program other countries support products made in their countries as well.  Localization, the process of manufacturing products for the local market, is an approach to keeping some manufacturing offshore and bringing some of it back. Besides the cost savings of manufacturing closer to the market, the lead time for adapting to changes in the market is faster.

There have been several very successful stories of companies that have reshored including most of the companies mentioned above. In most cases hundreds if not thousands of jobs were created or reinstated. In the case of  [[Starbucks]], in 2012 it saved American Mug and Stein Company in East Liverpool, Ohio from bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="strb1"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially only twelve people were put back to work but it was just the beginning for Starbucks. CEO Howard Schultz was compelled to take action; he teamed up with Opportunity Finance Network to found Create Jobs for USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://createjobsforusa.org/ |title=Create Jobs for USA |website=Opportunity Finance Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; He seeded the foundation with an initial grant of $5 million.  Later that year Starbucks announced that they are building another manufacturing facility in Georgia that will employ 140 people.&lt;ref name="strb2"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they originally only hired twelve people Starbucks got months of positive press.

=== Avoiding failure ===
There have been some cases of reshoring that weren't successful. Otis Elevators’ reshoring effort did not go well.&lt;ref name="bsc2"&gt;{{Cite web
 |url= http://ww2.cfo.com/supply-chain/2014/06/avoid-failed-reshoring-project/view-all
 |title=How To Avoid a Failed Reshoring Project
 |work=CFO
 |accessdate=9 June 2014
 |author=Rosemary Coates
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otis says it failed to consider the consequences of the new location and tried to do too much at once, including a supply-chain software implementation. This is not an uncommon reshoring scenario. Bringing manufacturing back to the United States isn’t so simple, and there are a lot of considerations and analyses that companies must do to determine the costs and feasibility of reshoring. Some companies pursue reshoring with their own internal staff.  But reshoring projects are complicated and involve engineering, marketing, production, finance, and procurement.  In addition, there are real estate concerns, government incentives and training requirements that require outreach to the community.  To help with these projects, companies often turn to consultants that specialize in Reshoring.&lt;ref name="bsc3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bluesilkconsulting.com/reshoring/|title=Are you ready to evaluate Reshoring?|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|work=Blue Silk Consulting Reshoring|author=Rosemary Coates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], companies have used the reintroduction of domestic [[call centres]] as a [[unique selling point]]. In 2014, the [[RSA Insurance Group]] completed a move of call centres back to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.insurancetimes.co.uk/rsa-completes-move-to-uk-only-call-centres/1409402.article|title=http://www.insurancetimes.co.uk/rsa-completes-move-to-uk-only-call-centres/1409402.article|work=Insurance Times|date=5 August 2014|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The call centre industry in [[India]] has been hit by reshoring, as businesses including [[British Telecom]], [[Santander UK]] and [[Aviva]] all announced they would move operations back to Britain in order to boost the economy and regain customer satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-07-14/news/29773439_1_uk-bank-uk-bpo-uk-companies|title=India may no longer be outsourcing hub as UK companies such as Aviva, BT &amp; Santander move work to home country|work=The Economic Times|date=14 July 2011|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3133">'''Strategic assumptions surfacing and testing''' ('''SAST''') is a method for approaching ill-structured problems.  It can be applied as a [[dialectical]] approach to policy and planning.

An ill-structured problem may alternatively be also labelled as a [[wicked problem]].  SAST may be applied as a technique of [[systems thinking]].

An ill-structured problem is "one for which various strategies for providing a possible solution rest on assumptions that are in sharp conflict with one another".&lt;ref&gt;Mitroff, I. I., and J. R. Emshoff. 1979. "On Strategic Assumption-making: A Dialectical Approach to Policy and Planning." ''Academy of Management Review'': 1–12. https://www.jstor.org/stable/257398&lt;/ref&gt;  The purposes for an SAST method are:
* to help surface for explicit examination the underlying assumptions that analysts often unconsciouly bring with them to a problem situation;
* to compare and to evaluate systematically the assumptions of different analysts;
* to examine the relationship between underlying assumptions and the resulting policies which are derived and dependent upon them; and
* to attempt to formulate new, novel, and originally unforeseen policies based on previously unforeseen assumptions.

Four stages in the method include:&lt;ref&gt;Mitroff, I. I., and J. R. Emshoff. 1979. “On Strategic Assumption-making: A Dialectical Approach to Policy and Planning.” ''Academy of Management Review'': 1–12. https://www.jstor.org/stable/257398&lt;/ref&gt;

# Assumption specification
# Dialectic phase 
# Assumption integration phase 
# Composite strategy creation

The method originated through the collaboration between [[Richard O. Mason]] and [[Ian Mitroff]], as an extension of the philosophy on the design of inquiring systems originating from [[C. West Churchman]].  SAST follows the prescriptions of ''dialectic inquiry'', sweeping in multiple perspective onto the full breadth of underlying assumptions to collaborative problem solving and strategic design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Acar | first1 = William | last2 = Druckenmiller | first2 = Douglas A. | year = 2010 | title = Designing Insightful Inquiring Systems for Sustainable Organizational Foresight | url = | journal = Futures | volume = 42 | issue = 4| pages = 405–416 | doi = 10.1016/j.futures.2009.11.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ports as elements in value-driven chain systems: the new paradigm." ''Maritime Policy &amp; Management'' 29.3 (2002): 241-255.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Cost-benefit analysis in language planning" (1971).&lt;ref&gt;Fasold, Ralph W., and Robert Hooke. ''The sociolinguistics of society.'' Vol. 1. Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Uddevalla]], Thorburn obtained his PhD in 1960 at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]] with the thesis, entitled "Supply and demand of water transport: studies in cost and revenue structures of ships, ports and transport buyers with respect to their effects on supply and demand of water carriage of goods." 

After his graduation Thorburn served his academic career at the Stockholm School of Economics, where he was Professor in Business Administration from 1961 to 1978. He was succeeded by [[Nils Brunsson]].

'''Throughput''' is the movement of inputs and outputs through a production process. Without access to and assurance of a supply of inputs, a successful business enterprise would not be possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Besanko, Dranove, Shanley, and Schaefer|title=[[Economics of Strategy]], 5th ed.|year=2010|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is 'Throughput'|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/throughput.asp|website=[[investopedia.com]]|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In the business management [[theory of constraints]], throughput is the rate at which a system achieves its goal. Oftentimes, this is monetary revenue and is in contrast to output, which is inventory that may be sold or stored in a warehouse. In this case, throughput is measured by revenue received (or not) at the point of sale—exactly the right time. Output that becomes part of the [[inventory]] in a warehouse may mislead investors or others about the organizations condition by inflating the apparent value of its assets. The [[theory of constraints]] and [[throughput accounting]] explicitly avoid that trap.

Throughput can be best described as the rate at which a system generates its products or services per unit of time. Businesses often measure their throughput using a mathematical equation known as [[Little's law]], which is related to inventories and [[process time]]: time to fully process a single product.

==Basic formula==
Using [[Little's Law]], one can calculate throughput with the equation:

&lt;math&gt;I=R*T&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*'''''I''''' is the number of units contained within the system, inventory;
*'''''T''''' is the time it takes for all the inventory to go through the process, flow time;
*'''''R''''' is the rate at which the process is delivering throughput, flow rate or throughput.

If you solve for '''''R''''', you will get:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;R=I/T&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Relationship Between Cycle Time and WIP|url=http://www.fabtime.com/ctwip.shtml|publisher=fabtime.com|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Viktor Anatolyevich Bout''' ({{IPAc-en|b|uː|t}}; {{lang-ru|link=no|Ви́ктор Анато́льевич Бут}}; born 13 January 1967) is a [[Russia]]n [[arms dealer]].

Bout, an [[entrepreneur]] and former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military translator, reportedly used his multiple [[air transport]] companies to smuggle weapons since the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of communism]] from [[Eastern Europe]] to [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] during the 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bout FAQ"&gt;[http://www.victorbout.com/FAQ.htm Victor Bout's Personal Website, FAQ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607041502/http://www.victorbout.com/FAQ.htm |date=7 June 2009 }}.

On March 6, 2008, Bout was arrested in [[Thailand]] on [[terrorism]] charges by the [[Royal Thai Police]] in cooperation with American authorities, and the United States ambassador requested his [[extradition]] under the Extradition Act with Thailand, which was eventually mandated by the Thai High Court in August 2010.&lt;ref name="Observer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Interpol1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="extradition"&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/09/01/opinion/Appeal-Court-verdict-on-the-extradition-of-Bout-30136994.html "Appeal Court verdict on the extradition of Bout"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918055728/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/09/01/opinion/Appeal-Court-verdict-on-the-extradition-of-Bout-30136994.html |date=18 September 2010 }}.

===1990s===
According to Bout's personal website, he began his first air freight business, Air Cess, in [[Africa]] around the time of the [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–91)|collapse of the Soviet Union]], operating four [[Antonov An-8]] planes in Angola as it was the only country to allow the An-8 to be used in civilian freight at the time.&lt;ref name="Bout"&gt;[http://www.victorbout.com/ Victor Bout's Personal Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329094156/http://www.victorbout.com/ |date=29 March 2010 }}.

Bout is suspected of supplying weapons to numerous armed groups in Africa in the 2000s, particularly in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] during the [[Second Congo War]], and may have employed some 300 people and operated 40 to 60 aircraft.&lt;ref name="ethz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Current-Affairs/Security-Watch/Detail/?id=88499&amp;lng=en|title=The deadly convenience of Victor Bout|date=24 June 2008|publisher=ETH Zurich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bout's network allegedly delivered [[surface-to-air missile]]s to [[Kenya]] to be used to attack an [[Israel]]i airliner during takeoff in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-14559750_ITM Moi Son's Link to Arms Dealer in UN Ban].

Bout was also reportedly seen meeting with [[Hezbollah]] officials in [[Lebanon]] during the run-up to the [[Hezbollah#2006 Lebanon War|2006 Lebanon War]], while some sources claim he was actually in Russia when the meeting took place.&lt;ref name=de3/&gt; Records found in [[Libyan]] leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s former intelligence headquarters in [[Tripoli]] shortly after the [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|overthrow]] of the [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi government]] in 2011 indicated that in late September 2003, [[MI6|British intelligence]] officials told then-Libyan intelligence chief [[Moussa Koussa|Musa Kusa]] that Bout had a "considerable commercial presence in Libya" and aimed to expand his interests there.&lt;ref name="Libya"&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/khadafy-records-tie-russian-arms-dealer-libya-u-s-experts-hunt-anti-aircraft-missiles-article-1.972724 "Khadafy records tie Russian arms dealer to Libya, U.S. experts hunt for anti-aircraft missiles"] [[Associated Press]], 5 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Bout's strategy of constantly moving location, owning numerous companies, and frequently re-registering aircraft made it hard for authorities to make a case against him, and has never been charged for the alleged African arms deals to which he owes his notoriety.&lt;ref name="Economist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNcopy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 4"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7282576.stm Arms suspect faces charges in US] BBC, Friday, 7 March 2008, 13:36 GMT&lt;/ref&gt; During Bout's reported operations, he is believed to have lived in various countries, including [[Belgium]], Lebanon, [[Rwanda]], Russia, South Africa, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;ref name="ethz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="russian add1"&gt;http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Current-Affairs/Security-Watch/Detail/?id=88500&amp;lng=en ETH Zurich. 24 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=de3&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,721532-4,00.html Trapping the Lord of War, The Rise and Fall of Viktor Bout] Part 4: Hired to Supply U.S. Forces in Iraq. spiegel.de, 6 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.publicintegrity.org/bow/report.aspx?aid=157|title=The Merchant of Death|author=André Verlöy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mensjournal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mensjournal.com/viktor-bout/2|title=Taking Down Arms Dealer Viktor Bout|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325101613/http://www.mensjournal.com/viktor-bout/2|archivedate=25 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Bout was charged in the [[Central African Republic]] with forging documents and was convicted ''[[in absentia]]'', but the charges were later dropped.&lt;ref name="christsci"&gt;[http://features.csmonitor.com/globalnews/2009/10/22/who-is-viktor-bout "Who is Victor Bout?"] ''Global News Blog'' (''The Christian Science Monitor'') by Elizabeth Ryan, 22 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after his Bangkok arrest, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] charged Bout with conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a [[Office of Foreign Assets Control|designated]] foreign terrorist organization,&lt;ref name="DOJ"&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/March/nsd_03062008.html "International Arms Dealer Charged in U.S. with Conspiracy to Provide Surface-to-Air Missiles and other Weapons to a Foreign Terrorist Organization"]. United States Department of Justice.&lt;/ref&gt; conspiring to kill Americans, conspiring to kill American officers or employees, and conspiring to acquire and use an anti-aircraft missile.&lt;ref name="BBC 3"/&gt; Additional charges against him were filed in February 2010.&lt;ref name=news&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/02/17/arms.dealer.charge/index.html "US files new charges against arms dealer Viktor Bout"]. CNN.com, 17 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; These included illegal purchase of aircraft, [[wire fraud]], and [[money laundering]].&lt;ref name=lead1&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100723020721/http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/February10/boutviktoretals1indictmentpr.pdf "U.S. Announces New Indictment Against International Arms Dealer Viktor Bout and American Co-Conspirator for Money Laundering, Wire Fraud, and Conspiracy"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723020721/http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/February10/boutviktoretals1indictmentpr.pdf |date=23 July 2010 }}. PDF, U.S. Indictment released 17 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bout was convicted by a jury at a court in [[Manhattan]] on 2 November 2011.&lt;ref name="AP-11-2-2011" /&gt; On 5 April 2012, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison, the minimum sentence for conspiring to sell weapons to a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist group.&lt;ref name=aljazeera_sentencing/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/news/usa/Russian-Arms-Trafficker-Viktor-Bout-Gets-25-Years-in-US-Prison-146371955.html "Russian Arms Trafficker Viktor Bout Gets 25 Years in US Prison"]. Voice of America, 5 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; District Judge [[Shira Scheindlin]] ruled that the minimum sentence was appropriate because "there was no evidence that Bout would have committed the crimes for which he was convicted had it not been for the [[sting operation]]".&lt;ref name=aljazeera_sentencing/&gt; Russia's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] issued a statement denouncing Bout's sentence as "a political order".&lt;ref name=aljazeera_sentencing/&gt; During the trial, Bout's lawyers also implied that he was a [[political prisoner]].&lt;ref name=aljazeera_sentencing&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2012/04/20124522433245829.html |title=Russian arms dealer gets 25 years in prison |work=Al Jazeera |date=6 April 2012 |accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bout's wife Alla said shortly afterwards that the judge conducted the trial in a proper way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2012_04_09/71131268 |publisher=Voice of Russia (The) |date=9 April 2012 |accessdate=9 April 2012 |title=Alla Bout: husband's trial conducted 'properly' |author=Jessica Jordan &amp; Liudmila Chernova |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411025222/http://english.ruvr.ru/2012_04_09/71131268/ |archivedate=11 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bout himself pointed out that if the same standards were applied to everyone, all American [[gun shop]] owners "who are sending arms and ending up killing Americans" would be in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rt.com/politics/viktor-bout-trial-weapon-233/ |title=Bout: I'm a hunted deer, US wants my head on their trophy-wall |work=[[RT (TV network)|RT]] |date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, a co-conspirator of Bout's, Richard Ammar Chichakli, was extradited to [[New York (state)|New York]] state on charges that he conspired to buy aircraft in violation of economic sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Associate of arms dealer Viktor Bout extradited to New York |author=Chris Francescani |publisher=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/25/us-arms-bout-chichakli-idUSBRE94O00220130525 |date=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York upheld Bout's conviction after rejecting his contention that he had been the victim of a vindictive prosecution and that there was no legitimate [[law enforcement]] reason to prosecute him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout's U.S. conviction upheld |author=Chris Francescani |publisher=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/27/us-usa-crime-bout-idUSBRE98Q0PG20130927 |date=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, former US Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] is representing Bout in overturning his conviction via a new trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stempel|first1=Jonathan|title=Arms dealer Bout seeks new trial, hires Ashcroft law firm|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crime-bout/arms-dealer-bout-seeks-new-trial-hires-ashcroft-law-firm-idUSKCN0JJ20H20141205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
The 2005 film ''[[Lord of War]]'' is purportedly based on allegations about Bout's personal history and black-market activities.&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12795502 "Flying Anything to Anybody"], ''The Economist'', 18 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=de/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7281297.stm "Thailand holds 'top arms dealer'"], BBC, Thursday, 6 March 2008

A documentary about Bout, ''[[The Notorious Mr. Bout]]'', from [[Market Road Films]] and directed by [[Tony Gerber]] and [[Maxim Pozdorovkin]], received its premiere at the 2014 [[Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/sundance-2014-world-cinema-documentary-competition | title=Sundance 2014: World Cinema Documentary Competition | publisher=indiewire.com | work=Indiewire | date=10 January 2014 | accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Stephen Braun and [[Douglas Farah]] published a book about Bout: ''Merchant of Death: Money, Guns, Planes, and the Man Who Makes War Possible''.&lt;ref name=merchant-death-book/&gt;
