      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6356">In [[abstract algebra]], a branch of [[mathematics]], an '''affine monoid''' is a [[commutative]] [[monoid]] that is finitely generated, and is [[isomorphic]] to a submonoid of a [[free abelian group]]  ℤ&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''d''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0.&lt;ref name="Gubeladze"&gt;{{cite book |first=Winfried |last=Bruns |first2=Joseph |last2=Gubeladze |title=Polytopes, Rings, and K-Theory |publisher=Springer |series=Monographs in Mathematics |year=2009 |isbn=0-387-76356-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pbgg1pFxW8YC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Affine monoids are closely connected to [[convex polyhedra]], and their associated [[algebra (ring theory)|algebras]] are of much use in the algebraic study of these geometric objects.

== Characterization ==
* Affine monoids are '''finitely generated'''. This means for a monoid &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt; m_1, \dots , m_n \in M &lt;/math&gt; such that  
:&lt;math&gt; M = m_1\mathbb{Z_+}+\dots + m_n\mathbb{Z_+} &lt;/math&gt;.

* Affine monoids are '''[[cancellation property|cancellative]]'''. In other words, 
:&lt;math&gt;x + y = x + z&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;y = z&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x,y,z \in M&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[binary operation]] on the affine monoid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

* Affine monoids are also '''[[Affine connection|torsion free]]'''. For an affine monoid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;nx = ny&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; x, y \in M&lt;/math&gt;.
* A subset &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of a monoid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; that is itself a monoid with respect to the operation on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a '''submonoid''' of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Properties and examples ===
* Every submonoid of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is finitely generated. Hence, ''every'' submonoid of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is affine.
* The submonoid &lt;math&gt;\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \mid y &gt; 0\} \cup \{(0,0)\}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' finitely generated, and therefore ''not'' affine.
* The [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of two affine monoids is an affine monoid.

== Affine monoids ==

=== Group of differences ===
:If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is an affine monoid, it can be [[embedding|embedded]] into a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. More specifically, there is a unique group &lt;math&gt;gp(M)&lt;/math&gt;, called ''the group of differences'', in which &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; can be embedded.

==== Definition ====
*&lt;math&gt;gp(M)&lt;/math&gt; can be viewed as the set of equivalences classes &lt;math&gt;x - y&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x - y = u - v&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x + v + z = u + y + z&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;z \in M&lt;/math&gt;, and 
&lt;math&gt;(x-y) + (u-v) = (x+u) - (y+v)&lt;/math&gt; defines the addition.&lt;ref name="Gubeladze" /&gt;

*The '''rank''' of an affine monoid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[rank of a group]] of &lt;math&gt;gp(M)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Gubeladze" /&gt;
*If an affine monoid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is given as a submonoid of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^r&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;gp(M) \cong \mathbb{Z}M&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}M&lt;/math&gt; is the subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^r&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Gubeladze" /&gt;

==== Universal property ====

*If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is an affine monoid, then the monoid [[homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\iota : M \to gp(M)&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;\iota(x) = x + 0&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the following [[universal property]]:

:for any monoid homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi: M \to G&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a group, there is a unique group homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\psi : gp(M) \to G&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi = \psi \circ \iota&lt;/math&gt;, and since affine monoids are cancellative, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt; is an embedding. In other words, ''every'' affine monoid can be embedded into a group.

=== Normal affine monoids ===

==== Definition ====
* If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a submonoid of an affine monoid &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, then the submonoid
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{M}_N = \{x\in N \mid mx \in M, m \in \mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt;
is the '''integral closure''' of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;M = \hat{M_N}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is '''integrally closed'''
*The '''normalization''' of an affine monoid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the integral closure of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;gp(M)&lt;/math&gt;. If the normalization of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, is &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; itself, then &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a '''normal''' affine monoid.&lt;ref name="Gubeladze" /&gt;
* A monoid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a normal affine monoid if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}_+M&lt;/math&gt; is finitely generated and &lt;math&gt;M = \mathbb{Z}^r \cap \mathbb{R}_+M&lt;/math&gt; .

== Affine monoid rings ==
: ''see also: [[Group ring]]''

=== Definition ===

* Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be an affine monoid, and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; a commutative [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. Then one can form the '''affine monoid ring''' &lt;math&gt;R[M]&lt;/math&gt;. This is an &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module with a free basis &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, so if &lt;math&gt;f \in R[M]&lt;/math&gt;, then 
: &lt;math&gt;f = \sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}x_i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f_i \in R, x_i \in M&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. 
:In other words, &lt;math&gt;R[M]&lt;/math&gt; is the set of finite sums of elements of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; with coefficients in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

== Connection to [[convex geometry]] ==
:Affine monoids arise naturally from convex polyhedra, [[convex cone]]s, and their associated discrete structures.

* Let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be a rational [[convex cone]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be a [[lattice (group)|lattice]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;C \cap L&lt;/math&gt; is an affine monoid.&lt;ref name="Gubeladze" /&gt; (Lemma 2.9, Gordan's lemma)
* If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a submonoid of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}_+M&lt;/math&gt; is a cone if and only if &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is an affine monoid.
* If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a submonoid of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a cone generated by the elements of &lt;math&gt;gp(M)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;M \cap C&lt;/math&gt; is an affine monoid.
* Let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; be a rational polyhedron, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; the [[recession cone]] of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; a lattice in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;P \cap L&lt;/math&gt; is a finitely generated [[module (mathematics)|module]] over the affine monoid &lt;math&gt;C \cap L&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Gubeladze" /&gt; (Theorem 2.12)

==Etymology==
The word ''Ahimsa''—sometimes spelled as ''Ahinsa''&lt;ref name="Sanskrit dictionary"&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0125-ahalyA.jpg Sanskrit dictionary reference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Standing, E. M. (1924). THE SUPER‐VEGETARIANS. New Blackfriars, 5(50), pages 103–108&lt;/ref&gt;—is derived from the Sanskrit root ''hiṃs'' – to strike; ''hiṃsā'' is injury or harm, ''a-hiṃsā'' is the opposite of this, i.e. ''non harming'' or ''[[nonviolence]]''.&lt;ref name="Sanskrit dictionary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shukavak N. Dasa"&gt;[http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Primer/nonharming_ahimsa.html A Hindu Primer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408135457/http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Primer/nonharming_ahimsa.html |date=8 April 2011 }}, by [http://www.sanskrit.org/www/shukavak.htm Shukavak N. Dasa]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonviolence or ''Ahimsa'' is one of the cardinal virtues&lt;ref name=evpc/&gt; and an important tenet of [[Jainism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]]. It is a multidimensional concept,&lt;ref name=arapura&gt;John Arapura in K. R. Sundararajan and Bithika Mukerji Ed. (1997), Hindu spirituality: Postclassical and modern, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1937-5}}; see Chapter 20, pages 392–417&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. It has also been related to the notion that any violence has [[Karma|karmic]] consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and over time perfected the principles of ''Ahimsa'', the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism.&lt;ref name=evpc&gt;Stephen H. Phillips &amp; other authors (2008), in Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, &amp; Conflict (Second Edition), {{ISBN|978-0-12-373985-8}}, Elsevier Science, Pages 1347–1356, 701–849, 1867&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chapple1990&gt;Chapple, C. (1990). Nonviolence to animals, earth and self in Asian Traditions (see Chapter 1). State University of New York Press (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parsvanatha]], the twenty-third ''[[tirthankara]]'' of Jainism, revived,  advocated for and preached the concept of nonviolence in around eighth-century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Parshvanatha |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Parshvanatha |work=britannica.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mahavira]], the twenty-fourth and the last ''tirthankara'' further strengthened the idea in sixth-century BC; which was believed to be founded by the first tirthankara [[Rishabhanatha|Rushabhdev]] over a million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Mahavira |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mahavira-Jaina-teacher |work=britannica.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=SXgEfiNY46sC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=Rushabhdev+million&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwin-beChPTZAhVELI8KHaB5AD0Q6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Rushabhdev%20million&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==

===Ancient Vedic texts===
Ahimsa as an ethical concept evolved in Vedic texts.&lt;ref name=chapple1990/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walli, Koshelya: ''The Conception of Ahimsa in Indian Thought'', Varanasi 1974, p. 113–145.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest scripts indirectly mention Ahimsa, but do not emphasise it. Over time, the Hindu scripts revise ritual practices and the concept of Ahimsa is increasingly refined and emphasised, ultimately Ahimsa becomes the highest virtue by the late Vedic era (about 500 BC). For example, hymn 10.22.25 in the Rig Veda uses the words [[Satya]] (truthfulness) and Ahimsa in a prayer to deity Indra;&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit: अस्मे ता त इन्द्र सन्तु '''सत्याहिंस'''न्तीरुपस्पृशः । विद्याम यासां भुजो धेनूनां न वज्रिवः ॥१३॥ [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.२२ Rigveda 10.22] Wikisource;&lt;br&gt;English: Unto Tähtinen (1964), Non-violence as an Ethical Principle, Turun Yliopisto, Finland, PhD Thesis, pages 23–25; {{oclc|4288274}};&lt;br&gt;For other occurrence of Ahimsa in Rigveda, see [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_५.६४ Rigveda 5.64.3], [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१.१४१ Rigveda 1.141.5];&lt;/ref&gt; later, the [[Yajurveda|Yajur Veda]] dated to be between 1000 BC and 600 BC, states, "may all beings look at me with a friendly eye, may I do likewise, and may we look at each other with the eyes of a friend".&lt;ref name=chapple1990/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/himalayanacademy/sacredhinduliterature/lws/lws_ch-39.html To do no harm] Project Gutenberg, see translation for Yajurveda 36.18 VE;&lt;br&gt;For other occurrences of Ahimsa in Vedic literature, see [https://archive.org/stream/vedicconcordance00bloouoft#page/150/mode/2up A Vedic Concordance] [[Maurice Bloomfield]], Harvard University Press, page 151&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Ahimsa'' appears in the text [[Taittiriya Shakha]] of the [[Yajurveda]] (TS 5.2.8.7), where it refers to non-injury to the sacrificer himself.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs several times in the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'' in the sense of "non-injury".&lt;ref&gt;Shatapatha Brahmana 2.3.4.30; 2.5.1.14; 6.3.1.26; 6.3.1.39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ahimsa doctrine is a late Vedic era development in Brahmanical culture.&lt;ref name="houben 1999"&gt;Henk M. Bodewitz in Jan E. M. Houben, K. R. van Kooij, ed., ''Violence denied: violence, non-violence and the rationalisation of violence in "South Asian" cultural history.'' BRILL, 1999 page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to the idea of non-violence to animals ("pashu-Ahimsa"), apparently in a moral sense, is in the Kapisthala Katha Samhita of the Yajurveda (KapS 31.11), which may have been written in about the 8th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowker states the word appears but is uncommon in the principal Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowker, ''Problems of suffering in religions of the world.'' Cambridge University Press, 1975, page 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaneda gives examples of the word ''Ahimsa'' in these Upanishads.&lt;ref name=kaneda2008&gt;Kaneda, T. (2008). Shanti, peacefulness of mind. C.

Empathy for Pain in Vedic Ritual. Journal of the International College for Advanced Buddhist Studies, 12, 78&lt;/ref&gt; suggest ''Ahimsa'' as an ethical concept that started evolving in the Vedas, becoming an increasingly central concept in Upanishads.

The [[Chāndogya Upaniṣad]], dated to the 8th or 7th century BCE, one of the oldest [[Upanishads]], has the earliest evidence for the [[Vedas|Vedic era]] use of the word ''Ahimsa'' in the sense familiar in Hinduism (a code of conduct). It bars violence against "all creatures" (''sarvabhuta'') and the practitioner of Ahimsa is said to escape from the cycle of [[Reincarnation|rebirths]] (CU 8.15.1).&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 2–5; English translation: Schmidt p. 631.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars state that this 8th or 7th-century BCE mention may have been an influence of Jainism on Vedic Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;M.K Sridhar and Puruṣottama Bilimoria (2007), ''Indian Ethics: Classical traditions and contemporary challenges,'' Editors: Puruṣottama Bilimoria, Joseph Prabhu, Renuka M. Sharma, Ashgate Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-3301-3}}, page 315&lt;/ref&gt; Others scholar state that this relationship is speculative, and though Jainism is an ancient tradition the oldest traceable texts of Jainism tradition are from many centuries after the Vedic era ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D. Long|title=Jainism: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JmRlAgAAQBAJ|year=2009|publisher=I. B.

Chāndogya Upaniṣad also names Ahimsa, along with Satyavacanam (truthfulness), Arjavam (sincerity), [[Dāna|Danam]] (charity), [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapo]] (penance/meditation), as one of five essential virtues (CU 3.17.4).&lt;ref name=arapura/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravindra Kumar (2008), Non-violence and Its Philosophy, {{ISBN|978-81-7933-159-0}}, see page 11–14&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sandilya [[Upanishad]] lists ten forbearances: ''Ahimsa'', ''Satya'', ''Asteya'', ''Brahmacharya'', ''Daya'', ''Arjava'', ''Kshama'', ''Dhriti'', ''Mitahara'' and ''Saucha''.&lt;ref&gt;Swami, P. (2000). Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Upaniṣads: SZ (Vol. 3). Sarup &amp; Sons; see pages 630–631&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ballantyne, J. R., &amp; Yogīndra, S. (1850). A Lecture on the Vedánta: Embracing the Text of the Vedánta-sára. Presbyterian mission press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kaneda,&lt;ref name=kaneda2008/&gt; the term Ahimsa is an important spiritual doctrine shared by Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. It literally means 'non-injury' and 'non-killing'. It implies the total avoidance of harming of any kind of living creatures not only by deeds, but also by words and in thoughts.

===The Epics===
The [[Mahabharata]], one of the epics of Hinduism, has multiple mentions of the phrase ''Ahimsa Paramo Dharma'' (अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मः), which literally means: non-violence is the highest moral virtue. For example, [[Mahaprasthanika Parva]] has the verse:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/mbs/mbs13117.htm Mahabharata 13.117.37–38]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मस तथाहिंसा परॊ दमः।
अहिंसा परमं दानम अहिंसा परमस तपः।
अहिंसा परमॊ यज्ञस तथाहिस्मा परं बलम।
अहिंसा परमं मित्रम अहिंसा परमं सुखम।
अहिंसा परमं सत्यम अहिंसा परमं शरुतम॥
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The above passage from Mahabharata emphasises the cardinal importance of Ahimsa in Hinduism, and literally means:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Ahimsa is the highest [[virtue]], Ahimsa is the highest self-control, 
Ahimsa is the greatest gift, Ahimsa is the best suffering, 
Ahimsa is the highest sacrifice, Ahimsa is the finest strength, 
Ahimsa is the greatest friend, Ahimsa is the greatest happiness, 
Ahimsa is the highest truth, and Ahimsa is the greatest teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Chapple, C. (1990). Ecological Nonviolence and the Hindu Tradition. In Perspectives on Nonviolence (pp. 168–177). Springer New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/pdf_downloads/what_is_hinduism/Sec6/WIH_Sec6_Chapter45.pdf Ahimsa: To do no harm] Subramuniyaswami, What is Hinduism?, Chapter 45, Pages 359–361&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some other examples where the phrase ''Ahimsa Paramo Dharma'' are discussed include [[Adi Parva]], [[Vana Parva]] and [[Anushasana Parva]]. The [[Bhagavad Gita]], among other things, discusses the doubts and questions about appropriate response when one faces systematic violence or war. These verses develop the concepts of lawful violence in self-defence and the [[Just war theory|theories of just war]]. However, there is no consensus on this interpretation. Gandhi, for example, considers this debate about non-violence and lawful violence as a mere metaphor for the internal war within each human being, when he or she faces moral questions.&lt;ref name=fischer1954/&gt;

===Self-defence, criminal law, and war===
The classical texts of Hinduism devote numerous chapters discussing what people who practice the virtue of Ahimsa, can and must do when they are faced with war, violent threat or need to sentence someone convicted of a crime. These discussions have led to theories of just war, theories of reasonable self-defence and theories of proportionate punishment.&lt;ref name=balkaran2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=klos1996&gt;[[Klaus K. Klostermaier]] (1996), in Harvey Leonard Dyck and Peter Brock (Ed), The Pacifist Impulse in Historical Perspective, see ''Chapter on Himsa and Ahimsa Traditions in Hinduism'', {{ISBN|978-0-8020-0777-3}}, University of Toronto Press, pages 230–234&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthashastra]] discusses, among other things, why and what constitutes proportionate response and punishment.&lt;ref name=robinson2003&gt;Paul F. Robinson (2003), Just War in Comparative Perspective, {{ISBN|0-7546-3587-2}}, Ashgate Publishing, see pages 114–125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coates, B. E. (2008). Modern India's Strategic Advantage to the United States: Her Twin Strengths in Himsa and Ahimsa. Comparative Strategy, 27(2), pages 133–147&lt;/ref&gt;

;War
The precepts of Ahimsa under Hinduism require that war must be avoided, with sincere and truthful dialogue. Force must be the last resort. If war becomes necessary, its cause must be just, its purpose virtuous, its objective to restrain the wicked, its aim peace, its method lawful.&lt;ref name=balkaran2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=robinson2003/&gt; War can only be started and stopped by a legitimate authority. Weapons used must be proportionate to the opponent and the aim of war, not indiscriminate tools of destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Subedi, S. P. (2003). The Concept in Hinduism of 'Just War'. Journal of Conflict and Security Law, 8(2), pages 339–361&lt;/ref&gt; All strategies and weapons used in the war must be to defeat the opponent, not designed to cause misery to the opponent; for example, use of arrows is allowed, but use of arrows smeared with painful poison is not allowed. Warriors must use judgment in the battlefield. Cruelty to the opponent during war is forbidden. Wounded, unarmed opponent warriors must not be attacked or killed, they must be brought to your realm and given medical treatment.&lt;ref name=robinson2003/&gt; Children, women and civilians must not be injured. While the war is in progress, sincere dialogue for peace must continue.&lt;ref name=balkaran2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=klos1996/&gt;

;Self-defence
In matters of self-defence, different interpretations of ancient Hindu texts have been offered. For example, Tähtinen suggests self-defence is appropriate, criminals are not protected by the rule of Ahimsa, and Hindu scriptures support the use of violence against an armed attacker.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 96, 98–101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 12.15.55; Manu Smriti 8.349–350; Matsya Purana 226.116.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa is not meant to imply pacifism.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 91–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternate theories of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to theories of just war. [[Aikido]], pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. [[Morihei Ueshiba]], the founder of Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportspa.com.ba/images/dec2011/full/rad8.pdf The Role of Teachers in Martial Arts] Nebojša Vasic, University of Zenica (2011); Sport SPA Vol. 8, Issue 2: 47–51; see page 46, 2nd column&lt;/ref&gt; According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume that the world is free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aiki-extensions.org/pubs/conflict-body_text.pdf SOCIAL CONFLICT, AGGRESSION, AND THE BODY IN EURO-AMERICAN AND ASIAN SOCIAL THOUGHT] Donald Levine, University of Chicago (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ueshiba, Kisshōmaru (2004), ''The Art of Aikido: Principles and Essential Techniques'', Kodansha International, {{ISBN|4-7700-2945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Criminal law
Tähtinen concludes that Hindus have no misgivings about death penalty; their position is that evil-doers who deserve death should be killed, and that a king in particular is obliged to punish criminals and should not hesitate to kill them, even if they happen to be his own brothers and sons.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 96, 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars&lt;ref name=klos1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=robinson2003/&gt; conclude that the scriptures of Hinduism suggest sentences for any crime must be fair, proportional and not cruel.

;Pacifism
There is no consensus on [[pacifism]] among modern Hindu scholars. The conflict between pacifistic interpretations of Ahimsa and the theories of [[just war]] prescribed by the Gita has been resolved by some scholars such as [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], as being an allegory,&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, Mohandas K., ''The Bhagavad Gita According to Gandhi'' Berkeley Hills Books, Berkeley 2000&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the battlefield is the soul and Arjuna, the war is within each human being, where human's higher impulses struggle against his own evil impulses.&lt;ref name=fischer1954&gt;Fischer, Louis: ''Gandhi: His Life and Message to the World'' Mentor, New York 1954, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-human life===
The Hindu precept of 'cause no injury' applies to animals and all life forms. This precept isn't found in the oldest verses of Vedas, but increasingly becomes one of the central ideas between 500 BC and 400 AD.&lt;ref name=chapple16&gt;Christopher Chapple (1993), Nonviolence to Animals, Earth, and Self in Asian Traditions, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-1498-1}}, pages 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W Norman Brown (February 1964), [http://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/1964_16/5-6-7/the_sanctity_of_the_cow_in_hinduism.pdf ''The sanctity of the cow in Hinduism''], The Economic Weekly, pages 245–255&lt;/ref&gt; In the oldest texts, numerous ritual sacrifices of animals, including cows and horses, are highlighted and hardly any mention is made of Ahimsa to non-human life.&lt;ref&gt;D.N. Jha (2002), ''The Myth of the Holy Cow'', {{ISBN|1-85984-676-9}}, Verso&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Rosen (2004), Holy Cow: The Hare Krishna Contribution to Vegetarianism and Animal Rights, {{ISBN|1-59056-066-3}}, pages 19–39&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu texts dated to 1st millennium BC, initially mention meat as food, then evolve to suggestions that only meat obtained through ritual sacrifice can be eaten, thereafter evolving to the stance that one should eat no meat because it hurts animals, with verses describing the noble life as one that lives on flowers, roots and fruits alone.&lt;ref name=chapple16/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Baudhayana]] Dharmasutra 2.4.7; 2.6.2; 2.11.15; 2.12.8; 3.1.13; 3.3.6; [[Apastamba]] Dharmasutra 1.17.15; 1.17.19; 2.17.26–2.18.3; Vasistha Dharmasutra 14.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later texts of Hinduism declare Ahimsa one of the primary virtues, declare any killing or harming any life as against ''dharma'' (moral life). Finally, the discussion in Upanishads and Hindu Epics&lt;ref&gt;Manu Smriti 5.30, 5.32, 5.39 and 5.44; Mahabharata 3.199 (3.207), 3.199.5 (3.207.5), 3.199.19–29 (3.207.19), 3.199.23–24 (3.207.23–24), 13.116.15–18, 14.28; Ramayana 1-2-8:19&lt;/ref&gt; shifts to whether a human being can ever live his or her life without harming animal and plant life in some way; which and when plants or animal meat may be eaten, whether violence against animals causes human beings to become less compassionate, and if and how one may exert least harm to non-human life consistent with ahimsa precept, given the constraints of life and human needs.&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf pp. 592–593.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 13.115.59–60; 13.116.15–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahabharata permits hunting by warriors, but opposes it in the case of hermits who must be strictly non-violent. [[Sushruta Samhita]], a Hindu text written in the 3rd or 4th century, in Chapter XLVI suggests proper diet as a means of treating certain illnesses, and recommends various fishes and meats for different ailments and for pregnant women,&lt;ref&gt;Kaviraj Kunja Lal Bhishagratna (1907), An English Translation of the Sushruta Samhita, Volume I, Part 2; see Chapter starting on page 469; for discussion on meats and fishes, see page 480 and onwards&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutrasthana 46.89; Sharirasthana 3.25.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Charaka Samhita]] describes meat as superior to all other kinds of food for convalescents.&lt;ref&gt;Sutrasthana 27.87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Across the texts of Hinduism, there is a profusion of ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to non-human life, but without a universal consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 3.199.11–12 (3.199 is 3.207 elsewhere); 13.115; 13.116.26; 13.148.17; Bhagavata Purana (11.5.13–14), and the Chandogya Upanishad (8.15.1).&lt;/ref&gt; Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf pp. 572–577 (for the Manusmṛti) and pp. 585–597 (for the Mahabharata); Tähtinen pp. 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mahabharata and the Manusmṛti (5.27–55) contain lengthy discussions about the legitimacy of ritual slaughter.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12b095.htm Mahabharata 12.260] (12.260 is 12.268 according to another count); 13.115–116; 14.28.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03207.htm Mahabharata 3.199] (3.199 is 3.207 according to another count).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the arguments proposed in favor of non-violence to animals refer to the bliss one feels, the rewards it entails before or after death, the danger and harm it prevents, as well as to the karmic consequences of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 39–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf p. 589–590; Schmidt pp. 634–635, 640–643; Tähtinen pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Hindu texts discuss Ahimsa and non-animal life. They discourage wanton destruction of nature including of wild and cultivated plants. Hermits ([[sannyasa|sannyasin]]s) were urged to live on a [[fruitarian]] diet so as to avoid the destruction of plants.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt pp. 637–639; Manusmriti 10.63, 11.145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rod Preece, Animals and Nature: Cultural Myths, Cultural Realities, {{ISBN|978-0-7748-0725-8}}, University of British Columbia Press, pages 212–217&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars&lt;ref&gt;Chapple, C. (1990). Ecological Nonviolence and the Hindu Tradition. In ''Perspectives on Nonviolence'' (pages 168–177). Springer New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Horn, G. (2006). Hindu Traditions and Nature: Survey Article. Worldviews: Global Religions, Culture, and Ecology, 10(1), 5–39&lt;/ref&gt; claim the principles of ecological non-violence is innate in the Hindu tradition, and its conceptual fountain has been Ahimsa as their cardinal virtue.

The classical literature of Hinduism exists in many Indian languages. For example, the ''[[Tirukkural]],'' written between 200 BC and 400 AD, and sometimes called the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Veda]], is one of the most cherished classics on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. The Kural dedicates Chapters 26, 32 and 33 of [[Aram (Kural book)|Book I]] to the virtue of Ahimsa, namely, [[vegetarianism]], [[non-violence|non-harming]], and [[non-killing]], respectively. The Kural says that Ahimsa applies to all life forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf Tirukkural] Translated by Rev G.U. Pope, Rev W.H.

===Modern times===
[[File:Portrait Gandhi.jpg|thumb|[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]] promoted the principle of Ahimsa very successfully by applying it to all spheres of life, particularly to politics.]]

In the 19th and 20th centuries, prominent figures of Indian spirituality such as [[Shrimad Rajchandra|Shrimad Rajchandraji]]&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=8P0KAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=shrimad+rajchandra+and+gandhiji&amp;dq=shrimad+rajchandra+and+gandhiji&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_7uC9uMjaAhVLqY8KHU3wAbYQ6AEIPTAF &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Swami Vivekananda]]&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Vegetarianism'', ed. [[Kerry S. Walters]] and Lisa Portmess, Albany 2001, p. 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasised the importance of Ahimsa.

[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] promoted the principle of Ahimsa, very successful by applying it to all spheres of life, particularly to politics ([[Swaraj]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 116–124.&lt;/ref&gt; His non-violent resistance movement [[satyagraha]] had an immense impact on India, impressed public opinion in Western countries, and influenced the leaders of various [[civil and political rights]] movements such as the American civil rights movement's [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[James Bevel]]. In Gandhi's thought, Ahimsa precludes not only the act of inflicting a physical injury, but also mental states like evil thoughts and hatred, unkind behavior such as harsh words, dishonesty and lying, all of which he saw as manifestations of violence incompatible with Ahimsa.&lt;ref name="XXII-XLVII 1986, p. 11-12"&gt;Walli pp. XXII-XLVII; Borman, William: ''Gandhi and Non-Violence'', Albany 1986, p. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi believed Ahimsa to be a creative energy force, encompassing all interactions leading one's self to find satya, "Divine Truth".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson pp. 39–54. Religion East &amp; West. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sri Aurobindo]] criticised the Gandhian concept of Ahimsa as unrealistic and not universally applicable; he adopted a pragmatic non-pacifist position, saying that the justification of violence depends on the specific circumstances of the given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gandhi stated that he viewed "Ahimsa is in Hinduism, it is in Christianity as well as in Islam."&lt;ref name=par/&gt; He added, "Nonviolence is common to all religions, but it has found the highest expression and application in Hinduism (I do not regard Jainism or Buddhism as separate from Hinduism)."&lt;ref name=par/&gt; When questioned whether violence and non-violence is both taught in Quran, he stated, "I have heard it from many Muslim friends that the Koran teaches the use of non-violence. (...&amp;nbsp;The) argument about non-violence in the Holy Koran is an interpolation, not necessary for my thesis."&lt;ref name=par&gt;Prabhu and Rao (1966), [http://gandhiashramsevagram.org/pdf-books/mind-of-mahatma-gandhi.pdf The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi], Encyclopedia of Gandhi's Thoughts, p. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mgarat&gt;Gandhi, Mahatma. 1962.

Indira Gandhi Centre for Indian Culture &amp; Mahatma Gandhi Institute. p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

A historical and philosophical study of Ahimsa was instrumental in the shaping of [[Albert Schweitzer]]'s principle of "reverence for life". Schweitzer praised Indian philosophical and religious traditions for ethics of Ahimsa as, "the laying down of the commandment not to kill and not to damage is one of the greatest events in the spiritual history of humankind", but suggested that "not-killing and not-harming" is not always practically possible as in self-defence, nor ethical as in chronic starving during a famine case.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, Albert: [https://archive.org/stream/indianthoughtsan027860mbp#page/n95/mode/2up Indian Thought and its Development], London 1956, pages 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoga===
Ahimsa is imperative for practitioners of [[Patañjali]]'s eight limb [[Raja yoga]] system. It is included in the first limb and is the first of five [[Yamas]] (self restraints) which, together with the second limb, make up the code of ethical conduct in Yoga philosophy.&lt;ref name=pyogas3t&gt;

On Âsanas] THE HAṬHA YOGA PRADIPIKA&lt;/ref&gt;
The significance of Ahimsa as the very first restraint in the very first limb of Yoga (Yamas), is that it defines the necessary foundation for progress through Yoga. It is a precursor to Asana, implying that success in Yogasana can be had only if the self is purified in [[Manasa, vacha, karmana|thought, word and deed]] through the self-restraint of Ahimsa.

In Jainism, the understanding and implementation of ''Ahimsā'' is more radical, scrupulous, and comprehensive than in any other religion.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw, pp. 154–160; Jindal, pp. 74–90; Tähtinen p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Killing any living being out of passions is considered ''hiṃsā'' (to injure) and abstaining from such an act is ''ahimsā'' (noninjury).{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=34}} The vow of ahimsā is considered the foremost among the 'five vows of Jainism'. Other vows like truth (satya) are meant for safeguarding the vow of ahimsā.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=33}} In the practice of Ahimsa, the requirements are less strict for the lay persons ([[sravakas]]) who have undertaken ''anuvrata'' (Smaller Vows) than for the [[Jain monasticism|Jain monastics]] who are bound by the [[Mahavrata]] "Great Vows".&lt;ref&gt;Dundas pp. 158–159, 189–192; Laidlaw pp. 173–175, 179; ''Religious Vegetarianism'', ed. [[Kerry S. Walters]] and Lisa Portmess, Albany 2001, p. 43–46 (translation of the First Great Vow).&lt;/ref&gt; The statement ''{{IAST|ahimsā paramo dharmaḥ}}'' is often found inscribed on the walls of the [[Jain temple]]s.&lt;ref name=pauldundas160&gt;Dundas, Paul: ''The Jains'', second edition, London 2002, p. 160; Wiley, Kristi L.: ''Ahimsa and Compassion in Jainism'', in: ''Studies in Jaina History and Culture'', ed. Peter Flügel, London 2006, p. 438; Laidlaw pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt; Like in Hinduism, the aim is to prevent the accumulation of harmful karma.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw pp. 26–30, 191–195.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Mahavira]] revived and reorganised the Jain faith in the 6th or 5th century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Dundas p. 24 suggests the 5th century; the traditional dating of Mahavira's death is 527 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa was already an established, strictly observed rule.&lt;ref&gt;Goyal, S.R.: ''A History of Indian Buddhism'', Meerut 1987, p. 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rishabhanatha]] (Ādinātha), the first Jain [[Tirthankara]], whom modern Western historians consider to be a historical figure, followed by [[Parshvanatha]] (Pārśvanātha)&lt;ref&gt;Dundas pp. 19, 30; Tähtinen p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; the twenty-third [[Tirthankara]] lived in about the 8th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas p. 30 suggests the 8th or 7th century; the traditional chronology places him in the late 9th or early 8th century.&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the community to which Mahavira's parents belonged.&lt;ref&gt;[[Acaranga Sutra]] 2.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa was already part of the "Fourfold Restraint" (''Caujjama''), the vows taken by Parshva's followers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sthananga Sutra]] 266; Tähtinen p. 132; Goyal p. 83–84, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; In the times of Mahavira and in the following centuries, Jains were at odds with both Buddhists and followers of the Vedic religion or Hindus, whom they accused of negligence and inconsistency in the implementation of Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas pp. 160, 234, 241; Wiley p. 448; Granoff, Phyllis: ''The Violence of Non-Violence: A Study of Some Jain Responses to Non-Jain Religious Practices'', in: ''Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies'' 15 (1992) pp. 1–43; Tähtinen pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Jain tradition either [[lacto vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]] is mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain concept of Ahimsa is characterised by several aspects. It does not make any exception for ritual sacrificers and professional warrior-hunters. Killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw pp. 166–167; Tähtinen p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Though they admit that plants must be destroyed for the sake of food, they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants.&lt;ref&gt;Lodha, R.M.: ''Conservation of Vegetation and Jain Philosophy'', in: ''Medieval Jainism: Culture and Environment'', New Delhi 1990, p. 137–141; Tähtinen p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Jains go out of their way so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals.&lt;ref&gt;Jindal p. 89; Laidlaw pp. 54, 154–155, 180.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jains often do not go out at night, when they are more likely to step upon an insect. In their view, injury caused by carelessness is like injury caused by deliberate action.&lt;ref&gt;Sutrakrtangasutram 1.8.3; Uttaradhyayanasutra 10; Tattvarthasutra 7.8; Dundas pp. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt; Eating honey is strictly outlawed, as it would amount to violence against the bees.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hemacandra]]: ''Yogashastra'' 3.37; Laidlaw pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals, such as worms and insects,&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; but agriculture is not forbidden in general and there are Jain farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Sangave, Vilas Adinath: ''Jaina Community. A Social Survey'', second edition, Bombay 1980, p. 259; Dundas p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretically, all life forms are said to deserve full protection from all kinds of injury, but Jains recognise a hierarchy of life. Mobile beings are given higher protection than immobile ones. For the mobile beings, they distinguish between one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed and five-sensed ones; a one-sensed animal has touch as its only sensory modality. The more senses a being has, the more they care about non-injuring it. Among the five-sensed beings, the precept of non-injury and non-violence to the rational ones (humans) is strongest in Jain Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Jindal pp. 89, 125–133 (detailed exposition of the classification system); Tähtinen pp. 17, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jain theology, it does not matter how correct or defensible the violence may be, one must not kill any being, and "non-violence is one's highest religious duty".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=160}}{{sfn|Markham|Lohr|2009|p=71}}

[[Mahatma Gandhi]], who was greatly influenced by Jainism, said:{{sfn|Rudolph|Rudolph|1984|p=171}}
{{quote|No religion in the World has explained the principle of ''Ahiṃsā'' so deeply and systematically as is discussed with its applicability in every human life in Jainism. As and when the benevolent principle of ''Ahiṃsā'' or non-violence will be ascribed for practice by the people of the world to achieve their end of life in this world and beyond, Jainism is sure to have the uppermost status and Mahāvīra is sure to be respected as the greatest authority on ''Ahiṃsā''.{{cn|date=November 2018}}}}

==Buddhism==
&lt;!--"Buddhist devotion#Chanting" is linking here.--&gt;
{{further information|Noble Eightfold Path|Buddhist ethics#Killing, causing others to kill|Buddhism and violence|Engaged Buddhism}}
In Buddhist texts ''Ahimsa'' (or its [[Pāli]] cognate {{IAST|avihiṃsā}}) is part of the [[Five Precepts]] ({{IAST|Pañcasīla}}), the first of which has been to abstain from killing. This precept of Ahimsa is applicable to both the Buddhist layperson and the monk community.&lt;ref name="Williams2005p398"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams |title=Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgrZnmKUKtgC |year=2005|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-33226-2 |page=398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bodhi Bhikkhu|title=Great Disciples of the Buddha: Their Lives, Their Works, Their Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teUGAAAAYAAJ |year=1997|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-128-4 |pages=387 with footnote 12}};&lt;br&gt;Sarao, p. 49; Goyal p. 143; Tähtinen p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamotte, Etienne 1988, p. 54-55"&gt;Lamotte, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ahimsa precept is not a commandment and transgressions did not invite religious sanctions for laypersons, but their power has been in the Buddhist belief in karmic consequences and their impact in afterlife during rebirth.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=187}} Killing, in Buddhist belief, could lead to rebirth in the hellish realm, and for a longer time in more severe conditions if the murder victim was a monk.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=187}} Saving animals from slaughter for meat is believed to be a way to acquire merit for better rebirth. These moral precepts have been voluntarily self-enforced in lay Buddhist culture through the associated belief in karma and rebirth.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|pp=187–191}} The Buddhist texts not only recommended Ahimsa, but suggest avoiding trading goods that contribute to or are a result of violence:

{{Quote|
These five trades, O monks, should not be taken up by a lay follower: trading with weapons, trading in living beings, trading in meat, trading in intoxicants, trading in poison.
|Anguttara Nikaya V.177|Translated by Martine Batchelor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martine Batchelor|title=The Spirit of the Buddha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fL3mykqlOJcC&amp;pg=PT59 |year=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-17500-4 |page=59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Unlike lay Buddhists, transgressions by monks do invite sanctions.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=192}} Full expulsion of a monk from ''sangha'' follows instances of killing, just like any other serious offense against the monastic ''nikaya'' code of conduct.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=192}}

===War===
Violent ways of punishing criminals and prisoners of war was not explicitly condemned in Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;Sarao p. 53; Tähtinen pp. 95, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; but peaceful ways of conflict resolution and punishment with the least amount of injury were encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 95, 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt A. Raaflaub, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FMxgef2VJEwC&amp;pg=PA61 ''War and Peace in the Ancient World.''] Blackwell Publishing, 2007, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The early texts condemn the mental states that lead to violent behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonviolence is an overriding theme within the [[Pali Canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; While the early texts condemn killing in the strongest terms, and portray the ideal queen/king as a pacifist, such a queen/king is nonetheless flanked by an army.&lt;ref name="Tessa Bartholomeusz 2002, page 41"&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that the Buddha's teaching on nonviolence was not interpreted or put into practice in an uncompromisingly pacifist or anti-military-service way by early Buddhists.&lt;ref name="Tessa Bartholomeusz 2002, page 41"/&gt; The early texts assume war to be a fact of life, and well-skilled warriors are viewed as necessary for defensive warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In Pali texts, injunctions to abstain from violence and involvement with military affairs are directed at members of the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]; later Mahayana texts, which often generalise monastic norms to laity, require this of lay people as well.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart McFarlane in Peter Harvey, ed., ''Buddhism.'' Continuum, 2001, pages 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early texts do not contain just-war ideology as such.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that a [[suttas|sutta]] in the ''Gamani Samyuttam'' rules out all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha if it is true that, as she/he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if she/he is killed in battle while her/his mind is seized with the intention to kill, she/he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 125–126. Full texts of the sutta:[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn42/sn42.003.than.html].&lt;/ref&gt; In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.&lt;ref&gt;Rune E.A. Johansson, ''The Dynamic Psychology of Early Buddhism.'' Curzon Press 1979, page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Buddhists point to other early texts as justifying defensive war.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 40–53. Some examples are the ''Cakkavati Sihanada Sutta'', the ''Kosala Samyutta'', the ''Ratthapala Sutta'', and the ''Sinha Sutta''. See also page 125. See also Trevor Ling, ''Buddhism, Imperialism, and War.'' George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, 1979, pages 136–137.&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the ''Kosala Samyutta'', in which King [[Pasenadi]], a righteous king favored by the Buddha, learns of an impending attack on his kingdom. He arms himself in defence, and leads his army into battle to protect his kingdom from attack. He lost this battle but won the war. King Pasenadi eventually defeated King [[Ajatasattu]] and captured him alive. He thought that, although this King of [[Magadha]] has transgressed against his kingdom, he had not transgressed against him personally, and Ajatasattu was still his nephew. He released Ajatasattu and did not harm him.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2000). ''The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya''. Boston: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-331-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, the Buddha said (among other things) that Pasenadi "is a friend of virtue, acquainted with virtue, intimate with virtue", while the opposite is said of the aggressor, King Ajatasattu.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 49, 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Theravada commentaries, there are five requisite factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) the presence of a living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death.&lt;ref&gt;Hammalawa Saddhatissa, ''Buddhist Ethics.'' Wisdom Publications, 1997, pages 60, 159, see also Bartholomeusz page 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 44, 121–122, 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar]], there is circumstantial evidence encouraging Ahimsa, from the Buddha's doctrine, ''"Love all, so that you may not wish to kill any."'' Gautama Buddha distinguished between a principle and a rule. He did not make Ahimsa a matter of rule, but suggested it as a matter of principle. This gives Buddhists freedom to act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_buddha/04_02.html#03_02 The Buddha and His Dhamma]. Columbia.edu.

'''Alexander Aris Myint San Aung''' ({{lang-my|မြင့်ဆန်းအောင်}}&lt;!--The use of the HTML entity is the only way to make sure the Burmese characters display correctly--&gt;, {{IPA-my|mjɪ̰ɴ sʰáɴ àʊɴ|pron}}; born 12 April 1973) is an [[British people|English]] civil rights activist{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}. Alexander Aris is the elder son of [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] and [[Michael Aris]]. He is also a grandson of [[Aung San]], who founded the modern [[Myanmar Army|Burmese army]] and negotiated Burma's [[independence]] from the United Kingdom in 1947 and the pioneer of democracy in Myanmar.

==Early life==
Aris was born on 12 April 1973 in [[London]], United Kingdom, to Aung San Suu Kyi and Michael Aris. His younger brother Kim Aris was born in 1977. His family home was in [[Park Town, Oxford|Park Town]], [[North Oxford]]. In March 1988, his mother returned to Burma in order to nurse her dying mother [[Khin Kyi|Daw Khin Kyi]], the wife of Aung San.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Peter | last=Stanford | title=The pain of Aung Sun Suu Kyi’s sons, parted from their mother for 25 years | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/9349279/The-pain-of-Aung-Sun-Suu-Kyis-sons-parted-from-their-mother-for-25-years.html | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=22 June 2012 | accessdate=21 April 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140526123324/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/9349279/The-pain-of-Aung-Sun-Suu-Kyis-sons-parted-from-their-mother-for-25-years.html | archivedate=26 May 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She did not return to Oxford until June 2012, having been placed under house arrest in Burma for political reasons in 1989.

==Education==
Aris was educated at two private schools in his home city of [[Oxford]], in southern England: at [[The Dragon School]], a co-educational preparatory (junior) school, followed by [[Magdalen College School, Oxford|Magdalen College School]], a senior school for boys, which he left in 1990. He graduated from [[Northern Illinois University]] in the United States and received a [[MSc]] in [[Mathematical Sciences]].

==Life after mother's detention==
In 1989, Alexander and his brother Kim were both stripped of their Burmese citizenships by the ruling junta.

In 1991, Alexander's mother Aung San Suu Kyi won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for her efforts in Burma. At the time, Alexander Aris (age 18) and his brother Kim Aris (age 14) accepted the Prize on their mother's behalf.

In [[category theory]], the '''anamorphism''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἀνά|ἀνά]]}} "upwards" and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:μορφή|μορφή]]}} "form, shape") of a [[coinduction|coinductive type]] denotes the assignment of a [[coalgebra]] to its unique [[morphism]] to the [[Initial algebra|final coalgebra]] of an [[endofunctor]]. These objects are used in [[functional programming]] as ''[[Fold (higher-order function)|unfolds]]''. The [[categorical dual]] of the anamorphism is the [[catamorphism]].

== Anamorphisms in functional programming ==

In [[functional programming]], an '''anamorphism''' is a generalization of the concept of ''[[Fold (higher-order function)|unfolds]]'' on coinductive [[List (computing)|lists]]. Formally, anamorphisms are [[generic function]]s that can [[Corecursion|corecursively]] construct a result of a certain [[Algebraic data type|type]] and which is parameterized by functions that determine the next single step of the construction.

The data type in question is defined as the greatest fixed point ''ν X . F X'' of a functor ''F''. By the universal property of final coalgebras, there is a unique coalgebra morphism ''A → ν X . F X'' for any other ''F''-coalgebra ''a : A → F A''. Thus, one can define functions from a type ''A'' _into_ a coinductive datatype by specifying a coalgebra structure ''a'' on ''A''.

=== Example: Potentially infinite lists ===

As an example, the type of potentially infinite [[List (computing)|lists]] (with elements of a fixed type ''value'') is given as the fixpoint ''[value] = ν X . value × X + 1'', i.e. a list consists either of a ''value'' and a further list, or it is empty. A (pseudo-)[[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]-Definition might look like this:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data [value] = (value:[value]) | []
&lt;/source&gt;

It is the fixed point of the functor &lt;code&gt;F value&lt;/code&gt;, where:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
data F value x = Maybe (value, x)
&lt;/source&gt;

One can easily check that indeed the type &lt;code&gt;[value]&lt;/code&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;code&gt; F value [value]&lt;/code&gt;, and thus &lt;code&gt;[value]&lt;/code&gt; is the fixed point.
(Also note that in Haskell, least and greatest fixpoints of functors coincide, therefore inductive lists are the same as coinductive, potentially infinite lists.)

The ''anamorphism'' for lists (then usually known as ''unfold'') would build a (potentially infinite) list from a state value. Typically, the unfold takes a state value &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and a function &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; that yields either a pair of a value and a new state, or a singleton to mark the end of the list. The anamorphism would then begin with a first seed, compute whether the list continues or ends, and in case of a nonempty list, prepend the computed value to the recursive call to the anamorphism.

A Haskell definition of an unfold, or anamorphism for lists, called &lt;code&gt;ana&lt;/code&gt;, is as follows:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
ana :: (state -&gt; Maybe (value, state)) -&gt; state -&gt; [value]
ana f stateOld = case f stateOld of
            Nothing                -&gt; []
            Just (value, stateNew) -&gt; value : ana f stateNew
&lt;/source&gt;

We can now implement quite general functions using ''ana'', for example a countdown:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
f :: Int -&gt; Maybe (Int, Int)
f current = let oneSmaller = current - 1
            in   if oneSmaller &lt; 0
                   then Nothing
                   else Just (oneSmaller, oneSmaller)
&lt;/source&gt;
This function will decrement an integer and output it at the same time, until it is negative, at which point it will mark the end of the list. Correspondingly, &lt;code&gt;ana f 3&lt;/code&gt; will compute the list &lt;code&gt;[2,1,0]&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Anamorphisms on other data structures ===

An anamorphism can be defined for any recursive type, according to a generic pattern, generalizing the second version of ''ana'' for lists.

For example, the unfold for the tree data structure

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 data Tree a = Leaf a | Branch (Tree a) a (Tree a)
&lt;/source&gt;

is as follows
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 ana :: (b -&gt; Either a (b, a, b)) -&gt; b -&gt; Tree a
 ana unspool x = case unspool x of
                   Left a          -&gt; Leaf a
                   Right (l, x, r) -&gt; Branch (ana unspool l) x (ana unspool r)
&lt;/source&gt;

To better see the relationship between the recursive type and its anamorphism, note that &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; can be defined thus:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 newtype List a = List {unCons :: Maybe (a, List a)}

 newtype Tree a = Tree {unNode :: Either a (Tree a, a, Tree a))}
&lt;/source&gt;

The analogy with &lt;code&gt;ana&lt;/code&gt; appears by renaming &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; in its type:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 newtype List a = List {unCons :: Maybe (a, List a)}
 anaList ::       (list_a       -&gt; Maybe (a, list_a)) -&gt; (list_a -&gt; List a)

 newtype Tree a = Tree {unNode :: Either a (Tree a, a, Tree a))}
 anaTree ::       (tree_a       -&gt; Either a (tree_a, a, tree_a)) -&gt; (tree_a -&gt; Tree a)
&lt;/source&gt;

With these definitions, the argument to the constructor of the type has the same type as the return type of the first argument of &lt;code&gt;ana&lt;/code&gt;, with the recursive mentions of the type replaced with &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;.

== History ==

One of the first publications to introduce the notion of an anamorphism in the context of programming was the paper ''Functional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|citeseerx = 10.1.1.41.125
|title=Functional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire
|first=Erik
|last=Meijer
|authorlink=Erik Meijer (computer scientist)
|author2=Fokkinga, Maarten|author3=Paterson, Ross
|year=1991
}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Erik Meijer (computer scientist)|Erik Meijer]] ''et al.'', which was in the context of the [[Squiggol]] programming language.

==Applications==
Functions like [[Zip (higher-order function)|&lt;code&gt;zip&lt;/code&gt;]] and &lt;code&gt;iterate&lt;/code&gt; are examples of anamorphisms.  &lt;code&gt;zip&lt;/code&gt; takes a pair of lists, say ['a','b','c'] and [1,2,3] and returns a list of pairs [('a',1),('b',2),('c',3)]. &lt;code&gt;Iterate&lt;/code&gt; takes a thing, x, and a function, f, from such things to such things, and returns the infinite list that comes from repeated application of f, i.e. the list [x, (f x), (f (f x)), (f (f (f x))), ...].

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 zip (a:as) (b:bs) = if (as==[]) || (bs ==[])   -- || means 'or'
                      then [(a,b)]
                      else (a,b):(zip as bs) 
 
 iterate f x = x:(iterate f (f x))&lt;/source&gt;

To prove this, we can implement both using our generic unfold, &lt;code&gt;ana&lt;/code&gt;, using a simple recursive routine:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 zip2 = ana unsp fin
    where
    fin (as,bs) = (as==[]) || (bs ==[]) 
    unsp ((a:as), (b:bs)) = ((a,b),(as,bs))

 iterate2 f = ana (\a-&gt;(a,f a)) (\x-&gt;False) &lt;/source&gt;
In a language like Haskell, even the abstract functions &lt;code&gt;fold&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unfold&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ana&lt;/code&gt; are merely defined terms, as we have seen from the definitions given above.

== Anamorphisms in category theory ==

In [[category theory]], anamorphisms are the [[categorical dual]] of [[catamorphism]]s (and catamorphisms are the categorical dual of anamorphisms).

That means the following. 
Suppose (''A'', ''fin'') is a [[Initial algebra|final]] [[F-coalgebra|''F''-coalgebra]] for some [[endofunctor]] ''F'' of some [[category (mathematics)|category]] into itself.
Thus, ''fin'' is a [[morphism]] from ''A'' to ''FA'', and since it is assumed to be final we know that whenever (''X'', ''f'') is another ''F''-coalgebra (a morphism ''f'' from ''X'' to ''FX''), there will be a unique [[homomorphism]] ''h'' from (''X'', ''f'') to (''A'', ''fin''), that is a morphism ''h'' from ''X'' to ''A'' such that ''fin '''.''' h = Fh '''.''' f''.
Then for each such ''f'' we denote by '''ana''' '''''f''''' that uniquely specified morphism ''h''.

In other words, we have the following defining relationship, given some fixed ''F'', ''A'', and ''fin'' as above:

*&lt;math&gt;h = \mathrm{ana}\ f&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{fin}\circ h = Fh \circ f&lt;/math&gt;

=== Notation ===

A notation for ana ''f'' found in the literature is &lt;math&gt;[\!(f)\!]&lt;/math&gt;. The brackets used are known as '''lens brackets''', after which anamorphisms are sometimes referred to as ''lenses''.

'''Apatrapya''' (Sanskrit, also ''apatrāpya''; Pali: ''ottappa''; Tibetan Wylie: ''khrel yod pa'') is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as "decorum"  or "shame". It is defined as shunning unwholesome actions so as to not be reproached by others of good character.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 528-531.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the virtuous [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the [[Abhidharma]] teachings. 

The [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states: 

:What is apatrapya? It is to avoid what is objectionable in the eyes of others.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

The difference between [[Hri (Buddhism)|hri]] (self-respect) and ''apatrapya'' (decorum) is that ''hri'' means to refrain from unwholesome actions due to one's own conscious, while ''apatrapya'' means to refrain from unwholesome actions to avoid being reproached by others.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eric1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3676">The '''circuit topology''' of a linear [[polymer]] refers to arrangement of its intra-molecular contacts.  Examples of linear polymers with intra-molecular contacts are [[nucleic acid]]s and [[protein]]s. For defining the circuit topology, contacts are defined depending on the context. For proteins with disulfide bonds, these bonds could be considered as contacts. In a context where beta-beta interactions in proteins are more relevant, these interactions are used to define the circuit topology. As such, circuit topology framework can be applied to a wide range of applications including protein folding and analysis of genome architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212614002093 | doi=10.1016/j.str.2014.06.015 | volume=22 | title=Circuit Topology of Proteins and Nucleic Acids | year=2014 | journal=Structure | pages=1227–1237 | last1 = Mashaghi | first1 = Alireza | last2 = van Wijk | first2 = Roeland J. | last3 = Tans | first3 = Sander J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, data from [[Chromosome conformation capture|Hi-C]] and related technologies can be readily analysed using circuit topology framework. 

For a chain with two binary contacts, three arrangements are available: parallel, series and crossed. For a chain with n contacts, the topology can be described by an n by n matrix in which each element illustrates the relation between a pair of contacts and may take one of the three states, P, S and X. 
[[Image:Circuit topology.jpg|right|250px|right|Circuit topology relations in a chain with two binary contacts.]] Multi-valent intra chain interactions can often be structurally decomposed into binary interactions and then be subjected to similar analysis.

The '''classical general equilibrium model''' aims to describe the economy by aggregating the behavior of individuals and firms. Note that the classical [[general equilibrium]] model is unrelated to [[classical economics]], and was instead developed within [[neoclassical economics]] beginning in the late 19th century.

In the model, the [[individual]] is assumed to be the basic unit of analysis and these individuals, both workers and employers, will make choices that reflect their unique tastes, objectives, and preferences. It is assumed that individuals' wants typically exceed their ability to satisfy them (hence scarcity of [[good (economics)|goods]] and time). It is further assumed that individuals will eventually experience diminishing marginal utility. Finally, [[wages]] and [[prices]] are assumed to be elastic (they move up and down freely). The classical model assumes that traditional [[supply and demand]] analysis is the best approach to understanding the [[labor market]]. The functions that follow are aggregate functions that can be thought of as the summation of all the individual participants in the market.

==Aggregate supply==
{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}
==Labor demand==
The consumers of the labor market are firms. The demand for labor services is a derived demand, derived from the supply and demand for the firm's products in the goods market. It is assumed that a firm's objective is to maximize [[Profit (economics)|profit]] given the demand for its products, and given the production technology that is available to it.

Some notation:
 Let &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; be price level of commodities
 Let &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; be nominal wage
 Let &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; be real wage (w/p)
 Let &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; be profit of firms
 Let &lt;math&gt;L^{D}&lt;/math&gt; be labor demand
 Let &lt;math&gt;Y^{S}&lt;/math&gt; be the firms output of commodities that it will supply to the goods market.

===Output function===
Let us specify this output (commodity supply) function as:
:&lt;math&gt;Y^{S}(L^{D})&lt;/math&gt;
It is an increasing concave function with respect to L&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt; because of the [[Production theory basics|Diminishing Marginal Product]] of Labor. Note that in this simplified model, labour is the only factor of production. If we were analysing the goods market, this simplification could cause problems, but because we are looking at the labor market, this simplification is worthwhile.

===Firms' profit function===
Generally a firm's profit is calculated as:
 profit = revenue - cost&lt;br&gt;
In ''nominal terms'' the profit function is:
 &lt;math&gt;p \cdot \pi = p \cdot Y^{S} - w \cdot L^{D}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In ''real terms'' this becomes:
 &lt;math&gt;\pi = Y^{S} - \frac{w}{p} \cdot L^{D} = Y^{S} - \omega \cdot L^{D}&lt;/math&gt;

===Firms' optimal (profit maximizing) condition===
In an attempt to achieve an optimal situation, firms can maximize profits with this ''Maximized profit function'':
 &lt;math&gt;\frac{dY^{S}(L^{D})}{dL^{D}} = \omega&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When functions are given, Labor Demand (L&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;) can be derived from this equation.

==Labour supply==
The suppliers of the labor market are [[household]]s. A household can be thought of as the summation of all the individuals within the household. Each household offers an amount of labour services to the market. The supply of labour can be thought of as the summation of the labour services offered by all the households. The amount of service that each household offers depends on the consumption requirements of the household, and the individuals relative preference for consumption verses free time.

Some notation:
 Let U be total utility
 Let Y&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt; be commodity demand (consumption)
 Let L&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; be labor supply (hours worked)
 Let D(L&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;) be disutility from working, an increasing convex function with respect to L&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Households' consumption constraint===
Consumption constraint = profit income + wage income&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;Y^{D} = \pi + \omega \cdot L^{S}&lt;/math&gt;

===Households' utility function===
total utility = utility from consumption - disutility from work &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;U = Y^{D} - D(L^{S})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''substitute consumption''': &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;U = \pi + \omega \cdot L^{S} - D(L^{S})&lt;/math&gt;

===Households' optimal condition===
'''Maximized utility function''': &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dD(L^{S})}{dL^{S}} = \omega&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When functions are given, Labor Supply (L&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;) can be derived from this equation.

==Aggregate demand==
Y = C + I + G
whereby Y is output, C is consumption, I is investment and G is government spending

The schools of [[Mahayana Buddhism]] developed several different schemes of doctrinal classification (Chinese: jiaoxiang panshi or panjiao [tenet classification]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr|editor2-last=Lopez|editor2-first=Donald S.

==History==
The classification of Buddha teachings is discussed very early by Mahayana Buddhists in China. In 600 AD there were 10 main classifications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qts.com.cn/bezz/berr06/201101/651.html 【报恩论坛】智者大师评判“南三北七”的意义（连载一）]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huayen.org.tw/thesis/13/1315.pdf 五、六世紀中國各家的判教理論]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
And it continued to develop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BJ001/bj100610.htm Preface to The Essence of Teaching and Meditation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guoxue.com/www/xsxx/txt.asp?id=1061 1900年来佛教判教研究要述]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kukai]] in [[Japan]] wrote Himitsumandara jūjūshinron (祕密曼荼羅十住心論, Treatise on The Ten Stages of the Development of Mind) and [[Enchin]] also wrote his classification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china2551.org/Article/tmwh/tmyj/200802/3902.html 空海“十住心”的判教论] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906064458/http://www.china2551.org/Article/tmwh/tmyj/200802/3902.html |date=2013-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chibs.edu.tw/publication/chbj/10/chbj1011.htm En-nin and the Japanese Tendai School] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015081821/http://www.chibs.edu.tw/publication/chbj/10/chbj1011.htm |date=2006-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan Buddhists also developed different classifications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ifeng.com/article/1574227.html 佛教判教]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkbuddhist.org/magazine/479/479_03.html 華嚴宗佛性 思想初探 五教佛性與心性本體]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five Periods and Eight Teachings== 
[[Zhiyi]] wrote [[Mohe Zhiguan]] (摩訶止觀) and Fahua Xuanyi (法華玄義). He classifies the Buddha's teaching into 5 periods and 8 teachings (五時八教).
They are the Period of Avatamsaka (華嚴時), Agamas (阿含時), Vaipulya (方等時), Prajna (般若時) and Dharma-pundarik/Nirvana (法華涅槃時). The Eight Teachings are subdivided into two groups, one is the Fourfold Doctrines of Conversion (化法四教) and the other is the Fourfold Methods of Conversion (化儀四教). They are Tripitaka Teaching (三藏教), Shared Teaching (通教), Distinctive Teaching (別教), Complete Teaching (圓教), Sudden Teaching (頓教), Gradual Teaching (漸教), Secret Teaching (秘密教) and Variable Teaching (不定教).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131103025354/http://www.buddhistdoor.com/OldWeb/bdoor/archive/nutshell/teach70.htm Buddhism in a Nutshell - Chap 70]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Tiantai]] followed this classification.

==Five Divisions and Ten Schools==
[[Fazang]] wrote Huayan Yisheng Jiaoyi Fenqi Zhang (華嚴一乘教義分齊章).&lt;ref&gt;[http://feikongfeise.blog.163.com/blog/static/8197498520087710186372 《华严五教章》简介]&lt;/ref&gt; It classified  Buddhist teachings into 5 Divisions and 10 Schools (五教十宗). They are the teaching of sravakas (sound-hearers) (小乘教), the elementary teaching of mahayana (大乘初教), the final teaching of mahayana (大乘終教), the abrupt or sudden teaching of mahayana (大乘頓教) and the all-round or complete teaching of one vehicle (一乘圓教). The 5 divisions are further separated into 10 schools, namely the reality of self and dharma (mind and matter) (我法俱有宗), the reality of dharma, but not self (法有我無宗), dharmas have neither creation nor destruction (法無去來宗), present dharmas are both apparent and real (現通假實宗), common or phenomenal ideas are wrong, and fundamental reality is the only truth (俗妄真實宗), dharmas are merely names (諸法但有宗), all Dharmas are empty (一切皆空宗), the Bhutatathata is not unreal (真實不空宗), phenomena and their perceptions are to be eradicated (相想俱絕宗) and the perfect, all inclusive and complete teaching of one vehicle (圓明具德宗).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20110">In [[philosophy of mind|philosophy]], the '''computational theory of mind''' ('''CTM''') refers to a family of views that hold that the human [[mind]] is an [[information processing system]] and that cognition and consciousness together are a form of [[computation]]. Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943) were the first to suggest that neural activity is computational. They argued that neural computations explain [[cognition]].&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;Piccinini, Gualtierro &amp; Bahar, Sonya, 2012. "Neural Computation and the Computational Theory of Cognition" in Cognitive Science. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/cogs.12012&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was proposed in its modern form by [[Hilary Putnam]] in 1967, and developed by his PhD student, philosopher and cognitive scientist [[Jerry Fodor]] in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Hilary, 1961. "Brains and Behavior", originally read as part of the program of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Section L (History and Philosophy of Science), December 27, 1961, reprinted in Block (1983), and also along with other papers on the topic in Putnam, ''Mathematics, Matter and Method'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Computational Theory of Mind"&gt;[[Steven Horst|Horst, Steven]], (2005) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/ "The Computational Theory of Mind"] in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being vigorously disputed in [[analytic philosophy]] in the 1990s due to work by Putnam himself, [[John Searle]], and others, the view is common in modern [[cognitive psychology]] and is presumed by many theorists of [[evolutionary psychology]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} In the 2000s and 2010s the view has resurfaced in analytic philosophy (Scheutz 2003, Edelman 2008).{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The computational theory of mind holds that the mind is a computational system that is realized (i.e. physically implemented) by neural activity in the brain. The theory can be elaborated in many ways and varies largely based on how the term computation is understood. Computation is commonly understood in terms of [[Turing machine]]s which manipulate symbols according to a rule, in combination with the internal state of the machine. The critical aspect of such a computational model is that we can abstract away from particular physical details of the machine that is implementing the computation.&lt;ref name="The Computational Theory of Mind"/&gt; This is to say that computation can be implemented by silicon chips or neural networks, so long as there is a series of outputs based on manipulations of inputs and internal states, performed according to a rule. CTM, therefore holds that the mind is not simply analogous to a computer program, but that it is literally a computational system.&lt;ref name="The Computational Theory of Mind"/&gt;

Computational theories of mind are often said to require [[Representation (psychology)|mental representation]] because 'input' into a computation comes in the form of symbols or representations of other objects. A computer cannot compute an actual object, but must interpret and represent the object in some form and then compute the representation. The computational theory of mind is related to the [[representational theory of mind]] in that they both require that mental states are representations. However, the representational theory of mind shifts the focus to the symbols being manipulated. This approach better accounts for systematicity and productivity.&lt;ref name="The Computational Theory of Mind"/&gt; In Fodor's original views, the computational theory of mind is also related to the [[language of thought]]. The language of thought theory allows the mind to process more complex representations with the help of semantics. (See below in semantics of mental states).

Recent work has suggested that we make a distinction between the mind and cognition. Building from the tradition of McCulloch and Pitts, the Computational Theory of Cognition (CTC) states that neural computations explain cognition.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt; The Computational Theory of Mind asserts that not only cognition, but also phenomenal consciousness or [[qualia]], are computational. That is to say, CTM entails CTC. While phenomenal consciousness could fulfill some other functional role, computational theory of cognition leaves open the possibility that some aspects of the mind could be non-computational. CTC therefore provides an important explanatory framework for understanding neural networks, while avoiding counter-arguments that center around phenomenal consciousness.

=="Computer metaphor"==
Computational theory of mind is not the same as the computer metaphor, comparing the mind to a modern-day digital computer.&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]]. [[The Blank Slate]]. New York: Penguin. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Computational theory just uses some of the same principles as those found in digital computing.&lt;ref name="BS" /&gt; While the computer metaphor draws an analogy between the mind as software and the brain as hardware, CTM is the claim that the mind is a computational system.

'Computational system' is not meant to mean a modern-day electronic computer. Rather, a computational system is a symbol manipulator that follows step by step functions to compute input and form output. [[Alan Turing]] describes this type of computer in his concept of a [[Turing Machine]].

==Early proponents==

One of the earliest proponents of the computational theory of mind was [[Thomas Hobbes]], who said, "by reasoning, I understand computation. And to compute is to collect the sum of many things added together at the same time, or to know the remainder when one thing has been taken from another. To reason therefore is the same as to add or to subtract."&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, Thomas "De Corpore"&lt;/ref&gt; Since Hobbes lived before the contemporary identification of computing with instantiating effective procedures, he cannot be interpreted as explicitly endorsing the computational theory of mind, in the contemporary sense.

==Causal picture of thoughts==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}At the heart of the Computational Theory of Mind is the idea that thoughts are a form of computation, and a computation is by definition a systematic set of laws for the relations among representations. This means that a mental state represents something if and only if there is some causal correlation between the mental state and that particular thing. An example would be seeing dark clouds and thinking “clouds mean rain”, where there is a correlation between the thought of the clouds and rain, as the clouds causing rain.  This is sometimes known as Natural Meaning. Conversely, there is another side to the causality of thoughts and that is the non-natural representation of thoughts. An example would be seeing a red traffic light and thinking “red means stop”, there is nothing about the color red that indicates it represents stopping, and thus is just a convention that has been invented, similar to languages and their abilities to form representations.

==Semantics of mental states==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
The computational theory of mind states that the mind functions as a symbolic operator, and that mental representations are symbolic representations; just as the [[semantics]] of language are the features of words and sentences that relate to their meaning, the semantics of mental states are those meanings of representations, the definitions of the ‘words’ of the [[language of thought]]. If these basic mental states can have a particular meaning just as words in a language do, then this means that more complex mental states (thoughts) can be created, even if they have never been encountered before. Just as new sentences that are read can be understood even if they have never been encountered before, as long as the basic components are understood, and it is syntactically correct. For example: “I have eaten plum pudding every day of this fortnight.” While it's doubtful many have seen this particular configuration of words, nonetheless most readers should be able to glean an understanding of this sentence because it is syntactically correct and the constituent parts are understood.

==Criticism==

A range of arguments have been proposed against physicalist conceptions used in Computational Theories of Mind.

An early, though indirect, criticism of the Computational Theory of Mind comes from philosopher [[John Searle]].  In his thought experiment known as the [[Chinese room]], Searle attempts to refute the claims that [[artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent systems]] can be said to have [[intentionality]] and [[understanding]] and that these systems, because they can be said to be minds themselves, are sufficient for the study of the human mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Minds, brains, and programs | year = 1980 | author = Searle, J.R. | journal = The Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 417–457}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Searle asks us to imagine that there is a man in a room with no way of communicating to anyone or anything outside of the room except for a piece of paper with symbols written on it that is passed under the door.  With the paper, the man is to use a series of provided rule books to return paper containing different symbols.  Unknown to the man in the room, these symbols are of a Chinese language, and this process generates a conversation that a Chinese speaker outside of the room can actually understand. Searle contends that the man in the room does not understand the Chinese conversation.  This is essentially what the computational theory of mind presents us—a model in which the mind simply decodes symbols and outputs more symbols.  Searle argues that this is not real understanding or intentionality.  This was originally written as a repudiation of the idea that computers work like minds.

Searle has further raised questions about what exactly constitutes a computation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the wall behind my back is right now implementing the [[WordStar]] program, because there is some pattern of molecule movements that is isomorphic with the formal structure of WordStar. But if the wall is implementing WordStar, if it is a big enough wall it is implementing any program, including any program implemented in the brain.&lt;ref name=Searle1992&gt;{{Citation
 | title =  The Rediscovery of the Mind
 | year = 1992
 | author = Searle, J.R.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Objections like Searle’s might be called insufficiency objections. They claim that computational theories of mind fail because computation is insufficient to account for some capacity of the mind. Arguments from qualia, such as Frank Jackson’s [[Knowledge argument]], can be understood as objections to computational theories of mind in this way—though they take aim at physicalist conceptions of the mind in general, and not computational theories specifically.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

There are also objections which are directly tailored for computational theories of mind.

Putnam himself (see in particular ''Representation and Reality'' and the first part of ''Renewing Philosophy'') became a prominent critic of computationalism for a variety of reasons, including ones related to Searle's Chinese room arguments, questions of world-word reference relations, and thoughts about the mind-body relationship. Regarding functionalism in particular, Putnam has claimed along lines similar to, but more general than Searle's arguments, that the question of whether the human mind ''can'' implement computational states is not relevant to the question of the nature of mind, because "every ordinary open system realizes every abstract finite automaton."&lt;ref name=Putnam1988&gt;{{Citation

[[Roger Penrose]] has proposed the idea that the human mind does not use a knowably sound calculation procedure to understand and discover mathematical intricacies. This would mean that a normal [[Turing complete]] computer would not be able to ascertain certain mathematical truths that human minds can.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Penrose, "Mathematical Intelligence," in Jean Khalfa, editor, ''What is Intelligence?'', chapter 5, pages 107-136. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prominent scholars==
* [[Daniel Dennett]] proposed the [[Multiple Drafts Model]], in which consciousness seems linear but is actually blurry and gappy, distributed over space and time in the brain. Consciousness is the computation, there is no extra step or "[[Cartesian Theater]]" in which you become conscious of the computation.
* [[Jerry Fodor]] argues that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are relations between individuals and mental representations. He maintains that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Further, this language of thought itself is codified in the brain, not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought. In later work (''Concepts'' and ''The Elm and the Expert''), Fodor has refined and even questioned some of his original computationalist views, and adopted a highly modified version of LOT (see ''LOT2'').
* [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]] proposed that cognitive processes have three levels of description: the computational level (which describes that computational problem (i.e., input/output mapping) computed by the cognitive process); the algorithmic level (which presents the algorithm used for computing the problem postulated at the computational level); and the implementational level (which describes the physical implementation of the algorithm postulated at the algorithmic level in biological matter, e.g. the brain). (Marr 1981)
* [[Ulric Neisser]] coined the term 'cognitive psychology' in his book published in 1967 (''Cognitive Psychology''), wherein Neisser characterizes people as dynamic information-processing systems whose mental operations might be described in computational terms.
* [[Steven Pinker]] described a "language instinct," an evolved, built-in capacity to learn language (if not writing).
* [[Hilary Putnam]] proposed [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] to describe consciousness, asserting that it is the computation that equates to consciousness, regardless of whether the computation is operating in a brain, in a computer, or in a "brain in a vat."
* [[Georges Rey]], professor at the [[University of Maryland]], builds on Jerry Fodor's representational theory of mind to produce his own version of a Computational/Representational Theory of Thought.

[[File:Chief Justice John Marshall.jpeg|thumb|Chief Justice John Marshall]]
The '''Discovery doctrine''' is a concept of [[public international law]] expounded by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in a series of decisions, most notably ''[[Johnson v. M'Intosh]]'' in 1823.  Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] explained and applied the way that [[colonialism|colonial powers]] laid claim to lands belonging to foreign sovereign nations during the [[Age of Discovery]].  Under it, [[title (property)|title]] to lands lay with the government whose subjects travelled to and occupied a territory whose inhabitants were not subjects of a European Christian monarch. The doctrine has been primarily used to support decisions invalidating or ignoring [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] possession of land in favor of colonial or post-colonial governments.

The 1823 case was the result of [[collusive lawsuit]]s where land speculators worked together to make claims to achieve a desired result.&lt;ref&gt;''How the Indians Lost Their Land: Law and Power on the Frontier'' Stuart Banner, 2005, pg 171-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Dark Side of Efficiency: Johnson v. M'Intosh and the Expropriation of American Indian Lands'', Eric Kades, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1065 2000, pg 148&lt;/ref&gt; John Marshall explained the Court's reasoning. The decision has been the subject of a number of law review articles and has come under increased scrutiny by modern legal theorists.

== History ==
The Doctrine of Discovery was promulgated by European monarchies in order to legitimize the colonization of lands outside of Europe. Between the mid-fifteenth century and the mid-twentieth century, this idea allowed European entities to seize lands inhabited by indigenous peoples under the guise of discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nation to Nation: Treaties Between the United States &amp; American Indians|last=Harjo|first=Susan Shown|publisher=[[National Museum of the American Indian]]|year=2014|isbn=9781588344786|location=Washington, DC|pages=15-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1494, the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] declared that only non-Christian lands could be colonized under the Discovery Doctrine.

In 1792, U.S. Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]] declared that the Doctrine of the Discovery would extend from Europe to the infant U.S. government. The Doctrine and its legacy continue to influence [[American imperialism]] and treatment of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States|last = Dunbar-Ortiz|first = Roxanne|publisher = Beacon Press|year = 2014|isbn =|location = Boston|pages = 197–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Johnson v. M'Intosh''==
{{main article|Johnson v. M'Intosh}}
The plaintiff Johnson had inherited land, originally purchased from the Piankeshaw tribes. Defendant McIntosh claimed the same land, having purchased it under a grant from the United States. It appears that in 1775 members of the Piankeshaw tribe sold certain land in the Indiana Territory to Lord Dunmore, royal governor of Virginia and others. In 1805 the Piankeshaw conveyed much of the same land to [[William Henry Harrison]], governor of the Indiana Territory, thus giving rise to conflicting claims of title.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;[http://law.shu.edu/Students/academics/journals/law-review/Issues/archives/upload/watson.pdf Watson, Blake A., "John Marshall and Indian Land Rights: A Historical Rejoinder to the Claim of “Universal Recognition” of the Doctrine of Discovery", ''Seton Hall Law Review'', Vol.36, 481]&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing whether the courts of the United States should recognize land titles obtained from Native Americans prior to American independence, the court decided that they should not. Chief Justice John Marshall had large real estate holdings that would have been affected if the case were decided in favor of Johnson.  Rather than remove himself from the case, however, the chief justice wrote the decision for a unanimous US Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Report on Impact on Indigenous Peoples of the International Legal construct known as the Doctrine of Discovery |[https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/E%20C.19%202010%2013.DOC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312093507/https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/E%20C.19%202010%2013.DOC |date=March 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
Marshall found that ownership of land comes into existence by virtue of discovery of that land, a rule that had been observed by all European countries with settlements in the New World. Legally, the United States was the true owner of the land because it inherited that ownership from Britain, the original discoverer.

Marshall noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;On the discovery of this immense continent, the great nations of Europe ... as they were all in pursuit of nearly the same object, it was necessary, in order to avoid conflicting settlements, and consequent war with each other, to establish a principle which all should acknowledge as the law by which the right of acquisition, which they all asserted, should be regulated as between themselves. This principle was that discovery gave title to the government by whose subjects, or by whose authority, it was made, against all other European governments, which title might be consummated by possession. ... The history of America, from its discovery to the present day, proves, we think, the universal recognition of these principles.&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;[http://www.historytools.org/sources/Johnson-v-MIntosh.pdf Marshall, John. "Johnson v. M'Intosh", 21 U.S. 543, 5 L.Ed. 681, 8 Wheat. 543 (1823)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
{{PropertyLaw}}
Chief Justice Marshall noted the 1455 papal bull [[Romanus Pontifex]] approved [[Portugal]]'s claims to lands discovered along the coast of [[West Africa]], and the 1493 [[Inter Caetera]] had ratified [[Spain]]'s right to conquer newly found lands, after [[Christopher Columbus]] had already begun doing so,&lt;ref name=Newcomb&gt;{{cite journal | last = Newcomb | first = Steve |date=Fall 1992 | title = Five Hundred Years of Injustice | journal = Shaman's Drum | pages = 18–20 | url = http://ili.nativeweb.org/sdrm_art.html | accessdate = 2007-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but stated:
"Spain did not rest her title solely on the grant of the Pope. Her discussions respecting boundary, with France, with Great Britain, and with the United States, all show that she placed it on the rights given by discovery. Portugal sustained her claim to the {{not a typo|Brazils}} by the same title."&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

==United States law==
Marshall pointed to the exploration charters given to [[John Cabot]] as proof that the British had operated under the doctrine.&lt;ref name=Newcomb/&gt;  The tribes which occupied the land were, at the moment of discovery, no longer completely [[sovereignty|sovereign]] and had no [[property]] rights but rather merely held a right of [[occupancy]].  Further, only the discovering nation or its successor could take possession of the land from the natives by conquest or purchase.

The doctrine was cited in other cases as well.  With ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]'', it supported the concept that tribes were not independent states but "domestic dependent nations".&lt;ref name=Newcomb/&gt;  The decisions in ''[[Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe]]'' and ''[[Duro v. Reina]]'' used the doctrine to prohibit tribes from criminally prosecuting first non-Indians, then Indians who were not a member of the prosecuting tribe.&lt;ref name=Robertson&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thorpe.ou.edu/guide/robertson.html | title = Native Americans and the Law: Native Americans Under Current United States Law | accessdate = 2007-01-10 | last = Robertson | first = Lindsay G. |date=June 2001 | work = Native American Constitution and Law Digitization Project | publisher = The University of Oklahoma Law Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine has been cited by the US Supreme Court as recently as 2005, in City of Sherrill, NY v. Oneida Nation: "Under the 'doctrine of discovery...' fee title (ownership) to the lands occupied by Indians when the colonists arrived became vested in the sovereign-first the discovering European nation and later the original states and the United States."

== History ==
The Doctrine of Discovery was promulgated by European monarchies in order to legitimize the colonization of lands outside of Europe. Between the mid-fifteenth century and the mid-twentieth century, this idea allowed European entities to seize lands inhabited by indigenous peoples under the guise of discovery. In 1494, the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] declared that only non-Christian lands could be colonized under the Discovery Doctrine.

In 1792, U.S. Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]] declared that the Doctrine of the Discovery would extend from Europe to the infant U.S. government. The Doctrine and its legacy continue to influence [[American imperialism]] and treatment of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Legal critique ==
As the Piankeshaw were not party to the litigation, "no Indian voices were heard in a case which had, and continues to have, profound effects on Indian property rights."&lt;ref&gt;Dussias, Allison M., "Squaw Drudges, Farm Wives, and the Dann Sisters' Last Stand: American Indian Women’s Resistance to Domestication and the Denial of Their Property Rights", 77 N.C. L. REV. 637, 645 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Blake A. Watson of the University of Dayton School of Law finds Marshall's claim of "universal recognition" of the "doctrine of discovery" historically inaccurate.

In reviewing the history of European exploration Marshall did not take note of Spanish Dominican philosopher [[Francisco de Vitoria]]'s 1532 ''De Indis'' nor ''De Jure belli Hispanorum in barbaros''. Vitoria adopted from [[Thomas Aquinas]] the Roman law concept of ''ius gentium'', and concluded that the Indians were rightful owners of their property and that their chiefs validly exercised jurisdiction over their tribes, a position held previously by Palacios Rubios. His defense of American Indians was based on a scholastic understanding of the intrinsic dignity of man, a dignity he found being violated by Spain's policies in the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Pagden, Anthony. ''Vitoria: Political Writings'', Cambridge University Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall also overlooked more recent American experience, specifically [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]'s purchase of the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Providence Plantation]]. In order to forestall Massachusetts and Plymouth designs on the land, Williams subsequently traveled to England to obtain a patent which referenced the purchase from the natives. The Royal Charter of Rhode Island issued by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] acknowledged the rights of the Indians to the land.&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt;

Nor does Justice Marshall seem to have taken note of the policy of the Dutch West India Company which only conferred ownership rights in [[New Netherland]] after the grantee had acquired title by purchase from the Indian owners, a practice also followed by the Quakers in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt;

Watson and others, such as Robert Williams Jr. suggest that Marshall misinterpreted the "discovery doctrine" as giving exclusive right to lands discovered, rather than the exclusive right to treaty with the inhabitants thereof.&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt;

== Contemporary advocacy efforts ==
Discovery doctrine has been severely condemned as socially unjust, racist, and in violation of basic and fundamental human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://undesadspd.org/IndigenousPeoples/NewsandMedia/tabid/1615/news/259/Default.aspx Concluding session, Permanent Forum says impact of racist ‘Doctrine of Discovery’]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]] noted Discovery doctrine "as the foundation of the violation of their (Indigenous people) human rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/E.C.19.2010.13%20EN.pdf|title=Preliminary study of the impact on indigenous peoples of the international legal construct known as the Doctrine of Discovery|publisher=[[United Nations Economic and Social Council]]|accessdate=4 January 2014|date=4 Feb 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]]  Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues called for a mechanism to investigate historical land claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2012/hr5088.doc.htm|title=Doctrine of Discovery|work=HR/5088|publisher=[[United Nations Economic and Social Council]]|accessdate=21 November 2013|date=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] conducted on 8–17 August 2009, the bishops of the church adopted a resolution officially repudiating the discovery doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Schjonberg, Mary Frances.  [http://library.episcopalchurch.org/article/general-convention-renounces-doctrine-discovery "General Convention renounces Doctrine of Discovery"], ''Episcopal Life Online,'' 27 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2012 [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] General Assembly in Phoenix, AZ, delegates of the Unitarian Universalist Association passed a resolution repudiating the Doctrine of Discovery and calling on Unitarian Universalists to study the Doctrine and eliminate its presence from the current-day policies, programs, theologies, and structures of Unitarian Universalism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uua.org/multiculturalism/dod&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, at its 29th [[General Synods of the United Church of Christ|General Synod]], the [[United Church of Christ]] followed suit in repudiating the doctrine in a near-unanimous vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.org/news/GS2013-Doctrine-of-discovery-repudiated.html  General Synod delegates overwhelmingly approve resolution repudiating the Doctrine of Discovery]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2016 Synod, 10-17 June in Grand Rapids, MI, delegates to the annual  general assembly of the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America|Christian Reformed Church]] rejected the Doctrine of Discovery as heresy in response to a study report on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebanner.org/news/2016/06/synod-2016-rejects-doctrine-of-discovery-as-heresy|title=Synod 2016 Rejects Doctrine of Discovery as Heresy|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2016, on November 3, a group of 500 clergy members publicly denounced the Doctrine of Discovery at the Standing Rock pipeline protests.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

[[File:Egocentrism1.Musfica.png|thumb|Egocentrism]]
'''Egocentrism''' is the inability to differentiate between self and other. More specifically, it is the inability to untangle subjective [[Schema (psychology)|schema]]s from objective reality and an inability to understand or assume any perspective other than one's own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderman|first1=Eric M.|last2=Anderman|first2=Lynley H.|title=Egocentrism|journal=Psychology of Classroom Learning: An Encyclopedia|date=2009|volume=1|pages=355–357|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3027800102&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=728b0bdaba5697edd4c746b81143d889}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4jzwt9fUo1kC&amp;pg=PA134 134]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although egocentrism and [[narcissism]] appear similar, they are not the same. A person who is egocentric believes they are the center of attention, like a narcissist, but does not receive gratification by one's own admiration. Both [[Egotism|egotists]] and narcissists are people whose egos are greatly influenced by the approval of others, while for egocentrists this may or may not be true.

Although egocentric behaviors are less prominent in adulthood, the existence of some forms of egocentrism in adulthood indicates that overcoming egocentrism may be a lifelong development that never achieves completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pronin|first1=Emily|last2=Olivola|first2=Christopher Y.|title=Encyclopedia of Human Development|date=2006|publisher=SAGE Reference|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=441–442|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3466300229&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=511ed2d691ff0fe2e05fddeb93158426|accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults appear to be less egocentric than children because they are faster to correct from an initially egocentric perspective than children, not because they are less likely to initially adopt an egocentric perspective.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Perspective taking in children and adults: Equivalent egocentrism but differential correction|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103104000241|journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date = 2004-11-01|pages = 760–768|volume = 40|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2004.02.002|first = Nicholas|last = Epley|first2 = Carey K|last2 = Morewedge|first3 = Boaz|last3 = Keysar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, egocentrism is found across the life span: in infancy,&lt;ref name="Onishi, K. H. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Onishi, K. H., Baillargeon, R.|year=2005|title=Do 15-month-old infants understand false beliefs?|journal=Science|volume=308|issue=5719|pages=255–258|pmid=15821091|pmc=3357322|doi=10.1126/science.1107621}}&lt;/ref&gt; early childhood,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wimmer&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Wimmer, H., Perner, J. |year=1983|title=Beliefs about beliefs: Representation and constraining function of wrong beliefs in young children's understanding of deception|journal=Cognition|volume=13|issue=1|pages=103–128|pmid=6681741|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/chwe/austen/wimmerperner.pdf|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(83)90004-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; adolescence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Adams, G.

==During infancy==
The main concept infants and young children learn by beginning to show egocentrism is the fact that their thoughts, values, and behaviors are different from those of others, also known as the theory of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Premack, D., Woodruff, G.|year=1978|title=Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=1|issue=4|pages=515–526|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00076512}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially when children begin to have social interactions with others, mainly the caregivers, they misinterpret that they are one entity, because they are together for a long duration of time and the caregivers often provide for the children's needs.  For example, a child may misattribute the act of their mother reaching to retrieve an object that they point to as a sign that they are the same entity, when in fact they are actually separate individuals.  As early as 15 months old,&lt;ref name="Onishi, K. H. 2005"/&gt; children show a mix of egocentrism and [[theory of mind]] when an agent acts inconsistently with how the children expect him to behave.  In this study the children observed the experimenter place a toy inside one of two boxes, but did not see  when the experimenter removed the toy from the original box and placed it in the other box, due to obstruction by a screen. When the screen was removed the children watched the experimenter reach to take the toy out of one of the boxes, yet because the children did not see the switching part, they looked at the experimenter's action much longer when she reached for the box opposite to the one she originally put the toy in.  Not only does this show the existence of infants' memory capacity, but it also demonstrates how they have expectations based on their knowledge, as they are surprised when those expectations are not met.

==During childhood==
According to [[George Butterworth (psychologist)|George Butterworth]] and Margaret Harris, during [[childhood]], one is usually unable to distinguish between what is [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Butterworth G Harris M |title=Principles of developmental psychology |year=1994 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. |location=Hillsdale, NJ England}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], "an egocentric child assumes that other people see, hear, and feel exactly the same as the child does."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/preoperational.html|title=Preoperational Stage|year=2010|author=McLeod, Saul}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=January 2015}}

[[Jean Piaget]] (1896–1980) developed a theory about the development of human intelligence, describing the [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|stages of cognitive development]]. He claimed that early childhood is the time of pre-operational thought, characterized by children's inability to process logical thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Pronin, E., &amp; Olivola, C. Y.|year=2006 | url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3466300229&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=511ed2d691ff0fe2e05fddeb93158426 | title =  Egocentrism|editor=N. J. Salkind|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Human Development|volume=1|pages=441–442|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|publisher=SAGE Reference|accessdate=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Piaget, one of the main obstacles to logic that children possess includes centration, "the tendency to focus on one aspect of a situation to the exclusion of others."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invitation to the Life Span, Second Edition|last = Berger|first = Kathleen Stassen|publisher = Worth Publishers|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular type of centration is egocentrism – literally, "self-centeredness." Piaget claimed that young children are egocentric, capable of contemplating the world only from their personal perspective. For example, a three-year-old presented his mother a model truck as her birthday present; "he had carefully wrapped the present and gave it to his mother with an expression that clearly showed he expected her to love it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theories of Development: Concepts and Applications, Fifth Edition|last = Crain|first = William C.|publisher = Prentice Hall|year = 2005|isbn = |location = Upper Saddle River, NJ|pages = 108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-year-old boy had not chosen the present out of [[selfishness]] or greediness, but he simply failed to realize that, from his mother's perspective, she might not enjoy the model car as much as he would.

Piaget was concerned with two aspects of egocentricity in children: [[language]] and [[morality]].&lt;ref name="Fogiel"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fogiel |first=M |title=The psychology problem solver: a complete solution guide to any textbook |year=1980 |publisher=Research &amp; Education Association |location=New Jersey, NJ US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that egocentric children use language primarily for communication with oneself. Piaget observed that children would talk to themselves during play, and this egocentric speech was merely the child's thoughts.&lt;ref name="Junefelt"&gt;{{cite book |last=Junefelt |first=K |title=Rethinking egocentric speech: towards a new hypothesis |year=2007 |publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]] |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that this speech had no special function; it was used as a way of accompanying and reinforcing the child's current activity. He theorized that as the child matures cognitively and socially the amount of egocentric speech used would be reduced.&lt;ref name="Junefelt" /&gt; However, [[Vygotsky]] felt that egocentric speech has more meaning, as it allows the child's growth in social speech and high mental development.&lt;ref name="Junefelt" /&gt; In addition to Piaget's theory, he believed that when communicating with others, the child believes that others know everything about the topic of discussion and become frustrated when asked to give further detail.&lt;ref name="Fogiel" /&gt;

Piaget also believed that egocentrism affects the child's sense of morality.&lt;ref name="Fogiel" /&gt; Due to egocentrism, the child is only concerned with the final outcome of an event rather than another's intentions. For example, if someone breaks the child's toy, the child would not forgive the other and the child would not be able to understand that the person who broke the toy did not intend to break it.&lt;ref name="Fogiel" /&gt; This phenomenon can also be backed by the evidence from the findings of the case study by Nelson, who studied the use of motives and outcomes by young children as aiding to form their moral judgements.

Piaget did a test to investigate egocentrism called the mountains study. He put children in front of a simple plaster mountain range and then asked them to pick from four pictures the view that he, Piaget, would see. The younger children before age seven picked the picture of the view they themselves saw and were therefore found to lack the ability to appreciate a viewpoint different from their own. In other words, their way of reasoning was egocentric. Only when entering the concrete-operational stage of development at age seven to twelve, children became less egocentric and could appreciate viewpoints other than their own. In other words, they were capable of cognitive perspective-taking. However, the mountains test has been criticized for judging only the child's visuo-spatial awareness, rather than egocentrism. A follow up study involving police dolls showed that even young children were able to correctly say what the interviewer would see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychlotron.org.uk/newResources/cogdev/A2_AQB_cogDev_egocentrismTests.pdf |title=Tests of egocentrism  |last=Sammons |first=A |year=2010 |publisher=Psychlotron.org.uk |accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that Piaget overestimated the extent of egocentrism in children. Egocentrism is thus the child's inability to see other people's viewpoints, not to be confused with selfishness. The child at this stage of [[cognitive development]] assumes that their view of the world is the same as other peoples.

In addition, a more well-known experiment by Wimmer and Perner (1983) called the false-belief task demonstrates how children show their acquisition of theory of mind (ToM) as early as 4 years old.&lt;ref name=Wimmer/&gt; In this task, children see a scenario where one character hides a marble in a basket, walks out of the scene, and another character that is present takes out the marble and put it in a box.  Knowing that the first character did not see the switching task, children were asked to predict where the first character would look to find the marble.  The results show that children younger than 4 answer that the character would look inside the box, because they have the superior knowledge of where the marble actually is.  It shows egocentric thinking in early childhood because they thought that even if the character itself did not see the entire scenario, it has the same amount of knowledge as oneself and therefore should look inside the box to find the marble.  As children start to acquire ToM, their ability to recognize and process others' beliefs and values overrides the natural tendency to be egocentric.

==During adolescence==
{{See|Adolescent egocentrism}}

Although most of the research completed on the study of egocentrism is primarily focused on early childhood development, it has been found to also occur during adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Goossens L. |author2=Seiffge-Krenke I. |author3=Marcoen A. | year = 1992 | title = The many faces of adolescent egocentrism: Two European replications | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescent Research | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 43–58 | doi = 10.1177/074355489271004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Elkind]] was one of the first to discover the presence of egocentrism in adolescence and late adolescence. He argues, "the young adolescent, because of the physiological metamorphosis he is undergoing, is primarily concerned with himself. Accordingly, since he fails to differentiate between what others are thinking about and his own mental preoccupations, he assumes that other people are obsessed with his behavior and appearance as he is himself."&lt;ref name="Elkind"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1127100 |author=Elkind D |title=Egocentrism in adolescence |jstor=1127100 |journal=Child Dev |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=1025–34 |date=December 1967 |pmid=5583052 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that the adolescent is exhibiting egocentrism, by struggling to distinguish whether or not, in actuality, others are as fond of them as they might think because their own thoughts are so prevalent. Adolescents consider themselves as "unique, special, and much more socially significant than they actually are."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Elkind also created terms to help describe the egocentric behaviors exhibited by the adolescent population such as what he calls an [[imaginary audience]], the [[personal fable]], and the invincibility fable. Usually when an egocentric adolescent is experiencing an imaginary audience, it entails the belief that there is an audience captivated and constantly present to an extent of being overly interested about the egocentric individual. Personal fable refers to the idea that many teenagers believe their thoughts, feelings, and experiences are unique and more extreme than anyone else's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vartanian LR |title=Revisiting the imaginary audience and personal fable constructs of adolescent egocentrism: a conceptual review |journal=Adolescence |volume=35 |issue=140 |pages=639–61 |date=Winter 2000 |pmid=11214204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the invincibility fable, the adolescent believes in the idea that he or she is immune to misfortune and cannot be harmed by things that might defeat a normal person.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Egocentrism in adolescence is often viewed as a negative aspect of their thinking ability because adolescents become consumed with themselves and are unable to effectively function in society due to their skewed version of reality and cynicism.

There are various reasons as to why adolescents experience egocentrism:
* Adolescents are often faced with new social environments (for example, starting secondary school) which require the adolescent to protect the self which may lead to egocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Peterson K. L. |author2=Roscoe B. | year = 1991 | title = Imaginary audience behavior in older adolescent females | url = | journal = Adolescence | volume = 26 | issue = 101| pages = 195–200 | pmid=2048473 | doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Development of the adolescent's identity may lead to the individual experiencing high levels of uniqueness which subsequently becomes egocentric – this manifests as the personal fable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Connor B. P. |author2=Nikolic J. | year = 1990 | title = Identity development and formal operations as sources of adolescent egocentrism | url = | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 149–158 | doi = 10.1007/BF01538718 | pmid=24272375}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parental rejection may lead to the adolescents experiencing high levels of self-consciousness, which can lead to egocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Riley T. |author2=Adams G. R. |author3=Nielsen E. | year = 1984 | title = Adolescent egocentrism: The association among imaginary audience behavior, cognitive development, and parental support and rejection | url = | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 13 | issue = 5| pages = 401–417 | doi = 10.1007/BF02088638 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study was completed on 163 undergraduate students to examine the adolescent egocentrism in college students.  Students were asked to complete a self-report questionnaire to determine the level of egocentrism present. The questions simply asked for the reactions that students had to seemingly embarrassing situations. It was found that adolescent egocentrism was more prevalent in the female population than the male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rycek RF, Stuhr SL, McDermott J, Benker J, Swartz MD |title=Adolescent egocentrism and cognitive functioning during late adolescence |journal=Adolescence |volume=33 |issue=132 |pages=745–9 |date=Winter 1998 |pmid=9886002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This again exemplifies the idea that egocentrism is present in even late adolescence.

Results from other studies have come to the conclusion that egocentrism does not present itself in some of the same patterns as it was found originally. More recent studies have found that egocentrism is prevalent in later years of development unlike Piaget's original findings that suggested that egocentrism is only present in early childhood development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Myers, David G. |title=Psychology |publisher=Worth |location=New York |year=2008 |isbn=1-4292-2863-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Egocentrism is especially dominant in early adolescence, particularly when adolescents encounter new environments, such as a new school or a new peer group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition, throughout adolescence egocentrism contributes to the development of self-identity; in order to achieve self-identity, adolescents go through different pathways of "crisis" and "commitment" stages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcia, J. E.|year=1980|contribution=Identity in adolescence|editor=Adelson, J.|title=Handbook of Adolescent Psychology|publisher=Wiley|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and higher self-identity achievement was found to be correlated with heightened egocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=O'Connor, B. P.|author2=Nikolic, J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1990|title=Identity development and formal operations as sources of adolescent egocentrism|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|volume=19|issue=2|pages=149–158|pmid=24272375|doi=10.1007/BF01538718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==During adulthood==
The prevalence of egocentrism in the individual has been found to decrease between the ages of 15 and 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Louw |first=DA |title=Human development, 2nd Ed. |year=1998 |publisher=Kagiso Tertiary |location=Cape Town, South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, adults are also susceptible to be egocentric or to have reactions or behaviours that can be categorized as egocentric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tesch S. |author2=Whitbourne S. K. |author3=Nehrke M. F. | year = 1978 | title = Cognitive egocentrism in institutionalized adult | url = | journal = Journal of Gerontology | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 546–552 | doi=10.1093/geronj/33.4.546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frankenberger tested adolescents (14–18 years old) and adults (20–89) on their levels of egocentrism and self-consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Frankenberger K. D. | year = 2000 | title = Adolescent egocentrism: A comparison among adolescents and adults | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescence | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 343–354 | doi = 10.1006/jado.2000.0319 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that egocentric tendencies had extended to early adulthood and these tendencies were also present in the middle adult years.

Baron and Hanna looked at 152 participants and tested to see how the presence of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] affected egocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baron |first1=P |last2=Hanna |first2=J |year=1990 |title=Egocentrism and depressive symptomatology in young adults |journal=Social Behavior and Personality |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=279–285 |doi=10.2224/sbp.1990.18.2.279}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tested adults between the ages of 18 and 25 and found that the participants who suffered from depression showed higher levels of egocentrism than those who did not.

Finally, Surtees and Apperly found that when adults were asked to judge the number of dots they see and the number of dots the avatar in the computer simulation sees, the presence of the avatar interfered with the participants' judgment-making during the trials. Specifically, these were the trials where the number of dots seen by the participant was inconsistent from the number of dots the avatar saw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Surtees, A. D. R.|author2=Apperly, I. A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2012|title=Egocentrism and automatic perspective taking in children and adults|journal=Child Development|volume=83|issue=2|pages=452–460|pmid=22335247|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01730.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such effect on the participants diminished when the avatar was replaced with a simple yellow or blue line, which concluded that somehow the avatar having a personal attribute implicitly caused the participants to include its "vision" into their own decision making.  That said, they made more errors when they saw prompts such as "the avatar sees N" when N was the number of dots the participant saw and not the avatar, which shows that egocentric thought is still predominant in making quick judgments, even if the adults are well aware that their thoughts could differ from others.

The '''European dark bee''' ('''''Apis mellifera mellifera''''') is a subspecies of the [[western honey bee]], whose original range stretched from west-central Russia through Northern Europe and probably down to the Iberian Peninsula. They belong to the 'M' lineage of ''Apis mellifera''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apidologie.org/articles/apido/pdf/2007/02/m6083.pdf Gene flow within the M evolutionary lineage of Apis mellifera: role of the Pyrenees, isolation by distance and post-glacial re-colonization routes in western Europe]. Apidologie 38 (2007) 141–155. 2 August 2006. p141&lt;/ref&gt;. They are large for honey bees though they have unusually short tongues (5.7-6.4mm) and traditionally were called the German Dark Bee, a name still used today&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Characteristics of Races of Honeybees |url=http://three-peaks.net/PDF/Races%20of%20Honey%20Bees%2001.pdf |website=three-peaks.net |publisher=Three Peaks |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ironically they are now considered an Endangered Breed in Germany&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rote Liste der bedrohten Nutztierrassen in Deutschland |url=http://www.g-e-h.de/die-geh1/rote-liste |website=g-e-h.de |publisher=Gesellschaft zur Erhaltung alter und gefährdeter Haustierrassen e. V. (GEH) |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Their common name is derived from their brown-black color, with only a few lighter yellow spots on the abdomen&lt;ref name="Winston1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark L. Winston|title=The Biology of the Honey Bee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5iobWHLtAQC&amp;pg=PA10|year=1991|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-07409-5|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However today they are more likely to be called after the geographic / political region in which they live such as the British Black Bee, the Native Irish Honey Bee, the Cornish Black Bee and the Nordic Brown Bee, even though they are all the same subspecie, with the word ''native'' often being added by local beekeepers, even if the bee was introduced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Colonsay Dark Native Bees (Photo at bottom)) |title=Colonsay Black Bee Reserve |url=http://www.snhbs.scot/colonsay/ |website=snhbs.scot |publisher=SNHBS |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was domesticated in Europe and hives were brought to [[North America]] in the colonial era, where they were referred to as the English Fly by the native american indians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Renaud |first1=Tabitha |title=Finding worth in the wilderness |date=2010 |publisher=University of Ottawa |location=Ottawa, Canada |isbn=9780494741429 |pages=74 |edition=Thesis |url=http://cuisinedocbox.com/Cuisine_Specific/71229567-U-ottawa-l-universtte-canadieruie-canada-s-university.html |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The A. m. mellifera can be distinguished from other subspecies by their stocky body, abundant thoracal and sparse abdominal hair which is brown, and overall dark coloration. Overall, when viewed from a distance, they should appear blackish, or in ''mellifera'', rich dark brown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Institute for Bee Research (European Apis mellifera) |url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/beebreed/ZWS/ |website=beebreed.eu |publisher=Institute for Bee Research, Hohen Neuendorf, Germany. |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Character==
The ''A. m. mellifera'' is descended from the M lineage of ''[[Apis mellifera]]'', of which all bees to a greater or lesser degree have a strongly defensive instinct (from the point of view of the bee) or strong aggression (from the point of view of the beekeeper), especially when compared to the C lineage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yates |first1=J.D. |last2=Yates |first2=B.D. |title=Beekeeping Study Notes for the BBKA Examinations Vol.1 |date=1996 |publisher=Northern Bee Books |isbn=978-0905652818 |pages=28-29 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
''A. m. mellifera'' hybrids have an even greater reputation of aggression amongst beekeepers, which can increase in subsequent generations, if left unchecked&lt;ref name="gdeb.eu"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bruder |first1=Adam |title=Die wirtschaftliche Bedeutung der Kombinationszucht (seitennummer 7-8) |url=https://wp.gdeb.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Vortrag-Koeln.pdf |website=Gemeinschaft der europäischen Buckfastimker e.V. |accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although this characteristic can be overcome with continual selective breeding over some generations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Waring |first1=Claire |last2=Waring |first2=Adrian |title=The Bee Manual |date=2014 |publisher=J H Haynes &amp; Co Ltd |isbn=0857338099 |pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They are nervous and aggressive to the extent that routine inspections will take longer, decreasing the enjoyment of managing their colonies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=Celia F. |title=The Honey Bee around &amp; about |date=2014 |publisher=Bee Craft Ltd. |isbn=978-0-900147-15-9 |pages=10 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This characteristic is one that has been traditionally associated with ''A. m. mellifera'' going back to the old British Black bee before the early 1900's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Winston |first1=Mark L. |title=The Biology of the Honey Bee |date=1991 |publisher=First Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-07409-2 |pages=10 |edition=paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yates |first1=J.D. |last2=Yates |first2=B.D. |title=Beekeeping Study Notes for the BBKA Examinations Vol.1 |date=1996 |publisher=Northern Bee Books |isbn=978-0905652818 |pages=29 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;: To quote [[Brother Adam]] who had first hand experience, "The native (British Black) bee had undoubtedly many extremely valuable characteristics, but equally so a great many serious defects and drawbacks. She was very bad tempered and very susceptible to brood diseases and would in any case not have been able to produce the crops (of honey) we have secured since her demise"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brother Adam O.B.E. |title=Beekeeping at Buckfast Abbey |date=1975 |publisher=British Bee Publications |pages=12 |edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Significance==
''Apis mellifera mellifera'' is no longer a significant commercial subspecies of the [[Western honey bee]], but there are a number of dedicated hobbyist beekeepers that keep these bees in northern and central Europe. Immigrants brought these subspecies into the Americas. Prior to their arrival, the American continent did not have any honey bees{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}.
[[File:British Black Bee, Lost Gardens of Heligan Sep 2017 1920 x 1080.png|thumb|Apis mellifera mellifera]]

In north western Europe, ''A. m. mellifera'' were the original honey bee stock until creation of the ''[[Buckfast bee]]'' a breed of bee whose progeny originally included the remnants of the old British black bee (''A. m. mellifera''), which became extinct due to the ''[[Acarapis woodi]]'' (acarine mite).

In the United States, research based on DNA sequencing analysis found DNA from the 'M' lineage of honey bees in the feral population of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Missouri, believed in part to be the DNA from imported bees of over 100 years ago (DNA from the other bee lineages was also found in these feral populations, suggesting that they likely came from escaped swarms from apiaries at unknown times in the past)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Honey Bee &amp; Bumble Bee Genetics Research |url=http://comp.uark.edu/~aszalan/Site/Apis/Honey_Bee_Research.html |website=Insects Genetics Lab |publisher=University of Arkansas |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527202036/http://comp.uark.edu/~aszalan/Site/Apis/Honey_Bee_Research.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the documentary [[More than Honey]] the bee kept and bred by Swiss (German) beekeeper Herr. Fred Jaggi was the ''A. m. mellifera'', referred to as the "local black breed", in which he strives to maintain "racially pure" bees, lamenting when he discovers yellow coloration in the colony of one of his queens, meaning that she has bred with a drone from a different subspecie and produced "little half-breeds", she is subsequently killed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=More than Honey |url=http://www.morethanhoneyfilm.com/protagonists.html |website=morethanhoneyfilm.com |publisher=Marcus Imhoof |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;; we see in the documentary his pure bees succumbing to a brood disease and having to be gassed then burned: Herr.

'''"Every Race Has a Flag but the Coon"''' was a  [[song]] written by [[Will A. Heelan]], and [[J. Fred Helf]] that was popular in the United States and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The song followed the previous success of "[[All Coons Look Alike to Me]]", written in 1896 by [[Ernest Hogan]]. [[H. L. Mencken]] cites it as being one of the three [[coon songs]] which "firmly established the term ''coon'' in the American vocabulary".

The song was a musical hit of the day by A. M. Rothschild and Company in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Display Ad 15 -- No Title. (1901, September 15). Chicago Daily Tribune (1872-1963), p. 45.  Retrieved October 6, 2007, from ProQuest Historical Newspapers Chicago Tribune (1849 - 1986) database. (Document ID: 425880041)&lt;/ref&gt;  New York's [[Siegel Cooper Company]] referred to it as one of his greatest hits in April a year later.&lt;ref&gt;Display Ad 9 -- No Title. (1902, April 10). ''New York Times'' (1857-Current file), p. 7.  Retrieved October 6, 2007, from ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851 - 2004) database. (Document ID: 101946057).&lt;/ref&gt; The next month it was sung during "Music on the Piers" in New York, being the first song played at the Metropolitan Avenue pier.&lt;ref&gt;DELAY IN GAMBLING CASES: Moral Value Lost Unless Prosecutions Are Speedy, Jerome Says.. (1902, May 30). ''New York Times'' (1857-Current file), 14.  Retrieved October 6, 2007, from ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851 - 2004) database. (Document ID: 118471848).&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''The Movies That Changed Us: Reflections on the Screen'', [[Nick Clooney]] refers to the song as part of the "hit parade" of popular music one could use to measure the temper of the times when ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' premiered in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;The Movies That Changed Us: Reflections on the Screen (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2003), pp. 285-286.&lt;/ref&gt; The tune is repeatedly referred to in the literature as having the ability to incite violence merely by whistling it in the direction of an African American. It was also [[Marie Dressler|Marie Dressler's]] contribution to the 'coon' genre.&lt;ref&gt;''Marie Dressler: A Biography, With a Listing of Major Stage Performances, a Filmography and a Discography'' (Jefferson NC: McFarland &amp; Company, December 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lottie Gilson]], [[Bert Williams|Williams and Walker]], [[Frances Curran]], [[Hodges and Launchmere]], [[Libby and Bennett]], [[Zoa Matthews]], [[Johnnie Carroll]], [[Clarice Vance]], [[Gerie Gilson]], [[Joe Bonnell]], [[The Eldridges]] and "100 other artists" sang the song with "overwhelming success" according to its sheet music.

The song motivated the creation of the [[Pan-African flag]] in 1920 by the members of the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League]].&lt;ref&gt;"New Flag for Afro-Americans," ''[[Africa Times and Orient Review]]''; 1 (October 1912):134; Cited in ''RACE FIRST: The Ideological and Organizational Struggles of Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association'' (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1987), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a 1927 report of a 1921 speech appearing in the ''[[Negro World]]'' weekly newspaper, [[Marcus Garvey]] was quoted as saying,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garvey|first1=Marcus|title=Honorable Marcus Garvey, Gifted Man of Vision, Sets Out In Unanswerable Terms the Reasons Why Negroes Must Build in Africa|work=Negro World|issue=Vol XXII No. 6|publisher=Universal Negro Improvement Association|date=March 19, 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Show me the race or the nation without a flag, and I will show you a race of people without any pride. Aye! In song and mimicry they have said, "Every race has a flag but the coon." How true! Aye! But that was said of us four years ago. They can't say it now....}}

The lyrics to "Every Race Has a Flag but the Coon" include the musical meme [[Four Eleven Forty Four|"four eleven forty four"]].

'''Fighting in ice hockey''' is an established tradition of [[Ice hockey|the sport]] in North America, with a long history that involves many levels of [[amateur sports|amateur]] and [[Professional sports|professional]] play and includes some notable individual fights.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting is usually performed by [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcers]], or "goons"—players whose role is to fight and intimidate—on a given team,&lt;ref name="Bernstein_xix"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is governed by a complex system of unwritten rules that players, [[Coach (ice hockey)|coaches]], [[Official (ice hockey)|officials]], and the media refer to as "the code".&lt;ref name="Bernstein_xxi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fights are spontaneous, while others are premeditated by the participants.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_31"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; While officials tolerate fighting during hockey games, they impose a variety of [[Penalty (ice hockey)|penalties]] on players who engage in fights.

Unique among North American professional team sports, the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and most minor professional leagues in North America do not [[ejection (sports)|eject]] players outright for fighting&lt;ref name="Bernstein_31"/&gt; (although they may do so for more flagrant violations as part of a fight) but major European and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|collegiate hockey leagues]] do, and multi-game suspensions may be added on top of the ejection.&lt;ref name="NCAA"&gt;{{Harvnb|NCAA|2004|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the vast majority of fights occur in the NHL and other North American professional leagues.

Physical play in hockey, consisting of allowed techniques such as [[Checking (ice hockey)|checking]] and prohibited techniques such as [[elbowing]], [[high-sticking]], and [[Cross-checking (hockey)|cross-checking]], is linked to fighting.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although often a target of criticism, it is a considerable draw for the sport, and some fans attend games primarily to see fights.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_36"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who defend fighting in hockey say that it helps deter other types of rough play, allows teams to protect their star players, and creates a sense of solidarity among teammates.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_xxi"/&gt; The debate over allowing fighting in ice hockey games is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Should The NHL Ban Fighting In Hockey? |url=https://www.theperspective.com/debates/sports/nhl-ban-fighting-hockey/ |publisher=The Perspective |date=14 March 2017 |accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its potentially negative consequences, such as heavier enforcers (or "heavyweights") knocking each other out, administrators at the professional level have no plans to eliminate fighting from the game, as most players consider it essential.&lt;ref name="McIntyre"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pressreader.com/canada/the-province/20070327/282213711371635|title=Fighting part of hockey: Bettman: Canucks players agree with commissioner about the role of fisticuffs|last=McIntyre|first=Gordon|date=27 March 2007|access-date=27 March 2017|journal=[[The Province|The Vancouver Province]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most fans and players&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Question &gt; Should Fighting Be Completely Banished?|publisher=2011/12 Player Poll|url=http://www.playerspoll.ca/results/20112012-results/on-ice/should-fighting-be-completely-banished|accessdate=19 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222131442/http://www.playerspoll.ca/results/20112012-results/on-ice/should-fighting-be-completely-banished|archivedate=22 February 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; oppose eliminating fights from professional hockey games,&lt;ref name="Barrie Examiner"&gt;{{cite news | author = Barrie Examiner | title = Keep fighting, hockey fans say | journal =Barrie Examiner | date = 5 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but considerable opposition to fighting exists and efforts to eliminate it continue.

Fighting has been a part of ice hockey since the sport's rise in popularity in 19th century Canada.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_3"/&gt; There are a number of theories behind the integration of fighting into the game; the most common is that the relative lack of rules in the early history of hockey encouraged physical intimidation and control.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_3"/&gt; Other theories include the poverty and high crime rates of local Canada in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_3"/&gt; The implementation of some features, such as the [[Hockey rink|blue lines]] in 1918, actually encouraged fighting due to the increased level of physical play. Creation of the blue lines allowed forward passing, but only in the neutral zone. Therefore, puck handlers played at close quarters and were subject to a great deal of physical play. The emergence of enforcers, who protected the puck handlers and fought when necessary, followed shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_4"/&gt;

In 1922, the NHL introduced Rule 56, which formally regulated fighting, or "[[Bare-knuckle boxing|fisticuffs]]" as it was called in the official NHL rulebook. Rather than ejecting players from the game, as was the practice in amateur and collegiate hockey, players would be given a [[Penalty (ice hockey)#Types of penalties|five-minute major penalty]].

Although fighting was rarer from the 1920s through the 1960s,&lt;ref name="Kahane160"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kahane and Shmanske|2012|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was often brutal in nature; author Ross Bernstein said of the game's early years that it "was probably more like [[Rugby football|rugby]] on skates than it was modern hockey."&lt;ref name="Bernstein_4"/&gt; Star players were also known to fight for themselves during the [[Original Six]] era, when fewer teams existed than in later years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chambers|first=Mike|title=History of fighting in hockey|work=The Denver Post|date=1 December 2013|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/01/history-of-fighting-in-hockey/|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the [[1967 NHL expansion|NHL's expansion]] in the late 1960s created more roster spots and spread star players more widely throughout the league, enforcers (who usually possess limited overall skill sets) became more common.&lt;ref name="Bernstein 2006 8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple fights during the era received significant media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an NHL preseason game between the [[Boston Bruin]]s and [[St. Louis Blues]] in 1969, Bruins defenceman [[Ted Green]] and Blues left wing [[Wayne Maki]], attacking Green, engaged in a bloody stick-swinging fight that resulted in Green sustaining a skull fracture.&lt;ref name="Bernstein 2006 8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legends of Hockey — NHL Player Search — Player — Wayne Maki|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=13497|publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame|Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum]]|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, [[World Hockey Association]] [[Birmingham Bulls]] enforcer [[Dave Hanson (ice hockey)|Dave Hanson]], known for his 11-year professional career, fought [[Hockey Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Bobby Hull]] and in the process got Hull's wig caught in his knuckles.

Many teams signed enforcers to protect and fight for smaller offensive stars.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fights in the 1990s included the [[Red Wings – Avalanche brawl|Brawl in Hockeytown]] in 1997, in which the [[Colorado Avalanche]] and [[Detroit Red Wings]] engaged in nine fights, including bouts between Darren McCarty and [[Claude Lemieux]] and [[Goaltender|goalies]] [[Patrick Roy]] and [[Mike Vernon (ice hockey)|Mike Vernon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunkak|first=Ashley|title=17 Years Later, A Look Back At The Greatest Fight In Red Wings History|publisher=[[WWJ-TV]]|date=26 March 2014|url=http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2014/03/26/17-years-later-a-look-back-at-the-greatest-fight-in-red-wings-history/|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, a game between the Avalanche and Red Wings involved a fight between goaltenders [[Chris Osgood]] and Roy after which they received minor, major, and game misconduct penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHL Recap (Colorado-Detroit)|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/scoreboards/1998/04/01/recap.detroit.colorado.html|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=2 April 1998|accessdate = 30 October 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619203307/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/scoreboards/1998/04/01/recap.detroit.colorado.html|archivedate=19 June 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a Philadelphia Flyers – [[Ottawa Senators]] [[Flyers–Senators brawl|game]] resulted in five consecutive brawls in the closing minutes of the game, including fights between many players who are not known as enforcers and a fight between Flyers goalie [[Robert Esche]] and Senators goalie [[Patrick Lalime]]. The game ended with an NHL record 419 penalty minutes, and an NHL record 20 players were ejected, leaving five players on the team benches.  The officials took 90 minutes to sort out the penalties that each team had received.&lt;ref name="Maaddi"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Maaddi | first=Rob | title = Flyers bully Senators in 5-3 victory | work = USA Today | url = https://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/games/2004-03-06-philly-ottawa_x.htm | accessdate = 15 April 2007 | date=6 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2009–10, the number of fights in the NHL declined to .58 per game. A further decrease in the frequency of fighting happened over the next five seasons. The 2014–15 season had 0.32 fights per game, as teams placed a greater emphasis on skating ability and fewer young players became enforcers.&lt;ref name="decline"/&gt;

Since the 1970s, three rules have curtailed the number and scope of fights in the NHL. In 1971, the league created the "Third Man In" rule which attempts to eliminate the [[bench-clearing brawl]] by providing for the ejection of the first player who joins a fight already in progress, unless a match penalty is being assessed to a player already engaged in that fight.&lt;ref name="NHL_Rulebook_46"&gt;{{Harvnb|NHL Rulebook 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another rule automatically suspends the first player from each team that leaves the bench to join a fight when it is not their shift.&lt;ref name="NHL_Rulebook_70"&gt;{{Harvnb|NHL Rulebook 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the "Instigator" rule, which adds an additional two-minute minor penalty to the player who starts a fight,&lt;ref name="NHL_Rulebook_46"/&gt; was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/2008-2009/the_code/timeline.html|title=Fighting in Hockey: A Timeline|date=27 February 2009|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=19 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304123020/http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/2008-2009/the_code/timeline.html|archivedate=4 March 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules and penalties==
&lt;!-- [[Image:Frölunda Västerås U18 Fight(2).jpg|thumb|right|A fight during a [[Frölunda HC]] – [[VIK Västerås HK]] game]] --&gt;
Rules of the NHL, the North American junior leagues, and other North American professional minor leagues punish fighting with a five-minute major penalty.&lt;ref name="broke"&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldschmied and Espindola|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; What separates these leagues from other major North American sports leagues is that they do not eject players simply for participating in a fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kahane and Shmanske|2012|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, fighting is frequently punishable by ejection in European leagues and in Olympic competition.&lt;ref name="broke"/&gt;

The rulebooks of the NHL and other professional leagues contain specific rules for fighting. These rules state that at the initiation of a fight, both players must definitely drop their sticks so as not to use them as a weapon. Players must also "drop" or shake off their protective gloves to fight bare-knuckled, as the hard leather and plastic of hockey gloves would increase the effect of landed blows. Players should not remove their own helmet before engaging in a fight due to risk of head injury or else both of the opposing players get an extra two penalty minutes. Players must also heed a referee warning to end a fight once the opponents have been separated. Failure to adhere to any of these rules results in an immediate game misconduct penalty and the possibility of fines and suspension from future games.&lt;ref name="NHL_Rulebook_46"/&gt; In the NHL, when a player is fined, his lost pay goes towards the NHL emergency assistance fund. A fined coach's lost pay goes to the NHL Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/2006-11-23-notebook_x.htm |title=NHL suspends three players, fines two coaches for Caps-Thrashers melee |author=Associated Press |work=[[USA Today]] |date=23 November 2006 |accessdate=24 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North American professional leagues===
[[Image:ThorntonfightingBrookbank.jpg|thumb|[[Shawn Thornton]] (left) fighting [[Wade Brookbank]] (right)]]
In the NHL, [[American Hockey League]] (AHL), [[ECHL]], [[Southern Professional Hockey League]], and other notable minor leagues, officials punish combatants with five-minute major penalties for fighting (hence the phrase "five for fighting"). A player is automatically ejected and suspended if the player tries to leave the bench to join a fight, or for using weapons of any kind (such as using a skate to kick an opponent, using a stick to hit an opponent, wrapping tape around one's hands, or spitting), as they can cause serious injury. A player who receives two instigator penalties or participates in three fights in a single game is also ejected automatically. Furthermore, his coach can be suspended up to ten games for allowing players to leave the bench to join a fight.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NHL_Rulebook_70"/&gt;

A player who commits three major penalties (including fighting) during a game is automatically ejected, suspended, and fined. A player ejected for three major penalties in a game, or for use of weapons, cannot be replaced for five minutes.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_4"/&gt; In 2003, the ECHL added an ejection, fine, and suspension of an additional game for any player charged as an instigator of a fight during the final five minutes of the third period or any overtime. The NHL and AHL adopted the rule in 2005–06, and the NHL includes a fine against the ejected player's head coach.&lt;ref name="NHL_Rulebook_70"/&gt;

===Collegiate, European, and Olympic===
In Division I and Division III [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) hockey, the fighters are given a Game Disqualification, which is an ejection from the game and a suspension for as many games as the player has accrued Game Disqualifications during the course of a season. For example, if a player engages in a fight having already received a Game Disqualification earlier in the season, he is ejected from that game and suspended for his team's next two games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|NCAA|2004|pp=37–38, 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; This automatic suspension has made fighting in college hockey relatively rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chambers|first=Mike|title=Rules against fighting in NCAA hockey don't deter cheap shots|work=The Denver Post|date=1 December 2013|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/01/rules-against-fighting-in-ncaa-hockey-dont-deter-cheap-shots/|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Match penalty (the player is ejected from the game and another player serves 5 minutes in addition to any other penalties imposed in the penalty box) for a player who starts fisticuffs.
* Minor penalty (2 minutes) for a player who retaliates with a blow or attempted blow.
* Game misconduct penalty (ejection from the game) in addition to any other penalties for any player who is the first to intervene in fisticuffs which are already in progress.
* Double minor penalty (4 minutes), major penalty and game misconduct penalty (5 minutes and ejection from the game), or match penalty (at the discretion of the referee) for a player who continues fisticuffs after being told by officials to stop.
* Misconduct penalty (10 minutes; second misconduct penalty in one game means automatic ejection) for a player who intentionally takes off his gloves in fisticuffs.

Despite the bans, there have been fights in European leagues. In 2001, a game between the [[Nottingham Panthers]] and the [[Sheffield Steelers]] in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Ice Hockey Superleague|Superleague]] saw "some of the worst scenes of violence seen at a British ice hockey rink".&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; When Sheffield enforcer [[Dennis Vial]] crosschecked Nottingham forward Greg Hadden, Panthers enforcer [[Barry Nieckar]] subsequently fought with Vial, which eventually escalated into a 36-man [[Bench-clearing brawl|bench-clearing brawl]]. Referee Moray Hanson sent both teams to their locker rooms and delayed the game for 45 minutes while tempers cooled and the officials sorted out the penalties. Eight players and both coaches were ejected, and a British record total of 404 penalty minutes were incurred during the second period. The league handed out 30 games in suspensions to four players and Steelers' coach Mike Blaisdell and a total of £8,400 in fines.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news| author = BBC | title = Brawl taints Panthers' victory | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1163606.stm | accessdate = 29 December 2006 | publisher = bbc.co.uk | date=10 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = CBC | title = British league suspends Canadian hockey brawlers | url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/02/14/brawlers010214.html | accessdate = 24 December 2007 | publisher = cbc.ca | date=14 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/low/other_sports/1171302.stm|title=BBC Sport – Other Sports – League punishes teams over brawl|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia's [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL) had a bench-clearing brawl between [[Vityaz Chekhov]] and [[Avangard Omsk]] in 2010. Officials were forced to abandon the game as there were only four players left. Thirty-three players and both teams' coaches were ejected, and a world record total of 707 penalty minutes were incurred during the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Lenta.ru | title = Матч КХЛ был сорван массовой дракой хоккеистов | url = http://www.lenta.ru/news/2010/01/09/scuffle/ | accessdate = 9 January 2010 | publisher = lenta.ru | year = 2010 | language = Russian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.khl.ru/news/2010/1/9/23770.html|title=This is hockey? |publisher=KHL.ru|date=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KHL imposed fines totaling 5.7 million rubles ($191,000), suspended seven players, and counted the game as a 5–0 defeat for both teams, with no points being awarded.&lt;ref name="bothteamslose"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.khl.ru/news/2010/1/10/23771.html|title=Both teams lose|publisher=KHL.ru|date=10 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Punch-up in Piestany]] was a notable instance of fighting in international play. A 1987 [[World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]] game between Canada and the Soviet Union was the scene of a bench-clearing brawl that lasted 20 minutes and prompted officials to turn off the arena lights in an attempt to stop it, forcing the IIHF to declare the game null and void. The fighting was particularly dangerous as fighting was a surprise and a custom unknown to the Soviet players, some of whom escalated the fighting beyond what was considered acceptable in North America. Both teams were ejected from the tournament, costing Canada an assured medal, and the Soviet team was barred from the end-of-tournament dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1987: Canada, USSR brawl at World Junior Hockey Tournament|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/1987-punch-up-in-piestany|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcers==
{{Main article|Enforcer (ice hockey)}}
The role of "enforcer" on a hockey team is unofficial.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_xix" /&gt; Enforcers occasionally play regular shifts like other players, but their primary role is deterring opposing players from rough play. Coaches often send enforcers out when opposing enforcers are on the ice or any time when it is necessary to check excessively physical play by the opposing team.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_34"/&gt; Enforcers, particularly those with questionable playing skills, can be colloquially referred to as goons (a term also occasionally used for a related position, the [[pest (ice hockey)|pest]], who may not fight but will agitate an opponent with rough play and goad the opponent into a fight).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Wagenheim|first=Jeff|title=As NHL enforcers fade, tough guys will always be needed|magazine=Sports Illustrated|date=14 October 2014|url=https://www.si.com/nhl/2014/10/13/vanishing-enforcers-tough-guys-hockey-fights|accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
There are many reasons for fights during a hockey game. Some reasons are related to game play, such as retaliation, momentum-building, intimidation, deterrence, attempting to draw "reaction penalties", and protecting star players. There are also some personal reasons such as retribution for past incidents, bad blood between players, and simple job security for enforcers.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fights often start in response to an opponent's rough play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|pp=34–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game-related reasons===
[[Image:hockeyfight.JPG|thumb|right|A large fight in an [[Ontario Hockey League|OHL]] hockey game between the [[Sudbury Wolves]] and [[Ottawa 67s]]]]

Of the many reasons for fighting, the foremost is retaliation.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_34"/&gt; When players engage in play that members of the opposing team consider unscrupulous, a fight can ensue. The fight may be between the assailant and the victim, between the assailant and an enforcer from the victim's team, or between opposing enforcers. Fights that occur for retaliation purposes can be in immediate response to an on-ice incident, to incidents from earlier in the game, or to actions from past games.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_34"/&gt; Enforcers who intend to start a fight have to consider their timing due to the Instigator rule. For example, putting the opposing team on a [[Power play (sporting term)|power play]] due to penalties incurred from fighting is less advisable when the game is close.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_35"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enforcers sometimes start fights to build game momentum and provide a psychological advantage over the opposing team. These fights usually involve two enforcers, but may involve any player who is agitating the opposition.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_36"/&gt; This type of fight raises morale on the team of the player who wins, and often excites the home crowd. For that reason, it can also be a gamble to start a fight for momentum; if an enforcer loses the fight, the momentum can swing the wrong way.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_38"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intimidation is an important element of a hockey game&lt;ref name="Bernstein_xix" /&gt; and some enforcers start fights just to intimidate opposing players in hopes that they will refrain from agitating skilled players.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the late 1950s, [[Gordie Howe]] helped establish himself as an enforcer by defeating [[Lou Fontinato]], a notable tough guy who tallied over 1,200 penalty minutes in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Legends of Hockey | year = 2007 | title = Lou Fontinato | journal = Legends of Hockey | url = http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=12622 | accessdate = 25 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fontinato suffered a broken nose from the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=Schwartz | first=Larry | year = 2007 | title = The ageless wonder | publisher = [[ESPN]] | url = http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014262.html | accessdate = 7 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that incident, Howe got a lot more space on the ice and was able to score many goals over the span of his career because he intimidated other players.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_42"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, games in European professional leagues are known to be less violent than North American games because fighting is discouraged in Europe by ejection and heavy fines. Since the penalties for fighting are so severe, the enforcers are less able to intimidate opposing players with fighting and said players take more liberties on the ice.&lt;ref name="McIntyre"/&gt;

For teams that face each other frequently, players may fight just to send the message to the opposing players that they will be the target of agitation or aggression in future games.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_46"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teams that are losing by a considerable margin often start these fights near the end of the game when they have nothing to lose.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_47"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enforcers may start fights with more skilled players to draw what is called a "reaction penalty", an undisciplined reaction to aggressive play on the part of the enforcer. This practice is also known to be difficult due to the Instigator rule.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_48"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reason is the protection of star players. Fighting within the game can also send a message to players and coaches from other teams that cheap shots, dirty plays, and targeting specific players will not be tolerated and there will be consequences involved. Fighting can provide retribution for a team's player getting targeted or injured. Overall, fighting is sometimes seen as a beneficial policing that the game needs to keep players in line. Over the history of hockey, many enforcers have been signed simply to protect players like Gretzky, who was protected by [[Dave Semenko]], [[Marty McSorley]], and others, and [[Brett Hull]], who was protected by [[Kelly Chase]] and others.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_53"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many believe that without players protecting each other, referees would affect the game play by having to call more penalties, and the league would have to suspend players for longer periods.&lt;ref name="scott20150115"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/01/bobby-farnham-pittsburgh-penguins-longform | title=The Ivy Leaguer who fought his way to the NHL | work=USA Today | date=15 January 2015 | accessdate=15 January 2015 | author=Scott, Nate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal reasons===
Many young enforcers need to establish their role early in their career to avoid losing their jobs.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_50"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the [[Farm team|farm systems]] that most professional hockey leagues use, enforcers who get a chance to play at the level above their current one (for example, an AHL player getting a chance to play in an NHL game) need to show other players, coaches, and fans that they are worthy of the enforcer role on the team.&lt;ref name="Botterill"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Botterill | first=Cal | year = 2004 | title = The Psychology of Professional Hockey | journal = Athletic Insight | publisher = University of Winnipeg | url = http://www.athleticinsight.com/Vol6Iss2/ProfessionalHockey.htm | accessdate = 9 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players and coaches enjoy being with enforcers who fight for their teams, not for themselves.{{r|scott20150115}}

There are also times when players and even entire teams carry on personal rivalries that have little to do with individual games; fights frequently occur for no other reason.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rivalry that produced many fights was between the [[National Hockey League rivalries#Colorado Avalanche vs. Detroit Red Wings|Detroit Red Wings and the Colorado Avalanche during the 1990s]].&lt;ref name="Dater_Feud"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dater|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on game==
Statistics indicate that fights are detrimental to teams' play, or have inconsequential benefits. Since the 1979–80 season, teams in the bottom three of fighting-related major penalties have finished at the top of the regular-season standings 10 times and have won the Stanley Cup 11 times, while teams in the top three have won the regular season and Stanley Cup only twice each. One statistical analysis calculated that winning a fight benefited a team by about 1/80th of a win in the standings. Two others showed that fights increase scoring, but do so evenly for both teams so do not significantly affect wins.&lt;ref name="klein20120122"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/sports/hockey/flying-fists-dont-add-up-to-victories.html | title=Numbers Indicate That Skill Usually Packs a Bigger Punch Than Fists | work=The New York Times | date=22 January 2012 | accessdate=18 June 2012 | author=Klein, Jeff Z. | page=SP9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efforts to ban fighting==
The Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine announced in ''Position Statement'' in 1988 that "Fighting does cause injuries, which range from fractures of the hands and face to lacerations and eye injuries. At present, it is an endemic and ritualized blot on the reputation of the North American game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kissick|first=James|title=Position Statement: Violence and Injuries in Ice Hockey|publisher=Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine|year=2007|origyear=1988|url=http://casem-acmse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/violence-in-hockey-20071.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=19 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114122248/http://casem-acmse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/violence-in-hockey-20071.pdf|archive-date=2017-01-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism often arises after single acts of violence committed during fights. For example, on March 21, 2007, [[Colton Orr]] of the [[New York Rangers]] fought with [[Todd Fedoruk]] of the Philadelphia Flyers and ended up knocking Fedoruk [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]]. Fedoruk already had titanium plates in his face from a fight earlier in the season with [[Derek Boogaard]]. The resulting media coverage of the incident renewed calls for a fighting ban.&lt;ref name="Dater"&gt;{{cite news | last=Dater | first=Adrian | title = Debate? Let's drop the gloves | journal = [[The Denver Post]] | url = http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_5514998 | date = 25 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some players acknowledge that there is no harm in discussing the issue;&lt;ref name="Lebrun"&gt;{{cite news | last=Lebrun | first=Pierre | title = Fighting the good fight | journal = [[Edmonton Sun]] | date = 24 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, most players and administrators continue to insist that fighting stay as a permanent element of organized ice hockey.&lt;ref name="Dater"/&gt; Some league administrators, such as former NHL senior vice-president and director of hockey operations [[Colin Campbell (ice hockey executive)|Colin Campbell]], have been circulating the idea of banning fighting in response to incidents such as the Fedoruk–Orr fight.&lt;ref name="Naylor"&gt;{{cite news | last=Naylor | first=David | title = Fight On? | journal = The Globe and Mail | date = 23 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports journalists have articulated the idea with increasing frequency that fighting adds nothing to the sport and should be banned. Among the reasons they cite are that it is unsportsmanlike,&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite news | last=Wilson | first=P. | title = Hockey brawls ruin a once grand game | journal = [[Windsor Star]] | date = 27 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a "knee-jerk" reaction that detracts from the skillful aspects of the game,&lt;ref name="Jenkinson"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Jenkinson | first=Mike | title = NHL no place for fighting | journal = [[Ottawa Sun]] | date = 1 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is simply a waste of time.&lt;ref name="Gough"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Gough | first=David | title = Fighting not necessary for hockey | journal = Courier Press (Wallaceburg, Ontario) | date = 4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Journal of Sport and Social Issues''' Ryan T. Lewinson and Oscar E. Palma believe that fighting shows a lack of discipline on the part of participants, as well as a lack of fairness in certain cases, including when fighters have a size disparity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewinson and Palma|2012|pp=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, supporters of fighting say it provides a means of security for players, that fighting is a tool players use to keep opposing players in check; essentially allowing players to police which hits and dirty plays are unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kuc|first=Chris|title=Why is fighting vanishing from the NHL?|work=The Chicago Tribune|date=6 February 2016|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/hockey/blackhawks/ct-hockey-fighting-fading-spt-0207-20160206-story.html|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various politicians and hockey figures have expressed opposition to fighting. In 2012, [[David Johnston]], the [[Governor General of Canada]], said that fighting should not be part of the sport.&lt;ref name="govgen"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2012/01/26/pol-gg-hockey-fighting-pnp.html | title=Fighting has no place in hockey, GG says | publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date=26 January 2012 | accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; IIHF president [[Rene Fasel]] has protested against fighting, deeming it "[[Neanderthal]] behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LeBrun|first=Pierre|title=Hockey community debates merits of fighting|work=The Globe and Mail|date=23 March 2007|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey-community-debates-merits-of-fighting/article1072626/|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wayne Gretzky]], considered by many to be the greatest hockey player of all time, has often spoken out against fisticuffs, although he expressed support for fighting in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burstyn|1999|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NHL Commissioner [[Gary Bettman]], at a 2007 press conference broadcast on CBC Sports, said, "Fighting has always had a role in the game&amp;nbsp;... from a player safety standpoint, what happens in fighting is something we need to look at just as we need to look at hits to the head. But we're not looking to have a debate on whether fighting is good or bad or should be part of the game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2007/03/26/bettman-figting.html | work=[[CBC News]] | title=Fighting not up for debate: Bettman | date=26 March 2007 | accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community members often become involved in the debate over banning fighting. In December 2006, a [[school board]] trustee in [[London, Ontario]] attended a [[London Knights]] game and was shocked by the fighting and by the crowd's positive reaction to it.  This experience led him to organize an ongoing effort to ban fighting in the [[Ontario Hockey League]], where the Knights compete, by attempting to gain the support of other school boards and by writing letters to OHL administrators.&lt;ref name="Rodrigues"/&gt; On the advice of its [[Medical Health Officer]], the Middlesex-London Health board has supported recommendations to ban fighting across amateur hockey and to increase disciplinary measures to ensure deterrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Pollett | first=Graham L. | title = Correspondence | journal = Middlesex-London Health Unit | date = 9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known death directly related to a hockey fight occurred when Don Sanderson of the [[Whitby Dunlops]], a top-tier senior amateur team in Ontario's [[Major League Hockey]], died in January 2009, a month after sustaining a head injury during a fight: Sanderson's helmet came off during the fight, and when he fell to the ice, he hit his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/02/senior-player-dies-from-injury-sustained-in-on-ice-fight/|title=Senior Player Dies From Injury Sustained in On-Ice Fight|last=Hackel|first=Stu |author2=Klein, Jeff Z. |date=2 January 2009|work=The New York Times|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His death renewed calls to ban fighting among critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/comment/article/562096|title=Editorial: Fighting has no place in hockey|last=Bishop|first=Dr. Pat |date=6 January 2009|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction, the league has stated that they are reviewing the players' use of helmets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespec.com/News/BreakingNews/article/489744|title=Hockey player's death prompts helmet questions|date=2 January 2009|work=The Hamilton Spectator|agency=Canadian Press|accessdate=7 January 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121194213/http://www.thespec.com/News/BreakingNews/article/489744|archivedate=21 January 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighters such as [[Bob Probert]] and Boogaard have been posthumously diagnosed with [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]], a [[degenerative disease]] of the brain caused by repeated brain trauma. While the NHL took steps to limit head trauma from blindslide hits, it was criticized for doing nothing to reduce fighting, which consists of repeated deliberate blows to the head.&lt;ref name="bad"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/sports/hockey/derek-boogaard-a-brain-going-bad.html?pagewanted=1&amp;hp "Derek Boogard - A Brain 'Going Bad'"], ''The New York Times'', 5 December 2011. Part 3 of a three-part series chronicling Boogard's life and the posthumous research on his brain. Retrieved 5 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown if Boogaard's death was mainly attributed from his repeated head trauma from fighting and hits or from a possible addiction to painkillers while simultaneously abusing alcohol.&lt;ref name="bad"/&gt; His brain has been sent to Boston University for further testing.&lt;ref name="bad"/&gt;

Beginning in the 2016–17 season, the American Hockey League will impose a fighting major counter, similar to the [[National Basketball Association]]'s unsportsmanlike technical foul counter and soccer's accumulated cards.  A player who collects ten major penalties for fighting during the season will be suspended one game, and will be suspended one game for each fighting major for the next three penalties (the 11th, 12th, and 13th fighting majors).  A player is suspended two games for his 14th and subsequent major penalty for fighting.  If one player involved in the fight is charged with an instigator penalty, the opponent will not have the fighting major count towards suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theahl.com/board-of-governors-concludes-annual-meeting-p202959 |title=Board of Governors Concludes Annual Meeting|date=7 July 2016 |publisher=American Hockey League|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etiquette==
There are several informal rules governing fighting in ice hockey that players rarely discuss but take quite seriously.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_56"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important aspect of this etiquette is that opposing enforcers must agree to a fight, usually via a verbal or physical exchange on the ice. This agreement helps both players avoid being given an instigator penalty, and helps keep unwilling participants out of fights.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_57"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enforcers typically only fight each other, with only the occasional spontaneous fight breaking out between one or two opponents who do not usually fight.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_60"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a high degree of respect among enforcers as well; they will respect a rival who declines a fight because he is playing with injuries, a frequent occurrence, because enforcers consider winning a fight with an injured opponent to be an empty victory.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_100"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also known as granting a "free pass".&lt;ref name="Bernstein_65"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enforcer [[Darren McCarty]] described fighters as being divided into "heavyweights" and "light heavyweights", and said that players in the former category "end up dancing with some guys who could end (their) career with a single punch."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCarty and Allen|2014|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-standing rivalries result in numerous rematches, especially if one of the enforcers has to decline an invitation to fight during a given game. This is one of the reasons that enforcers may fight at the beginning of a game, when nothing obvious has happened to agitate the opponents.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_69"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it is bad etiquette to try to initiate a fight with an enforcer who is near the end of his shift, since the more rested player will have an obvious advantage.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_70"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important aspect of etiquette is simply fighting fairly and cleanly. Fairness is maintained by not wearing equipment that could injure the opposing fighter, such as face shields, gloves, or masks,&lt;ref name="Bernstein_74"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and not assaulting referees or linesmen.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_73"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, whatever the outcome of the fight, etiquette dictates that players who choose to fight win and lose those fights gracefully. Otherwise, they risk losing the respect of their teammates and fans.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_76"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sportsmanship is also an important aspect when it comes to fights. While an enforcer may start a fight in response to foul play, it is generally not acceptable to start a fight to retaliate against an opponent who scored fairly.

==Tactics==
Fighting tactics are governed by several actual rules and enforcers will also adopt informal tactics particular to their style and personality. One tactic adopted by players is known as "going for it", in which the player puts his head down and just throws as many punches as he can, as fast as he can. In the process, that player takes as many punches as he delivers, although some of them are to the hard forehead. Fighters usually must keep one hand on their opponent's jersey since the ice surface makes maintaining balance very difficult. For this reason, the majority of a hockey fight consists of the players holding on with one hand and punching with the other.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include Gordie Howe's tactic of holding the sweater of his opponent right around the armpit of his preferred punching arm so as to impede his movement. Probert, of the [[Detroit Red Wings]] and [[Chicago Blackhawks]], was known to allow his opponents to punch until they showed signs of tiring, at which time he would take over and usually dominate the fight. Some consider long-time [[Buffalo Sabres]] enforcer [[Rob Ray]] to be the reason that hockey jerseys are now equipped with tie-down straps ("fight straps") that prevent their removal; he would always remove his jersey during fights so his opponents would have nothing to grab on to. This is commonly referred to as the "Rob Ray Rule".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Jim|title=Ray: 'It's not something I planned'|publisher=ESPN|date=19 January 2004|url=http://espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?id=1711851&amp;columnist=kelley_jim|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein_63"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Officials' role==
Throughout a game, the referee and linesmen have a role in preventing fights through the way they are managing the game—calling penalties, breaking up scuffles before they escalate, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peters|first=Chris|title=Report: NHL wants linesmen to break up more fights before they start|publisher=CBS Sports|date=15 October 2014|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/news/report-nhl-wants-linesmen-to-break-up-more-fights-before-they-start/|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite an official's best efforts, though, fights do occur and once they do, the referee and linesmen have a certain set of responsibilities to follow in order to safely break up the fight. None of these responsibilities are written in the NHL's rule book, but often are guided by "common sense", according to officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crowe|first=Jerry|title=NHL Fight Time Never Fun for Linesmen Who Must Restore Order|work=Los Angeles Times|date=26 March 1988|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-03-26/sports/sp-206_1_fight|accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blackhawks-Flames scrum.JPG|thumb|Officials trying to break up a brawl between [[Calgary Flames]] and [[Chicago Blackhawks]]]]
In a single fight situation the linesmen will communicate with each other as to which player they will take during the fight, clear out any sticks, gloves, or other equipment that has been dropped and wait for a safe time to enter the fight, which they will do together.  If both players are still standing while the linesmen enter, the linesmen will approach from each side (never from behind), bring their arms over the combatants' arms and wrap them around, pushing downwards and breaking the players apart. If the players have fallen, the linesmen will approach from the side (never over the skates), getting in between the two players. One linesman will use his body to shield the player on the bottom from the other player while his partner will remove the top player from the fight. Most linesmen will allow a fight to run its course for their own safety, but will enter a fight regardless if one player has gained a significant advantage over his opponent. Once the players have been broken up, the linesmen then escort the players off the ice. During this time the referee will keep other players from entering the fight by sending them to a neutral area on the ice and then watching the fight and assessing any other penalties that occur.&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/Sport/OPM_English.pdf|title=Officiating Procedures Manual|accessdate=2 March 2009|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a multiple fight situation the linesmen will normally break up fights together, one fight at a time using the same procedures for a single fight. The linesmen will communicate with each other which fight to break up. In a multiple fight situation the referee will stand in an area of the ice where he/she can have a full view of all the players and will write down—on a pad of paper commonly known as a "riot pad"—the numbers of the players that are involved in the fights, watching for situations that warrant additional penalties, such as players removing opponents' helmets, players participating in a second fight, players leaving a bench to participate in a fight, or third players into a fight. The referee will not normally break up a fight unless the linesmen need assistance, or a fight is occurring where a player has gained a significant advantage over the other player, leading to concerns of significant injury.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;

{{Main article|Modernization theory}}
This article delineates the '''history of modernisation theory'''. Modernisation refers to a model of a progressive transition from a 'pre-modern' or '[[Traditional society|traditional]]' to a 'modern' [[society]]. The theory looks at the internal factors of a country while assuming that, with assistance, "traditional" countries can be brought to development in the same manner more developed countries have. Modernisation theory attempts to identify the social variables that contribute to [[social progress]] and development of societies, and seeks to explain the process of [[social evolution]]. Modernisation theory is subject to criticism originating among socialist and free-market ideologies, [[World-systems theory|world-systems]] theorists, [[globalisation]] theorists and [[dependency theory|dependency]] theorists among others. Modernisation theory not only stresses the process of change, but also the responses to that change. It also looks at internal dynamics while referring to social and cultural structures and the adaptation of new technologies. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Earliest expressions of the theory ==
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Émile Durkheim]]

The basic principles of Modernisation theory can be derived from the [[Idea of Progress]], which emerged in the 18th century [[Age of Enlightenment]] with the idea that people themselves could develop and change their society. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The French philosopher [[Marquis de Condorcet]] was involved in the origins of the theory with the idea that technological advancements and economic changes can enable changes in moral and cultural values. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Condorcet was the first to make the connection between economic and social development and to suggest that there can be continuous progress and improvement in human affairs.&lt;ref name="Gilman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilman|first1=Nils|title=Modernization theory : its origins and rise in Cold War America|date=2003|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-7399-7|edition=Johns Hopkins pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logic of this view implies that new processes and improvements are continually needed to keep pace with a constantly changing world. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Furthermore, Condorcet advocated technological advancement as a means of giving people further control over their environments, arguing that technological progress would eventually spur social progress. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In addition to [[social structure]] and the evolution of societies, the French [[sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] developed the concept of [[Functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]], which stresses the interdependence of the institutions of a society and their interaction in maintaining cultural and social unity. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} His most famous work is ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'', which described mechanisms for the maintenance of [[social order]] and the ways in which primitive societies might make the transition to becoming more economically advanced industrial societies. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Durkheim suggested that in a capitalist society, with a complex division of labour, economic regulation would be needed to maintain order. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} He stressed that the major transition from a primitive social order to a more advanced industrial society could otherwise bring crisis and disorder. Durkheim furthermore developed the idea of [[social evolution]], which was coined by [[Herbert Spencer]], which indicates how societies and cultures develop over time; for Durkheim, social evolution is like biological evolution with reference to the development of its components. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} As with living organisms and species, societies progress through several stages, generally beginning at a simple level and developing toward a more complex level of organisation. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Societies adapt to surrounding environments, but also interact with other societies, which further contributes to progress and development. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
Modern sociology evolved in part as a reaction to the problems associated with [[modernity]], such as [[industrialisation]] and the process of [[rationalization (sociology)|'rationalisation']]. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Modernisation theory emerged further in the late 19th century and was especially popular among scholars in the mid-20th century. One notable advocate was Harvard sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] whose ''Mandarins of the Future'' (2003) stressed the importance of societies remaining open to change and saw reactionary forces as restricting development. Maintaining tradition for tradition's sake was thought to be harmful to progress and development.&lt;ref name="khan 162-164"&gt;Khan, p. 162–164.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of modernisation tend to fall into two camps, optimists and pessimists. The former view holds that what some see as a setback for the theory (events such as the [[Iranian Revolution]] or the persistence of instability in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]) are invariably temporary setbacks &lt;ref&gt;Brugger and Hannan, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; on the road to progress. Pessimists argue that certain 'non-modern' areas of the world are incapable of becoming modern.&lt;ref name="Macionis 953"&gt;Macionis, p. 953.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eminent sociologist [[Max Weber]] also made important contributions to development theory. Weber's concept of "rationalisation" was mobilised by those who held that the most important factor behind modernisation was the growth of rationality as a core value. Normally rationality denotes the universally available logic underpinning thought and deliberation in a particular society. Most theorists consider it indispensable for the modernisation process. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Rationality allows people to think in new and innovative ways; innovation is thus coeval with modernisation.

== Contributors ==

Among the academics who contributed much to this theory are [[Walt Whitman Rostow|W. W. Rostow]], who in his ''The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto'' (1960) concentrates on the [[economic system]] side of the modernisation, trying to show factors needed for a country to reach the path to modernisation in his [[Rostovian take-off model]]. [[David Apter]] concentrated on the [[political system]] and [[history of democracy]], researching the connection between [[democracy]], good [[governance]] and efficiency and modernisation. [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] in "Some Social Requisites of Democracy" (1959) argued that economic development sets off a series of profound social changes that together tend to produce democracy. [[David McClelland]] (''The Achieving Society'', 1967) approached this subject from the [[psychology|psychological]] perspective, with his [[motivation]]s theory, arguing that modernisation cannot happen until a given society values innovation, striving for improvement and entrepreneurship. Alex Inkeles (''Becoming Modern'', 1974) similarly creates a model of ''modern personality'', which needs to be independent, active, interested in public policies and cultural matters, open for new experiences, rational and being able to create long-term plans for the future. [[Edward Said]]'s ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978) interprets modernisation from the point of view of societies that are quickly and radically transformed. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Case studies ==

===United States===
[[File:American Progress (John Gast painting).jpg|thumb|300px|This painting (circa 1872) by [[John Gast (painter)|John Gast]] called ''American Progress'', is an allegorical representation of the modernisation of the new west. Here [[Historical Columbia|Columbia]], a personification of the United States, leads civilisation westward with American settlers, stringing telegraph wire as she sweeps west; she holds a school book. The different stages of economic activity of the pioneers are highlighted and, especially, the changing forms of transportation. The Native Americans and wild animals flee.]]
The [[Progressive Era|Progressives in the United States in the early 20th century]] were avid modernisers. They believed in [[science]], technology, expertise—and especially education—as the grand solution to society's weaknesses. Characteristics of progressivism included a favorable attitude toward urban-industrial society, belief in mankind's ability to improve the environment and conditions of life, belief in obligation to intervene in economic and social affairs, and a belief in the ability of experts and in efficiency of government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Buenker, and KABASO.S.MUYA. ''Progressivism'' (1986); Maureen Flanagan, ''America Reformed: Progressives and Progressivisms, 1890s-1920s'' (2007); Modernisation theory exerts a "powerful influence" on historians dealing with the 1896-1916 era, asserts Martin J. Sklar, ''The United States as a developing country'' (1992) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Monroe, a professor of history at Columbia University, was a member of [[The Inquiry]]—a team of American experts at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. He drew on his experience in the Philippines to assess the educational needs of developing areas such as Albania, Turkey and central Africa. Presenting educational development as instrumental to nation-building and socioeconomic development, Monroe recommended the implementation of a progressive curriculum - with an emphasis on practical, adult, and teacher training - in a national system of education, as a basis for self-development, except in Africa. His approach shaped American cooperation with developing countries in the 1920s and modernisation efforts during the 1920s-1930s.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Ment, "Education, nation‐building and modernisation after World War I: American ideas for the Peace Conference," ''Paedagogica Historica,'' Feb 2005, Vol. 41 Issue 1/2, pp 159-177&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany's "Sonderweg"===
{{main article|Sonderweg}}
[[Jürgen Kocka|Kocka]] (1988) and Sheri Berman are historians who emphasise the central importance of a German ''[[Sonderweg]]'' ("special path") or "exceptionalism" as the root of [[Nazism]] and the German catastrophe in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Sheri Berman, "Modernisation in Historical Perspective: The Case of Imperial Germany," ''World Politics,'' Volume 53, Number 3, April 2001, pp. 431-462 {{doi|10.1353/wp.2001.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fritz Fischer]] and his students emphasised [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|Germany’s primary guilt for causing World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Kocka, "German History before Hitler: The Debate about the German 'Sonderweg.'" ''Journal of Contemporary History,''  Jan 1988, Vol. 23#1, pp 3-16 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/260865 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], a leader of the [[Bielefeld School]] of social history, places the origins of Germany's path to disaster in the 1860s-1870s, when economic modernisation took place, but political modernisation did not happen and the old Prussian rural elite remained in firm control of the army, diplomacy and the civil service.  Traditional, aristocratic, premodern society battled an emerging capitalist, bourgeois, modernising society. Recognising the importance of modernising forces in industry and the economy and in the cultural realm, Wehler argues that reactionary traditionalism dominated the political hierarchy of power in Germany, as well as social mentalities and in class relations (Klassenhabitus).  The catastrophic German politics between 1914 and 1945 are interpreted in terms of a delayed modernisation of its political structures. At the core of Wehler's interpretation is his treatment of "the middle class" and "revolution," each of which was instrumental in shaping the 20th century. Wehler's examination of Nazi rule is shaped by his concept of "charismatic domination," which focuses heavily on [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;Wehler, ''Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte: Vom Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges bis zur Gründung der Beiden Deutschen Staaten 1914-1949'' (2003) is the fourth volume of his monumental history of German society. None of the series has yet been translated into English. A partial summary appears in Hans-Ulrich Wehler, ''The German Empire, 1871-1918'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

The historiographical concept of a German Sonderweg has had a turbulent history. Scholars of the 19th century who emphasised a separate German path to modernity saw it as a positive factor that differentiated Germany from the "western path" typified by Great Britain. The stressed the strong bureaucratic state, reforms initiated by Bismarck and other strong leaders, the Prussian service ethos, the high culture of philosophy and music, and Germany's pioneering of a [[Welfare state|social welfare state]].  In the 1950s, historians in  West Germany argued that the Sonderweg led Germany to the disaster of 1933-1945. The special circumstances of German historical structures and experiences, were interpreted as preconditions that, while not directly causing National Socialism, did hamper the development of a liberal democracy and facilitate the rise of fascism. The Sonderweg paradigm has provided the impetus for at least three strands of research in [[German historiography]]: the [[long 19th century]], the history of the bourgeoisie, and comparisons with the West.  After 1990, increased attention to cultural dimensions and to comparative and relational history moved German historiography to different topics, with much less attention paid to the Sonderweg.  While some historians have abandoned the Sonderweg thesis, they have not provided a generally accepted alternative interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Walser Smith,  "When the Sonderweg Debate Left Us ," ''German Studies Review,''on May 2008, Vol. 31#2  pp 225-240&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th-century France===
In his seminal book ''Peasants Into Frenchmen: The Modernisation of Rural [[France]], 1880–1914'' (1976), historian [[Eugen Weber]] traced the modernisation of French villages and argued that rural France went from backward and isolated to modern and possessing a sense of French nationhood during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Amato, "Eugen Weber's France" ''Journal of Social History,'' Volume 25, 1992 pp 879–882.&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasised the roles of railroads, republican schools, and universal military conscription. He based his findings on school records, migration patterns, military service documents and economic trends. Weber argued that until 1900 or so a sense of French nationhood was weak in the provinces. Weber then looked at how the policies of the Third Republic created a sense of French nationality in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Weber, "The Second Republic, Politics, and the Peasant," ''French Historical Studies'' Vol. 11, No. 4 (Autumn, 1980), pp. 521-550 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/286349 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was widely praised, but was criticised by some&lt;ref&gt;Ted W. Margadant, "French Rural Society in the Nineteenth Century: A Review Essay," ''Agricultural History,'' Summer 1979, Vol. 53 Issue 3, pp 644-651&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that a sense of Frenchness existed in the provinces before 1870.

====Greece====
The modernising force of the post-civil war Greek society came primarily as a result of the European and US geopolitical strategy for the region of eastern Mediterranean. Greece ought to be a modern capitalistic state to counter the proximity of several eastern and third world bloc countries and the strong [[Communist Party of Greece|national communist movement]]. According to [[Truman doctrine]] and with the support of local elites, a great economical  leap forward took place along with the severe repression that led to the 1967 coup d'état.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore A. Couloumbis, Greece in the Twentieth Century&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kostis Moskof, Isagogika shri istovia ton kinimatos tis evgatis taxis&lt;/ref&gt;
This dramatic change covered the long-standing cultural divide of greek academia, comparing modern and [[neo-greek]] to ancient and traditional identities. Music, art and [[cinema of greece|cinema]], influenced by the pioneers of American and European tendencies thrived,&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Papadimitriou and Yannis Tzioumakis, Greek Cinema&lt;/ref&gt; until the milestone of 1967, in contrast to the [[authoritarian]] and  [[tradition]]alist military and paramilitary structures. This dimension is vital as it reveals the process of modernisation under the western directives in all social levels that came in fact in opposition to the political directives of the same source.&lt;ref&gt;A. Papachelas, The rape of greek democracy: The American Factor, 1947-1967&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
Many studies of modernisation have focused on the [[history of Japan]] in the [[Meiji period|late 19th]] century,&lt;ref&gt;Shuzo Teruoka, ed. ''Agriculture in the Modernization of Japan, 1850-2000'' (2008); Cyril Black, ''The Modernization of Japan and Russia'' (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[China]] and [[India]] in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Russell H. Jeffries, ''China's Agricultural Modernization'' (2009); June Grasso, Jay Cornin, and Michael Kort, ''Modernization and Revolution in China: From the Opium Wars to the Olympics'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the process of borrowing science and technology from the West has been explored.

====China====
Modernisation theory failed to explain the experience of China. Mao modernised the People's Republic of China with massive industrialisation projects and social transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eberstadt|first=Nick|title=Did Mao Fail?|journal=The Wilson Quarterly|year=1980|volume=4|series=4|pages=120–133|jstor=40256004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, China did not become a democratic country after its modernisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hu|first=Shaohua|title=Balancing Development and Democracy: DENG'S ROLE IN THE CHINESE DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS|journal=World Affairs|year=1998|volume=161|series=2|pages=69–81|jstor=20672544}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Nowadays, even though the Soviet-style authoritarian regimes have already collapsed worldwide, China did not have any major political reforms after Mao's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garver|first=John W.|title=The Chinese Communist Party and the Collapse of Soviet Communism|journal=The China Quarterly|year=1993|pages=1–26|jstor=654237}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country remained authoritarian, despite the size of its economic sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=He|first=Baogang|author2=Mark E. Warren|title=Authoritarian Deliberation: The Deliberative Turn in Chinese Political Development|journal=Perspectives on Politics|year=2011|volume=9|issue=2|series=2|pages=269–289|jstor=41479652|doi=10.1017/s1537592711000892|citeseerx=10.1.1.724.6483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China has been attempting to modernise ever since the [[Xinhai Revolution|Revolution of 1911]] and the end of the [[Qing Dynasty]], the last dynasty of China. Before the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, it attempted to reform from 1902 to 1908 to save itself and instigated reforms in infrastructure, transportation, and government. These reforms were based on Western models and even included aspects of democracy, which are often associated with the process of modernisation. However, these reforms were largely unsuccessful and resulted in the Revolution of 1911. Following the Revolution of 1911, other movements such as the [[May 4th Movement]] of 1919 advocated for modernisation, [[iconoclasm]], and a rejection of foreign influence and [[imperialism]]. From the beginning of the 20th century until the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, China has been delayed in efforts to modernise due to an era of warlordism, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], and civil war between the [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]] and [[KMT]].&lt;ref name="Prentice Hall"&gt;{{cite book|title=Revolution and Its Past: Identities and Change in Modern China|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|edition=Third|editor=R. Keith Schoppa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardels 2011 61–64"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gardels|first=Nathan|title=The West No Longer Owns Modernity|journal=New Perspect|year=2011|volume=28|issue=3|pages=61–64|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5842.2011.01271.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the communist party came to power in 1949, [[Mao Zedong]] used the Soviet Union as China’s example for modernisation. [[The Great Leap Forward]] from 1958-1961 was Mao’s version of the Soviet Union’s [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five year Plan]], and its goals were to create a modern communist society through industrialisation and collectivisation. Mao Zedong aimed to become a world power without foreign, mainly western, involvement, ideas, or capitalism and preached the idea of self-reliance. Mao did contribute to the modernisation of China, however The Great Leap Forward is regarded as a failure and the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 to 1976 was detrimental to China's industrialisation progress.&lt;ref name="Prentice Hall"/&gt; [[File:Shanghai-pudong panorama.jpg|thumb|The Modern Chinese City of [[Shanghai]]]] However, during Mao's era, he transformed China from a predominantly agrarian country to an industrialised power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia|title=Modern East Asia from 1600, A Cultural, Social, and Political History|year=2013|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-133-60647-5|pages=476–489}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, China was able to produce most of commodities and goods by its own industry. Mao laid the foundation for China's economic development in Deng's era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tsui |first1=Anne S. |last2=Schoonhoven |first2=Claudia Bird |last3=Meyer |first3=Marshall W. |last4=Lau |first4=Chung-Ming |last5=Milkovich |first5=George T. |title=Organization and Management in the Midst of Societal Transformation: The People's Republic of China |journal=Organization Science |year=2004 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=133–144 |jstor=30034719 |doi=10.1287/orsc.1040.0063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic reforms of Chinese Supreme Leader [[Deng Xiaoping]] are attributed to China’s economic success in the 21st century. Deng focused on four modernisations: agriculture, industry, national defense, and science and technology. The West was used as an example for several of these modernisations, however their management was completely Chinese. Deng began de-collectivisation and allowed [[Township and Village Enterprise]]s (TVE), [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZ), foreign investment, profit incentive, and even privatisation.

While Mao advocated self-reliance, Deng generated foreign exchange to finance modernisation. His famous quote is, "It doesn’t matter whether a cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice." Post Deng Reforms continued on this path, which is acknowledged as a shift from the [[iron rice bowl]] to the porcelain rice bowl, or government owned to privatised. Although China’s economy has shifted towards privatisation and capitalism, the PRC remains an authoritative regime, which is contradictory in comparison to other examples of countries that have modernised. Democracy is the political characteristic that has defined modernised nations in the past and the modernisation theory suggests democracy follows with the development of a modernised state.&lt;ref name="Gardels 2011 61–64"/&gt; China was late in modernisation and has thus had many other countries as examples to base its model of modernisation off of.&lt;ref name="Prentice Hall"/&gt;

The [[One-Child Policy]] has also been a technique to contribute or even force the modernisation of China. Instigated in 1978, the one-child policy has created a generation known as "singletons" or "little emperors" (''xiao huangdi'').&lt;ref name="Little Emperors"&gt;{{cite book|title=Feeding China's Little Emperors:Food Children and Social Change|year=2000|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|editor=Jun Jing}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Chinese state enforced a rapid fertility transition designed to cultivate a generation of "high-quality" people with resources and ambition to join the global elite."&lt;ref name="One-Child Policy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fong|first=Vanessa|title=Only Hope: Coming of Age under China's One-Child Policy|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|page=17|isbn=978-0804753302}}&lt;/ref&gt; These little emperors are expected to compete with the first-world countries having no siblings to compete with for parental investment. Normally with modernisation and urbanisation smaller or [[nuclear family|nuclear families]] evolve as the result. China has switched this logic, hoping that creating the culture of the nuclear family with the one-child policy it will produce modernisation.&lt;ref name="One-Child Policy"/&gt;

At the beginning of the 21st century, China is still in the process of modernisation. In 2010 it had the third greatest GDP and GDP (PPP) in the world with the world’s largest labour force, and is acknowledged as the world’s second largest economy.&lt;ref name="Gardels 2011 61–64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CIA World Fact Book"&gt;{{cite web|title=CIA|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html|work=East and Southeast Asia: China|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010 its economy was still increasing in growth at 10.3%.&lt;ref name="CIA World Fact Book"/&gt; China has also successfully joined the largely Western international arena with its membership of the [[United Nations|UN]] in 1971, the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] in 2001, and hosted the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in 2008. China’s goal is to continue modernising until it joins the first-world and becomes the core instead of the semi-periphery or periphery, from the [[core-periphery| core-periphery model]].&lt;ref name="Prentice Hall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="One-Child Policy"/&gt;

The modernisation of China through urbanisation, industrialisation, and economic policy has benefited the country economically as it rises as a world power in the 21st century. However it now is experiencing the problems associated the other modern countries and capitalism. These problems include the growing disparity between the rich and poor, urban vs. rural and migration, and ecological issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowntree|first=Lester|title=Diversity Amid Globalization: World Regions, Environment, Development|year=2008|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-0-13-600554-4|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Korea====
Modernisers in [[South Korea]] in the late 19th century were torn between the American and the Japanese models. Most of the Koreans involved were educated Christians who saw America as their ideal model of civilisation. However, most used Japan as a practical model - as an example of how a fellow East Asian country, which 30 years before was also backward, could succeed in modernising itself. At the same time, reformists' nationalist reaction against the domineering, colonial behaviour of the Japanese in Korea often took the form of an appeal to international (Western) standards of civilisation. The Western-oriented worldview of the early Christian nationalist reformers was complex, multilayered, and often self-contradictory - with 'oppressive' features not easily distinguishable from 'liberational' ones. Their idealised image of the West as the only true, ideal civilisation relegated much of Korea's traditional culture to a position of 'oriental'.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Tikhonov, "The 1890s Korean Reformers' View of Japan - a Menacing Model?" ''International Journal of Asian Studies'' 2005 2(1): 57-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The self-image of Koreans was formed through complex relationships with modernity, colonialism, Christianity, and nationalism. This formation was initiated by a change in the notion of 'civilisation' due to the transformation of 'international society' and thereafter was affected by the trauma of Japanese colonisation. Through the process of transition from a traditional Confucian notion of civilisation to a Western notion of acceptance and resistance, Koreans shaped their civilisation as well as their notions of the racial, cultural, and individual modern self. Western Orientalism, in particular, accompanied the introduction of the Western notion of civilisation, which served as the background for forming the self-identity of Koreans. The fact that the Japanese version of [[Orientalism]] emerged from the domination of Korea by Japan played a critical role in shaping the self-identity of Koreans. Consequently, Korea still maintains an inferiority complex toward Western culture, ambivalent feelings toward Japanese culture, and biased - positive or negative - views of their own cultural traditions. Thus both modernisation and colonisation have shaped the formation or distortion of self-consciousness of non-Western peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Yong-hwa Chung, "The Modern Transformation of Korean Identity: Enlightenment and Orientalism," ''Korea Journal'' 2006 46(1): 109-138&lt;/ref&gt;

The US launched a decades-long intensive development starting in 1945 to modernise South Korea, with the goal of helping it become a model nation-state and an economic success. Agents of modernisation at work in Korea included the US Army, the Economic Cooperation Administration, the UN Korean Reconstruction Agency, and a number of nongovernmental organisations, among them the Presbyterian Church, the [[YMCA]], Boy Scouts and the [[Ford Foundation]].   Many Koreans migrated to California and Hawaii, and brought back firsthand accounts of modern business and governmental practices that they sought to adapt to Korean conditions.&lt;ref&gt;David Ekbladh, "How to Build a Nation," ''Wilson Quarterly'' 2004 28(1): 12-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
Modernisation theory was not compatible with Japan's experience. After industrialisation and economic modernisation, a democratic society did not appear in Japan. Japan instead became an aggressive authoritarian fascist state, up until the Allied Forces defeated Japan in the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berry|first=Mary Elizabeth|title=Public Life in Authoritarian Japan|journal=Daedalus|year=1998|volume=127|series=3|pages=133–165|jstor=20027510}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were almost no democratic principles or practices in pre-war Japanese politics. Prior to the liberation of Japan by the United States from its military government, Japanese culture always honoured obedience and hierarchy, and Japanese people also despised individualism and liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berger|first=Thomas U.|title=From Sword to Chrysanthemum: Japan's Culture of Anti-militarism|journal=International Security|year=1993|volume=17|issue=4|series=4|pages=119–150|jstor=2539024|doi=10.2307/2539024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan had already modernised and became an industrialised country during its Meiji period, which happened long before Japan's defeat in the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=La Follette|first=Philip F. |author2=Edward M. Coffman |author3=Paul H. Hass|title=With MacArthur in the Pacific: A Memoir by Philip F. La Follette|journal=The Wisconsin Magazine of History|date=1980–1981|volume=64|series=2|pages=82–106|jstor=4635497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan was probably the first country in East Asia that industrialised successfully. It quickly became one of the imperialist and colonial powers. Japan defeated the Qing dynasty of China in 1894, and subsequently defeated Russia in 1905. Korea and Taiwan were annexed by the Japanese Empire later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Samuels|first=Richard J.|title=Reinventing Security: Japan since Meiji|journal=Daedalus|year=1991|volume=120|series=4|pages=47–68|jstor=20025403}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Japan invaded China in 1931, it had already finished its industrialising process and had enough industrial power to wage a war itself. Japan's navy was among one of the world's most advanced navies, with almost no challenger in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yamamura|first=Kozo|title=Success Illgotten? The Role of Meiji Militarism in Japan's Technological Progress|journal=The Journal of Economic History|year=1977|volume=37|series=1|pages=113–135|jstor=2119450|doi=10.1017/s0022050700096777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance of Japan after the Second War was simply a result of the military supremacy of the United States. The United States absolutely ruled over Japan after its defeat, with General MacArthur as the de facto emperor of Japan at the time. Japan had no choice but listen to the orders of General MacArthur and his colleagues. In order to be compatible with the foreign policy and national interest of the United States, SCAP and General MacArthur forced Japan to demilitarise and democratise after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kitahara|first=Michio|title=Douglas MacArthur as a Father Figure in Occupied Japan After World War II|journal=International Social Science  Review|year=1989|volume=64|series=1|pages=20–28|jstor=41881853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan quickly went through a lot of changes concerning modernisation after their defeat. This happened starting with United States quickly intervening with Japan internally. American demilitarisation and democratisation was accepted by the people of Japan without strong resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia|title=Modern East Asia from 1600, A Cultural, Social, and Political History|year=2013|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-133-60647-5|pages=461–464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the occupation of United States, SCAP ([[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]]) was established, which was an institution in charge of formulating policies. The goal of SCAP was to dissolve the army and navy, and also to punish responsible leaders, and it established the New constitution of 1946.&lt;ref name="Modern Japan"&gt;{{cite book|title=A history of Modern Japan|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCAP could not function without the assistance of Japanese government because the language barrier was too high. However, this actually helped make bigger changes in creating demilitarisation and democratisation.  SCAP helped people to gain freedoms of speech, press and the right to organise labour or farmer unions.

As such, the new constitution created by SCAP granted civil and political rights to the people; consequently, leading to modernisation. It also allowed freedom of speech and association, right to organise labour association and movements, or create unions, and implemented grounds for incredible civil right for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia|title=Modern East Asia from 1600, A Cultural, Social, and Political History|year=2013|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-133-60647-5|pages=460–468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government also held an important role in modernising Japan. Japan concentrated on their industry and technology to achieve growth. For that, the state gave assistances to several industries and adopted protectionism policies. Government stepped in as lender, as facilitator of access to foreign exchange, raw materials, or technology licenses, and as rescuer when problems arise.&lt;ref name="Modern Japan"&gt;{{cite book|title=A history of Modern Japan|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate, the most important guiding agency was the [[MITI]] (Ministry of International Trade and Industry). In addition, through the 1960s, Japanese government used economic policies such as tariffs to obstruct imports and protect Japanese firms from foreign competitors in domestic market to become a modernised country.

====Turkey====
[[Turkey]], under [[Kemal Atatürk]] in the 1920s and 1930s, engaged in a systematic modernisation programme [[Atatürk's Reforms|called "Kemalism"]]. Hundreds of European scholars came to help. Together with Turkish intellectuals they developed a successful model of development.&lt;ref&gt;Craig C. Hansen, "Are We Doing Theory Ethnocentrically? A Comparison of Modernization Theory and Kemalism," ''Journal of Developing Societies'' (0169796X), 1989, Vol. 5 Issue 2, pp 175-187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murat Ergin, "Cultural encounters in the social sciences and humanities: western émigré scholars in Turkey," ''History of the Human Sciences,'' Feb 2009, Vol. 22 Issue 1, pp 105-130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Reisman, ''Turkey's Modernization: Refugees from Nazism and Atatürk's Vision'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ward and Dankwart Rustow, eds. ''Political Modernization in Japan and Turkey'' (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
Since independence, modernisation has been a driving force for [[Chile]]'s political elites. Ree (2007) analyses projects of modernisation that have been implemented from above since 1964. Despite their ideological differences and very different understandings of what modernity is, these projects shared key characteristics in their construction and implementation, such as the use of developmental theories, their state-orientation, the prominent role of technocrats and state-planning, and the capacity of adaptation in sight of civil unrest. These projects have produced patterns of modernity that have proven particularly stable.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Van Der Ree, "Modernisation in Chile: from the 'Revolution in Liberty' to 'Growth with Equity'," ''Bicentenario: Revista De Historia De Chile Y America'' 2007 6(2): 39-69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
Modernisation has been attributed with creating positive development around the world, but in Modern times its ability to promote development, specifically in [[Africa]], has been less than so.  Modernisation that has taken place in Africa can be described as something that has yet to benefit most of the African countries.

Modernisation through development has led to problems in [[Nigeria]] by bringing in private, foreign owned oil companies that have been exploiting the natural resource wealth of the country.  Because the oil companies are generally owned by a different nation, the profits are mostly being exported from Nigeria with only one fifteenth of the wealth produced in the region returning to it.  Shell, the oil company operating in Ogoniland, Nigeria has helped the country develop and industrialise on a small scale, but it has primarily challenged the sovereignty and autonomy of Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogowski|first=edited by Patrick O'Neil, Ronald|title=Essential readings in comparative politics|year=2010|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-93401-4|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lot of scholars view modernisation as a sort of westernisation where western institutions such as national parks and industries are brought into existing cultures where their use does not make as much sense.  Along with modernisation comes a loss of culture and society, and the individual is strengthened. An African tribe known as the Ik was forced to change their habits due to modernisation and the creation of individual countries caused by colonialism. Nationalisation, as a tool of modernisation, was imparted on Africa by colonialists who wanted to westernise and modernise tribal Africa.  The creation of individual countries made life for the tribal Ik more difficult because they were forced out of their nomadic lifestyle into a settlement based around a newly founded national park that practically destroyed their livelihood by restricting their hunting grounds to specific non-park areas.  The creation of national parks have increased cultivation, which can be seen as good development because people no longer depend solely  on livestock.  This creation of a new sort of livelihood has mixed improvements, because the tribal setting is not removed, but is put into a single place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turbull|first=Colin M.|title=The Mountain People|year=1972|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dilemma of Balaki==

Proud Balaki skilled in expounding, eloquent, went to Ajatsatru, the King of [[Benares]], to impart superior wisdom to him which he knew only as the conditioned [[Brahman]]; he knew about the physical and physiological categories and therefore, the king soon realized that Balaki did not know about Brahman. Balaki was not aware of the fact that whatever he knew was the result of [[Avidya (Hinduism)|ignorance]], that the results of ignorance, being finite things, are separated from him. Ajatsatru then tells Balaki Gargya that reality is to be found in the deep-sleep-consciousness. [[Pippalada]], the sage of the [[Prashna Upanishad]], holds that sleep is caused by the senses being absorbed in that highest 'sensorium' the mind, which is why in deep sleep man is not able to hear, not to see, nor to smell because the mind is then merged into an ocean of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy 1986 Ed.|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan|page=33,89,185|url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/constructive-survey-of-upanishadic-philosophy-being-an-introduction-to-the-thought-of-the-upanishads/oclc/799119712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrine of deep-sleep-consciousness==

[[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] explains that Balaki knew only about those phases of Brahman that consist of name, form and action which have to be known in the sphere of [[Avidya (Hinduism)|ignorance]]. Therefore, in the context of deep-sleep-consciousness, Ajatsatru reiterates that the being full of consciousness in sleep absorbs the functions of the organs through its own consciousness and lies in [[Akasha]] that is in the heart. The heart is the seat of the intellect, the internal organ, and the other or external organs are subject to that intellect abiding in the heart. What is seen in a dream are not the attributes of the self. That conscious being, who has identified itself with action, its factors and its results due to the limitations of name and form and is superimposed by ignorance, virtually comes back to the body in the manner described in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]:-

:अथ यदा सुषुप्तो भवति, यदा न कस्यचन वेद, हिता नाडयो द्वासप्ततिः सहस्त्राणि ह्र्द्यत्पुरिततमभिप्रतिष्ठन्ते, 
:ताभिः प्रत्यवसृप्य पुरीतति शेते; स यथा कुमारो वा महाराजो वा महाब्राह्मणो वाति ध्नीमानन्दस्य गत्वा शयीत, एवमेवैष एतच्छेते ||२.१.१९||

:"Again when it becomes fast asleep – when it does not know anything – it comes back along the seventy-two thousand nerves called ''Hitā'', which extend from the heart to the pericardium (the whole body), and remains in the body. As a baby, or an emperor, or a noble Brahmana lives, having attained the acme of bliss, so does it remain." – ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] II.i.19)

:…अस्यैता हिता नाम नाडयोऽन्तर्ह्रदये प्रतिष्ठिता भवन्ति, एताभिर्वा एतदास्त्रवतिः तस्मादेष प्रविविक्ताहारतर इवैव भवत्यस्माच्छारिरादत्मनः ||४.२.३||

:".. In this body there are nerves called ''Hitā'', which are placed in the heart. Through these the essence of our food passes at it moves on. Therefore the subtle body has finer food than the gross body." – ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] II.i.19)

:ता व अस्यैता हिता नाम नाडयो यथा केशः सहस्त्रधा भिन्नस्तावताणिम्ना तिष्ठन्ति, शुक्लस्य नीलस्य पिङ्गलस्य हरितस्य लोहितस्य पूर्णा;....||४.३.२०||

:"In him are those nerves called ''Hitā'', which are as fine as a hair split into a thousand parts, and filled with white, blue, brown, green and red (serums). (They are the seat of the subtle body in which impressions are stored)…" – ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] II.i.19)

The experience of the waking state is seen in dreams. The [[Taijasa]] is nourished by finer food than the [[Vaisvanara]]. And, ignorance is not the natural characteristic of the self. All impressions due to the experience of high and low attributes of the relative universe are centred in the subtle body where they are stored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|page=198,412,457|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad-madhavananda/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication==

[[Swami Nikhilananda]] explains that the self that functions in the 'waking state' is [[Vaisvanara]], which in the 'dream state' is [[Taijasa]] and in the 'dreamless-sleep state', ''Prajna''; [[Viraj]] (matter) unites with this self identified with [[Indra]] in dreams when there is no distinction between the experiencer and the object of experience. In deep sleep the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], limited by ''[[Prana]] '' or vital breath, is called ''[[Prajna (Vedic)|Prajna]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Principal Upanishads|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|page=225|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BQxXk7pAx0cC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=hita+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VH8aU7rFM4eYrAfi3oCwCw&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hita%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subtle body in which the impressions that are stored in the body owing to the contact with the serums filled in the ''Hitā'' undergoes modifications under the influence of past merit and demerit, and in dreams falsely manifests itself as impressions in a variety of forms. When ignorance is eliminated and knowledge reaches its perfection, the state of identity with all ('[[Moksha|liberation]]') is attained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=457–459|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad-madhavananda/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Wesler-Lang, in his article Déconstruire le masculin, problèmes épistémologiques, situates Reynauds thoughts within studies of masculinity and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnam.fr/psychanalyse/recherche/revue/textewelzer3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128135202/http://www.cnam.fr/psychanalyse/recherche/revue/textewelzer3.pdf |archivedate=2006-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Background on Holy Virility'''

Holy Virility observes the different aspects of male power that is perpetrated on women. The book The Social Construction of Masculinity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://keimena11.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/emmanuel-reynaud-holy-virility-the-social-construction-of-masculinity-1981.pdf|title = Holy Virility|date = 12/10/15|accessdate = 12/10/15|website = Holy Virility by Emmanuel Reynaud|publisher = |last = Reynaud|first = Emmanuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains how Holy Virility and males are oppressed to measure up to the standards of being an identified male. The author Emmanuel Renaud argues that “It is within men’s grasp to reject power relations and begin to behave in a way that is neither hierarchical nor exploitative.” The author explores different dynamics and is active in finding knowledge to educate men and women.  The books main focus is on men’s biological makeup, sexuality, phallic orgasm, language, being a dad/rapist and being married. Emmanuel Reynaud explores and explains how men’s performance in society are supposed to be masculine. Emmanuel Reynaud born in France influences and educates the men’s movement in France. Today some of the concepts used in the book are seen in today’s society. Western and Eastern ideologies of being a man and women are different throughout history. Men abuse the power they have and seem hierarchal against women. Holy Virility is the social construction of masculinity. Men today are taught to act a certain way through gender, men for masculinity and female through acting feminine. Although, men and women can put on a performance of opposite genders. The Holy Virility explains the reasons why do men act the way they do and give concrete information about men's performance.

'''Homage''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɒ|m|ᵻ|dʒ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|m|ᵻ|dʒ}}) is a show or demonstration of [[respect]] or [[dedication]] to someone or something, sometimes by simple declaration but often by some more oblique reference, artistic or poetic.  The term is often used in the arts for where one author or artist shows respect to another by allusion or imitation; this is often pronounced like the French ''hommage'' ({{IPAc-en|əʊ|ˈ|m|ɑː|ʒ}}).&lt;ref name="onlanguage"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/magazine/07FOB-onlanguage-t.html?_r=1&amp;ref=onlanguage|title=Homage|first=Ben |last=Zimmer |at=On Language | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |date=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
It was originally a [[Homage (feudal)|declaration of fealty]] in the [[feudal system]]—swearing that one was the{{Dubious|date=February 2015|reason= "a" rather than "the" is common sense, since many men owed homage to any lord worthy of the title.

Provide page and wording that justifies "the [man of]"}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept then became used figuratively for an acknowledgement of quality or superiority.  For example, a man might give homage to a lady, so honouring her beauty and other graces.  In German scholarship, followers of a great scholar developed the custom of honouring their mentor by producing papers for a ''[[festschrift]]'' dedicated to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ESFS7XXhujAC&amp;pg=PA75 |title=An author's guide to scholarly publishing |author=Robin M. Derricourt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In music homage can take the form of a composition (''[[Homage to Paderewski]]''), a [[tribute album]] (''[[Homage to Charles Parker]]'') or a [[sampling (music)|sample]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tz5YpijuksC&amp;pg=PA616 |title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World |author=John Shepherd |chapter=Rock Homage}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of | 2010}}, the digital techniques used to generate many forms of media make it easy to borrow from other works and this [[Mediation (Marxist theory and media studies)#Remediation|remediation]] may be used in homage to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWNnBndF9uEC&amp;pg=PA497 |title=Routledge encyclopedia of narrative theory |author=Richard Grusin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identity performance is a concept that holds that "[[Identity (social science)|identity]]" can be a project or a conscious effort or action taken to present oneself in social interactions. This is based on the definition of identity as an ongoing process of self-definition and the definitions of the self by others, which emerge out of interaction with others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Multi - Girl - Culture: An Ethnography of Doing Identity|last=Duits|first=Linda|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|year=2008|isbn=9789056295257|location=Amsterdam|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that there are identities that are performed to achieve several objectives such as assimilation and acculturation, among others. It draws from the [[Erving Goffman]]'s theatrical metaphor theory where, in social situations, the others perform the role of the audience, which an individual must perform to impress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Concept ==
In everyday [[interaction]]s, the [[Human body|body]] serves as a critical site of identity performance. In conveying who we are to other people, we use our bodies to project information about ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Fred. 1992. Fashion, Culture and Identity. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This is done through movement, clothes, speech, and [[facial expression]]s. What we put forward is our best effort at what we want to say about who we are. Yet while we intend to convey one impression, our performance is not always interpreted as we might expect. Through learning to make sense of others’ responses to our behavior, we can assess how well we have conveyed what we intended. We can then alter our performance accordingly. This process of performance, interpretation, and adjustment is what Goffman calls [[impression management]].&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Erving. 1956. The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. Edinburgh: University of Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; Impression management is a part of a larger process where people seek to define a situation&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Erving. 1963. Behavior in Public Places. New York: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; through their behavior. People seek to define [[social situation]]s by using contextual cues from the environment around them. [[Social norm]]s emerge from situational definitions, as people learn to read cues from the environment and the people present to understand what is appropriate behavior.

Learning how to manage impressions is a critical [[social skill]] that is honed through experience. Over time, we learn how to make meaning out of a situation, others’ reactions, and what we are projecting of ourselves. As children, we learn that actions on our part prompt reactions by adults; as we grow older, we learn to interpret these reactions and adjust our behavior. Diverse [[social environment]]s help people develop these skills because they force individuals to re-evaluate the signals they take for granted.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Danah. 2008 “Why Youth (Heart) Social Network Sites: The Role of Networked Publics in Teenage Social Life.” MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Learning, Identity Volume (ed. David Buckingham).&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of learning to read [[social cues]] and react accordingly is core to being socialized into a society. While the process itself begins at home for young children, it is critical for young people to engage in broader social settings to develop these skills. Of course, how children are taught about situations and impression management varies greatly by culture,&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Jean. 1999. Inuit Morality Play: The Emotional Education of a Three-Year-Old. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; but these processes are regularly seen as part of coming of age. While no one is ever a true master of impression management, the [[teenage]] years are ripe with experiences to develop these skills.

In [[mediated environment]]s, bodies are not immediately visible and the skills people need to interpret situations and manage impressions are different. As Jenny Sundén argues, people must learn to write themselves into being.&lt;ref&gt;Sundén, Jenny. 2003. Material Virtualities. New York: Peter Lang Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Doing so makes visible how much we take the body for granted. While text, images, audio, and video all provide valuable means for developing a [[virtual presence]], the act of articulation differs from how we convey meaningful information through our bodies. This process also makes explicit the [[self-reflexivity]] that Giddens argues is necessary for [[identity formation]], but the choices individuals make in crafting a [[digital body]] highlight the self-monitoring that Foucault so sinisterly notes.&lt;ref&gt;See David Buckingham’s introduction to this volume for a greater discussion of this.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some sense, people have more control online – they are able to carefully choose what information to put forward, thereby eliminating visceral reactions that might have seeped out in everyday [[communication]]. At the same time, these digital bodies are fundamentally coarser, making it far easier to misinterpret what someone is expressing. Furthermore, as [[Amy Bruckman]] shows, key information about a person’s body is often present online, even when that person is trying to act deceptively; for example, people are relatively good at detecting when someone is a man even when they profess to be a woman online.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Joshua and Amy Bruckman. 2001. "The Turing Game: Exploring Identity in an Online Environment." Convergence, 7(3), 83-102.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet because mediated environments present reveal different signals, the mechanisms of [[deception]] differ.&lt;ref&gt;Donath, Judith. 1999. “Identity and deception in the virtual community.” Communities in Cyberspace (Marc Smith &amp; Peter Kollock, eds). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
There are studies that reveal specific cases of identity performance. These include the investigation on the experiences of Latino students in the American public education system. It was found that within culturally coded classrooms, members of this ethnic group have to perform identity in the form of behavioral signal that they are as worthy of achievement as their white peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carillo|first=Andres|date=2008-2009|title=The Costs of Success: Mexican American Identity Performance within Culturally Coded Classrooms and Educational Achievement|url=|journal=Review of Law and Social Justice|volume=18: 3|pages=641-676|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also underscored that the white identity serves as the standard and that the performances often emulated it so that they form part of the how individuals from different ethnic groups assimilate. The "public performances" enacted by black females such as the assumption of the role of the "black vixen" are also cases in point. Researchers cite that roles are performed to reenact, reimagine and even revise personal and collective history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speaking in Tongues and Dancing Diaspora: Black Women Writing and Performing|last=Henderson|first=Mae|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=9780195116595|location=Oxford|pages=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interactive media''' normally refers to products and services on digital computer-based systems which respond to the user's actions by presenting content such as [[text (literary theory) | text]], [[moving image]], [[animation]], [[video]], [[Digital audio | audio]], and [[video games]].

==Definition==
[[Interactivity|Interactive]] media is a method of communication in which the output from the media comes from the input of the users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interactive media|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interactive-media.asp|website=Investopedia|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"When Smart Devices Interact With Pervasive Screens: A Survey", 
P.C. Ng, K.E. Eun, J. She, M. Baldauf, ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM) 
Volume 13, Issue 4, August 2017.
[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3115933]&lt;/ref&gt;
Interactive media works with the user's participation. The media still has the same purpose but the user's input adds interaction and brings interesting features to the system for better enjoyment.

==Development==
The analogue videodisc developed by NV [[Philips]] was the pioneering technology for interactive media. Additionally, there are several elements that encouraged the development of interactive media including the following: 
* The laser disc technology was first invented in 1958. It enabled the user to access high-quality analogue images on the computer screen. This increased the ability of interactive video systems. 
* The concept of the [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), which was developed in the 1970s, popularized by [[Apple Computer, Inc.]] was essentially about visual metaphors, intuitive feel and sharing information on the virtual desktop. Additional power was the only thing needed to move into multimedia.
* The sharp fall in hardware costs and the unprecedented rise in the computer speed and memory transformed the personal computer into an affordable machine capable of combining audio and color video in advanced ways. 
* Another element is the release of [[Windows 3.0]] in 1990 by [[Microsoft]] into the mainstream IBM clone world. It accelerated the acceptance of GUI as the standard mechanism for communicating with small computer systems. 
* The development by NV [[Philips]] of optical digital technologies built around the compact disk (CD) in 1979 is also another leading element in the interactive media development as it raised the issue of developing interactive media.&lt;ref&gt;Lat chem, C., Williamson, J., &amp; Henderson-Lancet, L. (1993). Interactive multimedia practice and promise. London; Philadelphia: Koran page.&lt;/ref&gt; 
All of the prior elements contributed in the development of the main hardware and software systems used in interactive media.

==Terminology==
Though the word ''media'' is plural, the term  is often used as a singular noun.

Interactive media is related to the concepts [[interaction design]], [[new media]], [[interactivity]], [[human computer interaction]], [[cyberculture]], [[digital culture]], [[interactive design]], and includes [[augmented reality]].

An essential feature of interactivity is that it is mutual: user and machine each take an active role (see [[interaction]]). Most [[interactive computing]] systems are for some human purpose and interact with humans in human contexts.&lt;ref name="Dix"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Dix  | first1 = Alan  | last2 = Finlay  | first2 = Janet  | last3 = Abowd  | first3 = Gregory D.  | last4 = Beale  | first4 = Russell  | authorlink = Alan Dix  | title = Human-computer interaction. 3rd edn.  | publisher = Pearson Education  | year = 2004  | page = xvi  | isbn = 9780130461094}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manovich complains that 'In relation to computer-based media, the concept of interactivity is a tautology.  .... Therefore, to call computer media “interactive” is meaningless – it  simply means stating the most basic fact about computers.'.&lt;ref name="Manovich"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Manovich  | first = Lev  | authorlink = Lev Manovich  | title = The Language of New Media  | publisher = MIT Press  | location = Cambridge  | year = 2001  | page = 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the term is useful to denote an identifiable body of practices and technologies.

Interactive media are an instance of a computational method influenced by the sciences of cybernetics, [[autopoiesis]] and system theories, and challenging notions of reason and cognition, perception and memory, emotions and affection.

Any form of interface between the [[end user]]/[[audience]] and the medium may be considered interactive. Interactive media is not limited to [[electronic media]] or digital media. [[Board game]]s, [[pop-up book]]s, [[gamebook]]s, [[flip book]]s and [[constellation wheel]]s are all examples of printer interactive media. Books with a simple [[table of contents]] or [[Index (publishing)|index]] may be considered interactive due to the [[non-linear]] control mechanism in the medium, but are usually considered non-interactive since the majority of the [[user experience]] is non-interactive reading.&lt;ref&gt;[[Media psychology]] is the newest emerging dimension of media theory applied to interactive media. {{cite web |url=http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/sfischo/MEDIADEF-2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011010440/http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/sfischo/MEDIADEF-2.html |archivedate=2011-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

===Effects on learning===
Interactive media is helpful in the four development dimensions in which young children learn: social and emotional, language development, cognitive and general knowledge, and approaches toward learning. Using computers and educational computer software in a learning environment helps children increase communication skills and their attitudes about learning. Children who use educational computer software are often found using more complex speech patterns and higher levels of verbal communication. A study found that basic interactive books that simply read a story aloud and highlighted words and phrases as they were spoken were beneficial for children with lower reading abilities. Children have different styles of learning, and interactive media helps children with visual, verbal, auditory, and tactile learning styles.&lt;ref&gt;Glaucoma, Christina R., M.A. The Effects of Interactive Media on Preschoolers' Learning: A Review of the Research and Recommendations for the Future. P. 13-17. Ed. Eileen Espresso, Patti Miller, and Christine Cordoba.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intuitive understanding===
Interactive media makes technology more intuitive to use. Interactive products such as smartphones, iPad's/iPod's, interactive whiteboards and websites are all easy to use. The easy usage of these products encourages consumers to experiment with their products rather than reading instruction manuals.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Stuart. "The Disadvantages and Advantages of Interactive Media." EHow. Demand Media, 10 May 2011. Web. 23 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===
Interactive media promotes dialogic communication. This form of communication allows senders and receivers to build long term trust and cooperation. This plays a critical role in building relationships. Organizations also use interactive media to go further than basic marketing and develop more positive behavioral relationships.&lt;ref&gt;DeYeso, Jennifer. "The Effect of Interactive and Traditional Media on Relationship Building." Slideshare. LinkedIn Corporation, 25 Apr. 2012. Web. 23 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on families==
The introduction of interactive media has greatly affected the lives and inner workings of families, with many family activities having integrated with technology quite seamlessly, allowing both children and parents to adapt to it as they see fit. However, parents have also become increasingly worried about the impact that it will have on their family lives. This is not necessarily because they are opposed to technology, but because they fear that it will lessen the time that they get to spend with their children. Studies have shown that although interactive media is able to connect families together when they are unable to physically, the dependence on this media also continues to persist even when there are opportunities for family time, which often leads the adults to believe that it distracts children more than it benefits them.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Katie Headrick; Takeuchi, Lori; Stevens, Reed. "Mapping the daily media round: novel methods for understanding families' mobile technology use." Learning, Media, and Technology. 21 Oct. 2017. Accessed 4 Feb. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
===Distributed interactive media===
The media which allows several geographically remote users to interact synchronously with the media application/system is known as Distributed Interactive Media. Some common examples of this type of Media include Online Gaming, Distributed Virtual Environment, Whiteboards which are used for interactive conferences and many more.&lt;ref&gt;Mauve, Martin; Vogel, Jiirgen (2001) "Consistency Control for Distributed Interactive Media" Sept. 30-Oct. 5, 2001, Ottawa, Canada 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
A couple of basic examples of [https://www.interactivemedia.az/en/ interactive media] (also known as a company in Azerbaijan) are video games and websites. Websites, especially social networking websites provide the interactive use of text and graphics to its users, who interact with each other in various ways such as chatting, playing online games, sharing posts that may include their thoughts and/or pictures and so forth. Video games are also one of the common examples of Interactive Media as the players make use of the joystick/controller to interactively respond to the actions and changes taking place on the game screen generated by the game application, which in turn reacts to the response of the players through the joystick/controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interactive-media.asp|title=Interactive Media|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=28 September 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technologies and implementation==
Interactive media can be implemented using a variety of platforms and applications that use technology. Some examples include mobile platforms such as touch screen smartphones and tablets, as well as other interactive mediums that are created exclusively to solve a unique problem or set of problems. Interactive media is not limited to a professional environment, it can be used for any technology that responds to user actions. This can include the use of [[JavaScript]] and [[AJAX]] in web pages, but can also be used in programming languages or technology that has similar functionality.

One of the most recent innovations to use interactivity that solves a problem that individuals have on a daily basis is [[Delta Airlines]]'s "Photon Shower".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.cnn.com/delta-teases-us-shower-beats-jet-lag-473471/|title=Delta teases us with 'shower' that beats jet lag - CNN Travel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This device was developed as a collaboration between Delta Airlines and Professor [[Russell Foster]] of [[Cambridge University]]. The device is designed to reduce the effect of [[Jet lag|jet lag]] on customers that often take long flights across time zones. The interactivity is evident because of how it solves this problem. By observing what time zones a person has crossed and matching those to the basic known sleep cycles of the individual, the machine is able to predict when a person's body is expecting light, and when it is expecting darkness. It then stimulates the individual with the appropriate light source variations for the time, as well as an instructional card to inform them of what times their body expects light and what times it expects darkness. Growth of interactive media continues to advance today, with the advent of more and more powerful machines the limit to what can be input and manipulated on a display in real time is become virtually non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/file/positions/PS_technology_WEB2.pdf | title=Technology and Interactive Media as Tools in Early Childhood Programs Serving Children from Birth through Age 8|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324042025/http://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/file/positions/PS_technology_WEB2.pdf|archivedate=24 March 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031121333/https://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/PS_technology_Examples.pdf|url=https://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/PS_technology_Examples.pdf|title=Selected Examples of Effective Classroom Practice Involving Technology Tools and Interactive Media|archivedate=31 October 2012|publisher=|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exacttarget.com/blog/5-interactive-media-examples-of-the-new-mad-men/|title=Marketing|website=Salesforce.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations coordinated an '''International Conference on Population and Development''' (ICPD) in [[Cairo]], Egypt, on 5–13 September 1994. Its resulting Programme of Action is the steering document for the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA).

Some 20,000 delegates from various governments, UN agencies, NGOs, and the media gathered for a discussion of a variety of population issues, including immigration, [[infant mortality]], [[birth control]], [[family planning]], the [[female education|education of women]], and protection for women from unsafe abortion services.

The conference received considerable media attention due to disputes regarding the assertion of [[reproductive rights]]. The [[Holy See]] and several predominantly [[Islam]]ic nations were staunch critics, and U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] received considerable criticism from [[Conservatism|conservatives]] for his participation, considering the fact that president [[Ronald Reagan]] did not attend or fund the previous conference held in Mexico City in 1984. The official spokesman for the Holy See was archbishop [[Renato Martino]].

According to the official ICPD release, the conference delegates achieved consensus on the following four qualitative and quantitative goals:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unfpa.org/public/site/global/publications/pid/1973 "Report of the International Conference on Population and Development"], [[UNFPA]], 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Universal education''': Universal primary education in all countries by 2015. Urge countries to provide wider access to women for secondary and higher level education as well as vocational and technical training.
#'''Reduction of infant and [[child mortality]]''': Countries should strive to reduce infant and under-5 child mortality rates by one-third or to 50–70 deaths per 1000 by the year 2000. By 2015 all countries should aim to achieve a rate below 35 per 1,000 live births and under-five mortality rate below 45 per 1,000. 	
#'''Reduction of [[maternal mortality]]''': A reduction by {{sfrac|1|2}} the 1990 levels by 2000 and {{sfrac|1|2}} of that by 2015. Disparities in maternal mortality within countries and between geographical regions, socio-economic and ethnic groups should be narrowed. 	
#'''Access to reproductive and sexual health services including family planning''': Family-planning counseling, pre-natal care, safe delivery and post-natal care, prevention and appropriate treatment of infertility, prevention of abortion and the management of the consequences of abortion, treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases and other reproductive health conditions; and education, counseling, as appropriate, on human sexuality, reproductive health and responsible parenthood. Services regarding HIV/AIDS, breast cancer, infertility, and delivery should be made available. Active discouragement of [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM).

==ICPD and abortion==
During and after the ICPD, some interested parties attempted to interpret the term 'reproductive health' in the sense that it implies abortion as a means of family planning or, indeed, a right to abortion. These interpretations, however, do not reflect the consensus reached at the Conference. 
For the European Union, where legislation on abortion is less restrictive than elsewhere, the Council Presidency has clearly stated that the Council's commitment to promote 'reproductive health' did not include the promotion of abortion.&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament, 4 December 2003: Oral Question (H-0794/03) for Question Time at the part-session in December 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Dana Scallon to the Council. In the written record of that session, one reads: Posselt (PPE-DE): “Does the term 'reproductive health' include the promotion of abortion, yes or no?” – Antonione, Council: “No.”&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the European Commission, in response to a question from a Member of the European Parliament, clarified:

"The term 'reproductive health' was defined by the United Nations (UN) in 1994 at the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development. All Member States of the Union endorsed the Programme of Action adopted at Cairo. The Union has never adopted an alternative definition of 'reproductive health' to that given in the Programme of Action, '''which makes no reference to abortion'''."&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament, 24 October 2002: Question no 86 by Dana Scallon (H-0670/02)&lt;/ref&gt;
  
With regard to the US, only a few days prior to the Cairo Conference, the head of the US delegation, Vice President [[Al Gore]], had stated for the record:
 
"Let us get a false issue off the table: the US does not seek to establish a new international right to abortion, and we do not believe that abortion should be encouraged as a method of family planning."&lt;ref&gt;Jyoti Shankar Singh, Creating a New Consensus on Population (London: Earthscan, 1998), 60&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Some years later, the position of the US Administration in this debate was reconfirmed by US Ambassador to the UN, [[Ellen Sauerbrey]], when she stated at a meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of Women that: 
"nongovernmental organizations are attempting to assert that Beijing in some way creates or contributes to the creation of an internationally recognized fundamental right to abortion".&lt;ref&gt;Lederer, AP/San Francisco Chronicle, 1 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; She added: "There is no fundamental right to abortion. And yet it keeps coming up largely driven by NGOs trying to hijack the term and trying to make it into a definition".&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Reuters, 28 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5480">A '''lapsus''' ([[Latin]] for "lapse, slip, error") is an involuntary mistake made while writing or speaking, something long studied in [[philology]].&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Greetham, ''Scholarly Editing'' (1995)p. 452&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations==
In 1895 an investigation into verbal slips was undertaken by a philologist and a psychologist, [[Rudolf Meringer]] and [[Karl Meyer (psychologist)|Karl Meyer]], who collected a large number of examples and divided them into separate types.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychoanalysis===
Freud was to become interested in such mistakes from 1897 onwards, developing an interpretation of slips in terms of their unconscious meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for our Time'' (1989) p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently followers of his like [[Ernest Jones]] developed the theme of lapsus in connection with writing, typing, and misprints.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Greetham, ''Theories of the Text'' (1999) p. 249-252&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s early [[psychoanalytic theory]], a lapsus represents a bungled act that hides an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] desire: “the phenomena can be traced back to incompletely suppressed psychical material...pushed away by consciousness”.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, quoted in A. Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (1994) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan]] would thoroughly endorse the Freudian interpretation of unconscious motivation in the slip, arguing that “in the ''lapsus'' it is...clear that every unsuccessful act is a successful, not to say 'well-turned', discourse”.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (1997) p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventies [[Sebastiano Timpanaro]] would controversially take up the question again, by offering a mechanistic explanation of all such slips, in opposition to Freud's theories.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 755&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of lapsus==

In literature, a number of different types of lapsus are named depending on the mode of correspondence:&lt;ref&gt;Freud, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Speech error|lapsus linguae]]'' (pl. same): slip of the tongue 
* ''[[wikt:lapsus calami|lapsus calami]]'': slip of the pen&lt;ref&gt;B. A. Garner, ''Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage'' (1995) p. 499&lt;/ref&gt; With the variation of ''lapsus clavis'': slip of the typewriter
* ''[[wikt:lapsus manus|lapsus manus]]'': slip of the hand, similar to ''lapsus calami''
* ''[[wikt:lapsus memoriae|lapsus memoriae]]'': slip of memory

=== Types of slips of the tongue ===
Slips of the tongue can happen on any level:
*[[Syntaxis|Syntactic]] - ''is'' instead of ''was''.
*Phrasal slips of tongue - ''I'll explain this tornado later''. 
*Lexical/semantic - ''moon full'' instead of ''full moon''.
*[[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphological]] level - ''working'''s''' paper''
*Phonological (sound slips) - ''flow snurries'' instead of ''snow flurries''

Additionally, each of these five levels of error may take various forms:
*[[Anticipation]]s: Where an early output item is corrupted by an element belonging to a later one,&lt;ref&gt;Freud, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; thus "reading list" - "leading list"
*Perseverations or post-sonances: Where a later output item is corrupted by an element belonging to an earlier one&lt;ref&gt;Greetham, ''Theories'' p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Thus "waking rabbits" - "waking wabbits".
*Deletions: Where an output element is somehow totally lost, thus "same state" - "same sate"
*Shift: Moving a letter, thus "black foxes" - "back floxes"
*Haplologies&lt;ref&gt;This is a different phenomenon from that described in the main article on [[Haplology|haplologies]], which involves the removal of identical consecutive syllables.&lt;/ref&gt; or fusion: Half one word and half the other, thus "stummy" instead of "stomach or tummy"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, p. 58-9&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pun]]&lt;ref&gt;B. M. Dupriez, ''Dictionary of Literary Devices'' (1991) p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
Meringer and Meyer highlighted the role of familiar associations and similarities of words and sounds in producing the lapsus. Freud objected that such factors did not cause but only “''favour'' slips of the tongue...in the immense majority of cases my speech is not disturbed by the circumstance that the words I am using recall others with a similar sound...or that familiar associations branch off from them”.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Timpanaro later reignited the debate,&lt;ref&gt;P. Barrotta et al, ''Freud and Italian Culture'' (2009) p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; by maintaining that any given slip can always be explained mechanically without a need for deeper motivation.&lt;ref&gt;Greetham, ''Theories'' p. 257-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. L. Austin]] had independently seen slips not as revealing a particular complex, but as an ineluctable feature of the human condition, necessitating a continual preparation for excuses and remedial work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Cavell]], ''Little Did I Know'' (2010) p. 479&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medusa complex''' is a psychological [[Complex (psychology)|complex]] revolving around the petrification or freezing of human emotion, and drawing on the classical myth of the [[Medusa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Concise-Corsini-Encyclopedia-Psychology-Behavioral/dp/0471220361/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1529846981&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=9780471220367|title=The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science|date=2004-04-19|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780471220367|editor-last=Craighead|editor-first=W. Edward|edition= 3rd|location=New York Chichester|language=English|editor-last2=Nemeroff|editor-first2=Charles B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The term Medusa Complex was coined in 1948 by [[Gaston Bachelard]]&lt;ref&gt;F. Gleyzon, ''Shakespeare's Spiral'' (2010) p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; to cover the feeling of petrification induced by the threat of the parental [[gaze]].&lt;ref&gt;J-P Sartre, ''Saint Genet'' (2012) p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; A mute, paralysed fury responds to the danger of the obliteration of an individual consciousness by an external Other (and perhaps by the corresponding internalised desire to obliterate the subjectivity of others in turn).&lt;ref&gt;A. Passo, ''Novel Configurations'' (1994) p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments==
Later writers have developed Bachelard's idea in various ways.
* [[Attachment theory]] uses the Medusa Complex to refer to a self-destructive early state of inwardly directed aggression produced by a disruption of the mother/child mutual gaze.&lt;ref&gt;W. Craighead ed. ''The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioural Science'' (2014) p. 1044&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marion Woodman]] saw the Medusa Complex as a dissociated state produced by paralysis of the [[fight-or-flight response]] in a state of petrified fear.&lt;ref&gt;P. Bennett ed., ''Montreal 2010'' (2012) p. 1593&lt;/ref&gt;  She also saw it as the possible by-product of a conflict between an idealised, [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfect]] state and the actual reality of one's feelings and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://truebeautyalways.com/2013/03/03/waltzing-with-medusa/ Waltzing with Medusa]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marjorie Garber]] saw the Medusa Complex pervading [[Macbeth]] in the form of [[Medusa's Head|gender trauma]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Shamas, ''We Three'' (2007) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Francois-Xavier Gleyzon]] used the Medusa Complex in reference to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare’s]] ''[[King Lear]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Shakespeares-Spiral-Tracing-Renaissance-Painting-ebook/dp/B009W3W2JI/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1529847384&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=9780761848936|title=Shakespeare's Spiral: Tracing the Snail in King Lear and Renaissance Painting|last=results|first=search|date=2010-03-19|publisher=UPA|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12788">{{Criminal law}}
In UK [[criminal law]], the term "'''offence against the person'''" usually refers to a crime which is committed by direct physical harm or force being applied to another person.

They are usually analysed by division into the following categories:
*Fatal offences
*Sexual offences
*Non-fatal non-sexual offences
They can be further analysed by division into:
*Assaults
*Injuries
And it is then possible to consider degrees and aggravations, and distinguish between intentional actions (e.g., [[assault]]) and [[criminal negligence]] (e.g., criminal endangerment).

Offences against the person are usually taken to comprise:
*Fatal offences
**Murder
**Manslaughter
*Non-fatal non-sexual offences
** [[Assault]], or [[common assault]]
** [[Battery (crime)|Battery]], or common battery
** Wounding or wounding with intent
** Poisoning&lt;ref&gt;Often referred to as administration of a noxious substance in legal parlance.&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] (and derivative offences)
** Inflicting [[grievous bodily harm]] or causing grievous bodily harm with intent (and derivative offences)&lt;ref&gt;Some legal systems have two separate crimes: occasioning grievous bodily harm, and ''intentionally'' inflicting grievous bodily harm.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crimes are usually grouped together in [[common law]] countries as a legacy of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].

Although most [[sexual offence]]s will also be offences against the person,&lt;ref&gt;For example, it would be legally impossible to [[rape]] another person without also committing a [[battery (crime)|battery]] against them&lt;/ref&gt; for various reasons (including sentencing and registration of offenders) sexual crimes are usually categorised separately.  Similarly, although many [[homicide]]s also involve an offence against the person, they are usually categorised under the more serious category.

Juran]] suggested the principle and named it after Italian [[economist]] [[Vilfredo Pareto]], who noted the 80/20 connection while at the [[University of Lausanne]] in 1896, as published in his first work, ''Cours d'économie politique''. Essentially, Pareto showed that approximately 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population.

It is an axiom of business management that "80% of sales come from 20% of clients".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/229294|title=The 80/20 Rule of Sales: How to Find Your Best Customers|last=Marshall|first=Perry|date=2013-10-09|work=Entrepreneur|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Koch]] authored the book, ''The 80/20 Principle,'' which illustrated some practical applications of the Pareto principle in business management and life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The 80/20 Principle : the Secret of Achieving More with Less|last1=Koch|first1=Richard|date=1998|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=9780385491747|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematically, the 80/20 rule is roughly followed by a [[power law]] distribution (also known as a [[Pareto distribution]]) for a particular set of parameters, and many natural phenomena have been shown empirically to exhibit such a distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/cond-mat/pdf/0412/0412004v3.pdf|title=Power laws, Pareto Distributions, and Zipf's law|last=Newman|first=MEJ|page=11|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pareto principle is only tangentially related to [[Pareto efficiency]]. Pareto developed both concepts in the context of the [[distribution of income]] and wealth among the population.

== In economics ==

The original observation was in connection with population and wealth. Pareto noticed that approximately 80% of Italy's land was owned by 20% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=''Translation of'' Manuale di economia politica ("Manual of political economy") |first1=Vilfredo|last1=Pareto|first2=Alfred N.|last2=Page|publisher=A.M. Kelley|year=1971|isbn=978-0-678-00881-2|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then carried out surveys on a variety of other countries and found to his surprise that a similar distribution applied.

A chart that gave the inequality a very visible and comprehensible form, the so-called "champagne glass" effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Xabier|last=Gorostiaga|title=World has become a 'champagne glass' globalization will fill it fuller for a wealthy few|journal=National Catholic Reporter|date=January 27, 1995|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; was contained in the 1992 United Nations Development Program Report, which showed that distribution of global income is very uneven, with the richest 20% of the world's population controlling 82.7% of the world's income.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=United Nations Development Program|title=1992 Human Development Report|year=1992|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pareto principle also could be seen as applying to taxation. In the US, the top 20% of earners have paid roughly 80-90% of Federal income taxes in 2000 and 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Curtis Dubay (May 4, 2009) [https://www.heritage.org/poverty-and-inequality/report/the-rich-pay-more-taxes-top-20-percent-pay-record-share-income-taxes The Rich Pay More Taxes: Top 20 Percent Pay Record Share of Income Taxes], Heritage.org, accessed 12 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Sanders (April 6, 2018) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-20-of-americans-will-pay-87-of-income-tax-1523007001 Top 20% of Americans Will Pay 87% of Income Tax], Wall Street Journal, accessed 12 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== In software ==
In [[computer science]] the Pareto principle can be applied to [[optimization (computer science)|optimization]] efforts.&lt;ref name=optimization&gt;{{citation|first1=M.|last1=Gen|first2=R.|last2=Cheng|title=Genetic Algorithms and Engineering Optimization|location=New York|publisher=Wiley|year=2002|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Microsoft]] noted that by fixing the top 20% of the most-reported bugs, 80% of the related errors and crashes in a given system would be eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.crn.com/news/security/18821726/microsofts-ceo-80-20-rule-applies-to-bugs-not-just-features.htm|title=Microsoft's CEO: 80–20 Rule Applies To Bugs, Not Just Features|first=Paula|last=Rooney|date=October 3, 2002|publisher=ChannelWeb|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lowell Arthur]] expressed that "20 percent of the code has 80 percent of the errors. Find them, fix them!"&lt;ref&gt;Pressman, Roger S. (2010). Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach (7th ed.). Boston, Mass: McGraw-Hill, 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-07-337597-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also discovered that in general the 80% of a certain piece of software can be written in 20% of the total allocated time. Conversely, the hardest 20% of the code takes 80% of the time. This factor is usually a part of [[COCOMO]] estimating for software coding.

== In sports ==
It has been inferred the Pareto principle applies to athletic training, where roughly 20% of the exercises and habits have 80% of the impact and the trainee should not focus so much on a varied training.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://speedendurance.com/2008/11/20/training-and-the-80-20-rule-of-paretos-principle/ |title=Training and the 80-20 rule of Pareto’s Principle }}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not necessarily mean that having a healthy diet or going to the gym are not important, but they are not as significant as the key activities. It is also important to note this 80/20 rule has yet to be scientifically tested in controlled studies with regards to athletic training.

In [[baseball]], the Pareto principle has been perceived in [[Wins Above Replacement]] (an attempt to combine multiple statistics to determine a player's overall importance to a team). "15% of the all the players last year produced 85% of the total wins with the other 85% of the players creating 15% of the wins. The Pareto Principle holds up pretty soundly when it is applied to baseball..."&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Zimmerman (Jun 4, 2010). [https://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2010/6/4/1501048/applying-the-parento-principle-80 Applying the Pareto Principle (80-20 Rule) to Baseball], BeyondTheBoxScore.com, accessed 12 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately a brief look at this article's methods shows that the choice of alternate and probably better indicators of performance yields drastically different results that fail to support the Pareto Principle for this context.  Thus this probably entails an example of [[Cherry_picking|cherry-picking]].

== Occupational health and safety ==
[[Occupational health and safety]] professionals use the Pareto principle to underline the importance of hazard prioritization. Assuming 20% of the hazards account for 80% of the injuries, and by categorizing hazards, safety professionals can target those 20% of the hazards that cause 80% of the injuries or accidents. Alternatively, if hazards are addressed in random order, a safety professional is more likely to fix one of the 80% of hazards that account only for some fraction of the remaining 20% of injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodcock |first=Kathryn |title=Safety Evaluation Techniques |year=2010 |publisher= Ryerson University |location= Toronto, ON |pages=86 |url= http://www.ryerson.ca/woodcock/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from ensuring efficient accident prevention practices, the Pareto principle also ensures hazards are addressed in an economical order as the technique ensures the resources used are best used to prevent the most accidents.&lt;ref name=USCG001&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Risk-based Decision-Making |url= http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg5211/docs/RBDM_Files/PDF/RBDM_Guidelines/Volume%202/Volume%202-Chapter%206.pdf |work=USCG Safety Program |publisher= United States Coast Guard |accessdate= 14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other applications ==
In engineering control theory, such as for electromechanical energy converters, the 80/20 principle applies to optimization efforts.&lt;ref name=optimization/&gt;

The law of the few can be also seen in betting, where it is said that with 20% effort you can match the accuracy of 80% of the bettors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Pareto Principle of Prediction|url=https://www.pinnacle.com/en/betting-articles/betting-strategy/the-pareto-principle-of-prediction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the systems science discipline, [[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] created an [[Agent-based social simulation|agent-based simulation]] model called [[Sugarscape]], from a [[Decentralised system|decentralized modeling]] approach, based on individual behavior rules defined for each agent in the economy.  Wealth distribution and Pareto's 80/20 principle became emergent in their results, which suggests the principle is a collective consequence of these individual rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Epstein|first=Joshua|title=Growing Artificial Societies: Social Science from the Bottom-Up|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xXvelSs2caQC|page=208|year=1996|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=0-262-55025-3|last2=Axtell|first2=Robert}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pareto principle has many applications in quality control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=QtVmCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=The+Pareto+principle+has+many+applications+in+quality+control&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qFmwW19c5q&amp;sig=4f0n7ESBCiqhG5xY7ri0NXX5fD0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFo4_YpN7YAhULNbwKHeEQA044ChDoAQg0MAI#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Pareto%20principle%20has%20many%20applications%20in%20quality%20control&amp;f=false|title=The Pareto Principle for Business Management: Expand your business with the 80/20 rule|last=50MINUTES.COM|date=2015-08-17|publisher=50 Minutes|isbn=9782806265869|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} It is the basis for the [[Pareto chart]], one of the key tools used in [[total quality management|total quality control]] and [[Six Sigma]] techniques. The Pareto principle serves as a baseline for [[time management#abc analysis|ABC-analysis]] and XYZ-analysis, widely used in [[logistics]] and procurement for the purpose of optimizing stock of goods, as well as costs of keeping and replenishing that stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rushton|Oxley|Croucher|2000}}, pp. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

In health care in the United States, in one instance 20% of patients have been found to use 80% of health care resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projo.com/opinion/contributors/content/CT_weinberg27_07-27-09_HQF0P1E_v15.3f89889.html Myrl Weinberg: In health-care reform, the 20-80 solution | Contributors | projo.com | The Providence Journal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802002952/http://www.projo.com/opinion/contributors/content/CT_weinberg27_07-27-09_HQF0P1E_v15.3f89889.html|date=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;http://archive.li/oK3Fp&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cases of [[Super-spreader|super-spreading]] conform to the 20/80 rule,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galvani|first1=Alison P.|last2=May|first2=Robert M.|year=|title=Epidemiology: Dimensions of superspreading|url=|journal=Nature|volume=438|issue=|pages=293–295|doi=10.1038/438293a|pmid=16292292}}&lt;/ref&gt; where approximately 20% of infected individuals are responsible for 80% of transmissions, although super-spreading can still be said to occur when super-spreaders account for a higher or lower percentage of transmissions.&lt;ref name="Lloyd-Smith JO 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lloyd-Smith|first1=JO|last2=Schreiber|first2=SJ|last3=Kopp|first3=PE|last4=Getz|first4=WM|year=2005|title=Superspreading and the effect of individual variation on disease emergence|url=|journal=Nature|volume=438|issue=|pages=355–359|doi=10.1038/nature04153|pmid=16292310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[epidemic]]s with super-spreading, the majority of individuals infect relatively few [[contact tracing|secondary contacts]].

The [[Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study|Dunedin Study]] has found 80% of crimes are committed by 20% of criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Nicola|first=Davis|title='High social cost' adults can be predicted from as young as three, says study|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/dec/12/high-social-cost-adults-can-be-identified-from-as-young-as-three-says-study|year=2016|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;|publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This statistic has been used to support both [[stop-and-frisk]] policies and [[broken windows]] policing, as catching those criminals committing minor crimes will supposedly net many criminals wanted for (or who would normally commit) larger ones.  Once again, however, data from the same Dunedin study provide other results that nowhere near approximate the 80-20 principle; choose a different indicator and the 80% may become 36%.  Thus support for the applicability of the Pareto Principle again seems to require [[Cherry_picking|cherry-picking]].

== Mathematical notes ==
The idea has a rule of thumb application in many places, but it is commonly misused. For example, it is a misuse to state a solution to a problem "fits the 80/20 rule" just because it fits 80% of the cases; it must also be that the solution requires only 20% of the resources that would be needed to solve all cases. Additionally, it is a misuse of the 80/20 rule to interpret  a small number of categories or observations.

This is a special case of the wider phenomenon of [[Pareto distribution]]s. If the [[Pareto index]]&amp;nbsp;'''α''', which is one of the parameters characterizing a Pareto distribution, is chosen as '''α'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;5&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;1.16, then one has 80% of effects coming from 20% of causes.

It follows that one also has 80% of that top 80% of effects coming from 20% of that top 20% of causes, and so on. Eighty percent of 80% is 64%; 20% of 20% is 4%, so this implies a "64/4" law; and similarly implies a "51.2/0.8" law. Similarly for the bottom 80% of causes and bottom 20% of effects, the bottom 80% of the bottom 80% only cause 20% of the remaining 20%. This is broadly in line with the world population/wealth table above, where the bottom 60% of the people own 5.5% of the wealth, approximating to a 64/4 connection.

The 64/4 correlation also implies a 32% 'fair' area between the 4% and 64%, where the lower 80% of the top 20% (16%) and upper 20% of the bottom 80% (also 16%) relates to the corresponding lower top and upper bottom of effects (32%). This is also broadly in line with the world population table above, where the second 20% control 12% of the wealth, and the bottom of the top 20% (presumably) control 16% of the wealth.

The term 80/20 is only a shorthand for the general principle at work.  In individual cases, the distribution could just as well be, say, nearer to 80/20 or 70/30.  There is no need for the two numbers to add up to the number 100, as they are measures of different things, (e.g., 'number of customers' vs 'amount spent').  However, each case in which they do not add up to 100%, is equivalent to one in which they do. For example, as noted above, the "64/4 law" (in which the two numbers do not add up to 100%) is equivalent to the "80/20 law" (in which they do add up to 100%).  Thus, specifying two percentages independently does not lead to a broader class of distributions than what one gets by specifying the larger one and letting the smaller one be its complement relative to 100%.  Thus, there is only one degree of freedom in the choice of that parameter.

Adding up to 100 leads to a nice symmetry. For example, if 80% of effects come from the top 20% of sources, then the remaining 20% of effects come from the lower 80% of sources. This is called the "joint ratio", and can be used to measure the degree of imbalance: a joint ratio of 96:4 is very imbalanced, 80:20 is significantly imbalanced ([[Gini index]]: 76%), 70:30 is moderately imbalanced (Gini index: 28%), and 55:45 is just slightly imbalanced (Gini index 14%).

The Pareto principle is an illustration of a "[[power law]]" relationship, which also occurs in phenomena such as [[brush fire]]s and earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bak|first=Per|title=How Nature Works: the science of self-organized criticality|page=89|year=1999|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-387-94791-4|authorlink=Per Bak}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because it is self-similar over a wide range of magnitudes, it produces outcomes completely different from [[Normal distribution|Normal or Gaussian distribution]] phenomena. This fact explains the frequent breakdowns of sophisticated financial instruments, which are modeled on the assumption that a Gaussian relationship is appropriate to, for example, stock price movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Taleb|first=Nassim|title=[[The Black Swan (Taleb book)|The Black Swan]]|pages=229–252, 274–285|year=2007|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;|authorlink=Nassim Taleb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equality measures ==

=== Gini coefficient and Hoover index ===

Using the "''A''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''B''" notation (for example, 0.8:0.2) and with&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, [[Income inequality metrics|inequality measures]] like the [[Gini index]] (G) ''and'' the [[Hoover index]] (H) can be computed. In this case both are the same.

: &lt;math&gt;H=G=|2A-1|=|1-2B| \, &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;A:B = \left( \frac{1+H} 2 \right): \left( \frac{1-H} 2 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Theil index ===
The [[Theil index]] is an entropy measure used to quantify inequalities. The measure is 0 for 50:50 distributions and reaches 1 at a Pareto distribution of 82:18. Higher inequalities yield Theil indices above 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poorcity.richcity.org/calculator/?quantiles=82.4,17.6|17.6,82.4 On Line Calculator: Inequality&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;T_T=T_L=T_s = 2 H \, \operatorname{artanh}(H).\,&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51036">'''Peacebuilding''' is an intervention technique or method that is designed to prevent the start or resumption of violent conflict by creating a sustainable [[peace]]. Peacebuilding activities address the root causes or potential causes of violence, create a societal expectation for peaceful conflict resolution, and stabilize society politically and socioeconomically.

The activities included in peacebuilding vary depending on the situation and the agent of peacebuilding. Successful peacebuilding activities create an environment supportive of self-sustaining, durable peace; reconcile opponents; prevent conflict from restarting; integrate civil society; create [[rule of law]] mechanisms; and address underlying structural and societal issues. Researchers and practitioners also increasingly find that peacebuilding is most effective and durable when it relies upon local conceptions of peace and the underlying dynamics which foster or enable conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coning | first1 = C | year = 2013 | title = Understanding Peacebuilding as Essentially Local | url = | journal = Stability: International Journal of Security and Development | volume = 2 | issue = 1| page = 6 | doi = 10.5334/sta.as }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

The exact definition varies depending on the actor, with some definitions specifying what activities fall within the scope of peacebuilding or restricting peacebuilding to post-conflict interventions.

Even if peacebuilding has remained a largely amorphous concept without clear guidelines or goals,&lt;ref name="Jennifer M. Hazen 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = 454654 | first1 = Jennifer M. | year = 2007 | title = Can Peacekeepers Be Peacebuilders? | url = | journal = International Peacekeeping | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 323–338 | doi = 10.1080/13533310701422901 }}&lt;/ref&gt; common to all definitions is the agreement that improving [[human security]] is the central task of peacebuilding.&amp;nbsp;In this sense, peacebuilding includes a wide range of efforts by diverse actors in government and civil society at the community, national, and international levels to address the root causes of violence and ensure civilians have freedom from fear (negative peace), freedom from want (positive peace) and freedom from humiliation before, during, and after violent conflict.  &amp;nbsp;

Although many of peacebuilding's aims overlap with those of peacemaking, peacekeeping and conflict resolution, it is a distinct idea. [[Peacemaking]] involves stopping an ongoing conflict, whereas peacebuilding happens before a conflict starts or once it ends. [[Peacekeeping]] prevents the resumption of fighting following a conflict; it does not address the underlying causes of violence or work to create societal change, as peacebuilding does. Peacekeeping also differs from peacebuilding in that it only occurs after conflict ends, not before it begins. [[Conflict resolution]] does not include some components of peacebuilding, such as state building and socioeconomic development.

In 2007, the [[UN Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General's]] Policy Committee defined peacebuilding as follows: "Peacebuilding involves a range of measures targeted to reduce the risk of lapsing or relapsing into conflict by strengthening national capacities at all levels for conflict management, and to lay the foundations for sustainable peace and [[sustainable development]]. Peacebuilding strategies must be coherent and tailored to specific needs of the country concerned, based on national ownership, and should comprise a carefully prioritized, sequenced, and therefore relatively narrow set of activities aimed at achieving the above objectives."&lt;ref name="Peacebuilding and the UN" /&gt;

==Approaches to peacebuilding==

There are two broad approaches to peacebuilding.

First, peacebuilding can refer to ''direct work'' that intentionally focuses on addressing the factors driving or mitigating conflict.  When applying the term "peacebuilding" to this work, there is an explicit attempt by those designing and planning a peacebuilding effort to reduce structural or direct violence.

Second, the term peacebuilding can also refer to efforts to coordinate a multi-level, multisectoral strategy, including ensuring that there is funding and proper communication and coordination mechanisms between humanitarian assistance, development, governance, security, justice and other sectors that may not use the term "peacebuilding" to describe themselves. The concept is not one to impose on specific sectors. Rather some scholars use the term peacebuilding as an overarching concept useful for describing a range of interrelated efforts.

While some use the term to refer to only post-conflict or post-war contexts, most use the term more broadly to refer to any stage of conflict. Before conflict becomes violent, preventive peacebuilding efforts, such as diplomatic, economic development, social, educational, health, legal and security sector reform programs, address potential sources of instability and violence. This is also termed conflict prevention. Peacebuilding efforts aim to manage, mitigate, resolve and transform central aspects of the conflict through official diplomacy; as well as through civil society peace processes and informal dialogue, negotiation, and mediation. Peacebuilding addresses economic, social and political root causes of violence and fosters reconciliation to prevent the return of [[structural violence|structural]] and direct violence. Peacebuilding efforts aim to change beliefs, attitudes and behaviors to transform the short and long term dynamics between individuals and groups toward a more stable, peaceful coexistence.&amp;nbsp;Peacebuilding is an approach to an entire set of interrelated efforts that support peace.

==History==

In the 1970s, Norwegian sociologist [[Johan Galtung]] first created the term peacebuilding through his promotion of systems that would create sustainable peace. Such systems needed to address the root causes of conflict and support local capacity for peace management and conflict resolution.&lt;ref name="Peacebuilding and the UN" /&gt; Galtung's work emphasized a bottom-up approach that decentralized social and economic structures, amounting to a call for a societal shift from structures of coercion and violence to a culture of peace. American sociologist [[John Paul Lederach]] proposed a different concept of peacebuilding as engaging grassroots, local, NGO, international and other actors to create a sustainable peace process. He does not advocate the same degree of structural change as Galtung.&lt;ref&gt;Keating XXXIV&lt;/ref&gt;

Peacebuilding has since expanded to include many different dimensions, such as [[Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration|disarmament, demobilization and reintegration]] and rebuilding governmental, economic and civil society institutions.&lt;ref name="Peacebuilding and the UN" /&gt; The concept was popularized in the international community through UN Secretary-General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]]'s 1992 report [[An Agenda for Peace]]. The report defined post-conflict peacebuilding as an “action to identify and support structures which will tend to strengthen and solidify peace in order to avoid a relapse into conflict"&lt;ref name="Agenda for Peace" /&gt; At the [[2005 World Summit]], the [[United Nations]] began creating a peacebuilding architecture based on [[Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan's]] proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett 36&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal called for three organizations: the [[Peacebuilding Commission|UN Peacebuilding Commission]], which was founded in 2005; the [[United Nations Peacebuilding Fund|UN Peacebuilding Fund]], founded in 2006; and the UN Peacebuilding Support Office, which was created in 2005. These three organizations enable the Secretary-General to coordinate the UN's peacebuilding efforts.&lt;ref name="PBSO about" /&gt; National governments' interest in the topic has also increased due to fears that [[failed states]] serve as breeding grounds for conflict and extremism and thus threaten international security. Some states have begun to view peacebuilding as a way to demonstrate their relevance.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett 43&lt;/ref&gt; However, peacebuilding activities continue to account for small percentages of states' budgets.&lt;ref name="Barnett 53"&gt;Barnett 53&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Marshall Plan]] was a long-term postconflict peacebuilding intervention in Europe with which the United States aimed to rebuild the continent following the destruction of World War II. The Plan successfully promoted economic development in the areas it funded.&lt;ref&gt;Sandole 92, 101&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, peacebuilding has been implemented in postconflict situations in countries including [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Kosovo]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Cyprus]], and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandole 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components of peacebuilding==
The activities included in peacebuilding vary depending on the situation and the agent of peacebuilding. Successful peacebuilding activities create an environment supportive of self-sustaining, durable peace; reconcile opponents; prevent conflict from restarting; integrate civil society; create rule of law mechanisms; and address underlying structural and societal issues. To accomplish these goals, peacebuilding must address functional structures, emotional conditions and social psychology, social stability, rule of law and ethics, and cultural sensitivities.&lt;ref name="Peacebuilding" /&gt;

Preconflict peacebuilding interventions aim to prevent the start of violent conflict.&lt;ref name="Keating XXXVII"&gt;Keating XXXVII&lt;/ref&gt; These strategies involve a variety of actors and sectors in order to transform the conflict.&lt;ref name="Sandole 13-14"&gt;Sandole 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the definition of peacebuilding includes preconflict interventions, in practice most peacebuilding interventions are postconflict.&lt;ref&gt;Sandole 12&lt;/ref&gt; However, many peacebuilding scholars advocate an increased focus on preconflict peacebuilding in the future.&lt;ref name="Keating XXXVII"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sandole 13-14"/&gt;

There are many different approaches to categorization of forms of peacebuilding among the peacebuilding field's many scholars.

Barnett ''et al.'' divides postconflict peacebuilding into three dimensions: stabilizing the post-conflict zone, restoring state institutions, and dealing with social and economic issues. Activities within the first dimension reinforce state stability post-conflict and discourage former combatants from returning to war ([[Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration|disarmament, demobilization and reintegration]], or DDR). Second dimension activities build state capacity to provide basic public goods and increase state legitimacy. Programs in the third dimension build a post-conflict society's ability to manage conflicts peacefully and promote socioeconomic development.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett et al 49-50&lt;/ref&gt;

A mixture of locally and internationally focused components is key to building a long-term sustainable peace.&lt;ref name="Peacebuilding" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mac Ginty 212&lt;/ref&gt; Mac Ginty says that while different "indigenous" communities utilize different conflict resolution techniques, most of them share the common characteristics described in the table below. Since indigenous peacebuilding practices arise from local communities, they are tailored to local context and culture in a way that generalized international peacebuilding approaches are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mac Ginty | first1 = R | year = 2012 | title = Against Stabilization | url = | journal = Stability: International Journal of Security and Development | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 20–30 | doi = 10.5334/sta.ab }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major organizations==

===Intergovernmental organizations===
The [[United Nations]] participates in many aspects of peacebuilding, both through the peacebuilding architecture established in 2005-6 and through other agencies.
* Peacebuilding architecture
** [[Peacebuilding Commission|UN Peacebuilding Commission]] (PBC): intergovernmental advisory body&lt;ref name="PBSO about" /&gt; that brings together key actors, gathers resources, advises on strategies for post-conflict peacebuilding and highlights issues that might undermine peace.&lt;ref name="PBC Mandate" /&gt;
** [[United Nations Peacebuilding Fund|UN Peacebuilding Fund]] (PBF): supports peacebuilding activities that directly promote post-conflict stabilization and strengthen state and institutional capacity. PBF funding is either given for a maximum of two years immediately following conflict to jumpstart peacebuilding and recovery needs or given for up to three years to create a more structured peacebuilding process.&lt;ref name="PBF how we fund" /&gt;
** UN Peacebuilding Support Office (PBSO): supports the Peacebuilding Commission with strategic advice and policy guidance, administers the Peacebuilding Fund and helps the Secretary-General coordinate UN agencies' peacebuilding efforts.&lt;ref name="PBSO about" /&gt;
* Other agencies
**[[Peacebuilding Portal]]: provides information and develops communication networks in the peacebuilding community to build local, national, intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations' capacity
**[[United Nations Department of Political Affairs|UN Department of Political Affairs]]: postconflict peacebuilding
**[[United Nations Development Programme|UN Development Programme]]: conflict prevention, peacebuilding, postconflict recovery&lt;ref name="Barnett et al. 38"&gt;Barnett et al. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]] focus on the economic and financial aspects of peacebuilding. The World Bank assists in post-conflict reconstruction and recovery by helping rebuild society's socioeconomic framework. The International Monetary Fund deals with post-conflict recovery and peacebuilding by acting to restore assets and production levels.&lt;ref name="Barnett et al. 38"/&gt;

The [[European Union|EU]]'s [[European Commission]] describes its peacebuilding activities as conflict prevention and management, and rehabilitation and reconstruction. Conflict prevention and management entails stopping the imminent outbreak of violence and encouraging a broad peace process. Rehabilitation and reconstruction deals with rebuilding the local economy and institutional capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett et al. 43&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission Conflict Prevention and Peace building 2001-2010 was subjected to a major external evaluation conducted by Aide a la Decisions Economique (ADE) with the [[European Centre for Development Policy Management]] which was presented in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;ADE, Thematic Evaluation of European Commission Support to Conflict Prevention and Peace-building, Evaluation for the Evaluation Unit of DEVCO, October 2011, http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/how/evaluation/evaluation_reports/2011/1291_docs_en.htm&lt;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European External Action Service]] created in 2010 also has a specific Division of Conflict Prevention, Peacebuilding and Mediation.

==Role of women==
Women have traditionally played a limited role in peacebuilding processes even though they often bear the responsibility for providing for their families' basic needs in the aftermath of violent conflict. They are especially likely to be unrepresented or underrepresented in negotiations, political decision-making, upper-level policymaking and senior judicial positions. Many societies' [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] cultures prevent them from recognizing the role women can play in peacebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;Porter 190&lt;/ref&gt; However, many peacebuilding academics and the United Nations have recognized that women play a vital role in securing the three pillars of sustainable peace: economic recovery and reconciliation, social cohesion and development and political legitimacy, security and governance.&lt;ref name="Policy Issues" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porter 184&lt;/ref&gt;

At the request of the Security Council, the Secretary-General issued a report on women's participation in peacebuilding in 2010. The report outlines the challenges women continue to face in participating in recovery and peacebuilding process and the negative impact this exclustion has on them and societies more broadly. To respond to these challenges, it advocates a comprehensive 7-point action plan covering the seven commitment areas: mediation; post-conflict planning; financing; civilian capacity; post-conflict governance; rule of law; and economic recovery. The action plan aims to facilitate progress on the women, peace and security agenda. The monitoring and implementation of this action plan is now being led jointly by the Peacebuilding Support Office and UN Women.&lt;ref name="UN Women" /&gt; In April 2011, the two organizations convened a workshop to ensure that women are included in future post-disaster and post-conflict planning documents. In the same year, the PBF selected seven gender-sensitive peacebuilding projects to receive $5 million in funding.&lt;ref name="Policy Issues" /&gt;

Porter discusses the growing role of female leadership in countries prone to war and its impact on peacebuilding. When the book was written, seven countries prone to violent conflict had female heads of state. [[Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf]] of [[Liberia]] and [[Michelle Bachelet]] of [[Chile]] were the first female heads of state from their respective countries and President Johnson-Sirleaf was the first female head of state in Africa. Both women utilized their gender to harness "the power of maternal symbolism - the hope that a woman could best close wounds left on their societies by war and dictatorship."&lt;ref&gt;Porter 185&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ongoing efforts==
[[File:UN Peacebuilding Commission and UN Peacebuilding Fund locations.svg|thumb|right|285px|{{legend|#F8A20C|Ongoing UN PBC and PBF projects&lt;ref name="PBC Homepage" /&gt; }} {{legend|#3CE67B|Ongoing UN PBF projects&lt;ref name="PBF Countries" /&gt;}}]]

The UN Peacebuilding Commission works in [[Burundi]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]]&lt;ref name="PBC Homepage" /&gt; and the UN Peacebuilding Fund funds projects in Burundi, Central African Republic, [[Chad]], [[Comoros]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], Guinea, Guinea Bissau, [[Guatemala]], [[Haiti]], [[Kenya]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Lebanon]], Liberia, [[Nepal]], [[Niger]], Sierra Leone, [[Somalia]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sudan]], [[South Sudan]], [[Timor-Leste]] and [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name="PBF Countries" /&gt; Other UN organizations are working in Haiti ([[MINUSTAH]]),&lt;ref&gt;Keating 120&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanon,&lt;ref&gt;Mac Ginty 180&lt;/ref&gt; [[Afghanistan]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Iraq]].

The World Bank's [[International Development Association]] maintains the Trust Fund for East Timor in Timor-Leste. The TFET has assisted reconstruction, community empowerment and local governance in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Keating XLII-XLIII&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] and the [[Iraq War|War in Iraq]], the United States has invested $104 billion in reconstruction and relief efforts for the two countries. The [[Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund]] alone received $21 billion during FY2003 and FY2004.&lt;ref&gt;Tarnoff 14&lt;/ref&gt; The money came from the [[United States Department of State]], [[United States Agency for International Development]] and the [[United States Department of Defense]] and included funding for security, health, education, social welfare, governance, economic growth and humanitarian issues.&lt;ref&gt;Tarnoff 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil society organisations sometimes even are working on Peacebuilding themselves. This for example is the case in Kenya, according to the magazine [http://www.dandc.eu/articles/220704/index.en.shtml D+C Development and Cooperation]. After the election riots in Kenya in 2008, civil society organisations started programmes to avoid similar disasters in the future, for instance the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC) and peace meetings organised by the church and they supported the National Cohesion and Integration Commission.

==Results==
In 2010, the UNPBC conducted a review of its work with the first four countries on its agenda.&lt;ref name="2010 PBC Report" /&gt; An independent review by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting also highlighted some of the PBC's early successes and challenges.&lt;ref name="Pulitzer Report" /&gt;

One comprehensive study finds that UN peacebuilding missions significantly increase the likelihood of democratization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Too good to be true? United Nations peacebuilding and the democratization of war-torn states|url = http://cmp.sagepub.com/content/32/5/513|journal = Conflict Management and Peace Science|date = 2015-11-01|issn = 0738-8942|pages = 513–535|volume = 32|issue = 5|doi = 10.1177/0738894214559671|language = en|first = Janina Isabel|last = Steinert|first2 = Sonja|last2 = Grimm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

Jennifer Hazen &lt;ref name="Jennifer M. Hazen 2007"/&gt; contends there are two major debates relating to peacebuilding; the first centres on the role of the liberal democratic model in designing peacebuilding activities and measuring outcomes and the other one questions the role of third-party actors in peacebuliding.

Regarding the debate about the role of the liberal democratic model in peacebuilding, one side contends that liberal democracy is a viable end goal for peacebuilding activities in itself but that the activities implemented to achieve it need to be revised; a rushed transition to democratic elections and market economy can undermine stability and elections held or economic legislation enacted are an inappropriate yardstick for success. Institutional change is necessary and transitions need to be incremental.
Another side contends that liberal democracy might be an insufficient or even inappropriate goal for peacebuilding efforts and that the focus must be on a social transformation to develop non-violent mechanisms of conflict resolution regardless of their form.&lt;ref name="Jennifer M. Hazen 2007"/&gt;

With regards to the role of third-party actors, David Chandler &lt;ref&gt;David Chandler, Empire in Denial: The Politics of State-building, London: Pluto Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; contends that external support creates dependency and undermines local and domestic politics, thus undermining autonomy and the capacity for self-governance and leaving governments weak and dependent on foreign assistance once the third-party actors depart. Since the logic of peacebuilding relies on building and strengthening institutions to alter societal beliefs and behaviour, success relies on the populations' endorsement of these institutions. Any third party attempt at institution building without genuine domestic support will result in hollow institutions - this can lead to a situation in which democratic institutions are established before domestic politics have developed in a liberal, democratic fashion, and an unstable polity.

[[Séverine Autesserre]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Autesserre|first1=Severine|title=Peaceland: Conflict Resolution and the Everyday Politics of International Intervention|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a different approach, which focuses on the role of everyday practices in peacebuilding. She argue that the foreign peace builders' everyday practices, habits, and narratives strongly influence peacebuilding effectiveness. Autesserre stresses that international peacebuilders do not fully understand the conflicts they are trying to resolve because they rarely include local leaders in decision making, do not speak the local languages, and do not stay posted long enough to oversee effective change. This leaves decision makers out of touch with the key players in the peacebuilding process.

Jeremy Weinstein challenges the assumption that weak and failing states cannot rebuild themselves. He contends that through the process of autonomous recovery, international peacekeeping missions can be unnecessary for recovery because they assume that conflicts cannot be resolved by the country internally.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cgdev.org/publication/autonomous-recovery-and-international-intervention-comparative-perspective-working-paper|title=Autonomous Recovery and International Intervention in Comparative Perspective - Working Paper 57|last=Weinstein|first=Jeremy|date=|work=Center For Global Development|access-date=2017-05-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes autonomous recovery as a "process through which countries achieve a lasting peace, a systematic reduction in violence, and postwar political and economic development in the absence of international intervention".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through peace and institutions generated by allowing war to run its natural course, autonomous recovery can be viewed as a success. He claims that war leads to peace by allowing the naturally stronger belligerent gain power, rather than a brokered peace deal that leaves two sides still capable of fighting. Secondly he claims that war provides a competition among providers of public goods until one can control a monopoly. He says that war can create an incentive to create institutions at all levels in order to consolidate power and extract resources from the citizens while also giving some power to the citizens depending upon how much the institutions rely on them for tax revenues.

Virginia Fortna of Columbia University, however, holds that peacekeeping interventions actually do substantively matter following the end of a civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~vpf4/pkISQ%20offprint.PDF|title=Does Peacekeeping Keep Peace? International Intervention and the Duration of Peace After Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Virginia|date=|website=International Studies Quarterly|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that selection bias, where opponents point only to failed peacekeeping interventions and do not compare these missions to those situations where interventions do not occur, is partly to blame for criticisms. Fortna says that peacekeeping missions rarely go into easily resolvable situations while they are sent into tougher, more risky post war situations where missions are more likely to fail, and peace agreements are unlikely to be committed to. When all factors of a certain peacekeeping case study are properly considered, Fortna shows that peacekeeping missions do in fact help increase the chances of sustained peace after a civil war.

===Implementation===
[[Michael N. Barnett|Barnett]] ''et al.'' criticizes peacebuilding organizations for undertaking supply-driven rather than demand-driven peacebuilding; they provide the peacebuilding services in which their organization specializes, not necessarily those that the recipient most needs.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett 48&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he argues that many of their actions are based on organizations precedent rather than empirical analysis of which interventions are and are not effective.&lt;ref name="Barnett 53"/&gt; More recently, Ben Hillman has criticized international donor efforts to strengthen local governments in the wake of conflict. He argues that international donors typically do not have the knowledge, skills or resources to bring meaningful change to the way post-conflict societies are governed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crawford.anu.edu.au/pdf/staff/ben_hillman/2013/The-Policymaking-Dimension-of-Post-conflict-governance.pdf {{cite journal |last=Hillman |first=Ben |title= The Policymaking Dimension of Post-Conflict Governance: the Experience of Aceh, Indonesia |journal= Conflict Security and Development |volume=11 |issue=5 |year=2011 |pages=133–153] |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://crawford.anu.edu.au/pdf/staff/ben_hillman/2013/PUBLIC-ADMINISTRATION-REFORM-IN-POST-CONFLICT-SOCIETIES.pdf {{cite journal |last=Hillman |first=Ben |title= Public Administration Reform in Post-Conflict Societies: Lessons from Aceh, Indonesia |journal=Public Administration and Development |volume=33 |year=2012 |pages=1–14] |doi= 10.1002/pad.1643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perpetuation of cultural hegemony===
Many academics argue that peacebuilding is a manifestation of [[liberal internationalism]] and therefore imposes [[Western Culture|Western]] values and practices onto other cultures. Mac Ginty states that although peacebuilding does not project all aspects of Western culture on to the recipient states, it does transmit some of them, including concepts like [[neoliberalism]] that the West requires recipients of aid to follow more closely than most Western countries do.&lt;ref&gt;Mac Ginty 38&lt;/ref&gt; Barnett also comments that the promotion of liberalization and democratization may undermine the peacebuilding process if security and stable institutions are not pursued concurrently.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett 51&lt;/ref&gt; Richmond has shown how 'liberal peacebuilding' represents a political encounter that may produce a post-liberal form of peace. Local and international actors, norms, institutions and interests engage with each other in various different contexts, according to their respective power relations and their different conceptions of legitimate authority structures.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver P Richmond, ''A Post-Liberal Peace'', Routledge, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pharmacological torture''' is the use of [[psychotropic]] or other [[drugs]] to punish or extract information from a person.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"[http://www.uia.be/sites/uia.be/db/db/x.php?dbcode=pr&amp;go=e&amp;id=11546960 Pharmacological Torture"] World Problems Online.  Union of International Associations&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is to force compliance by causing distress, which could be in the form of pain, anxiety, psychological disturbance, immobilization, or disorientation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One form of this [[torture]] involves forcibly injecting a person with [[addictive drug]]s in order to induce physical dependence. The drug is then withdrawn, and, once the person is in [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]], the interrogation is started. If the person complies with the torturer's demands, the drug is reintroduced, relieving the person's withdrawal symptoms.{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=73}}

==Alleged use ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2014}}

===Brazil===
In Brazil, pharmacological torture involved the injection of alcohol into the tongue in the 1940s, the injection of ether into the scrotum in the 1960s, and drugs were used to cause strong contractions in the 1970s. Also, [[muscle relaxant]]s were used to minimize muscular rigidity and bone fractures caused by [[electric shock]] in the 1970s.{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=309}}

===Romania===
In the 1960s, prisoners were reportedly given drugs to make them talk in their sleep.{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=396}}

===South Africa===
In 2013, leaked video footage shot inside South Africa's [[Mangaung Prison]] showed a prisoner with no record of mental illness being forcibly injected, apparently with anti-psychotic drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-24694214 | title= 'Shocking' abuse claims at South Africa's Mangaung prison | date= 2013-10-28 | accessdate = 2015-12-01 |work= [[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Legal Resources Centre]], a non-governmental organization, is representing 13 clients who allege they were forcibly injected with the drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lrc.org.za/lrc-in-the-news/3657-tortured-mangaung-prisoners-seek-justice | title= Tortured Mangaung prisoners seek justice | date= 2015-11-27 | accessdate = 2015-12-01 |work= [[Legal Resources Centre]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
In the former [[Soviet Union]], drugs were allegedly used as a form of punishment. [[Haloperidol]], an [[antipsychotic]] medication, was a preferred agent. It was used to induce intense restlessness and [[Parkinson's]]-type symptoms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}} Another antipsychotic medication, chlorpromazine, was also used to induce grogginess, sedation, and (in high doses) [[vegetative state]]s. Other alleged uses of pharmacological torture included:
*Use of [[insulin shock therapy]] to render people [[coma]]tose.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}
*Administering [[Sulfazin]] to induce severe [[fever]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}
*Use of [[sodium amobarbital]] with [[LSD]] to cause loss of inhibition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

===United States===

In the [[United States]], in a series of hearings in the fall and winter of 1977, Congressional committees drew forth disclosure of project [[MKULTRA]], which was most active between 1953 and 1966 and conducted experiments that included the [[CIA]] agents administering [[LSD]] and [[Truth Serum]] to soldiers, citizens, and foreign nationals without their knowledge or consent.  Activities of [[MKULTRA]] resulted in at least one death, that of [[Frank Olson]], an army scientist who was given LSD without his knowledge, and committed suicide as a result of his experience.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Crewdson and Jo Thomas for the New York Times. September 20, 1977. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A02EEDA1E3FE334BC4851DFBF66838C669EDE  Abuses in Testing Of Drugs by C.I.A.

In 1953 [[Harold Blauer]] died in a New York State psychiatric institute after doctors there administered [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine]] derivatives to him without his consent, as part of a 1950s secret program run by the US army that tested [[chemical warfare agents]] on US citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press in the Los Angeles Times.

==Fictional use==
In the television series, ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', a fictional drug called "hyoscine-pentothal" was used to inflict pain on characters during interrogations in several episodes.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Burstein, Arne J.

The '''philosophy of self''' defines, among other things, the conditions of identity that make one subject of experience distinct from all others. Contemporary discussions on the nature of the [[self]] are not thereby discussions on the nature of personhood, or personal identity. The self is sometimes understood as a unified being essentially connected to consciousness, awareness, and agency (or, at least, with the faculty of rational choice). Various theories on the metaphysical nature of the self have been proposed. Among them, the metaphysical nature of the self has been proposed to be that of an immaterial substance.

== Definitions of the self ==
Most philosophical definitions of self—per [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[David Hume|Hume]], and [[William James]]—are expressed in the first person.&lt;ref&gt;Gaynesford, M. de ''I: The Meaning of the First Person Term'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A third person definition does not refer to specific mental [[Quale|qualia]] but instead strives for [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and [[operationalism]].

To another person, the self of one [[Individual Philosophy|individual]] is exhibited in the conduct and discourse of that individual. Therefore, the [[intention]]s of another individual can only be inferred from something that emanates from that individual. The particular characteristics of the self determine its [[identity (social science)|identity]].

== Concepts of self ==

=== Self in Eastern traditions ===
In [[spirituality]], and especially [[nondual]], [[mysticism|mystical]] and eastern [[meditation|meditative]] traditions, the human being is often conceived as being in the illusion of individual existence, and separateness from other aspects of creation. This "sense of doership" or sense of individual existence is that part which believes it is the human being, and believes it must fight for itself in the world, is ultimately [[self-awareness|unaware]] and [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] of its own true nature. The [[ego, super-ego, and id|ego]] is often associated with [[mind]] and the sense of [[time]], which compulsively [[thinking|thinks]] in order to be assured of its future existence, rather than simply knowing its own self and the present.

The spiritual goal of many [[tradition]]s involves the dissolving of the ego, allowing self-knowledge of one's own true nature to become experienced and enacted in the world. This is variously known as [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], [[nirvana]], presence, and the "here and now".

=== Self-knowledge ===
{{Expand section|date=January 2007}}
Both western and oriental civilizations have been occupied with self-knowledge and underscored its importance particularly citing the paradoxical combination of immediate availability and profound obscurity involved in its pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Self Knowledge in Thomas Aquinas: The Angelic Doctor on the Soul's Knowledge of Itself|last=Lambert|first=Richard|publisher=Author House|year=2007|isbn=9781420889659|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Socrates, the goal of philosophy was to "[[Know thyself]]". [[Lao Tzu]], in his ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'', says "Knowing others is wisdom. Knowing the self is enlightenment. Mastering others requires force. Mastering the self requires strength."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laozi|first=Lao Tsu|title=Tao Te Ching|isbn=978-0-679-72434-6|publisher=Vintage Books|year=1989|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case is the same for the seers of [[Upanishads]], who maintained that the ultimate real knowledge involves an understanding of the essence of the self and the nature of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hinduism: Analytical Study|last=Mohapatra|first=Amulya|last2=Mohapatra|first2=Bijaya|publisher=Mittal Publications|year=1993|isbn=8170993881|location=New Delhi|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adi Shankaracharya]], in his commentary on [[Bhagavad Gita]] says "[[Self-knowledge (Vedanta)|Self-knowledge]] alone eradicates misery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alladi|first=Mahadeva Sastry|title=The [[Bhagavad Gita]] with the commentary of Sri [[Sankaracharya]]|publisher=Samata Books|year=1992|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Self-knowledge alone is the means to the highest bliss.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alladi|first=Mahadeva Sastry|title=The [[Bhagavad Gita]] with the commentary of Sri [[Sankaracharya]]|publisher=Samata Books|year=1992|page=500}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Absolute perfection is the consummation of Self-knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alladi|first=Mahadeva Sastry|title=The [[Bhagavad Gita]] with the commentary of Sri [[Sankaracharya]]|publisher=Samata Books|year=1992|page=484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A theory about self-knowledge describes the concept as the capacity to detect that the sensations, thoughts, mental states, and attitudes as one's own.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Self-Knowledge|last=Gertler|first=Brie|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=0203835670|location=Oxon|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is linked to other concepts such as [[self-awareness]] and self-conception. The rationalist theory, which [[Immanuel Kant]] has inspired, also claims that our ability to achieve self-knowledge through rational reflection is partly derived from the fact that we view ourselves as rational agents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This school rejects that self-knowledge is merely derived from [[observation]] as it acknowledges the subject as authoritative on account of his ability as an agent to shape his own states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kant and the Problem of Self-Knowledge|last=Gorgione|first=Luca|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=9781138385467|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self as an activity ===

[[Aristotle]], following [[Plato]], defined the [[soul]] as the core [[essence]] of a living being, but argued against its having a separate existence. For instance, if a knife had a soul, the act of cutting would be that soul, because 'cutting' is the essence of what it is to be a knife. Unlike Plato and the religious traditions, Aristotle did not consider the soul as some kind of separate, ghostly occupant of the body (just as we cannot separate the activity of cutting from the knife). As the soul, in Aristotle's view, is an activity of the body, it cannot be immortal (when a knife is destroyed, the cutting stops). More precisely, the soul is the "first activity" of a living body. This is a state, or a potential for actual, or 'second', activity. "The axe has an edge for cutting" was, for Aristotle, analogous to "humans have bodies for rational activity," and the potential for rational activity thus constituted the essence of a human soul. Aristotle used his concept of the soul in many of his works; the ''[[De Anima]]'' (On the Soul) provides a good place to start to gain more understanding of his views.

[[Aristotle]] also believed that there were four sections of the soul: the calculative and scientific parts on the rational side used for making decisions, and the desiderative and vegetative parts on the irrational side responsible for identifying our needs.

=== Self independent of the senses ===
{{main|Avicennism}}

While he was imprisoned in a castle, [[Avicenna]] wrote his famous "[[Floating man|Floating Man]]" [[thought experiment]] to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and the substantiality of the [[soul]]. His "Floating Man" thought experiment tells its readers to imagine themselves suspended in the air, isolated from all sensations, which includes no [[Sense|sensory]] contact with even their own bodies. He argues that, in this scenario, one would still have [[self-consciousness]]. He thus concludes that the idea of the self is not [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|logically]] dependent on any physical [[Object (philosophy)|thing]], and that the soul should not be seen in [[relative term]]s, but as a primary [[:wikt:given|given]], a [[Substance theory|substance]]. This argument was later refined and simplified by [[René Descartes]] in [[epistemic]] terms when he stated: "I can abstract from the supposition of all external things, but not from the supposition of my own consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed [[Hossein Nasr]] and [[Oliver Leaman]] (1996), ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', p. 315, [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-415-13159-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bundle theory of self ===

[[David Hume]] pointed out that we tend to think that we are the same person we were five years ago. Though we have changed in many respects, the same person appears present as was present then. We might start thinking about which features can be changed without changing the underlying self. Hume, however, denies that there is a distinction between the various features of a person and the mysterious self that supposedly bears those features. When we start introspecting, "we are never intimately conscious of anything but a particular perception; man is a bundle or collection of different perceptions which succeed one another with an inconceivable rapidity and are in perpetual flux and movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hume|first=David|title=[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]}} I, IV, vi&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is plain, that in the course of our thinking, and in the constant revolution of our ideas, our imagination runs easily from one idea to any other that resembles it, and that this quality alone is to the fancy a sufficient bond and association. It is likewise evident that as the senses, in changing their objects, are necessitated to change them regularly, and take them as they lie contiguous to each other, the imagination must by long custom acquire the same method of thinking, and run along the parts of space and time in conceiving its objects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hume|first=David|title=[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]}} 4.1, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On Hume's view, these perceptions do not belong to anything. Rather, Hume compares the soul to a commonwealth, which retains its identity not by virtue of some enduring core substance, but by being composed of many different, related, and yet constantly changing elements. The question of personal identity then becomes a matter of characterizing the loose cohesion of one's personal experience. (Note that in the Appendix to the ''Treatise'', Hume said mysteriously that he was dissatisfied with his account of the self, yet he never returned to the issue.) Hume’s position is very similar to Indian Buddhists’ conception of the self.

The paradox of the [[Ship of Theseus]] can be used as an analogy of the self as a bundle of parts in flux.

=== Self as a narrative center of gravity ===

Daniel Dennett has a deflationary theory of the "self". Selves are not physically detectable. Instead, they are a kind of [[Fictionalism|convenient fiction]], like a [[center of gravity]], which is convenient as a way of solving physics problems, although they need not correspond to anything tangible — the center of gravity of a hoop is a point in thin air. People constantly tell themselves stories to make sense of their world, and they feature in the stories as a character, and that convenient but fictional character is the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cogprints.org/266/1/selfctr.htm|title=The Self as a Center of Narrative Gravity|last=Dennett|first=Daniel|year=1986|accessdate=2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oswego.edu/~delancey/471_DIR/471_LECTURES/DennettSelf.html|title=The Self as a Centre of Narrative Gravity|last=Dennett|first=Daniel|publisher=State University of New York|accessdate=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Buddha===

{{main|Anatta}}

The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] in particular [[Anatta|attacked]] all attempts to conceive of a fixed self, while stating that holding the view "I have no self" is also mistaken. This is an example of the [[middle way]] charted by the Buddha and the [[Madhyamaka]] school of Buddhism.

'''Pirate Party''' is a label adopted by [[political party|political parties]] in different countries. Pirate parties support [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]], [[direct democracy]] ([[e-democracy]]) and [[Participatory democracy|participation in government]], reform of [[copyright]] and [[patent law]], free sharing of knowledge ([[open content]]), [[information privacy]], [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]], [[freedom of information]], [[free speech]], [[Political corruption|anti-corruption]] and [[net neutrality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pp-international.net/about|title=About the PPI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first Pirate Party to be established was the [[Pirate Party of Sweden]] ({{lang-sv|Piratpartiet}}), whose website was launched on 1 January 2006 by [[Rick Falkvinge]]. Falkvinge was inspired to found the party after he found that Swedish politicians were generally unresponsive to Sweden's debate over changes to [[copyright law]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=nate&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Nate|title=Political pirates: A history of Sweden's Piratpartiet|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/02/rick-falkvinge-is-the-face/|accessdate=7 August 2015|work=Ars Technica|date=26 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Pirate Party]] was founded on 6 June 2006 by [[University of Georgia]] graduate student Brent Allison. The party's concerns were abolishing the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], reducing the length of copyrights from 95 years after publication or 70 years after the author's death to 14 years, and the expiry of [[patents]] that do not result in significant progress after four years, as opposed to 20 years. However, Allison stepped down as leader three days after founding the party.&lt;ref name=uspp&gt;{{cite news|last1=Downie|first1=James|title=What is the Pirate Party—and why is it helping Wikileaks?|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/world/81963/pirate-party-wikileaks|accessdate=7 August 2015|work=New Republic|date=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pirate Party of Austria]] ({{lang-de|Piratenpartei Österreichs}}) was founded in July 2006 in the run-up to the [[Austrian legislative election, 2006|2006 Austrian legislative election]] by [[Florian Hufsky]] and Jürgen "Juxi" Leitner.&lt;ref name=fuzo&gt;{{cite news|last1=Igler|first1=Nadja|title=Österreichs Piraten sehen grün|url=http://www.fuzo-archiv.at/artikel/137321v2|accessdate=7 August 2015|work=Future Zone|date=19 September 2006|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pirate Party of Finland]] was founded in 2008 and entered the official registry of Finnish political parties in 2009.

The [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 European Parliament election]] took place between the 4 and 7 June 2009, and various Pirate Parties stood candidates.

[[Czech Pirate Party]]  entered the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] of the Czech Parliament for the first time after the [[Czech legislative election, 2017|election]] held on 20 and 21 October 2017 with 10.79%.

[[Czech Pirate Party]], after finishing at the second place at the [[Prague municipal election, 2018]], held on 5 and 6 of October 2018, with 17.1%, formed a coallition with [[Prague Toghether]] and [[United Forces for Prague]] ([[TOP 09]], [[Mayors and Independents]], [[KDU-ČSL]], [[Liberal-Environmental Party]] and [[SNK European Democrats]]). The representant of the [[Czech Pirate Party]], [[Zdeněk Hřib]], was selected as a [[Mayor of Prague]]. It is probably for the first time, when any pirate party has a mayor in one of the major cities of the world.

===Pirate Parties International===
{{Main|Pirate Parties International}}
Pirate Parties International (PPI) is the umbrella organization of the national Pirate Parties. Since 2006, the organization has existed as a loose union&lt;ref name=ppiwiki&gt;[http://int.piratenpartei.de/Pirate_Parties_International Pirate Parties International] in the wiki of Pirate Parties International, retrieved 2011-01-21&lt;/ref&gt; of the national parties. Since October 2009, Pirate Parties International has had the status of a [[non-governmental organization]] (Feitelijke vereniging) based in [[Belgium]]. The organization was officially founded at a conference from 16 to 18 April 2010 in [[Brussels]], when the organization's statutes were adopted by the 22 national pirate parties represented at the event.&lt;ref name='ppint_node471'&gt;{{cite news|title = 22 Pirate Parties from all over the world officially founded the Pirate Parties International|date = 2010-04-21|url = http://pp-international.net/node/471|work = [[Pirate Parties International]]|accessdate = 2012-04-05|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120304230536/http://www.pp-international.net/node/471|archivedate = 4 March 2012|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Pirate Party===
{{Main|European Pirate Party}}
The '''European Pirate Party''' ('''PPEU''') is a [[European political party]] founded in March 2014 which consists of various pirate parties within European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://piratetimes.net/here-comes-the-european-pirate-party/|title=Here comes the European Pirate Party|work=PirateTimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pirates without Borders===
Pirates Without Borders is an international association of pirates. Unlike Pirate Parties International (which accepts only parties as voting members and organizations as observing members), Pirates Without Borders accept individuals as members. The PWB see themselves as a basis for international projects. Through global cooperation, they strive to reveal the impact of multinational trade agreements on all people on Earth, and foster freedom and democracy.&lt;ref name='pwb_wiki'&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wiki.pirates-without-borders.org/Main_Page|title = Pirates without Borders Wiki|accessdate = 2012-04-05|publisher = Pirates without Borders}}&lt;/ref&gt; PWB originates from an independent committee for the coordination of Pirate parties in German-speaking countries, known as DACHLuke (DACHL = Germany-Austria-Switzerland-Luxembourg).

Since the Pirate Parties International Conference 2011 on 12 and 13 March 2011, PWB is an "observing member" of Pirate Parties International. The previously independent project "pirate streaming" has become a part of Pirates without Borders since 3 May 2011.

===Parti Pirate Francophone===
In Parti Pirate Francophone, the French-speaking Pirate Parties are organized. Current members are the pirates parties in Belgium, Côte d'Ivoire, France, Canada, and Switzerland. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

A '''post-war period''' or '''postwar period''' is the interval immediately following the end of a [[war]]. A post-war period can become an [[interwar period]] or [[interbellum]], when a war between the same parties resumes at a later date (e.g., the period between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]). By contrast, a post-war period marks the cessation of conflict entirely.

In [[Western world|Western]] usage, references to the '''post-war era''' or '''postwar era''' (sometimes capitalized) usually refer to the time since the end of [[World War II]], although many nations involved in the Second World War have been involved in wars since.

==Post-war==

===Chronology of the post–World War II era===

The term "post-war" can have different meanings in different countries and refer to a period determined by local considerations based on the effect of the war there. In Britain, "post-war" refers to the period from the election of [[Clement Attlee]] in 1945 to that of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1979, a period of so-called [[post-war consensus]], while it may also refer to a shorter period, ending in 1960 or shortly after and corresponding to the 1950s era, hence 1945–1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/aec-lorries-post-war-years-1945-1979-248690820 AEC Lorries in the post war years 1945–1979 book (09/10/2011)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~weterb/The%20Post.htm The Post-War Years 1945 – 1960&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://economics.about.com/od/useconomichistory/a/post_war.htm The Post War Economy: 1945–1960&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold War era===
Considering the post-war era as equivalent to the [[Cold War]] era, post-war sometimes includes the 1980s, putting the end at December 1991, with the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.letsgo.com/12350-europe-travel-guides-the_netherlands-history-c |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822122321/http://www.letsgo.com/12350-europe-travel-guides-the_netherlands-history-c |archivedate=2011-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://soapbox.websitetoolbox.com/post?id=2019573 Charting Europe's Future in the 'Post Postwar' Era. - Soap Box Discussion Forums and Messageboard - Home of the Patrioteer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990s and the 21st century are rarely considered to be part of the post-war era.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8213">A '''proximate cause''' is an event which is ''closest'' to, or immediately responsible for [[causality|causing]], some observed result.  This exists in contrast to a higher-level '''ultimate cause''' (or ''distal cause'') which is usually thought of as the "real" reason something occurred.
* ''Example:'' Why did the ship sink?
** Proximate cause: Because it was holed beneath the waterline, water entered the hull and the ship became denser than the water which supported it, so it could not stay afloat.
** Ultimate cause: Because the ship hit a rock which tore open the hole in the ship's hull.

In most situations, an ultimate cause may itself be a proximate cause for a further ultimate cause.  Hence we can continue the above example as follows:

* ''Example:'' Why did the ship hit the rock?
** Proximate cause: Because the ship failed to change course to avoid it.
** Ultimate cause: Because the ship was under autopilot and the autopilot's data was inaccurate.
** (even stronger): Because the shipwrights made mistakes in the ship's construction.
** (stronger yet): Because the scheduling of labor at the shipyard allows for very little rest.
** (in absurdum): Because the shipyard's owners have very small profit margins in an ever-shrinking market.

Separating proximate from ultimate causation frequently leads to better understandings of the events and systems concerned.

==In ordinary affairs==
In ordinary affairs as well as in science, engineering, and other fields, all of the characteristics of an effect will be completely explained by the set of proximate causes. If a postulated (hypothesized) set of proximate causes (also known as "direct factors") does not fully explain all of the characteristics (attributes) of the effect, then the set of direct factors is either wrong or incomplete.

The set of direct factors (of an effect) has a number of known properties:

*Predisposing factors that set the stage for the effect and a precipitating factor that brought the effect into being. (The future recurrence of the effect may be precluded by negating certain predisposing factors and/or by negating the precipitating factor. For example, the detonation of a car bomb could be precluded by removing the bomb or by not turning the ignition key.)
*These factors may be considered to be predisposing factors: 
**The nature of the effect
**The magnitude (or intensity) of the effect
**The location of the effect
*May be considered to be precipitating:
**The timing of the effect. 
**The vulnerability for the effect
**the creation of the effect
**The factor(s) that made the effect as large [intense] as it was
**The factor(s) that kept the magnitude [intensity] from being even greater.

The set of direct factors will always include:

*Something that can be affected
*Something that can do the affecting
*The proximity of the foregoing
*The simultaneity of the first two
*The absence of  any intervening separation between the first two. (This is the paradigm of "barrier analysis.")

==In biology==
* '''Ultimate causation''' explains traits in terms of evolutionary forces acting on them.
:''Example:'' female animals often display preferences among male display traits, such as song.  An ultimate explanation based on [[sexual selection]] states that females who display preferences have more vigorous or more attractive male offspring.
* '''Proximate causation''' explains biological function in terms of immediate physiological or environmental factors.
:''Example:'' a female animal chooses to mate with a particular male  during a mate choice trial.   A possible proximate explanation states that one male produced a more intense signal, leading to elevated hormone levels in the female producing copulatory behaviour.

Although the behavior in these two examples is the same, the explanations are based on different sets of factors incorporating  evolutionary versus physiological factors.

These can be further divided, for example proximate causes may be given in terms of local muscle movements or in terms of [[developmental biology]] (see [[Tinbergen's four questions]]).

== In philosophy ==

In analytic philosophy, notions of cause adequacy are employed in the [[Causal model|causal mechanistic model of explanation]]. In order to explain the genuine cause of an effect, one would have to satisfy adequacy conditions, which include, among others, the ability to distinguish between:

1. Genuine causal relationships and accidents.

2. Causes and effects.

3. Causes and effects from a common cause.

One famous example of the importance of this is the [[Duhem–Quine thesis|Duhem-Quine Problem]], which demonstrates that it is impossible to test a [[scientific hypothesis]] in isolation, because an [[Empirical method|empirical]] test of the hypothesis requires one or more background assumptions. One way to solve this issue is to employ contrastive explanations. Several philosophers of science such as [[Peter Lipton|Lipton]] argue that contrastive explanations are able to detect genuine causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lipton|first=Peter|date=1990-01-01|title=Contrastive Explanation|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/LIPCE|journal=Royal Institute of Philosophy Supplement|volume=27|pages=247–266}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a contrastive explanation is a cohort study that includes a control group, where one can determine the cause from observing two otherwise identical samples. This view also circumvents the problem of infinite regression of 'why's that proximate causes create.

==In sociology==
Sociologists use the related pair of terms "proximal causation" and "distal causation."

'''Proximal causation''': explanation of human social behaviour by considering the immediate factors, such as [[symbolic interaction]], [[Verstehen|understanding (Verstehen)]], and individual milieu that influence that behaviour. Most sociologists recognize that proximal causality is the first type of [[Power (social and political)|power]] humans experience; however, while factors such as family relationships may initially be meaningful, they are not as permanent, underlying, or determining as other factors such as institutions and social networks (Naiman 2008: 5).

'''Distal causation''': explanation of human social behaviour by considering the larger context in which individuals carry out their actions. Proponents of the distal view of power argue that power operates at a more abstract level in the society as a whole (e.g. between economic classes) and that "all of us are affected by both types of power throughout our lives" (ibid). Thus, while individuals occupy [[role]]s and [[social status|statuses]] relative to each other, it is the social structure and institutions in which these exist that are the ultimate cause of behaviour. A human biography can only be told in relation to the social structure, yet it also must be told in relation to unique individual experiences in order to reveal a complete picture (Mills 1959).

==Definition==
The changing concept of family requires a subjective definition of what family entails. There is no contest that the relationship between husband and wife,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cvetic|first1=Goran|title=Immigration Cases in Strasbourg: The Right to Family Life Under Article 8 of the European Convention|journal=International and Comparative Law Quarterly|date=1987|volume=36|issue=3|page=650|doi=10.1093/iclqaj/36.3.647}}&lt;/ref&gt; unmarried (de facto) partners,&lt;ref&gt;''Johnston v Ireland'' (9697/82) ECHR 18 December 1986&lt;/ref&gt; parents and children,&lt;ref&gt;''Berrehab v the Netherlands'' (3/1987/126/177; 10730/84) ECHR 28 May 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; siblings,&lt;ref&gt;''Olsson v Sweden'' (10465/83) ECHR 24 March 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; and ‘near relatives’ such as between grandparents and grandchildren&lt;ref&gt;''Marckx v Belgium'' 2 EHRR 330.&lt;/ref&gt; represents family as required under the right to family life. Challenge exists where modern forms of family relationships have developed that the law has not yet explicitly recognised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Donnell|first1=Kath|title=The Unmarried Father and the Right to Family Life: ''Keegan v. Ireland''|journal=Maastricht Journal of European and Comparative Law|date=1995|volume=2|issue=1|page=85|doi=10.1177/1023263X9500200107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The “existence… of family life is a question of fact” and is decided subjectively under each factual scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Nadia|last1=Melehi |title=The right to family life free from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation: the European and Inter-American perspectives|date=2014|journal= American University International Law Review |volume=29|page= 954}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Court of Human Rights]] has stated that when considering what constitutes family relationships the Court “must necessarily take into account developments in society and changes in the perception of social, civil-status and relational issues, including the fact that there is not just one way or one choice in the sphere of leading and living one’s family or private life”.&lt;ref&gt;''Villianatos and Others v Greece'' (29381/09 &amp; 32684/09) [2013] ECHR (7 November 2013), at [84].&lt;/ref&gt; Established family ties can be broken.&lt;ref&gt;Ivana Roagna “Protecting the right to respect for private and family life under the European Convention on Human Rights” (2012) Council of Europe Human Rights Handbooks, at 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to the right to marry==
The right to marry is closely related to the right to family life, however the two rights are not identical. The right to marry is explicitly provided for in all human rights instruments,&lt;ref&gt;European Convention on Human Rights, Article 12; American Convention on Human Rights, Article 17; International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 23(1); African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights, Article 18; Universal Declaration on Human Rights, Article 16; European Social Charter, Article 16; International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 10.&lt;/ref&gt; essentially providing that all people have the right to marry and found a family. The right to family life predominantly refers to an individual's right to create and maintain their family relationships. It was clarified in ''X, Y and Z v United Kingdom'' that in the situation where a spouse has been deported from their partner's State due to their nationality, there is no infringement on the right to marry as the individuals are already married, and so the right to family life must be considered.&lt;ref&gt;''X, Y &amp; Z v United Kingdom'' (GC) 22 April 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
The main area of conflict arises between the ability of States to control entry and residence within its borders and the impact this control has over an individual’s right to family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burchill|first1=Richard|title=The Right to Live Wherever You Want? The Right to Family Life following the UN Human Rights Committee's Decision in ''Winata''|journal=Netherlands Quarterly of Human Rights|date=2003|volume=21|issue=2|doi=10.1177/016934410302100204|ref=harv|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[International Law|international law]] the general principle holds that a State has the right to regulate entry and residence within its own territory.&lt;ref&gt;''Chahal v United Kingdom'' (22414/93) [1996] ECHR 54 (15 November 1996), at [73].&lt;/ref&gt; When this power of control results in the deportation of an individual, this may cause a breach of an individual's right to stay with their family. This conflict occurs where the immigrant is the spouse, parent or relative of a State's citizen, and the State wishes to remove or refuse entry to the immigrant.&lt;ref&gt;Emmet Whelan “The right to family live v immigration control: the application of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights in Ireland” (2006) Hibernian Law Journal 6, at 93.&lt;/ref&gt; When a challenge is brought forward to the Courts or monitoring bodies, a balance must be struck between the rights of the State to enforce immigration laws and maintain public order, and the impact the enforcement of said laws will have on an individual's right to family life.{{sfn|Burchill|2003|p=234}} It has been emphasised that it is not the task of monitoring bodies to “supervise the government's immigration policy, but to examine whether the applicant’s right to respect for family life had been ensured without discrimination”.&lt;ref&gt;''Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v United Kingdom'' (1985) 7 EHRR 471.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International instruments==
Both Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 23 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provide basis for the right to family life as a fundamental human right.

===Universal Declaration of Human Rights===
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 10 December 1948, clarifying universal rights held by all individuals regardless of subjective factors.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Moeckli, Sangeeta Shah and Sandesh Sivakumaran International Human Rights Law (2nd ed, Oxford University Press, United Kingdom, 2014) at 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably the UDHR now represents customary international law, and as such has legally binding force over States.

The pertinent provision relating to the right to family lies in Article 16(3) of the UDHR:

{{Quote|text=3. The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.&lt;ref&gt;Universal Declaration on Human Rights, Article 16(3) accessed at &lt;http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights===
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on the 16 December 1966, and came into force on the 23 March 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Adam McBeth, Justine Nolan and Simon Rice The International Law of Human Rights (Oxford University Press, Australia, 2011) at 251.&lt;/ref&gt; As at May 2016 there are 168 State parties to the ICCPR, giving effect to the civil and political rights of individuals within their borders.&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, accessed at &lt; https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-4&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Articles 17 and 23(1) ICCPR refer to the right to family:

Article 17:
{{Quote|text=1.	No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.
2.	Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.}}

Article 23(1):
{{Quote|text=1. The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.}}

The Human Rights Committee has noted that the protection of the family and its members is also directly and indirectly guaranteed by other Articles within the Covenant in addition to Articles 17 and 23, such as protection of the child under Article 24.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Committee “General Comment No 19 of 1990, Article 23” (1994) UN Doc HRI/GEN/1/Rev.1 at 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Case Law====
''Winata v Australia'' &lt;ref&gt;''Winata v Australia'' Communication No. 930/2000 (16 August 2001) UN Doc. CCPR/C/72/D/930/2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

This case was based on applications made by Hendrick Winata and So Lan Li under Articles 17, 23(1) and 24(1) of the ICCPR alleging that the removal of Winata and Li from Australia, where their adolescent son held residency, would amount a violation of their fundamental human rights, specifically that of their right to family.{{sfn|Burchill|2003|p=227}} Both Winata and Li were living illegally in Australia, and were facing deportation by the State. It was claimed that through either the separation of Winata and Li from their son through deportation, or the forced removal of the whole family unit to Indonesia, there would be interference with the fundamental family unit that was not compatible with the State's protection obligations to the right to family under the ICCPR. Australia argued that the application was inadmissible and incompatible with the provisions of the ICCPR, emphasising the ICCPR provides protection “only [to] a right to family life, not a right to family life in a particular country.”{{sfn|Burchill|2003|p=229}} The majority view of the [[Human Rights Committee]] found in favour of Winata and Li, holding that while individuals may not have the right to decide where they reside, States are obligated to protect all of the rights within the ICCPR. The Committee recognised the importance of State's control over immigration within their territory, however this discretion is “not unlimited”.&lt;ref&gt;''Winata v Australia'' Communication No. 930/2000 (16 August 2001) UN Doc. CCPR/C/72/D/930/2000 at 7.3.&lt;/ref&gt; It was held that deportation of Winata and Li would constitute a violation of Article 17 and 23(1) ICCPR.

Prior to this case international practice indicated that it was for States to determine who could reside in their territory, even where an infringement of Article 23 would arguably occur.{{sfn|Burchill|2003|p=226}} The Committee’s decision in this instance challenges this assumption, indicating that an individual's right to family life receives precedence over States’ ability to control residence within their territory.

===International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights===
The [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR) was also adopted by the General Assembly on 16 December 1966, however it did not enter into force till nine years after it opened for signature on 3 January 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Adam McBeth, Justine Nolan and Simon Rice The International Law of Human Rights (Oxford University Press, Australia, 2011) at 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 10(1) provides for the right to family:

{{Quote|text=1. The widest possible protection and assistance should be accorded to the family, which is the natural and fundamental group unit of society, particularly for its establishment and while it is responsible for the care and education of dependant children.&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 10 accessed at &lt;http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Europe==
Within Europe the European Convention on Human Rights and the [[European Social Charter]] stand as foundational human rights instruments.

===European Convention on Human Rights===
Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) states:

{{Quote|text=1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.
2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.&lt;ref&gt;European Convention on Human Rights, Article 8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Article imposes both positive and negative obligations on States; not only is the State required to protect its constituents from arbitrary interference in family life by public authorities,&lt;ref&gt;''Belgian Linguistics case (No. 2)'' (1968) 1 EHRR 252, at 33[7].&lt;/ref&gt; it must also provide within its domestic legal system safeguards that allow the development of a “normal family life”.&lt;ref&gt;''Marckx v Belgium'' 2 EHRR. 330, at [31].&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that Article 8 applies to both “legitimate” and “illegitimate” family, with no distinction between the two qualifications within the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;''Marckx v Belgium'' 2 EHRR. 330, at [31].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Case Law====
''EM (Lebanon) (FC) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department''&lt;ref&gt;''EM (Lebanon) (FC) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department'' [2008] UKHL 64, [2008] 3 W.L.R. 931.&lt;/ref&gt;

This case involved a second appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State for the Home Department that EM and her son (AF) must return to Lebanon, the appellant’s country of origin. EM had fled from Lebanon with AF following a violent marriage and resulting divorce. Under Lebanese Shari’a law, the physical custody of the child must be transferred to the father or a male family member once the child reaches seven years of age. AF was over the age of seven, and so would have all custodial rights transferred to his paternal father upon return to Lebanon. EM argued that the forced removal to Lebanon by the United Kingdom would result in a direct breach of both her and AF’s right to family life under Article 8 of the ECHR. The Court held that removal of the appellant and her son to Lebanon would violate both EM and AF’s Article 8 rights, and granted the appeal. This decision is significant, representing the first successful Article 8 claim in a foreign case.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Palmer and A. T. H Smith “Protecting the Right to Respect for Family Life in “Foreign” Cases” (2009) The Cambridge Law Journal 68(3) at 498.&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Social Charter===
The European Social Charter (the Charter) is the counterpart to the European Convention on Human Rights, providing for fundamental social and economic rights under a [[Council of Europe]] treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe “The European Social Charter” (2016) accessed at &lt;http://www.coe.int/en/web/turin-european-social-charter&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Charter also provides for the right to family under Article 16, reaffirming European parties commitment to the right:

{{Quote|text=With a view to ensuring the necessary conditions for the full development of the family, which is a fundamental unit of society, the Contracting Parties undertake to promote the economic, legal and social protection of family life by such means as social and family benefits, fiscal arrangements, provision of family housing, benefits for the newly married, and other appropriate means.&lt;ref&gt;The European Social Charter, Article 16 accessed at &lt;https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168007cf93&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other international instruments==

===Americas===
The [[American Convention on Human Rights]] is a regional human rights treaty that similarly provides for the right to family life under Article 17(1):
{{Quote|text=1. The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the state.&lt;ref&gt;American Convention on Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Africa===
The protection of the family and vulnerable groups is specified under the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights in Article 18, stating:
{{Quote|text=1. The family shall be the natural unit and basis of society. It shall be protected by the State which shall take care of its physical health and moral.
2. The State shall have the duty to assist the family which is the custodian of morals and traditional values recognized by the community.}}

The African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights was adopted by the Organisation of African Unity in 1981 and entered into force on 21 October 1986.

===United Kingdom===
Within the United Kingdom the right to family life is a ‘qualified right’ under the Human Rights Act 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Citizens Advice “When can a public authority interfere with your human rights?” (2016) accessed at &lt;https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-rights/civil-rights/human-rights/when-can-a-public-authority-interfere-with-your-human-rights/&gt;; Human Rights Act (UK) 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; This qualification allows a public authority to interfere with the right to family life if it is in protection of others' rights or in the interest of the wider community. On 9 July 2012 new Immigration Rules came into effect within the United Kingdom, affording greater weight to the States' ability to control entry and residence as compared to the individual right to family life.&lt;ref&gt;The London School of Economics and Political Science “Deportation and the right to respect for private and family life under Article 8 HRA” February 2013, accessed from &lt; http://www.lse.ac.uk/humanRights/documents/2011/KlugDeportation.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a presumption that decisions made under the Immigration Rules will breach Article 8 of the ECHR only in “genuinely exceptional circumstances”.&lt;ref&gt;The London School of Economics and Political Science “Deportation and the right to respect for private and family life under Article 8 HRA” February 2013, accessed from &lt; http://www.lse.ac.uk/humanRights/documents/2011/KlugDeportation.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  This presumption significantly limits individual’s ability to successfully challenge decisions they believe have breached their fundamental right to family life.

'''Social defeat''' refers to losing a confrontation among [[Conspecificity|conspecific]] animals, or any kind of hostile dispute among [[humans]], in either a [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] or in a group-individual context, potentially generating very significant practical and [[psychological]] consequences in terms of control over resources, access to mates and social positions.

==Background==

Research on [[social stress]] has accumulated a useful body of knowledge, providing perspective on the effects of detrimental social and environmental interaction on the brain. Research and experimentation suffer from many methodological difficulties: usually a lack of ecological validity (similarity with natural conditions and stressors) or are not amenable to scientific investigation (difficult to test and verify).

Social psychology approaches to human [[aggression]] have developed a multitude of perspectives, based on observations of human phenomena like bullying, mobbing, physical and verbal abuse, relational and indirect aggression, etc. Despite the richness of theories developed, the body of knowledge generated has not satisfied scientific requirements of [[testability]] and [[falsifiability|verifiability]].

Animal studies of within-species aggression developed in 2 main branches: A) approaches based on laboratory experiments, on controlled conditions, allowing the measurement of behavioral, [[endocrine]] and [[neurological]] variables, but with the shortcoming of applying unnatural stressors (such as foot-shocks and restraint stress) in unnatural conditions (laboratory cages rarely approximate native habitats); B) approaches based on observations of animals in naturalistic settings, which avoided artificial environments and unnatural stresses, but usually not allowing the measurement of physiological effects or the manipulation of relevant variables.

In real life situations, animals (including humans) have to cope with [[Stress (biological)|stresses]] generated within their own species, during their interactions with conspecifics, especially due to recurrent struggles over the control of limited resources, mates and [[Social hierarchy|social positions]] (Bjorkqvist, 2001; Rohde, 2001; Allen &amp; Badcock, 2003).

Social defeat is a source of chronic [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] in animals and humans, capable of causing significant changes in behaviour, [[brain]] functioning, [[physiology]], [[neurotransmitter]] and [[hormone]] levels, and [[health]] (Bjorkqvist, 2001; Rohde, 2001; Allen &amp; Badcock, 2003).

==History==
The social defeat approach was originated from animal experiments, using the "resident-intruder" [[paradigm]], in which an animal was placed in the cage of another animal or group of animals of the same species, in a manner that allowed a non-lethal conflict.

If animals are allowed to fight on a single occasion only, it is usually regarded as a model of acute stress; if they are allowed to fight on several different occasions, on different days, consecutive or not, it is regarded as a model of chronic stress. 
After the defeat or in the interval between fights, the subordinate animal may also be exposed to threats from the dominant one, by having to stay in a cage or compartment beside or nearby the dominant, exposed to its visual or olfactory cues.

Later, the social defeat approach was also applied to observations of animal within-species aggression, in the wild, which suggested that the hypotheses generated on artificial laboratory settings can also be applied in observed in natural settings, confirming the predictions of the model.

==In humans==
It has been proposed that animal models of social conflict may be useful for studying a number of [[mental disorders]], including [[major depression]], [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[drug abuse]], aggressive psychopathologies, [[eating disorders]] and [[schizophrenia]] (Bjorkqvist, 2001; Selten &amp; Cantor-Graae, 2005; Rohde, 2001).

The social defeat model has been extended to include observations of human [[aggression]], [[bullying]], [[relational aggression]], chronic subordination and [[humiliation]].  The social defeat model attempts to extend animal studies to include human behaviour as well, in contrast to the [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]] study of aggression, in which comparisons are drawn exclusively from experiments involving humans (Bjorkqvist, 2001; Rohde, 2001).

Bullying has interesting parallels with animal models of social defeat, the bully being equivalent to the dominant animal and the victim the subordinate one. At stake are possessions of material objects, money, etc., social position in the group, represented by in-group prestige, and the consequent lack of access to mates, including for socio-sexual behaviors like copulation. Human victims typically experience symptoms like low self-esteem (due to low regard by the group), feelings of depression (due to unworthiness of efforts), social withdrawal (reduced investments in the social environment), anxiety (due to a threatening environment), and they can also be shown to experience a plethora of physiological effects, e.g. increased corticosterone levels, and also a shift towards sympathetic balance in the autonomic nervous system (Bjorkqvist, 2001).

Research about human aggression, usually conducted by psychologists or social psychologists, resembles to a great extent the research about social defeat and animal aggression, usually conducted by biologists or physiological psychologists. However, there is the problem of the use of different terminologies for similar concepts, which hinders communication between the two bodies of knowledge (Bjorkqvist, 2001).

Similarly, research on depression has employed similar constructs, such as [[learned helplessness]], although that theory is focused on the perceived inability to escape any sort of negative stimuli rather than on social factors.

===Behavioral and physiological effects===
Social defeat is a very potent [[Stress (medicine)|stressor]] and can lead to a variety of behavioral effects, like social withdrawal (reduced interactions with conspecifics), lethargy (reduced locomotor activity), reduced exploratory behavior (of both open field and novel objects), anhedonia (reduced reward-related behaviors), decreased socio-sexual behaviors (including decreased attempts to mate and copulate after defeat), various motivational deficits, decreased levels of testosterone (due to a decline in the functionality of the Leydig cells of the testes), increased tendencies to stereotyped behaviours and [[Self medication|self-administration of drugs and alcohol]] (Rygula et alli, 2005; Huhman, 2006).

Research also implicates that the referred behavioral effects are moderated by neuroendocrine phenomena involving [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]], and in the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]], [[locus ceruleus]] and [[limbic system]]s (Bjorkqvist, 2001; Rygula et alli, 2005; Selten &amp; Cantor-Graae, 2005; Marinia et alli, 2006; Huhman, 2006).

Both animal and human studies suggest that the social environment has a strong influence on the consequences of stresses. This finding seems to be especially true in the case of social stresses, like social defeat (Bjorkqvist, 2001; Rygula et alli, 2005; de Jong et alli, 2005).

In animal studies, animals housed collectively showed reduced symptoms after defeat, in comparison with those housed alone; and animals that live in more stable groups (with stable hierarchies, less intra-group aggression) exhibit reduced effects after a defeat, in comparison with those housed in a more unstable group (de Jong et alli, 2005). In separate studies, defeat behaviors can be modulated by acetylcholine (Smith et al., 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=RS|last2=Hu|first2=R|last3=DeSouza|first3=A|last4=Eberly|first4=CL|last5=Krahe|first5=K|last6=Chan|first6=W|last7=Araneda|first7=RC|title=Differential Muscarinic Modulation in the Olfactory Bulb.|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=29 July 2015|volume=35|issue=30|pages=10773–85|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0099-15.2015|pmid=26224860|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/35/30/10773.long|accessdate=6 August 2015|pmc=4518052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In human studies, individuals with greater [[Social support|support]] seem to be protected against excessive neuroendocrine activation, thereby reducing the adverse effects of stresses in general, and especially stresses of social origin. 
  
This apparent confusion, in which social defeat generates behavioral and neuroendocrine effects, both of which depending on social contextual variables, raises the question of how to interpret this data. A useful concept is the concept of “causal chain”, in which recurrent evolutionary events, in this case intra-specific competition, generates [[Evolutionary pressure|selective pressures]] that last for thousands of generations, influencing a whole species. This way physiological phenomena may evolve, in this case the referred neuro-endocrine phenomena, to facilitate adaptive patterns of action by individuals, in this case the referred behavioral effects. According to this framework, selective pressures generated by intra-specific competition can be considered as the ultimate cause, the neuroendocrine phenomena can be considered to be the proximate causes (sometimes also called mechanisms or moderators) and the observed behavioral alterations are considered the effects (the end events in the causal chain)(Gilbert et alli, 2002; Allen &amp; Badcock, 2003; Rygula et alli, 2005).

Some authors, for example [[Randolph Nesse]], warn us that patterns of behavior commonly considered inappropriate or even pathological may well have adaptive value. According to this view, several authors propose that behaviors considered abnormal may be in fact part of an adaptive response to stressors in modern or at least in old environments, for example social stressors from chronic subordination or interpersonal conflicts (Gilbert et alli, 2002; Allen &amp; Badcock, 2003). [[Evolutionary psychology]] provides several possible explanations for why humans typically respond to social dynamics in the way that they do, including possible functions of [[self-esteem]] in relation to [[dominance hierarchy|dominance hierarchies]].

'''Social determinism''' is the theory that social interactions and constructs alone determine individual behavior (as opposed to biological or objective factors).

Consider certain [[human behavior]]s, such as committing murder, or writing poetry.  A social determinist would look only at social phenomena, such as customs and expectations, education, and interpersonal interactions, to decide whether or not a given person would exhibit any of these behaviors. They would discount biological and other non-social factors, such as [[Genetics|genetic]] makeup, the physical environment, etc. Ideas about nature and biology would be considered to be [[Social construction|socially constructed]].

== Social determinism and ideology ==
The socially determined actions of an individual can be influenced by forces that control the flow of ideas. By creating an [[ideology]] within the society of the individual, the individual's actions and reactions to [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] are predetermined to adhere to the [[social rules]] imposed on him/her. Ideologies can be created using social institutions such as schooling, which "have become the terrain upon which contending forces express their social and political interest" (Mayberry 3), or the mass media, which has "significant power in shaping the social agenda and framing of public opinion to support that agenda" (Colaguori 35).

By creating a social construction of reality, these forces directly create a [[hegemonic]] control over the future of individuals who feel like the social construct is natural and therefore unchangeable. Their actions become based in the context of their society so that, even if they possess an innate talent for a sport, if the social construction implies that their race is unathletic in general, or their nation or state does not produce athletes, they do not include the possibility of athleticism in their future. Their society has successfully determined their actions.

Social determinism can favor a political party's agenda by setting social rules so that the individual considers the party's agenda to be morally correct, an example being the 2010 G20 summit riots in Toronto. The media, controlled by corporations and the governments with agendas of their own, publicizes the riots as violent and dangerous, but the goal of the rioters, to rebel against those whose position in power enables them to abuse the system for personal gain, is lost because the focus is on the violence. The individuals' view on the subject are then directly influenced by the media and their reactions are predetermined by that social form of control. "We have been taught to think that censorship is the main mechanism of how the media uses information as a form of social control, but in fact what ''is'' said, and how it is ''selectively presented'', is a far more powerful form of information control." (Colaguori 35).

Social determinism was first studied by [[Emile Durkheim]] (1858 - 1917), French philosopher considered as the father of the social science.

== Social determinism ==
Social determinism is most commonly understood in opposition to [[biological determinism]]. Within the [[media studies]] discipline, however, social determinism is understood as the counterpart of technological determinism.
[[Technological determinism]] is the notion that technological change and development is inevitable, and that the characteristics of any given technology determine the way it is used by the society in which it is developed. The concept of technological determinism is dependent upon the premise that social changes come about as a result of the new capabilities that new technologies enable.

The notion of social determinism opposes this perspective. Social determinism perceives technology as a result of the society in which it is developed. A number of contemporary media theorists have provided persuasive accounts of social determinism, including Leila Green.

In her book ''Technoculture'' Leila Green examines in detail the workings of a social determinist perspective, and argues “social processes determine technology for social purposes”. {{Harv|Green|2001}} She claims that every technological development throughout history was born of a social need, be this need economical, political or military. {{Harv|Green|2001}}

According to Green, technology is always developed with a particular purpose or objective in mind. As the development of technology is necessarily facilitated by financial funding, a social determinist perspective recognizes that technology is always developed to benefit those who are capable of funding its development.

Thus social determinists perceive that technological development is not only determined by the society in which it occurs, but that it is inevitably shaped by the power structures that exist in that society. {{Harv|Green|2001}}

==Arguments against social determinism==
{{Original research|date=December 2017}}
Scientific studies have shown that [[social behavior]] is partly inherited and can influence infants and also even influence foetuses. Wired to be social means that infants are not taught that they are social beings, but they are born as prepared social beings. The infants are born with an inherited social skill.

Social pre-wiring deals with the study of fetal social behavior and social interactions in a multi-fetal environment. Specifically, social pre-wiring refers to the [[ontogeny]] of [[social relation|social interaction]]. Also informally referred to as, "wired to be social." The theory questions whether there is a propensity to [[social actions|socially oriented action]] already present ''before'' birth. Research in the theory concludes that newborns are born into the world with a unique [[genetics|genetic]] wiring to be social.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951360/ Umberto Castiello, et al: National Institutes of Health&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumstantial evidence supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, have been found to display a preparedness for [[social relation|social interaction]]. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of [[socialization]] or [[social construction]]. Rather, newborns most likely [[heredity|inherit]] to some extent [[social behavior]] and [[identity (social science)|identity]] through [[genetics]].&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

Principal evidence of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are [[social behavior]]s that are [[heredity|inherited]] and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage in some form of [[social relation|social interaction]] before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed over a period of time using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

The social pre-wiring hypothesis was proved correct, "The central advance of this study is the demonstration that '[[social actions]]' are already performed in the second trimester of [[gestational age|gestation]]. Starting from the 14th week of [[gestational age|gestation]] twin foetuses plan and execute movements specifically aimed at the co-twin. These findings force us to predate the emergence of [[social behavior]]: when the context enables it, as in the case of twin foetuses, other-directed actions are not only possible but predominant over self-directed actions.".&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

{{History of the Jews in England}}
The '''Statute of the Jewry''' was a [[statute]] issued by [[Edward I of England]] in 1275. It placed a number of restrictions on [[Jews]] of [[England]], most notably outlawing the practice of [[usury]].&lt;ref name="Prestwich"&gt;Prestwich, Michael. Edward I p 345 (1997) Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-07157-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Since the time of the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]], Jews had been filling a small but vital role in the English economy. Usury by [[Christian]]s was banned by the [[Catholic Church]] at the time, but Jews were permitted to act as [[moneylenders]] and bankers. That position enabled some Jews to amass tremendous wealth, but also earned them the enmity of the English populace,&lt;ref&gt; Rubenstein, W.D. A History of the Jews p 36 (1996) Macmillan Press. {{ISBN|0-333-55833-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which added to the increasing [[antisemitic]] sentiments of the time, due to widespread indebtedness and financial ruin among the [[gentile]] population.

When Edward returned from the [[Crusades]] in 1274, two years after his accession as [[King of England]], he found that land had become a commodity, and that many of his subjects had become dispossessed and were in danger of destitution. Jews traded land for money, and land was often mortgaged to Jewish moneylenders.

As special direct subjects of the [[King of England|monarch]], Jews could be taxed indiscriminately by the King. Some have described the situation as indirect usury: the monarch permitting and encouraging Jews to practise usury and then taxing the profit. In the years leading up to the Statute, Edward taxed them heavily to help finance his forthcoming military campaigns in [[Wales]], which commenced in 1277. One theory{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} holds that he had exhausted the financial resources of the Jewish community when the Statute was passed in 1275.&lt;ref name="Prestwich" /&gt;

==Provisions==
* Usury was outlawed in every form.
* Debtors of Jews were no longer liable for certain debts.
* Jews were not allowed to live outside certain cities and towns.
* Any Jew above the age of seven had to wear a [[yellow badge]] of felt on his or her outer clothing, six inches by three inches.
* All Jews from the age of 12 on had to pay a special tax of three pence annually.
* Christians were forbidden to live among Jews.
* Jews were licensed to buy farmland to make their living for the next 15 years.
* Jews could thenceforth make a living in England only as merchants, farmers, craftsmen or soldiers.

The licence to buy land was included so that farming, along with trading, could give Jews an opportunity to earn a living with the abolition of usury. Unfortunately, other provisions along with widespread prejudice made this difficult for many.&lt;ref&gt; Glassman, David. Anti-Semitic Stereotypes p 17 (1975) Wayne State University Press. {{ISBN|0-8143-1545-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After fifteen years had passed, it was discovered that Jews widely but secretly continued to practise usury, leading Edward I to issue the [[Edict of Expulsion]] in 1290.&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, James. The Jew in the Medieval Community p 394 (1976) Hermon Press. {{ISBN|0-87203-059-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Strengths and weaknesses''' generally refer to a person's [[character structure|character]].

Often a [[Virtue|strength]] can be a [[Vice|weakness]], and vice versa, a weakness can be a strength. In [[Chinese philosophy]], [[yin yang|yin and yang]] (e.g., dark and light) are described as complementary opposites within a greater whole. 

For example, here are some opportunity and weaknesses by [[personality type]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterursbender.com/quiz/swtable.html Peter Urs Bender's Guide to Strengths and Weaknesses of Personality Types]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brinkman, Rick, and Rick Kirschner (2002).

A '''subpersonality''' is, in [[transpersonal psychology]], a [[personality mode]] that kicks in (appears on a temporary basis) to allow a person to cope with certain types of [[psychosocial]] situations.&lt;ref name="Fall"&gt;Fall, Kevin A. (December 9, 2003) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=pKFZKRG-IKwC&amp;pg=PA444&amp;dq=Subpersonality&amp;sig=lN_rPbMLbnsmLDNg8CeOAmiFD0M#PPA444,M1 Theoretical Models of Counseling and Psychotherapy.]'' Page 444.

''[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-171440400.html Coming to terms with past life regression.] Volume 22; Issue 6; Page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; the mode may include thoughts, feelings, actions, physiology and other elements of human behavior to [[Impression management|self-present]] a particular mode that works to negate particular psychosocial situations.&lt;ref name="Fall"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rowan&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowan|first=J|title=Subpersonalities: The People Inside Us|year=1990|publisher=Routlege|isbn=9780415043298}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average person has about a dozen subpersonalities.&lt;ref name="Fall"/&gt;

Subpersonalities are able to perceive [[consciousness]] as something separate from themselves, as well as domestic image attached to these elements.&lt;ref name="Fall"/&gt; [[United States|American]] transpersonal philosopher [[Ken Wilber]] identifies subpersonality as "functional self-presentations that navigate particular psychosocial situations."&lt;ref name="Fall"/&gt; For example, if a harsh critic responds with judgmental thoughts, anger, superior feelings, critical words, punitive action, and/or tense physiology when confronted with her own and/or others' fallibility, that is a subpersonality of the harsh critic kicking in to cope with the confrontation situation.&lt;ref name="Fall"/&gt;

==Subpersonalities in Psychotherapy==

For a somewhat different viewpoint: Many schools of [[psychotherapy]] see '''subpersonalities''' as relatively enduring psychological structures or entities that influence how a person feels, perceives, behaves, and sees him- or herself. Over the history of psychotherapy, many forms of therapy have worked with inner diversity representations or subpersonalities.&lt;ref name="FirmanGila2002-p69"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Firman|author2=Ann Gila|title=Psychosynthesis: A Psychology of the Spirit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVPLYPfAjksC&amp;pg=PA69|date=26 September 2002|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-5534-0|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DohertyGuyler2008-p88"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nora Doherty|author2=Marcelas Guyler|title=The Essential Guide to Workplace Mediation &amp; Conflict Resolution: Rebuilding Working Relationships|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DPMgUNyO6iMC&amp;pg=PA88|year=2008|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|isbn=978-0-7494-5019-9|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early methods were [[Jungian analysis]], [[Psychosynthesis]], [[Transactional Analysis|Transactional analysis]], and [[Gestalt therapy]]. These were followed by some forms of [[hypnotherapy]] and the [[inner child]] work of [[John Bradshaw (author)|John Bradshaw]] and others.

{{Very long|date=January 2015}}

Detailed [[Anthropology|anthropological]] and [[sociology|sociological]] studies have been made about customs of [[patrilineal]] inheritance, where only male children can inherit. Some cultures also employ [[matrilineal]] succession, where property can only pass along the female line, most commonly going to the sister's sons of the decedent; but also, in some societies, from the mother to her daughters. Some ancient societies and most modern states employ [[egalitarian inheritance]], without discrimination based on gender and/or birth order.

== Africa ==

=== Southern Africa ===

The system of patrilineal primogeniture traditionally prevalent among most southern Bantu tribes is explained in detail by Isabel Moodley: "Due to the polygynous nature of the customary marriage, African customary law distinguishes between "family rank" and "house rank". ... Family rank refers to the status of family members within the family group. In customary law, males held a higher rank than their female counterparts. A person's rank was ultimately determined by the principle of primogeniture. On the basis of that principle, oldest sons always had a higher rank than younger brothers and all sisters. That meant that females were always subjected to the authority of males and males alone were allowed to become family heads. In the extended family group however, the rank of a child was determined by the rank of their father within his family of origin. So, for example, if the father was the first born son in his family group that would mean that his children would hold a higher rank than any of the other children born of his siblings. ... House rank simply refers to the hierarchy of the various houses that constitute a family group. In a polygynous marriage, each marriage creates a separate family or household with the husband as the common spouse to all the families. Each household or separate family has a particular rank. ... Amongst the indigenous African peoples, the wife married first is known as the "main wife" or the "great wife". The rank of the children born in a specific household is thus solely dependent upon the rank of their mother's house or house rank. In other words, the rank of the children born to the main or great wife (irrespective of age) will be higher than the rank of all the other children born to the ancillary wives.

As Hoernlé states, "Among the children a strict hierarchy prevails, based on the seniority which serves as a fundamental principle of behaviour in Bantu society. The elder brother always takes precedence between brothers, and so, too, between sisters the privilege of age is maintained. Between brothers and sisters the sex differentiation often dominates the behaviour. Sisterhood and brotherhood most often overrule age differences, and there is a prescribed type of behaviour for a brother towards his sister and vice versa. Outside this intimate circle of the immediate family, the same principles of kinship and seniority hold sway. The father forms one of a close-knit group with his brothers. The latter are everywhere grouped under a kinship term which we may translate "father"; and these "fathers" are distinguished as "great" or "little" fathers, according as they are older or younger than the child's own father".&lt;ref&gt;A. WInifred Hoernlé, "Social Organisation" in I. Schapera (ed.), The Bantu-speaking Tribes of South Africa (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1937), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Van Warmelo writes, "Bantu social structure knows no equals, as with whole sibs, so with individuals.

Isaac Schapera writes about the [[Southern Bantu]] in general in "The Bantu Speaking Tribes of South Africa": "Polygyny is practised; but, except in the case of Chiefs and other prominent or wealthy men, not to any marked extent. Among the Shangana-Tonga, Venda, and Tswana the first wife married is normally the great wife, the rest ranking as minor wives in order of marriage. The Nguni, however, also give special rank to a second wife (the "right-hand wife"), and in some cases (e.g. Natal tribes) to a third wife (the "left-hand wife"). Any other wives are attached in a subordinate capacity to one or other of these principal houses. The Southern and Northern Sotho have adopted a somewhat similar system of domestic organization. The great wife takes the lead in all domestic affairs and, as already mentioned, her eldest son is heir to the general household property and to the status of his father."&lt;ref&gt;"The Bantu Speaking Tribes of South Africa https://archive.org/stream/bantuspeakingtri032916mbp/bantuspeakingtri032916mbp_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt; He writes specifically about the [[Tswana people|Tswana]]: "When a married man dies, leaving a wife and children of both sexes, his eldest son becomes the principal heir even if there is an older daughter. If this son has been formally disowned by his father, he cannot after the latter's death claim the estate. The rightful heir will be the oldest of the remaining sons. If the principal heir is dead, his eldest son will succeed to his rights, taking precedence over his father's younger brothers, along the lines already described in regard to the rules of succession."&lt;ref name="books.google.es"/&gt; "The estate of a polygamist is similarly divided. The eldest son in each house inherits all livestock assigned to that house. The eldest son of the great house further inherits such property as has not been assigned to any house". The only land that the Tswana use for agriculture are some fields that are assigned to each wife. Regarding their rules of inheritance, "The general rule, in practice, seems to be that the fields are inherited by those children who have not yet obtained any of their own, the youngest child having the first claim. If provision has already been made for all the children, the eldest son inherits all the fields, but can, and usually does, distribute some of them among his younger brothers and sisters". "(There are) three separate classes, nobles, commoners, ... and immigrants, ... Within each class there are further distinctions. Among nobles, the more closely a man is related to the chief, the higher does he rank. ... Among commoners ... the head of any group is senior to all his dependents, among whom his own relatives are of higher status than the others." "The children of paternal uncles are differentiated according to the relative status of their father. ... If senior to one's father by birth, they are entitled to obedience and respect; if junior, their services can be freely commanded. The saying that a man's elder brother is his chief, and his younger brother his subject, summarises adequately the accepted relation. ..."&lt;ref&gt;I. Schapera, The Tswana (London: International African Institute, 1953), pp. 36-37, and "Kinship and Politics in Tswana History," Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, 93 (December, 1963), pp. 159-17.3.&lt;/ref&gt; "Seniority is determined firstly by priority of birth. An
eldest son is always senior to the second, who in turn is senior to the third son and so on."
(Schapera, 1994:53-54)

Simon Roberts and Michael Palmer made a description of the Kgatla society, a sub-group of the Tswana people, in their book "Dispute Processes: ADR and the Primary Forms of Decision-Making", where they notice the conical (or pyramidal, as they say) shape of Tswana societies: "The link between the chief and the senior man in each ward is ideally a genealogical one, for the office of chief should devolve from father to eldest son, while the younger sons of each ruler go off to form their own wards, assuming administrative control of these new subdivisions of the main group. The Kgatla believe that their society was founded by Kgafela in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century, and most of the forty-eight wards in the central village of Mochuli today are headed by men claiming descent from younger brothers of chiefs descended from Kgafela. ... ward heads are senior members of the junior branches of the chief's lineage. This system of administration is reflected at ground level in the residential organization of the main village. At the centre is a group of homesteads occupied by men of the chief's immediate agnatic segment, and ranged around this are forty seven other groups of homesteads, each presided over by a ward head. ...  Within each ward ... the majority of the members again claim to be related in the male line to the headman. ... All the males claiming descent from a common grandfather tend to be grouped together, and within such a sub-group a minimal unit is made up of an adult married male, occupying a homestead with his wife (or wives) and children. ... Thus if the group is looked from the bottom up there is first the married male heading his own household, then the group consisting of his closest male agnates, then an aggregate of such groups forming a ward, and lastly the wards together forming the total society. ... Kgatla society can thus be seen as an ever growing and deepening pyramid, the base of which is extended as more males are born and rear their own families; while in its simplest form the political and administrative organization is imposed on the lineage system like a cloak."

The Zulus also practiced patrilineal primogeniture, allowing only minimal grants of land to younger sons. D.H. Reader writes in "Zulu Tribe in Transition: The Makhanya of southern Natal": "Within a given descent group, dominant or not in the sub-ward, the senior agnate will sometimes make known to his sons before he dies the land which he wishes them to have when they marry. If he has done so, it is the duty of the eldest son of the Great House (the general heir) to see that the others receive their allotted land when they marry after their father's death. Like the chief on a smaller scale, he holds the land in trust for them. ... In general, the chief will support a father during his lifetime in the matter of land apportionment, provided an adequate grant of land has been made to the eldest son and a minimal grant to any other sons. These grants naturally depend on the amount of land which the father has available, if any. If there is sufficient land, a minimal grant consists of a garden of at least half an acre, a big field of about two acres, and space to build upon; for under the present conditions of subsistence a man cannot live on less."&lt;ref&gt;Zulu Tribe in Transition: The Makhanya of Southern Natal Written By D. H Reader https://books.google.com/books?id=xcZRAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA65&lt;/ref&gt; In cases of polygamy, "The eldest son of the indlunkulu, to the exclusion of all others, succeeds to the property and status of the kraal head. Should he be dead, his eldest son will succeed. Failing such eldest son and all male lineal descendants through him, the second son of the indlunkulu succeeds and failing him his male lineal descendants in due order of seniority. Failing a third and all other sons of the indlunkulu and all male lineal descendants there, the succession will devolve upon the eldest son of the house first affiliated to the indlunkulu. Failing all heirs of this house the succession devolves upon the next affiliated house and so an according to the order of affiliation. Failing an heir in the indlunkulu or affiliated houses recourse will be had to the chief house on the Qadi side (second chief wife in a kraal, failing which, to the affiliate houses in order of their affiliation to the qadi house. Only in the event of a failure in all these houses will the succession devolve upon the eldest son of the chief khohlwa (wife of the left hand side or second in the order of marriage) in succession" (Krige, 1950: 180). The eldest son of each wife inherited the property assigned to his mother's house.&lt;ref&gt;The 'House' and Zulu Political Structure in the Nineteenth Century Adam Kuper Brunel University http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2821004&lt;/ref&gt; According to Comaroff, "a man's eldest son normally succeeds him as head of his household and to any political office that he may have held, and also inherits the great bulk of his cattle and such other property. The younger sons are likewise given a few cattle each. The widow and daughters received no cattle at all" (Comaroff, 1953:42 ). Livestock was so important among the southern Bantu that a Zulu would sometimes compare the structure of his homestead with the body of a cow. Cook claims that a Zulu informant "drew with his finger an incomplete oval in the sand, which stood for the trunk of a cow. Above, at the neck, he indicated the place of the homestead head. At breast height he indicated with his finger the uyise wabantu. At shoulder height, on the right side, he placed the heir, and on the right flank the junior right hand son. The left hand and junior left hand sons were indicated on the left shoulder and flank. According to them the homestead thus presents itself, structurally, like a cow." (1940: 69; cf. Cook 1931: 26)

However, every man has indisputable rights to the land he occupies and uses. His sons are entitled to the use of his land but may also ask the local headman to allocate fresh portions of land. Movable property—livestock, household utensils, and the proceeds of agriculture and trade—passes to the oldest son or, in the case of a polygynous marriage, the oldest son of the senior wife. This son becomes the undisputed head of the family unless he has disgraced himself in the eyes of the family, in which case the son next in line is appointed by the deceased's oldest sister with the consent of his brothers."&lt;ref name="dice.missouri.edu" /&gt; Among the [[Tsonga people|Tsonga]]: "Women do not inherit.

In terms of Swazi customary law there is only one heir who succeeds to the whole estate of the deceased and such person is chosen by
lusendvo. Where the deceased headman had one wife, his eldest son, in the absence of factors which may disqualify him becomes heir. This therefore means that his siblings will not inherit but only benefit from the estate through their brother. This preference of the eldest son over his siblings and mother goes against the dictates of the Constitution which provides for equal treatment and non-discrimination of women. If the deceased dies having married to two or more wives, the lusendvo will choose the principal wife and the oldest son of that wife or house will become the main heir".&lt;ref&gt;Phakama Shili "Social Inequalities: Inheritance Under Swazi Customary Law" https://www.academia.edu/3622608/Societal_Inequalities_Inheritance_under_Swazi_Customary_Law&lt;/ref&gt;

Customs of male primogeniture also prevailed among the [[Sotho people|Sotho]]. Among the [[Sotho people|Sotho]], "The heir under custom is the first male person born of that family. He takes over the administration of the estate upon death of the head of the family. This is provided for under Article 11 of the Laws of Lerotholi. The heir under custom should inherit (assuming use of the land after death of his father) the land together with obligations attached to that land."&lt;ref&gt;BASELINE RESEARCH ON CULTURAL PRACTICES RELATED TO LAND TENURE SECURITY AND INHERITANCE RIGHTS FOR LESOTHO WIDOWS AND ORPHANS AND VULNERABLE CHILDREN FUNDED BY: CIDA VOLUNTARY SECTOR FUND PREPARED BY: HABITAT FOR HUMANITY LESOTHO AND FEDERATION OF WOMEN LAWYERS (FIDA-LESOTHO) JUNE 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Kuper says about all the [[Sotho people|Sotho]] peoples: "The basic principle is that siblings of the same sex are regarded as similar, but are ranked; while siblings of opposite sex are different and equal. ...

=== West Africa ===

The [[Hausa people|Hausa]] didn't have the conical clan as their system of social organization (in Africa, this system predominated mostly among southern African peoples), but had a complex system of hereditary [[social stratification]] as well. The following excerpt is from Frank A. Salamone's "The Hausa of Nigeria":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Hausa tend to rank all specialties in a hierarchical and hereditary system. Inheritance is by primogeniture. The Hausa prize wealth and use it to form patronage links. However, wealth also brings with it the burden of great responsibilities. The patron-client relationship binds all Hausa men to some extent. The Maguzawa are organized into small villages of exogamous patrilineal kin. Conversely, Muslim Hausa local organization is somewhat more complex. The compound, his wife or wives, and their children is the smallest social unit. Other family members, clients, and their families may also inhabit the compound. Therefore, patrilocal extended families or joint fraternal families often inhabit a compound. The mai-gida, or male head of the family, rules the compound. The compound forms a joint agricultural unit. Occupational specialties, however, are at the discretion of the individual. As Muslims, each Hausa male may have four wives and as many concubines as he can support. ... In conformity with the Muslim Hausa principle of hierarchy, wives are ranked in the order of their marriages. The Hausa prefer cousin marriage on either side, although patrilateral parallel cousin marriage in the Fulani style has greater prestige than any other form of marriage. ... The Hausa pride themselves on being a "civilized" people with strong urban roots. They display a genius for organization. Their wards have a village organization, which is under the leadership of the village head. Formerly, there would be a titled official in the capital who held clusters of villages in fief.  The emir would be the overall ruler of the particular state, which consisted of a number of clusters of villages. British rule which was consolidated about the beginning of the Twentieth century changed the system in a number of ways, providing greater power to emirs and local Muslim officials."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank A.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eleanor C. Swanson and Robert O. Lagace write:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Muslim Hausa social organization is characterized by a complex system of stratification, based on occupation, wealth, birth, and patron-client ties. Occupational specialties are ranked and tend to be hereditary, to the extent that the first son is expected to follow his father's occupation. Wealth gives its possessor a certain amount of prestige and power, especially in forming ties of patronage. One's status is also determined by the status of one's family. Finally, all Hausa men are caught up in a network of patron-client ties that permeates the society. Patron-client ties are used as means of access to favors and power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/EthnoAtlas/Hmar/Cult_dir/Culture.7844 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217193539/http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/EthnoAtlas/Hmar/Cult_dir/Culture.7844 |archivedate=2010-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

M.G. Smith also discussed thoroughly the Hausa system of social status in his work "The Hausa system of social status."&lt;ref&gt;The Hausa System of Social Status M. G.

The lowest-ranking wife is the last-married wife or amariya and is the least respected wife and the one with least authority.

Kent M. Elbow described the socioeconomic system of Hausa farm villages extensively in 1994.&lt;ref name="ageconsearch.umn.edu"/&gt; He wrote about the Gandu:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Gandu refers to the set of relations that collectively define the basic production unit in traditional Hausaland. Most often these relations express themselves among the members of the gida, the basic household unit of rural Hausaland. The gida corresponds roughly to the common understanding of the extended family. Thus the nucleus of a gandu is an extended family, but accounts such as the classic Baba of Karo (M. Smith 1954) make it clear that the nineteenth century gandu also included slaves and descendants of slaves. Sutter's (1982) review of the literature points out that some writers stress the gandu's importance as a hedge against famine and food insecurity, while other writers emphasize its role as a defense against the slave-raiding parties prevalent during the pre-colonial era—and especially menacing in the nineteenth century under the Sokoto caliphate. Ega (1980) suggests that the traditional gandu probably consisted mostly of slaves, but stresses that the gandu was a work unit in which the owner and the slaves had mutual obligations. The owner had the right to a certain number of hours of labor from his slaves each day, and in return he was expected to provide them with land and the time to cultivate it. The slaves had full rights over the product of their "private" plots. It is thought that the elaborate and detailed mutual rights and duties between the gandu head and his younger brothers and sons—such as those enumerated by Hill (1970)—have evolved from the traditional mutual duties characteristic of master/slave relationships in the nineteenth century. For example, in most gandu arrangements the father assumes the responsibility of paying the taxes charged to his sons and may even be obligated to pay his sons' brideprice".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"The gandu system dictates that holdings are inherited in their entirety by the eldest son who will assume the role as gandu head",&lt;ref name="ageconsearch.umn.edu"&gt;Popular Participation in the Management of Natural Resources: Lessons from Baban Rafi, Niger by Kent M. Elbow http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/12748/1/rp940118.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; also wrote Kent M. Elbow. He argued that the gandu system had been on the decline for many years, and most scholars agree with this opinion.&lt;ref name="ageconsearch.umn.edu"/&gt; However, Poly Hill, researching a Hausa village in 1973, found that eldest sons or elder sons were still favored over younger sons in matters of land inheritance at that time. This greater transfer of property occurred during the father's lifetime:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"But although many of the sons of rich farmers may be badly situated following their father's death, there are some who will be exceptionally well placed. As under systems of primogeniture, it may be that one son (or perhaps two or more) is effectively the father's heir and successor, while his brothers are not. This is not because of any blatant inequality in the division of physical property at the time of his father's death, but because a man's eldest son (or elder sons) may have had special opportunities ... of establishing a secure position in life, while under his father".&lt;ref&gt;Rural Hausa: A Village and a Setting Written By Polly Hill https://books.google.com/books?id=QXFmu4tt6GkC&amp;pg=PA182&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Eric J. Arnould described the social organization of Hausa farm villages as follows in "Marketing and Social Reproduction in Zinder, Niger Republic":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Each hausa farm village was built up around a core family group (dengi) composed of agnatic kinfolk. The fundamental unit of residence, production, distribution, transmission, and reproduction was the gida. At a mature stage of the domestic cycle the gida was a patrilocal multiple family household of at least two generations depth and comprising the conjugal family units (iyali) of the household head (mai gida) and his married sons and their children. Some wealthier gida contained farm slaves. The gida was essentially a family farming unit (FFU)  distinguished from other FFU by usufructory rights of tenure to dune (jigawa) and marsh (fadama) lands, control of its own granary, and disposition of the labor power of its active members. The household hhead (mai gida) partitioned the household land into gandu (collective) and gamana (individual) parcels. Men worked together on the gandu five days a week. The mai gida held the fruits of gandu production in trust and was obliged to feed, clothe, and pay taxes and ceremonial expenses of his household from the gandu produce during the agricultural season. With the help of the extended agnatic kin group the mai gida ensured that his sons and daughters would marry. Individual and junior iyali fed themselves during the dry season from the fruits of the gandu produce during the agricultural season. With the help of the exntended agnatic kin group the mai gida ensured tha his sons and daughters would marry. Individuals and junior iyali fed themselves during the dry season from the fruits of the gamana and, in addition, used gamana produce to participate in ceremonial events and exchanges (baptisms, marriages, funerals). Gandu produce could never be sold; gamana produce could be, but the bulk of production took place on gandu plots. On the death of the mai gida the inheriting sons did not immediately divide the land and slaves but continued to work together, the eldest brother assuming the role of mai gida. At this stage of the developmental cycle the gida became a frereche. As the families of the brothers grew, they divided the patrimony. Usually junior brothers were compelled to clear new bush lands".

=== East Africa ===

A system of ranking and patrilineal primogeniture similar to that of many southern African peoples seems to have traditionally prevailed among the [[Nilotic]] peoples of [[South Sudan]] with regards to land (the eldest son of the first wife was the heir of his father's land, residential and arable, and the land of each house was inherited by the heir of that house, i.e., the eldest son of the head wife in the house).&lt;ref&gt;PROPERTY AND VALUE—INTERPLAY AMONG THE NILOTES OF THE SOUTHERN SUDAN By FRANCIS M.

However, it should be kept in mind that the system of social organization characteristic of most East African peoples was the segmentary lineage organization as described by [[Evans Pritchard's]] famous work on the [[Nuer people|Nuer]].

=== Central Africa ===

Sahlins considered the conical clan typical of some central African [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] lineage organizations. He didn't elaborate further on this point. According to him, "Called conical clan by Kirchoff, at one time ramage by Firth and status lineage by Goldman, the Polynesian ranked lineage is the same in principle as the so-called obok system widely distributed in Central Asia, and it is at least analogous to the Scottish clan, the Chinese clan, certain Central African Bantu lineage systems, the house-groups of Northwest Coast Indians, perhaps even the "tribes" of the Israelites".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tapera.info/textos/sahlins, hrhp.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328123831/http://tapera.info/textos/sahlins, hrhp.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Éric de Dampierre found this type of social organization to be prevalent among the [[Azande people|Azande]]. He discussed this in his work "Sons aînés, sons cadets: les sanza d'Ebézagui",&lt;ref&gt;Sons aînés, sons cadets: les sanza d'Ebézagui Éric de Dampierre Revue de Musicologie T. 68, No. 1/2, Les fantaisies du voyageur. XXXIII Variations Schaeffner (1982), pp. 325-329 Published by: Société Française de Musicologie Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/928297&lt;/ref&gt; where he explained that among the [[Azande people|Azande]] elder sons and their lines of descent were ranked higher than younger sons and their lines of descent. Male primogeniture, a typical feature of a social structure of this type, also prevailed among many Cameroonian peoples (such as for example the [[Masa people|Masa]]&lt;ref&gt;Les Massa du Cameroun Garine, Igor de http://www.iberlibro.com/Massa-Cameroun-Garine-Igor-PUF/2048148360/bd&lt;/ref&gt;), eastern and northern Congo peoples (such as the [[Ngala]]), and the [[Gbaya people|Gbaya]] and the [[Mossi people|Mossi]], all this according to the Ethnographic Atlas. However, in Angola, Gabon and most of the rest of Congo, lateral rather than lineal succession was the rule, and most Chadian peoples commonly divided land and livestock equally between all sons.

Patrilineal primogeniture also prevailed among the [[Songye people|Songye]] and the [[Buduma people|Buduma]], according to the Ethnographic Atlas.

In traditional Austronesian societies (roughly those of modern-day [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Philippines]], [[East Timor]], [[Brunei]], [[Madagascar]] and [[Oceania]]), seniority of birth and of descent generally determined rank, often leading to the fission of those lowest in rank (younger sons from younger branches),&lt;ref name="epress.anu.edu.au"&gt;Chapter 2.

==== Polynesia ====

The social system of [[Polynesians]] was similar to that of the southern Bantu. As Sahlins writes, "The mode of succession is primogeniture; the eldest son succeeds to the position of his father. ... Not only is he differentiated from his younger brothers, but so also is every brother differentiated from every other, in accordance with their respective order of birth and the consequent prospects of succeeding to the position of their father. ... The seniority principle in the family is a microcosm of the ramified social system. ... As a consequence of seniority, the descendants of an older brother rank higher than the descendants of a younger brother. ... Every individual within this group of descendants of a common ancestor holds a differing status, one precisely in proportion to his distance from the senior line of descent in the group. ... People descendent from remote collaterals of the common ancestor are lower in rank than those descendent from a more immediate relative of the chiefly line. People with the lowest status are those who have descended from younger brothers through younger brothers ad infinitum. The process of primogenitural succession and its consequent implication of seniority result in a ranking structure which encompasses the entire society. ... In every ramified society one can recognise groups of statuses or status levels which are functionally significant in terms of differential socio-economic prerogatives. These different levels are normally present in all the larger ramages."&lt;ref&gt;Sahlins (1958), pp. 140-2, 147. His italics.&lt;/ref&gt; These principles of seniority of descent structured and organized traditional Maori society, for example. Bernard Willard Aginsky and Te Rangi Hiroa write in "Interacting forces in the Maori family":

"Primogeniture is well established as the method of passing wealth, honor, titles, and other prerogatives from generation to generation. The Maori desire to have their first-born be male. The desire is especially acute in chiefly families. If the first-born is a male, he is considered an especially "big man" and the people rejoice because "a chief is born." If a
daughter is born first, it is a case of "bad luck," but it does not affect the right of the first-born male to primogeniture. He succeeds to his father's position in the normal course of events. But the sister is senior and all her descendants will, in each generation, be senior to her brother's descendants. The family and the people do not like this to happen. The man and his sons and daughters have to pay more deference to her and her sons and daughters than otherwise, because she is "senior." Thus a man would have to pay respect to a female when the desire was for the established pattern which was the opposite. The same holds true for families not of chiefly blood. ... This came about in the Maori culture due to the fact that the elder brother takes precedence over his siblings on the basis of precedence of birth which carried with it many prerogatives. There are times when a particularly brilliant younger male is placed in the position of the "first-born" by the father due to his superior abilities. This depends upon the first-born not being at all outstanding, in fact, being of decidedly inferior quality. Although this occurs, it is not the pattern for the younger males of a fraternity to try to compete for the position. In the vast majority of cases, the eldest male is recognized as being the male who will succeed and does succeed to the father's position. ... The most important distinction which was made between all individuals was whether they were junior or senior to each other. This was determined by tracing their lineage back to the time when they both had the same male ancestor. The children of this ancestor became the real point at which the
distinction began. If "my" ancestor was a younger brother or sister of ((your" ancestor, then "I" would be of the junior lineage and ((you" would be of the senior lineage. The male lineages were the important ones in the society, but at the same time the female lineages had to be reckoned with. ... The first-born, being of the highest rank and power, caused the people to want a male to be the first-born. The Maori are patrilocal and patrilineal and if a female was the first-born, in the vast majority of cases she took that prestige to her husband's tribe when she married. She automatically passed it on to his children. In this way, the female was taking away from the tribe what rightfully belonged to them and was giving it to another tribe which was a potential enemy. Thus the children of a female became the members of another group. In many cases hard feelings, antagonisms and even war sprang up between these two groups. Then these children, the male children of your own females, became enemies in policy and oftentimes in fact. ... The Maori have evaded that possibility to some extent by tracing their main genealogy through the first-born males only. Thus, theoretically, there is only one line in each family which is counted, first-born males of the first-born males. This is the sociological tree of the Maori, not the biological tree. The biological tree would be represented by a triangle with the man at the apex and extended to his descendants, and by an inverted triangle viewed by a man looking at his ancestors. There would be no genealogical line, except when a relationship was established between two individuals of different generations. The line would exclude from consideration all the other individuals in the biological tree. But every time a relationship was established between two individuals of different generations, a new line would be drawn for the sake of convenience. Thus if your great-grandmother through your father (father's mother's mother) had been married to your great-grandfather through your mother (mother's mother's father), your biological tree would have fewer branches than the perfect biological tree and fewer lines could be drawn. ... Brothers call each other by terms designating "born before me, takes precedence over me, comes before me, etc.," or the converse "born after me" etc.' The oldest male calls all the males in his fraternity by one term, and the youngest calls all the male members of his fraternity by another term. Thus, taken from the standpoint of every member of a fraternity speaking of every other member, they are all equated (as are their cousins, both cross and parallel). A child of any one of these individuals will follow his father's identifications and call all these men by one term, although he is cognizant of the paternity of his father ... The importance of the senior and junior lines and of the degree of relationship played a large part in the Maori social and political life. For example, if one tribe was visiting another, the old man who was the specialist on genealogies, and incidentally was an honored man for this accomplishment, would recite the genealogies. He would start at the very beginning when the first boat-load landed at that spot, over twenty generations before, and finally come to the split where two brothers became separated by having gone on different expeditions, or something of that nature. These two tribes are now the descendants of the two brothers. They are relatives and all of the members of the two tribes know their relationships to one another. The senior group, by establishing itself as such, is then in the position to command respect and a certain amount of deference from the junior group. But this was really a ceremonial usage of the genealogy and while the two groups were together it had its place ... When a marriage between two groups, or of a chiefly man in a group came about, or the death of an important individual, other groups visited them. Then the recounting of genealogies began and relationships would be established. Thus they would know whether to treat a man with respect or whether to expect a man to treat them with respect, as well as the individual treatments due to brother-sister relationship and so on. When two tribes came together they started their recounting of the genealogies from the original settler and came down perhaps five, ten or fifteen generations when a split occurred and a younger male left the main group to settle somewhere else. At this point the old man would say "and so and so, the younger, went away. I leave him to you." Then he would go on showing how his line, and particularly he, was the direct descendant of the original settler. In this way he would establish his seniority and prestige. The other group would thus be placed in the position of being the junior lineage and therefore of less importance and prestige. A member of the visiting group would recognize the genealogy and pick up where the old man had "given him his ancestor." He would continue the line down and show that he and his people were the relatives of the other group in the junior lineage and therefore of less importance and prestige in that locality. In his own locality, the visitor might have prestige by right of conquest or from intermarriage. A member of the visiting group would recognize the genealogy and pick up where the old man had "given him his ancestor." He would continue the line down and show that he and his people were the relatives of the other group. In this way he, at the same time, acknowledges that his tribe is the junior group in that particular lineage and in that district. The genealogical status, which is of course the biological tree, excluding the branches for the most part, was established and memorized. This was of the utmost importance in the tribe, especially for the chiefs. This was a mark of rank, prestige and honor."&lt;ref&gt;INTERACTING FORCES IN THE MAORI FAMILY*  By BERNARD WILLARD AGINSKY aid TE RANG1 HIROA (PETER H.

The ramage or conical prevailed in early China, during the [[Longshan culture]] period and the period of the Three Dynasties (Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties).&lt;ref&gt;Archaeological Thought in America edited by C. C. Lamberg-Karlovsky https://books.google.com/books?id=uc3ZokKnaQYC&amp;pg=PA160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;China: Ancient Culture, Modern Land edited by Robert E. Murowchick https://books.google.com/books?id=tO42ZlxKf4cC&amp;pg=PA65&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert E. Murowchick wrote the following about the [[Longshan culture]] in "China: Ancient Culture, Modern Land": "a kinship system in which people live in lineages; the status of members within the lineages, and of the different lineages themselves are dependent upon their proximity to the main line of descent from founding ancestor to current lineage head, probably through male primogeniture (as suggested by all texts relating to early China). Apparently the Longshan people were organized, according to early historical records, as ancient Chinese people were, into segmentary lineages, and their political status, both within lineages and between them, was predetermined in a hierarchical fashion. This kind of kinship groups is sometimes referred to as the conical clan, and is often prevalent among societies that tend to branch off and send the branch segments to colonize new territories, where they establish new settlements and new polities".&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=tO42ZlxKf4cC&amp;pg=PA65&lt;/ref&gt;

C. C. Lamberg-Karlovsky wrote the following about the period of the Three Dynasties (Xia, Shang and Zhou) in "Archaeological Thought in America": "The Chinese state of the Three Dynasties, which did possess both law and military force, was, nevertheless, built upon a hierarchical system of segmentary lineages, where the distance away from the main line of patrilineal descent determined political status and the share of political power. Members of these lineages inhabited the walled towns, which constituted stratified networks ruled by the state government. the king sat at the top of the conical clan and, at the same time, at the top of the hierarchical state".

Bruce G. Trigger wrote the following about the [[Shang dynasty]] in "Understanding Early Civilizations: A Comparative Study": "Family life in Shang China was structured by patrilineal descent. Each corporate descent group (zu) inhabited a single community, and its male members worked a tract of land or practised a particular craft. Among the upper classes, two or more generations of a family belonging to a corporate descent group lived, under the authority of its senior male member, in a house composed of living rooms, shrines, reception halls, and work areas arranged around a series of open courts. Commoners appear to have lived in smaller, possibly nuclear family houses, but married sons remained subject to the authority of their fathers and uncles. Each corporate descent group traced its origin to a single male ancestor who was venerated by all his male descendants. Within the descent group patrilineal descent lines were hierarchically organized, with descent from elder brothers invariably ranking higher than descent from younger brothers. The oldest member of the senior line (da zong) was the group's leader and the sole person who could perform rituals honouring the group's deceased founder and chief guardian spirit. When a group had expanded until it contained over one hundred nuclear families (this was estimated to take seven generations), it split into two and the junior branch moved off to establish a new group. It is generally assumed that already in Shang times all the patrilineal descent groups that could trace themselves back to a common ancestor shared a surname and constituted an exogamous clan (xing). Clans took the form of large ramages, which meant that their various descent lines (zu, shi) were ranked in terms of their genealogical proximity to the clan's founder. ... Most lower-class Shang Chinese were monogamous. To ensure the birth of sons, who would perpetuate their lineage, upper-class men frequently acquired secondary wives. ... The male heir of a man's position was normally the eldest son of his first chief wife".&lt;ref&gt;Understanding Early Civilizations: A Comparative Study Written By Bruce G. Trigger https://books.google.com/books?id=ZEX-yZOAG9IC&amp;pg=PA168&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote the following about the specific case of the inheritance of political power: "Strong emphasis was placed at all levels of Shang society on the ranking of descent lines within clans and on birth order among siblings of the same sex. Power and authority passed from a man to his eldest son or from older to younger brothers within a specific descent line. Supreme power was vested in the senior line of the Zi clan. Males who were closely related to reigning or previous kings held important court offices or administered territories. Regional offices tended to remain hereditary in the senior male line of their occupants. As the state expanded, new territories were established where younger sons of officials might be installed. Thus officials of higher genealogical status tended to hold land closer to the centre of the state and participated in the functioning of the court while others lived farther away. As lineages expanded, it was increasingly difficult to find positions for younger sons that would allow them to maintain an upper-class lifestyle. Territories were also assigned to leaders of clans that supported the Zi, while some conquered rulers were allowed to govern all or part of their former territories as Shang vassals. These officials were permitted to marry female members of the royal clan, and some of the most important of them married women of the royal lineage. The Shang upper class thus became a network of officials related directly or indirectly to the king. Officials who governed administrative territories bore the titles hou (archer lord?), bo (patriarch?), and tian or dian (field lord). While these positions normally were hereditary, successors, at least at the higher levels, had to be confirmed by the king, who could also promote or remove individuals from their offices. Officials who headed junior branches of a clan remained ritually and socially subordinate to the leaders of the senior branches from which they had split off, even when they lived far apart".&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=ZEX-yZOAG9IC&amp;pg=PA149&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of the [[Zhou dynasty]], patrilineal primogeniture (the tsung-fa system) was also the norm, as Li Hwei explains in "The ramage system in China and Polynesia". He wrote: "All the essential features of the Polynesian ramage -the principle of fission and dispersion, the succession by primogeniture, the differentiation of rank through the operation of seniority, the localization of the ramage groups,- are present in Chou Tsung-fa system in ancient China. Both of these systems involve patrilineal inheritance and the prevalence of adoption, but involve no exogamy. Both of them are reflected in the system of ancestral temples. ... the Tsung-fa system in the Chou dynasty in ancient China is essentially similar to the ramage system among the modern Polynesians".&lt;ref&gt;The ramage system in China and Polynesia Li Hwei {{cite web |url=http://c.ianthro.tw/sites/c.ianthro.tw/files/da/df/401/401104_0001.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055816/http://c.ianthro.tw/sites/c.ianthro.tw/files/da/df/401/401104_0001.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Li Hwei also points out that the ramage system of the [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] (an aboriginal Taiwanese tribe) was based on a rule of absolute primogeniture (the eldest child inherits regardless of sex), not on a rule of patrilineal primogeniture (eldest son inherits) as in China and [[Polynesia]].

The tsung-fa system, also called "extensive stratified patrilineage", was defined as follows by the anthropologist Chang Kuang-chih: "The tsung-fa system of Chou is characterized by the fact that the eldest son of each generation formed the main line of descent and political authority, whereas the younger brothers were moved out to establish new lineages of lesser authority. The farther removed, the lesser the political authority". According to Tao (1934: 17-31), "the Tsung-fa or descent line system has the following characteristics: patrilineal descent, patrilineal succession, patriarchate, sib-exogamy, and primogeniture".&lt;ref&gt;Tao, Hsi-Sheng. Marriage and Family, Shanghai. 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

K.E. Brashier writes in his book "Ancestral Memory in Early China" about the tsung-fa system of patrilineal primogeniture: "The greater lineage, if it has survived, is the direct succession from father to eldest son and is not defined via the collateral shifts of the lesser lineages. In discussions that demarcate between trunk and collateral lines, the former is called a zong and the latter a zu, whereas the whole lineage is dubbed the shi.  ... On one hand every son who is not the eldest and hence not heir to the lineage territory has the potential of becoming a progenitor and fostering a new trunk lineage (Ideally he would strike out to cultivate new lineage territory). ... According to the Zou commentary, the son of heaven divided land among his feudal lords, his feudal lords divided land among their dependent families and so forth down the pecking order to the officers who had their dependent kin and the commoners who "each had his apportioned relations and all had their graded precedence""&lt;ref&gt;Ancestral Memory in Early China Written By K. E. Brashier https://books.google.com/books?id=aJAMLt5NYAQC&amp;pg=PA71&lt;/ref&gt;

Patricia Ebrey defines the descent-line system as follows: "A great line (ta-tsung) is the line of eldest sons continuing indefinitely from a founding ancestor. A lesser line is the line of eldest sons going back no more than five generations. Great lines and lesser lines continually spin off new lesser lines, founded by younger sons".

Strong traits of the tsung-fa system of patrilineal primogeniture survived in the lineage organizations of north China until the communist era. Myron L. Cohen writes in "Kinship, Contract, Community, And State: Anthropological Perspectives On China": "The north China data reveal a dimension of agnatic kinship previously not seen as significant in lineage organization. In what I call the fixed genealogical mode of agnatic kinship patrilineal ties are figured on the basis of the relative seniority of descent lines, so that the unity of the lineage as a whole is based upon a ritual focus on the senior descent line traced back to the founding ancestor, his eldest son, and the succession of eldest sons. ... lineages can be subdivided into branches based upon the nonequivalence of lines of descent. A branch tracing its origin from the eldest son of the founding ancestor is seen to be in a relationship of ritual superiority to those branches deriving from the younger brothers. Members of different branches are thus related to each other not only in terms of common descent, but also on the basis of permanent horizontal ties between senior and junior descent lines".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kinship, Contract, Community, And State: Anthropological Perspectives On China Written by Myron L.

In South Asia, the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Aryans]] were also organized in a system of ranked patrilines where senior patrilines were superior to junior patrilines:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The bifurcation in clan status increased, with status differences between lines descending
from an older and younger son, with specially higher status given to those who demonstrated
leadership qualities--the ability to lead cattle, raids, to protect the clan, to establish new
settlements, and to manage alliances with other clans. The rajanya families were characterized as chariot-riders and warriors, while the vish were sedentary folk, producers of pastoral and
agricultural items. They were the lesser status, junior lineages in clans and as such they had the obligation to give some of their product to the rajanyas and to priests and bards. They were to give the oblations--sacrificial items--which the priests offered at ritual ceremonies which the rajanya organized. The priests, which came to be known as brahmins, legitimized the superior status and authority of the rajanya at these rituals. (Brahmin is often also spelled Brahman.) They invest the chiefs with attributes of the deities."&lt;ref&gt;The Vedic Age, 1500-500 B.C. Pamela Price http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/iakh/HIS2172/h10/undervisningsmateriale/his2172%20til%20forelesning.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[Paite people|Paite]] had a similar system, strongly based on primogeniture and patrilineality and reinforced by a characteristic system of name-giving:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Position of a child in a family determines who will be its name-giver. The first son of the second son receives his name from his father's eldest brother or father's father. Any first born son of younger sons receives his name from paternal side to emphasize patrilineality and seniority of the child concerned. The first sons of the younger brothers also get names from paternal kinsmen while the first daughter gets her name from her maternal kinsmen. As in the case of the third child of the eldest brother the tanupi gets a chance to give name to the third child of the younger brother. Death of the first child or the second child in childhood reverts the process. ... The rule of giving names to the children of more brothers cannot follow the same procedure in precision. Importance is given to the first son of the eldest son in which case the male line is strictly adhered to. The eldest son of the eldest son or eldest brother is the link between the generation of his father and his own children. He is also the lineage leader. Formerly he was known as tuulpi, e.g. ritual leader of the lineage. This line of descent is the main line in conical clan system of the paite. So long as it continues to exist this senior descent line is regarded as innpi (principal house) by the younger brothers or the cadet lines. The name-giving system of the Paite serves as an infallible record of pedigree. Depth of generation is acertainable through the name giving system as every grandfather transmits the last word of his name to his eldest grandson born to his eldest son. By correlating the names of grandsons and grandfathers one can determine whether a particular son is the eldest son of the eldest son or they are the younger ones. So a son of a younger brother cannot easily claim seniority over the son of the eldest brother and his descendants. The eldest son of the eldest brother has muniments to defend his seniority in the derivation of his name. When a child is born in a family the villagers say, "So and so gives birth to a child". What is the sex of the infant? What is its position in the family? asks someone. "It is the third child and the first female child in the family" comes the answer. "Well! If it is so, she will get her name from the female tanupi" concludes the other. Since patriliny and primogeniture are so much emphasized in Paite society the younger brothers and sisters of the ascending generations are not remembered in the next few generations. But the names of the eldest sons or brothers in each generation are more or less well remembered in subsequent generations as the name-giving system reveals it."&lt;ref&gt;The Paite, a Transborder Tribe of India and Burma Written By H. Kamkhenthang https://books.google.com/books?id=n7CdTs3Iq78C&amp;pg=PA123&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A conical clan system also prevailed among the [[Naga people|Nagas]]. In the beginning it vas based on a principle of male ultimogeniture, being very similar to Kachin gumsa; however, when all available land had been divided between communities in a given neighbourhood, male primogeniture became the dominant principle.&lt;ref&gt;Social Dynamics in the Highlands of Southeast Asia: Reconsidering Political ...  edited by François Robinne, Mandy Sadan https://books.google.com/books?id=YitZ0YodsJcC&amp;pg=PA114&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inner Asia ===

Owen Lattimore wrote that the Mongols have a clan structure comprising ruling and subordinate clans, and that the elite clans are themselves internally divided into junior and elder lineages. Karl Kaser attributes the inexistence of different terms to designate an elder and a younger brother in [[Languages of Europe|European]] languages to the high prevalence of ultimogeniture among the [[Europe]]an peasantry.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Famine: northern Europe in the Early Fourteenth Century Written By William Chester Jordan https://books.google.com/books?id=R6mBDhnM76EC&amp;pg=PA93&lt;/ref&gt; Although male primogeniture came to be almost universal in the [[European aristocracy]], peasants practiced both male primogeniture and ultimogeniture, and thus there was no overall preeminence of elder over younger brothers or vice versa. He says that among peoples of Inner Asian origin, by contrast, seniority between sons was emphasized, and thus there were separate terms to designate elder and younger brothers in their languages.&lt;ref&gt;Patriarchy After Patriarchy: Gender Relations in Turkey and in the Balkans ... Written By Karl Kaser https://books.google.com/books?id=_KEW6l-stCUC&amp;pg=PA42&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the Mongol kinship, for example, is according to Lévi-Strauss one of a type where sons must be carefully distinguished according to seniority, because of the complexity of the right of inheritance, which contemplates not only seniority of birth but also of patriline.&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, C. 1969. The Elementary Structures of Kinship.&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropologist Herbert Harold Vreeland, who visited three Mongol communities in 1920, published a highly detailed book with the results of his field study, "Mongol community and kinship structure", now publicly available. In this book he explained the ranking system prevalent in traditional Mongol communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015008324819;view=1up;seq=1&lt;/ref&gt;

He said about the [[Khalka]] Mongols: "The family was based on monogamous marriage. Polygyny occurred, but was very rare and countenanced only for reason of sterility in the first wife. ... Custom required that at least one of the man's sons should remain always with the parents to care for them in their old age and to inherit the core of the family's property; but other sons were generally given separate shares and their economic independence, plus the movable nature of the property itself, made it possible for them to leave their father's camp. ... The terms abaga and aca are used to express not only ascendant-descendant generational ranking, but also the relative seniority of two collateral lines. Where successive generations descend patrilineally from two brothers, the line from the elder brother is the senior line, and the line from the younger brother is the junior line. All successive generations in the senior line are senior to corresponding generations in the junior line, and are known collectively as the abagiin üye ("uncle" generations); reciprocally, all generations in the junior line are known as the aciin üye ("nephew" generations). Hence, persons in corresponding generations in two collateral lines refer to each other reciprocally as abaga aha/egci and aca hüu/hüuhen. Under these circumstances, relative age terms are not employed. That is, Ego cannot say abaga düu for an abaga cousin younger than himself, nor aca aha for an aca cousin older than himself. The reason for this is clear: the Khalka system distinguishes between paternal cousins solely on the basis of the relative seniority of the two brothers who head the collateral lines, and makes these distinctions by using generation terms (abaga, aca) instead of relative age terms (aha, düü). The relative age of two cousins is not considered in the reckoning. ... The terms üyeeld, hayaald, etc. are combined with the terms abaga and aca so that collateral kinsmen may be distinguished not only according to whether they are in ascendant or descendant generations, or of senior or junior rank, with respect to the speaker. [..] Where equality of age and generation tended to minimize reserve, seniority ranking tended to increase it - i.e. in the presence of one's age and generation equals, one was more reserved if they were of senior rank than if they were of equal rank. ... Younger siblings addressed elder siblings as aha or egci, and were in turn addressed by their personal names. If there were several elder siblings of same sex, the younger sibling generally addressed only the eldest as aha or egci, and the others by abgailana terms. ... Ordinarily, younger siblings did not call elder siblings by their personal names. ... An elder brother could punish a younger brother by striking him, and the younger brother was expected not to strike back if he was not of age. When he came of age, he could strike back with impunity. However, a family was criticized by outsiders if two brothers had a long-standing feud, and quarrels between siblings were considered worse than those between spouses. ... An elder brother couuld ask a younger brother to perform certain services for him - e.g. saddle his horse - but younger brothers did not expect the service to be reciprocated. ... When an elder brother assumed trusteeship of the family after the father's death, he did not merit from his brothers all the respect shown to the father by his sons. In such cases, younger brothers often fought with elder brothers over shares allotted to them at the time the property was finally divided; this is one of the reasons why fathers liked to divide property before their death".

About the [[Chahar Mongols]] he wrote: "The family was based on monogamous marriage. Polygyny occurred, but was very rare and countenanced only for reason of sterility in the first wife. ... With respect to the authority structure of the family, there appears to have been little difference between the Mongol families of Taibas Pasture and those of the Narobanchin territory ... The father, or the eldest brother, was nominal head of the house by virtue of age seniority; he controlled the capital wealth of the family, supervised the work of junior male members, and in general disciplined the males, although he had the right to discipline daughters as well, short of striking. ... The Chahar kinship terminology system presented here appears to be basically the same as the system presented for the Khalkas ... Younger siblings addressed their elder siblings with abgailana terms. Where there were several elder siblings of same sex, qualifying terms of all sorts were added to distinguish them. Elder siblings addressed younger siblings by their personal names, or, in an affectionate or joking way, as düügei. A younger sibling never addressed an elder sibling by name. ... A group of relatives, all of whom shared independently and in common a single unit of family property, was known as örehe. The senior male, who had authority over this group, managed the family property and made any necessary division of property. Family property was normally transferred to sons by a combination of both division and inheritance. When there was only one son, there was usually no division, the son remaining with his parents and inheriting the estate from them when they came enfeebled or died. Where there were several sons, the father usually divided the property during his own lifetime, giving a separate share to each son except to the son who was chosen to inherit his parent's residual share. Traditionally, this was the youngest son; in practice, it was usually the son who had take care of his parents in their old age. ... Sons to whom property was divided did not necessarily get equal shares and the father retained for himself and his heir a share larger than any of those given to other sons. Marriage appears to have been a factor determining when sons received their shares, but the data here are not clear. ... If the property was not divided among two or more sons before the father's death, the eldest son became trustee, or the mother became trustee until the eldest son reached maturity. When younger brothers reached the point where they were entitled to separate shares, the elder brother made the division".

Among the Dagor Mongols, however, things were somewhat different: "As suggested by the sleeping and eating arrangements, the senior man and woman in the house were accorded special privileges. These included sleeping and eating in the position of honor, being served first, receiving the choice tidbits, the right to be greeted first by persons entering the room, and other courtesies of respect and deference. Seniority depended entirely on relative age and generation. While the father and the mother were alive, they were the senior couple. Where several married brothers continued to live together after the parents' death, the eldest brother and his wife moved automatically to the position of seniority". However, "Seniority status in the family affected only the allocation of respect and certain privileges in intra-familial courtesies and behavior, and was not directly related to the allocation of authority. The authority structure of the extended family was based partly on considerations of relative age and generation, but the senior man and woman of the house were not automatically the most authoritative people in the family, since considerations of a more practical nature entered in. ... Younger siblings addressed their elder siblings as akaa and ekee, and were in turn addressed by their personal names, or as dew. Younger siblings never addressed elder siblings by their personal names. Brothers were rarely on terms of easy friendship with each other; they were reserved and did not joke. An elder brother could punish a younger brother physically. Although brothers might loan each other their clothes, they did not undress in each other's presence. Brothers were, on the other hand, considerably less reserved with their sisters, and could joke with them. This relationship continued throughout life. After marriage a woman felt closer to her brothers than to her sisters, because her brothers remained together in the old family home, and represented her family and ultimate authority. ... A married son or brother was always entitled to a share of the property if he desired to set up house for himself. If two or more sons left they were given equal shares".

A strict fraternal hierarchy prevailed among Mongols, and slave (''bogol'') is equated with the category of a younger brother in The Secret History.&lt;ref&gt;The Secret History of the Mongols: The Life and Times of Chinggis Khan Written By Professor Urgunge Onon, Urgunge Onon https://books.google.com/books?id=JtOqIc9t2qsC&amp;pg=PA376&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gumer.info"&gt;Крадин H., Скрынникова Т.

Mongol literature is full of events of this kind.  Models of opposition between the egalitarianism of Arab societies and the hierarchical tribalism of Turco-Mongol peoples have been developed by many anthropologists, such as Cuisenier, Beck,&lt;ref name="Beck, L 1986"&gt;Beck, L. 1986.

He wrote there: "Nevertheless, this uniform kinship structure was divided into unequal estates, the nobility and the commoners. Both were estates related by descent from the clan founder; but in practice they were divided by differences in birth, wealth, accident migrations, wars. Descent lines were not equal; the line of the firstborn was more highly placed than any other, having the right of seniority… Leadership was a status that was not assigned by rote-it had to be achieved, and achievement was based on social recognition of leadership qualities." Sevʹi͡an Izrailevich Vaĭnshteĭn also remarks the existence of a strong fraternal hierarchy among Inner Asian (Siberian and central Asian) peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Nomads of South Siberia: The Pastoral Economies of Tuva Written By Sevʹi͡an Izrailevich Vaĭnshteĭn https://books.google.com/books?id=tas8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA28&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Mongols, the marking of livestock reflected this system of social stratification. E. Landais wrote in "The marking of livestock in traditional pastoral societies": "The system is based on a series of related marks that are derived from a primary mark designating the clan, which is then combined with other marks some of which are called complementary marks. These cannot be used as primary marks. The complementary marks have both syntactical and semantic properties. For instance, the 'throne' mark indicates that the owner descends from the eldest branch of his lineage, since this line, in the primogeniture system, is the one that inherits the images of the spirits of the ancestors that sit on the throne. Some of these marks, such as the 'thumb' and 'tail', the 'horn' and 'foot', the 'sun' and 'moon', are associated by pairs, or in any case suggest the existence of another mark of greater or lesser value, as applicable. An additional mark located on the right of the main mark denotes primogeniture as opposed to a left-hand position. An inverted mark along the horizontal or sagittal plane of symmetry indicates a socially inferior rank to that indicated by the primary mark.

The princes (who descend from Genghis Khan through the paternal line) mark their horses on the right-hand-side, whereas common people mark them on the left. Brothers by the same father differentiate their marks by adding a sign (rather than subtracting one which might bring bad luck to the herd) and alter them as little as possible (they might simply move them to a different position)".&lt;ref&gt;The marking of livestock in traditional pastoral societies E. Landais http://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D2021.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas R. White and Ulla C. Johansen, in a study about Turkish nomads, denied the idea that the conical clan was the type of social organization prevalent in this group, but nevertheless found evidence that earlier-born sons (first sons when there were only two sons, and first and second sons when there were more than two) took on more leadership positions and had significantly more wives and children than their younger brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Analysis 18: Age Ranking and the Endoconical Clan Hypothesis 10.1: First and second sons are more important in marital relinking within the clan than are younger sons. Decentralized Leadership and Network Cohesion Decentralized Leadership and the Aydınlı Case http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/turks/Ch.-9.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Bates also tries to qualify the characterization of the social organization of the steppe pastoral nomads as a "conical clan", saying, just like Johansen about Turkish nomads, that among the [[Yörük]] nomads he studied social practices gave an advantage to elder brothers over younger ones, but this didn't mean that ranking was automatic, fixed; it was rather achieved:

"is not merely a linguistic phenomenon; it has considerable importance in interpersonal relations among siblings. What is relevant here with respect to segmentation is that the eldest of the brothers is held to be senior to all younger, irrespective of wealth, in situations of formal etiquette; he serves as spokesman when brothers act in concert. After the father's death he is obliged, more than the father in his lifetime, to provide for his single brothers, and to assist them in time of trouble . . . marriage takes place in order of birth, which again sets the order of household fissioning to form new ones as younger sons marry and bring their brides into the tent. This, of course, gives older brothers in any generation an earlier start in the production of progeny to further their name. . . . However, just as the point of segmentation does not depend entirely on genealogical depth, neither does the relative seniority of brothers escape the impact of political and residential fact in determining which of several will provide the name under which the group passes."&lt;ref&gt;Bates (1973:50-51)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other anthropologists such as [[Khazanov]], [[Lindner]], Fletcher and Sneath have also rejected the theory that the conical clan was the social structure typical of the Asian steppe, arguing, contrarily to other authors, that strict succession rules based on [[primogeniture]] didn't exist in these societies. Osman Aziz Basan, in his analysis of [[Turkic tribal confederations|Oguz]] society, found this social structure to be the dominant one, but nuanced by the importance of other factors such as "merit", as in the case of Turkish and [[Yörüks|Yorük]] nomads.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Seljuqs: A History'' Written By Osman Aziz Basan https://books.google.com/books?id=fm93Xk5OvisC&amp;pg=PA147&lt;/ref&gt; Bacon wrote: "seniority both of generation and of line were factors in selecting a chiefly successor, but ability was also of importance" (1958:58).

Some studies have found that Arab practices of [[endogamous]] marriage also benefitted elder sons and their lines of descent over younger sons and their lines of descent,&lt;ref name="persee.fr"&gt;Famille et tenure paysanne : aux origines de la guerre des Paysans en Allemagne David Sabean lien Annales.

It was customary in the [[Ottoman Empire]] to let the sons of a king fight amongst themselves for the kingdom. It was almost always the eldest son, however, who succeeded in gaining the throne for himself, such as in the cases of [[Bayezid II]], [[Mehmet III]] or [[Murad III]]. Halil Inalcik is of the opinion that among [[Inner Asian]] peoples there was no rule of succession, but notes that the first [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultans were all eldest sons and finds parallels between this tendency to make the eldest son the next king and the steppe customs of making the eldest son of the eldest line sovereign, giving the eldest son the largest share of the inheritance and the most important part of the realm, and ranking the tents in order of importance from the father's to the eldest son's and then to the eldest brother's sons; according to him, these customs were particularly common among the [[Kazakhs]].&lt;ref&gt;The Ottoman Succession and its Relation to the Turkish Concept of Sovereignty http://www.inalcik.com/images/pdfs/26854379OTTOMANSUCCESSiON.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have also considered [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] society an especially good example of the Inner Asian conical clan,&lt;ref&gt;Ethnodemographic situation in Kazakhstan {{cite web |url=http://www.ide.go.jp/English/Publish/Download/Mes/pdf/51_02.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120133116/http://www.ide.go.jp/English/Publish/Download/Mes/pdf/51_02.pdf |archivedate=2013-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kazakhstan - Ethnicity, Language and Power Written By Bhavna Dave https://books.google.com/books?id=xEUq5oMmf8oC&amp;pg=PA33&lt;/ref&gt; although others consider Mongol society the paradigm of this type of society in the Asian steppe.&lt;ref name="gumer.info"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mongolian Nomadic Society of the Empire Period* Tatyana D.

In Iran, male primogeniture was the rule within the Qashqai confederacy.&lt;ref name="Beck, L 1986"/&gt; Within this confederacy there were three levels of leadership, and both Khan and headmen appropriated taxes and labor from members of their groups, though only the lineages of the Khans and Ilkhanis (paramount chieftains) constituted an aristocracy (Beck 1986: 193–195, 233). Thus the Qashqa'i confederacy can be considered to have been a true chiefdom confederacy. It is the contention of Lois Beck that this confederacy was a product of the interaction of nomads with the economy and institutions of the Persian state over the last 300 years (Ibid.)

=== Japan, Korea, Vietnam ===

As can be seen from the former examples, societies based on lineage hierarchy are particularly common in central, east and southeast [[Asia]]. Lineage hierarchy was present even in the stem-family systems of Korea, [[Vietnam]] and Japan. In Korea, the main house, that of the eldest son, was called the "big house" or superordinate descent group (taejong), while the houses of younger sons were called "small houses" or subordinate descent groups (sojong). It was through the stem family of the eldest son that the main line of descent was traced from generation to generation.&lt;ref&gt;Ancestor Worship and Korean Society Written By Roger L. and Dawnhee Yim Janelli https://books.google.com/books?id=VDRAah_jogMC&amp;pg=PA53&lt;/ref&gt; Patrilineal primogeniture became prevalent during the time of the [[Choson dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;The Confucian Transformation of Korea: A Study of Society and Ideology Written By Martina Deuchler https://books.google.com/books?id=NQeeYOyUx64C&amp;pg=PA283&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Legacy Lingers On: Korean Confucianism and the Erosion of Women's Rights Hildi Kang http://www.outreachworld.org/Files/University_of_California_Berkeley/Legacy1Background.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Even modern businesses are passed down according to male primogeniture in most cases.&lt;ref&gt;The State, Society and Big Business in South Korea Written By Yeon-Ho Lee https://books.google.com/books?id=O6x8VMKUFeoC&amp;pg=PA32&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing patterns of adoption in Korean families, Roger L. and Dawnhee Yim Janelli write in "Ancestor Worship and Korean Society":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When adoption involves the transfer of a son between households headed by brothers, the relative seniority of the brothers usually determines whether an eldest or junior son is selected as the adoptee. younger brothers give their eldest sons to eldest brothers, but eldest brothers give one of their younger sons to younger brothers. This rule, which is common throughout Korea, was violated only twice. In both cases, eldest brothers were given to younger sons. The nonreciprocal transfer of eldest sons to eldest brothers reflects the special status accorded to a primogeniture descendant (chongso: eldest son, eldest son's eldest son, etc.) by those who belong to junior descent lines. Just as an elder brother has a higher status than his younger siblings, so his own eldest son retains some of that status over the younger brothers's sons. Giving eldest sons to senior descent lines, therefore, preserves the relative statuses of siblings based on birthright. One who had enjoyed superior status as an eldest brother before adoption enjoys it as a primogeniture descendant after adoption. Occasional violations of this adoption rule wreak havoc on the relative seniority of descent lines. Violations occur because Korean adoption practices also attempt to preserve the respective property rights of descendants. Since an eldest brother inherits more property, he is usually wealthier than his younger siblings. If he dies without descendants, his younger brother would inherit his larger share of property from their parents and in turn pass it on to his own eldest son. That eldest son, by becoming the adoptive heir of the elder brother, therefore inherits essentially the same property he would have without the adoption".&lt;ref&gt;Ancestor Worship and Korean Society Written By Roger L. and Dawnhee Yim Janelli https://books.google.com/books?id=VDRAah_jogMC&amp;pg=PA54&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In Korea, chiefdom confederacies where male primogeniture was the rule were a fact of early Korean history since the first millennium BC. The first may have been Old Joseon (also Kochosŏn, Gojoseon), said to be a confederacy of three tribes (Lee et al. 2005: 53).3 'The Hwanug tribe formed an aggregation with adjacent tribes or villages and then subjugated other aggregations…' (ibid.: 54). 'Old Joseon was basically a confederation and could not be easily ruled from the center' (ibid.: 64). Old Joseon's counterpart in South Korea was Jin (also Chin), also described as a loose confederacy. These confederacies ultimately broke apart into their constituent units (geosuguk), which then reformed into new confederacies: Puyŏ (also Buyeo), Koguryŏ (also Goguryeo), Ye, the Three Han (Samhan), and Gaya. These chiefdom confederacies were eclipsed by the consolidation of three of these polities into the states of Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla in the first century CE. However even these polities did not really develop centralized systems of territorial administration until the fourth century AD (Lee et al. 2005: 179).

In Japan, too, the main house, that of the eldest son, was called "honke", while the houses of younger sons were called "bunke". Younger houses were theoretically subordinate to the eldest house. There was a peculiar family type, the dozoku, which consistently reproduced this hierarchical arrangement. Edward Norbeck found survivals of this family type even as late as during the 1950s in Tohoku, in northeastern Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Postwar Cultural Change and Continuity in northeastern Japan EDWARD NORBECK Rice University http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/aa.1961.63.2.02a00040/pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to the author,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The branch household stood in a social position much inferior to its founding household, and was expected to give aid to the founding household whenever it was needed. Many customs gave expression to the hierarchical relationship of the two households. Main households had obligations to their branches of providing economic support, but the greater obligation was undoubtedly upward, from bunke to honke. One of the standardized conventions of social interaction between the two was a formal exchange of greetings, congratulations, and small gifts at New Year's, the Buddhist Bon festival of midsummer, and at other ceremonial occasions. These exchanges were always initiated by the junior households, whose heads came at these occasions to call at the homes of the seniors."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, as the author also explains, not even in this region had the dozoku ever been popular, since establishing a branch family was generally difficult. Most "branch" families that had been established during the years immediately prior to his study had been established without the aid of the main house and functioned more or less independently from the latter.

Lineage hierarchy was also present in the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] family. Mark W. McLeod and Thi Dieu Nguyen write in "Culture and Customs of Vietnam":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In pre-colonial times, the Viet were defined first and foremost by their families, which were fundamentally patrilineal and patriarchal in character. The "clan" (toc), which included a number of families related to each other through a common male ancestor (thuy to), formed the basis of society. Each clan was identified by a specific lineage name (ho) or surname, of which there are approximately 300, the most common being "Nguyen", followed by "Tran", "Pham", and "Le." To the clan leader (truong toc) -the eldest male in the oldest branch directly descended from the founding ancestor- fell a number of duties: for instance, keeping and preserving the genealogical register (gia pha), which records the names, births, and deaths of members. Well kept registers would list the land or other properties used for the maintenance of the ancestral cult. The truong toc, who resided in the ancestral home and presided over the family council, was the one to whom related families or members within each familial unit would turn to resolve disputes; he made decisions related to lineage matters; and he served as the protector of widows and minors as well as the moral anchor for all within the clan. Within this larger body of the toc, there was the family (gia dinh): traditionally multigenerational (grandparents, parents, and children, uncles and aunts, and sometimes great-grandparents); it revolved around its central figure, the family head (gia truong) who could be the grandfather or the father (bo or thay). All owed obedience to him. The family head ruled over all family members in all matters, including property rights, education, marriage and profession, and he spoke on their behalf in dealings with the outside world. He had the power to reward or to chastise; to him were incumbent the duties of protection, of feeding, and of education, both morally and academically, vis-a-vis everyone in the family".&lt;ref&gt;Culture and Customs of Vietnam Written By Mark W. McLeod, Thi Dieu Nguyen https://books.google.com/books?id=a2TerRF1j74C&amp;pg=PA136&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Theresa Phuong-Thao Pham writes in "Family, Change and Mobility in a North Vietnamese Family":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The powerful lineage is known as the 'senior families' (ho dan anh) and the less powerful families are considered the 'junior families' (ho dan em). The patrilineage organization plays a role in the establishment of the villages and the development of the cultivated areas of North Vietnam (Nguyen 1993). The first group of people who left their native villages to establish new villages on new land acquisition was often composed of members of the same patrilineages. In a highly stratified society, the small families in the same patrilineage had different socio-economic positions, which can translate intocomplications for the kinship system. Traditional family record (gia pha) consists of the head of the lineage (toc truong), the heads of the branches (chi truong), a system of rituals composed of ancestor worship and the family temple, and economic means such as the family paddy fields (ruong ho) to support this worship. The family temple resembles clan system, in which members all the strands or chi of the family would pay homage on the death anniversaries of the toc truong (the head of the lineage). The redistribution of land by the Communist party since 1954 has greatly altered the family system of worship. The family temple no longer exists, but the celebration of the death anniversaries of ancestors still continues on a much smaller scale consisting of family members up to three generations. The celebration usually takes place at the eldest son's house with all immediate family members present on the death anniversary of the elder family member. The family members, usually the women, would place the food on the altar and offer the food to the deceased person before serving the food to the family members present at the meal. Family members often wear colorful headbands following the death of a family elder for up to three years".&lt;ref&gt;Family, Change and Mobility in a North Vietnamese Family by Theresa Phuong-Thao Pham https://www.academia.edu/3250376/Family_Change_and_Mobility_in_a_North_Vietnamese_Village&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the conical clan of the [[Asian steppe]], Austronesian societies and southern Bantu societies was based on a rule of [[primogeniture]]. E.R. Leach observes that a different system prevailed among the [[Kachin people|Kachin]]. The [[Kachin people|Kachin]] gave most of the land to the youngest son (patrilineal ultimogeniture) and most of the moveable property to the eldest son (patrilineal primogeniture). According to Leach, "the kachin gumsa situation is that both the eldest and the youngest son are privileged in relation to their other brothers. The eldest brother is ideally a warrior who goes out with a group of followers drawn from his father's relatives and supporters and carves for himself a new domain; the youngest brother stays at home and inherits the ritual function of guardian of the shrine and, in the case of a chief, of the madai nat." Lineage rank was also determined by patrilineal ultimogeniture: "The ritual status of the youngest son chief and his descendants is deemed to be higher than that of the eldest son chief and his descendants",&lt;ref&gt;Political Systems of Highland Burma: A Study of Kachin Social Structure Written By E. R. Leach https://books.google.com/books?id=wf13GFCK1-IC&amp;pg=PA261&lt;/ref&gt; while middle sons and their descendants are ranked even below eldest sons and their descendants. In case of death or inability of the youngest son, the eldest son inherits the land as well, in preference to a middle son. According to the same author, this principle of ultimogeniture-primogeniture is reversed in [[Assam]] and the North Triangle; among the Kachin population of these regions, the eldest son inherits the house and lands of the father and the youngest son inherits the moveable property.&lt;ref&gt;Political Systems of Highland Burma: A Study of Kachin Social Structure Written By E. R. Leach https://books.google.com/books?id=wf13GFCK1-IC&amp;pg=PA156&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite gumlao situation is that of a more democratic and flexible system and emerges when chiefs and/or aristocrats are led to repudiate [[Kachin people|Kachin]] social rules, especially patrilineal ultimogeniture, partly due to the influence of the [[Shan people|Shan]], who do not employ this mode of inheritance. [[Shan people|Shan]] succession rules, "though somewhat vague, appear to favour primogeniture -at least in theory. Thus although, from certain aspects, the gumsa system can be regarded as modelled after a Shan pattern, the gumsa chief whose status and power begins to approach that of a Shan saohpa is led to repudiate principles which are fundamental to the gumsa system".&lt;ref&gt;Political Systems of Highland Burma: A Study of Kachin Social Structure Written By E.

The [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] were socially stratified. Bruce Elliott Johansen wrote in "The Encyclopedia of Native American Legal Tradition":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Northwest Coast culture stretched from the Alaska Panhandle to the northwest coast of present day California. Members of Northwest Coast nations built large, substantial houses for extended families from massive beams taken from the tall timber of the coast. ... Rank and status permeated nearly every facet of their lives, even dictating what portion of a house a given person occupied. The class system was hereditary as well. The class structure was fixed in time, handed down in temporal lockstep by the rules of primogeniture, the passage of rights and property to the firstborn son. Northwest Coast peoples recognized three classes that seemed as imperishable as the red cedar from which they constructed their lodges: nobility, commoners, and slaves. The nobility comprised chiefs and their closest relatives; the eldest son was the family head. He, his family, and a few associates lived in the rear right-hand corner of the house, abutted by people of lower status. These people were said to be "under the arm" of the chief. The next highest-ranking chief, usually a younger brother of the head chief, invariably occupied the rear left-hand corner of the house, with his family. He, too, had a number of people "under the arm". the other two corners were occupied by lesser chiefs' families. The space between the corners, along the walls, was used by commoners' families and a few very junior-ranking nobility. They were called "tenants", while the nobility in the corners reserved the right to ownership of the house. ... Slaves had no designated lodgings or rights; they were captured in raids on other peoples along the coast and were sometimes traded for other slaves or goods. A noble in one village could be captured and sols into slavery in another. the captive's relatives might then mount a counter-raid to free him. A person also could fall into slavery because of accumulated unpaid debts".&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Native American Legal Tradition edited by Bruce Elliott Johansen https://books.google.com/books?id=-hKB7AmyP5cC&amp;pg=PA228&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Raymond J. DeMallie and Alfonso Ortiz wrote in "North American Indian Anthropology: Essays on Society and Culture": "Among some Coast Salish, particularly those on Vancouver Island and the Straits Salish, the kinship system contained a potential basis for primogeniture. For example, separate terms for the oldest child existed in some societies. Also, the term for younger sibling was used as synonymous for members of junior lines (i.e., the children of siblings younger than the parents). This pattern was reflected to some extent in behavior. Barnett (1955:250-51), speaking about the Coast Salish of British Columbia, says that the oldest son would inherit the name (presumably the most distinguished name belonging to the family). Summing up the emphasis on primogeniture, Barnett states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Rank depended, not alone upon birth in a certain family, but also upon the order of birth within it. Within any given family, the possession of valuable items and resources of wealth and of ceremonial preprogatives was the important criterion of status. As a rule, this correlated paripassu with order of birth, for in general all rights were inherited. A fifth son in an aristocratic family therefore ranked far below the first, and his first cousin far below him (1955:247)".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Note that the "resources of wealth" included the title to lands such as fishing sites and ownership of such food-getting devices such as sturgeon nets. The oldest son was expected to share lands belonging to the family with other members, but he was in control of those lands and directed their use. Where family masks, dances, and other privileges were concerned, he decided when and under what circumstances they could be used".&lt;ref&gt;North American Indian Anthropology: Essays on Society and Culture edited by Raymond J.

William C. Sturtevant wrote about the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nootka]] in "Handbook of North American Indians: Northwest Xoast":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Kinship and hereditary rank were fundamental in the organization of Nootkan society. Kinship terminology is lineal in parents' generation and Hawaiian in ego's generation, consistent with ambilineal descent and the option to shift residence. The generations are consistently distinguished, and within ego's generation, senior and junior lines are distinguished. Parents' older and younger siblings' children are called by the terms used for own older and younger siblings, and the distinction continues in subsequent generations, so that an old man might call a boy 'older brother' if the boy's grandparent was the older sibling of his own grandparent. This usage is consistent with the importance of primogeniture. Brother and sister treated one another with reserve, especially while unmarried. Those called brother and sister could not marry, even if remote cousins, but if kinship was so remote that links could not be traced it was possible "to marry one's own", usually to get back hereditary rights that had left a descent line. Parent-child relations were close, and grandparent-grandchild especially close, as children often stayed with grandparents. Aunts and uncles were like parents, and one helped oneself to their things without asking. With parents-in-law there was great familiarity. Step-father and step-daughter kept their distance. Descent was ambilateral and kinship traced in any line allowed an individual to claim membership in more than one local group. Residence with a given group activated membership in it as a kinsman, and while there the individual gave it his loyalty and participated in its activities. Although residence was mainly patrilocal, in the long run there was no set rule. People were constantly moving between groups. Rank was closely linked with kinship, positions, such as chief, being inherited by primogeniture. A chief (the native term, hawii, also means 'wealthy upper class') was simply the highest-ranking member of a kin group of whatever level. Rank was founded on inherited rights called tupa'ti, thought of as property, which governed the ownership and use of practically everything of value. Tupa'ti, depending on their nature, could be inherited by an eldest son, shared by several children, held by an eldest daughter until her marriage and then transferred to her brother, or given to a son-in-law as common alternatives. There was a sense of patrimony of rights in a local group to be kept as intact as possible as it passed down through successive chiefs. The inheritance of tupa'ti tended to be through males. Over generations a number of descent lines developed in a group in a ranked relationship made explicit at feasts and potlatches in the order of seating, serving, and gift receiving. Rank was also constantly embodied in the place occupied in the big house. The top chief and house owner occupied the right rear (right for one facing the entrance), the next in rank, a brother or other close kinsman, the left rear. In between might be the head's married sons. Left and right front corners belonged to the third and fourth ranked. Middle sides could be for fifth and sixth ranked. Such interior locations were hereditarily owned. By the entrance were the slaves, mostly war captives, who were significant as trade objects, protective attendants, and even sacrificial victims. Commoners (were either those living with a chief, often quite close relatives, or less definitely associated transients along the sides. They always belonged to some chief who addressed them as kin. Even secondary chiefs were mascim (commoner) to a head chief. Although rank was graded continuously, an upper stratum could be distinguished consisting of indisputable chiefs with potlacht seats and titles to resource sites plus closely associated supporters, generally immediate relatives. Chiefs were the nuclei of Nootkan society; they owned practically everything and ideally did not work but directed followers. A chief and his family wore richer dress, abalone and dentallum ornaments, sea otter or fur-trimmed robes, and decorated rain hats and owned powerful symbols. For the use of resource sites the chief collected a tribute in kind, of no fixed amount, with which he could give a feast. However, big sea or land mammals belomged to the hunter who gave a feast with his catch. A chief's sons and younger brothers were subsidiary chiefs, war chiefs, and speakers, but the eldest son nominally took the top position while still a youth to ensure succession, the father continuing to actually run affairs. Some younger brothers of chiefs became independent chiefs through conquest of other groups. Other avenues to chiefship were potlatching or marriage to a woman of high rank. A chief and his more distantly related commoners were interdependent, the maintenance of his high standing resting on the support of the commoners, who in return had their children named ceremonially, were assisted in marriages, often lent privileges for social use and even granted minor rights. The chief of a group was regarded as a father looking after his children, authoritarian but beneficent".&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of North American Indians: Northwest coast edited by William C.

Irving Goldman thought that the [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] could be related to the [[Polynesians]]. He wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"For reasons that remain to be discovered, the Indian tribes of this area [NW Coast] share formal principles of rank, lineage, and kinship with Pacific islanders. The Kwakiutl, especially, seem very close to what I have designated as the "traditional" Polynesian society. They share with Polynesians a status system of graded hereditary ranking of individuals and of lineages; a social class system of chiefs ("nobles"), commoners, and slaves; concepts of primogeniture and seniority of descent lines; a concept of abstract supernatural powers as special attributes of chiefs; and a lineage system that leans toward patriliny, but acknowledges the maternal lines as well. Finally, Kwakiutl and eastern Polynesians, especially, associate ambiguity of lineage membership with "Hawaiian" type kinship, a fully classificatory system that does not distinguish between maternal and paternal sides, or between siblings and cousins".

Thomas Allan Abercrombie discusses the ayllu extensively as it exists today among the Aymara people in "THE POLITICS OF SACRIFICE: AN AYMARA COSMOLOGY IN ACTION": "The ranking of ayllus is (and was?) performed in an idiom derived from what is ... a central and divisive cleavage in the nature of the domestic group, birth order among siblings, who are contrasted not only by age but by their differing rights to leadership roles, fiesta-cargo offices, and property. ... Patrilines are not mere aggregates of patronym possessing men and their families, juxtaposed only because of rights in land. Rather, they are structured, internally hierarchical social units, in which collective action is both enabled by, and enables the creation of, formally recognized positions of authority.`... Within the "patristem family" -a group of brothers who have constructed houses around the patio of their father—authority is vested in the father until his death. Afterwards, however, it is the eldest brother, the jiliri or jiliri jilata, who is regarded as becoming the kamachiri. This works out at the level of the sibling group, but what about the group of patristem units, some with nearest linking ancestors beyond the reach of memory? There exists a notion of an informal collective body of jiliris within the hamlet and patriline which can act as a sole council of elders. On close inspection, however, it turns out that these jiliris are neither equal in status nor necessarily eldest brothers within their own patri-stem sibling groups! In fact, jiliri status outside the patristem unit (and this unit begins to fragment after the death of the father of the sibling group) depends on the combination of appropriate "leaderly" personal qualities and the individual's status in the "elder brother and herder-making" system of public ritual careers. Moreover, greatest authority, that accompanied by the power to impose sanctions by force, is said to reside in a body of officials known as the jach'a íilírís. the "great eldest brothers," that is, in ayllu level authorities also known as alcaldes, alguaciles, and íaías. It is almost certain that the name for this last office (the highest ranking of the three), is derived from the root jila, from which both jilata ("brother") and jiliri ("eldest" or "first [born]") are derived. The patrilineal hamlet as well as ayllu authority is also designated by terms related to herding roles. First, he is compared to the lead animal of the herd, the llantiru (from Sp.delantero, "one who goes before"). Secondly, he is known as the patriline's or ayllu's awatiri (herder), in which capacity the group which recognizes his authority becomes his rama (herd).... Upon his death, the sullk'iri may inherit the house and herd, but it is to the eldest son, not the youngest, that the status of kamachiri falls. And his comnmand extends into serious matters such as the allocation of lands and pastures within the sibling group, control over fallowing cycles, decisions about the opening of new fields (which may lead to warfare with neighboring groups), and the timing/itinerary of collective caravan expeditions to the valleys. In addition, it is the kamachiri who controls important ritual matters (related to herd fertility) which take place at the very altars he does not inherit. ... Like the llama llantiru, the role of eldest brother and the authorities who are called iilírí encode a principle of reproduction. First, as authority at the level of hamnlet, patriline, ayllu, and moiety, the jiliri conjoins the particular domestic groups of a hamlet ando patriline, the patrilines of the ayllu, and the ayllus of a moiety, by standing to all in an equivalent transitive relationship. The sullk'iri, on the other hand, reaps the rewards of inheritance, but is thereby irrevocably identified with the continuity of a particular household-that of his father—rather than with its reproduction. Like the llama-llantiru, the jiliri-llantíru owes his dominant position to control over herds, but here we refer to both animal and human ones. Unlike the youngest brother in the sibling group, who remains essentially a social extension of the father and a permanent dependant, the eldest brother receives the father's "command" (kamachiri), though he is exiled from his father's house and (to a degree) disinherited from his herd. His authority is, in fact, closely connected to his outward-directedness. The eldest brother could be said to be autonomous and self-generating-by establíshing his own house and herd, he is the embodiment not of the continuity of a house and herd (like the sullk'iri), but of the principle of reproduction of the very unit he is excluded from. As such, within and outside the patrigroup the jiliri also embodies the fertility (that is, the expansion) and generativity of the patriline. Like the llama llantiru, the jiliri-llantiru is associated with the conjunction of disparate herds in a new, unified herd. The jiliri's actual leadership role within the sibling group and patronymic hamlet amplifies these associations. The jiliri's "command" extends from the role of arbiter in intra-sibling group disputes, to that of leader of the conjoined brothers in disputes with other sibling groups within the hamlet or patriline. In addition, it is the jiliri who, stereotypically, decides when and where to go on annual trading trips, and conjoins multiple herds to make up the large caravan needed for a successful trip. it is men who are (or are becoming) jiliris who are the most likely to be able to establish a conjoint herd, garner sufficient labor, and otherwise mount a successful trade expedition. Such expeditions are crucially important source of foodstuffs, and are refracted within the collective ritual sphere in an inverse type of caravan trade (carrying foodstuffs to the ayllu-and moiety level "ladder" of the town for the fiesta, and returning empty-handed to the hamlet) through which the status of jach'ajiliri is achieved. But it is not only in his capacity to circulate foodstuffs that the stature of the jiliri is achieved, but in an attendant control over the circulation of the generative substances blood (wila) and fat (as a kind of solidified muju) among the human and animal, and the earthly and otherworldly realms. The point is not that only jiliris establish independent, conjoint households and herds, but that the opposed attributes of youngest and eldest brothers make them appropriate vehicles for representing two opposed facets of the household and herd: the fírst (typified by the youngest brother in dependant filial roles) is its continuity per se, as a particular unit; the second (typified by the eldest brother in independent founding-pater role) the general model or generative principIe of the household and herd as a type of social arrangement produced by, and reproducing, the patriline. Once he has begun his career, or continued an inherited one, the sponsor-jiliri joins the ranks of patriline-hamlet "fathers" and "elder brothers", and with it takes on, at the inter-domestic group level, what was, in the domestic group, the leadership roles of elder brother and father. This role is, of course, a function of the sponsor's "outward directedness", expressed in his ritual duties but represented as well in the terms of the asymmetric relations among exogamous patrilines within the ayllu. Patriline jiliris, like jilaqatas, are made, not born. But they are made in the image of the "self made man" of K'ulta society, the eldest sons, who must build their households themselves through the control they achieve of herds and alliances. Marriage is but the fírst step towards becoming a collective elder brother, herd-leader, and herder of men. The asymmetrical nature of marriage alliances, however, does not make a man into a herder of men, but a subordinate member of the herds of his wife's brother and wife's father, and he will remain thus subordinated until he turns the relation on its head by becoming a herder of his own sisters' and daughters' husbands. Accomplishing this involves withholding one's children's inheritance and "seniority" as long as possible, just as it requires establishing oneself in the status of superior among equals among one's own sibling group".&lt;ref&gt;THE POLITICS OF SACRIFICE: AN AYMARA COSMOLOGY IN ACTION BY THOMAS ALAN ABERCROMBIE http://www.ucb.edu.bo/BibliotecaAymara/docsonline/pdf/925009654.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Amazonia the conical clan survived the conquest and could be researched in situ by anthropologists. Michael J. Heckenberger writes about the xinguanos in "The Enigma of the Great Cities: Body and State in Amazonia":

"Hierarchical social relationships are described in terms of the degree of respect or "shame", ihuse (to be in a state of deference or "shame" [ihuse-ndagu] to a social superior), that one individual has for another. ... Children and their spouses are ihuse-ndagu to their parents and parents-inlaw, wives are to their husbands, younger siblings are to elder siblings, and, most notably in the present context, commoners are to the primary chiefs. This relationship is metaphorically represented in chiefly discourses where community members are called "my children", "my sons", or simply "children .... Structurally hierarchy is based on primogeniture within an otherwise cognatic kinship system, whereby the higher ranking individuals derive status form their relative position in the chiefly hierarchy. More or less similar structural patterns, variably referred to as status lineages, conical clans, or house societies, have been identified for a wide range of moderately stratified societies. It is typically the case in these other hierarchical societies that the temporal extension of birth order ranking is branching, what Firth (1936) called ramification, whereby chiefly lines (e.g., the oldest sons of oldest sons) become separated from subordinate lines (the youngest sons of youngest sons). Such a structure of hierarchically organized kin groups simultaneously divides society into upper strata (chiefs) and lower strata (non chiefs) while incorporating both in a unified structure".

The [[Tukanoan]] "are patrilineal and exogamous: individuals belong to their father's group and speak his language but must marry partners from other groups who speak other languages. Externally, groups are equal but different; internally each is made up of a number of named clans ranked in a hierarchy. The ancestors of these clans were the sons of the Anaconda-ancestor and their birth order, the order of emergence from their father's body, determines their position: higher ranking clans are collectively "elder brothers to those below. Clan rank is correlated with status and prestige and loosely correlated with residence: higher ranking clans tend to live in favoured downstream locations with lower ranking clans often living upstream or in headwater areas. Clan rank also has ritual correlates: top ranking clans, the "head of the Anaconda", are "chiefs" or "headmen" who control the group's dance ornaments and Yuruparí and sponsor major rituals; middle ranking clans are specialist dancers and chanters; below them come shamans; and at the bottom are servant clans, the "tail of the Anaconda", who are sometimes identified with the semi-nomadic "Makú" (A pejorative term with connotations of 'servant, slave, uncivilised, etc." ) who live in the interfluvial zones. This hierarchy of specialised roles and ritual prerogatives is most evident during collective rituals where genealogies are recited and where relations of rank and respect are emphasised. In a more subtle way, it is also reflected in everyday life. The inhabitants of a maloca are typically a group of closely related men, the children of the same father or of two or more brothers, who live together with their wives and children. When a woman marries, she leaves her natal maloca and goes to live with her husband. In symbolic terms, the maloca replicates the world in miniature and the maloca community is a both a replication and a future precursor of the ideal clan organisation described above. Here the father of the maloca community would be the Anaconda-ancestor of the whole group and his sons the ancestors of its component clans. In real life too, the eldest son and senior brother is typically the maloca headman and quite often his younger brothers are dancers, chanters or shamans, sometimes in appropriate order of birth".&lt;ref&gt;http://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/bara/1382&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Hugh-Jones writes about the [[Tukanoan]] in "Clear Descent or Ambiguous Houses ? A Re-Examination of Tukanoan Social Organisation": "Horizontal affinal exchanges between different groups have their complement in the vertical or hierarchical ordering of agnatic relations within each one. Each group, descended from an anaconda ancestor, is divided into a number of clans or sibs ranked according to the birth order of their founding ancestors, the anaconda's sons. Members of a given sib refer to other sibs as their elder or younger brothers. In theory, each sib should live in a single communal long-house or maloca; in practice the residence group typically consists of a sib-segment or minimal lineage, a group of brothers living with their parents and their in-married wives. The maloca community is the minimal exogamic unit and residence is virilocal: on marriage, wives move in whilst sisters move out. Tukanoan life is river oriented; in theory, and to some extent in practice, sib rank is reflected in spatial organisation. Senior sibs live downstream relative to junior sibs who live towards the headwaters. ... The headman and owner of the house is normally the eldest brother. He is treated with a certain amount of deference and has his compartment on the right hand side furthest to the rear; the compartments of married younger brothers are further towards the front whilst both unmarried youths and guests sleep near the front door. Each family represents a potential household and, in the end, tensions between them (typically over food, sex and authority) lead to the break-up of the group. ... Groups are divided into one or more sets of sibs internally ranked as elder/ younger brother as if the component sibs were a group of male siblings, the sons of the anaconda father. Sets of sibs, ideally numbering five (as in the primal house), claim specialised roles as their ritual prerogatives: the top sib are chiefs followed by chanter-dancers, warriors, shamans and servants in that order; in any given area, not all these roles are necessarily represented by extant sibs. Thought this caste-like division is expressed at sib level during ritual, in daily practice it operates only at an individual level. Male children should be given a name appropriate to their birth order and linked with the ritual role which they should adopt in adult life. In practice, the eldest brother is indeed usually the maloca headman and his younger siblings may also specialise as dancers, chanters and shamans according to seniority"&lt;ref&gt;Clear Descent or Ambiguous Houses ? A Re-Examination of Tukanoan Social Organisation Stephen Hugh-Jones&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean Elizabeth Jackson wrote the following about the Tukanoan people in "The Fish People: Linguistic Exogamy and Tukanoan Identity in Northwest Amazonia": "Vaupés sibs (clans) are named, ranked, exogamous, localized patrilineal descent groups. ... Sibs are named, and these names often refer to plant or animals. Sib names can also refer to sib ancestors and their immediate descendants; this is also true for the personal names owned by each sib. These personal names are given to infants in a prescribed order. The eldest son of the headman ideally is the first-born male of his generation and receives the first name on the list. This sib-supplied name fosters growth, for it associates the newborn child with a nurturing group of agnatic kinsmen. The infant becomes more human upon receiving a name, for it is an explicit affirmation of membership in the sib, entitling it to the power and nurturance available from the ancestors. ... The sibs in a given language group are ranked. The order of ranking is explained as corresponding to the order in which a group of brothers, the ancestors of the various sibs, emerged from the rocks at a particular rapids site. ... The ranking of sibs is continued today with the use of elder-younger sibling terms between members of different sibs. However, in some language groups the difference in rank between certain pair of sibs is so great that generational divisions are brought into play. This results in an unusual and initially surprising usage of cognatic terminology. A person who belongs to a considerably higher ranked sib than another will address the other as "uncle" or "grandfather". This seemingly incongruous state of affairs is explained by Tukanoans as follows: The first ancestors of all the sibs of one language group were brothers to one another. The eldest brother emerged from the rocks at the rapids first, and the youngest last. However, there were many brothers in the beginning, and obviously there were many years between the birth of the eldest and the youngest brother. By the time the youngest brother emerged at the rapids, the eldest was very old, and had great-grandchildren. Thus, although the eldest and youngest brothers called each other "brother"; because many years had passed between their births the younger brothers were addressing as "grandchild" those individuals in the eldest brother's sib who were close to them in age. This is why, today, when people of about the same age are heard using grandparent and grandchild terms to each other, it is the one who says "grandfather" and who is called "grandson" who is of higher rank. Sib rank is signaled in other ways as well. One method of indicating a sib's ver low rank is to impugn its origins with the claim that it is a "new" member of the language group, "who were our servants, who had to be taught how to build houses and speak our language. Then, taking pity on them, we adopted them as our youngest-brother sib."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PtdzeLF53zcC|title=The Fish People: Linguistic Exogamy and Tukanoan Identity in Northwest Amazonia|last=Jackson|first=Jean Elizabeth|date=1983-09-30|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521278225|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robin M. Wright writes about the [[Baniwa]] in "Umawali. Hohodene myths of the Anaconda, father of the fish: "[[Baniwa]] society is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} some six exogamous phratries, each consisting of 4-5 patrilineal sibs ranked according to the order of emergence of mythical ancestral brothers. Like their Tukanoan neighbors, sibs were once categorized (the system has suffered numerous changes due to a situation of permanent contact) according to a system of ritual roles as ciefs (enawinai), shamans, warriors, dancers, and servants (makuperi). ... The core of local communities is the male sibling group and, as on the phratric end sib level, male sibling ties form the basis of a system of hierarchical rank according to relative age. Traditionally, the agnatic sibling group of a community constituted the most important level of decision-making. Leadership is often exercised by the eldest brother of the local group. Oral histories indicate that warfare was an important dynamic in socio-political relations with Tukanoan and Maku peoples of the Uaupés, and that war chiefs frequently organized communities of younger-brother warrior sibs to conduct campaigns for the purposes of undertaking vengeance and capturing women and children. Warfare also has a fundamental importance in mythology".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ssa-sag.ch/bssa/pdf/bssa57-58_05.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gê-speaking peoples of the Amazonia were also organized in conical clan similar to those described above.

Some isolated lowland tribes of Central and South America have also preserved the conical clan as their form of social organization. Such is the case of the [[Koji people|Koji]] people of [[Colombia]].

In the [[South Cone]], ranking by patrilineal primogeniture prevailed among the [[Mapuche]].&lt;ref&gt;Expanding the View of Hohokam Platform Mounds: An Ethnographic Perspective Written By Mark D. Elson, Mark (Mark D.) Elson https://books.google.com/books?id=CI_n9GkvitwC&amp;pg=PA44&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other peoples ==

C. Scott Littleton has suggested that ranking by patrilineal [[ultimogeniture]] could have prevailed in [[Proto-Indo-European society]]. He wrote the following in "The New Comparative Mythology: An Anthropological Assessment of the Theories of George Dumezil":
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Gerschel published, in 1956, a most interesting, albeit exploratory, paper. Entitled "Sur un schème trifonctionnel dans une famille de légendes germaniques", the paper is concerned with the possible existence of a tripartite scheme in a series of German and Swiss legends wherein a man or a woman performs some service for the "little people" (fairies, elves, etc.) and, in return, receives three gifts (e.g., a ring, a sword, and a loaf of bread) which are to be passed on to the three sons. So long as these three items are preserved, the three branches of the family will prosper. These gifts, of course, are seen by Gerschel as symbolic of the three functions, and the prosperity of the three sons so endowed varies accordingly: the eldest son receives a gift symbolizing the third function (e.g., a loaf of bread; cf. the third function identification of Lipoxaïs, eldest son of the Scythian Targitaos) and becomes a successful farmer and the father of many children; the second son receives a gift symbolic of the second function (e.g., a sword) and becomes a successful warrior; the youngest son receives a gift symbolic of the first function (e.g., a ring or a cup) and becomes a priest, an abbot, or the governor of a province. Should these objects be lost or destroyed, then the three branches of the family will cease to prosper in their respective ways. Often the first and second sons lose their talismans, while the youngest, who holds the gift symbolizing sovereignty, is able to preserve his by sequestering it in an abbey and thus continues to prosper. Gerschel concludes that these modern (fifteenth-to eighteenth century) South German and Swiss legends, many of which are tied to existing families in the area and are used to explain the differing fortunes of various branches thereof, "sont susceptibles de récéler une matière d' origine indo-européenne: la légende est ici héritière du mythe" (1956, p.&amp;nbsp;92). This interpretation, if correct, is, in my opinion, of the highest significance; it implies that the tripartite ideology has persisted far beyond the phase in which epics were composed, that it trascended the era of classical historical interpretation, and that, despite well over a thousand years of Christianity, it still forms a part of the European world view (at least in Bavaria and some Swiss cantons). As I see it, even if these legends are but isolated examples, Gerschel's work, coupled with that of Dumézil, opens up some most interesting avenues of research, ones that have perhaps some important theoretical implications as far as the relationships among language, society, and ideology are concerned. Another matter that this article brings into focus is the extent to which Proto I-E society was characterized by ultimogeniture. I have alluded above to Lipoxaïs, who, as the eldest son, received the lowest rank; conversely, his youngest brother Kolaxaïs became sovereign. In these German and Swiss legends, the same thing happens. Elsewhere the evidence is not clear-cut, but hints of ultimogeniture can be found throughout ancient I-E literature. One such example can be seen in the kinship in heaven theme mentioned previously in my discussion of Wikander's work; here again, the youngest son inherits the sovereign position (cf. the positions of Zeus, Feridun, Tesub, etc., relative to their respective siblings). That this was indeed the Proto I-E pattern is still an open question, but I feel that a good case for it can be made on the basis of the evidence presented above".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f8g1P7pnOIwC|title=The New Comparative Mythology: An Anthropological Assessment of the Theories of Georges Dumézil|last=Littleton|first=C. Scott|date=1973-01-01|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520024038|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is possible that even the Proto-Germanic word for "king" (kuningaz) derived initially from the word for "youngest son" (see [[Rígsþula]]).

On the other hand, Gilman's concept of "Germanic societies", characterized by "1) the autonomy of households (which are the basic units of production); 2) the coalition of households that makes up the community, which takes the form of tribal assemblies with authority in matters of war, religion, and legal disputes; and 3) hereditary leadership of the assembly's military and judicial activities"&lt;ref&gt;Atlantic Europe in the First Millennium BC: Crossing the Divide edited by Tom Moore, Xosê-Lois Armada https://books.google.com/books?id=fQxz_4Mp1gYC&amp;pg=PA267&lt;/ref&gt; is opposite to the conical clan model. Gilman included in his category of "Germanic societies" some societies from East Africa and the Near East, unrelated to Germanic peoples from an ethnic or linguistic point of view but similar in their form of social organization (this concept originated from studies of the early forms of social organization in [[La Mancha]], Spain). This form of social organization has also been called "[[segmentary lineage]] model", and prevailed mostly among Semitic peoples, such as Arabs or ancient Israelites, but also among [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] societies, Slavic societies, [[Tai peoples|Tai]] societies and some societies from East Africa such as the Nuer, whom Evans-Pritchard studied extensively. [[Pashtun society]] is nowadays the largest society of this kind. In this model of social organization, every member of a society claims descent from a common ancestor, but all lines of descent are considered equal, not ranked.

[[File:Tea Tax Tempest.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Guttenberg]]'s 1778 ''Tea-Tax Tempest'', with exploding teapot'']]
'''Tempest in a teapot''' ([[American English]]), or '''storm in a teacup''' ([[British English]]), is an [[idiom]] meaning a small event that has been exaggerated out of proportion. There are also lesser known or earlier variants, such as ''tempest in a teacup'', ''storm in a cream bowl'', ''tempest in a glass of water'', ''storm in a wash-hand basin'',&lt;ref&gt;Christine Ammer, ''The American Heritage dictionary of idioms'', p. 647, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1997 {{ISBN|0-395-72774-X}}, 9780395727744&lt;/ref&gt; and ''storm in a glass of water''.

== Etymology ==

[[Cicero]], in the first century BC, in his ''[[De Legibus]]'', used a similar phrase in Latin, possibly the precursor to the modern expressions, "''Excitabat enim fluctus in simpulo ut dicitur Gratidius''", translated: "For Gratidius raised a tempest in a ladle, as the saying is".&lt;ref name=Reddall&gt;{{cite book|last=Reddall|first=Henry Frederic|title=Fact, fancy, and fable: a new handbook for ready reference on subjects commonly omitted from cyclopaedias|year=1892|publisher=A.C McClurg|page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in the early 3rd century AD, [[Athenaeus]], in the ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'', has Dorion ridiculing the description of a tempest in the ''Nautilus'' of Timotheus by saying that he had seen a more formidable storm in a boiling saucepan.&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=John|title=Familiar quotations: a collection of passages, phrases, and proverbs traced to their sources in ancient and modern literature|year=1891|publisher=Little, Brown, and company|page=767}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase also appeared in its French form "une tempête dans un verre d'eau" (a tempest in a glass of water), to refer to the popular uprising in the Republic of Geneva near the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref name=Lippincott&gt;{{cite journal|title=Whence the phrase "a tempest in a teapot"?|journal=Lippincott's monthly magazine: a popular journal of general literature|date=March 1889|volume=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

One of the earliest occurrences in print of the modern version is in 1815, where Britain's [[Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow|Lord Chancellor Thurlow]], sometime during his tenure of 1783–1792, is quoted as referring to a popular uprising on the [[Isle of Man]] as a "tempest in a teapot".&lt;ref name=Kett&gt;{{cite book|last=Kett|first=Henry|title=The flowers of wit, or, A choice collection of bon mots, both antient and modern, with biographical and critical remarks, Volume 2|year=1814|publisher=Lackington, Allen, and co|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]], Prime Minister of Great Britain, is credited for popularizing this phrase as characterizing the outbreak of American colonists against the [[tea tax|tax on tea]].&lt;ref name=Hartford&gt;{{cite journal|title=''A Tempest in a Teapot''|journal=Hartford Herald|date=July 10, 1907|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment was then satirized in Carl Guttenberg's 1778 engraving of the ''Tea-Tax Tempest'' (shown above right), where Father Time flashes a [[magic lantern]] picture of an exploding teapot to America on the left and Britannia on the right, with British and American forces advancing towards the teapot.  Just a little later, in 1825, in the Scottish journal ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'', a critical review of poets Hogg and Campbell also included the phrase "tempest in a teapot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blackwood|first=William|title=Scotch Poets, Hogg and Campbell|journal=Blackwood's Edinburgh magazine|year=1825|volume=17|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nItIAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;ots=uIQpnu05CX&amp;dq=Blackwood's%20Edinburgh%20Magazine%20%22tempest%20in%20a%20teapot%22&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
 
The first recorded instance of the British English version, "storm in teacup", occurs in Catherine Sinclair's ''Modern Accomplishments'' in 1838.&lt;ref name="Phrase Finder"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tempest in a teapot|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/tempest-in-a-teapot.html|work=The Phrase Finder|accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinclair|first=Catherine|title=Modern accomplishments ; or, The march of intellect|year=1836|publisher=Waugh and Innes|page=204|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8gwnAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22storm%20in%20a%20teacup%22&amp;pg=PA204#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several instances though of earlier British use of the similar phrase "storm in a wash-hand basin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Storm in a wash-hand basin (pre-1938)|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22storm+in+a+wash-hand+basin%22&amp;tbs=,cdr:1,cd_max:Dec%2031_2%201838&amp;num=10|work=Google Books search|accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''ternary relation''' or '''triadic relation''' is a [[finitary relation]] in which the number of places in the relation is three.  Ternary relations may also be referred to as '''3-adic''', '''3-ary''', '''3-dimensional''', or '''3-place'''.

Just as a [[binary relation]] is formally defined as a set of ''pairs'', i.e. a subset of the [[Cartesian product]] {{Nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}} of some sets ''A'' and ''B'', so a ternary relation is a set of triples, forming a subset of the Cartesian product {{Nowrap|''A'' × ''B'' × ''C''}} of three sets ''A'', ''B'' and ''C''.

An example of a ternary relation in elementary geometry can be given on triples of points, where a triple is in the relation if the three points are [[Collinearity|collinear]]. Another geometric example can be obtained by considering triples consisting of two points and a line, where a triple is in the ternary relation if the two points determine (are [[Incidence (geometry)|incident]] with) the line.

A function {{Nowrap|''ƒ'': ''A'' × ''B'' → ''C''}} in two variables, mapping two values from sets ''A'' and ''B'', respectively, to a value in ''C'' associates to every pair (''a'',''b'') in {{Nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}} an element ''ƒ''(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'') in&amp;nbsp;''C''. Therefore, its graph consists of pairs of the form {{Nowrap|((''a'', ''b''), ''ƒ''(''a'', ''b''))}}. Such pairs in which the first element is itself a pair are often identified with triples. This makes the graph of ''ƒ'' a ternary relation between ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'', consisting of all triples {{Nowrap|(''a'', ''b'', ''ƒ''(''a'', ''b''))}}, satisfying {{nowrap|''a'' in ''A''}}, {{nowrap|''b'' in ''B''}}, and {{nowrap|''ƒ''(''a'', ''b'') in ''C''.}}

===Cyclic orders===
{{Main article|Cyclic order}}

Given any set ''A'' whose elements are arranged on a circle, one can define a ternary relation ''R'' on ''A'', i.e. a subset of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = {{Nowrap|''A'' × ''A'' × ''A''}}, by stipulating that {{Nowrap|''R''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}} holds if and only if the elements ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are pairwise different and when going from ''a'' to ''c'' in a clockwise direction one passes through ''b''. For example, if ''A'' = { {{Nowrap|1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}} } represents the hours on a [[clock face]], then {{Nowrap|''R''(8, 12, 4)}} holds and {{Nowrap|''R''(12, 8, 4)}} does not hold.

===Betweenness relations===
{{Main article|Betweenness relation}}
{{Expand section|date=May 2011}}

===Congruence relation===
{{Main article|Congruence modulo m}}

The ordinary congruence of arithmetics
:&lt;math&gt; a \equiv b \pmod{m}&lt;/math&gt;
which holds for three integers ''a'', ''b'', and ''m'' if and only if ''m'' divides ''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b'', formally may be considered as a ternary relation.  However, usually, this instead is considered as a family of [[binary relation]]s between the ''a'' and the ''b'', indexed by the [[Modular arithmetic|modulus]] ''m''.  For each fixed ''m'', indeed this binary relation has some natural properties, like being an [[equivalence relation]]; while the combined ternary relation in general is not studied as one relation.

===Typing relation===
{{Main article|Simply typed lambda calculus#Typing rules}}

A ''typing relation'' &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash e\!:\!\sigma&lt;/math&gt; indicates that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is a term of type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; in context &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, and is thus a ternary relation between contexts, terms and types.

===Schröder rules===
A ternary relation &lt;math&gt;(A,\ B,\ C)&lt;/math&gt; can be defined in the [[category of relations|category of binary relations]] using [[composition of relations]] ''AB'' and [[inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]] ''AB'' ⊆ ''C''. Within the [[calculus of relations]] each relation ''A'' has a [[converse relation]] ''A''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; and a complement relation &lt;math&gt;\bar{A} .&lt;/math&gt; Using these [[involution (mathematics)|involution]]s, [[Augustus De Morgan]] and [[Ernst Schröder]] showed that &lt;math&gt;(A,\ B,\ C)&lt;/math&gt;is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(\bar{C}, B^T, \bar{A})&lt;/math&gt; and also equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(A^T,\  \bar{C},\  \bar{B}).&lt;/math&gt; The mutual equivalences of these forms, constructed from the ternary {{nowrap|relation (''A, B, C''),}} are called the [[composition of relations#Schröder rules| Schröder rules]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gunther Schmidt]] &amp; Thomas Ströhlein (1993) ''Relations and Graphs'', pages 15–19, [[Springer books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8436">The '''top type''' in the [[type theory]] of [[mathematics]], [[logic]], and [[computer science]], commonly abbreviated as '''top''' or by the ''down tack'' symbol (⊤), is the ''universal'' type, sometimes called the ''universal supertype'' as all other types in any given type system are [[subtype]]s of top. In most cases it is the type which contains every possible object in the type system of interest. It is in contrast with the [[bottom type]], or the ''universal subtype'', which every other type is supertype of and in most cases it is the type that contains no members at all.

==Support in programming languages==
Several typed [[programming language]]s provide explicit support for the top type.

In [[Type system#Static type checking|statically-typed]] languages, there are two different, often confused, concepts when discussing the top type.
# A ''universal base class'' or other item at the top of a [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]] ''class hierarchy'' (often relevant in [[object-oriented programming]]) or ''type hierarchy''; it is often possible to create objects with this (run time) type, or it could be found when one examines the type hierarchy programmatically, in languages that support it
# A ([[compile time]]) ''static type'' in the code whose variables can be assigned any value (or a subset thereof, like any object pointer value), similar to [[Type system#Dynamic type checking and run time type information|dynamic typing]]
The first concept often implies the second, i.e., if a universal base class exists, then a variable that can point to an object of this class can also point to an object of any class. However, several languages have types in the second regard above (e.g., &lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt; in C++, &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; in Objective-C, &lt;code&gt;interface {}&lt;/code&gt; in Go), static types which variables can accept any object value, but which do not reflect real run time types that an object can have in the type system, so are not top types in the first regard.

In dynamically-typed languages, the second concept does not exist (any value can be assigned to any variable anyway), so only the first (class hierarchy) is discussed. This article tries to stay with the first concept when discussing top types, but also mention the second concept in languages where it is significant.

The following object-oriented languages have no universal base class:
* [[C++]]. The ''pointer to void'' type can accept any non-function pointer, even though the [[void type]] itself is not the universal type but the [[unit type]].
* [[Objective-C]]. It is possible to create a new base class by not specifying a parent class for a class, although this is highly unusual. &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; is conventionally used as the base class in the original Objective-C run times. In the [[OpenStep]] and [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] Objective-C libraries, &lt;code&gt;NSObject&lt;/code&gt; is conventionally the universal base class. The top type for pointers to objects is &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;.
* [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]]. It is possible to create a new base class by not specifying a parent class for a class. The protocol &lt;code&gt;Any&lt;/code&gt; can accept any type.
* [[PHP]].

===Other languages===
Languages that are not object-oriented usually have no universal supertype, or subtype polymorphism support.

While [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] purposefully lacks subtyping, it has several other forms of polymorphism including [[parametric polymorphism]]. The most generic type class parameter is &lt;code&gt;forall a. a&lt;/code&gt;. Similarly in [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], &lt;code&gt;&lt;T: ?Sized&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the most generic parameter (&lt;code&gt;&lt;T&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is not, as it implies the &lt;code&gt;Sized&lt;/code&gt; trait).

The top type is used as a ''generic'' type, more so in languages without [[parametric polymorphism]].  For example, before introduing generics in [[Java 5]], collection classes in the Java library (excluding Java arrays) held references of type &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;. In this way, any non-intrinsic type could be inserted into a collection.  The top type is also often used to hold objects of unknown type.

In languages with a [[structural type system]], the top type is the empty structure. For example, objects in [[OCaml]] are structurally typed; the empty object type (the type of objects with no methods), &lt;code&gt;&lt; &gt;&lt;/code&gt;, is the top type of object types. Any OCaml object can be explicitly upcasted to this type, although the result would be of no use. [[Go (programming language)|Go]] also uses structural typing; and all types implement the empty interface: &lt;code&gt;interface {}&lt;/code&gt;.

The top type may also be seen as the implied type of non-statically typed languages.  Languages with run time typing often provide [[downcasting]] (or ''type refinement'') to allow discovering a more specific type for an object at run time.  In C++, downcasting from &lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt; cannot be done in a ''safe'' way, where failed downcasts are detected by the language run time.

== In logic ==
The notion of ''top'' is also found in [[propositional calculus]], corresponding to a formula which is true in every possible interpretation. It has a similar meaning in [[predicate calculus]]. In [[description logic]], top is used to refer to the set of all concepts. This is intuitively like the use of the top type in programming languages. For example, in the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL), which supports various description logics, top corresponds to the class &lt;code&gt;owl:Thing&lt;/code&gt;, where all classes are subclasses of &lt;code&gt;owl:Thing&lt;/code&gt;. (the bottom type or empty set corresponds to &lt;code&gt;owl:Nothing&lt;/code&gt;).

In 2006, the [[United States Department of Justice]] alleged in '''''United States v. Ike Brown''''' that the Noxubee County Democratic Executive Committee, in [[Noxubee County, Mississippi]], headed by Ike Brown, had violated the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] (VRA) with regards to the county's white minority. The suit alleged that Brown, the chairman of the Committee, had conspired to orchestrate "relentless racial discrimination" against white voters.&lt;ref name="nossiter"&gt;{{cite news|first=Adam|last=Nossiter|title=U.S. Says Blacks in Mississippi Suppress White Vote|work=The New York Times|date=2006-10-11|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/11/us/politics/11voting.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ari|last=Shapiro|title=White Voters in Mississippi Allege Voting Discrimination|work=National Public Radio|date=2005-11-14|format=audio|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5011333|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first time the VRA had been used to allege discrimination against whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=United States of America v.

On June 29, 2007, United States District Judge [[Tom S. Lee]] ruled that Brown (a twice-convicted felon), in conjunction with the Noxubee Democratic Executive Committee, had ''"manipulated the political process in ways specifically intended and designed to impair and impede participation of white voters and to dilute their votes."'' The 104-page opinion held that the Voting Rights Act is a colorblind statute and protects all voters from racial discrimination, regardless of the race of the voter. The Court ruled that the Noxubee County Democratic Party had an illegal intent to discriminate against white voters in violation of Section 2 of the VRA. 

The United States entered in a consent decree with the Noxubee County superintendent of general elections, administrator of absentee ballots, registrar, and the county government. The consent decree prohibited a wide range of discriminatory and illegal voting practices, and required these officials to report such incidents if they received information that they were continuing. This consent decree was approved by the district court and filed simultaneously with the filing of the complaint. Brown told ''The New York Times'' that he had not signed any such papers.&lt;ref name="nossiter"/&gt;

Wilson Company|isbn=0824207971|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Brombert was born in [[Berlin]] in 1923 into a well-to-do Russian-Jewish family that had fled Russia at the outbreak of the Revolution and settled in [[Leipzig]]. When Hitler came to power in Germany, the family left for Paris, and Brombert received his secondary education at the [[Lycée Janson-de-Sailly]]. As the German army advanced on Paris in 1940, the family fled to the unoccupied zone under the control of the Vichy government and a year later, in 1941, escaped via Spain to the United States.

In May 1943 Brombert was drafted into the U.S. army. Due to his fluency in French, German, and Russian he was placed in a special unit, composed chiefly of refugees from Nazi-occupied European countries, that was trained in front-line military intelligence at [[Fort Ritchie|Camp Ritchie, Maryland]], and featured in a documentary film "The [[Ritchie Boys]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0435725/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ritchieboys.com/EN/boys_brombert.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docurama.com/docurama/the-ritchie-boys/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.tvguide.com/The+Ritchie+Boys/The+Ritchie+Boys/8150782?autoplay=true&amp;partnerid=OVG]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 he took part in the Normandy landings with the 2nd Armored Division at [[Omaha Beach]] and also saw action with the 28th Infantry Division in the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. After the war, Brombert studied at Yale University, where he received a B.A. in 1948 and a Ph.D. in Romance Languages and Literatures in 1953. As a graduate student, he was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship (1950–51) to study in Rome, adding Italian to the languages in which he has native fluency. He is married to Beth Archer Brombert, a translator from French and Italian, and the author of the biographies ''Cristina: Portraits of a Princess'' and ''Édouard Manet: Rebel in a Frock Coat''. The Bromberts have two children, Lauren and Marc.

==Academic career==

On completion of his graduate studies Brombert joined the Yale Department of Romance Languages and Literatures. He was appointed Benjamin F. Barge Professor in 1968 and was chair of his Department from 1964 to 1973. In 1975 he moved to Princeton, where he had been appointed Henry Putnam University Professor and was affiliated with the Departments of Comparative Literature and Romance Languages and Literatures. At Princeton, he was also Director of Princeton's Christian Gauss Seminars in Criticism and chairman of its Council of the Humanities. He entered emeritus status in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.princeton.edu/fit/people/display_person.xml?netid=brombert Princeton biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brombert has been a visiting professor at many universities in the U.S. and Europe: the University of California (Berkeley), the Johns Hopkins University, Columbia University, New York University, the University of Colorado, the Scuola Normale Superiore (Pisa, Italy), the Collège de France (Paris), the University of Bologna, the University of Puerto Rico.

==Awards==

Brombert has held fellowships from the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (1967) and from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] (1954–55; 1970). He was [[Phi Beta Kappa]] Visiting Scholar in 1986-87 and 1989–90, and a scholar-in-residence at the Rockefeller Foundation in [[Bellagio, Italy]] in 1975 and in 1990. He was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1974, and to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1987. He holds honorary degrees from the [[University of Chicago]] (Doctor of Humane Letters, 1981) and the [[University of Toronto]] (Doctor of Laws, 1997). In 1985 he was awarded the Wilbur Cross Medal of the Yale Alumni Association for "distinguished achievements in scholarship, teaching, academic administration, and public service.” In France, he was honored with the Médaille Vermeil de la Ville de Paris " (1985) and was made ''[[Palmes Académiques|Commandeur des Palmes Académiques]]'' (2008) and ''[[Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur]]'' (2009).

In 1988-89 he served as president of the [[Modern Language Association]].

==Publications==

Brombert’s work is primarily on 19th and 20th century [[French literature]], and also on the [[history of ideas]]; the theory of literary criticism; and comparative studies of Italian, Russian, and German narrative writers. In addition to his books, he has contributed to edited volumes and written journal articles on French writers from Pascal to Malraux, Sartre, and Camus, and on many non-French writers: Dostoevsky, Gogol, Tolstoy; Büchner, Max Frisch, Kafka, Thomas Mann; Giorgio Bassani, Primo Levi, Italo Svevo; J. M. Coetzee, Virginia Woolf.

Brombert is also the author of a memoir, ''Trains of Thought: Memories of a Stateless Youth'' (New York: W.W. Norton, 2002; paperback, Anchor Books, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''Trains of Thought'' by [[Frank Kermode]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/sep/14/featuresreviews.guardianreview22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''Trains of Thought'' by [[Richard Howard]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/30/books/engine-of-escape.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently working on a sequel, to be entitled ''The Sabbatical Years''.
 
In the words of a reviewer in ''The Wall Street Journal'' (December 27, 2013), “Victor Brombert...has been for more than 50 years one of the glories of humanistic scholarship at Yale and Princeton. Though a generation younger than scholarly patriarchs like Erich Auerbach and Leo Spitzer, Mr. Brombert has nonetheless shown himself comparably learned and cosmopolitan in his studies...”

The lines running to the right are the tapes of genetic instructions, which are copied along with the body of the machines. The machine shown runs in a 32-state version of von Neumann's cellular automata environment, not his original 29-state specification.]]

[[John von Neumann]]'s '''universal constructor''' is a [[self-replicating machine]] in a [[cellular automata]] (CA) environment. It was designed in the 1940s, without the use of a computer. The fundamental details of the machine were published in von Neumann's book ''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata'', completed in 1966 by [[Arthur Burks|Arthur W. Burks]] after von Neumann's death.&lt;ref name=TSRA&gt;{{Citation| url=https://archive.org/details/theoryofselfrepr00vonn_0| title=''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata.''| author1=von Neumann, John| author2=Burks, Arthur W.| year=1966| publisher=University of Illinois Press| format=Scanned book online| archivedate=2015-06-24| accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Neumann's goal was to specify an abstract machine which, when run, would replicate itself. In his design, the machine consists of three parts: a 'blueprint' for itself, a mechanism that can read any blueprint and construct the machine (sans blueprint) specified by that blueprint, and a 'copy machine' that can make copies of any blueprint. After the mechanism has been used to construct the machine specified by the blueprint, the copy machine is used to create a copy of that blueprint, and this copy is placed into the new machine, resulting in a working replication of the original machine. Some machines will do this backwards, copying the blueprint and then building a machine.

To define his machine in more detail, von Neumann invented the concept of a cellular automaton. The [[Von Neumann cellular automaton|one he used]] consists of a two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which can be in one of 29 states at any point in time. At each timestep, each cell updates its state depending on the states of the surrounding cells at the prior timestep. The rules governing these updates are identical for all cells. 

The universal constructor is a certain pattern of cell states in this cellular automaton. It contains one line of cells that serve as a 'tape', encoding a sequence of instructions that serve as a 'blueprint' for the machine. The machine reads these instructions one by one and performs the corresponding actions. The instructions direct the machine to use its 'construction arm' to build a copy of the machine, without tape, at some other location in the cell grid. The tape can't contain instructions to build an equally long tape, just as a container can't contain a container of the same size. Therefore, the machine contains a separate 'copy machine' which reads the tape and places a copy into the newly constructed machine. The resulting new machine and tape is identical to the old one, and it proceeds to replicate again.

== Purpose ==

Von Neumann's design has traditionally been understood to be a demonstration of the logical requirements for machine self-replication.&lt;ref name=McMullin2000&gt;{{Citation|journal=Artificial Life|last=McMullin|first=B.|year=2000|title=John von Neumann and the Evolutionary Growth of Complexity: Looking Backwards, Looking Forwards...|volume=6|issue=4|pages=347–361|url=http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~alife/bmcm-alj-2000/|doi=10.1162/106454600300103674|pmid=11348586}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is clear that far simpler machines can achieve self-replication. Examples include trivial [[Crystal growth|crystal-like growth]], [[template replication]], and [[Langton's loops]]. But von Neumann was interested in something more profound: construction, universality, and evolution.&lt;ref name="walenz.org"&gt;[http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/page0110.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613231149/http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/page0110.html |date=June 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This universal constructor can be seen as an abstract [[simulation]] of a physical [[universal assembler]].

Note that the simpler self-replicating CA structures (especially, [[Byl's loop]] and the [[Chou–Reggia loop]]) cannot exist in a wide variety of forms and thus have very limited [[evolvability]]. Other CA structures such as the [[Evoloop]] are somewhat evolvable but still don't support open-ended evolution. Commonly, simple replicators do not fully contain the machinery of construction, there being a degree to which the replicator is information copied by its surrounding environment. Although the Von Neumann design is a logical construction, it is in principle a design that could be instantiated as a physical machine. The issue of the environmental contribution to replication is somewhat open, since there are different conceptions of raw material and its availability.

The concept of a ''universal constructor'' is non-trivial because of the existence of [[Garden of Eden (cellular automaton)|Garden of Eden patterns]]. But a simple definition is that a universal constructor is able to construct any finite pattern of non-excited (quiescent) cells.

Von Neumann's crucial insight is that part of the replicator has a double use; being both an active component of the construction mechanism, and being the target of a passive copying process. This part is played by the tape of instructions in Von Neumann's combination of universal constructor plus instruction tape.

The combination of a universal constructor and a tape of instructions would i) allow self-replication, and also ii) guarantee that the open-ended complexity growth observed in biological organisms was possible.&lt;ref name=McMullin2000/&gt; The image below illustrates this possibility.

This insight is all the more remarkable because it preceded the discovery of the structure of the DNA molecule by [[James Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]], though it followed the [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment]] which identified [[DNA]] as the molecular carrier of genetic information in living organisms.&lt;ref name=Rocha_lec_notes&gt;{{citation |last=Rocha|first=Luis M.|title=Lecture Notes of I-585-Biologically Inspired Computing Course, Indiana University|contribution=Von Neumann and Natural Selection.|url=http://informatics.indiana.edu/rocha/i-bic/pdfs/ibic_lecnotes_c6.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA molecule is processed by separate mechanisms that carry out its instructions and copy the DNA for insertion for the newly constructed cell. The ability to achieve open-ended evolution lies in the fact that, just as in nature, errors ([[mutations]]) in the copying of the genetic tape can lead to viable variants of the automaton, which can then evolve via [[Natural Selection|natural selection]].

[[Image:Pesavento replicator inherited mutations.png|thumb|center|700px|A demonstration of the ability of von Neumann's machine to support inheritable mutations. (1) At an earlier timestep, a mutation was manually added to the second generation machine's tape. (2) Later generations both display the [[phenotype]] of the mutation (a drawing of a flower) and pass the mutation on to their children, since the tape is copied each time. This example illustrates how von Neumann's design allows for complexity growth (in theory) since the tape could specify a machine that is more complex than the one making it.]]

== Implementations ==

[[Arthur Burks]] and others extended the work of von Neumann, giving a much clearer and complete set of details regarding the design and operation of von Neumann's self-replicator. The work of J. W. Thatcher is particularly noteworthy, for he greatly simplified the design. Still, their work did not yield a complete design, cell by cell, of a configuration capable of demonstrating self-replication.

[[Renato Nobili]] and Umberto Pesavento published the first fully implemented self-reproducing cellular automaton in 1995, nearly fifty years after von Neumann's work.&lt;ref name=Pesavento1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=NobiliPesavento1996&gt;{{Citation|last=Nobili|first=Renato|last2=Pesavento|first2=Umberto|contribution=Generalised von Neumann's Automata|title=Proc. Artificial Worlds and Urban Studies, Conference 1|year=1996|editor-last=Besussi|editor-first=E.|editor2-last=Cecchini|editor2-first=A.|location=Venice|publisher=DAEST|url=http://www.pd.infn.it/%7Ernobili/pdf_files/jvnconstr.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used a 32-state cellular automaton instead of von Neumann's original [[Von Neumann cellular automaton|29-state specification]], extending it to allow for easier signal-crossing, explicit memory function and a more compact design. They also published an implementation of a general constructor within the original 29-state CA but not one capable of complete replication - the configuration cannot duplicate its tape, nor can it trigger its offspring; the configuration can only construct.&lt;ref name=NobiliPesavento1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=Automata2008/&gt;

In 2004, D. Mange et al. reported an implementation of a self-replicator that is consistent with the designs of von Neumann.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE| title=A Macroscopic View of Self-replication| volume=92| issue=12| first=Daniel| last=Mange|last2=Stauffer|first2=A.|last3=Peparaolo|first3=L.|last4=Tempesti|first4=G.| pages=1929–1945| year=2004|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2004.837631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Nobili published a 32-state implementation that uses [[run-length encoding]] to greatly reduce the size of the tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pd.infn.it/~rnobili/wjvn/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 29, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129003524/http://www.pd.infn.it/~rnobili/wjvn/index.htm |archivedate=January 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, William R. Buckley published two configurations which are self-replicators within the original 29-state CA of von Neumann.&lt;ref name=Automata2008&gt;{{Citation|title=Proc. Automata 2008|contribution=Signal Crossing Solutions in von Neumann Self-replicating Cellular Automata| year=2008| first=William R.| last=Buckley|editor=[[Andrew Adamatzky]] |editor2=Ramon Alonso-Sanz |editor3=Anna Lawniczak |editor4=Genaro Juarez Martinez |editor5=Kenichi Morita |editor6=Thomas Worsch |pages=453–503|publisher=Luniver Press|url=http://uncomp.uwe.ac.uk/free-books/automata2008reducedsize.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buckley claims that the crossing of signal within von Neumann 29-state cellular automata is not necessary to the construction of self-replicators.&lt;ref name=Automata2008/&gt; Buckley also points out that for the purposes of evolution, each replicator should return to its original configuration after replicating, in order to be capable (in theory) of making more than one copy. As published, the 1995 design of Nobili-Pesavento does not fulfill this requirement but the 2007 design of Nobili does; the same is true of Buckley's configurations.

In 2009, Buckley published with [[Golly (program)|Golly]] a third configuration for von Neumann 29-state cellular automata, which can perform either holistic self-replication, or self-replication by partial construction.  This configuration also demonstrates that signal crossing is not necessary to the construction of self-replicators within von Neumann 29-state cellular automata.

C. L. Nehaniv in 2002, and also Y. Takada et al. in 2004, proposed a universal constructor directly implemented upon an asynchronous cellular automaton, rather than upon a synchronous cellular automaton.

As defined by von Neumann, universal construction entails the construction of passive configurations, only. As such, the concept of universal construction constituted nothing more than a literary (or, in this case, mathematical) device. It facilitated other proof, such as that a machine well constructed may engage in self-replication, while universal construction itself was simply assumed over a most minimal case. Universal construction under this standard is trivial. Hence, while all the configurations given here can construct any passive configuration, none can construct the real-time crossing organ devised by Gorman.&lt;ref name="Automata2008"/&gt;

== Practicality ==

=== Computational cost ===

All the implementations of von Neumann's self-reproducing machine require considerable resources to run on computer. For example, in the Nobili-Pesavento 32-state implementation shown above, while the body of the machine is just 6,329 non-empty cells (within a rectangle of size 97x170), it requires a tape that is 145,315 cells long, and takes 63 billion timesteps to replicate. A simulator running at 1,000 timesteps per second would take over 2 years to make the first copy. In 1995, when the first implementation was published, the authors had not seen their own machine replicate. However, in 2008, the [[hashlife]] algorithm was extended to support the 29-state and 32-state rulesets in [[Golly (program)|Golly]]. On a modern desktop PC, replication now takes only a few minutes, although a significant amount of memory is required.

=== Evolvability ===

It has been argued that the problem Von Neumann was trying to address was not self-reproduction ''per se'', but the evolutionary growth of complexity.&lt;ref name=McMullin2000/&gt; His “proof-of-principle” designs showed how it is logically possible, by using a general purpose programmable (“universal”) constructor, to exhibit an indefinitely large class of self-reproducing machines, spanning a wide range of “complexity” (in von Neumann's sense of “the ability to do complicated things”), interconnected by a network of potential mutational pathways, including pathways from the most simple to the most complex. This is an important result, as prior to that it might have been conjectured that there is a fundamental logical barrier to the existence of such pathways; in which case, biological organisms, which do support such pathways, could not be “machines”, as conventionally understood. But the result does not show what ''other'' conditions are necessary, in practice, for evolution along such pathways from simple to complex to be spontaneously realised or followed. In his unfinished work he briefly considers conflict and interactions between his self-reproducing machines;&lt;ref name="TSRA"/&gt;{{rp|147}} but in practice, his particular model cannot yield evolutionary dynamics because the machines are too fragile - the vast majority of perturbations cause them effectively to disintegrate.&lt;ref name=McMullin2000/&gt;

{{redirect|Win win}}
A '''win–win game''' is a [[game]] that, in game design or [[game theory]], is designed in a way that all participants can profit from it in one way or the other. In [[conflict resolution]], a '''win–win strategy''' is a collaborative strategy and conflict resolution process that aims to accommodate all participants.&lt;ref name=WWS-D-01/&gt;&lt;ref name=WWS-D-02/&gt;&lt;ref name=WWS-D-03/&gt; In [[economics]], it is a voluntary transaction where both parties gain wealth, as in [[the double thank-you of capitalism]].

==Types==
* In colloquial speech, a win–win situation often refers to a situation where one benefits, not necessarily through someone else's loss.
* In the context of [[group-dynamic game]]s, win–win games are also called "[[cooperative game]]s", "new games" or "games without losers".
* Mathematical [[game theory]] also refers to win–win games as [[non-zero-sum game]]s (although they may include situations where both players win or lose, as well).
* The TKI Thomas/Kilmann Conflict Profile provides a model that reveals preferences under stress and pressure. [[Collaboration]] style focuses on win–win outcomes.

===Group dynamics===
Group-dynamics win–win games have been increasingly popular since the end of the Vietnam war and have been successfully applied to all levels of society.

Group-dynamics win–win games emphasize the importance of cooperation, fun, sharing, caring and overall group success in contrast to domination, egoistic behavior and personal gain. All players are treated as equally important and valuable. Win–win games often also carry an ethical message of caring for the environment and a [[holistic]] approach to life and society. Win–win games are a powerful tool to give people [[self-confidence]] and a "we" experience, especially when they have suffered from emotional isolation.

An example would be a game where all players try to carry a huge "earth ball" (a ball several meters in diameter) over their heads while negotiating an obstacle course. This is a typical example of a win–win game for several reasons:
* There are no losers (everyone enjoys the accomplished task).
* All players are involved (no-one is left out or sits out).
* The game is psychologically working on many levels (communication, supporting each other, having fun in a group etc.)

There are also mathematical win–win games, the mathematical term being [[non-zero-sum games]]. Such games are often simply represented by a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of payouts.

[[Image:CVRD6windrow.matureing.jpg|thumb|right|Maturing windrows at an [[in-vessel composting]] facility.]]
In [[agriculture]], '''windrow composting''' is the production of [[compost]] by piling [[organic matter]] or [[biodegradable waste]], such as animal manure and crop residues, in long rows (''[[windrow]]s''). This method is suited to producing large volumes of compost. These rows are generally turned to improve porosity and oxygen content, mix in or remove moisture, and redistribute cooler and hotter portions of the pile. Windrow composting is a commonly used farm scale [[composting]] method. Composting process control parameters include the initial ratios of [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]] rich materials, the amount of bulking agent added to assure air porosity, the pile size, moisture content, and turning frequency.

The temperature of the windrows must be measured and logged constantly to determine the optimum time to turn them for quicker compost production.

==Compost windrow turners==

Compost windrow turners were developed to produce [[compost]] on a large scale by Fletcher Sims Jr. of Canyon, Texas {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}. They are traditionally a large machine that straddles a windrow of 4&amp;nbsp;feet (1.25&amp;nbsp;meters) or more high, by as much as 12&amp;nbsp;feet (3.5&amp;nbsp;meters) across. Although smaller machines exist for small windrows, most operations use large machines for volume production. Turners drive through the windrow at a slow rate of forward movement. They have a steel drum with paddles that are rapidly turning. As the turner moves through the windrow, fresh air ([[oxygen]]) is injected into the compost by the drum/paddle assembly, and waste gases produced by bacterial [[decomposition]] are vented. The oxygen feeds the aerobic bacteria and thus speeds the composting process.

;Utilization
To properly use a compost windrow turner, it is ideal to compost on a hard surfaced pad. Heavy-duty compost windrow turners allow the user to obtain optimum results with the aerobic hot composting process. By using [[four wheel drive]] or [[Caterpillar track|tracks]] the windrow turner is capable of turning compost in windrows located in remote locations. With a [[self-trailering]] option this allows the compost windrow turner to convert itself into a trailer to be pulled by a semi-truck [[tractor]]. These two options combined allow the compost windrow turner to be easily hauled anywhere and to work compost windrows in muddy and wet locations.

==Specific applications==
Molasses-based distilleries all over the world generate large amount of effluent termed as spent wash or [[vinasse]]. For each liter of alcohol produced, around 8&amp;nbsp;liters of effluent is generated. This effluent has [[Chemical_oxygen_demand|COD]] of 1,50,000 PPM and [[Biochemical_oxygen_demand|BOD]] of 60,000 PPM and even more. This effluent needs to be treated and the only effective method for conclusive disposal is by composting.

Sugar factories generate pressmud / cachaza during the process and the same has about 30% fibers as carbon and has large amounts of water. This pressmud is dumped on prepared land in the form of 100&amp;nbsp;meters long windrows of 3&amp;nbsp;meters x 1.5&amp;nbsp;meters and spent wash is sprayed on the windrow while the windrow is being turned. These machines help consume spent wash of about 2.5 times of the volume of the pressmud, which means that a 100&amp;nbsp;meters of windrow accommodates about 166 MT of pressmud and uses about 415&amp;nbsp;m³ of Spent wash in 50&amp;nbsp;days.

Microbial Culture (organic solution) TRIO COM-CULT is used about 1&amp;nbsp;kg per MT of pressmud for fast de-composing of the spent wash. Hundreds of thousands of square meters of spent wash is being composted all over the world in countries like India, Colombia, Brazil, Thailand, Indonesia, South Africa etc.

The compost yard has to be prepared in such a way that the land is impervious and does not allow the liquid effluent to pass down into the earth. The compost thus generated is of excellent quality and is rich in nutrients.

[[File:BrokenHillWomensMemorial.JPG|right|thumb|250px|''The [[Broken Hill Women's Memorial]], dedicated to "the women of Broken Hill who have stood by their men during troubled industrial times".'']]
The '''Women's Brigade''' was a labour protest organisation for women formed during the first of several strikes to occur in the mining town of [[Broken Hill]], NSW, Australia between 1889-1920.&lt;ref name="bhs"&gt;http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE4102b.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Precedents===
As early as 1874, Australian women were engaging in direct action in mining disputes in Australia. During the 1874 strikes at the Wallaroo and Moonta mines in South Australia, women entered the mines armed with brooms, forced the men out and closed down the engines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?c=7344&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SCENE AT THE WALLAROO STRIKE. (20 April 1874). ''[[Empire (newspaper)|Empire]]'' (Sydney, NSW : 1850-1875), p. 3. Retrieved 16 April 2011, from http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60986910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;THE WOMEN AT MOONTA. (28 April 1874). ''[[Launceston Examiner]]'' (Tas. : 1842-1899), p. 3. Retrieved 16 April 2011, from http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article52892684&lt;/ref&gt;

===The First Meeting===
The notice for the first meeting read:&lt;ref name="rhb"&gt;Kearns, R.H.B, 1982.Broken Hill, A Pictorial History, Broken Hill Historical Society, Broken Hill, NSW, p154.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A number of Broken Hill Women are very anxious to do something towards supporting the men now out on strike and a meeting for women only will be held at the Masonic Hotel tonight, at 7:30. The president will be the chair. Mr T.C. Tait, the proprietor of the Masonic Hotel, has kindly given the use of his new hall, erected at the site of the hotel, for the use of the women's brigade. All matrons and maids who are in sympathy with the union are requested to attend.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conditions==
According to Unbroken Spirit, 'Poor living conditions and negligent managerial policy on the mines at Broken Hill fed into a strong union presence from the very early days'.&lt;ref name="Unbroken Spirit: Women in Broken Hill - Unions &amp; Politics" &gt;Unions and Politics, Unbroken Spirit, Australian Women's Archives Project, 2009, http://www.womenaustralia.info/exhib/bh/unionspol.html&lt;/ref&gt; Women and children found life in the mining town harsh, yet fought alongside the miners in favour of the union goals despite the hardship prolonged strikes caused to family welfare.&lt;ref name="bhs" /&gt;

According to Carroll (1986),&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, B. 1986 Built on Silver: a history of Broken Hill South, Hill of Content Publishing Company, Melbourne. {{ISBN|0-85572-1588}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Blainey (1968)&lt;ref&gt;Blainey, G. 1968. The Rise of Broken Hill, Macmillan of Australia, Victoria, p61.&lt;/ref&gt; there was particular concern in the town regarding [[lead poisoning]] from the mine dust. Due to a long delay in developing the technical process for extracting value from the low-lying ores that were mined at Broken Hill,&lt;ref&gt;Jay, Christopher. 1999, A Future More Prosperous: The History of Newcastle Steelworks 1912-1999, The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, Newcastle, p34.&lt;/ref&gt; 40&amp;nbsp;ft high hills of toxic tailings were created about the mines and left without processing until the opening of the [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] [[BHP Steelworks]] in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Jay, Christopher. 1999, A Future More Prosperous: The History of Newcastle Steelworks 1912-1999, The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, Newcastle, pp42-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==

===1889===

Broken Hill's first mining strike occurred in 1889 as a result of the trade union ultimatum that members not be made to work with non-unionised workers. The strike lasted a week and during this time the Women's Brigade was formed.&lt;ref&gt;Kearns, R.H.B, 1982. Broken Hill, A Pictorial History, Broken Hill Historical Society, Broken Hill, NSW.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the arrival of BHP directors from Melbourne on 13 November, the Women's Brigade had set up as 'sentinels'&lt;ref name="advertiser" /&gt; in order to catch any non-union labour, including shift bosses who were 'tarred and whitewashed' the following day while the 2500 miners met to negotiate the dispute with the directors.&lt;ref name="advertiser"&gt;THE BROKEN HILL STRIKE. (14 November 1889). The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA : 1889-1931), p. 5. Retrieved 15 April 2011, from http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article24488285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="courier"&gt;Broken Hill Strike. (14 November 1889). ''The Brisbane Courier'' (Qld. : 1864-1933), p. 5. Retrieved 15 April 2011, from http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3503893&lt;/ref&gt;

A small number of men were injured by the Women's Brigade on 14 November. As a result of this [[Richard Sleath]] on behalf of the union distanced himself from their actions while mentioning the resolve of the women who had a week's worth of provisions and that they intended to remain on picket for the week. An appeal was made for the miners to use their influence with the women to calm their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;THE BROKEN HILL STRIKE. (14 November 1889). South Australian Register (Adelaide, SA : 1839-1900), p. 5. Retrieved 16 April 2011, from http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47285099&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The brigade now numbers 400 members, many of whom took part in the famous sweeping affair at the [[Moonta]] and [[Wallaroo]] mines 15 years ago. Two hundred women spent the night in the mines and two of them have been locked up for trespassing.&lt;ref name="advertiser" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===1892===

The Women's Brigade was very active in using direct action methods against the imported contract labour during the [[1892 Broken Hill miners' strike]].&lt;ref name="Unbroken Spirit: Women in Broken Hill - Unions &amp; Politics" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, R.J. 1988. The Richest Lode:Broken Hill 1883-1988, Hale &amp; Iremonger Pty Limited, Sydney, p241.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bloodworth (1996), there were daily mass rallies and the Barrier United Females' Strike Protest Committee was formed in the initial weeks. The 500-strong Brigade passed a resolution to join the 24 August union demonstration but this was later abandoned in favour of a women's rally on the 25th.&lt;ref name="bloodworth"&gt;Bloodworth, S. (1996) The Rebel Women of Broken Hill in ''Militant Spirits'', La Trobe University, Melbourne. retrieved at http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/interventions/rebelwomen/militant.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent suffragette, [[Mary Lee (suffragette)|Mary Lee]] publicly supported the women of Broken Hill claiming 'that the women of Broken Hill are the first great body of working women who have raised their voices in united protest against the glaring injustice that ''the present constitution will not allow them a voice in framing the laws''...' and that this rendered the [[1892 Broken Hill miners' strike]] 'more profoundly interesting' than any before.&lt;ref name="bloodworth" /&gt;

===1919-1920===

&lt;blockquote&gt;The womenfolk that evening at least got some of their own back, for wherever a 'cop' was observed during the march, he either received a 'back-hander' from a woman on passing or was spat upon. This happened not once, but hundreds of times during that memorable tramp through the city's streets. And, under the circumstances, show to me the workingman that did not, and does not, applaud such acts, and I will show you a creature who lives but to creep and to cringe, and knows but little of the history of his class, or the damnable actions of its historic enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Dale, G in Kearns, R.H.B, 1982. Broken Hill, A Pictorial History, Broken Hill Historical Society, Broken Hill, NSW, p160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
