[[File:Delta-O-18 in deep sea sediment-svg.svg|thumb|300px|[[δ18O|{{delta|18|O|}}]], a proxy for temperature, for the last 600,000 years (an average from several deep sea sediment carbonate samples)]]

The '''100,000-year problem''' ("100&amp;nbsp;ky problem", "100&amp;nbsp;ka problem") of the [[Milankovitch cycles|Milankovitch theory]] of [[orbital forcing]] refers to a discrepancy between the reconstructed [[geologic temperature record]] and the reconstructed amount of incoming solar radiation, or [[insolation]] over the past 800,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raymo|first=Maureen E.|author-link=Maureen Raymo|last2=Nisancioglu|first2=Kerim H.|date=|year=2003|title=The 41 kyr world: Milankovitch’s other unsolved mystery|url=|journal=Paleoceanography|volume=18|issue=1|pages=|bibcode=2003PalOc..18.1011R|doi=10.1029/2002PA000791|quote=All serious students of Earth's climate history have heard of the '100 kyr problem' of Milankovitch orbital theory, namely the lack of an obvious explanation of the dominant ~100 kyr periodicity in climate records of the last 800,000 years.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to variations in the Earth's orbit, the amount of insolation varies with periods of around 21,000, 40,000, 100,000, and 400,000 years. Variations in the amount of incident solar energy drive changes in the [[climate]] of the Earth, and are recognised as a key factor in the timing of initiation and termination of [[glaciation]]s.

While there is a Milankovitch cycle in the range of 100,000 years, related to Earth's [[orbital eccentricity]], its contribution to variation in insolation is much smaller than those of [[precession]] and [[obliquity]]. The 100,000-year-problem refers to the lack of an obvious explanation for the periodicity of [[ice age]]s at roughly 100,000 years for the past million years, but not before, when the dominant periodicity corresponded to 41,000 years.
The unexplained transition between the two periodicity regimes is known as the [[Middle Pleistocene|mid-Pleistocene]] transition, dated to some 800,000 years ago.

The related "400,000-year-problem" refers to the absence of a 400,000-year periodicity due to [[orbital eccentricity]] in the geological temperature record over the past 1.2&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref&gt;Richard John Huggett, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=_DF-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT95  "Problems with orbital forcing"], ''The Natural History of Earth: Debating Long-Term Change in the Geosphere and Biosphere'', Routledge Studies in Physical Geography and Environment, 2006.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition of the 100,000-year cycle==
[[Image:Epica-vostok-grip-140kyr.png|thumb|300px|A &amp;delta;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/suP&gt;O record for the past 140,000&amp;nbsp;years from Greenland ([[NGRIP]]) and Antarctica ([[EPICA]], [[Vostok Station#Ice core drilling|Vostok]]) ice cores]]

The [[geologic temperature record]] can be [[palaeoclimatology|reconstructed]] from sedimentary evidence. Perhaps the most useful indicator of past climate is the [[isotope fractionation|fractionation]] of [[oxygen isotope]]s, denoted [[&amp;delta;18O|''&amp;delta;''&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]]. This fractionation is controlled mainly by the amount of water locked up in ice and the absolute temperature of the planet, and has allowed a timescale of [[marine isotope stage]]s to be constructed.

By the late 1990s, {{delta|18|O}} records of air (in the [[Vostok Station#Ice core drilling|Vostok]] ice core) and marine [[foramanifera|sediments]] was available and was compared with estimates of [[insolation]], which should affect both temperature and ice volume. As described by [[Nicholas Shackleton|Shackleton]] (2000), the deep-sea sediment record of {{delta|18|O}} "is dominated by a 100,000-year cyclicity that is universally interpreted as the main ice-age rhythm". Shackleton (2000) adjusted the time scale of the Vostok ice core {{delta|18|O}} record to fit the assumed [[orbital forcing]] and used spectral analysis to identify and subtract the component of the record that in this interpretation could be attributed to a linear (directly proportional) response to the orbital forcing. The residual signal (the remainder), when compared with the residual from a similarly retuned marine core isotope record, was used to estimate the proportion of the signal that was attributable to ice volume, with the rest (having attempted to allow for the [[Dole effect]]) being attributed to temperature changes in the deep water.

The 100,000-year component of ice volume variation was found to match sea level records based on coral age determinations, and to lag orbital eccentricity by several thousand years, as would be expected if orbital eccentricity were the pacing mechanism. Strong non-linear "jumps" in the record appear at [[deglaciation]]s, although the 100,000-year periodicity was not the strongest periodicity in this "pure" ice volume record.

The separate deep sea temperature record was found to vary directly in phase with orbital eccentricity, as did Antarctic temperature and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; so eccentricity appears to exert a geologically immediate effect on air temperatures, deep sea temperatures, and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Shackleton (2000) concluded: "The effect of orbital eccentricity probably enters the paleoclimatic record through an influence on the concentration of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;".&lt;ref name="Shackleton2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shackleton, N.J.|first=|authorlink=Nicholas Shackleton|date=|year=2000|title=The 100,000-Year Ice-Age Cycle Identified and Found to Lag Temperature, Carbon Dioxide, and Orbital Eccentricity|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/289/5486/1897?ck=nck|journal=Science|volume=289|issue=5486|pages=1897–1902|bibcode=2000Sci...289.1897S|doi=10.1126/science.289.5486.1897|pmid=10988063|accessdate=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elkibbi and Rial (2001) identified the 100&amp;nbsp;ka cycle as one of five main challenges met by the [[Milankovitch cycles|Milankovitch]] model of [[orbital forcing]] of the ice ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elkibbi Maya, Rial Jose A |year=2001 |title=An outsider's review of the astronomical theory of the climate: is the eccentricity-driven insolation the main driver of the ice ages? |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=56 |pages=161–177 |doi=10.1016/s0012-8252(01)00061-7|bibcode=2001ESRv...56..161E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypotheses to explain the problem==
[[Image:Earth obliquity range.jpg|alt=Diagram shows that obliquity varies from 22.1 to 24.5 degrees.|thumb||The effect of obliquity variations may, in concert with precession, be amplified by orbital inclination.]]

As the 100,000-year periodicity only dominates the climate of the past million years, there is insufficient information to separate the component frequencies of eccentricity using spectral analysis, making the reliable detection of significant longer-term trends more difficult, although the spectral analysis of much longer palaeoclimate records, such as the Lisiecki and Raymo stack of marine cores&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lorraine-lisiecki.com/stack.html |title=LR04 Benthic Stack |last=Lisiecki |first=Lorraine |authorlink=Lorraine Lisiecki |year=2005 |publisher=lorraine-lisiecki.com |accessdate=Oct 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and James Zachos' composite isotopic record, helps to put the last million years in longer term context. Hence there is still no clear proof of the mechanism responsible for the 100&amp;nbsp;ka periodicity—but there are several credible hypotheses.

===Climatic resonance===
The mechanism may be internal to the Earth system. The Earth's climate system may have a natural [[resonance|resonance frequency]] of 100&amp;nbsp;ka; that is to say, feedback processes within the climate automatically produce a 100&amp;nbsp;ka effect, much as a bell naturally rings at a certain pitch.&lt;ref name="Ghil1994"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ghil|first=Michael|date=|year=1994|title=Cryothermodynamics: the chaotic dynamics of paleoclimate|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=193534|journal=Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena|volume=77|issue=1–3|pages=130–159|bibcode=1994PhyD...77..130G|doi=10.1016/0167-2789(94)90131-7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gildor2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gildor|first=Hezi|last2=Tziperman|first2=Eli|date=|year=2000|title=Sea ice as the glacial cycles' climate switch: Role of seasonal and orbital forcing|url=|journal=Paleoceanography|volume=15|issue=6|pages=605–615|bibcode=2000PalOc..15..605G|doi=10.1029/1999PA000461|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents to this claim point out that the resonance would have to have developed 1 million years ago, as a 100&amp;nbsp;ka periodicity was weak to non-existent for the preceding 2&amp;nbsp;million years. This is feasible—[[continental drift]] and [[sea floor spreading]] rate change have been postulated as possible causes of such a change.&lt;ref name=Ruddiman2006 /&gt; Free oscillations of components of the Earth system have been considered as a cause,&lt;ref name="Saltzman1984"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Saltzman|first=Barry|last2=Hansen|first2=Anthony R.|last3=Maasch|first3=Kirk A.|date=|title=The late Quaternary glaciations as the response of a three-component feedback system to Earth-orbital forcing|url=|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|publication-date=December 1984|volume=41|issue=23|pages=3380–3389|bibcode=1984JAtS...41.3380S|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1984)041&lt;3380:TLQGAT&gt;2.0.CO;2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but too few Earth systems have a thermal inertia on a thousand-year timescale for any long-term changes to accumulate. The most common hypothesis looks to the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, which might expand through a few shorter cycles until large enough to undergo a sudden collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Denton |first1=G. H. |last2=Anderson |first2=R. F.|display-authors=etal |title=The Last Glacial Termination |journal=Science |year=2010 |volume=328 |issue=5986 |pages=1652–1656 |doi=10.1126/science.1184119|bibcode=2010Sci...328.1652D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 100,000-year problem has been scrutinized by José A. Rial, Jeseung Oh and Elizabeth Reischmann&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rial|first=José A.|last2=Oh|first2=Jeseung|last3=Reischmann|first3=Elizabeth|date=|title=Synchronization of the climate system to eccentricity forcing and the 100,000-year problem|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n4/full/ngeo1756.html|journal=Nature Geoscience|publication-date=2013-03-10|volume=6|issue=4|pages=289–293|bibcode=2013NatGe...6..289R|doi=10.1038/NGEO1756|accessdate=Oct 16, 2014|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who find that master-slave synchronization between the climate systems natural frequencies and the eccentricity forcing started the 100&amp;nbsp;ky ice ages of the late Pleistocene and explain their large amplitude.

===Orbital inclination===
[[Image:Earth precession.jpg|alt=Drawing shows the preseasonal change in orbital inclination as the earth turns counter-clock wise.|thumb|Precessional cycles may produce a 100,000 year effect.]]

[[Milankovitch cycles#Orbital inclination|Orbital inclination]] has a 100&amp;nbsp;ka periodicity, while [[Milankovitch cycles#Orbital shape|eccentricity]]'s 95 and 125ka periods could inter-react to give a 108ka effect. While it is possible that the less significant, and originally overlooked, inclination variability has a deep effect on climate,&lt;ref name="Muller1995"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Muller|first=Richard A.|last2=MacDonald|first2=Gordon J.|date=|year=1995|title=Glacial cycles and orbital inclination|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/377107b0|journal=Nature|publication-date=1995-09-14|volume=377|issue=6545|pages=107–108|bibcode=1995Natur.377..107M|doi=10.1038/377107b0|accessdate=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the eccentricity only modifies insolation by a small amount: 1–2% of the shift caused by the 21,000-year precession and 41,000-year obliquity cycles.  Such a big impact from inclination would therefore be disproportionate in comparison to other cycles.&lt;ref name="Ruddiman2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ruddiman|first=William F.|date=|title=Orbital changes and climate|url=http://www.geo.vu.nl/users/peef/teaching/orbital_forcing/assets/Ruddiman_2006_QSR.pdf|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|publication-date=December 2006|volume=25|issue=23–24|pages=3092–3112|bibcode=2006QSRv...25.3092R|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2006.09.001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030023122/http://www.geo.vu.nl/users/peef/teaching/orbital_forcing/assets/Ruddiman_2006_QSR.pdf|archive-date=Oct 30, 2008|accessdate=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One possible mechanism suggested to account for this was the passage of Earth through regions of cosmic dust. Our eccentric orbit would take us through dusty clouds in space, which would act to occlude some of the incoming radiation, shadowing the Earth.&lt;ref name=Muller1995 /&gt;

In such a scenario, the abundance of the isotope [[helium-3|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He]], [[cosmogenic|produced]] by [[cosmic ray|solar ray]]s splitting gases in the upper atmosphere, would be expected to decrease—and initial investigations did indeed find such a drop in &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He abundance.&lt;ref name="Farley1995"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Farley|first=K.A.|date=|title=Cenozoic variations in the flux of interplanetary dust recorded by &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He in a deep-sea sediment|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/376153a0|journal=Nature|publication-date=1995-07-13|volume=376|issue=6536|pages=153–156|bibcode=1995Natur.376..153F|doi=10.1038/376153a0|accessdate=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kortenkamp1998"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kortenkamp|first=Stephen J.|last2=Dermott|first2=Stanley F.|date=1998-05-08|title=A 100,000-Year Periodicity in the Accretion Rate of Interplanetary Dust|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/280/5365/874|journal=Science|volume=280|issue=5365|pages=874–6|bibcode=1998Sci...280..874K|doi=10.1126/science.280.5365.874|pmid=9572725|accessdate=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Others have argued possible effects from the dust entering the atmosphere itself, for example by increasing cloud cover (on July 9 and January 9, when the Earth passes through the invariable plane, [[mesospheric cloud]] increases).&lt;ref name="pmid11607741"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Muller|first=Richard A.|last2=MacDonald|first2=Gordon J.|date=|title=Spectrum of 100-kyr glacial cycle: orbital inclination, not eccentricity.|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=11607741|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|publication-date=1997-08-05|volume=94|issue=16|pages=8329–34|bibcode=1997PNAS...94.8329M|doi=10.1073/pnas.94.16.8329|pmc=33747|pmid=11607741|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the 100&amp;nbsp;ka eccentricity cycle can act as a "pacemaker" to the system, amplifying the effect of precession and obliquity cycles at key moments, with its perturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hays|first=J.D.|last2=Imbrie|first2=John|last3=Shackleton|first3=N.J.|date=1976-12-10|title=Variations in the Earth's Orbit: Pacemaker of the Ice Ages|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/194/4270/1121|journal=Science|volume=194|issue=4270|pages=1121–32|bibcode=1976Sci...194.1121H|doi=10.1126/science.194.4270.1121|pmid=17790893|access-date=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precession cycles===
A similar suggestion holds the 21,636-year [[Milankovitch cycles#Apsidal precession|precession cycles]] solely responsible. Ice ages are characterized by the slow buildup of ice volume, followed by relatively swift melting phases. It is possible that ice built up over several precession cycles, only melting after four or five such cycles.&lt;ref name="Imbrie1980"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Imbrie|first=John|last2=Imbrie|first2=John Z.|date=1980-02-29|title=Modeling the Climatic Response to Orbital Variations|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/207/4434/943|journal=Science|volume=207|issue=4434|pages=943–53|bibcode=1980Sci...207..943I|doi=10.1126/science.207.4434.943|pmid=17830447|accessdate=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar luminosity fluctuation===
A mechanism that may account for periodic fluctuations in solar luminosity has also been proposed as an explanation.   Diffusion waves occurring within the sun can be modeled in such a way that they explain the observed climatic shifts on earth.&lt;ref name="Ehrlich2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ehrlich|first=Robert|date=|title=Solar resonant diffusion waves as a driver of terrestrial climate change|url=http://mason.gmu.edu/%7Erehrlich/Diffusion_waves.pdf|journal=[[Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics]]|publication-date=May 2007|volume=69|issue=7|pages=759–766|arxiv=astro-ph/0701117|bibcode=2007JASTP..69..759E|doi=10.1016/j.jastp.2007.01.005|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the He&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; signal again appears to contradict this finding.&lt;ref name="Marsh2007"&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=0706.3621|class=physics.gen-ph|first=Gerald E.|last=Marsh|title=Climate Change: The Sun's Role|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land vs. oceanic photosynthesis===
[[Image:Algal bloom 20040615.jpg|alt=The lighter coloring of irregular patches in the Atlantic Ocean off France shows where algae are blooming.|thumb|An [[algal bloom]]. The relative importance of land- and sea-based photosynthesis may fluctuate on a 100,000-year timescale.]]

The [[Dole effect]] describes trends in {{delta|18|O}} arising from trends in the relative importance of land-dwelling and oceanic [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizers]]. Such a variation is a plausible cause of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Bender1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bender|first=Michael|last2=Sowers|first2=Todd|last3=Labeyrie|first3=Laurent|date=|title=The Dole effect and its variations during the last 130,000 years as measured in the Vostok ice core|url=http://www.whoi.edu/cms/files/bender94gbc_222964.pdf|journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles|publication-date=September 1994|volume=8|issue=3|pages=363–376|bibcode=1994GBioC...8..363B|doi=10.1029/94GB00724|accessdate=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sowers1993"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sowers|first=Todd|last2=Bender|first2=Michael|last3=Labeyrie|first3=Laurent|last4=Martinson|first4=Doug|last5=Jouzel|first5=Jean|last6=Raynaud|first6=Dominique|last7=Pichon|first7=Jean Jacques|last8=Korotkevich|first8=Yevgeniy Sergeevich|date=|year=1993|title=A 135000-year Vostok-SPECMAP common temporal framework|url=|journal=Paleoceanography|volume=8|issue=6|pages=737–766|bibcode=1993PalOc...8..737S|doi=10.1029/93PA02328|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ongoing research===

The new chronology is inconsistent with the "inclination" theory of the 100,000-year cycle. The establishment of leads and lags against different orbital forcing components with this method—which uses the direct insolation control over nitrogen-oxygen ratios in ice core bubbles—is in principle a great improvement in the temporal resolution of these records and another significant validation of the Milankovitch hypothesis. An international climate modelling exercise (Abe-ouchi ''et al.'', Nature, 2013&lt;ref name="AbeOuchi2013"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Abe-Ouchi|first=Ayako|displayauthors=et al.|date=|year=2013|title=Insolation-driven 100,000-year glacial cycles and hysteresis of ice-sheet volume|url=|journal=Nature|volume=500|issue=7461|pages=190–193|bibcode=2013Natur.500..190A|doi=10.1038/nature12374|pmid=23925242|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) demonstrated that climate models can replicate the 100,000-year cyclicity given the orbital forcing and carbon dioxide levels of the late Pleistocene. The isostatic history of ice sheets was implicated in mediating the 100,000-year response to the orbital forcing. Larger ice sheets are lower in elevation because they depress the continental crust upon which they sit, and are therefore more vulnerable to melting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3886">{{selfref|This is about variables in computer science, for Wikipedia user access levels, see [[Wikipedia:User access levels|User access levels]]}}

In [[computer science]] and [[computer programming]], '''access level''' denotes the set of permissions or restrictions provided to a [[data type]]. Reducing access level is an effective method for limiting [[Failure cause|failure modes]], [[debugging]] time and overall system complexity. It restricts variable modification to only the methods defined within the interface to the class. Thus, it is incorporated into many fundamental [[software design pattern]]s. In general, a given object cannot be created, read, updated or deleted by any function without having a sufficient access level.

The two most common access levels are ''public'' and ''private'', which denote, respectively; permission across the entire program scope, or permission only within the corresponding class. A third, ''protected'', extends permissions to all subclasses of the corresponding class. Access levels modifiers are commonly used in Java &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html|title=Controlling Access to Members of a Class (The Java™ Tutorials &gt;                     Learning the Java Language &gt; Classes and Objects)|website=docs.oracle.com|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as C#, which further provides the ''internal'' level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wxh6fsc7.aspx|title=Access Modifiers (C# Reference)|website=msdn.microsoft.com|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In C++, the only difference between a [[Struct (C programming language)|struct]] and a [[Class (computer science)|class]] is the default access level, which is ''private'' for classes and ''public'' for structs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/inheritance/|title=Friendship and inheritance - C++ Tutorials|website=www.cplusplus.com|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To illustrate the benefit: consider a public variable which can be accessed from any part of a program. If an error occurs, the culprit could be within any portion of the program, including various sub-dependencies. In a large code base, this leads to thousands of potential sources. Alternatively, consider a private variable. Due to access restrictions, all modifications to its value must occur via functions defined within the class. Therefore, the error is structurally contained within the class. There is often only a single source file for each class, which means debugging only requires evaluation of a single file. With sufficient [[Modularity (programming)|modularity]] and minimal access level, large code bases can avoid many challenges associated with complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/143736/why-do-we-need-private-variables|title=Why do we need private variables?|website=softwareengineering.stackexchange.com|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example: Bank Balance Class ==
Retrieved from Java Coffee Break Q&amp;A &lt;ref&gt;http://www.javacoffeebreak.com/faq/faq0002.html&lt;/ref&gt;
 public class bank_balance
 {
 	public String owner;
 	private int balance; 
 
 	public bank_balance( String name, int dollars )
 	{
 		owner = name;
 
 		if (dollars &gt;= 0)
 			balance = dollars;
 		else
 			dollars =0;
 	}
 
 	public int getBalance()
 	{
 		return balance;
 	}
 
 	public void setBalance(int dollars)
 	{
 		if (dollars &gt;= 0)
 			balance = dollars;
 		else
 			dollars = 0;		
 	}
 }
Here, the imperative variable ''balance'' is defined as a ''private int''. This ensures other classes, methods and functions cannot accidentally overwrite the variable balance. Instead, they must access the interface for the class ''bank_balance'', whose methods ensure the balance cannot drop below 0.

[[File:Carbonate system of seawater.svg|thumb|Example Bjerrum plot: Change in carbonate system of seawater from [[ocean acidification]].]]

A '''Bjerrum plot''' (named after [[Niels Bjerrum]]) is a [[chart|graph]] of the [[concentration]]s of the different species of a [[Acid#Polyprotic acids|polyprotic acid]] in a [[solution]], as functions of the solution's [[pH]],&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Andersen|first=C. B.|coauthors= |year=2002 |title=Understanding carbonate equilibria by measuring alkalinity in experimental and natural systems |url= |archiveurl= |archivedate=  | journal=Journal of Geoscience Education |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=389–403 |doi=10.5408/1089-9995-50.4.389 |pmid= |bibcode=2002JGeEd..50..389A}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the solution is at [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]]. Due to the many [[orders of magnitude]] spanned by the concentrations, they are commonly plotted on a [[logarithmic scale]]. Sometimes the ratios of the concentrations are plotted rather than the actual concentrations. Occasionally H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; are also plotted.

Most often, the carbonate system is plotted, where the polyprotic acid is [[carbonic acid]] (a [[diprotic acid]]), and the different species are [[carbonic acid]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[bicarbonate]], and [[carbonate]]. In acidic conditions, the dominant form is {{CO2}}; in [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] (alkalinic) conditions, the dominant form is CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;; and in between, the dominant form is HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. At every pH, the concentration of carbonic acid is assumed to be negligible compared to the concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and so is often omitted from Bjerrum plots. These plots are typically used in ocean chemistry to track the response of an ocean to changes in both pH and of inputs in carbonate and {{chem|CO|2}}.&lt;ref name="wolfgladrow2007"&gt;{{cite journal | author=D.A. Wolf-Gladrow| title=Total alkalinity: the explicit conservative expression and its application to biogeochemical processes| journal=Marine Chemistry| year=2007| volume=106| issue=1| url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/faculty/zeebe_files/Publications/WolfGladrowMarChem07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bjerrum plots for other polyprotic acids, including [[Silicic acid|silicic]], [[Boric acid|boric]], [[Sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[Phosphoric acid|phosphoric]] acids, can also be constructed.&lt;ref name=Andersen /&gt;

[[File:Carbonate Bjerrum.gif|thumb|alt=Distribution of DIC (Carbonate) species with pH for 25C and 5,000 ppm salinity (e.g. salt-water swimming pool) - Bjerrum plot]]
If [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbonic acid]], [[hydron (chemistry)|hydrogen ions]], [[bicarbonate]] and [[carbonate]] are all dissolved in [[water]], and at [[chemical equilibrium]], their equilibrium [[concentration]]s are often assumed to be given by:

: &lt;math&gt; [\textrm{CO}_2]_{eq} =  \frac{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}^2}{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}^2 + K_1[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq} + K_1K_2} \times \textrm{DIC},  &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; [\textrm{HCO}_3^-]_{eq} =  \frac{K_1[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}}{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}^2 + K_1[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq} + K_1K_2} \times \textrm{DIC},  &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; [\textrm{CO}_3^{2-}]_{eq} =  \frac{K_1K_2}{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}^2 + K_1[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq} + K_1K_2} \times \textrm{DIC},  &lt;/math&gt;
where the subscript 'eq' denotes that these are equilibrium concentrations, ''K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[equilibrium constant]] for the reaction {{chem|CO|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e. the first [[acid dissociation constant]] for carbonic acid), ''K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[equilibrium constant]] for the reaction HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e. the second [[acid dissociation constant]] for carbonic acid), and DIC is the (unchanging) total [[concentration]] of [[Total inorganic carbon|dissolved inorganic carbon]] in the system, i.e. [{{CO2}}] + [HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;] + [CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;]. ''K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' and DIC each have units of a [[concentration]], e.g. [[Mole (unit)|mol]]/[[litre]].

A Bjerrum plot is obtained by using these three equations to plot these three species against pH = –{{nowrap|log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;}}, for given ''K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' and DIC. The fractions in these equations give the three species' relative proportions, and so if DIC is unknown, or the actual concentrations are unimportant, these proportions may be plotted instead.

These three equations show that the curves for {{CO2}} and HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; intersect at [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; = ''K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the curves for HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; intersect at [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; = ''K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''. Therefore, the values of ''K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' that were used to create a given Bjerrum plot can easily be found from that plot, by reading off the concentrations at these points of intersection. An example with linear Y axis is shown in the accompanying graph. It should be noted that the values of K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and therefore the curves in the Bjerrum plot, vary substantially with temperature and salinity.&lt;ref&gt;Mook W (2000) Chemistry of carbonic acid in water.

==Chemical and mathematical derivation of Bjerrum plot equations for carbonate system==
Suppose that the reactions between [[carbon dioxide]], [[hydron (chemistry)|hydrogen ions]], [[bicarbonate]] and [[carbonate]] [[ions]], all dissolved in [[water]], are as follows:
: {{chem|CO|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} (1)
: {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} (2)

(Note that reaction (1) is actually the combination of two [[elementary reaction]]s: {{chem|CO|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} {{eqm}} {{chem|H|2|CO|3}} {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.)

Assuming the [[mass action law]] applies to these two reactions, that water is [[Abundance (chemistry)|abundant]], and that the different chemical species are always well-mixed, their [[rate equation]]s are
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\textrm{d}[\textrm{CO}_2]}{\textrm{d}t}= -k_1[\textrm{CO}_2] + k_{-1}[\textrm{H}^+][\textrm{HCO}_3^-], &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\textrm{d}[\textrm{H}^+]}{\textrm{d}t}= k_1[\textrm{CO}_2] - k_{-1}[\textrm{H}^+][\textrm{HCO}_3^-] + k_2[\textrm{HCO}_3^-] - k_{-2}[\textrm{H}^+][\textrm{CO}_3^{2-}], &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\textrm{d}[\textrm{HCO}_3^-]}{\textrm{d}t}= k_1[\textrm{CO}_2] - k_{-1}[\textrm{H}^+][\textrm{HCO}_3^-] - k_2[\textrm{HCO}_3^-] + k_{-2}[\textrm{H}^+][\textrm{CO}_3^{2-}], &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\textrm{d}[\textrm{CO}_3^{2-}]}{\textrm{d}t}= k_2[\textrm{HCO}_3^-] - k_{-2}[\textrm{H}^+][\textrm{CO}_3^{2-}], &lt;/math&gt;
where [{{space}}] denotes [[concentration]], ''t'' is time, and ''k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''k&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;'' are appropriate [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] constants for reaction (1), called respectively the forwards and reverse [[Reaction rate constant|rate constants]] for this reaction. (Similarly ''k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''k&lt;sub&gt;−2&lt;/sub&gt;'' for reaction (2).)

{{space}}

'''At any equilibrium''', the concentrations are unchanging, hence the left hand sides of these equations are zero. Then, from the first of these four equations, the ratio of reaction (1)'s rate constants equals the ratio of its equilibrium concentrations, and this ratio, called ''K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', is called the [[equilibrium constant]] for reaction (1), i.e.
: &lt;math&gt; K_1 = \frac{k_1}{k_{-1}} = \frac{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}[\textrm{HCO}_3^-]_{eq}}{[\textrm{CO}_2]_{eq}}, &lt;/math&gt; {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} (3) {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}}
where the subscript 'eq' denotes that these are equilibrium concentrations.

Similarly, from the fourth equation for the [[equilibrium constant]] ''K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' for reaction (2),
: &lt;math&gt; K_2 = \frac{k_2}{k_{-2}} = \frac{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}[\textrm{CO}_3^{2-}]_{eq}}{[\textrm{HCO}_3^-]_{eq}}. &lt;/math&gt; {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} (4)

Rearranging (3) gives
: &lt;math&gt; [\textrm{HCO}_3^-]_{eq} =  \frac{K_1[\textrm{CO}_2]_{eq}}{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}}, &lt;/math&gt; {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} (5)
and rearranging (4), then substituting in (5), gives
: &lt;math&gt; [\textrm{CO}_3^{2-}]_{eq} =  \frac{K_2[\textrm{HCO}_3^-]_{eq}}{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}}
=  \frac{K_1K_2[\textrm{CO}_2]_{eq}}{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}^2}. &lt;/math&gt; {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} (6)

{{space}}

The total [[concentration]] of [[Total inorganic carbon|dissolved inorganic carbon]] in the system is given by
: &lt;math&gt; \textrm{DIC} =  [\textrm{CO}_2] + [\textrm{HCO}_3^-] + [\textrm{CO}_3^{2-}] &lt;/math&gt;
: {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}}  &lt;math&gt;  =  [\textrm{CO}_2]_{eq} \left(1 + \frac{K_1}{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}} + \frac{K_1K_2}{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}^2}\right) &lt;/math&gt; {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}}  substituting in (5) and (6)
: {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} &lt;math&gt;  =
[\textrm{CO}_2]_{eq} \left(\frac{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}^2 + K_1[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}+K_1K_2}{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}^2}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

{{space}}

Re-arranging this gives the equation for {{chem|CO|2}}:
: &lt;math&gt; [\textrm{CO}_2]_{eq} =  \frac{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}^2}{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}^2 + K_1[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq} + K_1K_2} \times \textrm{DIC}.  &lt;/math&gt;

{{space}}

The equations for HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; are obtained by substituting this into (5) and (6).

{{Descartes}}
'''Cartesian doubt''' is a form of '''methodological skepticism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; associated with the writings and methodology of [[René Descartes]] (1596{{ndash}}1650).&lt;ref name="Philosophical Glossary"&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20010621215141/http://www.swif.uniba.it/lei/foldop/foldoc.cgi?Cartesian+doubt A Philosophical Glossary]" edited by Justin Leiber, Philosophy Department, University of Houston, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scruton"/&gt; Cartesian doubt is also known as '''Cartesian skepticism''', '''methodic doubt''', '''methodological skepticism''', '''universal doubt''', '''systematic doubt''' or '''hyperbolic doubt'''.

Cartesian doubt is a systematic process of being skeptical about (or doubting) the truth of one's beliefs, which has become a characteristic method in [[philosophy]]. This method of doubt was largely popularized in Western philosophy by René Descartes, who sought to doubt the truth of all his beliefs in order to determine which beliefs he could be certain were true. It is the basis for Descartes' statement, "''[[Cogito ergo sum]]''" ("I think, therefore I am").

Methodological skepticism is distinguished from [[philosophical skepticism]] in that methodological skepticism is an approach that subjects all knowledge claims to scrutiny with the goal of sorting out true from false claims, whereas philosophical skepticism is an approach that questions the possibility of certain knowledge.

== Characteristics ==
Cartesian doubt is methodological. Its purpose is to use doubt as a route to certain knowledge by finding those things which could not be doubted. The fallibility of sense data in particular is a subject of Cartesian doubt.

There are several interpretations as to the objective of Descartes' skepticism. Prominent among these is a [[W:foundationalism|foundationalist]] account which claims that Descartes' skepticism is aimed at eliminating all belief which it is possible to doubt, thus leaving Descartes with only [[basic belief]]s (also known as foundational beliefs). From these indubitable basic beliefs, Descartes then attempts to derive further knowledge. It's an archetypal and significant example that epitomizes the [[Rationalism|Continental Rational]] schools of philosophy.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

== Technique ==
Descartes' method of hyperbolic doubt included:
# accepting only information you know to be true
# breaking down these truths into smaller units
# solving the simple problems first
# making ''complete'' lists of further ''problems''

Hyperbolic doubt means having the tendency to doubt, since it is an extreme or exaggerated form of doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Skirry (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; (Knowledge in the Cartesian sense means to know something beyond not merely all reasonable, but all possible, doubt.) In his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' (1641), Descartes resolved to systematically doubt that any of his beliefs were true, in order to build, from the ground up, a belief system consisting of only certainly true beliefs; his end goal—or a major one, at the least—was to find an undoubtable basis for the sciences. Consider Descartes' opening lines of the ''Meditations'':

{{Quotation | Several years have now elapsed since I first became aware that I had accepted, even from my youth, many false opinions for true, and that consequently what I afterward based on such principles was highly doubtful; and from that time I was convinced of the necessity of undertaking once in my life to rid myself of all the opinions I had adopted, and of commencing anew the work of building from the foundation... | René Descartes | Meditation I'', 1641}}

== Descartes's method ==
René Descartes, the originator of Cartesian doubt, put all beliefs, ideas, thoughts, and matter in doubt. He showed that his grounds, or reasoning, for any knowledge could just as well be false. Sensory experience, the primary mode of knowledge, is often erroneous and therefore must be doubted. For instance, what one is seeing may very well be a [[hallucination]]. There is nothing that proves it cannot be. In short, if there is any way a belief can be disproved, then its grounds are insufficient. From this, Descartes proposed two arguments, the dream and the demon.&lt;ref name="Scruton"&gt;[[Roger Scruton]]. ''Modern Philosophy: An Introduction and Survey''. London: Penguin Books, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The dream argument ===
{{See also|Dream argument}}

Descartes, knowing that the context of our dreams, while possibly unbelievable, are often lifelike, hypothesized that humans can only believe that they are awake. There are no sufficient grounds by which to distinguish a dream experience from a waking experience. For instance, Subject A sits at the computer, typing this article. Just as much evidence exists to indicate that the act of composing this article is reality as there is evidence to demonstrate the opposite. Descartes conceded that we live in a world that can create such ideas as dreams. However, by the end of ''The Meditations'', he concludes that we can distinguish dream from reality at least in retrospect:&lt;ref name="Scruton"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"But when I distinctly see where things come from and where and when they come to me, and when I can connect my perceptions of them with my whole life without a break then I can be certain that when I encounter these things  I am not asleep but awake." &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;— Descartes: Selected Philosophical Writings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tNxSphqAYkC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=%22But+when+I+distinctly+see+where+things+come+from+and%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5_iRLDxEc-&amp;sig=4qw-RoWL9GPSHQvlI4cgzBEC1pw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjIkbHR9o_dAhUBUK0KHf07DMcQ6AEwAnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22But%20when%20I%20distinctly%20see%20where%20things%20come%20from%20and%22&amp;f=false|title=Descartes: Selected Philosophical Writings|last=Descartes|first=René|date=1988-02-26|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521358125|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The Evil Demon ===

{{Main|Evil demon}}

Descartes reasoned that our very own experience may very well be controlled by an ''evil demon'' of sorts. This demon is as clever and deceitful as he is powerful. He could have created a superficial world that we may think we live in.&lt;ref name="Scruton"/&gt; As a result of this doubt, sometimes termed the Malicious Demon Hypothesis, Descartes found that he was unable to trust even the simplest of his perceptions.

In ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy#Meditation I: Concerning Those Things That Can Be Called into Doubt|Meditation I]]'', Descartes stated that if one were mad, even briefly, the insanity might have driven  man into believing that what we thought was true could be merely our minds deceiving us. He also stated that there could be '[[evil demon|some malicious, powerful, cunning demon]]' that had deceived us, preventing us from judging correctly.

Descartes argued that all his senses were lying and since your senses can easily fool you, his idea of an infinitely powerful being must be true as that idea could have only been put there by an infinitely powerful being which would have no reason to be deceitful to him.

== I think, therefore I am ==

While methodic doubt has a nature, one need not hold that knowledge is impossible in order to apply the method of doubt.  Indeed, Descartes' attempt to apply the method of doubt to the existence of himself spawned the proof of his famous saying, "''[[Cogito, ergo sum]]''" (I think, therefore I am).  That is, Descartes tried to doubt his own existence, but found that even his doubting showed that he existed, since he could not doubt if he did not exist.&lt;ref name="Scruton"/&gt;

The [[Banque de France]] has announced the opening of the '''Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie''' during a press conference held by Governor [[Christian Noyer]], on May 25, 2011. Its opening is programmed for the end of 2014.

This educational place aims at explaining the economy and its concepts to the general public; it will be hosted in the [[Hotel Gaillard]], located at 1, Place du General Catroux, in the 17th district in [[Paris]].

==The project==

[[File:Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.jpg|thumb|alt=Grand lobby of the future Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie|Grand Lobby of the future Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie, architectural and museographic contest, 2011.]]

This place will invite the general public to discover economics, to tackle issues often met in everyday life, or to allow a better understanding of worldwide events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citedeleconomie.fr/IMG/pdf/Discours_C_Noyer_conf_presse_2505.pdf Banque de France Governor Christian Noyer's speech]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Press conference, May 25th, 2011 : Launching of the Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie project&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie will inter alia address teachers and their students, to help illustrate concepts studied at school (indeed half of the 100 000 annual visitors expected should be of school age).&lt;ref&gt;Banque de France press release [http://www.banque-france.fr/fr/instit/communiques/2011/cite-economie-monnaie.htm "''Un grand projet pour un lieu unique : Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie'']", May 25th, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is launched by the [[Banque de France]], which collaborates with several partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banque-france.fr/fr/instit/telechar/communiques/dossier-presse-CEM.pdf Press kit: Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.]&lt;/ref&gt; Among those partners:

* The [[Ministry of National Education (France)]] supports the project and has delegated several teachers to help on the content of the Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.
* The museums of other Central Banks which already exist, like those of the [[European Union]] or the [[Interactive Museum of Economics]] (MIDE), in Mexico.
* Universcience, and especially the [[Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie]] : [[Christian Noyer]], Governor of the [[Banque de France]], and [[Claudie Haigneré]], head of Universcience, have signed a cooperation agreement on the museography of the future Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.
* The ''Institut pour l'Education Financière du Public'', with whom a partnership has been concluded in late 2010.
* The [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]](BnF) : Governor [[Christian Noyer]] and President of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] [[Bruno Racine]] have signed a cooperation agreement on January 3, 2012, regarding the presentation of coin and banknote collections in the future Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.
* The Rencontres des SES : initiative developed by the [[:fr:Académie de Paris|Académie de Paris]], where 11th grade students studying Economics and Social Sciences are invited to meet economists, in order to discuss themes linked to current issues.
* The Little Conferences of the [[:fr:Nouveau Théâtre de Montreuil|Nouveau Théâtre de Montreuil]] : a partnership with the Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie was announced on February 11, 2012, during [[Jean-Claude Trichet]] (former [[Banque de France]] Governor and former President of the [[European Central Bank]])'s conference on the history of money. The partnership is developed around their shared objective of increasing young people's access to knowledge.

==The building==

The Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie will be hosted in the [[Hotel Gaillard]], located at 1, Place du Général Catroux, in the 17th district in [[Paris]].

This neo-gothic mansion has been realized by architect Jules Février at request of Emile Gaillard, banker from the city of [[Grenoble]] and amateur and collector of [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]] art. The [[Hotel Gaillard]] was sold to the [[Banque de France]] in 1919.

From 1919 to 1921, architectural works have been directed by architect Alphonse Defrasse for the [[Banque de France]], especially the building of a steel structure which housed the cashier's desks and other services to the visitors. He also imagined the impressive strong room which could be accessed by a lift bridge, over two-meters-deep moats.&lt;ref&gt;Historical study on the Hotel Gaillard, led by the ''Groupe de Recherche Art Histoire Architecture et Littérature'' (GRAHAL), on request of the Banque de France.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hôtel Gaillard - Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie - travaux Grand Hall 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Grand Lobby construction|Grand Lobby construction works, conceived by the architect Alphonse Defrasse, 1921]]

Listed as a historic monument in 1999, this branch closed in 2006, as a consequence of the plan to close half of the [[Banque de France]]'s branches on the French territory.

==The architectural contest==

The project of the Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie was the object of an architectural contest. Over 100 teams of architects and museographers have participated in this contest which aimed at transforming this former branch of the Banque de France in an educational Cité, while respecting the architecture of the building which is listed as historic monument.

The team of architects – museographers was selected by the [[Banque de France]] amongst the six final projects chosen by the jury of the contest. The team is made of Ateliers Lion for the architecture, François Confino for the museography, and Eric Pallot as architect in charge of historic monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banque-france.fr/fr/instit/telechar/communiques/dossier-presse-CEM.pdf Press kit: Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corpus linguistics''' is the [[study of language]] as expressed in ''[[Text corpus|corpora]]'' (bodies) of "real world" text. The text-corpus method is a digestive approach that derives a set of abstract rules that govern a [[natural language]] from texts in that language, and explores how that language relates to other languages. Originally derived manually, corpora now are automatically derived from source texts. Corpus linguistics proposes that reliable language analysis is more feasible with corpora collected in the field in its natural context ("realia"), and with minimal experimental-interference.

The field of corpus linguistics features divergent views about the value of corpus annotation. These views range from [[John McHardy Sinclair]], who advocates  minimal annotation so texts speak for themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, J. 'The automatic analysis of corpora', in Svartvik, J. (ed.) ''Directions in Corpus Linguistics (Proceedings of Nobel Symposium 82)''. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Survey of English Usage]] team ([[University College, London]]), who advocate annotation as allowing greater linguistic understanding through rigorous recording.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, S. 'Annotation, Retrieval and Experimentation', in Meurman-Solin, A. &amp; Nurmi, A.A. (ed.) Annotating Variation and Change. Helsinki: Varieng, [University of Helsinki]. 2007. [http://www.helsinki.fi/varieng/journal/volumes/01/wallis e-Published]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Linguistics}}
Some of the earliest efforts at grammatical description were based at least in part on corpora of particular religious or cultural significance.  For example, [[Pratisakhya|Prātiśākhya]] literature described the sound patterns of [[Sanskrit]] as found in the [[Vedas]], and 
[[Pāṇini]]'s grammar of [[classical Sanskrit]] was based at least in part on analysis of that same corpus.  Similarly, the early [[Arabic grammar#History|Arabic grammarians]] paid particular attention to the language of the [[Quran]].  In the Western European tradition, scholars prepared [[Bible concordance|concordances]] to allow detailed study of the language of the Bible and other canonical texts.

A landmark in modern corpus linguistics was the publication by [[Henry Kučera]] and [[W. Nelson Francis]] of ''Computational Analysis of Present-Day American English'' in 1967, a work based on the analysis of the [[Brown Corpus]], a carefully compiled selection of current American English, totalling about a million words drawn from a wide variety of sources. Kučera and Francis subjected it to a variety of computational analyses, from which they compiled a rich and variegated opus, combining elements of linguistics, language teaching, [[psychology]], statistics, and [[sociology]]. A further key publication was [[Randolph Quirk]]'s 'Towards a description of English Usage' (1960)&lt;ref&gt;Quirk, R. 'Towards a description of English Usage', ''Transactions of the Philological Society''. 1960. 40–61.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he introduced [[Survey of English Usage|The Survey of English Usage]].

Shortly thereafter, Boston publisher [[Houghton-Mifflin]] approached Kučera to supply a million-word, three-line citation base for its new ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary]]'', the first [[dictionary]] compiled using corpus linguistics. The AHD took the innovative step of combining prescriptive elements (how language ''should'' be used) with descriptive information (how it actually ''is'' used).

Other publishers followed suit. The British publisher Collins' [[COBUILD]] [[monolingual learner's dictionary]], designed for users learning [[English language learning and teaching|English as a foreign language]], was compiled using the [[Bank of English]]. The [[Survey of English Usage]] Corpus was used in the development of one of the most important Corpus-based Grammars, the ''Comprehensive Grammar of English'' (Quirk ''et al.'' 1985).&lt;ref&gt;Quirk, R., Greenbaum, S., Leech, G. and Svartvik, J. ''A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language'' London: Longman. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brown Corpus]] has also spawned a number of similarly structured corpora: the [[LOB Corpus]] (1960s [[British English]]), Kolhapur ([[Indian English]]), Wellington ([[New Zealand English]]), Australian Corpus of English ([[Australian English]]), the Frown Corpus ([[early 1990s]] [[American English]]), and the FLOB Corpus (1990s British English). Other corpora represent many languages, varieties and modes, and include the [[International Corpus of English]], and the [[British National Corpus]], a 100 million word collection of a range of spoken and written texts, created in the 1990s by a consortium of publishers, universities ([[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]]) and the [[British Library]]. For contemporary American English, work has stalled on the [[American National Corpus]], but the 400+ million word [[Corpus of Contemporary American English]] (1990–present) is now available through a web interface.

The first computerized corpus of transcribed spoken language was constructed in 1971 by the Montreal French Project,&lt;ref&gt;Sankoff, D. &amp; Sankoff, G. Sample survey methods and computer-assisted analysis in the study of grammatical variation. In Darnell R. (ed.) ''Canadian Languages in their Social Context'' Edmonton: Linguistic Research Incorporated. 1973. 7–64.&lt;/ref&gt; containing one million words, which inspired [[Shana Poplack]]'s much larger corpus of spoken French in the Ottawa-Hull area.&lt;ref&gt;Poplack, S. The care and handling of a mega-corpus. In Fasold, R. &amp; Schiffrin D. (eds.) ''Language Change and Variation'', Amsterdam: Benjamins. 1989. 411–451.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides these corpora of living languages, computerized corpora have also been made of collections of texts in ancient languages. An example is the [[Francis Andersen|Andersen]]-Forbes database of the Hebrew Bible, developed since the 1970s, in which every clause is parsed using graphs representing up to seven levels of syntax, and every segment tagged with seven fields of information.&lt;ref&gt;

This is a recent project with multiple layers of annotation including morphological segmentation, [[part-of-speech tagging]], and syntactic analysis using dependency grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Dukes, K., Atwell, E. and Habash, N. 'Supervised Collaboration for Syntactic Annotation of Quranic Arabic'. ''Language Resources and Evaluation Journal''. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides pure linguistic inquiry, researchers had begun to apply corpus linguistics to other academic and professional fields, such as the emerging sub-discipline of [[Law and Corpus Linguistics|law and corpus linguistics]], which seeks to understand legal texts using corpus data and tools.

Corpus linguistics has generated a number of research methods, which attempt to trace a path from data to theory. Wallis and Nelson (2001)&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, S. and Nelson G. ''Knowledge discovery in grammatically analysed corpora''. ''Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery'', '''5''': 307–340. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; first introduced what they called the 3A perspective:  Annotation, Abstraction and Analysis.

* '''Annotation''' consists of the application of a scheme to texts. Annotations may include structural markup, [[Lexical category|part-of-speech]] tagging, parsing, and numerous other representations.
* '''Abstraction''' consists of the translation (mapping) of terms in the scheme to terms in a theoretically motivated model or dataset. Abstraction typically includes linguist-directed search but may include e.g., rule-learning for parsers.
* '''Analysis''' consists of statistically probing, manipulating and generalising from the dataset. Analysis might include statistical evaluations, optimisation of rule-bases or knowledge discovery methods.

Most lexical corpora today are part-of-speech-tagged (POS-tagged). However even corpus linguists who work with 'unannotated plain text' inevitably apply some method to isolate salient terms. In such situations annotation and abstraction are combined in a lexical search.

The advantage of publishing an annotated corpus is that other users can then perform experiments on the corpus (through [[corpus manager]]s). Linguists with other interests and differing perspectives than the originators' can exploit this work. By sharing data, corpus linguists are able to treat the corpus as a locus of linguistic debate, rather than as an exhaustive fount of knowledge.

Recent studies have suggested treatment outcome in adolescents with [[social anxiety disorder]] can also be assessed by analysing language by means of Corpus Linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Lopez, L. J, Bedmar, MB, Perez-Paredes, P, &amp; Tornero, E. (2011). TREATMENT CHANGE IN ADOLESCENTS WITH SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER: INSIGHTS FROM CORPUS LINGUISTICS. Ansiedad y Estres, 17, 149-155.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the inspiration of defensive guise behaviors based on [[Mimicry|mimic]] phenomenon in biology,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.octopusworlds.com/octopus-defenses/|title=Octopus Defenses - Octopus Facts and Information|website=www.octopusworlds.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Cyber Mimic Defense''' (CMD) introduces the mechanism of dynamic multi-dimensional reconfiguration into a dissimilar redundancy structure (DRS) which is widely used in [[Reliability engineering|the field of reliability]]. It addresses certain or uncertain threats in cyberspace by the principle of uncertain defense, and provides the strategic varieties and transformations of DRS elements inside objects in quantity or type, time or space dimension under the condition of unchanged visual functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=网络空间拟态防御研究 - 《中国学术期刊（网络版）》|url=http://www.cnki.net/kcms/doi/10.19363/j.cnki.cn10-1380/tn.2016.04.001.html|doi=10.19363/j.cnki.cn10-1380/tn.2016.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It provides a generally innovative defense theory and method to deal with the “known unknown risk” and “unknown unknown risk” which exist in related application levels of different areas of cyberspace and are based on unknown [[Vulnerability|vulnerabilities]], [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoors]], [[Computer virus|viruses]] or [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojans]] and etc. This method can provide not only endogenous security gains which are independent of traditional security means and achieved via integrated structural technologies for critical infrastructures or key information equipment, but also resilient or restorable service ability with intensive attributes inherited from the architecture.

Further it acquires super nonlinear effects combining mature defense technologies. It's aimed at creating a non-closed, self-controlled and sustainable-developed ecological environment which adapts to [[globalization]] technologies and industrial development models and integrates with win-win cooperation and open sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.dahe.cn/2016/11-17/107795596.html|title=网络空间拟态防御亮相“互联网之光”博览会 年底前或将商用_新闻中心_大河网|last=祝萍|website=news.dahe.cn|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In the current [[cyberspace]], there are "unknown unknown threats", namely uncertain threats. Usually, such threats are originated from human attacks, based on existing unknown design [[Software bug|bugs]] referred as [[Vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] in [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]] of [[information system]]s, or induced from [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor attacks]], based on mounting [[Malware|malicious codes]] of software and hardware in the era of globalization which cannot ensure the credibility of the industry chain. Based on the existing scientific level and cognitive ability of [[Human|human beings]], it's impossible to make a scientific judgment neither from the theory nor from the practice that complex information systems have no vulnerabilities and backdoors. Moreover, it's impossible to completely avoid design bugs or backdoors in the engineering level. So it's a consensus in the field of security that the biggest threat in cyberspace comes from unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors, viruses or Trojans and etc.

The existing defense system is the concept of precise defense based on perceptual cognition, which requires a certain amount of clear and reliable prior knowledge as the support, such as sources, characteristics, processes and behavior of attack, working in the precondition of “known risks” or “known unknown risks”. So it's an acquired defense system with the "bottom line defense", often supported by [[encryption]] or [[authentication]]. It is a common fragility in the system and mechanism of defense against unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors, viruses or Trojans and etc. Especially in the ecological environment of system hardware and software components whose credibility cannot be ensured, main defense means based on it almost have no effective real-time defense capability in the face of uncertain threats except for repairing after damages have been done ( “mending the fold after the sheep have been stolen”) without the security guarantee of steps in encryption and authentication or other defensive functions, which can bypass or make short circuits deliberately.

Additionally, existing information systems have [[Statics|static structures]], similar functions, and certain operating mechanisms. These features can’t provide [[attackers]] with the facilitation such as objective identification, defense behavior detection, attack techniques testing and refining, combat effectiveness evaluation and so on. Meanwhile, most of the information systems inherit the operating mechanisms of single processing space and [[Shared resource|resources sharing]], so that invaders can achieve the desired operation through the operating mechanisms of resources sharing when they enter this space. This is also one of the important basic conditions in many network attack theories, including “[[Side-channel attack|the side channel attack]]” which is used to break through the “physical isolation network” nowadays. As a result, the largest [[black hole]] of [[Computer security|cyber security]] consists of determinacy in the information system architecture and mechanism, fragility in passive defensive system, deficiency in active immune mechanisms and other key issues.

== Basic Concepts ==

=== Foundation of the Axioms ===
 Axiom 1：“There are many algorithms to reach the goal under the condition of given functions and performance.”
These diversified heterogeneous algorithms are equivalent under the condition of given functions and performance. If it can be proven that union or intersection calculation results of feasible methods can still meet requirements of equivalent functions, no matter what scheduling strategies or dynamic combination of these heterogeneous algorithms are done, it will not change the given functions. Accordingly, the mapping relationship between the visual functions and the structure of the object is no longer unique or certain from the perspective of attackers, which can be used to achieve the active defense by the defenders.
 Axiom 2：“Everyone has diverse shortcomings while they rarely make the same mistakes on the same tasks in the same place at the same time.”
This axiom provides a theoretical basis for applications of multi-mode ruling mechanisms of the heterogeneous redundancy architecture in fault tolerance, handling random failures of hardware and software in the field of reliability. This means that cyber problems based on unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors, Trojans, viruses and certain or uncertain threats can be transformed into risk protection problems through heterogeneous and redundant mechanism defense. Unless the attackers have resources and capabilities to achieve the consistent error expression through a cooperative attack dilemma under the condition of non-cooperation in heterogeneous multi-target space, it is difficult for attackers to escape from the multi-mode arbitral mechanism.

=== Implementation Architecture ===
&lt;u&gt;Dynamic Heterogeneous Redundancy Architecture&lt;/u&gt;，DHR

=== Operating Mechanism ===
Through the multi-mode policy ruling and multi-dimensional dynamic reconfiguration mechanism under the condition of “de-cooperation”, difficult and costly engineering problems of the attack surface of complex systems can be turned into reduced problems of the attack surface of soft and hard parts, which is space-independent, function-simple and within mimic bracket. Moreover, it's able to minimize the dominant or recessive correlation among heterogeneous redundant entities, which causes the heterogeneous multi-target dynamic cooperative attack dilemma for attackers under the condition of non-cooperation. This reduces the engineering difficulty to implement “self-control, secure and trustable” strategy in cyberspace from “no security short board of the whole chain” to the guarantee of the absolute security of individual procedures or key components.

=== Security Concept ===
With the idea of the Moving Attack Surface, (MAS), the CMD system can be regarded as a kind of proactive defense system which deploys the multi-dimensional attack surface in an unpredictable way under the condition of visually-unchanged functions. Due to multiple-heterogeneity of structures and environments from each executive entity, it enables resources exploited by attackers (including lurkers) to have uncertainty in temporal and spatial dimensions. At the macro level, it appears that the attack surface is always making irregular movements. Especially for those attack missions which need multiple steps to transmit data to achieve attack goals, the premise of achievability can hardly be guaranteed.

=== Security Gain ===
Mimic defense gains (MDG) purely acquire nonlinear security gains through endogenous mechanisms of the framework. MDG in the mimic defense framework is endogenous. In mechanisms, there is no dependence on existing security defense technologies, such as encryption authentication, firewall filtering, virus detection, intrusion detection (Trojan removal), prevention, isolation and removal measures while traditional incremental means (vulnerability patching, backdoor blocking or malicious code removal, etc.) can be seen as supplementary measures to stabilize the defense effect. Besides, it has no real-time requirements for above technologies. However, the heterogeneous property of the Mimic system can be significantly enhanced with combination of these traditional security technologies, and results in improving the defensive capability of the object in a super nonlinear way.

== Technical Route ==
CMD has the following features. It integrates a variety of proactive defense elements technically as the concept. And the similarity and singularity of the target system are altered via heterogeneity and diversity while the static state and certainty of the target system are transformed through dynamic and stochastic means. Also it identifies and shields unknown defects and threats based on heterogeneous, redundant and multi-mode ruling mechanisms. Further, it enhances the flexibility or elasticity of the service function of the target system via high reliable architecture. Simultaneously, it defends or denies an uncertain threat to the target system depending on systems’ uncertain attributes. The above objectives can be achieved by a DHR-based and integrated technological framework.

== Mimic Defense Boundary ==
MDB (also abbreviated as Mimic Boundary) contains a number of service (operation) functions with normative definitions and strict agreements. Through consistency or conformance tests of these standardized protocols or specifications, we can determine the equivalence of multiple heterogeneous executive entities (complexity-unlimited) on given service (operation) functions or even performance. That is to say, the equivalence between functional executive entities, including the consistency of given exception handling functions or performance, can be judged via the consistency tests of the relationship between input and output through MDB. And the integrity, effectiveness and security of functions defined by MDB are a prerequisite for effective mimic defense, while functions (operations) not defined by MDB explicitly don’t belong to the scope of mimic defense (but there may exist a derived protective effect). In other words, if attackers do not make the output vectors inconsistent on the Mimic Boundary, the mimic mechanism won’t react. Therefore, it is essentially important to set, divide and choose MDB reasonably in engineering implementation. 
Specifically, security issues beyond MDB don’t belong to the scope of mimic defense. For example, security threats are caused by means which are independent of unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors or other factors within MDB, like fishing, bundling malicious functions in service software, pushing virus codes in cross-platform interpreted executive files and carrying toxic software through downloading behaviors from users.

=== Mimic Escape, ME ===
Mimic Escape refers to the process in which attackers make the heterogeneous redundant entities in MDB produce identical or mostly identical errors, thus breaking through the multi-mode arbitral mechanism and achieving the attack. Mimic Escape is an uncertain problem whose performance is not stable because of the DHR mechanism, and cannot be expressed by probability. More generally, “there is no second chance for a successful attack.”

=== Mimic Presentation, MP ===
Mimic Presentation refers to the visual relationship between the external service functions observed by attackers and the implementation structures of the object. The more complicated, less certainty and more diverse the relationship is, the more unpredictable the defensive behavior and environment of the object will be. Accordingly, the creation and maintenance of an attack chain will be more difficult, and the possibility of planning or deploying the attack will be lower. When the number and types of the heterogeneous redundant entities are determined, the levels of Mimic Presentation are strongly correlated to the scheduling and generation strategies for the set of executive entities.

== Mimic Defense Levels ==

=== Utter-Shielding Level ===
If the given MDB is facing an external invasion or “insider” attacks, protected functions, services and information are not affected and attackers can’t make any assessment on attack effectiveness, as if they fall into an “information black hole”, which is called the utter shielding level, the highest level of mimic defense.

=== Non-sustainable Level ===
If the given MDB is facing an external invasion or “insider” attacks, protected functions or information may make corrections after error-making or be self-healing with uncertain probability or duration. For attackers, even if they make a breakthrough, they hardly maintain attacks’ effects or can’t provide any meaningful basis for subsequent attacks, which is called the non-sustainable level.

=== Hard-reproducible Level ===
If the given MDB is facing an external invasion or “insider” attacks, protected functions or information may be out of control in a certain duration while it's hard to reproduce the same scene with repeating identical attacks. In other words, the attack scene or experience after a breakthrough can’t be inherited and lacks in utilized value in time dimension, which is called the hard-reproduced level.

=== Principles of Grading ===
More defense levels can be defined to meet comprehensive demands for security and implementation cost in different application scenarios. Four factors have to be taken into account regarding the security. The core of mimic defense is different-degree uncertainty on attack actions. The non-perceptive trait makes it impossible for attackers to acquire effective information of the defender at all stages of the attack chain. The non-sustainable feature enables the attack chain to lose its utilized stability. And the non-reproducible character makes it difficult to exploit experience based on accumulative probes and attacks as priori knowledge in the following attack missions.

== Applicable Field ==
Under the condition of the functional input-output relationship or meeting the IPO model, to solve the problem of service functions, performance and important information resources must be explicit and robust providing, insensitive to initial investment or product pricing, space or power consumption are acceptable and there are standard or standardized functional interfaces and protocol specifications and multiple or diverse processing conditions as well as occasions where the reliability and availability of the system or device are challenged by the traditional security and cyberspace non-traditional security. 
It should be pointed out that, under the above conditions, it is suitable to implement the mimic defense in any application where the target algorithm is determined and there are other equivalent algorithms. As the accuracy of results between different algorithms with function equivalence may be different (for example, the result is accurate to several decimal places.), or if the range of the control amount is a range, even if the problem is applied to a subject such as a scientific calculation or an application in an industrial control field, multi-mode decisions can also be made using a policy such as "precision mask" or "expected range".

== Mimic Phenomenon and Mimic Defense ==
The Mimic Phenomenon (MP) means that a creature simulates another creature or environment in color, texture, shape and other features so that one or both of the parties benefit from the ecological adaptation. From the perspective of the defender, it can be included in the category of active defense based on the endogenous mechanism, referred as Mimic Guise (MG). Besides the simulation in color, texture, shape and other features, we refer the simulation of behavior and state as Mimic Defense (MD). To be specific in cyberspace, under the premise of remaining unchanged in given functions and performance of an object, it can be transformed in space-time dimension strategically such as system architectures, operation processes, core algorithms, abnormal behavior and other environmental factors as well as unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors or Trojans, viruses which may exist in an attached mode . Accordingly, we refer this system and mechanism of defense as Cyber Mimic Defense (CMD).

== Dynamic Heterogeneous Redundancy Architecture (DHR) ==
DHR is a theoretical method of achieving mimic defense. It's based on a dissimilar redundancy structure (DRS) in the field of reliability and introduces the mechanism of dynamically multi-dimensional reconfiguration, which enables it not only have high reliability of DRS but also high security of mimic defense. We refer this heterogeneous redundant structure as a dynamic heterogeneous redundancy (DHR) architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jiangxing|first=WU|year=2016|title=Research on Cyber Mimic Defense|url=http://jcs.iie.ac.cn/ch/reader/create_pdf.aspx?file_no=20160401&amp;flag=1&amp;year_id=2016&amp;quarter_id=4|journal=Journal of Cyber Security|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Composition and Operating Process of DHR ===
[[File:DHR.jpg|thumb|DHR architecture]]
The architecture of DHR is composed of the input agent, a set of heterogeneous components, dynamic selection algorithms, a set of executive entities and multi-mode arbitrators. In the diagram, the set of heterogeneous components and dynamic selection algorithms support the dynamic reconstruction in multi-dimension, which makes the set of executive entities dynamic. Multiple kinds of sets in which heterogeneous components are functionally equivalent can be combined by the software and hardware of standardization in module collection. The inputs are conveyed from the agent to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; executive entities in set, represented as &lt;math&gt;A_1,A_2,...,A_n&lt;/math&gt; selected from the collection &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; in Dynamic selection algorithm. Finally, system outputs are provided from the arbitrating between the output vectors through the multi-mode arbitrator.

=== Mimic Bracket ===
In the DHR architecture, system inputs are conveyed from the input agent to every executive entity in the current set, and system outputs are provided from the arbitrating between the output vectors through the multi-mode arbitrator. We refer both of the input agent and multi-mode arbitrator as the Mimic Bracket (MB).

=== Mimic Defense Boundary in DHR ===
Mimic Bracket, the combination of the input agent and multi-mode arbitrator, is operated in independent physical or logical space but coordinated functionally. The Mimic Defense Boundary (MDB), also abbreviated for Mimic Boundary, is defined by the Mimic Bracket as a range of protection. MDB is usually a heterogeneous redundant environment operated with “toxics and Bacteria”, which contains unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors and other bugs of hardware and software or viruses, Trojans, and malicious codes. In this environment, heterogeneous executive entities under the condition of a certain functional input sequence, can give a complete consistent output sequence essentially.

=== The Anti-attack Feature of DHR ===
Firstly, the mechanisms of DHR can make the system show much uncertainty to the attacker within the controllable and cost acceptable range for the defender, which provides a powerful solution to security threats of the statically deterministic DRS. It can also force the inevitable human attack, different from the fault-error, into a risk control problem of minimum probability, which can normalize the threat of certainty or uncertainty into a reliability problem of stochastic failure according to the physical mechanism of DHR. Secondly, it is a big challenge to make precise cooperation between homogeneous redundant components according to the related researches. Hence the heterogeneous feature of DHR will make cooperation more difficult for attackers. Furthermore, dynamism and randomness can improve the uncertainty of multi-participatory actions with consistent or synergistic requirements. Last but not least, the multi-mode arbitrator significantly enhances the difficulty of cooperative attack under the condition of non-cooperation.

=== The Significance of DHR Construction ===
If the elements in the set of heterogeneous executive entities satisfying functional equivalence are scheduled in dynamic policies, or deploy the generalized dynamic technologies such as reconfiguration, recombination, reconstruction, redefinition, and virtualization themselves, we could simplify or weaken the harsh requirements of dissimilarity design accordingly in DRS. In the post-globalization era, this conclusion is  of great engineering significance for the application of trustability-uncontrollable components, including open source software, hardware or middleware and so on, to build a  safe and reliable system as well as to reduce the cost, in product life cycle over the open industrial chain and the supplying chain.

== Mimic Computing and Mimic Defense ==
Mimic computing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-DXKX201407002.htm|title=Meaning and Vision of Mimic Computing and Mimic Security Defense--《Telecommunications Science》2014年07期|website=en.cnki.com.cn|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; can dynamically select the solution structure environment adaptively, according to different tasks, different time, different loads, different performance requirements, different resource conditions and parameters. Mimic computing can improve processing efficiency with the benefit of structure variable computing based on active cognition.

Mimic Defense fully mines the structure variable computing on the mechanism of endogenous anti-attack properties. As the external appearance is dynamic and random, the Mimic Computing system seems to be in active jumping or rapid migration irregularly in the vision of attackers in the time-space dimension among the diverse environments. It shows strongly dynamic, heterogeneous, random and other uncertain characteristics, disturbing the observation and the prediction, which will increase the difficulty and cost of constructing the attack chain based on vulnerability and backdoors.

In summary, mimic computing and mimic defense are based on a computing and processing architecture in essence, which is structure-variable under the condition of functionally equivalence. With the full use of structure variable computing, mimic computing can improve processing efficiency and mimic defense can provide the ability of active defense.

== Differences from Moving Target Defense (MTD) ==

=== Different Technology Roadmaps === 
Mimic Defense is a kind of architectural technology derived from fault tolerance in the field of reliability. Its fundamental form evolved from static DRS served as fault tolerance to DHR applied in intrusion tolerance. However, MTD is inspired by the idea of Encryption and Scrambler, which typically makes the instruction, address, or data of systems dynamic, random and diverse in order to increase the level of efforts required to achieve a successful compromise.

=== Different Technical Systems ===
The technical implementation of Mimic Defense is based on DHR, which has the intensive property with functions, reliability and security trinity. It is not necessary to expose technical details of the functional equivalent components of heterogeneous redundant hardware and software. MTD is a purely defensive technique which belongs to the simple "stack" of the non-systematic discrete technique, and it is not transparent to the protective object.

=== Different Implementation Space ===
Mimic Defense emphasizes on the implementation of a DHR architecture, which is operated in independent physical or logical space and correlated weakly with the operating mechanism of shared resource. MTD depends on the operating mechanism of shared resources, usually coexisting in the same processing space with objects, which seriously affects the objective performance of services due to the cost of processing resources.

=== Different Implementation Approaches ===
In Mimic Defense, it is requested that the object has functionally equivalent implementation support from the diverse hardware and software components as redundant. That is, in the premise of not affecting the service performance, the way to improve the security is a trade of the software and hardware resources while MTD mainly uses software to realize dynamic changes, diversification and randomization in the case of certain resource, in exchange for security by consuming the resources of the objective system and reducing the performance of the services.

=== Different Degrees of Attack Difficulty ===
The classic method of Mimic Defense is intended to build the redundant working environment with multi-mode judging mechanisms, composed of multiple dynamic reconfigurable components in functionally equivalence. When the same input arrives at heterogeneous executive entities, the only consistent output is intuitively generated by the intersection of functions in these entities through the multi-mode judging process. Any attack based on the specific implementation of one entity, including the attacks to multiple entities simultaneously, is hard to bypass the mimic judging mechanism under the condition of non-cooperation and turns out to be a failure. So for the attackers, it is necessary to solve the problem including not only the accessibility of attack packets and the availability of vulnerabilities, but also to achieve the consistent error expression through the cooperative attack dilemma under the condition of non-cooperation in heterogeneous multi-target space. It can overcome the impact of so many uncertainties while MTD can not provide such degrees of difficulty for attackers.

=== Different Capabilities of Attack Tolerance ===
Based on the benefit from the DHR structure in functionally equivalence, Mimic Defense keeps the fault tolerance and intrusion tolerance property in MDB as long as consistent mistakes arise by falling from the majority of executive entities at the same time. MTD emphasizes the functional recovery after the compromise, which is called resilience and tenacity. Obviously, the protective effect of the former is much higher than that of the latter.

=== Different Defense Objects ===
Mimic Defense is effective not only in defending the external attacks based on unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors, front doors, trapdoors, and etc., but also against the unknown viruses, Trojans and other penetration attacks. However, MTD only considers the impact of the unknown vulnerabilities.

=== Different Application Modes ===
Due to the differences between the two technical systems and implementation approaches, Mimic Defense can use both of open source products and COTS black-boxes whose credibility cannot be ensured, but MTD excessively depends on white-boxes on the contrary. So the former can avoid the most tremendous trouble from technology promotion, with more inclusiveness, openness and attractiveness, and turns out to have greater prospects for commercial promotion and researches.

== Differences from [[Trusted Computing|Trustable Computing]] ==

=== Mimic defense doesn’t belong to the technology of computational complexity ===
Mimic defense can’t distinguish between right and wrong from the results itself, which is computed or operated by components of hardware and software. It just refers to the situation of consistency, arbitrated between responsive outputs which are produced by heterogeneous redundant entities from the same input excitation, as a basis of recognition under the condition of functional equivalence. It is usually a big probability event that most of the expressions are consistent. This is considered as the law of identification with normal or abnormal states although it is easy to prove both in theory and practice that consistent error existing in most expressions is a minimal probability event. The key of breaking through the Mimic Defense system is the solution on how to obtain the consistent errors in most entities, achieving the escape stably, under the condition of non-cooperation and DHR environment at the same time. Trustable Computing, could be considered as a technique of encryption and belongs to the category of computational complexity technology which is not the same as Mimic defense in security principles.

=== Mimic defense doesn’t have credibility problems of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) ===
The Mimic defense ruling refers to the majority or minority of outputs judged by the arbitrator, by using the relativity results as identification rules without any absolutely credible outputs except the correctness of the arbitrator. However, the "absolute security" of the Trusted Computing Base（TPM or TCM）is the fundamental of Trusted Computing, and is still controversial because of the unsettled problem that "who guarantees the credibility of TCB".

=== Mimic Defense is transparent to components of hardware and software ===
For heterogeneous redundancy components of hardware and software which are functionally equivalent in MDB, Mimic Defense does not need to make any analysis or customization and has only to operate in accordance with the process of the "black box" to directly apply  COTS-level products whose credibility cannot be ensured. It reduces the cost of the engineering during the realization of defensive techniques. While the object of Trusted Computing must have a degree of transparency so that analysis and intervention are inevitable during the process of implementation (often facing the hard situation in which there are only program files of executable codes), which brings a big challenge to the engineering implementation.

=== Mimic defense architecture have integrated functions ===
The Mimic defense architecture is intensive with functions. While providing active defense functions without priori knowledge, the system also gives service functions and the security function of high reliability. However, Trusted Computing only provides the security function and the function of fault detection in a certain level.

'''Dendroclimatology''' is the science of determining past [[climate]]s from [[tree]]s (primarily properties of the annual [[tree rings]]). Tree rings are wider when conditions favor growth, narrower when times are difficult. Other properties of the annual rings, such as maximum [[latewood]] density (MXD) have been shown to be better proxies than simple ring width. Using tree rings, scientists have estimated many local climates for hundreds to thousands of years previous.  By combining multiple tree-ring studies (sometimes with other climate [[proxy (climate)|proxy]] records), scientists have estimated past regional and global climates.

==Advantages==
Tree rings are especially useful as climate [[proxy (climate)|proxies]] in that they can be well-dated via [[dendrochronology]], i.e. matching of the rings from sample to sample.  This allows extension backwards in time using deceased tree samples, even using samples from buildings or from archeological digs.  Another advantage of tree rings is that they are clearly demarked in annual increments, as opposed to other proxy methods such as [[borehole]]s.  Furthermore, tree rings respond to multiple climatic effects (temperature, moisture, cloudiness), so that various aspects of climate (not just temperature) can be studied.  However, this can be a double-edged sword.

==Limitations==
Along with the advantages of dendroclimatology are some limitations:  [[confounding variable|confounding factors]], geographic coverage, annular resolution, and collection difficulties.  The field has developed various methods to partially adjust for these challenges. 

===Confounding factors===
There are multiple climate and non-climate factors as well as [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] effects that impact tree ring width.  Methods to isolate single factors (of interest) include botanical studies to calibrate growth influences and sampling of "limiting stands" (those expected to respond mostly to the variable of interest).

====Climate factors====
Climate factors that affect trees include temperature, precipitation, sunlight, and wind.  To differentiate among these factors, scientists collect information from "limiting stands."  An example of a limiting stand is the upper elevation treeline: here, trees are expected to be more affected by temperature variation (which is "limited") than precipitation variation (which is in excess).  Conversely, lower elevation treelines are expected to be more affected by precipitation changes than temperature variation.  This is not a perfect work-around as multiple factors still impact trees even at the "limiting stand," but it helps.  In theory, collection of samples from nearby limiting stands of different types (e.g. upper and lower treelines on the same mountain) should allow mathematical solution for multiple climate factors.  

====Non-climate factors====
Non-climate factors include soil, tree age, fire, tree-to-tree competition, genetic differences, logging or other human disturbance, herbivore impact (particularly sheep grazing), pest outbreaks, disease, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration.  For factors which vary randomly over space (tree to tree or stand to stand), the best solution is to collect sufficient data (more samples) to compensate for confounding noise.  Tree age is corrected for with various statistical methods:  either fitting spline curves to the overall tree record or using similar aged trees for comparison over different periods (regional curve standardization).  Careful examination and site selection helps to limit some confounding effects, for example picking sites undisturbed by modern man.

====Non-linear effects====
In general, climatologists assume a linear dependence of ring width on the variable of interest (e.g. moisture).  However, if the variable changes enough, response may level off or even turn opposite.  The home gardener knows that one can underwater or overwater a house plant.  In addition, it is possible that interaction effects may occur (for example "temperature times precipitation" may affect growth as well as temperature and precipitation on their own.  Here, also, the "limiting stand" helps somewhat to isolate the variable of interest.  For instance, at the upper treeline, where the tree is "cold limited", it's unlikely that nonlinear effects of high temperature ("inverted quadratic") will have numerically significant impact on ring width over the course of a growing season.

====Botanical inferences to correct for confounding factors====
Botanical studies can help to estimate the impact of confounding variables and in some cases guide corrections for them.  These experiments may be either ones where growth variables are all controlled (e.g. in a [[greenhouse]]{{cn|date=November 2012}}), partially controlled (e.g. FACE [Free Airborne Concentration Enhancement] experiments—add ref), or where conditions in nature are monitored.  In any case, the important thing is that multiple growth factors are carefully recorded to determine what impacts growth.  (Insert Fennoscandanavia paper reference).  With this information, ring width response can be more accurately understood and inferences from historic (unmonitored) tree rings become more certain.  In concept, this is like the limiting stand principle, but it is more quantitative—like a calibration.

====Divergence problem====
{{Main|Divergence problem}}
The divergence problem is the disagreement between the temperatures measured by the [[thermometer]]s (instrumental temperatures) on one side, and the temperatures reconstructed from the latewood density or width of tree rings on the other side, at many treeline sites in northern forests.

While the rendering and analysis of data from thermometer records largely suggest a substantial warming trend, tree rings from these particular sites do not display a corresponding change in their maximum latewood density or, in some cases, their width. This does not apply to all such studies.&lt;ref name=Darrigo&gt;{{cite journal | last = D'Arrigo  | first = Rosanne
| last2=Wilson | first2=Rob | last3=Liepert | first3=Beate | last4=Cherubini | first4=Paolo | title = On the ‘Divergence Problem’ in Northern Forests: A review of the tree-ring evidence and possible causes | journal = Global and Planetary Change | volume = 60 | pages = 289–305 | year = 2008 | url = http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~liepert/pdf/DArrigo_etal.pdf | doi = 10.1016/j.gloplacha.2007.03.004 | format =PDF |bibcode = 2008GPC....60..289D }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Where this applies, a temperature trend extracted from tree rings alone would not show any substantial warming.  The temperature graphs calculated from instrumental temperatures and from these tree ring proxies  thus "diverge" from one another since the 1950s, which is the origin of the term. This divergence raises obvious questions of whether other, unrecognized divergences have occurred in the past, prior to the era of thermometers. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Surface temperature reconstructions for the last 2,000 years |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C |year=2006 |isbn=0-309-10225-1 |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11676}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence suggesting that the divergence is caused by human activities, and so confined to the recent past, but use of affected proxies can lead to overestimation of past temperatures, understating the current warming trend. There is continuing research into explanations and ways to reconcile this the discrepancy between analysis of tree ring data and thermometer based data.&lt;ref name=Darrigo /&gt;

===Geographic coverage===
Trees do not cover the Earth. [[Polar climate|Polar]] and marine climates cannot be estimated from tree rings. In perhumid tropical regions, [[Australia]] and [[southern Africa]], trees generally grow all year round and don't show clear annual rings. In some forest areas, the tree growth is too much influenced by multiple factors (no "limiting stand") to allow clear climate reconstruction{{Examples|date=September 2011}}. The coverage difficulty is dealt with by acknowledging it and by using other proxies (e.g. ice cores, corals) in difficult areas.  In some cases it can be shown that the parameter of interest (temperature, precipitation, etc.) varies similarly from area to area, for example by looking at patterns in the instrumental record.  Then one is justified in extending the dendroclimatology inferences to areas where no suitable tree ring samples are obtainable.

===Annular resolution===
Tree rings show the impact on growth over an entire growing season.  Climate changes deep in the dormant season (winter) will not be recorded.  In addition, different times of the growing season may be more important than others (i.e. May versus September) for ring width.  However, in general the ring width is used to infer the overall climate change during the corresponding year (an approximation).  Another problem is "memory" or [[autocorrelation]].  A stressed tree may take a year or two to recover from a hard season.  This problem can be dealt with by more complex modeling (a "lag" term in the regression) or by reducing the skill estimates of chronologies.

===Collection difficulties===
Tree rings must be obtained from nature, frequently from remote regions.  This means that special efforts are needed to map sites properly.  In addition, samples must be collected in difficult (often sloping terrain) conditions.  Generally, tree rings are collected using a hand-held borer device, that requires skill to get a good sample.  The best samples come from felling a tree and sectioning it.  However, this requires more danger and does damage to the forest.  It may not be allowed in certain areas, particularly with the oldest trees in undisturbed sites (which are the most interesting scientifically).  As with all experimentalists, dendroclimatologists must, at times, decide to make the best of imperfect data, rather than resample.  This tradeoff is made more difficult, because sample collection (in the field) and analysis (in the lab) may be separated significantly in time and space.  These collection challenges mean that data gathering is not as simple or cheap as conventional laboratory science.

==Other measurements==
Initial work focused on measuring the [[tree ring]] width—this is simple to measure and can be related to climate parameters.  But the annual growth of the tree leaves other traces.  In particular ''maximum latewood density'' (MXD) is another metric used for estimating environmental variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brian H. |last=Luckman |title=Tree Rings as Temperature Proxies |format=PDF |work=2008 Gussow-Nuna Geoscience Conference |publisher=cspg.org |url=http://www.cspg.org/documents/Conventions/Archives/Gussow/2008Gussow/015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, harder to measure.  Other properties (e.g. isotope or chemical trace analysis) have also been tried most notably by L. M. Libby in her 1974 paper "Temperature Dependence of Isotope Ratios in Tree Rings".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Libby|Pandolfi|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In theory, multiple measurements on the same ring will allow differentiation of confounding factors (e.g. precipitation and temperature).  However, most studies are still based on ring widths at limiting stands.

Measuring [[Carbon-14|radiocarbon]] concentrations in tree rings has proven to be useful in recreating past [[sunspot]] activity, with data now extending back over 11,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The '''Design Structure Matrix''' ('''DSM'''; also referred to as '''dependency structure matrix''', '''dependency structure method''', '''dependency source matrix''', '''problem solving matrix (PSM)''', '''incidence matrix''', '''''N&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' matrix''', '''interaction matrix''', '''dependency map''' or '''design precedence matrix''') is a simple, compact and visual representation of a system or project in the form of a square [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].&lt;ref name="DSMbook"&gt;S.D. Eppinger and T.R. Browning, [http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-structure-matrix-methods-and-applications Design Structure Matrix Methods and Applications], MIT Press, Cambridge, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the equivalent of an [[adjacency matrix]] in [[graph theory]], and is used in [[systems engineering]] and [[project management]] to model the structure of complex systems or processes, in order to perform system analysis, project planning and organization design. [[Don Steward]] coined the term "design structure matrix" in the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;D. V. Steward: ''The Design Structure System: A Method for Managing the Design of Complex Systems.'' In: ''IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management.'' 28(3), 1981, S. 71-74.&lt;/ref&gt; using  the  matrices to solve mathematical systems of equations.

== Overview ==
A design structure matrix lists all constituent [[subsystem]]s/[[Activity diagram|activities]] and the corresponding [[information exchange]], interactions, and dependency [[Pattern recognition|patterns]]. For example, where the matrix elements represent activities, the matrix details what pieces of information are needed to start a particular activity, and shows where the information generated by that activity leads. In this way, one can quickly recognize which other activities are reliant upon information outputs generated by each activity.

The use of DSMs in both research and industrial practice increased greatly in the 1990s.  DSMs have been applied in the building construction, real estate development, semiconductor, automotive, photographic, aerospace, telecom, small-scale manufacturing, factory equipment, and electronics industries, to name a few, as well as in many government agencies.&lt;ref name="DSMbook"/&gt;

The matrix representation has several strengths.  
* The matrix can represent a large number of [[Systems theory|system]] elements and their relationships in a compact way that highlights important patterns in the data (such as [[feedback loop]]s and modules).
* The presentation is amenable to matrix-based analysis techniques, which can be used to improve the structure of the system.
* In modeling activities precedence it allows representing  feedback linkages that cannot be modeled by [[Gantt chart]]/[[Program evaluation and review technique|PERT]] modeling techniques &lt;ref&gt;Browning TR, Fricke E, Negele H (2006) [http://sbuweb.tcu.edu/tbrowning/Publications/Browning%20Fricke%20Negele%20(2006)--Process%20Modeling%20Concepts.pdf "Key Concepts in Modeling Product Development Processes"], Systems Engineering, 9(2):104-128&lt;/ref&gt;

DSM analysis provides insights into how to manage complex systems or projects, highlighting [[information flow]]s, task/activities sequences and [[iteration]].&lt;ref name="DSMbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="complex"&gt;Yassine A, Braha D (2003),[http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/CERA.pdf "Complex Concurrent Engineering and the Design Structure Matrix Approach."] Concurrent Engineering: Research and Applications, 11(3):165-177&lt;/ref&gt; It can help teams to streamline their processes based on the optimal flow of information between different interdependent activities.

DSM analysis can also be used to manage the effects of a change. For example, if the specification for a component had to be changed, it would be possible to quickly identify all processes or activities which had been dependent on that specification, reducing the [[Risk management|risk]] that work continues based on out-of-date information.&lt;ref name="DSMbook"/&gt;

==DSM Structure==
A DSM is a [[square matrix]], representing linkages between the system elements. The system elements are often labeled in the rows to the left of the matrix and/or in the columns above the matrix. These elements can represent for example product components, organization teams, or project activities.

The off-diagonal cells are used to indicate relationships between the elements. A marking of the cell indicates a directed link between two elements and can represent design relations or constraints between product components, communication between teams, information flow or precedence relations between activities. In one convention, reading across a row reveals the outputs that the element in that row provides to other elements, and scanning a column reveals the inputs that the element in that column receives from other elements. For example, in the DSM, the marking in row A and column C indicated a link from A to C (output from A, input to C). Alternatively, the rows and columns may be switched (without a change of meaning).  Both conventions may be found in the literature.&lt;ref name="DSMbook"/&gt;

The cells along the diagonal are typically used to represent the system elements. However, the diagonal cells can be used for representing self-iterations (e.g., rework of a code that did not pass its unit testing). Self-iterations are required when a matrix element represents a block of activities/subsystems that may be further detailed, allowing hierarchical DSM structure.&lt;ref&gt;A. Karniel and Y. Reich, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4255493_Simulating_Design_Processes_with_self-iteration_activities_based_on_DSM_planning “Simulating Design Processes with self-iteration activities based on DSM planning,”] in Proceedings of the International Conference on Systems Engineering and Modeling - ICSEM'07, Haifa, 2007. &lt;/ref&gt;

Two main categories of DSMs have been proposed:  static and time-based.&lt;ref name="DSMreview"&gt;T. Browning: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/17.946528 "Applying the Design Structure Matrix to System Decomposition and Integration Problems: A Review and New Directions."] In: ''IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management.'' 48(3):292-306, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
Static DSMs represent systems where all of the elements exist simultaneously, such as components of a machine or groups in an organization. A static DSM is equivalent to an ''N&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' chart or an [[adjacency matrix]]. The marking in the off-diagonal cells is often largely symmetrical to the diagonal (e.g., in an organizational DSM indicating interactions between teams, there are both a mark from team C to team E and a mark from team E to team C, thus indicating that interactions are mutual). Static DSMs are usually analyzed with [[Cluster analysis|clustering algorithms]].

A time-based DSM is akin to a [[precedence diagram]] or the matrix representation of a [[directed graph]]. In time-based DSMs, the ordering of the rows and columns indicates a flow through time:  earlier activities in a process appear in the upper-left of the DSM and later activities appear in the lower-right. Terms like “feedforward” and “feedback” become meaningful when referring to interfaces. A feedback mark is an above-diagonal mark (when rows represent output). Time-based DSMs are typically analyzed using sequencing algorithms, that reorder the matrix elements to minimize the amount of feedback marks, and make them as close as possible to the diagonal.&lt;ref name="DSMbook"/&gt;

DSM matrices were categorized to Component-based or Architecture DSM; People-based (Team-based) or Organization DSM, both considered as Static (representing existing elements).  Activity-based or Schedule DSM and Parameter-based DSM are defined as time-based, as their ordering implies flow.

===DSM marking===
Initially, the off-diagonal cell markings indicated only the existence/non-existence of an interaction (link) between elements, using a symbol (or the figure '1'). Such marking is defined as '''Binary DSM'''. The marking then has developed to indicate quantitative relation '''Numeric DSM''' indicating the "strength" of the linkage, or statistical relations '''Probability DSM''' indicating for example the probability of applying new information (that require reactivation of the linked activity).&lt;ref name="complex"/&gt;

==DSM algorithms==
The DSM algorithms are used for reordering the matrix elements subject to some criteria. Static DSMs are usually analyzed with [[Cluster analysis|clustering algorithms]] (i.e., reordering the matrix elements in order to group together related elements). Clustering results would typically show groups (clusters) of tightly related elements, and elements that are either not connected or are connected to many other elements and therefore are not part of a group.&lt;ref name="DSMbook"/&gt; 
 
Time-based DSMs are typically analyzed using partitioning, tearing and sequencing algorithms.&lt;ref name="DSMbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="complex"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Karniel and Y. Reich, [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-0-85729-570-5_3 "Design process planning using DSM"], in Managing the Dynamics of New Product Development Processes: A New Product Lifecycle Management Paradigm, Springer, 2011 &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sequencing''' methods try to order the matrix elements such that no feedback marks remain.&lt;ref name="DSMbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="complex"/&gt; In case of coupled activities (activities that have cyclic links, e.g., activity A is linked to B, which is linked to C, which is linked to A) the results is a block diagonal DSM (i.e., blocks or groups of coupled activities along the diagonal). Partitioning methods include: Path Searching; Reachability Matrix; Triangulation algorithm; and the powers of the Adjacency Matrix.

'''Tearing''' is the removal of feedback marks (in Binary DSM) or assignment of lower priority (numeric DSM). Tearing of a Component-based DSM may imply modularization (the component design is not influencing other components) or standardization (the component design is not influencing and not influenced by other components).&lt;ref name="DSMbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="complex"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sered Y, Reich Y (2006)," Standardization and modularization driven by minimizing overall process effort." Computer-Aided Design, 38(5):405-416&lt;/ref&gt; After tearing a partitioning algorithm is (re)applied.

Minimizing feedback loops gets the best results for Binary DSM, but not always for Numeric DSM or Probability DSM. '''Sequencing''' algorithms (using optimization, genetic algorithms) are typically trying to minimize the number of feedback loops and also to reorder coupled activities (having cyclic loop) trying to have the feedback marks close to the diagonal. Yet, sometimes the algorithm just tries to minimize a criterion (where minimum iterations is not the optimal results).&lt;ref name="DSMsim"&gt;T. Browning: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TEM.2002.806709 "Modeling Impacts of Process Architecture on Cost and Schedule Risk in Product Development"], In: ''IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management.'' 49(4):428-442, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use and extensions==
Interactions between various aspects (people, activities, and components) is done using additional (non-square) linkage matrices. The Multiple Domain Matrix (MDM) is an extension of the basic DSM structure.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer M (2007) Structural Awareness in complex product design. Dissertation, Technischen Universität München, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; A MDM includes several DSMs (ordered as block diagonal matrices) that represent the relations between elements of the same domain; and corresponding Domain Mapping Matrices (DMM) &lt;ref&gt;M. Danilovic; T. R. Browning: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10951-009-0131-y "Managing Complex Product Development Projects with Design Structure Matrices and Domain Mapping Matrices"]. In: ''International Journal of Project Management.''  25(3), 2007, S. 300-314.&lt;/ref&gt;  that represent relations between elements of different domains.

The use of DSM has been extended to visualize and optimize the otherwise invisible information flow and interactions associated with office work.  This visualization via DSM allows the Lean Body of Knowledge to be applied to office and information intensive flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Far From the Factory: Lean for the Information Age|year=2010|publisher=Productivity Press|location=New York|isbn=1420094564|pages=159–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM method was applied as a framework for analyzing the propagation of rework in product development processes, and the related problem of convergence (or divergence) using the theory of linear dynamical systems.&lt;ref name="complex"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith R, Eppinger S (1997) “Identifying controlling features of engineering design iteration.” Management Science 43(3):276–293. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Yassine A, Joglekar N, Braha D,  Eppinger S, and Whitney D (2003),"Information hiding in product development: the design churn effect." Research in Engineering Design, 14(3): 131-144.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernst Karl Abbe''' [[FRMS|HonFRMS]] (23 January 1840 – 14 January 1905) was a [[Germany|German]] [[physicist]], [[optical engineering|optical scientist]], [[entrepreneur]], and social reformer. Together with [[Otto Schott]] and [[Carl Zeiss]], he laid the foundation of modern [[optics]]. Abbe developed numerous optical instruments. He was a co-owner of [[Carl Zeiss AG]], a German manufacturer of research microscopes, astronomical telescopes, planetariums and other optical systems.

== Personal life ==
[[File:Else Abbe.png|thumb|left|Else Snell]]
Abbe was born 23 January 1840 in [[Eisenach]], [[Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]],&lt;ref name="NDB"&gt;{{harvnb|Blasius|1953|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Georg Adam Abbe and Elisabeth Christina Barchfeldt.&lt;ref name=wws&gt;{{harvnb|Debus|Calinger|Collins|Kennedy|1968|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came from a humble home — his father was a foreman in a spinnery. Supported by his father's employer, Abbe was able to attend secondary school and to obtain the general qualification for university entrance with fairly good grades, at the Eisenach Gymnasium, which he graduated from in 1857.&lt;ref name =gu/&gt; By the time he left school, his scientific talent and his strong will had already become obvious. Thus, in spite of the family's strained financial situation, his father decided to support Abbe's studies at the Universities of [[University of Jena|Jena]] (1857–1859) and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] (1859–1861).&lt;ref name="NDB"/&gt; During his time as a student, Abbe gave private lessons to improve his income. His father's employer continued to fund him. Abbe was awarded his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Göttingen on 23 March 1861.&lt;ref name=gu&gt;{{harvnb|Günther|1970|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at school, he was influenced by [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]], who also happened to be one of the [[Göttingen Seven]].&lt;ref name=gu2&gt;{{harvnb|Günther|1970|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by two short assignments at the Göttingen [[observatory]] and at Physikalischer Verein in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] (an association of citizens interested in physics and chemistry that was founded by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] in 1824 and still exists today).&lt;ref name=gu2/&gt; On 8 August 1863 he qualified as a university lecturer at the University of Jena. In 1870, he accepted a contract as an associate [[professor]] of experimental [[physics]], [[mechanics]] and [[mathematics]] in Jena.&lt;ref name="NDB"/&gt;&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, he married Else Snell, daughter of the mathematician and physicist Karl Snell, one of Abbe's teachers,{{refn|group=nb|Some sources give his wife's name as Elisabeth.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt;}} with whom he had two daughters.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; He attained full professor status by 1879.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; He became director of the [[Jena Observatory|Jena astronomical and meteorological observatory]] in 1878.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|The dates of his job appointments at the University of Jena, including his appointment as director of the Jena Observatory has some uncertainty, as sources give different dates, as following. 1870: assistant lecturer on mechanics and experimental physics; 1873: associate professor; 1877: director of the Jena Observatory meteorological and astronomy departments.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt;}} In 1889, he became a member of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]. He also was a member of the Saxon Academy of Sciences. He was relieved of his teaching duties at the University of Jena in 1891. Abbe died 14 January 1905 in Jena.&lt;ref name="NDB"/&gt; He was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph McCabe (1945). A Biographical Dictionary of Ancient, Medieval, and Modern Freethinkers. Haldeman-Julius Publications. Retrieved 7 April 2013. He was not only a distinguished German physicist and one of the most famous inventors on the staff at the Zeiss optical works at Jena but a notable social reformer, By a generous scheme of profit-sharing he virtually handed over the great Zeiss enterprise to the workers. Abbe was an intimate friend of Haeckel and shared his atheism (or Monism). Leonard Abbot says in his life of Ferrer that Abbe had "just the same ideas and aims as Ferrer."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abbe-Grab kl.jpg|thumb|upright|Ernst Abbe, relief at his grave]]In 1866, he became a research director at the [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss Optical Works]], and in 1886 he invented the [[Apochromat|apochromatic lens]], a microscope lens which eliminates both the primary and secondary color distortion.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; By 1870, Abbe invented the [[Abbe condenser]], used for microscope illumination.&lt;ref name =EB/&gt; In 1871, he designed the first [[refractometer]], which he described in a booklet published in 1874.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abbe|1874}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He developed the laws of image of non-luminous objects by 1872.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; Zeiss Optical Works began selling his improved microscopes in 1872, by 1877 they were selling microscopes with homogenous immersion objective, and in 1886 his apochromatic objective microscopes were being sold.&lt;ref name=pf&gt;{{harvnb|Pfeiffer|1991|p=445}}&lt;/ref&gt; He created the [[Abbe number]], a measure of any [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] material's variation of [[refractive index]] with [[wavelength]] and Abbe's criterion, which tests the hypothesis, that a systematic trend exists in a set of observations (in terms of resolving power this criterion stipulates that an angular separation cannot be less than the ratio of the wavelength to the aperture diameter, see [[angular resolution]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Joint Committee of Civil Engineers, American Congress on Surveying and Mapping, and American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already a professor in [[Jena]], he was hired by [[Carl Zeiss]] to improve the manufacturing process of optical instruments, which back then was largely based on trial and error.

Abbe was the first to define the term [[numerical aperture]],&lt;ref name="NA Est"&gt;{{harvnb|Abbe|1881}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the sine of the half angle multiplied by the refractive index of the medium filling the space between the cover glass and front lens.

Abbe is credited by many for discovering the resolution limit of the microscope, and the formula (published in 1873)

{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;d = \frac{\lambda}{2 NA}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq. 1}}}}

although in a publication in 1874 by [[Helmholtz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helmholtz|Fripp|1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; (another early appearance of this formula), [[Helmholtz]] states this formula was first derived by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], who had died 61 years prior. Helmholtz was so impressed as to offer a professorship at the [[University of Berlin]], which he refused due to his ties to Zeiss.&lt;ref name=gu2/&gt; Abbe was in the camp of the wide aperturists, arguing that microscopic resolution is ultimately limited by the aperture of the optics, but also argued that depending on application there are other parameters that should be weighted over the aperture in the design of objectives. In Abbe's 1874 paper, titled "A Contribution to the Theory of the Microscope and the nature of Microscopic Vision",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abbe|1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbe states that the resolution of a microscope is inversely dependent on its aperture, but without proposing a formula for the resolution limit of a microscope.

In 1876, Abbe was offered a partnership by Zeiss and began to share in the considerable profits.&lt;ref name=gu2/&gt; Although the first theoretical derivations of {{EquationNote|Eq. 1}} were published by others, it is fair to say that Abbe was the first to reach this conclusion experimentally. In 1878, he built the first homogenous immersion system for the microscope.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; The objectives that the Abbe Zeiss collaboration were producing were of ideal ray geometry, allowing Abbe to find that the aperture sets the upper limit of microscopic resolution, not the curvature and placement of the lenses. Abbe's first publication of {{EquationNote|Eq. 1}} occurred in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abbe|1883}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this publication, Abbe states that both his theoretical and experimental investigations confirmed {{EquationNote|Eq. 1}}. Abbe's contemporary Henry Edward Fripp, English translator of Abbe's and Helmholtz's papers, puts their contributions on equal footing. He also perfected the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference method]] by [[Fizeau]], in 1884.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; Abbe, Zeiss, Zeiss' son, [[Roderich Zeiss]], and [[Otto Schott]] formed, in 1884, [[Schott AG|Jenaer Glaswerk Schott &amp; Genossen]]. This company, which in time would in essence merge with Zeiss Optical Works, was responsible for research and production of 44 initial types of optical glass.&lt;ref name=pf/&gt; Working with [[telescope]]s, he built image reversal system in 1895.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt;

In                                     order to produce high quality objectives, Abbe made significant contributions to the diagnosis and correction of [[optical aberration]]s, both [[spherical aberration]] and [[coma aberration]], which is required for an objective to reach the resolution limit of {{EquationNote|Eq. 1}}. In addition to spherical aberration, Abbe discovered that the rays in optical systems must have constant angular magnification over their angular distribution to produce a diffraction limited spot, a principle known as the [[Abbe sine condition]].&lt;ref name="NA Est"/&gt; So monumental and advanced were Abbe's calculations and achievements that [[Frits Zernike]] based his [[Phase contrast microscopy|phase contrast]] work on them, for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1953, and [[Hans Busch (physicist)|Hans Busch]] used them to work on the development of the [[electron microscope]].&lt;ref name=gu2/&gt;

During his association with [[Carl Zeiss]]' [[microscope]] works, not only was he at the forefront of the field of optics but also labor reform as he also, in 1900, introduced the [[Eight hour day|eight-hour workday]], in remembrance of the 14-hour workday of his own father.&lt;ref name=pf/&gt; In addition, he created a pension fund and a discharge compensation fund.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; In 1889, Ernst Abbe set up and endowed the [[Carl Zeiss Foundation]] for research in science.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; The aim of the foundation was "to secure the economic, scientific, and technological future and in this way to improve the job security of their employees."&lt;ref name=pf/&gt; He made it a point that the success of an employee was based solely on their ability and performance, not on their origin, religion, or political views.&lt;ref name=pf/&gt; In 1896, he reorganized the Zeiss optical works into a cooperative with profit-sharing.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; His social views were so respected as to be used by the [[Prussia]]n state as a model and idealized by [[Alfred Weber]] in the 1947 book ''Schriften der Heidelberger Aktionsgruppe zur Demokratie und Zum Freien Sozialismus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Günther|1970|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crater [[Abbe (crater)|Abbe]] on the [[Moon]] was named in his honour.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[File:Map-of-Oz.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the [[land of Oz]], the fictional realm that is the setting for [[L. Frank Baum]]'s "[[List of Oz books|Oz]]" series.]]
A '''fictional universe''' is a [[consistency|self-consistent]] [[setting (narrative)|setting]] with events, and often other elements, that differ from the real world. It may also be called an imagined, constructed or fictional realm (or world). Fictional universes may appear in [[novel]]s, [[comics]], [[film]]s, [[Television program|television shows]], [[video game]]s, and other creative works.

A fictional universe can be almost indistinguishable from the real world, except for the presence of the invented [[character (arts)|character]]s and events that characterize a work of fiction; at the other extreme, it can bear little or no resemblance to the real world, with invented fundamental principles of time and space.

The subject is most commonly addressed in reference to fictional universes that differ markedly from the real world, such as those that introduce entire fictional cities, countries, or even planets, or those that contradict commonly known facts about the world and its history, or those that feature fantasy or [[science fiction]] concepts such as [[Magic in fiction|magic]] or [[faster than light]] travel—and especially those in which the deliberate development of the setting is a substantial focus of the work.

==Definition==
What distinguishes a fictional universe from a simple setting is the level of detail and internal consistency. A fictional universe has an established continuity and internal logic that must be adhered to throughout the work and even across separate works. So, for instance, many books may be set in conflicting fictional versions of [[Victorian London]], but all the stories of [[Sherlock Holmes]] are set in ''the same'' Victorian London. However, the [[Adaptations of Sherlock Holmes|various film series based on Sherlock Holmes]]  follow their own separate continuities, thus not taking place in the same fictional universe.

The history and geography of a fictional universe are well defined, and maps and timelines are often included in works set within them. Even new [[fictional language|languages]] may be constructed. When subsequent works are written within the same universe, care is usually taken to ensure that established facts of the [[canon (fiction)|canon]] are not violated. Even if the fictional universe involves concepts such as elements of magic that don't exist in the real world, these must adhere to a set of rules established by the author.

A famous example of a detailed fictional universe is [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] (more popularly known as [[Middle-earth]]), of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s books ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.  He created first its [[Languages of Arda|languages]] and then the world itself, which he states was "primarily linguistic in inspiration and was begun in order to provide the necessary 'history' for the Elvish tongues."&lt;ref&gt;Foreword to ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', by J.R.R. Tolkien&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern example of a [[Fictional universe of Avatar|fictional universe]] is that of the ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' film series, as [[James Cameron]] has invented an entire [[Pandoran biosphere|ecosystem]], with a team of scientists to test whether it was viable. Additionally, he commissioned a linguistics expert to invent the [[Na'vi language|''Na'vi'' language]].

Virtually every successful fictional [[TV series]] or [[comic book]] develops its own "universe" to keep track of the various episodes or issues. Writers for that series must follow the ''[[Bible (writing)|story bible]]'',&lt;ref name="jane"&gt;[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000550.php How to Give Maris Hives, Alphabetized] (April 2008), a blog entry by scriptwriter [[Jane Espenson]]&lt;/ref&gt; which often becomes the series canon.

Frequently, when a series is perceived by its creators as too complicated or too self-inconsistent (because of, for example, too many writers), the producers or publishers may introduce [[retroactive continuity]] (retcon) to make future editions easier to write and more consistent. This creates an alternate universe that future authors can write about. These stories about the universe or universes that existed before the retcon are usually not canonical, unless the franchise-holder gives permission. ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' was an especially sweeping example.

Some writers choose to introduce elements or characters from one work into another, to present the idea that both works are set in the same universe. For example, the character of [[Ursula Buffay]] from American [[sitcom]] ''[[Mad About You]]'' was also a recurring guest star in ''[[Friends]]'', despite the two series having little else in common. Fellow NBC series ''[[Seinfeld]]'' also contained [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] references to ''Mad About You''. [[L. Frank Baum]] introduced the characters of [[Cap'n Bill]] and [[Trot (Oz)|Trot]] (from ''[[The Sea Fairies]]'') into the Oz series in ''[[The Scarecrow of Oz]]'', and they made a number of appearances in later Oz books. In science fiction, [[A. Bertram Chandler]] introduced into his future Galactic civilization the character [[Dominic Flandry]] from [[Poul Anderson]]'s quite different Galactic future (he had Anderson's consent) – on the assumption that these were two [[alternate history]] timelines and that people could on some occasions cross from one to the other.

==Scope==
[[Sir Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' is one of the earliest examples of a cohesive fictional world with its own rules and functional concepts, but it comprises only one small island. Later fictional universes, like [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan the Cimmerian]]'' stories or [[Lev Grossman]]'s [[Fillory]], are global in scope and some, like ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Honorverse]]'', ''[[BattleTech]]'', or the [[Lensman series]], are galactic or even intergalactic.

A fictional universe may even concern itself with more than one interconnected universe through fictional devices such as dreams, "[[time travel]]" or "parallel worlds". Such a series of interconnected universes is often called a [[parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]]. Such multiverses have been featured prominently in science fiction since at least the mid-20th century.

The classic ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode "[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]]" introduced the [[Mirror Universe (Star Trek)|Mirror Universe]], in which the crew members of the [[Starship Enterprise|Starship ''Enterprise'']] were brutal rather than compassionate. The 2009 movie ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' created an "alternate reality" and freed the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[media franchise|franchise]] from [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] issues. In the mid-1980s, [[DC Comics]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' streamlined its fictional continuity by destroying most of its alternate universes.

==Format==
A fictional universe can be contained in a single work, as in [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' or [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'', or in [[serial (literature)|serial]]ized, [[book series|series]]-based, open-ended or [[Round-robin story|round robin]]-style fiction.

In most small-scale fictional universes, general properties and [[timeline]] events fit into a consistently organized [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]]. However, in the case of universes that are rewritten or revised by different [[writer]]s, [[editing|editors]], or [[Film producers|producer]]s, this continuity may be violated, by accident or by design.

The occasional publishing use of retroactive continuity ([[retcon]]) often occurs due to this kind of revision or oversight. Members of [[fandom]] often create a kind of [[fan-made]] canon ([[canon (fiction)#Nature of fictional canons|fanon]]) to patch up such errors; "fanon" that becomes generally accepted sometimes becomes actual canon. Other fan-made additions to a universe ([[fan fiction]], [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]], [[pastiche]], [[parody]]) are usually not considered canonical unless they get [[authorization|authorized]].

==Collaboration==
{{see also|Shared universe}}

Shared universes often come about when a fictional universe achieves great commercial success and attracts other media. For example, a successful movie may catch the attention of various book authors, who wish to write stories based on that movie. Under U.S. law, the copyright-holder retains control of all other [[derivative work]]s, including those written by other authors, but they might not feel comfortable in those other mediums or may feel that other individuals will do a better job; therefore, they may open up the copyright on a shared-universe basis. The degree to which the copyright-holder or [[franchise (media)|franchise]] retains control is often one of the points in the [[license agreement#Intellectual property|license agreement]].

For example, the comic book ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' was so popular that it spawned over 30 different radio, television, and movie series and a similar number of [[video game]]s, as well as theme park rides, books, and songs. In the other direction, both ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Wars'' are responsible for hundreds of books and games of varying levels of canonicity.

Fictional universes are sometimes shared by multiple prose authors, with each author's works in that universe being granted approximately equal canonical status. For example, [[Larry Niven]]'s fictional universe [[Known Space]] has an approximately 135-year period in which Niven allows other authors to write stories about the [[Man-Kzin Wars]]. Other fictional universes, like the [[Ring of Fire series|''Ring of Fire'' series]], actively court canonical [[The Grantville Gazettes|stimulus from fans]], but gate and control the  changes through a formalized process and the final say of [[Eric Flint|the editor and universe creator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =''[[Grantville Gazette III]]'' | others = [[Thomas Kidd (illustrator)|Thomas Kidd]] (cover art) | ISBN = 978-1-4165-0941-7 |id={{ISBN|1-4165-0941-0}} | publisher = [[Baen Books]] | last = [[Eric Flint|Flint, Eric]] and various others | pages = 311–313|quote=The print published and e-published Grantville Gazettes all contain a post book [[afterword]] detailing where and how to submit a manuscript to the fictional canon oversight process for the [[1632 series]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other universes are created by one or several authors but are intended to be used non-canonically by others, such as the fictional settings for [[game]]s, particularly [[role-playing game]]s and video games. Settings for the role-playing game ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' are called [[campaign setting]]s; other games have also incorporated this term on occasion. [[Virtual world]]s are fictional worlds in which [[online]] computer games, notably [[MMORPG]]s and [[MUD]]s, take place. A [[fictional crossover]] occurs when two or more [[fictional character]]s, series or universes cross over with one another, usually in the context of a character created by one author or owned by one [[company (law)|company]] meeting a character created or owned by another. In the case where two fictional universes covering entire ''actual'' universes cross over, physical travel from one universe to another may actually occur in the course of the story. Such crossovers are usually, but not always, considered non-canonical by their creators or by those in charge of the [[intellectual property|properties]] involved.

[[Image:LippewerkKraftwerk.JPG|thumb|300px|Oldest power station utilizing circular fluidised bed technology, in [[Lünen]], Germany]]  
A '''fluidised bed''' is a physical phenomenon occurring when a quantity of a [[solid]] particulate substance (usually present in a holding vessel) is placed under appropriate conditions to cause a solid/fluid mixture to behave as a [[fluid]]. This is usually achieved by the introduction of pressurized fluid through the particulate medium. This results in the medium then having many properties and characteristics of normal fluids, such as the ability to free-flow under gravity, or to be pumped using fluid type technologies.

The resulting phenomenon is called [[fluidisation]]. Fluidised beds are used for several purposes, such as [[fluidized bed reactor]]s (types of [[chemical reactor]]s), solids separation&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aic.15420  |title= A simple model for predicting solid concentration distribution in binary‐solid liquid fluidized beds |publisher=AIChE Journal |last1=Peng |first1= Z. |last2=Moghtaderi| first2= B. |last3=Doroodchi |first3= E. | year=2017 |page= 469:484 | doi= 10.1002/aic.15420}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[fluid catalytic cracking]], [[fluidized bed combustion]], heat or mass transfer or interface modification, such as applying a [[coating]] onto solid items. This technique is also becoming more common in [[aquaculture]] for the production of shellfish in integrated multi-trophic aquaculture systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecaa.ntu.edu.tw/weifang/sysEng/microalgae-based%20recirculating%20oyster%20and%20shrimp%20system.pdf Wang, JK, 2003. Conceptual design of a microalgae-based recirculating oyster and shrimp system. Aquacultural Engineering 28, 37-46]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
A fluidised bed consists of fluid-solid mixture that exhibits fluid-like properties. As such, the upper surface of the bed is relatively horizontal, which is analogous to hydrostatic behavior. The bed can be considered to be a heterogeneous mixture of fluid and solid that can be represented by a single bulk density.

Furthermore, an object with a higher density than the bed will sink, whereas an object with a lower density than the bed will float, thus the bed can be considered to exhibit the fluid behavior expected of [[Archimedes' principle]]. As the "density", (actually the solid volume fraction of the suspension), of the bed can be altered by changing the fluid fraction, objects with different densities comparative to the bed can, by altering either the fluid or solid fraction, be caused to sink or float.

In fluidised beds, the contact of the solid particles with the fluidisation medium (a gas or a liquid) is greatly enhanced when compared to [[packed bed]]s. This behavior in fluidised combustion beds enables good thermal transport inside the system and good heat transfer between the bed and its container. Similarly to the good heat transfer, which enables thermal uniformity analogous to that of a well mixed gas, the bed can have a significant heat-capacity whilst maintaining a homogeneous temperature field.

== Application ==
Fluidised beds are used as a technical process which has the ability to promote high levels of contact between gases and solids. In a fluidised bed a characteristic set of basic properties can be utilised, indispensable to modern process and chemical engineering, these properties include:  

*Extremely high surface area contact between fluid and solid per unit bed volume
*High relative velocities between the fluid and the dispersed solid phase.
*High levels of intermixing of the particulate phase.
*Frequent particle-particle and particle-wall collisions.

Taking an example from the food processing industry: fluidised beds are used to accelerate freezing in some [[frozen food|individually quick frozen (IQF) tunnel freezers]]. These fluidised bed tunnels are typically used on small food products like peas, shrimp or sliced vegetables, and may use [[cryogenic]] or [[vapor-compression refrigeration]]. The fluid used in fluidised beds may also contain a fluid of catalytic type; that's why it is also used to catalyse the chemical reaction and also to improve the rate of reaction.

Fluidised beds are also used for efficient bulk drying of materials. Fluidised bed technology in dryers increases efficiency by allowing for the entire surface of the drying material to be suspended and therefore exposed to the air. This process can also be combined with heating or cooling, if necessary, according to the specifications of the application.

== History ==
In 1922, Fritz Winkler made the first industrial application of fluidisation in a reactor for a [[coal gasification]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FDbB7VjxkQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22Fritz%20Winkler%22%20Coal%20Gasification&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=SA5-PA71#v=onepage&amp;q=Fritz%20winkler&amp;f=false  |title= Multiphase Flow Handbook |publisher=CRC Press | contribution= Fluidised Beds |last1=Grace |first1= John R. |last2=Leckner| first2= Bo |last3=Zhu |first3= Jesse |last4=Cheng |first4= Yi |editor=Clayton T.

In the 1960s VAW-Lippewerk in Lünen, Germany implemented the first industrial bed for the combustion of coal and later for the calcination of aluminium hydroxide.

== Fluidised bed types ==
Bed types can be coarsely classified by their flow behavior, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Fluidisation technology |url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:p6X8M3WlO2YJ:www.outotec.com/36280.epibrw+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESh8iuKx7pBIfbDG7SAnJZ6O0IPTTDlXqjV4uDWfv4LuCwgIU71Dy8lNdFMdG29QREUpn80hMAhNybTn86_Me-LBOaOvoUdrZB45YyEoDxAKfnB3lpYaOVIQQFuRaNdyCckoRwRI&amp;sig=AHIEtbTtv04V2AHzno6Tj3TzVI-S2MzwJg | publisher = [[Outotec]] | date= May 2007 | accessdate= June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Stationary or bubbling fluidised bed is the classical approach where the gas at low velocities is used and fluidisation of the solids is relatively stationary, with some fine particles being entrained.
*[[Circulating fluidized bed]]s (CFB), where gases are at a higher velocity sufficient to suspend the particle bed, due to a larger kinetic energy of the fluid. As such the surface of the bed is less smooth and larger particles can be entrained from the bed than for stationary beds. Entrained particles are recirculated via an external loop back into the reactor bed.  Depending on the process, the particles may be classified by a cyclone separator and separated from or returned to the bed, based upon particle cut size.
*[[Vibratory fluidized bed]]s are similar to stationary beds, but add a mechanical vibration to further excite the particles for increased entrainment.
*[[Flash Reactor|Transport or flash reactor]] (FR).  At velocities higher than CFB, particles approach the velocity of the gas.  Slip velocity between gas and solid is significantly reduced at the cost of less homogeneous heat distribution.
*[[Annular fluidized bed]] (AFB).  A large nozzle at the center of a bubble bed introduces gas as high velocity achieving the rapid mixing zone above the surrounding bed comparable to that found in the external loop of a CFB.
* Mechanically Fluidised Reactor (MFR). A mechanical stirrer is used to mobilize particles and achieve properties similar to that a well-mixed fluidised bed. It does not require fluidisation gas.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhari, Mitesh C., "Effect of Liquid-Solid Contact on Thermal Cracking of Heavy Hydrocarbons in a Mechanically Fluidised Reactor" (2012). Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Repository. Paper 1009. http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/etd/1009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bed design==
[[Image:FluidisedBed.svg|thumb|200px|right|A diagram of a fluidised bed]]

=== Basic model ===
When the packed bed has a fluid passed over it, the pressure drop of the fluid is approximately proportional to the fluid's [[superficial velocity]]. In order to transition from a packed bed to a fluidised condition, the gas velocity is continually raised. For a free-standing bed there will exist a point, known as the minimum or incipient fluidisation point, whereby the bed's mass is suspended directly by the flow of the fluid stream. The corresponding fluid velocity, known as the "minimum
fluidisation velocity", &lt;math&gt;u_{mf}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=holdich&gt;{{citation| title= Fundamentals of Particle Technology | chapter = Chapter 7: Fluidisation | first1= Richard Graham |last1 = Holdich | isbn = 978-0954388102 | url = http://www.particles.org.uk/particle_technology_book/chapter_7.pdf |format = pdf | accessdate = June 2012 | publisher = Midland Information Technology &amp; Publishing |date = November 1, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the minimum fluidisation velocity (&lt;math&gt; u \geq u_{mf} &lt;/math&gt;), the bed material will be suspended by the gas-stream and further increases in the velocity will have a reduced effect on the pressure, owing to sufficient [[percolation]] of the gas flow. Thus the pressure drop for &lt;math&gt;u &gt; u_{mf}&lt;/math&gt; is relatively constant.

At the base of the vessel the apparent pressure drop multiplied by the cross-section area of the bed can be equated to the force of the weight of the solid particles (less the buoyancy of the solid in the fluid).
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Delta p_{w} = H_{w} (1- \epsilon_{w}) (\rho_{s} - \rho_{f}) g = [M_{s} g / A] [(\rho_{s} - \rho_{f}) / \rho_{s}] &lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;/center&gt;
where:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta p_{w} &lt;/math&gt; is the bed pressure drop

&lt;math&gt;H_{w}&lt;/math&gt; is the bed height

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{w}&lt;/math&gt; is the bed voidage, i.e. the fraction of the bed volume that is occupied by the voids (the fluid spaces between the particles)

&lt;math&gt;\rho_{s} &lt;/math&gt; is the apparent density of bed particles

&lt;math&gt;\rho_{f} &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the fluidising fluid

&lt;math&gt;g &lt;/math&gt; is the gravity acceleration

&lt;math&gt;M_{s} &lt;/math&gt; is the total mass of solids in the bed

&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the cross-sectional area of the bed

=== Geldart Groupings ===

In 1973, Professor D. Geldart proposed the grouping of powders in to four so-called "Geldart Groups".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0032-5910(73)80037-3|last1=Geldart|first1=D.|title=Types of gas fluidisation|journal=Powder technology|volume=7|issue=5|pages=285–292|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; The groups are defined by their locations on a diagram of solid-fluid density difference and particle size. Design methods for fluidised
beds can be tailored based upon the particle's Geldart grouping:&lt;ref name=holdich /&gt;

'''Group A''' For this group the particle size is between 20 and 100&amp;nbsp;µm, and the particle density is typically less than 1.4g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Prior to the initiation of a bubbling bed phase, beds from these particles will expand by a factor of 2 to 3 at incipient fluidisation, due to a decreased bulk density. Most powder-catalyzed beds utilize this group.

'''Group B''' The particle size lies between 40 and 500&amp;nbsp;µm and the particle density between 1.4-4g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Bubbling typically forms directly at incipient fluidisation.

'''Group C''' This group contains extremely fine and consequently the most cohesive particles. With a size of 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;µm, these particles fluidise under very difficult to achieve conditions, and may require the application of an external force, such as mechanical agitation.

'''Group D''' The particles in this region are above 600&amp;nbsp;µm and typically have high particle densities. Fluidisation of this group requires very high fluid energies and is typically associated with high levels of abrasion. Drying grains and peas, roasting coffee beans, gasifying coals, and some roasting metal ores are such solids, and they are usually processed in shallow beds or in the spouting mode.

=== Distributor ===
Typically, pressurized gas or liquid enters the fluidised bed vessel through numerous holes via a plate known as a distributor plate, located at the bottom of the fluidised bed. The fluid flows upward through the bed, causing the solid particles to be suspended. If the inlet fluid is disabled, the bed may settle, pack onto the plate or trickle down through the plate.
Many industrial beds use a sparger distributor instead of a distributor plate.  The fluid is then distributed through a series of perforated tubes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8486">'''Germ theory denialism''' is the belief that [[Microorganism|germs]] do not cause infectious disease, and that the [[germ theory of disease]] is wrong.{{R|"novella"}} It usually involves arguing that [[Louis Pasteur]]'s model of infectious disease was wrong, and that [[Antoine Béchamp]]'s was right. In fact, its origins are rooted in Béchamp's empirically disproved (in the context of disease) theory of [[pleomorphism (microbiology)|pleomorphism]]. {{R|"gorski"}} Another obsolete variation is known as [[terrain theory]] and postulates that diseased tissue attracts germs rather than being caused by it.{{R|"brock"}}

== About ==

Germ theory denialism (GTD) is as old as germ theory itself beginning with the rivalry of Pasteur and Béchamp. Pasteur's work in preventing beverage contamination led him to discover that it was due to [[microorganisms]] and led him down the path to be the first scientist to show the theory was valid and popularize it in Europe.{{R|"gorski"}} Although he was not the first to have the idea and scientists such as [[Girolamo Fracastoro]] (had the idea that [[fomites]] could harbor the seeds of contagion), [[Agostino Bassi]] (discovered the [[muscardine]] disease of silkworms was caused by a fungus that was named [[Beauveria bassiana]]), [[Friedrich Henle]] (developed the concepts of contagium vivum and contagium animatum), and others had earlier proposed ideas similar to germ theory.{{R|"contagion"}}{{R|"guthrie"}}

Béchamp strongly contested this view offering up a competing idea known as the pleomorphic theory of disease. This theory says that all life is based on forms that a certain class of organisms take during stages of their life-cycles and that germs are attracted to the environment of diseased tissue rather than being the cause of it.{{R|"bechamp"}} Proponents of this idea insist microbes that live in an organism go through the same stages of their development. According to [[Günther Enderlein]] they are as follows: [[Colloid]] — [[microbe]] (primitive phase), [[bacteria]] (middle phase), and [[fungus]] (end phase).{{R|"synth"}}

Earlier non-germ theories, in addition to the earlier idea of [[Miasma theory|miasma]], focused on [[spontaneous generation]] - the idea that living matter could arise from non-living - and the terrain theory variation of Béchamp's ideas. Pasteur disproved spontaneous generation with a series of experiments in the 1870s.{{R|"contagion"}} However, understanding the cause of a sickness does not always immediately lead to effective treatment of sickness and the great decline in mortality during the 19th century is mostly associated with improvement in hygiene and cleanliness. In fact, one of the first movements to deny the germ theory was the Sanitary Movement, and was nevertheless central in developing America's [[public health]] infrastructure. By providing clean water and sanitation there was less of an environment for [[pathogens]] to develop and [[mortality rates]] fell dramatically.{{R|"pizzi"}}

GTD has significant overlap with [[chiropractic]] practice. Many [[chiropractor]]s believe [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to be a function of spine alignment and the brain's ability to communicate efficiently with the body and that it has little to nothing to do with external [[pathogen]]s.{{R|"barrett"}}

A common thread among many alternative medicine proponents is [[Anti-vaccine movement|opposition to vaccines]] and many use GTD to justify their claims.{{R|"crislip"}} Germ theory deniers make many claims about the biological underpinnings of the theory and the historical record{{R|"fielder"}}{{R|"arizona"}} that are at odds with what is accepted by most modern scientists and historians.{{R|"novella"}}{{R|"gorski"}}{{R|"contagion"}}{{R|"hodkinson"}} Another popular claim from the anti-vaccine community is that all diseases are caused by [[Bacteremia|toxemia]] due to inadequate diet and health practices.{{R|"hall"}}

== Criticism ==

[[Harriet Hall]] published an article in ''[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]]'' where she describes her experience arguing with germ theory deniers.{{R|"hall"}}

Members of the medical community that are also skeptics, such as [[David Gorski]] and [[Steven Novella]], point out that denying germ theory is counter to years of experiments and the prevailing opinion of most doctors and scientists.{{R|"novella"}}{{R|"gorski"}}{{R|"orac"}}

The '''{{lang|de|Gesellschaft der Freunde alter Musikinstrumente}}''' ('''GEFAM''') (''Society of friends of old [[musical instruments]]'') was founded in 1951 in [[Zurich]], Switzerland, by a number of music lovers and collectors of historical musical instruments. It is still the only society in the German speaking part of Europe (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Lichtenstein) that is concerned mainly with old musical instruments. Thanks to its base in Switzerland it has a multicultural and multilanguage profile, visual in its international list of members. Today there are around 200 members (individuals and institutions), mainly in Europe, but also on other parts of the globe. The spectrum includes specialised museums and collections of old musical instruments, researchers and instrument makers as well as private collectors and enthusiasts.

The society is a forum in which public and private collections of musical instruments are visited and aspects of conservation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/musik-und-artenschutz-im-clinch-1.18435496&lt;/ref&gt; are discussed, whereby the history of the musical instruments is given special consideration. Occasionally extra-European instruments are regarded as well. In addition to these aspects the society also contributes to discussions between [[museum]] "[[Expert|specialists]]"&lt;!-- what is being quoted here? --&gt;{{cn|date=August 2015}}, [[Musical instrument|instrument makers]], [[universities]] and [[Music school|conservatories]] on the one hand and [[Private collection|private collectors]] and others interested in old musical instruments on the other.

==Publications==

The society publishes the biannual bulletin ''[[Glareana]]'' ([http://www.gefam.ch/en/glareana_en/ eJournal])&lt;ref&gt;Imogen Fellinger, et al. "Periodicals." Grove Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 12 Aug. 2015. &lt;http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/21338pg41&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with society news and articles on subjects pertaining to instruments. It has also published several [[monograph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gefam.ch/en/publications/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:260D.jpg|right|thumb|The Mercedes-Benz 260D.]]

Diesel engines began to be used in automobiles in the 1930s.  Mainly used for commercial applications early on, they did not gain popularity for passenger travel until their development in Europe in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/question399.htm If diesel engines are more efficient, why do most cars come with gasoline engines?]&lt;/ref&gt;  Diesel cars continue to develop into highly desired, high performance while retaining power and performance. In terms of pollution, diesel engines generally produce less carbon dioxide than gasoline-based engines but produce more nitrous oxides 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Have diesel cars been unfairly demonised for air pollution|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/11/have-diesel-cars-been-unfairly-demonised-for-air-pollution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 20th century==
[[Charles Chapman (engineer)|Charles Wallace Chapman]] at Perkins Engines at [[Peterborough]], England, developed an engine, the high speed diesel engine, for automobiles; previously diesel engines were too large and heavy.

Production '''diesel car history''' started in 1933&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citroen's Rosalie becomes the world's first commercially available diesel engined passenger car|url=http://www.nu-car.com/Diesel_Buyers_Guide/Diesel_Timeline.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The world's first mass-produced diesel car |url=http://www.oldengine.org/members/diesel/Misc/Ricardo.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uL1FQoM8?url=http://www.oldengine.org/members/diesel/Misc/Ricardo.htm |archivedate=2010-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Citroën]]'s [[Citroën 7U|Rosalie]], which featured a diesel engine option (the 1,766&amp;nbsp;cc 11UD engine) in the Familiale (estate or station wagon) model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cats-citroen.net/citroen/history.html#UA |title=Cats Citroën Net History |publisher=Cats-citroen.net |date=1934-05-03 |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mercedes-Benz 260 D|Mercedes-Benz 260D]] and the [[Hanomag]] Rekord were introduced in 1936.

Immediately after World War II, and throughout the 1950s and 1960s, diesel-powered cars began to gain limited popularity, particularly for commercial applications, such as ambulances, taxis, and station wagons used for delivery work.  Most were conventional in design.  Mercedes-Benz offered a continuous stream of diesel-powered taxis, beginning in 1949 with their 170D powered by the OM-636 engine. Later, in 1959 their OM-621 engine was introduced in the 180D. This 2.0&amp;nbsp;L engine produced {{convert|55|PS|kW|abbr=on}} at 4,350&amp;nbsp;rpm.  Beginning in 1959, Peugeot offered the 403D with their TMD-85 four-cylinder engine of 1.8&amp;nbsp;L and {{convert|48|PS|kW|abbr=on}}, followed in 1962 by the 404D with the same engine. In 1964, the 404D became available with the improved XD88 four-cylinder engine of 2.0&amp;nbsp;L and {{convert|60|PS|kW|abbr=on}}. Other cars available with diesel power during this era included the Austin A60 Cambridge, [[Isuzu Bellel]], Fiat 1400-A, Standard Vanguard, Borgward Hansa, and a few others.

In 1967, Peugeot introduced the world's first compact, high-speed diesel car, the Peugeot 204BD.  Its 1.3&amp;nbsp;L XL4D engine produces {{convert|46|PS|kW|abbr=on}} at 5,000&amp;nbsp;rpm. Following the 1970s oil crisis ([[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]]), Volkswagen introduced their first diesel, the [[VW Golf]], with a 1.5&amp;nbsp;L naturally aspirated indirect-injection engine which was a redesigned (dieselised) version of a gasoline engine. Mercedes-Benz tested turbodiesels in cars (e.g. by the [[Mercedes-Benz C111]] experimental and record-setting vehicles) and the first production [[turbo diesel]] cars were, in 1978, the 3.0 5-cylinder 115&amp;nbsp;hp (86&amp;nbsp;kW) [[Mercedes-Benz W116|Mercedes 300 SD]], available only in North America, and the [[Peugeot 604]].

The biggest single step forward for mass-market diesel cars came in 1982 when PSA Peugeot Citroën introduced the [[XUD]] engine in the [[Peugeot 305]], [[Peugeot 205]] and [[Talbot Horizon]]. This was the class leading automotive diesel engine until the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;"Diesel Car" (Future Publishing Limited, July edition, 1993), p.104&lt;/ref&gt; The first mass market turbo diesel was the XUD powered, 1988 [[Citroën BX]] and then the 1989 [[Peugeot 405]], they gave power and refinement approaching petrol engine standards,&lt;ref&gt;"Diesel Car" (Future Publishing Limited, August/September edition, 1998), p.19&lt;/ref&gt; with the best chassis in their class.  Diesel Car magazine said of the Citroën BX "We can think of no other car currently on sale in the UK that comes anywhere near approaching the BX Turbo's combination of performance, accommodation and economy".&lt;ref&gt;"Diesel Car" (Future Publishing Limited, August/September edition, 1998), p.22&lt;/ref&gt; These were the cars that started the diesel boom in Europe that has now hit 50% of the market in new car sales.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Diesels carried a 2.5% share of the European Community market in 1973. Following the fuel crisis, this share increased to 4.1% in 1975. This more than doubled (to 8.6%) by 1980, and by 1983 diesels represented 11% of new car sales in the [[European Union|EU]].&lt;ref name=Moniteur&gt;{{cite journal | ref = Moniteur | journal = Le Moniteur de l'Automobile | page = 20 | title = Citroën BX 19 TRD | last = Pirotte | first = Marcel | location = Brussels, Belgium | language = French | volume = 35 | number = 793 | date = 1984-04-19 | publisher = Editions Auto-Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diesel Powered Passenger Cars in North America have been steadily increasing in popularity, especially in the early-mid 2000s.  Diesels have typically only been used in trucks and commercial vehicles and buses.   Jeep had offered a Perkins Diesel option for its models in the early 1960s and Chrysler offered them as well although mainly for the European market though some have probably been retrofitted to older AMC and Chrysler models in the US, particularly as taxis.  Oldsmobile released a 350 cubic Inch (5.7 Litre) V8 diesel Engine starting in the late 1970s, most Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Chevrolet and even Cadillac divisions of General Motors, had received this engine by the 1980 model year, and continued to be sold until the engine was discontinued in 1985.  Whilst a very good idea at the time, owing to the recent 1979 energy crisis these engines had gained a terrible reputation for reliability.  Part of this had to do with the fact that, whilst the engine block itself was indeed a diesel specific design (contrary to most people's belief that it was simply a dieselised version of the famous rocket V8), GM management made significant cost saving measures by using many parts from the gas V8 counterpart which were not up to the task of diesel engine operation, specifically the number and type of head bolts used, and the lack of a water and fuel separator in the fuel line, a big issue as a lot of diesel fuel contained water and also high levels of sulfur at the time.  The engine was later revised into the DX block and most of the issues were fixed, a V6 version displacing 4.3 litres and a smaller 4.3 V8 were also offered around this time, mainly for the downsized front-wheel drive models of the mid-1980s and although they were much better in the reliability department, the damage had already been done and the North American diesel car market was severely crippled as a result, despite the best efforts by Mercedes-Benz, Audi, BMW, Peugeot, VW and others in offering their more refined and powerful diesel engines.  All of these olds designed units were non-turbocharged (or natural-aspirated) diesels.  This undoubtedly hampered them in the performance and efficiency departments, although there have been retrofits of turbochargers to Olds diesel blocks which are carried out by enthusiasts and collectors of these cars.  It isn't well proven if turbos are reliable long-term with these engines, but so far they seem to be suitable, however, what performance benefit they bring could be considered as dubious given how low their power output was to begin with.

==1990s and the present==
Diesels steadily gained in acceptance with private buyers in the 1970s and into the 1990s. Having originally been mainly marketed to commercial users such as taxi drivers, European diesel sales increased steadily and reached 17.3 per cent of the overall European market by 1992.&lt;ref name=NZCarp16&gt;{{cite journal | ref = NZC493 | journal = New Zealand Car | title = Newsline | page = 16 | volume = 7 | number = 6 | date = April 1993 | editor-last = Anderson | editor-first = Donn | location = Auckland, New Zealand | publisher = Accent Publishing Cnr | issn = 0113-0196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Audi]] enthusiasts claim that the [[Audi 100]] [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]] was the first turbo charged direct injection diesel sold in 1989, but actually it isn't true, as the [[Fiat Croma]] TD-i.d. was sold with turbo direct injection in 1987&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Technology Heritage|url=http://www.fiat.co.uk/innovations/air-technologies/fiat-technology-heritage/|accessdate=2012-03-16|work=fiat.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one year later [[Austin Rover]] [[Austin Montego|Montego]].&lt;ref name="austin-rover.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austin-rover.co.uk/index.htm?lm10storyf.htm|title=Maestro/Montego|accessdate=2008-04-08|work=austin-rover.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; What was pioneering about the Audi 100, however, was the use of electronic control of the engine, as the Fiat and Austin had Bosch mechanically controlled injection. In the writers experience the Audi 100&amp;nbsp;TDI was very troublesome and the engine code "AAT" is often known as the difficult Audi .{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The electronic control of direct injection really made a difference in terms of emissions, refinement and power. All earlier generation car direct injection diesel engines benefit greatly from the use of biodiesel fuel, which reduces emissions and greatly improves refinement without engine modifications, provided they use compatible 'Viton' type rubber in their fuel systems.

The diesel car markets are the same ones who pioneered various developments (Mercedes-Benz, [[BMW]], [[Peugeot]]/[[Citroën]], [[Fiat]], [[Alfa Romeo]], [[Volkswagen Group]]) There were also small diesel engines produced in England by British Leyland and Perkins.  For reasons of economy the petrol BMC "B" series engine was dieselised and produced in capacities of 1.5 and 1.8 litres.  Perkins produced the 4.99, 4.107 and 4.108 engines all of which were extremely reliable. Later BL produced the five main bearing "O" series engine which was extremely strong. Petrol turbo variants could make 200HP and the engine was ideal for converting to a diesel.  In fact, the 1988 Austin-Rover MDi unit (also known as the 'Perkins Prima') was developed by [[Perkins Engines]] of [[Peterborough]], who have designed and built high-speed diesels since the 1930s. It is still in production as a marine engine however in the writers opinion timing belts at sea are not a good idea. Engines that rely on timing belts are more suited to inland waterways. It is not easy to make a lightweight and powerful top class diesel engine owing to the immense pressures and heat produced within the engine. These problems were solved by VM Motori of Cento and the engines were apparently so good that Rover, Ford and Jeep bought them.  The interesting features of the engines were the tunnel-bore block and separate cylinder heads to allow for expansion. VM engines were marinised by BMW and sold as BMW stern-drive packages. Mercury Marine also used the VM engines. As they have aged in car applications, they have developed a reputation for blowing head gaskets, due to the separate cylinder head design.

In 1997, the first [[common rail]] diesel passenger car was introduced, the [[Alfa Romeo 156]].&lt;ref name="autonews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/files/07_ane_ptc/speakers.html|title=New Powertrain Technologies Conference|accessdate=2008-04-08|work=autonews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, for the very first time in the history of racing, in the legendary [[24 Hours Nürburgring]] race, a diesel-powered car was the overall winner: the BMW works team 320d, a [[BMW E36]] fitted with modern high-pressure diesel injection technology from [[Robert Bosch GmbH]]. The low fuel consumption and long range, allowing 4 hours of racing at once, made it a winner, as comparable petrol-powered cars spent more time refueling.

Chrysler put a [http://www.vmmotori.it/en/01/00/01/dettaglio.jsp?id=11 VM Motori SpA] engine in the [[Jeep Liberty#CRD in North America|Jeep Liberty]] sport utility vehicle in 2005 and 2006 to assess the American market's interest in modern high performance diesel engines.

In 2004 Honda released their first diesel engine, the N22A branded as the i-CTDI, it first featured in the Honda Accord.   The engine featured an aluminium block, DOHC chain driven valvetrain, common rail direct injection and variable geometry turbocharger.
 
In Spring 2005, Mercedes-Benz unveiled their first application of a mass-produced aluminum block diesel engine for passenger vehicles and commercial use. While aluminum is traditionally considered of inferior strength and temperature resistance to withstand diesel applications, Mercedes engineers made extensive use of CAD/CAM design to arrive at an aluminum block that would meet with Mercedes' testing and reliability standards. First use was in 2006 model-year vehicles in the E-Class sedan and ML-class and GL-class SUVs. Similar in weight ({{convert|208|kg|lb|abbr=on}}) to the five-cylinder it replaced, and considerably lighter than the in-line six-cylinder it also replaced, this 3.0L V-6 produces 165&amp;nbsp;kW (224&amp;nbsp;hp) at 3,800&amp;nbsp;rpm and max torque of 510 Nm (376&amp;nbsp;ft·lbf) at 1,600-2,800&amp;nbsp;rpm and makes use of a four-valve head. Additionally, fitment of Mercedes-Benz [[BlueTec]] system, a concert of emissions control strategies, renders this new diesel 50-state legal in the U.S. beginning in 2008 (stringent [[NOx]] limits have made U.S. passenger-car diesels unpopular or impossible in parts of the U.S. in recent years).

In 2006, the new [[Audi R10|Audi R10 TDI LMP1]] entered by [[Joest Racing]] became the first diesel-engined car to win the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. The winning car also bettered the post-1990 course configuration lap record by 1, at 380 laps. However, this fell short of the all-time distance record set in 1971 by over {{convert|200|km}}.

The [[Subaru]] car company of Japan is preparing to sell its [[station wagon]] version of their Legacy mid-size car (called the [[Subaru Outback]] in North America) with a 2.0-litre, [[boxer engine]] format opposed-four-cylinder diesel engine of {{convert|110|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} power, and {{convert|350|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}} of torque, in the [[United Kingdom]]. Sales in continental Europe started in 2008.

Since the numerous [[Diesel emissions scandal]]s of recent years the most high profile of which was the [[Volkswagen emissions scandal]] of 2015 it has been revealed that the levels of toxic emissions coming from diesel cars are higher and pose a greater risk to human health than those of vehicles powered by other means.
&lt;ref&gt;http://theconversation.com/fact-check-are-diesel-cars-really-more-polluting-than-petrol-cars-76241&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diesel engine vehicle racing ==
Although the weight and lower output of a diesel engine tend to keep them away from automotive racing applications, there are many diesels being raced in classes that call for them, mainly in [[truck]] racing and [[tractor pulling]], as well in types of racing where these drawbacks are less severe, such as [[land speed record]] racing or [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance racing]]. Even diesel-engined dragsters exist, despite the diesel's drawbacks of weight and low peak rpm, specifications central to performance in this sport. However, in 2006, the new [[Audi R10 TDI]] LMP1 entered by Joest Racing became the first diesel-engined car to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.dieselworldmag.com/content/view/62/ | title = World's First 7-Second Diesel Dragster | journal = Diesel World Magazine |date=January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historic ===
As early as 1931, [[Clessie Cummins]] installed his diesel in the Cummins "Diesel Special" race car, hitting {{convert|162|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} at Daytona and {{convert|138|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} at the [[Indianapolis 500]] race,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.dieselduck.ca/library/other/prime_movers.htm |title = The Diesel engine and its development, A historical timeline |author = Martin Leduc}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[David Evans (automobile racer)|Dave Evans]] became the first driver to complete the [[Indianapolis 500]] without making a single [[pit stop]], completing the full distance on the lead lap and finishing 13th, relying on torque and fuel efficiency to overcome weight and low peak power.&lt;ref name = "roadking"&gt;{{cite web |title = Track Star, The diesel-powered Audi R10 owns every race it enters |author = Paul Abelson |publisher = Road King Magazine |url = http://www.roadking.com/story.php?id=800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, a 1925 [[Bentley]] with a [[L Gardner and Sons Ltd|Gardner]] 4LW engine was the first diesel-engine car to take part in the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] when it was driven by Lord Howard de Clifford. It was the leading British car and finished fifth overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Firsts in sport |url = http://web.ukonline.co.uk/m.gratton/Sport.htm |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202195321/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/m.gratton/Sport.htm |archivedate = 2008-12-02 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Cummins Diesel Roadster.jpg|thumb|A 1950 "Cummins Diesel Special" [[Indianapolis 500]] roadster.]]
In 1952, [[Fred Agabashian]] in a Cummins diesel won the pole at the Indianapolis 500 race with a turbocharged 6.6-liter diesel car,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Cummins History |publisher = [[Cummins]] |url = http://www.cummins.com/eu/pages/en/whoweare/cumminshistory.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; setting a record for pole position lap speed, {{convert|222.108|km/h|mi/h|3|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name = "roadking"/&gt; [[Don Cummins]] and his chief engineer [[Neve Reiners]] recognized that the low [[center of gravity]] of the [[flat engine]] configuration (designed to lie beneath the floor of a [[bus]]) plus the power advantage gained by the novel use of [[Elliott Motor|Elliott]] [[turbocharger|turbocharging]] would be a winning combination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Snowberger's Done It Again&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; 1952 Cummins Diesel Car |publisher = National Indy 500 Collector Club |author = Greg Littleton |url = http://www.ni500cc.com/chutes/win05d.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start, a slow pace lap (reportedly less than {{convert|150|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}) apparently induced what is now referred to as "[[turbo lag]]" and badly hampered the throttle response of the Cummins Diesel.  Although Agabashian found himself in eighth place before reaching the first turn, he moved up to fifth in a few laps and was running competitively (albeit well back in the field after a tire change) until the badly situated air intake of the car swallowed enough debris from the track to disable the turbocharger at lap 71; he finished 27th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Viva la diesel! |author = Gavin Foster |date=  2006-07-27 |publisher = [[Mail &amp; Guardian]] Online |url = http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=278954&amp;area=/wheels_deals/new_reviews/}} (incorrect reference to the Cummins Diesel leading laps in the race)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s and rule makers supported the concept, [[BMW]] and [[Volkswagen]] raced diesel [[touring car racing|touring cars]], with BMW winning the 1998 [[24 Hours Nürburgring]] with a [[BMW E36|320d]] against other factory-entered diesel competition of VW and about 200 normally powered cars, mainly by being able to drive very long stints. [[Alfa Romeo]] even organized a racing series with their [[Alfa Romeo 147]] 1.9 JTD models.

In 2006, a BMW 120d repeated a similar result, scoring 5th in a field of 220 cars, many of them much more powerful, a significantly stronger competition than in 1998. The VW [[Dakar Rally]] race [[Volkswagen Touareg|Touareg]] for 2005 and 2006 are powered by their own line of TDI engines in order to challenge for the first overall diesel win there.

[[Image:R10 Engine.jpg|thumb|The diesel engine of [[Audi]]'s [[2007 24 Hours of Le Mans]]-winning [[Audi R10 TDI|R10 TDI]].]]

Meanwhile, the five time [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] winner [[Audi R8 (race car)|Audi R8]] race car was replaced by the [[Audi R10 TDI]] in 2006, which is powered by a {{convert|650|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1100|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}}  V12 TDI [[common rail]] diesel engine, mated to a 5-speed gearbox, instead of the 6 used in the R8, to handle the extra torque produced. The gearbox is considered the main problem, as earlier attempts by others failed due to the lack of suitable transmissions that could stand the torque long enough.

After winning the [[12 Hours of Sebring]] in 2006 with their diesel-powered [[Audi R20 TDI|R10 TDI]], [[Audi]] obtained the overall win at the 2006 [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], too. This is the first time a sports car could compete for overall victories with diesel fuel against cars powered with regular fuel or [[methanol]] and [[bio-ethanol]]. However, the significance of this is slightly lessened by the fact that the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest|ACO]]/[[ALMS]] race rules encourage the use of alternative fuels such as diesel.

Audi again triumphed at Sebring in 2007. It had both a speed and fuel economy advantage over the entire field including the [[Porsche RS Spyder]]s, gasoline powered purpose-built race cars. Audi's diesels won again the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans, against competition coming from the [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP]] diesel powered racer.

In 2006, the [[JCB Dieselmax]] broke the diesel land speed record posting an average speed of over {{convert|328|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.  The vehicle used "two diesel engines that have a combined total of 1,500 horsepower (1120 kilowatts). Each is a 4-cylinder, 4.4-liter engine used commercially in a backhoe loader." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = New diesel land speed record: {{convert|328|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} |author = Associated Press |publisher = MSNBC |url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14486354/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = JCB car beats diesel speed record |date=  2006-08-22 |publisher = BBC |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/5273540.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 [[British Touring Car Championship|BTCC]], Jason Plato and Darren Turner are racing factory sponsored SEAT Leon TDI with some success against a variety of gasoline powered competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seatsportuk.co.uk/sport/ |title=SEAT Sport UK |publisher=SEAT Sport UK |date= |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungarian Space Camp ===
====History====
The camp was founded by Aunt Magdi, the "Space Granny" in 1994. Her intent was to introduce space research and astronautics to the youth. That time the program of the camp consisted mostly of lectures presented by the best-known Hungarian scientists in the field. Later the camp had a younger leadership, leading to a shift to more active and creative programs. From 2010 the duration of the camp is one week, from Sunday to Saturday. 
The participants are students between the age of 13 and 18, all interested in sciences and space topics. About quarter of the students return next year and every fifth student becomes a regular camper. Some acknowledged space researchers started their "space career" in the Space Camp, like the present (2017) Secretary General and several Members of Board.

====Locations====
1994 - Kecskemét, 1995 - Eger, 1996 - Veszprém, 1997 - Veszprém, 1998 - Győr, 1999 - Kecskemét, 2000 - Sopron, 2001 - Debrecen, 2002 - Székesfehérvár, 2003 - Budapest, 2004 - Kiskunhalas, 2005 - Gyulaháza, 2006 - Szentlélek, 2007 - Hollóstető, 2008 - Szentlélek, 2010 - Gyomaendrőd, 2011 - Sátoraljaújhely, 2012 - Kecskemét, 2013 - Alsómocsolád, 2014 - Felsőtárkány, 2015 - Sopron, 2016 - Debrecen, 2017 - Bakonybél

====Lectures and Activities====
In the camp space researchers and astronautical experts give '''lectures'''. Topics cover a wide range, from the basics of astronomy through problems of space debris to deciding the dilemma if Pluto is a planet or not. Other '''activities''' include several practical exercises make the camp exciting, e.g. water rocketry, underwater assembly, creating stereo pictures, astronomical observation, excursions, bathing, etc.  There is a main topic every year which meets the topic of the Student Competition.

====Mentor Program====
Since 2015 private individuals and companies are invited to co-finance the ''Hungarian Space Camp'' as '''Mentors'''. HAS welcomes financial support of participation of needy students from Hungary and from the Hungarian diaspora in the surrounding countries. In the past years about one fifth of the participants was able to join the Camp by favor of a Mentor.

===Student competition===
HAS yearly announces a '''Student Competition''' for primary and secondary school students, since 1992. The topics announced around October are always different, but focus on a current aspect of space research and exploration. The topic of the Student Competition is going to be the main topic of the Space Camp of that year. E.g. title of the Competition was "Civilians in Space" in 2014, "Beyond Mars" in 2015 and "Cleaning in Space" in 2017.&lt;br /&gt;
Categories: writing essay; drawing; preparing project plan; creating video, website, Facebook page or blog. &lt;br /&gt;
Small teams of two or three students are also welcome. Applications are evaluated in two age classes: age between 11-14 and 15-18. The competition is open for visually impaired students as well. Their works are evaluated separately.&lt;br /&gt;
Prizes include participation in the Space Camp for free or for a reduced fee; science books and magazines; a visit to a selected space research institute or company; free one-year membership in the society.

===Space Academy ===
''Hungarian Astronautical Society'' in collaboration with the international ''[[Space Generation Advisory Council]]'' initiated a yearly event called '''Space Academy'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://urakademia.hu Space Academy]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015 for university students and young professionals of the age between 18-35. .&lt;ref&gt;http://spacegeneration.org/sgac-regions/europe/hungary.html  SGAC Hungary&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a four-day workshop in August where the participants outline a solution for a given task or problem together.

* 2016: Design Experiment to the International Space Station!

===Space Academy Club===
'''Space Academy Club''' is a lecture series organized by the '''Hungarian Astronautical Society''' and the Hungarian organizers of '''Space Generation Advisory Council'''. It takes place usually in February, April, September and November, during university semesters. It targets primarily university students and young professionals of the age between 18-35. The series is connected with Space Academy in their name and their target groups.

===Hungarian Space Studies Annuary (alias Space Brochure, Hun: Űrtan évkönyv)===
HAS has been publishing its Astronautical Brochure since 1961, presenting the recent activities of HAS and summarizing the globally most significant affairs of space research. Hungarian researchers working in space research and its interdisciplinary fields present their latest results.

===Space Research Day===
Space Research Day is organized yearly. It joins the International Space Week in October. It usually takes place at one of the universities of Budapest. The program consists of lectures on actual space activities and space related results and exchange of views. There are blocks for professionals, interested amateurs and students.

===Hungarian Space Research Forum (Ionosphere and Magnetosphere Physics Seminar) ===
'''Hungarian Space Research Forum''' is a traditional biennial conference of researchers of the field, to be held for the 30th time in 2017. Its former title and now subtitle '''Ionosphere and Magnetosphere Physical Seminar''' expresses its original specialty which gained a broader horizon in the past decades.&lt;ref&gt;http://fenyi.solarobs.csfk.mta.hu/scostep/scostep_eng.html  Hungarian National Committee of SCOSTEP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fenyi.solarobs.csfk.mta.hu/ionmagnszem/ionmagnszem.html  List of Ionospheric-Magnetopheric Seminars from 1972-2004&lt;/ref&gt;
Hungarian physicists, geophysicists, astronomers, meteorologists etc. take part in this seminar by presenting their latest researches through lectures and posters.

===School Day===
HAS is willing to provide lectures for schools in various fields related to space activities titled '''School Day'''. Every year our members give several lectures in Budapest and around the country in (mainly secondary) schools on fresh and exciting scientific topics like the last results on Mars exploration, development of equipments for spacecraft, planetary discoveries, etc.

===Radio Connection between Students and Charles Simonyi on board of ISS [2007]===
'''[[Charles Simonyi|Dr. Charles Simonyi]]''', the first repeat ''[[Space Tourists|space tourist]]'' launched on April 7, 2007 (GMT), on board Soyuz TMA-10 to the International Space Station and returned on April 21, 2007 on his first space flight. The Hungarian-born Simonyi is a licensed amateur radio operator (KE7KDP) and he contacted students of Puskás Tivadar Távközlési Technikum (Puskás Tivadar Telecommunications Polytechnic, Budapest) on April 13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.termeszetvilaga.hu/radiokapcsolat_text.html#kozlemeny_apr14_1200 Simonyi, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; This occasion of radio contact was organized in collaboration with HAS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10772">{{About|the scientific names of plants and fungi|the equivalent naming of animals|Trinomen|the names of cultivated plants|International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants}}

In [[botany]], an '''infraspecific name''' is the [[scientific name]] for any [[taxon]] below the [[rank (taxonomy)|rank]] of [[species (biology)|species]], i.e. an '''infraspecific taxon'''. (A "taxon", plural "taxa", is a group of organisms to be given a particular name.) The scientific names of botanical taxa are regulated by the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (ICN).&lt;ref name=icb&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This specifies a 'three part name' for infraspecific taxa, plus a 'connecting term' to indicate the rank of the name.&lt;ref name=icb24&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 24&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a name is ''Astrophytum myriostigma'' subvar. ''glabrum'', the name of a subvariety of the species ''[[Astrophytum myriostigma]]'' (bishop's hat cactus).

Names below the rank of species of cultivated kinds of plants and of animals are regulated by different codes of nomenclature and are formed somewhat differently.

==Construction of infraspecific names==

Article 24 of the ICN describes how infraspecific names are constructed.&lt;ref name="icb24"/&gt; The order of the three parts of an infraspecific name is:
:genus name, specific epithet, connecting term indicating the rank (not part of the name, but required), infraspecific epithet.
It is customary to italicize all three parts of such a name, but not the connecting term.&lt;ref&gt;See the examples in {{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 24&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
* ''Acanthocalycium klimpelianum'' var. ''macranthum''
:genus name = ''Acanthocalycium'', specific epithet = ''klimpelianum'', connecting term = var. (short for "varietas" or [[variety (botany)|variety]]), infraspecific epithet = ''macranthum''

*''Astrophytum myriostigma'' subvar. ''glabrum''
:genus name = ''Astrophytum'', specific epithet = ''myriostigma'', connecting term = subvar. (short for "subvarietas" or subvariety), infraspecific epithet = ''glabrum''

The recommended abbreviations for ranks below species are, for example:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 4; abbreviations from Recommendation 5A&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[subspecies]] - recommended abbreviation: subsp. (but "ssp." is also in use although not recognised by Art 26)
* varietas ([[variety (botany)|variety]]) - recommended abbreviation: var.
* subvarietas ([[subvariety]]) -  recommended abbreviation: subvar.
* forma ([[form (botany)|form]]) -  recommended abbreviation: f.
* subforma (subform) -  recommended abbreviation: subf.

== Abbreviation of infraspecific names ==

Like specific epithets, infraspecific epithets cannot be used in isolation as names.&lt;ref name=icbn241&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 24.1&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the name of a particular species of ''Acanthocalycium'' is ''Acanthocalycium klimpelianum'', which can be abbreviated to ''A. klimpelianum'' where the context makes the genus clear. The species cannot be referred to as just ''klimpelianum''. In the same way, the name of a particular variety of ''Acanthocalycium klimpelianum'' is ''Acanthocalycium klimpelianum'' var. ''macranthum'', which can be abbreviated to ''A. k.'' var. ''macranthum'' where the context makes the species clear. The variety cannot be referred to as just ''macranthum''.

Sometimes more than three parts will be given; strictly speaking, this is not a name, but a [[Scientific classification|classification]]. The ICN gives the example of ''Saxifraga aizoon'' var. ''aizoon'' subvar. ''brevifolia'' f. ''multicaulis'' subf. ''surculosa''; the name of the subform would be ''Saxifraga aizoon'' subf. ''surculosa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 24.1, Ex. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legitimate infraspecific names==

For a proposed infraspecific name to be legitimate it must be in accordance with all the rules of the ICN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Appendix VII Glossary of terms used and defined in this Code, entry for "legitimate"&lt;/ref&gt; Only some of the main points are described here.

A key concept in botanical names is that of a [[type (biology)|type]]. In many cases the type will be a particular preserved specimen stored in a [[herbarium]], although there are other kinds of type. Like other names, an infraspecific name is attached to a type. Whether a plant should be given a particular infraspecific name can then be decided by comparing it to the type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no requirement for a species to be divided into infraspecific taxa, of whatever rank; in other words, a species does not have to have subspecies, varieties, forms, etc. However, if infraspecific ranks are created, then the name of the type of the species must repeat the specific epithet as its infraspecific epithet. The type acquires this name automatically as soon as any infraspecific rank is created.&lt;ref name=icbn26&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 26&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, consider ''[[Poa secunda]]'' &lt;small&gt;J.Presl&lt;/small&gt;, whose type specimen is in the Wisconsin State Herbarium.&lt;ref name=wsh&gt;{{Citation |title=Wisconsin Botanical Information System: Type Specimens |publisher=Wisconsin State Herbarium, University of Wisconsin |url=http://www.botany.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/searchspecimen.cgi?typeSpecimen=1 |accessdate=2011-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As soon as a subspecies of ''Poa secunda''  was created, then the type specimen of ''P. secunda''  immediately became the type specimen of ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''secunda''. The name "''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''secunda''" was automatically created (it is an "autonym"). Soreng created the subspecies ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''juncifolia'' (whose type specimen is also in the Wisconsin State Herbarium),&lt;ref name=wsh/&gt; thereby making the type specimen of ''P. secunda'' also the type specimen of ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''secunda''.
* If in addition to the subspecies any variety of ''Poa secunda'' were to be created, then the type specimen of ''P. secunda''  would automatically become the type specimen of ''Poa secunda'' var. ''secunda''. The type specimen would then have the classification ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''secunda'' var. ''secunda''.

The same epithet can be used again within a species, at whatever level, only if the names with the re-used epithet are attached to the same type.&lt;ref name=icbn26/&gt; Thus there can be a form called ''Poa secunda'' f. ''juncifolia'' as well as the subspecies ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''juncifolia'' if, and only if, the type specimen of ''Poa secunda'' f. ''juncifolia'' is the same as the type specimen of ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''juncifolia'' (in other words, if there is a single type specimen whose classification is ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''juncifolia'' f. ''juncifolia'').

If two infraspecific taxa which have different types are accidentally given the same epithet, then a [[Homonym (biology)|homonym]] has been created. The earliest published name is the legitimate one and the other must be changed.&lt;ref name=icbn53&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 53.4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifying authors==
When indicating authors for infraspecific names, it is possible to show either just the author(s) of the final, infraspecific epithet, or the authors of both the specific and the infraspecific epithets.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Examples:

*''Adenia aculeata'' subsp. ''inermis'' de Wilde
:This identifies de Wilde as the author who published this name for the subspecies (i.e. who created the epithet ''inermis''). Note that here it was decided not to indicate authority for the species.
*''Pinus nigra'' J.F.Arnold subsp. ''salzmannii'' (Dunal) Franco
:Here, J.F.Arnold is the author who gave the species, [[European black pine]], its botanical name ''Pinus nigra''; Dunal is the author who was the first to publish the epithet ''salzmanii'' for this taxon (as the species ''Pinus salzmanii''); Franco is the author who reduced the taxon to a subspecies of ''Pinus nigra''.

==Difference from zoological nomenclature==
In [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|zoological nomenclature]], names of taxa below species rank are formed somewhat differently, using a [[trinomen]] or 'trinomial name'. No connecting term is required as there is only one rank below species, the [[subspecies]].

==Cultivated plants==
The ''ICN'' does not regulate the names of cultivated plants, of [[cultivar]]s, i.e. plants specifically created for use in agriculture or horticulture. Such names are regulated by the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]]'' (ICNCP).

Although logically below the rank of species (and hence "infraspecific"), a [[cultivar]] name may be attached to any scientific name at the genus level or below. The minimum requirement is to specify a genus name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brickell, C.D.; Alexander, C.; David, J.C.; Hetterscheid, W.L.A.; Leslie, A.C.; Malecot, V.; Jin, X.; Editorial committee; Cubey, J.J. |year=2009  |title=International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP or Cultivated Plant Code) incorporating the Rules and Recommendations for naming plants in cultivation, Eighth Edition, Adopted by the International Union of Biological Sciences International Commission for the Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants |publisher=International Association for Plant Taxonomy and International Society for Horticultural  Science   |url=http://www.actahort.org/chronica/pdf/sh_10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''Achillea'' 'Cerise Queen' is a cultivar; ''Pinus nigra'' 'Arnold Sentinel' is a cultivar of the species ''P.&amp;nbsp;nigra'' (which is propagated vegetatively, by [[cloning]]).

'''Integrated circuit design''', or '''IC design''', is a subset of [[electronics engineering]], encompassing the particular [[Boolean logic|logic]] and [[circuit design]] techniques required to design [[integrated circuits]], or ICs.  ICs consist of miniaturized [[electronic component]]s built into an [[electrical network]] on a monolithic [[semiconductor]] substrate by [[photolithography]].

IC design can be divided into the broad categories of [[Digital data|digital]] and [[analog electronics|analog]] IC design. Digital IC design is to produce components such as [[microprocessors]], [[FPGA]]s, memories ([[Random-access memory|RAM]], [[Read-only memory|ROM]], and [[flash memory|flash]]) and digital [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]s. Digital design focuses on logical correctness, maximizing circuit density, and placing circuits so that clock and timing signals are routed efficiently. Analog IC design also has specializations in power IC design and [[Radio frequency|RF]] IC design. Analog IC design is used in the design of [[op-amp]]s, [[linear regulator]]s, [[phase locked loop]]s, [[oscillator]]s and [[active filter]]s. Analog design is more concerned with the physics of the semiconductor devices such as gain, matching, power dissipation, and resistance. Fidelity of analog signal amplification and filtering is usually critical and as a result, analog ICs use larger area active devices than digital designs and are usually less dense in circuitry.

Modern ICs are enormously complicated. An average desktop computer chip, as of 2015, has over 1 billion transistors. The [[Design rules|rules]] for what can and cannot be manufactured are also extremely complex. Common IC processes of 2015 have more than 500 rules. Furthermore, since the manufacturing process itself is not completely predictable, designers must account for its [[Statistics|statistical]] nature. The complexity of modern IC design, as well as market pressure to produce designs rapidly, has led to the extensive use of [[Electronic design automation|automated design tools]] in the IC design process.  In short, the design of an IC using [[Electronic design automation|EDA software]] is the design, test, and verification of the instructions that the IC is to carry out.

== Fundamentals ==

Integrated circuit design involves the creation of electronic components, such as [[transistors]], [[resistors]], [[capacitors]] and the metallic [[interconnect]] of these components onto a piece of semiconductor, typically [[silicon]]. A method to isolate the individual components formed in the [[Wafer (electronics)|substrate]] is necessary since the substrate silicon is conductive and often forms an active region of the individual components. The two common methods are [[p-n junction isolation]] and [[dielectric isolation]].  Attention must be given to power dissipation of transistors and interconnect resistances and current density of the [[interconnect]], [[Via (electronics)|contacts and vias]] since ICs contain very tiny devices compared to discrete components, where such concerns are less of an issue. [[Electromigration]] in metallic interconnect and [[Electrostatic discharge|ESD]] damage to the tiny components are also of concern. Finally, the physical layout of certain circuit subblocks is typically critical, in order to achieve the desired speed of operation, to segregate noisy portions of an IC from quiet portions, to balance the effects of heat generation across the IC, or to facilitate the [[Placement (EDA)|placement]] of connections to circuitry outside the IC.

## Ramp up
## Production
## Yield Analysis / Warranty Analysis [[Reliability (semiconductor)]]
##[[Failure analysis]] on any returns
## Plan for next generation chip using production information if possible

Roughly saying, digital IC design can be divided into three parts.
*[[Electronic system-level]] design: This step creates the user functional specification. The user may use a variety of languages and tools to create this description. Examples include a [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]] model, [[SystemC]], [[SystemVerilog]] [[Transaction-level modeling|Transaction Level Models]], [[Simulink]] and [[MATLAB]].
*RTL design: This step converts the user specification (what the user wants the chip to do) into a [[register transfer level]] (RTL) description.  The RTL describes the exact behavior of the digital circuits on the chip, as well as the interconnections to inputs and outputs.
*Physical design:  This step takes the RTL, and a library of available logic gates, and creates a chip design.  This involves figuring out which gates to use, defining places for them, and wiring them together.

Note that the second step, RTL design, is responsible for the chip doing the right thing. The third step, physical design, does not affect the functionality at all (if done correctly) but determines how fast the chip operates and how much it costs.

==Design lifecycle==
The [[integrated circuit]] (IC) development process starts with defining product requirements, progresses through architectural definition, implementation, bringup and finally productization. The various phases of the integrated circuit development process are described below. Although the phases are presented here in a straightforward fashion, in reality there is [[iteration]] and these steps may occur multiple times.

===Requirements===
Before an [[architecture]] can be defined some high level product goals must be defined. The [[requirement]]s are usually generated by a cross functional team that addresses [[market opportunity]], customer needs, [[wiktionary:feasibility|feasibility]] and much more. This phase should result in a [[product requirements document]].

===Architecture===
The ''[[architecture]]'' defines the fundamental structure, goals and principles of the product. It defines high level concepts and the intrinsic value proposition of the product. Architecture teams take into account many variables and interface with many groups. People creating the architecture generally have a significant amount of experience dealing with systems in the area for which the architecture is being created. The work product of the architecture phase is an architectural [[specification]].

===Micro-architecture===
The micro-architecture is a step closer to the hardware. It implements the architecture and defines specific mechanisms and structures for achieving that implementation. The result of the micro-architecture phase is a micro-architecture specification which describes the methods used to implement the architecture.

===Implementation===
In the implementation phase the design itself is created using the micro-architectural specification as the starting point. This involves low level [[definition]] and partitioning, writing [[code]], entering schematics and verification. This phase ends with a [[design]] reaching [[tape-out|tapeout]].

===Bringup===
After a design is created, taped-out and manufactured, actual hardware, 'first silicon', is received  which is taken into the lab where it goes through ''bringup''. Bringup is the process of powering, testing and characterizing the design in the lab. Numerous [[Quality control|tests]] are performed starting from very simple tests such as ensuring that the device will power on to much more complicated tests which try to stress the part in various ways. The result of the bringup phase is documentation of [[characterization data]] (how well the part performs to spec) and errata (unexpected behavior).

===Productization===
Productization is the task of taking a design from engineering into mass production manufacturing. Although a design may have successfully met the specifications of the product in the lab during the bringup phase there are many challenges that face product engineers when trying to mass-produce those designs. The [[integrated circuit|IC]] must be ramped up to production volumes with an acceptable yield. The goal of the productization phase is to reach mass production volumes at an acceptable cost.

===Sustaining===
Once a design is mature and has reached mass production it must be sustained. The process must be continually monitored and problems dealt with quickly to avoid a significant impact on production volumes. The goal of sustaining is to maintain production volumes and continually reduce costs until the product reaches [[end-of-life (product)|end of life]].

== Design process ==

=== Microarchitecture and system-level design ===
The initial chip design process begins with system-level design and microarchitecture planning. Within IC design companies, management and often analytics will draft a proposal for a design team to start the design of a new chip to fit into an industry segment. Upper-level designers will meet at this stage to decide how the chip will operate functionally. This step is where an IC's functionality and design are decided. IC designers will map out the functional requirements, verification testbenches, and testing methodologies for the whole project, and will then turn the preliminary design into a system-level specification that can be simulated with simple models using languages like C++ and MATLAB and emulation tools. For pure and new designs, the system design stage is where an [[Instruction set]] and operation is planned out, and in most chips existing instruction sets are modified for newer functionality. Design at this stage is often statements such as ''encodes in the [[MP3]] format'' or ''implements [[IEEE floating-point arithmetic]]''. At later stages in the design process, each of these innocent looking statements expands to hundreds of pages of textual documentation.

=== RTL design ===
Upon agreement of a system design, RTL designers then implement the functional models in a hardware description language like [[Verilog]], [[SystemVerilog]], or [[VHDL]]. Using digital design components like adders, shifters, and state machines as well as computer architecture concepts like pipelining, superscalar execution, and [[branch prediction]], RTL designers will break a functional description into hardware models of components on the chip working together. Each of the simple statements described in the system design can easily turn into thousands of lines of [[Register-transfer level|RTL]] code, which is why it is extremely difficult to verify that the RTL will do the right thing in all the possible cases that the user may throw at it.

To reduce the number of functionality bugs, a separate hardware verification group will take the RTL and design testbenches and systems to check that the RTL actually is performing the same steps under many different conditions, classified as the domain of [[functional verification]]. Many techniques are used, none of them perfect but all of them useful &amp;ndash; extensive [[logic simulation]], [[formal methods]], [[hardware emulation]], [[Lint programming tool|lint]]-like code checking, [[code coverage]], and so on.

A tiny error here can make the whole chip useless, or worse.  The famous [[Pentium FDIV bug]] caused the results of a division to be wrong by at most 61 parts per million, in cases that occurred very infrequently.  No one even noticed it until the chip had been in production for months.  Yet [[Intel]] was forced to offer to replace, for free, every chip sold until they could fix the bug, at a cost of $475 million (US).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Physical design ===
[[File:FlowPhysicalDesign.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Physical design steps within the digital design flow]]

RTL is only a behavioral model of the actual functionality of what the chip is supposed to operate under. It has no link to a physical aspect of how the chip would operate in real life at the materials, physics, and electrical engineering side. For this reason, the next step in the IC design process, [[Physical design (electronics)|physical design]] stage, is to map the RTL into actual geometric representations of all electronics devices, such as capacitors, resistors, logic gates, and transistors that will go on the chip.

The main steps of physical design are listed below. In practice there is not a straightforward progression - considerable iteration is required to ensure all objectives are met simultaneously.  This is a difficult problem in its own right, called [[design closure]].

*[[Logic synthesis]]:  The RTL is mapped into a gate-level netlist in the target technology of the chip.
*[[Floorplan (microelectronics)|Floorplanning]]: The RTL of the chip is assigned to gross regions of the chip, input/output (I/O) pins are assigned and large objects (arrays, cores, etc.) are placed.
*[[Placement (EDA)|Placement]]:  The gates in the netlist are assigned to nonoverlapping locations on the die area.
*Logic/placement refinement: Iterative logical and placement transformations to close performance and power constraints.
*[[Clock Distribution Networks|Clock insertion]]: Clock signal wiring is (commonly, [[clock tree]]s)  introduced into the design.
*[[Routing (EDA)|Routing]]: The wires that connect the gates in the netlist are added.
*Postwiring optimization:  Performance ([[timing closure]]), noise ([[signal integrity]]), and yield ([[Design for manufacturability (IC)|Design for manufacturability]]) violations are removed.
*[[Design for manufacturability (IC)|Design for manufacturability]]:  The design is modified, where possible, to make it as easy and efficient as possible to produce. This is achieved by adding extra vias or adding dummy metal/diffusion/poly layers wherever possible while complying to the design rules set by the foundry.
*Final checking: Since errors are expensive, time consuming and hard to spot, extensive error checking is the rule, [[Formal equivalence checking|making sure the mapping to logic was done correctly]], and [[Design rule checking|checking that the manufacturing rules were followed faithfully]].
*[[Tape-out|Tapeout]] and mask generation: the design data is turned into [[photomask]]s in [[mask data preparation]].

== Analog design ==
Before the advent of the microprocessor and software based design tools, analog ICs were designed using hand calculations and process kit parts. These ICs were low complexity circuits, for example, [[op-amp]]s, usually involving no more than ten transistors and few connections. An iterative trial-and-error process and "overengineering" of device size was often necessary to achieve a manufacturable IC. Reuse of proven designs allowed progressively more complicated ICs to be built upon prior knowledge. When inexpensive computer processing became available in the 1970s, computer programs were written to simulate circuit designs with greater accuracy than practical by hand calculation. The first circuit simulator for analog ICs was called [[SPICE]] (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuits Emphasis). Computerized circuit simulation tools enable greater IC design complexity than hand calculations can achieve, making the design of analog [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]s practical. The computerized circuit simulators also enable mistakes to be found early in the design cycle before a physical device is [[Semiconductor fabrication|fabricated]]. Additionally, a computerized circuit simulator can implement more sophisticated device models and circuit analysis too tedious for hand calculations, permitting [[Monte Carlo analysis]] and process sensitivity analysis to be practical. The effects of parameters such as temperature variation, doping concentration variation and statistical process variations can be simulated easily to determine if an IC [[Design for manufacturability (IC)|design is manufacturable]]. Overall, computerized circuit simulation enables a higher degree of confidence that the circuit will work as expected upon manufacture.

===Coping with variability===

A challenge most critical to analog IC design involves the variability of the individual devices built on the semiconductor chip. Unlike board-level circuit design which permits the designer to select devices that have each been tested and binned according to value, the device values on an IC can vary widely which are uncontrollable by the designer. For example, some IC resistors can vary ±20% and β of an integrated [[Bipolar junction transistor|BJT]] can vary from 20 to 100. In the latest CMOS processes, β of vertical PNP transistors can even go below 1. To add to the design challenge, device properties often vary between each processed semiconductor wafer. Device properties can even vary significantly across each individual IC due to doping [[gradients]]. The underlying cause of this variability is that many semiconductor devices are highly sensitive to uncontrollable random variances in the process. Slight changes to the amount of diffusion time, uneven doping levels, etc. can have large effects on device properties.

Some design techniques used to reduce the effects of the device variation are:
* Using the ratios of resistors, which do match closely, rather than absolute resistor value.
* Using devices with matched geometrical shapes so they have matched variations.
* Making devices large so that statistical variations becomes an insignificant fraction of the overall device property.
* Segmenting large devices, such as resistors, into parts and interweaving them to cancel variations.
* Using [[common centroid]] device layout to cancel variations in devices which must match closely (such as the transistor differential pair of an [[op amp]]).

The '''International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences''' ('''IUAES''') is the largest world forum of [[anthropologist]]s and [[Ethnology|ethnologists]], with members from more than fifty countries. Every five years, in different parts of the world, the IUAES sponsors a major Congress (ICAES/World Congress), gathering researchers from all of the various subfields and branches of anthropology. The IUAES was founded under the auspices of [[UNESCO]] in 1948. The International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences (ICAES) had been separately founded in [[London]] in 1934. The two organizations united in 1948, and merged officially in 1968. In 2018, IUAES became one of the chambers of the newly established World Anthropological Union (WAU). The main objective of the IUAES is the internationalization of anthropology, and the cross-cultural honing and public dissemination of anthropological research perspectives.

== History ==

The earliest  predecessor of the IUAES was the International Congress of Anthropology and Prehistoric Archaeology, which was founded in [[La Spezia]], Italy, in 1865. In 1932, in [[Basel|Basle]], Switzerland, it was decided to split the congress into two sections, one for the Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences and one for the [[Prehistory|Prehistoric]] and [[Protohistory|Protohistoric]] [[Science]]s. This is how the ICAES was born, becoming operative in 1934, when it held its first meeting in [[London]], UK. Meetings were scheduled for every four years, but only one more congress was held, in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, in 1938, before World War II made it impossible for people to convene. It took ten years before the next congress was held, in 1948, in [[Brusel|Brussels]], Belgium. Here a special committee was established to be concerned solely with anthropological interests and this became the IUAES. It was formed under the aegis of [[UNESCO]] and became a member of the International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies ([[ICPHS]]), which it remains to this day. 

The four-year congress cycle continued with meetings in [[Vienna]] (1952), [[Philadelphia]] (1956), [[Paris]] (1960) and [[Moscow]] (1964). Up to this point the IUAES remained separate from the ICAES, and was presided over by different people until Henri Vallois took over both presidencies in 1956. Just four years prior to this, in 1952, the International Social Science Council ([[ISSC]]) was founded and the IUAES has been represented in it ever since. By 1964, at the ICAES in Moscow, it was decided that the two organizations be joined de facto. At the following congress, in [[Tokyo]] (1968), they were united de jure. At the same congress, it was also decided to change the time interval between congresses from four to five years, scheduling the following congress for 1973 in [[Chicago]]. At the subsequent congress, held in [[New Delhi]], India, in 1978, it was proposed to organize inter-congresses. These smaller meetings enable countries which do not have the resources to hold a large-scale congress to participate actively. IUAES Inter-Congresses are held with varied frequency in the five-year interval between congresses. To ensure the financial autonomy of the Union from its congresses, in 1998 it was decided to again separate the presidency of the IUAES from that of each succeeding ICAES. The ICAES scheduled for 2008 in Kunming, China, had to be postponed by one year, and was held in 2009 as the IUAES World Congress. The next World Congress was held in [[Manchester]], UK, in 2013.

== Structure ==
 
The IUAES has an administrative structure involving three bodies: the General Assembly, the Permanent Council, and the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee is the main regulatory body, making policy decisions on behalf of, and subject to the authority of, the Permanent Council. The Permanent Council consists of national delegations empowered to vote on any matters concerning the Union. The votes may follow discussions held at the General Assembly. The latter can also put forward proposals but has no decision-making authority. All policy decisions are implemented by the Executive Committee. The structural guidelines of the IUAES are given in its Statutes, which have grown from a simple set of rules into an array of constitutional by-laws.   

The core officers of the IUAES Executive Committee are the President, the Secretary-General and the Treasurer, with the Secretary-General maintaining all records of the Union and supervising all communications, including the production and dissemination of new IUAES publications (including Newsletters and Handbooks), as well as the designing and updating of the IUAES website. The current Secretary-General is [[Noel B. Salazar]]. The rest of the Executive Committee, that is, the past-president, the vice-presidents (with the president of the following congress acting as an additional vice-president) and the members-at-large, aid in the decision-making process. 

The scientific work of the IUAES is carried out by its Commissions, which focus on particular topics of specialized interest. The IUAES Commissions, of which more than thirty are currently recognized, (Nas and Zhang 2009:460-461),&lt;ref&gt;Nas, Peter J. M. and Zhang Jijiao, eds. (2009) ''Anthropology Now''. Beijing: Intellectual Property Rights Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; determine their own administrative structure and set of activities, which generally include the organization of panels, workshops, and sessions at the quinquennial ICAES. Some commissions have been in existence for decades, while others have rapidly disbanded. Some commissions have their own websites, organize their own conferences, and sponsor the publication of journals or book series. Groups of commissions sometimes co-sponsor initiatives of common interest, and it is possible for IUAES members to be involved in the work of multiple commissions.

== Mission ==

As stated in Article 3 of its Statutes, posted on the IUAES website, the objectives of the Union are:
* To develop international scientific and professional co-operation (consistent with the Charter of UNESCO) in the fields of anthropology and ethnology, in the broadest sense in which these are understood in different parts of the world, and related disciplines and areas of study; 
* To foster the development of scientific and professional institutions internationally and regionally; 
* To stimulate scientific and professional co-operation among institutions devoted to relevant fields of knowledge; 
* To co-operate with other international organizations, and particularly, though not exclusively, with the [[International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies]], the [[International Social Science Council]], the [[International Council of Scientific Unions]], and the [[International Council of Museums]]; 
* To develop appropriate roles for anthropology and ethnology in international inter-disciplinary scientific endeavors; 
* To take appropriate steps to meet any other objectives consistent with the international scientific and professional concerns of the membership, as determined by the Permanent Council and the Executive Committee.

Reaching these objectives requires the internationalization of anthropological practice through cross-cultural exchanges based on inclusive, democratic, and intellectually pluralistic policies. These needs were formally acknowledged under the leadership of  Cyril S. Belshaw, president in the period 1978-1983, who sensed that "the mood is to place the Union on an active footing" (Belshaw, 1979: 244).&lt;ref&gt;Belshaw, Cyril S. (1979) "Message from the President" ''Current Anthropology'' 20(1):244-245.&lt;/ref&gt; The IUAES Congresses and Inter-Congresses catalyze this process, which is also facilitated by the development and maintenance of efficient channels of membership-wide communication. Initially, news about the IUAES was disseminated through ''Current Anthropology'', the journal of the [[Wenner-Gren Foundation]], which also supported the IUAES. Starting in 1981, however, Dr. [[Eric Sunderland]]—the longest serving and one of the most influential, and beloved, IUAES Secretary-Generals—introduced a Newsletter, which he continued to edit and distribute until he moved from his post to become President of the IUAES. Dr. Peter J. M. Nas, who became the next Secretary-General, continued and expanded the publication of the Newsletter, and also developed an official website ([http://www.leidenuniv.nl/fsw/iuaes]), which rapidly became the central point of contact for the Union.

The Williamsburg Congress of 1998 marked the end of a century of anthropology by highlighting that: "No discipline is more important for teaching people about themselves and others, and how they may live together in the next century, than anthropology" (Shahshahani, 1999:5).&lt;ref&gt;Shahshahani, Soheila (1999) "ICAES, Williamsburg 1998" International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences Newsletter 52.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also pointed out that:"Anthropology is either truly international or not at all"(Godina, 1999:vii).&lt;ref&gt;Godina, Vesna (1999) "Foreword" in  ''Anthropological Theory in North America''. E. L. Cerroni-Long, ed., Westport, CT, Bergin &amp; Garvey.&lt;/ref&gt; The IUAES, which celebrated the 60th anniversary of its founding in 2008, enters the second decade of the 21st century with a renewed sense of the importance of its mission, and urgency of its objectives.

[[Image:Jackshaft two belt pulleys.png|thumb|A two-pulley jackshaft redirecting belt power from horizontal to vertical.]]

A '''jackshaft''', also called a ''countershaft'', is a common mechanical design component used to transfer or synchronize rotational force in a machine. A jackshaft is often just a short stub with supporting bearings on the ends and two pulleys, gears, or cranks attached to it.  In general, a jackshaft is any shaft that is used as an intermediary transmitting [[Horsepower|power]] from a driving shaft to a driven shaft.

==History==
===Jackshaft===
The oldest uses of the term ''jackshaft'' appear to involve shafts that were intermediate between [[water wheel]]s or [[stationary steam engine]]s and the [[line shaft]]s of 19th century mills.&lt;ref&gt;James Emerson, Report of Water-Wheel Tests at Lowell and Other Places, [https://books.google.com/books?id=S3FDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA177 Journal of the Franklin Institute], Vol. LXIII, No. 3 (March, 1872); pages 177-178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holyoke Warter Power Co., Experiments with Gears, Belts and Draft Tubes, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HD1EAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA73 Holyoke Hydrodynamic Experiments], Weaver Shipman and Co., Springfield, Mass., 1880; pages 73-76.&lt;/ref&gt;  In these early sources from [[New England]] mills in 1872 and 1880, the term ''"jack shaft"'' always appears in quotes.  Another 1872 author wrote "Gear wheels are used in England to transmit the power of the engine to what is usually called the jack shaft."&lt;ref name="Sellers1872"&gt;Coleman Sellers, Transmission of Motion, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XNgGAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 Journal of the Franklin Institute], Vol. LXIV, No. 5 (Nov. 1872); pages 305-319, ''countershaft'' is defined on page 314, ''jack shaft'' on page 316.&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1892, the quotes were gone, but the use remained the same.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Grimshaw, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NJcPAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA224Rope Drive for Power Transmission], [[Cassier's Magazine]] Vol. II, No. 9 (July 1892); pages 219-224, see particularly figure 1 and the discussion of it on pages 223-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pulleys on the jackshafts of mills or power plants were frequently connected to the shaft with [[clutch]]es.  For example, in the 1890s, the generating room of the Virginia Hotel in Chicago had two [[Corliss engine]]s and five [[dynamo]]s, linked through a jackshaft.  Clutches on the jackshaft pulleys allowed any or all of the dynamos to be driven by either or both of the engines.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Flather, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q5dKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=42 Rope-Driving:  A treatise on the transmission of power by means of fibrous ropes], Wiley, New York, 1895; pages 42-43. Fig. 21 shows part of the jack-shaft.&lt;/ref&gt;  With the advent of [[Chain drive#Automobiles|chain-drive vehicles]], the term ''jackshaft'' was generally applied to the final intermediate shaft in the drive train, either a chain driven shaft driving pinions that directly engaged teeth on the inside of the rims of the drive wheels,&lt;ref&gt;The Darling Steam Carriage, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5IVMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA316 The Horseless Age], Vol. 5, No. 2 (Oct. 11, 1899); page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some New American Steam Carriages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ojofAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA565 The Motor Car Journal], Vol I, No. 36 (Nov. 10, 1899); page 565.&lt;/ref&gt; or the output shaft of the transmission/differential that is linked by chain to the drive wheels.&lt;ref&gt;The Grout Steam Tonneau, [https://books.google.com/books?id=J0eOQXpW6MEC&amp;pg=PA55 Cycle and Automobile Trade Journal] Vol II, No. 8 (Feb 1, 1902) ;pages 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first uses of the term ''jackshaft'' in the context of railroad equipment was in an 1890 patent application by Samuel Mower.  In his electric-motor driven [[railroad truck]], the motor was geared to a jackshaft mounted between the side frames.  A sliding [[Dog clutch]] inside the jackshaft was used to select one of several gear ratios on the chain drive to the driven axle.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel E. Mower, Electric-Motor Mechanism, {{US patent|450970}}, issued Apr. 21, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later railroad jackshafts were generally connected to the driving wheels using [[side rod]]s; see [[Jackshaft (locomotive)]] for details.
===Countershaft===
The term ''countershaft'' is somewhat older.  In 1828, the term was used to refer to an intermediate horizontal shaft in a [[gristmill]] driven through gearing by the [[waterwheel]] and driving the [[millstones]] through bevel gears.&lt;ref&gt;James Hindman and William Hindman, Improvement in the Grist Mill, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xaM1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA324 The American Journal of Improvements in the Useful Arts and Mirror of the Patent Office in the United States], Vol I, No. 3 (July, Aug. and Sept. 1828); page 324.  This reads like a patent application, there is no record of a corresponding patent.&lt;/ref&gt;  An 1841 textbook used the term to refer to a short shaft driven by a [[Belt drive|belt]] from the [[line shaft]] and driving the spindle of a [[Lathe (metal)|lathe]] through additional belts.  The countershaft and the lathe spindle each carried cones of different-diameter [[pulley]]s for speed control.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Willis, Part the Third, Chapter II -- To Alter the Velocity Ratio by Determinate Changes, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ty84AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA433 Principles of Mechanism Designed for the Use of Students in the Universities and for Engineering Students Generally], John W. Parker, London, 1841; page 433.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1872, this definition was given:  "The term countershaft is applied to all shafts driven from the main line &lt;nowiki&gt;[shaft]&lt;/nowiki&gt; when placed at or near the machines to be driven ..."&lt;ref name="Sellers1872" /&gt;
;Modern uses
Modern jackshafts and countershafts are often hidden inside large machinery as components of the larger overall device.

[[Image:TractorPTOshaftMay04.jpg|thumb|A PTO Shaft or jackshaft with a protective shield to prevent entanglement.]]
In farm equipment, a spinning output shaft on the rear of the vehicle is commonly referred to as the ''[[power take-off|Power Take-Off]]'' or PTO, and the power-transfer shaft that is connected to it is commonly called a ''PTO shaft'', but is also a jackshaft.

'''Kirk R. Smith''' is an expert on the health and [[global warming|climate]] effects of household energy use in developing nations. He is currently a professor of Global Environmental Health at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where his research focuses on the relationships among environmental quality, health, resource use, climate, development, and policy in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://ehs.sph.berkeley.edu/people/smithk.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Smith contributed a great deal to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)]], and the work of the IPCC (including the contributions of many scientists) was recognised by the joint award of the [[2007 Nobel Peace Prize|2007]] [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. Smith is a recipient of the 2012 [[Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement]] for his work with cookstoves, health, and climate. He is also credited with designing and implementing the first [[randomized controlled trial]] of the health effects of [[indoor air pollution in developing countries|indoor air pollution (IAP)]] from [[cook stove|cookstoves]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humanrights.gov/2012/09/26/fact-sheet-global-alliance-for-clean-cookstoves-progress/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Smith grew up in the [[California]] [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]], where he attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Here, he received his Bachelor of Arts (1968) in [[Physics]] and [[Astronomy]], his [[Master of Public Health]] (1972) in Environmental Health Sciences, and his [[PhD|Doctorate (PhD)]] (1977) in Biomedical and Environmental Health with a focus on Energy &amp; Environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://ehs.sph.berkeley.edu/krsmith/&lt;/ref&gt; His studies at Berkeley led to developments in coal-ash recycling and nuclear risk assessment, and were conducted under the advisorship of the current [[Office of Science and Technology Policy|Science Advisor]] to U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], [[John Holdren]]. After finishing his PhD, Smith moved to Hawaii where he founded the Energy Program at the East-West Center. He led the center's work on energy research problems in the Asia-Pacific regions until 1985, when he became the coordinator for environmental risk research. In 1995, Smith returned to [[UC Berkeley]] where he joined the faculty at the [[UC Berkeley School of Public Health]]. He is currently a Professor of Global Environmental Health, the founder and co-Director of the university's Global Health and Environment Program, and Associate Director for International Programs at the Center for Occupational and Environmental Health.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tylerprize.usc.edu/laureates.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''liana''' is any of various long-[[Plant stem|stemmed]], [[Woody plant|woody]] [[vine]]s that are [[root]]ed in the soil at ground level and use trees, as well as other means of vertical support, to climb up to the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] to get access to well-lit areas of the forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/338786/liana |title=liana|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lianas are characteristic of [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist deciduous forests]] (especially [[Tropical seasonal forest|seasonal forests]]), but may be found in [[temperate rainforests]]. There are also [[temperate]] lianas, for example the members of the ''[[Clematis]]'' or ''[[Vitis]]'' (wild grape) genera. Lianas can form bridges amidst the forest canopy, providing [[Arboreal locomotion|arboreal]] animals with paths across the forest. These bridges can protect weaker trees from strong winds. Lianas compete with forest trees for sunlight, water and nutrients from the soil.&lt;ref name="SCHNITZER-BONGERS"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schnitzer |first1=S. A. |last2=Bongers |first2=F. |year=2002 |title=The ecology of lianas and their role in forests |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=223–230 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02491-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forests without lianas grow 150% more fruit; trees with lianas have twice the probability of dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Landers|first1=Jackson|title=Tarzan's Favorite Mode of Travel, the Liana Vine, Chokes Off a Tree's Ability to Bear Fruit|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/tarzans-mode-travel-liana-vine-chocking-tropical-forests-180963636/|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|date=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "liana" is not a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] grouping, but rather a description of the way the plant grows – much like "[[tree]]" or "[[shrub]]". Lianas may be found in many different plant [[family (biology)|families]]. One way of distinguishing lianas from trees and shrubs is based on the [[stiffness]], specifically, the [[Young's modulus]] of various parts of the stem. Trees and shrubs have young twigs and smaller branches which are quite flexible and older growth such as [[Trunk (botany)|trunks]] and large branches which are stiffer. A liana often has stiff young growths and older, more flexible growth at the base of the stem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3732/ajb.92.8.1381 | title = Evolution of shrub-like growth forms in the lianoid subfamily Secamonoideae (Apocynaceae s.l.) of Madagascar: phylogeny, biomechanics, and development | year = 2005 | author = Lahaye, R. | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 92 | pages = 1381–96 | last2 = Civeyrel | first2 = L. | last3 = Speck | first3 = T. | last4 = Rowe | first4 = N.

As noted by [[Charles Darwin]], because lianas are supported by other plants, they may conserve resources that other plants must allocate to the development of structure and use them instead for growth and reproduction. In general, lianas are detrimental to the trees that support them. Growth rates are lower for trees with lianas; they directly damage hosts by mechanical abrasion and strangulation, render hosts more susceptible to ice and wind damage, and increase the probability that the host tree falls. Lianas also make the canopy of trees more accessible to animals which eat leaves. Because of these negative effects, trees which remain free of lianas are at an advantage; some species have evolved characteristics which help them avoid or shed lianas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/2387889| jstor = 2387889| pages = 19–23| title = How trees avoid and shed lianas| journal = Biotropica| volume = 16| issue = 1| year = 1984| author1 = Putz | first1 = F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2604">'''Making Sense of Abstinence''' is a collection of 16 lessons for teaching about [[sexual abstinence]] in the context of comprehensive [[sexuality education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getthefactsny.org/educators/documents/NewMakingSenseFlyer.pdf|title=Empire State Acts|website=Getthefactsny.org|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Minnesota Organization on Adolescent Pregnancy, Prevention, and Parenting, it is "a [[curriculum]] that takes [[abstinence]] beyond a one-dimensional scope of 'just say no,'...[utilizing] positive and engaging activities to help young people think about [[abstinence]] in a way that values their ability to make decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moappp.org/Documents/MakingSenseAbstinence.pdf|format=PDF|title=Making Sense of Abstinence : Lessons for Comprehensive Sexuality Education|website=Moappp.org|date=February 8, 2006|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sample lessons include such titles as "So What's An Abstinence Anyway?" "Hey, Mom?  Hey, Dad? Hey...Gram?  Can We Talk about Abstinence?" "Just Say Know," "Masturbation:  A Touchy Subject," "Handling Horny," and "Some Day:  Making the Transition from Sexual Abstinence".

The manual has received praise from sexuality educators for expanding the way [[sexuality education]] teaches about abstinence, and for teaching the subject in a positive way, unlike other fear-based approaches.  For example, the online journal "Sexual Intelligence" praised "Making Sense of Abstinence" for "not treating kids like robotic idiots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexualintelligence.org/newsletters/issue71.html#four|title=Sexual Intelligence by Marty Klein, Ph.D.|website=Sexualintelligence.org|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abstinence-only]] advocates have criticized the manual for including such topics as [[outercourse]] and [[masturbation]], behaviors they believe should not be acknowledged.  Critics also claim that teenagers should not learn information to protect themselves when their abstinence decisions change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faithandfreedom.us/pdf/abstinence_ed.pdf|format=PDF|title=Faith and Freedom|website=Faithandfreedom.us|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of "Making Sense of Abstinence" state that neither the "Just say no" approach, nor the "Always say yes," is appropriate for abstinence education.  Rather, they emphasize that teens need complete information to help them make the best decisions for themselves.

'''Malnutrition–inflammation complex''' (syndrome), abbreviated as "'''MICS'''" and also known as "'''[[malnutrition]]–[[inflammation]]–[[cachexia]] [[syndrome]]'''", is a common condition in [[chronic disease states]] such as [[chronic kidney disease]] (where it is also known as [[uremic malnutrition]] or [[protein–energy malnutrition]]) and [[chronic heart failure]].

The MICS is believed to be a cause of survival paradoxes seen in these distinct patient populations, also known as [[reverse epidemiology]] populations.

In [[toxicology]], the '''median lethal dose''', '''LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;''' (abbreviation for "[[lethal dose]], 50%"), '''LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;''' (lethal concentration, 50%) or '''LCt&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;''' is a measure of the [[lethal dose]] of a [[toxin]], [[radiation]], or [[pathogen]]. The value of LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; for a substance is the [[Dose (pharmacology)|dose]] required to kill half the members of a tested population after a specified test duration. LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; figures are frequently used as a general indicator of a substance's [[acute toxicity]].  A lower LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is indicative of increased toxicity.

The test was created by J.W. Trevan in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/ld50.html|title=What is a LD50 and LC50? : OSH Answers|first=Government of Canada, Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and|last=Safety|date=|website=www.ccohs.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''semilethal dose''' is occasionally used in the same sense, in particular with translations of foreign language text, but can also refer to a sublethal dose. LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is usually determined by tests on animals such as [[Laboratory mouse|laboratory mice]].
In 2011, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved alternative methods to LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; for testing the cosmetic drug [[Botox]] without animal tests.&lt;ref&gt;

== Conventions ==
The LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is usually expressed as the mass of substance administered per unit mass of test subject, typically as [[milligram]]s of substance per [[kilogram]] of body mass, sometimes also stated as [[nanogram]]s (suitable for [[botulinum]]), [[microgram]]s, or [[gram]]s (suitable for [[paracetamol]]) per kilogram. Stating it this way allows the relative toxicity of different substances to be compared, and normalizes for the variation in the size of the animals exposed (although toxicity does not always scale simply with body mass). For substances in the environment, such as poisonous vapors or substances in water that are toxic to fish, the concentration in the environment (per cubic metre or per litre) is used, giving a value of LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;. But in this case, the exposure time is important (see below).

The choice of 50% lethality as a benchmark avoids the potential for ambiguity of making measurements in the extremes and reduces the amount of testing required. However, this also means that LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is not the lethal dose for all subjects; some may be killed by much less, while others survive doses far higher than the LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;. Measures such as "LD&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;" and "LD&lt;sub&gt;99&lt;/sub&gt;" (dosage required to kill 1% or 99%, respectively, of the test population) are occasionally used for specific purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pdfs/97-119-a.pdf REGISTRY OF TOXIC EFFECTS OF CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES (RTECS)&lt;br&gt;COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE TO THE RTECS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516165953/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pdfs/97-119-a.pdf |date=2013-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lethal dosage often varies depending on the method of [[Drug administration|administration]]; for instance, many substances are less toxic when administered orally than when [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]] administered. For this reason, LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; figures are often qualified with the mode of administration, e.g., "LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; i.v."

The related quantities LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;/30 or LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;/60 are used to refer to a dose that without treatment will be lethal to 50% of the population within (respectively) 30 or 60 days. These measures are used more commonly within [[Radiation Health Physics]], as survival beyond 60 days usually results in recovery.

A comparable measurement is LCt&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, which relates to lethal dosage from exposure, where C is concentration and t is time. It is often expressed in terms of mg-min/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. ICt&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the dose that will cause incapacitation rather than death. These measures are commonly used to indicate the comparative efficacy of [[chemical warfare]] agents, and dosages are typically qualified by rates of breathing (e.g., resting = 10&amp;nbsp;l/min) for inhalation, or degree of clothing for skin penetration.  The concept of Ct was first proposed by [[Fritz Haber]] and is sometimes referred to as [[Haber's Law]], which assumes that exposure to 1 minute of 100&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is equivalent to 10 minutes of 10&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (1 × 100 = 100, as does 10 × 10 = 100).

Some chemicals, such as [[hydrogen cyanide]], are rapidly detoxified by the human body, and do not follow Haber's Law.  So, in these cases, the lethal concentration may be given simply as LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; and qualified by a duration of exposure (e.g., 10 minutes). The [[Material Safety Data Sheet]]s for toxic substances frequently use this form of the term even if the substance does follow Haber's Law.

For disease-causing organisms, there is also a measure known as the median infective dose and dosage. The median infective dose (ID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) is the number of organisms received by a person or test animal qualified by the route of administration (e.g., 1,200 org/man per oral). Because of the difficulties in counting actual organisms in a dose, infective doses may be expressed in terms of biological assay, such as the number of LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;'s to some test animal. In [[biological warfare]] infective dosage is the number of infective doses per cubic metre of air times the number of minutes of exposure (e.g., ICt&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is 100 medium doses - min/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

== Limitation ==
As a measure of toxicity, LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is somewhat unreliable and results may vary greatly between testing facilities due to factors such as the genetic characteristics of the sample population, animal species tested, environmental factors and mode of administration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ernest Hodgson (2004). ''A Textbook of Modern Toxicology''. Wiley-Interscience (3rd ed.).{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There can be wide variability between species as well; what is relatively safe for rats may very well be extremely toxic for humans (''[[cf.]]'' [[paracetamol toxicity]]), and vice versa. For example, chocolate, comparatively harmless to humans, is known to be [[Health effects of chocolate#Other animals|toxic to many animals]]. When used to test [[venom]] from venomous creatures, such as [[snake]]s, LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; results may be misleading due to the physiological differences between mice, rats, and humans. Many [[venomous snake]]s are specialized predators on mice, and their venom may be adapted specifically to incapacitate mice; and [[mongoose]]s may be exceptionally resistant. While most [[mammal]]s have a very similar physiology, LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; results may or may not have equal bearing upon every mammal species, such as humans, etc.

== Examples ==
Note: Comparing substances (especially drugs) to each other by LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; can be misleading in many cases due (in part) to differences in [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|effective dose]] (ED&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;).  Therefore, it is more useful to compare such substances by [[therapeutic index]], which is simply the ratio of LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; to ED&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

The following examples are listed in reference to LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values, in descending order, and accompanied by LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values, {bracketed}, when appropriate.

== Animal rights concerns ==
[[Animal rights|Animal-rights]] and [[Animal welfare|animal-welfare]] groups, such as Animal Rights International,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ari-online.org/main.html Thirty-Two Years of Measurable Change] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211201203/http://www.ari-online.org/main.html |date=2007-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have campaigned against LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; testing on animals. Several countries, including the [[United Kingdom|UK]], have taken steps to ban the oral LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) abolished the requirement for the oral test in 2001 (see Test Guideline 401, ''Trends in Pharmacological Sciences'' Vol 22, February 22, 2001).

== Principle ==

The mechanism of operation involves unsupervised separating or aliquoting of cell suspensions, or other liquid samples, into discrete recipient sites. The aliquoting effect is achieved due to the differences in wettability of the recipient sites and the surrounding area.&lt;ref name="MAMS" /&gt;

== Applications ==

MAMS are used in [[single-cell analysis]]; in particular, single-cell metabolomics.&lt;ref name="MAMS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Urban P.L., Schmidt A.M., Fagerer S.R., Amantonico A., Ibañez A., Jefimovs K., Heinemann M., Zenobi R. 2011, Carbon-13 labelling strategy for studying the ATP metabolism in individual yeast cells by micro-arrays for mass spectrometry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6108">In biology or medicine, a '''multi-access key''' is an [[identification key]] which overcomes the problem of the more traditional [[single-access key]]s ([[dichotomous key|dichotomous]] or [[polytomous key|polytomous identification keys]]) of requiring a fixed sequence of identification steps. A multi-access key enables the user to freely choose the characteristics that are convenient to evaluate for the item to be identified.&lt;ref name=Pankhurst&gt;Pankhurst, R. J. 1991. Practical Taxonomic Computing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Winston, J. 1999. Describing Species. Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|9780231068253}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although good single-access keys will try to start with characters that are reliable, convenient to observe and generally available throughout most of the year, it is often impossible to achieve this for all taxa in a key. A multi-access key lets the user adapt the key to the particular organism that is being identified and to the circumstances of identification (e.g. field or laboratory).

Multi-access keys may be printed in various way (tabular, matrix, formula style, etc.) but are more commonly used as computer-aided, interactive keys.

==Alternative terms==

Alternative terms used for multi-access keys are "random-access key", "multi-entry key", [[polyclave]], "matrix key", "tabular key", "synoptic key". Some of these terms should be avoided in this sense, however:

* "Multi-entry" keys allow the free choice of characters only in the first step, whereas in a typical multi-access key the choice of characters used for identification can be repeated multiple times (reducing the number of remaining taxa each time). The single step of selecting one or multiple criteria is followed by a dichotomous key for the species remaining after this step. 
* The terms "tabular key" and "matrix key" are best limited to a tabular presentation format of multi-access keys.&lt;ref&gt;Fig. 19.6 in Winston, J. 1999. Describing Species. Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The term "synoptic key" has an older definition, defining it as a key reflecting taxonomic classification and opposed to diagnostic keys arranged solely for the convenience of identification.&lt;ref name=Pankhurst/&gt;

==History==

Interactive multi-access keys are a high-tech descendent of polyclaves ("card keys"). Historically various styles of encoding features of species (such as flower color) on punch cards were used. Holes or notches in these cards would allow the user to choose cards based on characters observed in a specimen until only one card remained, yielding a tentative identification.&lt;ref name=Pankhurst/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

== Advantages ==

Multi-access keys largely serve the same purpose as single-access (dichotomous or polytomous) keys, but have many advantages, especially in the form of computer-aided, interactive keys.&lt;ref&gt;Dallwitz, M.J., Paine, T.A. and Zurcher, E.J. 2000 onwards. [http://delta-intkey.com/www/interactivekeys.htm Principles of interactive keys].&lt;/ref&gt;  The user of an interactive key may select or enter information about an unidentified specimen in any order, allowing the computer to interactively rule out possible identifications of the entity and present the user with additional helpful information and guidance on what information to enter next.  Full-featured interactive keys may readily be equipped with images, audio, video, supplemental text, much-simplified language in conjunction with technical language and hyperlinks to assist the user with understanding of both entities and features.&lt;ref name=brasher&gt;Brasher, J. W. 2006. [http://worldcat.org/oclc/122551481?tab=details The Southern Rocky Mountain Interactive Flora (SRMIF) and factors correlated with recognition of plants and mammals. University of Northern Colorado, Ph. D. Thesis.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Interactive keys remedy some of the problems outlined above.  The problem of language translations is made easier in interactive keys because characters and states frequently are simplified with less reliance on the intricate nuances of long strings of words.  The problem above where only one sex of an unknown specimen is at hand is mitigated because the user can simply use other characters.  The problem of not having a reliable and complete description to compare a specimen with is alleviated by full service interactive keys that include or link to such descriptions and authoritatively identified images.  The problem above about complete descriptions not being available in the field is also remedied if the interactive key is on a laptop or handheld computer.  With paper-based dichotomous keys the discovery of a new species renders the key incomplete; interactive keys are easily updated by adding information for newly discovered species and reposting computer files on the internet.&lt;ref name=brasher/&gt;

Many different computer programs for interactive keys are currently available, some of which are truly multi-access, and some not.&lt;ref&gt;Dallwitz, M.J. 1996 onwards. [http://delta-intkey.com/www/idprogs.htm Programs for interactive identification and information retrieval].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dallwitz, M.J. 2000 onwards. [http://delta-intkey.com/www/comparison.htm A comparison of interactive identification programs].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6378">'''Narrative [[criticism]]''' focuses on the stories a speaker or a writer tells to understand how they help us make meaning out of our daily human experiences. [[Narrative]] theory is a means by which we can comprehend how we impose order on our experiences and actions by giving them a narrative form. According to Walter Fisher,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Fisher | first = Walter | title = Human Communication as Narration: Toward a Philosophy of Reason, Value, and Action | place = Columbia | publisher = U of South Carolina P | year = 1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=February 2015}} narratives are fundamental to communication and provide structure for human experience and influence people to share common explanations and understandings (58). Fisher defines narratives as “symbolic actions-words and/or deeds that have sequence and meaning for those who live, create, or interpret them.” Study of narrative criticism, therefore, includes form (fiction or non-fiction, prose or poetry), [[genre]] (myth, history, legend, etc.), structure (including plot, [[Theme (literature) | theme]], [[irony]], foreshadowing, etc.) characterization, and communicator’s perspective.

Characteristics of a narrative were defined as early as [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' under plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Aristotle | title = Poetics | chapter = VI–VII}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He called plot as the “first principle” or the “soul of a [[tragedy]].” According to him, plot is the arrangement of incidents that imitate the action with a beginning, middle, and end. Plot includes introduction of characters, rising action and introduction of complication, development of complication, [[climax (narrative)]], and final resolution. As described by White  (1981)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= White |first= H |work= On Narrative |title= The Value of Narrativity in the Representation of Culture |editor-first = WJT |editor-last= Mitchell |place= Chicago |publisher= U of Chicago Press |year= 1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=February 2015}} and Martin  (1986),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Martin | first = W | title = Recent Theories of Narrative | place = Ithaca, NY | publisher = Cornell UP | year = 1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=February 2015}} plot involves a structure of action.  However, not all narratives contain a plot. Fragmentation occurs as the traditional plot disappears, narratives become less linear, and the burden of meaning making gets shifted from the narrator to the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Michael Calvin | last1 = McGee | first2 = John S | last2 = Nelson | first3 = Michael | last3 = Sizemore |  year = 1990 | title = Narrative Reason in Public Argument}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=February 2015}}

Narratives can be found in a range of practices such as novels, short stories, plays, films, histories, documentaries, gossip, biographies, television and scholarly books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = James | last = Jasinski | title = Sourcebook on Rhetoric | place = California | publisher = Sage | year = 2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=February 2015}}  All of these artifacts make excellent objects for narrative criticism. When performing a narrative criticism, critics should focus on the features of the narrative that allow them to say something meaningful about the artifact. Sample questions from Sonja K Foss&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Sonja K | last = Foss | title = Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice | place = Illinois | publisher = Waveland | year = 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|312-313}} offer a guide for analysis:
* Setting – How does the setting relate to the plot and characters? How is the particular setting created? Is the setting textually prominent – highly developed and detailed – or negligible?
* Characters ([[Persona]]) – Are some of the characters non-human or inanimate phenomena, described as thinking and speaking beings? In what actions do the characters engage? Are the characters round (possess a variety of traits, some of them conflicting or contradictory) or flat (one or a few dominant traits making the character predictable)?
* [[Narrator]] – Is the narrative presented directly to the audience, or is it mediated by a narrator? What makes the narrator intrusive or not? What kind of person is the narrator (examine his or her ethos)?
* Events – What are the major and minor events? How are the events presented? Are the events active (expressing action) or stative (expressing a state or condition)?
* Temporal relations – Do events occur in a brief period of time or over many years? What is the relationship between the natural order of the events as they occurred and the order of their presentation in the telling of a narrative? Is the story in past or present tense?
*[[Causal]] relations – What cause-and-effect relationships are established in the narrative? Are events caused largely by human action, accident, or forces of nature? In how much detail are the causes and effects described?
*[[Audience]] – Is the audience a participant in the events recounted? What can be inferred about the audience’s attitudes, knowledge, or situation from the narrative? What seems to be the narrator’s evaluation of the audience’s knowledge, personality, and abilities?
*[[Theme (literature)|Theme]] – What is the major theme (general idea illustrated by the narrative) of the narrative? How is the theme articulated? How obvious and clear is the theme?
*Limitations: Traditional narrative criticism focuses primarily on the narrative and does not take the socioeconomic and political background into consideration; however, it is not opposed to New-Historicism theory. In addition, it does not take the narrator's motivations into consideration as it focuses on the narrative to generate the analysis. Also, as the critic looks at the overall unity of the narrative, the theory is not conducive to deconstruction techniques (19-20).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gale A. Yee|Yee, Gale]].

The '''Order Paper''' is a daily publication in the [[Westminster system]] of government which lists the business of [[parliament]] for that day's sitting. A separate paper is issued daily for each house of the legislature.

The Order Paper provides [[Member of Parliament|members of the legislature]] with details of what will be happening in that house, including the questions that have been tabled for departmental question sessions and members who have been selected to speak. It also gives details of when and where the [[standing committees]] and [[select committee (Westminster system)|select committee]]s will be meeting, and the list of debates to be held. Written questions tabled to ministers by members of the legislature on the previous day are listed at the back of the order paper.

British parliamentarians often wave their Order Paper during debates in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].

A [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] [[codec]] is a type of audio coder-decoder (codec) that uses digital signal processing to transmit audio digitally over standard telephone lines ("Plain Old Telephone Service") at a higher level of audio quality than the telephone line would normally provide in its analog mode. The POTS codec is one of a family of broadcast codecs differentiated by the type of telecommunications circuit used for transmission. The '''ISDN codec''', which instead uses [[ISDN]] lines, and the IP codec which uses private or public IP networks are also common.

Primarily used in [[broadcast engineering]] to link remote broadcast locations to the host studio, a [[computer hardware|hardware]] [[codec]], implemented with [[digital signal processing]], is used to [[audio data compression|compress the audio data]] enough to travel through a pair of a 33.6k modems.

POTS codecs have the disadvantages of being restricted to relatively low bit rates and being susceptible to variable line quality. ISDN and IP codecs have the advantage of being natively [[Digital data|digital]], and operate at much higher bitrates, which results in fewer [[compression artifact]]s. Special lines must be run to a location, however, and must be ordered well in advance of the event so that there is ample time for installation of equipment.  Since POTS lines are almost universally available, the POTS codec can be set up nearly anywhere with little or no notice.

==Uses==
The main use of a broadcast codec is for [[remote broadcast]]ing by [[Radio broadcasting|radio stations]].

==Functions==
Codecs usually come in two types of units: [[rackmount]] for the [[studio]] and [[wikt:portable|portable]] for the remote.  Audio can be sent in either direction, and most can also pass low-speed non-audio data, allowing the remote [[DJ]] to control [[broadcast automation]] or other studio equipment via [[RS-232]].  Many have an [[automatic redial]] if the line should become disconnected.  The remote unit usually has some basic [[mixing console|mixer]] functions, while the studio unit usually has some kind of digital output.

Some codecs can be configured to use ISDN, POTS or IP rather than requiring a different device for each network, while others are exclusively designed for POTS operation. ISDN and IP connections implement algorithms like [[G.722]], [[MPEG]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], [[aacPlus]], [[Apt-X]] and [[AAC-LD]] (low-[[Lag|delay]]), while POTS connections almost always use proprietary low bit rate algorithms. Consequently, while ISDN connections can usually be established between codecs from different manufacturers, POTS connections (and usually IP connections) can only be established between codecs from the same family. Some codecs can use [[GSM]] networks, and some have [[variable bitrate]] to [[compensation (engineering)|compensate]] for poor connections.  It is sometimes possible to bond two POTS lines together for [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] and [[fault tolerance]], and improved [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]].

Codecs are made by [[Comrex]], [[Sonifex]], [[Tieline]], APT, [[Telos Systems|Telos]] and [[Prodys]]  among others.

'''Photofermentation''' is the [[Fermentative hydrogen production|fermentative]] conversion of organic substrate to [[biohydrogen]] manifested by a diverse group of [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[bacteria]] by a series of [[biochemical]] reactions involving three steps similar to [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic conversion]]. Photofermentation differs from [[dark fermentation]] because it only proceeds in the presence of [[light]].

For example, photo-fermentation with ''[[Rhodobacter sphaeroides]]'' SH2C (or many other purple non-sulfur bacteria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Redwood MD, Paterson-Beedle M, Macaskie LE | title = Integrating dark and light bio-hydrogen production strategies: towards the hydrogen economy. | journal = Reviews in Environmental Science and Bio/Technology | date = June 2009 | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 149 | doi =10.1007/s11157-008-9144-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) can be employed to convert small molecular fatty acids into [[hydrogen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tao Y, Chen Y, Wu Y, He Y, Zhou Z | title = High hydrogen yield from a two-step process of dark-and photo-fermentation of sucrose. | journal = International Journal of Hydrogen Energy | date = February 2007 | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 200–6 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijhydene.2006.06.034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other products.

&lt;br /&gt;
== Light-dependent pathways ==

=== Phototropic bacteria ===
[[Phototroph|Phototropic bacteria]] produce hydrogen gas via photofermentation, where the hydrogen is sourced from organic compounds.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Ghimire A, Frunzo L, Pirozzi F, Trably E, Escudie R, Lens PN, Esposito G |date= April 2015 |title=A review on dark fermentative biohydrogen production from organic biomass: Process parameters and use of by-products |journal=Applied Energy |volume=144 |pages=73–95 |doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.01.045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;chem&gt;C6H12O6 + 6H2O -&gt;[{hv}] 6CO2 + 12H2&lt;/chem&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Photolytic producers ===
[[Photolysis|Photolytic]] producers are similar to phototrophs, but source hydrogen from water molecules that are broken down as the organism interacts with light.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Photolytic producers consist of algae and certain photosynthetic bacteria.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

&lt;chem&gt;12H2O -&gt;[{hv}] 12H2 + 6O2&lt;/chem&gt;(algae)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

&lt;chem&gt;CO + H2O -&gt;[{hv}] H2 + CO2&lt;/chem&gt;(photolytic bacteria)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Sustainable energy production ==
Photofermentation via purple nonsulfur producing bacteria has been explored as a method for the production of biofuel.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Corneli E, Adessi A, Olguín EJ, Ragaglini G, García-López DA, De Philippis R | title = Biotransformation of water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes) to biohydrogen by Rhodopseudomonas palustris | journal = Journal of Applied Microbiology | volume = 123 | issue = 6 | pages = 1438–1446 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 28972701 | doi = 10.1111/jam.13599 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The natural fermentation product of these bacteria, hydrogen gas, can be harnessed as a natural gas energy source.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Laurinavichene T, Tekucheva D, Laurinavichius K, Tsygankov A | title = Utilization of distillery wastewater for hydrogen production in one-stage and two-stage processes involving photofermentation | journal = Enzyme and Microbial Technology | volume = 110 | pages = 1–7 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29310850 | doi = 10.1016/j.enzmictec.2017.11.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uyar B | title = Bioreactor design for photofermentative hydrogen production | journal = Bioprocess and Biosystems Engineering | volume = 39 | issue = 9 | pages = 1331–40 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27142376 | doi = 10.1007/s00449-016-1614-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Photofermentation via algae instead of bacteria is used for bioethanol production, among other liquid fuel alternatives.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Costa RL, Oliveira TV, Ferreira J, Cardoso VL, Batista FR | title = Prospective technology on bioethanol production from photofermentation | journal = Bioresource Technology | volume = 181 | pages = 330–7 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25678298 | doi = 10.1016/j.biortech.2015.01.090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bioreactor principle.svg|thumb|Basic principles of a bioreactor. The photofermentation bioreactor would not include an air pathway.]]

=== Mechanism ===
The bacteria and their energy source are held in a [[bioreactor]] chamber that is impermeable to air and oxygen free.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The proper temperature for the bacterial species is maintained in the bioreactor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The bacteria are sustained with a carbohydrate diet consisting of simple [[Carbohydrate|saccharide]] molecules.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang Q, Wang Y, Zhang Z, Lee DJ, Zhou X, Jing Y, Ge X, Jiang D, Hu J, He C | title = Photo-fermentative hydrogen production from crop residue: A mini review | journal = Bioresource Technology | volume = 229 | pages = 222–230 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28108074 | doi = 10.1016/j.biortech.2017.01.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbohydrates are typically sourced from agricultural or forestry waste.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Variations ===
[[File:Green_algae_in_a_bioreactor.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Green_algae_in_a_bioreactor.jpg|thumb|Depiction of algae (species not specified) in a bioreactor suitable for bioethanol production.]]
In addition to wild type forms of ''[[Rhodopseudomonas palustris]], s''cientists have used [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]] forms to produce hydrogen as well.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other explorations include expanding the bioreactor system to hold a combination of bacteria, [[algae]] or [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ethanol production is performed by the algae [[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii|''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'']], among other species, in cycling light and dark environments.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The cycling of light and dark environments has also been explored with bacteria for hydrogen production, increasing hydrogen yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Chen CY, Yang MH, Yeh KL, Liu CH, Chang JS |date= September 2008 |title=Biohydrogen production using sequential two-stage dark and photo fermentation processes |journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=33|issue=18|pages=4755–4762|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.06.055 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advantages ===
The bacteria are typically fed with broken down agricultural waste or undesired crops, such as water lettuce or sugar beet molasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keskin T, Hallenbeck PC | title = Hydrogen production from sugar industry wastes using single-stage photofermentation | journal = Bioresource Technology | volume = 112 | pages = 131–6 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22420990 | doi = 10.1016/j.biortech.2012.02.077 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The high abundance of such waste ensures the stable food source for the bacteria and productively uses human-produced waste.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In comparison with [[dark fermentation]], photofermentation produces more hydrogen per reaction and avoids the acidic end products of dark fermentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandrasekhar K, Lee YJ, Lee DW | title = Biohydrogen production: strategies to improve process efficiency through microbial routes | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 8266–93 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25874756 | pmc = 4425080 | doi = 10.3390/ijms16048266 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limitations ===
The primary limitations of photofermentation as a sustainable energy source stem from the precise requirements of maintaining the bacteria in the bioreactor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Researchers have found it difficult to maintain a constant temperature for the bacteria within the bioreactor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, the growth media for the bacteria must be rotated and refreshed without introducing air to the bioreactor system, complicating the already expensive bioreactor set up.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Image:Technics SL-1210MK2 pitch control.jpeg|thumb|150px|Technics SL-1210MK2 turntable pitch control slider]]

A variable speed '''pitch control''' (or '''vari-speed''') is a control on an audio device such as a [[phonograph|turntable]], [[tape recorder]], or [[CD player]] that allows the operator to deviate from a standard speed (such as 33⅓, 45 or even 78 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] on a turntable). The latter term "vari-speed" is more commonly used for tape decks, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. Analog pitch controls vary the voltage being used by the playback device; digital controls use [[digital signal processing]] to change the playback speed or pitch. A typical DJ deck allows the pitch to be increased or reduced by up to 8%, which is achieved by increasing or reducing the speed at which the platter rotates. 

Turntable or CD playing speed may be changed for [[beatmatching]] and other [[DJ]] techniques, while [[pitch shift]] using a pitch control has myriad uses in [[sound recording]].

== Vari-speed in consumer cassette decks ==

[[Superscope, Inc.]] of [[Sun Valley, Los Angeles|Sun Valley]] added vari-speed as a feature of portable cassette decks in 1975.  The C-104 and C-105 models incorporated this feature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rainerlinz.net/NMA/articles/Ferric-oxide.html Ferric-oxide Archeology,6. Superscopes and varispeed]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marantz Far East In Name Change; Adds Superscope, Billboard Magazine, December 7, 1974, Page 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Superscope [[trademark]]ed the name '''Vari-Speed''' in 1974.  The trademark category was '''Computer &amp; Software Products &amp; Electrical &amp; Scientific Products.'''  The trademark goods and Services use was '''Magnetic tape recorders and reproducers'''.  The trademark expired in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mytrademarkia.com/varispeed-73025543.html Vari-Speed trademark 73025543]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ourvinylweighsaton.com Musical Instruments &amp; Musical Recorder]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Plant Engineering and Maintenance Association of Canada''' (PEMAC) is a national, not-for-profit industry and technical association for plant and facility maintenance, reliability and physical asset management practitioners and professionals in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pemac.org/ Plant Engineering and Maintenance Association of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1989, PEMAC was born.

== PEMAC Activities ==
=== Certification Program ===
In an effort to establish a clear set of standards for professional development in the field of maintenance management PEMAC has set about standardizing the training for practitioners and professionals across Canada in cooperation with various Colleges, Institutes and Universities through the [[Maintenance Management Professional]] (MMP) certificate program. Individuals wishing to use the "Maintenance Management Professional" (MMP) designation must complete a 225-hour training program made up of 8 courses, apply for certification from PEMAC and be a member in good standing of the Plant Engineering and Maintenance Association of Canada.  Prior learning recognition is available for up to 6 of the courses.

PEMAC launched a second certificate program in fall 2014 that introduces tools for strategic decision making at each stage of the asset lifecycle. The Asset Management Professional (AMP) Certificate program presents participants with the latest in strategic asset management thinking from recognized global organizations, while developing the capacity to engage others and build their knowledge and skill in key subject areas such as risk management, knowledge management (enterprise database systems).

The AMP program is designed for mid-career professionals from a variety of backgrounds (IT, engineering and business management) who have responsibility for managing decisions with respect to the core life cycle functions such as design, selection, operation, and maintenance of an organization’s assets. Similar to PEMAC’s signature MMP program, the AMP program it finishes with a “Capstone” project, offering the opportunity to apply the participants' new knowledge and skills to develop a real-life project recommendation. The first set of participants completed the program in winter of 2016, and were the first in the world to be CAMP certified.

The MMP program has been recognized by Alberta Industry Training for the Blue Seal "Achievement in Business Competencies" program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tradesecrets.gov.ab.ca/index.html?page=working_in_alberta/business_credentials.html Alberta Industry Training - Business Competencies]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition both the Alberta Water Wastewater Operators Association  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awwoa.ab.ca/?object=6 AWWOA Recognized CEUs]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ontario Water and Wastewater Certification Office&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.owwco.ca/ Ontario Water and Wastewater Certification Office]&lt;/ref&gt; recognize courses in the program for Continuing Education Credits. PEMAC is also recognized by the Society for Maintenance and Reliability Professionals (SMRP) as an "Approved Education Provider". Consider studying MMP or AMP courses if you are seeking to achieve -or- maintain your CMRP certification.

=== Chapter Activity ===
Local chapters organize regular networking and professional development events across the country.

Polyculturalism is an ideological approach to the consequences of intercultural engagements within a geographical area which emphasises similarities between, and the enduring interconnectedness of, groups which self-identify as distinct, thus blurring the boundaries which may be perceived by members of those groups.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal&amp;Levy2010"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1751-2409.2010.01022.x|title=The Colorblind, Multicultural, and Polycultural Ideological Approaches to Improving Intergroup Attitudes and Relations|journal=Social Issues and Policy Review|volume=4|pages=215–246|year=2010|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Lisa|last2=Levy|first2=Sheri R}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from [[multiculturalism]] which instead emphasises the separateness of the identities of self-identifying cultural groups with an aim of preserving and celebrating their differences in spite of interactions between them. Supporters of polyculturalism oppose multiculturalism, arguing that the latter's emphasis on difference and separateness is divisive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hikevipadan.blogspot.com//%7B%7Bfull%7D%7D|title=Polyculturalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sbs.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/topics/life/culture/article/2017/06/07/if-multiculturalism-isnt-working-why-not-embrace-polyculturalism%7B%7Bfull%7D%7D|title=Latest News &amp; Opinion on Culture &amp; Social Affairs - SBS Life|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and harmful to social cohesion.&lt;ref name="JP&amp;MA2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Podur|first1=Justin|last2=Albert|first2=Michael|date=15 July 2003|title=Revolutionizing Culture Part One|url=https://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/10125|journal=Podur ZMag|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611094904/https://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/10125|archive-date=11 Jun 2008|access-date=17 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of polyculturalism was first proposed by [[Robin Kelley]] and [[Vijay Prashad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/cultures-fuse-and-connect-so-we-should-embrace-polyculturalism-78876|title=Cultures fuse and connect, so we should embrace polyculturalism|first=Nick|last=Haslam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Links to Other Areas of Thought==
Research has shown that belief in polyculturalism is linked to cultural intelligence (CQ) in [[Australia]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name="BP2017"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2017.08.006|title=Belief in polyculturalism and cultural intelligence: Individual- and country-level differences|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=119|pages=307–310|year=2017|last1=Bernardo|first1=Allan B.I|last2=Presbitero|first2=Alfred}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that polyculturists are less likely to demonstrate [[sexism|sexist]] attitudes.&lt;ref name="RLM2017"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684313510152 |pmid=25530662 |pmc=4266561 |title=Polyculturalism and Sexist Attitudes |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=519–534 |year=2014 |last1=Rosenthal |first1=Lisa |last2=Levy |first2=Sheri R |last3=Militano |first3=Maria }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that polyculturalism has a positive relationship with cross-cultural attitudes in both the [[Philippines]] and the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2012.12.005 |title=Polyculturalism and attitudes towards people from other countries |journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=335–344 |year=2013 |last1=Bernardo |first1=Allan B.I |last2=Rosenthal |first2=Lisa |last3=Levy |first3=Sheri R }}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Comparison of Cultural Ideologies==

{{refimprove-section|date=August 2018}}
{{Expand section|date=August 2018}}

Like advocates of [[multiculturalism]], proponents of polyculturalism encourage individuals to learn about different cultures, especially those they may come into contact with in their own areas.&lt;ref name="JK" /&gt; However whereas multiculturalism advocates for toleration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040823095427/http://www.semcoop.com/detail/0807050105%7B%7Bfull%7D%7D|title=Wayback Machine|date=23 August 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; between members of distictly different cultures groups, polyculturalism is less rigid and acknowledges that individual shape their own identities and may choose to change&lt;ref name="JP&amp;MA2003" /&gt; so as to express their culture in a different way to their own ancestors, either by adding elements of other cultures to it or by eliminating aspects of it.&lt;ref name="JK" /&gt;

Polyculturalism rejects the concept of race as a [[social construct]] with no scientific basis,&lt;ref name="JK"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Korber |first1=John |last2= |first2= |date= |title=Polyculturalism |url=http://members.aol.com/Jakajk/Oneworld.html |journal=One World One People |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014230838/http://members.aol.com/Jakajk/Oneworld.html |archive-date=14 Oct 2008 |access-date=17 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it recognises the concept of ethnicity&lt;ref name="AG"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibbons |first1=Andrea |last2= |first2= |date= |title=Vijay Prashad: Polyculturalism and Kung Fu |url=http://writingcities.com/2016/09/27/vijay-prashad-polyculturalism-kung-fu/ |dead-url= |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, considering ethno-nationalism a barrier which must be transcended in the pursuit of a dynamic community culture.

Critics of [[multiculturalism]] argue that it entrenches [[identity politics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0026490 |pmid=22250894 |title=The relation between polyculturalism and intergroup attitudes among racially and ethnically diverse adults |journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |year=2012 |last1=Rosenthal |first1=Lisa |last2=Levy |first2=Sheri R }}&lt;/ref&gt; while polyculturalism aims to forge a common new identity&lt;ref name="sbs.com.au"/&gt;

Polyculturalism acknowledges that cultures are dynamic, interactive and impure while [[multiculturalism]] treats them as static, isolated and complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Haslam |first1=Nick |title=Cultures fuse and connect, so we should embrace polyculturalism |url=https://theconversation.com/cultures-fuse-and-connect-so-we-should-embrace-polyculturalism-78876 |website=The Conversation |accessdate=25 August 2018 |language=en |date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a computer is different from [[binary number|binary]] [[digital electronic computer]]s based on [[transistor]]s.

A [[quantum Turing machine]] is a theoretical model of such a computer and is also known as the universal quantum computer.

(For comparison, a terabyte of digital information is only 2&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt; bits.)--&gt; On the other hand, quantum computers may be able to efficiently solve problems which are not ''practically'' feasible on classical computers.

==Basics==
A classical computer has a [[Computer memory|memory]] made up of [[bit]]s, where each bit is represented by either a one or a zero. A quantum computer, on the other hand, maintains a sequence of [[qubit]]s, which can represent a one, a zero, or any [[quantum superposition]] of those two [[Qubit#Qubit states|qubit states]];&lt;ref name=nielchuan&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Computation and Quantum Information|last1=Nielsen|first1=Michael A.|last2=Chuang|first2=Isaac L.|last3=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1-107-00217-3|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge|pages=|author-link=Michael A. Nielsen|author-link2=Isaac Chuang|title-link=Quantum Computation and Quantum Information (book)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13–16}} a pair of qubits can be in any quantum superposition of 4 states,&lt;ref name=nielchuan /&gt;{{rp|16}} and three qubits in any superposition of 8 states. In general, a quantum computer with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; qubits can be in an arbitrary superposition of up to &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; different states simultaneously.&lt;ref name=nielchuan /&gt;{{rp|17}} (This compares to a normal computer that can only be in ''one'' of these &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; states at any one time).

A quantum computer operates on its qubits using [[quantum gate]]s and [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|measurement]] (which also alters the observed state). An [[quantum algorithm|algorithm]] is composed of a fixed sequence of [[quantum gate|quantum logic gates]] and a problem is encoded by setting the initial values of the qubits, similar to how a classical computer works. The calculation usually ends with a measurement, collapsing the system of qubits into one of the &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; eigenstates, where each qubit is zero or one, decomposing into a classical state. The outcome can, therefore, be at most &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; classical bits of information (or, if the algorithm did not end with a measurement, the result is an unobserved quantum state).

Quantum algorithms are often probabilistic, in that they provide the correct solution only with a certain known probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/ph219/chap5_15.pdf|title=Lecture Notes for Ph219/CS219: Quantum Information Chapter 5|last=Preskill|first=John|date=2015|website=|publisher=|page=12|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the term non-deterministic computing must not be used in that case to mean probabilistic (computing) because the term [[Non-deterministic Turing machine|non-deterministic]] has a different meaning in computer science.

An example of an implementation of qubits of a quantum computer could start with the use of particles with two [[spin (physics)|spin]] states: "down" and "up" (typically written &lt;math&gt;|{\downarrow}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|{\uparrow}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;|0{\rangle}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|1{\rangle}&lt;/math&gt;). This is true because any such system can be mapped onto an effective [[Spin-½|spin-1/2]] system.

== Principles of operation ==
{{more footnotes|section|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- It is unclear how much of the section's content is covered by the source it cites --&gt;
A quantum computer with a given number of qubits is fundamentally different from a classical computer composed of the same number of classical bits. For example, representing the state of an ''n''-qubit system on a classical computer requires the storage of 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; [[Complex number|complex]] coefficients, while to characterize the state of a classical ''n''-bit system it is sufficient to provide the values of the ''n'' bits, that is, only ''n'' numbers. Although this fact may seem to indicate that qubits can hold exponentially more information than their classical counterparts, care must be taken not to overlook the fact that the qubits are only in a probabilistic superposition of all of their states.  This means that when the final state of the qubits is measured, they will only be found in one of the possible configurations they were in before the measurement.  It is generally incorrect to think of a system of qubits as being in one particular state before the measurement. Since the fact that they were in a superposition of states before the measurement was made directly affects the possible outcomes of the computation.

[[File:Quantum computer.svg|thumb|200px|Qubits are made up of controlled particles and the means of control (e.g. devices that trap particles and switch them from one state to another).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Waldner |first = Jean-Baptiste |title = Nanocomputers and Swarm Intelligence |publisher = [[International Society for Technology in Education|ISTE]] |place = London |year = 2007 |page = 157 |isbn = 978-2-7462-1516-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
]]

To better understand this point, consider a classical computer that operates on a three-bit [[Processor register|register]]. If the exact state of the register at a given time is not known, it can be described as a probability distribution over the &lt;math&gt;2^3=8&lt;/math&gt; different three-bit strings &lt;tt&gt;000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110,&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;111&lt;/tt&gt;. If there is no uncertainty over its state, then it is in exactly one of these states with probability 1. However, if it is a [[Probabilistic Turing machine|probabilistic computer]], then there is a possibility of it being in any ''one'' of a number of different states.

The state of a three-qubit quantum computer is similarly described by an [[Eight-dimensional space|eight-dimensional vector]] &lt;math&gt;(a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5,a_6,a_7)&lt;/math&gt; (or a one dimensional vector with
each vector node holding the amplitude and the state as the bit string of qubits). Here, however, the coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; are [[complex number]]s, and it is the sum of the ''squares'' of the coefficients' [[Absolute value#Complex numbers|absolute values]], &lt;math&gt;\sum_i |a_i|^2&lt;/math&gt;, that must equal 1. For each &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, the absolute value squared &lt;math&gt;\left|a_i \right|^2&lt;/math&gt; gives the probability of the system being found in the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th state after a measurement. However, because a complex number encodes not just a magnitude but also a direction in the [[complex plane]], the phase difference between any two coefficients (states) represents a meaningful parameter. This is a fundamental difference between quantum computing and probabilistic classical computing.&lt;ref name="DiVincenzo 1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last=DiVincenzo |first=David P. |title=Quantum Computation |journal=Science |year=1995 |volume=270 |issue=5234 |pages=255–261 |doi= 10.1126/science.270.5234.255 |bibcode = 1995Sci...270..255D |citeseerx=10.1.1.242.2165 }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you measure the three qubits, you will observe a three-bit string. The probability of measuring a given string is the squared magnitude of that string's coefficient (i.e., the probability of measuring &lt;tt&gt;000&lt;/tt&gt; = &lt;math&gt;|a_0|^2&lt;/math&gt;, the probability of measuring &lt;tt&gt;001&lt;/tt&gt; = &lt;math&gt;|a_1|^2&lt;/math&gt;, etc.). Thus, measuring a quantum state described by complex coefficients &lt;math&gt;(a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5,a_6,a_7)&lt;/math&gt; gives the classical probability distribution &lt;math&gt;(|a_0|^2,|a_1|^2,|a_2|^2,|a_3|^2,|a_4|^2,|a_5|^2,|a_6|^2,|a_7|^2)&lt;/math&gt; and we say that the quantum state "collapses" to a classical state as a result of making the measurement.

An eight-dimensional vector can be specified in many different ways depending on what [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] is chosen for the space. The basis of bit strings (e.g., &lt;tt&gt;000&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;001&lt;/tt&gt;, …, &lt;tt&gt;111&lt;/tt&gt;) is known as the computational basis. Other possible bases are [[unit vector|unit-length]], [[orthogonal]] vectors and the eigenvectors of the [[Pauli matrices|Pauli-x operator]]. [[Bra-ket notation|Ket notation]] is often used to make the choice of basis explicit. For example, the state &lt;math&gt;(a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5,a_6,a_7)&lt;/math&gt; in the computational basis can be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;a_0\,|000\rangle + a_1\,|001\rangle + a_2\,|010\rangle + a_3\,|011\rangle + a_4\,|100\rangle + a_5\,|101\rangle + a_6\,|110\rangle + a_7\,|111\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:where, e.g., &lt;math&gt;| 010\rangle = \left(0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The computational basis for a single qubit (two dimensions) is &lt;math&gt;|0\rangle = \left(1,0\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|1\rangle = \left(0,1\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Using the eigenvectors of the Pauli-x operator, a single qubit is &lt;math&gt;|+\rangle = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(1,1\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|-\rangle = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(1,-1\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Unsolved|physics|Is a [[universal quantum computer]] sufficient to [[Algorithmic efficiency|efficiently]] [[Dynamical simulation|simulate]] an arbitrary physical system?}}
While a classical 3-bit state and a quantum 3-qubit state are each eight-dimensional [[coordinate vector|vectors]], they are manipulated quite differently for classical or quantum computation. For computing in either case, the system must be initialized, for example into the all-zeros string, &lt;math&gt;|000\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to the vector (1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0). In classical randomized computation, the system evolves according to the application of [[Stochastic matrix|stochastic matrices]], which preserve that the probabilities add up to one (i.e., preserve the [[Taxicab geometry|L1 norm]]). In quantum computation, on the other hand, allowed operations are [[unitary matrix|unitary matrices]], which are effectively rotations (they preserve that the sum of the squares add up to one, the [[Euclidean distance|Euclidean or L2 norm]]). (Exactly what unitaries can be applied depend on the physics of the quantum device.) Consequently, since rotations can be undone by rotating backward, quantum computations are [[Reversible computing|reversible]]. (Technically, quantum operations can be probabilistic combinations of unitaries, so quantum computation really does generalize classical computation. See [[quantum circuit]] for a more precise formulation.)

Finally, upon termination of the algorithm, the result needs to be read off. In the case of a classical computer, we ''sample'' from the [[probability distribution]] on the three-bit register to obtain one definite three-bit string, say 000. Quantum mechanically, one ''[[Measurement in quantum mechanics|measures]]'' the three-qubit state, which is equivalent to collapsing the quantum state down to a classical distribution (with the coefficients in the classical state being the squared magnitudes of the coefficients for the quantum state, as described above), followed by sampling from that distribution. This destroys the original quantum state. Many algorithms will only give the correct answer with a certain probability. However, by repeatedly initializing, running and measuring the quantum computer's results, the probability of getting the correct answer can be increased. In contrast, [[counterfactual quantum computation]] allows the correct answer to be inferred when the quantum computer is not actually running in a technical sense, though earlier initialization and frequent measurements are part of the counterfactual computation protocol.

For more details on the sequences of operations used for various [[quantum algorithm]]s, see [[universal quantum computer]], [[Shor's algorithm]], [[Grover's algorithm]], [[Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm]], [[amplitude amplification]], [[quantum Fourier transform]], [[quantum gate]], [[Adiabatic quantum computation|quantum adiabatic algorithm]] and [[quantum error correction]].

=== Cryptography ===
[[Integer factorization]], which underpins the security of [[public key cryptography|public key cryptographic]] systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few [[prime number]]s (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lenstra |first=Arjen K. |url=http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |title=Integer Factoring |journal=Designs, Codes and Cryptography |volume=19 |pages=101–128 |year=2000 |doi=10.1023/A:1008397921377 |issue=2/3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410234239/http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, a quantum computer could efficiently solve this problem using [[Shor's algorithm]] to find its factors. This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the [[cryptography|cryptographic]] systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a [[polynomial time]] (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular [[Asymmetric Algorithms|public key ciphers]] are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the [[discrete logarithm]] problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular, the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]], [[Diffie–Hellman]], and [[elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman]] algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.

However, [[Post-quantum cryptography|other cryptographic algorithms]] do not appear to be broken by those algorithms.&lt;ref name="pqcrypto_survey"&gt;Daniel J.

Quantum-based cryptographic systems could ,therefore, be more secure than traditional systems against quantum hacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/quantum-computing-explained|title=What are quantum computers and how do they work?

=== Quantum search ===

Besides factorization and discrete logarithms, quantum algorithms offering a more than polynomial speedup over the best known classical algorithm have been found for several problems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.nist.gov/quantum/zoo/ Quantum Algorithm Zoo] – Stephen Jordan's Homepage&lt;/ref&gt; including the simulation of quantum physical processes from chemistry and solid state physics, the approximation of [[Jones polynomial]]s, and solving [[Pell's equation]]. No mathematical proof has been found that shows that an equally fast classical algorithm cannot be discovered, although this is considered unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Jon Schiller, Phd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l217ma2sWkoC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=Mathematical%20proof&amp;f=false 
|title=Quantum Computers|isbn=9781439243497 
|date=2009-06-19 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some problems, quantum computers offer a polynomial speedup. The most well-known example of this is ''quantum database search'', which can be solved by [[Grover's algorithm]] using quadratically fewer queries to the database than that are required by classical algorithms. In this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal, it has been shown that Grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups. Several other examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems have subsequently been discovered, such as for finding collisions in two-to-one functions and evaluating NAND trees.

Problems that can be addressed with [[Grover's algorithm]] have the following properties:
#There is no searchable structure in the collection of possible answers,
#The number of possible answers to check is the same as the number of inputs to the algorithm, and
#There exists a boolean function which evaluates each input and determines whether it is the correct answer

For problems with all these properties, the running time of [[Grover's algorithm]] on a quantum computer will scale as the square root of the number of inputs (or elements in the database), as opposed to the linear scaling of classical algorithms. A general class of problems to which [[Grover's algorithm]] can be applied &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = quant-ph/0504012|last1 = Ambainis|first1 = Andris|title = Quantum search algorithms|year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Boolean satisfiability problem]]. In this instance, the ''database'' through which the algorithm is iterating is that of all possible answers. An example (and possible) application of this is a [[Password cracking|password cracker]] that attempts to guess the password or secret key for an [[encryption|encrypted]] file or system. [[Symmetric-key algorithm|Symmetric ciphers]] such as [[Triple DES]] and [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] are particularly vulnerable to this kind of attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1804.00200|doi=10.14569/IJACSA.2018.090354 |title=The Impact of Quantum Computing on Present Cryptography |journal=International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications |volume=9 |issue=3 |date=March 2018 |last1=Mavroeidis |first1=Vasileios |last2=Vishi |first2=Kamer |last3=d |first3=Mateusz |last4=Jøsang |first4=Audun }}&lt;/ref&gt; This application of quantum computing is a major interest of government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-seeks-to-build-quantum-computer-that-could-crack-most-types-of-encryption/2014/01/02/8fff297e-7195-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html?hpid=z1 |title=NSA seeks to build quantum computer that could crack most types of encryption |first1=Steven |last1=Rich |first2=Barton |last2=Gellman |date=2014-02-01 |newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quantum simulation ===
Since chemistry and nanotechnology rely on understanding quantum systems, and such systems are impossible to simulate in an efficient manner classically, many believe [[Quantum simulator|quantum simulation]] will be one of the most important applications of quantum computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/02/72734 |title=The Father of Quantum Computing |journal=Wired |first=Quinn |last=Norton |date=2007-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum simulation could also be used to simulate the behavior of atoms and particles at unusual conditions such as the reactions inside a [[collider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.edu/ias-letter/ambainis-quantum-computing |title=What Can We Do with a Quantum Computer? |first=Andris |last=Ambainis |date=Spring 2014 |publisher=Institute for Advanced Study}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quantum annealing and adiabatic optimisation ===
[[Adiabatic quantum computation]] relies on the adiabatic theorem to undertake calculations. A system is placed in the ground state for a simple Hamiltonian, which is slowly evolved to a more complicated Hamiltonian whose ground state represents the solution to the problem in question. The adiabatic theorem states that if the evolution is slow enough the system will stay in its ground state at all times through the process.

=== Solving linear equations ===
The [[Quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations]] or "HHL Algorithm", named after its discoverers Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd, is expected to provide speedup over classical counterparts.&lt;ref name="Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations by Harrow et al."&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 0811.3171|last1 = Ambainis|first1 = Andris|last2 = Hassidim|first2 = Avinatan|last3 = Lloyd|first3 = Seth|title = Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations|journal = Physical Review Letters|volume = 103|issue = 15|pages = 150502|year = 2008|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.150502|pmid = 19905613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Obstacles ==
There are a number of technical challenges in building a large-scale quantum computer, and thus far quantum computers have yet to solve a problem faster than a classical computer. [[David P. DiVincenzo|David DiVincenzo]], of IBM, listed the following [[DiVincenzo's criteria|requirements]] for a practical quantum computer:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=quant-ph/0002077|title=The Physical Implementation of Quantum Computation|last=DiVincenzo |first=David P.|date=2000-04-13|doi=10.1002/1521-3978(200009)48:9/11&lt;771::AID-PROP771&gt;3.0.CO;2-E|volume=48|issue=9–11|journal=Fortschritte der Physik|pages=771–783|bibcode=2000ForPh..48..771D}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*scalable physically to increase the number of qubits;
*qubits that can be initialized to arbitrary values;
*quantum gates that are faster than [[decoherence]] time;
*universal gate set;
*qubits that can be read easily.

=== Quantum decoherence ===
{{Main|Quantum decoherence}}

One of the greatest challenges is controlling or removing [[quantum decoherence]]. This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (for [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[MRI]] technology, also called the ''dephasing time''), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature.&lt;ref name="DiVincenzo 1995" /&gt; Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvins in order to prevent significant decoherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Nicola|title=Computing: The quantum company|journal=Nature|date=19 June 2013|volume=498|issue=7454|pages=286–288|doi=10.1038/498286a|pmid=23783610|bibcode=2013Natur.498..286J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as maintaining the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Amy|first1=Matthew|last2=Matteo|first2=Olivia|last3=Gheorghiu|first3=Vlad|last4=Mosca|first4=Michele|last5=Parent|first5=Alex|last6=Schanck|first6=John|title=Estimating the cost of generic quantum pre-image attacks on SHA-2 and SHA-3|date=November 30, 2016|eprint=1603.09383|class=quant-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical [[pulse shaping]]. Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time, hence any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time.

As described in the [[Quantum threshold theorem]], if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use quantum error correction to suppress errors and decoherence. This allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them. An often cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, assuming the noise is depolarizing.

Meeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between ''L'' and ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''L'' is the number of qubits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of ''L''. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; bits without error correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation Really Possible? |last=Dyakonov |first=M. I. |date=2006-10-14 |pages=4–18 |journal=Future Trends in Microelectronics. Up the Nano Creek |editor1=S. Luryi |editor2=J. Xu |editor3=A. Zaslavsky | arxiv=quant-ph/0610117|bibcode=2006quant.ph.10117D }}&lt;/ref&gt; With error correction, the figure would rise to about 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; bits. Computation time is about ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or about 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; steps and at 1&amp;nbsp;MHz, about 10 seconds.

A very different approach to the stability-decoherence problem is to create a [[topological quantum computer]] with [[anyon]]s, quasi-particles used as threads and relying on [[braid theory]] to form stable logic gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Quantum computing models ===
There are a number of quantum computing models, distinguished by the basic elements in which the computation is decomposed. The four main models of practical importance are:
* [[quantum circuit|Quantum gate array]] (computation decomposed into a sequence of few-qubit [[quantum gate]]s)
* [[One-way quantum computer]] (computation decomposed into a sequence of one-qubit measurements applied to a highly entangled initial state or [[cluster state]])
* [[Adiabatic quantum computation|Adiabatic quantum computer]], based on [[quantum annealing]] (computation decomposed into a slow continuous transformation of an initial [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] into a final Hamiltonian, whose ground states contain the solution)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |first=A. |last=Das |first2=B.

The [[quantum Turing machine]] is theoretically important but the direct implementation of this model is not pursued. All four models of computation have been shown to be equivalent; each can simulate the other with no more than polynomial overhead.

=== Physical realizations ===
For physically implementing a quantum computer, many different candidates are being pursued, among them (distinguished by the physical system used to realize the qubits):

A large number of candidates demonstrates that the topic, in spite of rapid progress, is still in its infancy. There is also a vast amount of flexibility.

=== Timeline ===
{{Main|Timeline of quantum computing}}

In 1959 [[Richard Feynman]] in his lecture "[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]" states the possibility of using quantum effects for computation.

In 1980 [[Paul Benioff]] described quantum mechanical Hamiltonian models of computers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Benioff | first1=Paul | title = The computer as a physical system: A microscopic quantum mechanical Hamiltonian model of computers as represented by Turing machines | journal =  Journal of Statistical Physics |volume= 22 |  issue = 5 | pages =563–591 | year = 1980 | doi=10.1007/bf01011339|bibcode = 1980JSP....22..563B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Russian mathematician [[Yuri Manin]] motivated the development of quantum computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Manin |first=Yu I |year=1980 |title=Vychislimoe i nevychislimoe |trans-title=Computable and Noncomputable |language=ru |work=Sov.Radio |pp=13–15 |url= http://publ.lib.ru/ARCHIVES/M/MANIN_Yuriy_Ivanovich/Manin_Yu.I._Vychislimoe_i_nevychislimoe.(1980).%5Bdjv%5D.zip |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130510173823/http://publ.lib.ru/ARCHIVES/M/MANIN_Yuriy_Ivanovich/Manin_Yu.I._Vychislimoe_i_nevychislimoe.%281980%29.%5Bdjv%5D.zip |archive-date=May 10, 2013 |access-date=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, at a conference co-organized by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and IBM, physicist [[Richard Feynman]] urged the world to build a quantum computer. He said, "Nature isn't classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you'd better make it quantum mechanical, and by golly, it's a wonderful problem because it doesn't look so easy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gil|first1=Dario|title=The Dawn of Quantum Computing is Upon Us|url=https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/2016/05/the-quantum-age-of-computing-is-here/|accessdate=May 4, 2016|date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, [[BB84]] is published, the world's first [[quantum cryptography protocol]] by IBM scientists [[Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist)|Charles Bennett]] and [[Gilles Brassard]].

In 1993, an international group of six scientists, including Charles Bennett, showed that perfect [[quantum teleportation]] is possible&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bennett,|first1=C. H.|title=Teleporting an unknown quantum state via dual classical and Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen channels|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=29 March 1993|volume=70|issue=13|pages=1895–1899|url=http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-bennetc/BBCJPW.pdf|bibcode=1993PhRvL..70.1895B|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.70.1895|pmid=10053414}}&lt;/ref&gt; in principle, but only if the original is destroyed.

In 1994 [[Peter Shor]], at AT&amp;amp;T's [[Bell Labs]] discovered an important quantum algorithm, which allows a quantum computer to factor large integers exponentially much faster than the best known classical algorithm. [[Shor's algorithm]] can theoretically break many of the [[Public-key cryptography|public-key cryptosystem]]s in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ekert |first=Artur |last2=Josza |first2=Richard |title=Quantum computation and Shor's factoring algorithm |journal=Rev. Mod. Phys. |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=733–753 |year=1996 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.68.733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its invention sparked a tremendous interest in quantum computers.

In 1996, The [[DiVincenzo's criteria]] are published which is a list of conditions that are necessary for constructing a quantum computer proposed by the theoretical physicist [[David P. DiVincenzo]] in his 2000 paper "The Physical Implementation of Quantum Computation".

In 2001, researchers demonstrated [[Shor's algorithm]] to factor 15 using a 7-qubit NMR computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/414883a|title=Experimental realization of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm using nuclear magnetic resonance|year=2001|last1=Vandersypen|first1=Lieven M.

In 2005, researchers at the [[University of Michigan]] built a [[semiconductor chip]] [[ion trap]]. Such devices from standard [[photolithography|lithography]] may point the way to scalable quantum computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.umich.edu/news/index.html?Releases/2005/Dec05/r121205b |title= U-M develops scalable and mass-producible quantum computer chip |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=2006-11-17 |date=2005-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, researchers at [[Yale University]] created the first solid-state quantum processor. The two-[[qubit]] superconducting chip had artificial atom qubits made of a billion [[aluminum]] [[atom]]s that acted like a single atom that could occupy two states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/nature08121.pdf |title= Demonstration of two-qubit algorithms with a superconducting quantum processor |accessdate=2009-07-02 |last=DiCarlo |first=L. |last2=Chow |first2=J.

A team at the [[University of Bristol]] also created a [[silicon]] chip based on [[quantum optics]], able to run [[Shor's algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17736-codebreaking-quantum-algorithm-run-on-a-silicon-chip.html |title= Code-breaking quantum algorithm runs on a silicon chip |accessdate=2009-10-14 |work=New Scientist |date=2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further developments were made in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= New Trends in Quantum Computation | url=http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/itp/conf/simons-qcomputation2/program.html |work=Simons Conference on New Trends in Quantum Computation 2010: Program |publisher=C.N.

In April 2011, a team of scientists from Australia and Japan made a breakthrough in [[quantum teleportation]]. They successfully transferred a complex set of quantum data with full transmission integrity, without affecting the qubits' superpositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unsw.edu.au/news/pad/articles/2011/apr/Quantum_teleport_paper.html |title=Quantum teleporter breakthrough |publisher=University of New South Wales |date=2011-04-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110418200747/http://www.unsw.edu.au/news/pad/articles/2011/apr/Quantum_teleport_paper.html |archivedate=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lai |first=Richard | url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/04/18/first-light-wave-quantum-teleportation-achieved-opens-door-to-u/ |title=First light wave quantum teleportation achieved, opens door to ultra fast data transmission |publisher=Engadget |date=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[D-Wave Systems]] announced the first commercial quantum annealer, the D-Wave One, claiming a 128 qubit processor. On May 25, 2011, [[Lockheed Martin]] agreed to purchase a D-Wave One system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dwavesys.com/en/pressreleases.html#lm_2011 |title= D-Wave Systems sells its first Quantum Computing System to Lockheed Martin Corporation |accessdate=2011-05-30 |date=2011-05-25 |publisher=D-Wave}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lockheed and the University of Southern California (USC) will house the D-Wave One at the newly formed USC Lockheed Martin Quantum Computing Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.viterbi.usc.edu/news/news/2011/operational-quantum-computing334119.htm |title= Operational Quantum Computing Center Established at USC |accessdate=2011-12-06 |date=2011-10-29 |publisher=University of Southern California}}&lt;/ref&gt; D-Wave's engineers designed the chips with an empirical approach, focusing on solving particular problems.

== Relation to computational complexity theory ==
{{Main|Quantum complexity theory}}

[[File:BQP complexity class diagram.svg|thumb|The suspected relationship of BQP to other problem spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The class of problems that can be efficiently solved by quantum computers is called [[BQP]], for "bounded error, quantum, polynomial time". Quantum computers only run [[probabilistic algorithm]]s, so BQP on quantum computers is the counterpart of [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]] ("bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time") on classical computers. It is defined as the set of problems solvable with a polynomial-time algorithm, whose probability of error is bounded away from one half.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; A quantum computer is said to "solve" a problem if, for every instance, its answer will be right with high probability. If that solution runs in polynomial time, then that problem is in BQP.

BQP is contained in the complexity class ''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'' (or more precisely in the associated class of decision problems ''P&lt;sup&gt;#P&lt;/sup&gt;''),&lt;ref name=BernVazi&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Ethan |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh |doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921 |title=Quantum Complexity Theory |year=1997 |pages=1411–1473 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.144.7852 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a subclass of [[PSPACE]].

BQP is suspected to be disjoint from [[NP-complete]] and a strict superset of [[P (complexity)|P]], but that is not known. Both [[integer factorization]] and [[discrete logarithm problem|discrete log]] are in BQP. Both of these problems are NP problems suspected to be outside BPP, and hence outside P. Both are suspected to not be NP-complete. There is a common misconception that quantum computers can solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. That is not known to be true, and is generally suspected to be false.&lt;ref name=BernVazi /&gt;

The capacity of a quantum computer to accelerate classical algorithms has rigid limits—upper bounds of quantum computation's complexity. The overwhelming part of classical calculations cannot be accelerated on a quantum computer.&lt;ref name=Ozhigov1&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ozhigov |first1=Yuri |title=Quantum Computers Speed Up Classical with Probability Zero |year=1999 |pages=1707–1714 |volume=10 |journal=Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals |arxiv=quant-ph/9803064 |bibcode = 1998quant.ph..3064O |doi=10.1016/S0960-0779(98)00226-4 |issue=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar fact takes place for particular computational tasks, like the search problem, for which [[Grover's algorithm]] is optimal.&lt;ref name=Ozhigov2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ozhigov |first1=Yuri |title=Lower Bounds of Quantum Search for Extreme Point |year=1999 |pages=2165–2172 |volume=A455 |journal=Proceedings of the London Royal Society |arxiv=quant-ph/9806001 |bibcode = 1999RSPSA.455.2165O |doi = 10.1098/rspa.1999.0397 |issue=1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[De Broglie–Bohm theory|Bohmian Mechanics]] is a non-local hidden variable interpretation of quantum mechanics. It has been shown that a non-local hidden variable quantum computer could implement a search of an N-item database at most in &lt;math&gt;O(\sqrt[3]{N})&lt;/math&gt; steps. This is slightly faster than the &lt;math&gt;O(\sqrt{N})&lt;/math&gt; steps taken by [[Grover's algorithm]]. Neither search method will allow quantum computers to solve [[NP-completeness|NP-Complete]] problems in polynomial time.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/qchvpra.pdf|title=Quantum Computing and Hidden Variables|last=Aaronson|first=Scott|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although quantum computers may be faster than classical computers for some problem types, those described above cannot solve any problem that classical computers cannot already solve. A [[Turing machine]] can simulate &lt;!-- add mention about [[Quantum Virtual Machines]] which can simulate quantum computer on classical one --&gt;these quantum computers, so such a quantum computer could never solve an [[undecidable problem]] like the [[halting problem]]. The existence of "standard" quantum computers does not disprove the [[Church–Turing thesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that theories of [[quantum gravity]], such as [[M-theory]] or [[loop quantum gravity]], may allow even faster computers to be built. Currently, ''defining'' computation in such theories is an open problem due to the ''[[problem of time]]'', i.e., there currently exists no obvious way to describe what it means for an observer to submit input to a computer and later receive output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[Scott Aaronson]]|title=NP-complete Problems and Physical Reality|journal=ACM SIGACT News, March|volume=2005|arxiv=quant-ph/0502072|year=2005|bibcode=2005quant.ph..2072A}} See section 7 "Quantum Gravity": "[…] to anyone who wants
a test or benchmark for a favorite quantum gravity theory,[author's footnote: That is, one without all the bother of making numerical predictions and comparing them to observation] let me humbly propose the following: ''can you define Quantum Gravity Polynomial-Time?'' […] until we can say what it means for a 'user' to specify an 'input' and
‘later' receive an 'output'—''there is no such thing as computation, not even theoretically.''" (emphasis in original)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Radiological Research Accelerator Facility''' ('''RARAF'''),&lt;ref name="RARAFweb"&gt;http://www.raraf.org&lt;/ref&gt; located on the [[Columbia University]] [[Nevis Laboratories]] campus in [[Irvington, New York|Irvington]], [[New York (state)|New York]] is a [[nibib|National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering]] biotechnology resource center (P41)&lt;ref name="p41"&gt;http://www.nibib.nih.gov/Research/ResourceCenters/ListState&lt;/ref&gt; specializing in [[microbeam]] technology. 
The facility is currently built around a 5MV Singletron, a [[particle accelerator]] similar to a [[Van de Graaff generator|Van de Graaff]].

The RARAF microbeam can produce with high accuracy and precision:
* 70-120 keV/μm [[alpha particles]]
* 8-25 keV/μm [[protons]]
* 0.6 μm diameter [[electrostatic lens|focused]] beam spot
* 10,000 cells/hour throughput

==History==

RARAF was conceived by Victor P. Bond and Harald H. Rossi in the late 1960s . Their aim was to provide a source of monoenergetic [[neutrons]] designed and operated specifically for studies in [[radiation biology]], [[dosimetry]], and microdosimetry. The facility was built around the 4 MV [[Van de Graaff generator|Van de Graaff]] [[particle accelerator]] that originally served as the injector for the [[Cosmotron]], a 2 [[GeV]] accelerator operated at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] (BNL) in the 1950s and 1960s.

RARAF operated at BNL from 1967 until 1980, when it was dismantled to make room for the [[ISABELLE|ISABELLE project]], a very large accelerator which was never completed. A new site for RARAF was found at the [[Nevis Laboratories]] of [[Columbia University]] where its [[cyclotron]] was being disassembled. The [[U.S. Department of Energy]] provided funds to move RARAF to Nevis Laboratories and reassemble it in a new multi-level facility constructed within the cyclotron building. The new RARAF has been routinely operating for research since mid-1984.

RARAF was one of the first three [[microbeam]] facilities&lt;ref name="Michael94"&gt;B.D. Michael, M. Folkard and K.M. Prise. Meeting Report: Microbeam Probes of Cellular Radiation Response, 4th L.H. Gray Workshop, 8–10 July 1993. ''Int. J. Radiat. Biol.'' '''65''':503-508 (1994). {{PMID|7908938}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be built, and it is the only original microbeam facility still in operation.

In 2006 the [[Van de Graaff generator|Van de Graaff]] was replaced by a 5 MV Singletron from High Voltage Engineering Europa (HVEE) in the [[Netherlands]].

==Microbeam Development==
As an NIBIB biotechnology resource center, RARAF is dedicated to developing and improving microbeam technologies. Developments focus on adding and improving imaging techniques to the existing microbeam. Neutron and x-ray microbeams are also in development. Some examples of microbeam developments are listed below.

===Microbeam lens===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:RARAF Quadrupole Triplet.jpg|thumb| Quadrupole Triplet Electrostatic Lens]] --&gt;In order to focus charged particles in the RARAF microbeam, an [[electrostatic lens]] consisting of six [[quadrupoles|quadrupole]] arranged in two triplets with each successive quadrupole rotated by 90° around its axis, is used. Each quadrupole triplet consists of 4 ceramic rods on which gold electrodes were plated. This design ensures alignment of the three quadrupoles in the triplet and allows a small pole-gap and better focusing properties.

===Subcellular targeting===
Due to the nature of the RARAF microbeam, sub-cellular targets such as the cell nucleus or the cell cytoplasm have been possible for years. With a sub-micrometre diameter beam routinely available, additional targets within cellular systems are accessible. For instance, preliminary radiation experiments that target mitochondria have been conducted on small airway epithelial cells.&lt;ref name="RARAFweb" /&gt;

===Point and shoot microbeam===
During microbeam irradiation, cells to be irradiated are moved to the beam position using a high-speed high-resolution three-axis piezo-electric stage.&lt;ref name="RARAFjournal"&gt;Bigelow A, Garty G, Funayama T, Randers-Pehrson G, Brenner D, Geard C. Expanding the question-answering potential of single-cell microbeams at RARAF, USA. ''J Radiat Res (Tokyo).'' '''50 Suppl A''':A21-8 (2009). {{PMID|19346682}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to further reduce targeting time, and making use of the fact that a focused microbeam, unlike a collimated one, is not restricted to a single location on the accelerator exit window, we have implemented a magnetic-coil-based fast deflector, placed between the two quadrupole triplets, that allows deflecting the beam to any position in the field of view of the microscope used to observe the cells during irradiation. Moving the beam to the cell position magnetically can be performed much faster than moving the stage. The deflector used in this system can move the beam to as many as 1000 separate locations per second—more than 5 times the speed of movement of the stage—dramatically reducing the irradiation time.

===X-ray microbeam===
The RARAF microbeam is adding an x-ray microbeam using [[characteristic x-ray|characteristic Kα x rays]] from Ti. The x rays will be generated using an electrostatic lens system to focus protons onto a thick Ti target. The x rays generated are demagnified using a zone plate. By using the already focused proton microbeam to generate characteristic x rays, it is possible to obtain a nearly monochromatic x-ray beam (very low bremsstrahlung yield) and a reasonably small x-ray source (~20&amp;nbsp;µm diameter), reducing the requirements on the zone plate.

There are considerable benefits in using soft x-ray microbeams for both mechanistic and risk estimation end-points. The higher spatial resolution achievable with modern state-of-the-art x-ray optics elements combined with the localized damage produced by the absorption of low energy photons (~1 keV) represents a unique tool to investigate the radio-sensitivity of sub-cellular and eventually sub-nuclear targets. Also, since low-energy x rays undergo very little scattering, by using x rays with an energy of ~5 keV it will be possible to irradiate with micrometre precision individual cells and/or parts of cells up to a few hundred micrometres deep inside a tissue sample in order to investigate the relevance of effects such as the bystander effect in 3-D structured cell systems.

==Microbeam experiments==
RARAF is also a user facility for biologists interested in performing microbeam studies. The prominent theme of research undertaken using the RARAF microbeam is damage signal transduction, both within cells and between cells, which is of interest due in part to the discovery of the [[Bystander effect (radiobiology)|radiation-induced bystander effect]]. Early inter-cellular signal transduction studies were done with cells plated in 2D monolayers. More recently due to the significance of the extracellular environment and technological developments, studies involving 3D tissue systems,&lt;ref name="Belyakov05"&gt;Belyakov OV ''et al''. Biological effects in unirradiated human tissue induced by radiation damage up to 1 mm away. ''PNAS'' '''102''':14203-8 (2005). {{PMID|1612670}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedelnikova07"&gt;Sedelnikova OA ''et al''. DNA double-strand breaks form in bystander cells after microbeam irradiation of three-dimensional human tissue models. '"Cancer Res.'' '''67''':4295-302 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; including living organisms,&lt;ref name="Bertucci09"&gt;Bertucci A, Pocock RD, Randers-Pehrson G, and Brenner DJ. Microbeam irradiation of the C. elegans nematode. ''J. Radiat. Res.'' '''50 Suppl A.''':A49-54 (2009). {{PMID|19346684}}&lt;/ref&gt; have become more common.

==Applications of Microfluidics==
RARAF is developing various [[microfluidic]] devices which add to the irradiation capabilities of the facility. The precision control and manipulation of fluids and biological materials afforded by microfluidics are ideal to interface with the microbeam. Additional microfluidic systems beyond those listed here are currently under development.

===Flow and Shoot===
The Flow and Shoot microbeam system allows for controlled transport of cells through a microfluidic channel which intersects with the point and shoot microbeam.&lt;ref name="Garty11"&gt;Garty G ''et al''. Design of a novel flow-and-shoot microbeam. ''Radiat Prot Dosimetry'' '''143(2-4)''':344-348 (2011). {{PMC|3108275}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high speed camera allows for dynamic targeting of the flowing cells with flow rates of 1–10&amp;nbsp;mm/s, allowing for total throughput upwards of 100,000 cells per hour.

=== Optofluidic Cell Manipulation===
An [[optoelectronic tweezer]] platform has been interfaced with the RARAF microbeam.&lt;ref name="Grad13"&gt;Grad M ''et al''. Optofluidic cell manipulation for a biological microbeam. ''Rev. Sci. Instrum.'' '''84''':014301 (2013). {{doi|10.1063/1.4774043}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows precision manipulation of cell position before, during, and after irradiation.

=== ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' immobilization===
RARAF has implemented a microfluidic platform for the immobilization of ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' during microbeam irradiation.&lt;ref name="Buonanno13"&gt;Buonanno M ''et al''. Microbeam irradiation of C. elegans nematode in microfluidic channels. '' Radiation and environmental biophysics '' 1-7 (2013). {{doi|10.1007/s00411-013-0485-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device avoids the use of anesthetics that might interfere with normal physiological processes by capturing the ''C. elegans'' worms in tapered microfluidic channels. It is possible to target specific regions of interest within ''C. elegans'' using this technology.

==Other Technologies==
Broad beam irradiations are also possible.  Particles with [[linear energy transfer]] (LET) between 10 and 200 keV/μm are available utilizing beams of protons, deuterons, helium-3, and helium-4 ions. Additionally, energetic and [[thermal neutrons]] and [[x rays]] can be used in broad beam irradiations.

==Training Scientists==
RARAF has trained scientists at all levels: high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, post docs, and senior scientists. The lab estimates that about 45 scientists have received training in microbeam physics and or biology in the past 5 years. 
 
RARAF is an active participant in the Columbia University Research Experience for Undergraduates program.

In addition, RARAF has become a ''de facto'' training center for developers of new microbeams. A [http://www.raraf.org/educationalmaterials.htm virtual microbeam training course], complete with videos and handouts, is also available online.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47096">A '''renewable resource''' is a [[natural resource]] which replenishes to overcome [[resource depletion]] caused by usage and consumption, either through biological reproduction or other naturally recurring processes in a finite amount of time in a human time scale. Renewable resources are a part of Earth's natural environment and the largest components of its [[Ecosphere (ecology)|ecosphere]]. A positive life cycle assessment is a key indicator of a resource's sustainability.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Management for a Small Planet" by Jean Garner Stead and W. Edward Stead, M.E.

Definitions of renewable resources may also include agricultural production, as in [[sustainable agriculture]] and to an extent [[water resources]].&lt;ref name="What are Renewable Resources"&gt;[http://www.oas.org/dsd/publications/Unit/oea79e/ch05.htm What are “Renewable Resources”?], by A.

==Air, food and water==

===Water resources===

{{Main article|Water resources}}

[[Water]] can be considered a ''renewable'' material when carefully controlled usage, treatment, and release are followed. If not, it would become a non-renewable resource at that location. For example, [[groundwater]] is usually removed from an [[aquifer]] at a rate much greater than its very slow natural recharge, and so groundwater is considered non-renewable. Removal of water from the pore spaces may cause permanent compaction ([[subsidence]]) that cannot be renewed. 97.5% of the water on the Earth is salt water, and 3% is [[fresh water]]; slightly over two thirds of this is frozen in [[glacier]]s and [[Polar climate|polar]] [[ice cap]]s.&lt;ref name="USGS dist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/waterdistribution.html|title=Earth's water distribution|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining unfrozen freshwater is found mainly as groundwater, with only a small fraction (0.008%) present above ground or in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Scientific Facts on Water: State of the Resource| publisher=GreenFacts Website | accessdate=2008-01-31 | url= http://www.greenfacts.org/en/water-resources/index.htm#2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Water pollution]] is one of the main concerns regarding water resources. It is estimated that 22% of worldwide water is used in industry.&lt;ref name="WBCSD Water Facts &amp; Trends"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=MTYyNTA |title=WBCSD Water Facts &amp; Trends |date= |accessdate=2009-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301011840/http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=MTYyNTA |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Major industrial users include hydroelectric dams, [[Electricity generation#Other generation methods|thermoelectric power plants]] (which use water for cooling), [[ore]] and [[Petroleum|oil]] refineries (which use water in chemical processes) and manufacturing plants (which use water as a solvent).

[[Desalination]] of seawater is considered a renewable source of water, although reducing its dependence on fossil fuel energy is needed for it to be fully renewable.&lt;ref name=LowCDesal&gt;{{cite web | last=Lienhard | first=John H. | last2=Thiel | first2=Gregory P. | last3=Warsinger | first3=David M. | last4=Banchik | first4=Leonardo D. | title=Low Carbon Desalination: Status and Research, Development, and Demonstration Needs, Report of a workshop conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in association with the Global Clean Water Desalination Alliance | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology | date=2016-12-08 | url=http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/105755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non agricultural food===
[[File:Alaska wild berries.jpg|thumb|right|Alaska wild "berries" from the [[Innoko National Wildlife Refuge]] - Renewable Resources]]
Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212568/food Encyclopædia Britannica definition]&lt;/ref&gt; Most food has its origin in renewable resources. Food is obtained directly from plants and animals.

Hunting may not be the first source of meat in the modernised world, but it is still an important and essential source for many rural and remote groups. It is also the sole source of feeding for wild carnivores.&lt;ref&gt;Mammals: Carnivores. Duane E. Ullrey. Encyclopedia of Animal Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable agriculture===
{{main article|Sustainable agriculture}}
The phrase [[sustainable agriculture]] was coined by Australian agricultural scientist [[Gordon McClymont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rural Science Graduates Association |year=2002 |url=http://agbu.une.edu.au/~aaabg/rsga/im.html |title={{sic|In Memo|rium|hide=y|expected=In Memoriam}}&amp;nbsp;— Former Staff and Students of Rural Science at UNE |publisher=[[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] |accessdate=21 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606220152/http://agbu.une.edu.au/~aaabg/rsga/im.html |archivedate=6 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been defined as "an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a site-specific application that will last over the long term".&lt;ref&gt;Gold, M. (July 2009). [http://www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/pubs/agnic/susag.shtml What is Sustainable Agriculture?]. United States Department of Agriculture, Alternative Farming Systems Information Center.&lt;/ref&gt; Expansion of agricultural land reduces [[biodiversity]] and contributes to [[deforestation]]. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations estimates that in coming decades, cropland will continue to be lost to industrial and urban development, along with reclamation of wetlands, and conversion of forest to cultivation, resulting in the [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] and increased [[soil erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y4252e/y4252e14.htm |title=FAO World Agriculture towards 2015/2030 |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |year=2003 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Polyculture.JPG|thumb|250px|Polyculture practices in [[Andhra Pradesh]]]]
Although [[air]] and [[sunlight]] are available everywhere on [[Earth]], [[Agriculture|crops]] also depend on [[soil]] [[nutrients]] and the availability of [[water resources|water]]. [[Monoculture]] is a method of growing only one crop at a time in a given field, which can damage land and cause it to become either unusable or suffer from reduced [[Crop yield|yields]]. Monoculture can also cause the build-up of [[pathogen]]s and pests that target one specific species. The [[Great Irish Famine|Great Irish Famine (1845–1849)]] is a well-known example of the dangers of monoculture.

[[Crop rotation]] and [[shifting cultivation|long-term crop rotations]] confer the replenishment of nitrogen through the use of [[green manure]] in sequence with cereals and other crops, and can improve [[soil structure]] and [[fertility (soil)|fertility]] by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants. Other methods to combat lost soil nutrients are returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands (returning lost nutrients indefinitely) such as the [[Flooding of the Nile]], the long-term use of [[biochar]], and use of crop and livestock [[landrace]]s that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests, drought, or lack of nutrients.

Agricultural practices are the single greatest contributor to the global increase in [[Erosion|soil erosion]] rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|authors=Committee on 21st Century Systems Agriculture|title=Toward Sustainable Agricultural Systems in the 21st Century|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-309-14896-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wdm4qMW1azgC&amp;pg=PT88}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that "more than a thousand million tonnes of southern Africa's soil are eroded every year. Experts predict that crop yields will be halved within thirty to fifty years if erosion continues at present rates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Musokotwane Environment Resource Centre for Southern Africa CEP Factsheet |url=http://www.sardc.net/imercsa/Programs/CEP/Pubs/CEPFS/CEPFS01.htm |accessdate=2013-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213002938/http://www.sardc.net/imercsa/Programs/CEP/Pubs/CEPFS/CEPFS01.htm |archivedate=2013-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dust Bowl]] phenomenon in the 1930s was caused by severe [[drought]] combined with farming methods that did not include crop rotation, fallow fields, [[cover crop]]s, soil terracing and wind-breaking trees to prevent [[Aeolian processes|wind erosion]].&lt;ref name=drought&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tillage]] of agricultural lands is one of the primary contributing factors to erosion, due to mechanised agricultural equipment that allows for deep plowing, which severely increases the amount of soil that is available for transport by [[water erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Blanco, Humberto &amp; Lal, Rattan|chapter=Tillage erosion|title=Principles of Soil Conservation and Management|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-90-481-8529-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wj3690PbDY0C&amp;pg=PA109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lobb, D.A.|chapter=Soil movement by tillage and other agricultural activities|editor=Jorgenson, Sven E.|title=Applications in Ecological Engineering|publisher=Academic Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-444-53448-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aRKO6ZazC8UC&amp;pg=PA247}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The phenomenon called ''peak soil'' describes how large-scale factory farming techniques are affecting humanity's ability to grow food in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Peak Soil: Why cellulosic ethanol, biofuels are unsustainable and a threat to America |url=http://culturechange.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=107&amp;Itemid=1 |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without efforts to improve soil management practices, the availability of [[Arable land|arable soil]] may become increasingly problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CopperWiki Soil erosion |url=http://www.copperwiki.org/index.php?title=Soil_erosion |accessdate=2013-01-05}}{{unreliable source?|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods to combat erosion include [[no-till farming]], using a [[keyline design]], growing [[Hedge|wind breaks]] to hold the soil, and widespread use of [[compost]]. [[Fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s can also have an effect of soil erosion,{{cn|date=July 2018}} which can contribute to [[soil salinity]] and prevent other species from growing. [[Phosphate]] is a primary component in the chemical fertiliser applied most commonly in modern agricultural production. However, scientists estimate that rock phosphate reserves will be depleted in 50–100 years and that ''Peak Phosphate'' will occur in about 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095937800800099X |title=The story of phosphorus: Global food security and food for thought |author=Cordell|journal= Global Environmental Change |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2013-01-06|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2008.10.009 |volume=19 |pages=292–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Industrial process]]ing and [[logistics]] also have an effect on agriculture's sustainability. The way and locations crops are [[selling|sold]] requires energy for transportation, as well as the energy cost for materials, [[labour (economics)|labour]], and [[transport]]. Food sold at a local location, such a [[farmers' market]], have reduced energy overheads.

===Air===
Air is a renewable resource. All [[living organisms]] need [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]] (directly or indirectly), [[carbon]] (directly or indirectly) and many other gases in small [[quantities]] for their [[survival skills|survival]].

==Non-food resources==
[[File:Douglas des farges 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Douglas fir]] forest created in 1850, [[Meymac]] (Corrèze), France]]
{{main article|Energy crop|Non-food crop}}
An important renewable resource is [[wood]] provided by means of [[forestry]], which has been used for construction, housing and firewood since ancient times.
&lt;ref Name=unece&gt;[http://www.unece.org/unece-main/info-resources/presscurrent-press-h/forestry-and-timber/2012/wood-confirmed-as-the-primary-source-of-renewable-energy-in-europe/wood-confirmed-as-the-primary-source-of-renewable-energy-in-europe.html Wood confirmed as the primary source of renewable energy in Europe, UNECE February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=fao&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/014/am859e/am859e08.pdf FAO Factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=woodecon&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/business/21575771-environmental-lunacy-europe-fuel-future  Wood The fuel of the future] Environmental lunacy in Europe, Economist title story Apr 6th 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Plants provide the main sources for renewable resources, the main distinction is made between [[energy crop]]s and [[non-food crop]]s. A large variety of [[Grease (lubricant)|lubricants]], industrially used vegetable oils, textiles and fibre made e.g. of [[cotton]], [[copra]] or [[hemp]], [[paper]] derived from [[wood]], [[Textile|rags]] or [[grass]]es, [[bioplastic]] are based on plant renewable resources. A large variety of chemical based products like [[latex]], [[ethanol]], [[resin]], [[sugar]] and [[starch]] can be provided with plant renewables. Animal based renewables include [[fur]], [[leather]], technical [[fat]] and lubricants and further derived products, as e.g. [[animal glue]], [[tendon]]s, [[Casing (sausage)|casings]] or in historical times [[ambergris|ambra]] and [[baleen]] provided by [[whaling]].

With regard to pharmacy ingredients and legal and illegal drugs, plants are important sources, however e.g. venom of snakes, frogs and insects has been a valuable renewable source of pharmacological ingredients. Before GMO production set in, [[insulin]] and important [[hormones]] were based on animal sources. [[Feather]]s, an important byproduct of poultry farming for food, is still being used as filler and as base for [[keratin]] in general. Same applies for the [[chitin]] produced in farming [[Crustacean]]s which may be used as base of [[chitosan]]. The most important part of the human body used for non-medical purposes is [[human hair]] as for [[artificial hair integrations]], which is being traded worldwide.

===Historical role===
[[File:Japan Factory Ship Nisshin Maru Whaling Mother and Calf.jpg|left|thumb|An adult and sub-adult [[Minke whale]] are dragged aboard the [[Nisshin Maru]], a Japanese whaling vessel]]
[[File:Hanfdaemmstoff CG.jpg|right|thumb|[[Hemp#Building material|Hemp]] insulation, a renewable resource used as [[Sustainable living#Sustainable building materials|building material]]]]

Historically, renewable resources like firewood, [[latex]],  [[guano]], [[charcoal]], [[wood ash]], plant colors as [[indigo]], and whale products have been crucial for human needs but failed to supply demand in the beginning of the industrial era.&lt;ref name=rad/&gt; Early modern times faced large problems with overuse of renewable resources as in [[deforestation]], [[overgrazing]] or [[overfishing]].&lt;ref name=rad/&gt;

In addition to fresh meat and milk, which as food items are not the topic of this section, [[livestock]] farmers and artisans used further animal ingredients as  [[tendon]]s, horn, bones, bladders. Complex technical constructions as the [[composite bow]] were based on combination of animal and plant based materials. The current distribution conflict between biofuel and food production is being described as [[Food vs. fuel]]. Conflicts between food needs and usage, as supposed by [[fief]] obligations were in so far common in historical times as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wageningenacademic.com/_clientfiles/download/livestockhousing-e_01.pdf A short history of livestock production]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, J.

Jahrhundert, Ulmer, 1984, {{ISBN|3-8001-3061-0}}, (History of livestock breeding in Germany)&lt;/ref&gt; Oxen and horses were important for transportation purposes,  drove engines as e.g. in [[treadmill]]s.

Other regions solved the transportation problem with [[Terrace (agriculture)|terracing]], [[urban agriculture|urban]] and garden agriculture.&lt;ref name=rad&gt;Nature and Power: A Global History of the Environment. By Joachim Radkau. Publications of the German Historical Institute Series. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Further conflicts as between forestry and herding, or (sheep) herders and cattle farmers led to various solutions. Some confined wool production and sheep to large state and nobility domains or outsourced to professional shepherds with larger wandering herds.&lt;ref&gt;Veröffentlichungen des Max-Planck-Instituts für Geschichte. 2, Band 0, Max-Planck-Institut für Geschichte, Reiner Prass, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1958, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Agricultural Revolution]] was mainly based on a new system of [[crop rotation]], the  four-field rotation. [[United Kingdom|British]] agriculturist [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Charles Townshend]] recognised the invention in Dutch [[Waasland]] and popularised it in the 18th century UK, [[George Washington Carver]] in the USA. The system used [[wheat]], [[turnip]]s and [[barley]] and introduced as well [[clover]]. Clover is able to fix nitrogen from air, a practically non exhaustive renewable resource, into fertilizing compounds to the soil and allowed to increase yields by large. Farmers opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop. Thus [[livestock]] could to be bred year-round and winter [[culling]] was avoided. The amount of manure rose and allowed more crops but to refrain from [[wood pasture]].&lt;ref name=rad/&gt;

Early modern times and the 19th century saw the previous resource base partially replaced respectively supplemented by large scale chemical synthesis and by the use of fossil and mineral resources respectively.&lt;ref name= DCH/&gt; Besides the still central role of wood, there is a sort of renaissance of renewable products based on modern agriculture, genetic research and extraction technology. Besides fears about an upcoming [[peak oil|global shortage of fossil fuels]], local shortages due to boycotts, war and blockades or just transportation problems in remote regions have contributed to different methods of replacing or substituting fossil resources based on renewables.

===Challenges===
The use of certain basically renewable products as in [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Animal substances|TCM]] [[endangered species|endangers various species]]. Just the black market in [[rhinoceros horn]] reduced the world's rhino population by more than 90 percent over the past 40 years.&lt;ref name=RH&gt;''"Rhino horn: All myth, no medicine"'', ''National Geographic'', Rhishja Larson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FTCMRH&gt;''Facts about traditional Chinese medicine (TCM): rhinoceros horn'', Encyclopædia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/1035448/traditional-Chinese-medicine-TCM-as-discussed-in-rhinoceros-mammal Facts about traditional Chinese medicine (TCM): rhinoceros horn, as discussed in rhinoceros (mammal):&amp;nbsp;– Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renewables used for self sufficiency===
[[Image:FA Geisenheim22.jpg|thumb|In vitro-culture of Vitis (grapevine), [[Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute]]]]
The success of the German chemical industry till World War I was based on the replacement of colonial products. The predecessors of [[IG Farben]]  dominated the world market for [[Dye|synthetic dyes]] at the beginning of the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aftalion|1991|p=104}}, {{Harvnb|Chandler|2004|p=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had an important role in artificial [[Drug|pharmaceuticals]], [[photographic film]], [[Agrichemical|agricultural chemicals]] and [[Electrochemistry|electrochemicals]].&lt;ref name= DCH&gt;{{Cite book|title = The German Chemical Industry in the Twentieth Century|last = Lesch|first = John E.|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year = 2000|isbn = |location = |pages = 219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the former [[Plant breeding]] research institutes took a different approach. After the loss of the [[German colonial empire]], important players in the field as [[Erwin Baur]] and [[Konrad Meyer]] switched to using local crops as base for economic [[autarky]].&lt;ref name="heim"&gt;Autarkie und Ostexpansion: Pflanzenzucht und Agrarforschung im Nationalsozialismus, (agrarian research during the NS regime) Susanne Heim, Wallstein, 2002, {{ISBN|389244496X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Autarkie und Ostexpansion: Pflanzenzucht und Agrarforschung im Nationalsozialismus, (agrarian research during the NS regime)|last = Heim|first = Susanne|publisher = Wallstein|year = 2002|isbn = 389244496X|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer as a key agricultural scientist and spatial planner of the Nazi era managed and lead [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] resources and focused about a third of the complete research grants in Nazi Germany on agricultural and genetic research and especially on resources needed in case of a further German war effort.&lt;ref name="heim"/&gt;  A wide array of agrarian research institutes still existing today and having importance in the field was founded or enlarged in the time.

There were some major failures as trying to e.g. grow [[Hardiness (plants)|frost resistant]] olive species, but some success in the case of [[hemp]], [[flax]], [[rapeseed]], which are still of current importance.&lt;ref name="heim"/&gt; During World War 2, German scientists tried to use Russian [[Taraxacum]] (dandelion) species to manufacture [[natural rubber]].&lt;ref name="heim"/&gt;  Rubber dandelions are still of interest, as scientists in the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME) announced 2013 to have developed a cultivar that is suitable for commercial production of natural rubber.&lt;ref name=sciencedaily&gt;{{cite web|title=Making Rubber from Dandelion Juice|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/131028114547.htm|work=sciencedaily.com|publisher=sciencedaily.com|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal situation and subsidies==
Several legal and economic means have been used to enhance the market share of renewables.
The UK uses [[Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation]]s (NFFO), a collection of [[Statutory Instrument|orders]] requiring the electricity [[Distribution Network Operator]]s in [[England]] and [[Wales]] to purchase electricity from the [[nuclear power]] and [[renewable energy]] sectors. Similar mechanisms operate in [[Scotland]] (the Scottish Renewable Orders under the Scottish Renewables Obligation) and [[Northern Ireland]] (the Northern Ireland Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation). In the USA, [[Renewable Energy Certificates]] (RECs), use a similar approach. German [[Energy transition|Energiewende]] is using fed-in tariffs. An unexpected outcome of the subsidies was the quick increase of pellet byfiring in conventional fossil fuel plants (compare [[Tilbury power stations]]) and cement works, making wood respectively biomass accounting for about half of Europe’s renewable-energy consumption.&lt;ref Name=woodecon/&gt;

==Examples of industrial use==

===Biorenewable chemicals===

The tremendous diversity of enzymes in biological organisms, and the potential for [[synthetic biology]] to alter these enzymes to create yet new chemical functionalities, can drive the chemical industry.  A major platform for creation of new chemicals is the [[polyketide]] biosynthetic pathway, which generates chemicals containing repeated [[alkyl]] chain units with potential for a wide variety of [[functional group]]s at the different carbon atoms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garg|first=Shivani|last2=Rizhsky|first2=Ludmila|last3=Jin|first3=Huanan|last4=Yu|first4=Xiaochen|last5=Jing|first5=Fuyuan|last6=Yandeau-Nelson|first6=Marna D.|last7=Nikolau|first7=Basil J.|title=Microbial production of bi-functional molecules by diversification of the fatty acid pathway|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1096717616000045|journal=Metabolic Engineering|volume=35|pages=9–20|doi=10.1016/j.ymben.2016.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leber|first=Christopher|last2=Da Silva|first2=Nancy A.|date=2014-02-01|title=Engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the synthesis of short chain fatty acids|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.25021/abstract|journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering|language=en|volume=111|issue=2|pages=347–358|doi=10.1002/bit.25021|issn=1097-0290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deforestation===

{{main article|Deforestation}}
[[File:Deforestation Carceres Braasil 1996.jpg|thumb|[[Deforestation in Brazil]] 1996]]
Besides their role as a resource for fuel and building material, trees protect the environment by absorbing carbon dioxide and by creating oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chemistry.about.com/od/environmentalchemistry/f/oxygen-produced-by-trees.htm How Much Oxygen Does One Tree Produce?] By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D., About.com Guide&lt;/ref&gt;  The destruction of rain forests is one of the critical causes of [[climate change]]. Deforestation causes carbon dioxide to linger in the atmosphere. As carbon dioxide accrues, it produces a layer in the atmosphere that traps radiation from the sun. The radiation converts to heat which causes [[global warming]], which is better known as the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;Mumoki, Fiona. “The Effects of Deforestation on our Environment Today.” Panorama. TakingITGlobal. 18 July 2006. Web. 24 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deforestation also affects the [[water cycle]]. It reduces the content of water in the soil and groundwater as well as atmospheric moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html |title=Underlying Causes of Deforestation |work=UN Secretary-General’s Report |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411092448/http://wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html |archivedate=2001-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation reduces soil cohesion, so that [[Soil erosion|erosion]], flooding and [[landslide]]s ensue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwec.edu/jolhm/EH2/Rogge/index.htm|author=Daniel Rogge|work=University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire|title=Deforestation and Landslides in Southwestern Washington|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805191140/http://www.uwec.edu/jolhm/EH2/Rogge/index.htm|archivedate=2012-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/413717.stm |title=China's floods: Is deforestation to blame? |publisher=BBC News |date=August 6, 1999 |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rain forests house many species and organisms providing people with food and other commodities.

It has been estimated that over 40% of all living species on Earth are at risk of going extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/threatened-species/|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170525032656/http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/threatened-species/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 May 2017|title=Threatened Species|publisher=Conservation and Wildlife|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many nations have laws to protect hunted species and to restrict the practice of hunting. Other conservation methods include restricting land development or creating preserves. The [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/red-list-overview |title=Red List Overview |date=February 2011 |publisher=IUCN |accessdate=2 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527175928/http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/red-list-overview |archivedate=27 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, 199 countries have signed an accord agreeing to create [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s to protect endangered and other threatened species.

'''Rough fuzzy hybridization''' is a method of [[hybrid intelligent system]] or [[soft computing]], where [[Fuzzy set]] theory is used for linguistic representation of patterns, leading to a ''fuzzy granulation'' of the [[feature space]]. [[Rough set]] theory is used to obtain dependency rules which model informative regions in the granulated feature space.

==History==
{{expand section|date=November 2016}}
In 2006 school district officials stated that disorder was not increasing at Roxborough High while some teachers stated that it was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Snyder, Susan|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-143343554.html|title=Tension at Roxborough High: Teachers say disorder is on the rise.

In 2010 [[Manayunk, Philadelphia|Manayunk]] resident and Philadelphia School District teacher Keith Newman criticized the school district's handling of the high school, stating that it should not be ranked as "persistently dangerous" since it is in a relatively well-to-do area. At the time he was running for election for a political position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Scally, Bernard J.|url=http://www.montgomerynews.com/articles/2010/05/09/roxborough_review/news/doc4be0896b94a54803448993.txt?viewmode=fullstory|title=Candidate Profile - 'A regular guy'|publisher=''[[Roxborough Review]]''|date=2010-05-09|accessdate=2016-11-16|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6m442G9KZ?url=http://www.montgomerynews.com/articles/2010/05/09/roxborough_review/news/doc4be0896b94a54803448993.txt?viewmode=fullstory|archivedate=2016-11-16|df=}} ()&lt;/ref&gt;

Roxborough alumnus Stephen Brandt made efforts to turn around the school during his time as principal. The school district had asked him, previously a [[Norristown School District]] employee, to help improve the high school. He received the 2013 Lindback Award for Distinguished Principal Leadership. In 2013 Brandt, then the outgoing principal, stated that Dana Jenkins was going to be the new principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Scally, Bernard J.|url=http://www.montgomerynews.com/articles/2013/06/14/roxborough_review/news/doc51b745e5a0979592908489.txt|title=New principal named for Roxborough High|publisher=''[[Roxborough Review]]''|date=2013-06-14|accessdate=2016-11-16}} ([https://www.webcitation.org/6m40YiyNV?url=http://www.montgomerynews.com/articles/2013/06/14/roxborough_review/news/doc51b745e5a0979592908489.txt?viewmode=fullstory Archive])&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the school received a $1 million grant from the Philadelphia School Partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Graham, Kristen A.|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/education/20161010_City_school_getting__1M.html|title=City school getting $1M|publisher=''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]''|date=2016-10-10|accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic performance==
In 2015 Jenkins stated that the graduation rate was 84%.

This photo shows regeneration, a tree growing out of the stump of another tree that was felled in 1962 by the remnants of [[1962 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Freda|Typhoon Freda]].]]

A '''secondary forest''' (or '''second-growth forest''') is a [[forest]] or [[woodland]] area which has re-grown after a [[logging|timber harvest]], until a long enough period has passed so that the effects of the [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] are no longer evident. It is distinguished from an [[old-growth forest]] (primary or primeval forest), which has not recently undergone such disruption, and complex early seral forest, as well as third-growth forests that result from harvest in second growth forests. Secondary forest regrowing after timber harvest differs from forest [[Ecological succession|regrowing]] after natural [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbances]] such as [[Wildfire|fire]], insect infestation, or [[windthrow]] because the dead trees remain to provide nutrients, structure, and water retention after natural disturbances. However, often after natural disturbance the timber is harvested and removed from the system, in which case the system more closely resembles secondary forest rather than complex early [[Seral community|seral]] forest.

==Description==
Depending on the forest, the development of primary characteristics may take anywhere from a century to several millennia. [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|Hardwood forests]] of the [[eastern United States]], for example, can develop primary characteristics in one or two generations of [[tree]]s, or 150–500 years. Often the disruption is the result of human activity, such as [[logging]], but natural phenomena that produce the same effect are often included in the definition. 
Secondary forests tend to have trees closer spaced than primary forests and contain less [[undergrowth]] than primary forests.  Secondary forests typically were thought to lack [[biodiversity]] compared to primary forests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chazdon|first=Robin L.|title=Beyond deforestation: restoring forests and ecosystem services on degraded lands|journal=Science|volume=320|issue=5882|year=2008|pages=1458–1460|url=http://lerf.eco.br/img/publicacoes/2008_2411%20Beyond%20Deforestation%20Restoring%20Forests%20and%20Ecosystem%20Services%20on%20Degraded%20Lands.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this has been challenged in recent years.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Usually, secondary forests have only one [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]] layer, whereas primary forests have several.

Secondary forestation is common in areas where forests have been lost by the [[Slash and burn|slash-and-burn]] method, a component of some [[shifting cultivation]] systems of agriculture. Secondary forests may also arise from forest that has been harvested heavily or over a long period of time, forest that is naturally regenerating from fire and from abandoned pastures or areas of agriculture.  It takes a secondary forest typically forty to 100 years to begin to resemble the original old-growth forest; however, in some cases a secondary forest will not succeed, due to [[erosion]] or [[soil conservation|soil nutrient loss]] in certain [[tropical forest]]s.

Secondary forests re-establish by the process of succession.  Openings created in the [[Canopy (forest)|forest canopy]] allow sunlight to reach the forest floor.  An area that has been cleared will first be colonized by pioneer species.  Even though some species loss may occur with primary forest removal, a secondary forest can protect the watershed from further erosion and provides habitat.  Secondary forests may also buffer [[edge effect]]s around [[habitat fragmentation|mature forest fragments]] and increase connectivity between them.  They may also be a source of wood and other forest products.

Today most of the forest of the United States, the eastern part of North America and Europe consist of secondary forest.

==Rainforests==
In the case of tropical [[rainforest]]s, where soil [[nutrient]] levels are characteristically low, the soil quality may be significantly diminished following the removal of [[primary forest]]. In [[Panama]], growth of new forests from abandoned farmland exceeded loss of primary rainforest in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/30/science/earth/30forest.html "New Jungles Prompt a Debate on Rain Forests"] article by Elisabeth Rosenthal in ''[[The New York Times]]''  January 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the diminished quality of soil, among other factors, the presence of a significant majority of primary forest species fail to recover in these second-growth forests.

The '''Simonyi Professorship for the Public Understanding of Science''' is a chair at the [[University of Oxford]]. The chair was established in 1995 for the [[Ethology|ethologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] by an endowment from [[Charles Simonyi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims/charles-simonyis-manifesto.html ''Charles Simonyi's manifesto''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205051240/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims/charles-simonyis-manifesto.html |date=5 February 2016 }}, [[University of Oxford]] (page visited on 6 December 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=memoirs/&gt; The aim of the Professorship is 'to communicate science to the public without, in doing so, losing those elements of scholarship which constitute the essence of true understanding'. It is a position that had been endowed by [[Charles Simonyi]] with the express intention that the holder "be expected to make important contributions to the public understanding of some scientific field",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims/manifesto.shtml |title=Manifesto for the Simonyi Professorship |accessdate=13 March 2008 |author=Simonyi, Charles |authorlink=Charles Simonyi |date=15 May 1995 |publisher=The University of Oxford|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080423211123/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims/manifesto.shtml |archivedate =23 April 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that its first holder should be Richard Dawkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims/index.shtml |title=Aims of the Simonyi Professorship |date=23 April 2008 |accessdate=28 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423211118/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims/index.shtml |archivedate=23 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2078">'''Temporary laws''', '''temporary legislation''' or '''sunset legislation''' are [[laws]] whose duration is limited at the time of enactment. Temporary laws are often used to adapt for unusual or peculiar situations. Clauses limiting the duration of such laws are often called "sunset" clauses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/t/temporary-statue/|title=Temporary Statue Law and Legal Definition - USLegal, Inc.|first=US Legal,|last=Inc.|website=definitions.uslegal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temporary laws are commonly given temporal validity by the inclusion of an expiration date at which the law ceases to be in effect unless it is extended. But a law can also acquire temporal status by stipulating that it only applies to a certain event. For example, only to the next election or only for victims of a named catastrophe.

Temporary laws are favored by adherents of "[[Experimentalist governance]]" because it allows policy makers to conduct experiments and evaluate the effects of introducing legislation.

Temporary laws are often easier to pass since they last for a shorter time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2159549|title=Law and the Limits of Government: Temporary versus Permanent Legislation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temporary law should not be confused with ''ratione temporis'' or ''temporal jurisdiction'' which refers to the jurisdiction of a ''court'' of law in relation to the passage of time. 

== Examples ==
Some examples of temporary laws:
* [[May Laws]], enacted in [[Russia]] in 1882. Originally intended to expire after one year but were extended indefinitely.
* [[Tehcir Law]], enacted by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1915 authorized the [[ethnic cleansing]] of the empire's [[Armenians|Armenian]] population. 
* [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] passed in 1994 contained several provisions that were temporary in nature.
* [[Patriot Act]], enacted in the [[United States]] in 2001.
* [[Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law]], enacted in [[Israel]] in 2003.

'''Third gender''' or '''third sex''' is a concept in which individuals are categorized, either by themselves or by society, as neither [[man]] nor [[woman]]. It is also a social category present in [[gender systems|societies]] that recognize three or more [[gender]]s. The term ''third'' is usually understood to mean "other"; some [[Cultural anthropology|anthropologists]] and [[Sociology|sociologists]] have described&lt;!--

[[Biology]] determines whether a human's chromosomal and anatomical [[sex]] is [[male]], [[female]], or one of the uncommon [[Disorders of sex development|variations]] on this [[Sexual dimorphism#Humans|sexual dimorphism]] that can create a degree of ambiguity known as [[intersex]].&lt;ref name="Money"&gt;{{cite book|last=Money |first=John |author2=Ehrhardt, Anke A. |title=Man &amp; Woman Boy &amp; Girl.

Not all cultures have strictly defined gender roles.&lt;ref name=LeBow&gt;LeBow, Diana, ''Rethinking Matriliny Among the Hopi'', p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schlegel&gt;Schlegel, Alice, ''Hopi Gender Ideology of Female Superiority'', in ''Quarterly Journal of Ideology: "A Critique of the Conventional Wisdom"'', vol.

In different cultures, a third or fourth gender may represent very different things. To [[Native Hawaiians]] and [[Tahitians]], ''[[Māhū]]'' is an intermediate state between man and woman, or a "person of indeterminate gender".&lt;ref name="vargas2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Llosa |first1=Mario Vargas |authorlink1=Mario Vargas Llosa |title=The men-women of the Pacific |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/men-women-pacific |website=tate.org.uk |publisher=[[Tate Britain]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WpIsllud?url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/men-women-pacific |archivedate=6 March 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional [[Navajo|Diné]] of the Southwestern US acknowledge four genders: feminine woman, masculine woman, feminine man, masculine man.&lt;ref name=Estrada/&gt; The term "third gender" has also been used to describe [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]s of [[India]]&lt;ref name="agrawal1997"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/006996697031002005 |title=Gendered Bodies: The Case of the 'Third Gender' in India |year=1997 |last1=Agrawal |first1=A. |journal=Contributions to Indian Sociology |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=273–297}}

The community of third gender may also face discrimination from within the gay community. Despite having been legalized in the majority of South Asia, sexual minorities in Sri Lanka are hesitant to fight for third gender rights as departing from the traditional binary gender concept might make it harder to push through other aspects of LGBT rights.  It's notably that the island's two neighboring Indian states were among the first in the post-colonial world to legally recognize third gender.

==Sex and gender==
Since at least the 1970s, [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] have described [[gender role|gender categories]] in some cultures which they could not adequately explain using a two-gender framework.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; At the same time, [[Feminism|feminists]] began to draw a distinction between (biological) [[sex]] and (social/psychological) [[gender]]. Contemporary [[gender studies|gender theorists]] usually argue that a two-gender system is neither innate nor universal. A sex/gender system which recognizes only the following two social [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] has been labeled "[[heteronormative]]".{{By whom|date=May 2018}}

Anthropologist Michael G. Peletz believes our notions of different types of genders (including the attitudes toward the third gender) deeply affect our lives and reflects our values in society. In Peletz' book, "Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia", he describes:&lt;ref name=Gender&gt;{{cite book|last=Peletz|first=Michael G.|title=Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia|year=2007|publisher=Association for Asian Studies|location=Michigan|isbn=9780924304507}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|For our purposes, the term "gender" designates the cultural categories, symbols, meanings, practices, and institutionalized arrangements bearing on at least five sets of phenomena: (1) females and femininity; (2) males and masculinity; (3) Androgynes, who are partly male and partly female in appearance or of indeterminate sex/gender, as well as intersexed individuals, also known as hermaphrodites, who to one or another degree may have both male and female sexual organs or characteristics; (4) transgender people, who engage in practices that transgress or transcend normative boundaries and are thus by definition "transgressively gendered"; and (5) neutered or unsexed/ungendered individuals such as eunuchs.}}

=== Intersex people and third gender ===
{{main|Legal recognition of intersex people|Intersex and LGBT}}
[[Intersex]] people are born with [[sex]] characteristics, such as [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, or [[genital]]s that, according to the UN [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], "do not fit typical binary notions of [[male]] or [[female]] bodies".&lt;ref name="unfe-fact"&gt;{{Cite web| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | publisher = United Nations [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | title = Free &amp; Equal Campaign Fact Sheet: Intersex| date = 2015| url = https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | access-date = 28 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[sex and gender distinction]] is not universal, and Peletz's description of gender as designating biological variations as well as cultural practices is not unique. In a study of arguments that intersex people fit into a third gender classification, intersex scholar [[Morgan Holmes]] argues that much analysis of a third sex or third gender is simplistic:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holmes |first=Morgan |author-link=Morgan Holmes |date=July 2004 |title=Locating Third Sexes |url=http://www.transformationsjournal.org/issues/08/article_03.shtml |journal=Transformations Journal |volume= |issue=8 |pages= |issn=1444-3775 |accessdate=2014-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110091545/http://www.transformationsjournal.org/issues/08/article_03.shtml |archivedate=2017-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|much of the existing work on cultural systems that incorporate a 'third sex' portray simplistic visions in which societies with more than two sex/gender categories are cast as superior to those that divide the world into just two.

The [[Asia Pacific Forum]] of National Human Rights Institutions states that the legal recognition of intersex people is firstly about access to the same rights as other men and women, when assigned male or female; secondly it is about access to administrative corrections to legal documents when an original [[sex assignment]] is not appropriate; and thirdly it is not about the creation of a third sex or gender classification for intersex people as a population but it is, instead, about self-determination.&lt;ref name="afp2016"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = [[Asia Pacific Forum|Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions]]| isbn = 978-0-9942513-7-4| last = Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions| title = Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics| date = June 2016| url = http://www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/manual-sogi-and-sex-charactersitics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transgender people and third gender ===
Gender may be organized differently in different cultures. In some non-Western cultures, gender is not binary and one can cross freely between male and female. This is seen as a mediation between the spirit and mundane worlds.&lt;ref name="SellIngrid"&gt;Sell, Ingrid M.  "Third gender: A qualitative study of the experience of individuals who identify as being neither man nor woman."  The Psychotherapy Patient.  13.1/2 (2004): p.132&lt;/ref&gt; It is seen as a positive and is almost revered in many Eastern cultures, whereas in Western culture, people who don’t conform to [[heteronormative]] ideals are often seen as sick, disordered, or insufficiently formed.&lt;ref name="SellIngrid" /&gt;

To the Indigenous [[Māhū]] of Hawaii, it is an intermediate state between man and woman, or to be a "person of indeterminate gender";&lt;ref name="vargas2015" /&gt; While the traditional [[Navajo|Dineh]] of the Southwestern US acknowledge four genders: feminine woman, masculine woman, feminine man, masculine man.&lt;ref name=Estrada/&gt; The term "third gender" has also been used to describe [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]s of South Asia&lt;ref name="agrawal1997" /&gt; who have gained legal identity, [[fa'afafine]] of Polynesia, and [[Albanian sworn virgins|sworn virgins]] of the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt;

In Africa{{Vague|date=August 2018}}, a woman can be recognized as a “female husband” who enjoys all of the privileges of men and is recognized as such, but whose femaleness, while not openly acknowledged, is not forgotten either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stern|first1=E Mark|last2=Marchesani|first2=Robert B|title=Saints and Rogues: Conflicts and Convergence in Psychotherapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QtIJBAAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-71804-8|page=135|chapter=Third gender: A qualitative study of the experience of individuals who identify as being neither man nor woman|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=QtIJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]s, of India, are one of the most recognized and socially accepted groups of third genders. This may be a result of the notion of [[reincarnation]], which reduces not only gender categorization but also sex and species, allowing for more fluid and mutable categorization. There are countless other cultures in which the third gender is seen as an intermediate being rather than as a movement from one conventional sex to the other, either male to female or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Hines, Sally, and Tam Sanger. Transgender Identities: Towards a Social Analysis of Gender Diversity. New York: Routledge, 2010. Print. p.244&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of people in the United States who thought themselves to be members of a third gender, Ingrid M. Sell found that they typically felt different from the age of 5.&lt;ref name="SellIngrid_a"&gt;Sell, Ingrid M.  "Third gender: A qualitative study of the experience of individuals who identify as being neither man nor woman."  The Psychotherapy Patient.  13.1/2 (2004): p.139&lt;/ref&gt; Because of both peer and parental pressure, those growing up with the most ambiguous appearances had the most troubled childhoods and difficulties later in life. Sell also discovered similarities between the third genders of the East and those of the West. Nearly half of those interviewed were healers or in the medical profession. A majority of them, again like their Eastern counterparts, were artistic enough to make a living from their abilities. The capacity to mediate between men and women was a common skill, and third genders were oftentimes thought to possess an unusually wide perspective and the ability to understand both sides.&lt;ref name="SellIngrid_a" /&gt; A notable result of Sell's study is that 93% of the third genders interviewed, again like their Eastern counterparts, reported “paranormal”-type abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Sell, Ingrid M.  "Third gender: A qualitative study of the experience of individuals who identify as being neither man nor woman."  The Psychotherapy Patient.  13.1/2 (2004): p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, some Western societies have begun to recognize genderqueer or non-binary identities. Some years after Alex MacFarlane, Australian [[Norrie May-Welby]] was recognized as having unspecified status.&lt;ref name="Daily"&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2010/03/16/2010-03-16_no_sex_for_me_please_extranssexual_briton_is_first_legally_genderless_person.html "No sex for me, please!

The [[Open Society Foundations]] published a report, ''License to Be Yourself'' in May 2014, documenting "some of the world's most progressive and rights-based laws and policies that enable trans people to change their gender identity on official documents".&lt;ref name=License&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrne |first=Jack |author-link= |title= License to Be Yourself |year=2014|publisher=[[Open Society Foundations]] |location=New York |isbn=9781940983103 |url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/reports/license-be-yourself | accessdate=2014-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report comments on the recognition of third classifications, stating:
{{quote|
From a rights-based perspective, third sex / gender options should be voluntary, providing trans people with a third choice about how to define their gender identity. Those identifying as a third sex / gender should have the same rights as those identifying as male or female.}}

The document also quotes [[Mauro Cabral]] of [[Global Action for Trans Equality]]:
{{quote|
People tend to identify a third sex with freedom from the gender binary, but that is not necessarily the case. If only trans and/or intersex people can access that third category, or if they are compulsively assigned to a third sex, then the gender binary gets stronger, not weaker.}}

The report concludes that two or three options are insufficient: "A more inclusive approach would be to increase options for people to self-define their sex and gender identity."&lt;ref name="License" /&gt;

=== Third gender and sexual orientation ===
[[Image:Thirdsex bookcover 1959.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cover of Artemis Smith's 1959 [[lesbian pulp fiction]] novel ''The Third Sex'']]

Before the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s, there was no common non-derogatory vocabulary for [[Non-heterosexuals|non-heterosexuality]]; terms such as "third gender" trace back to the 1860s.&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld 1904"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis 1897"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fordham.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duc, Aimée 1901"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Social Studies C"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=E. Wayne |title=The Social Studies Curriculum: Purposes, Problems, and Possibilities |publisher=SUNY Press |year=2006|isbn= 978-0-7914-6909-5 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4qFMqjxte9IC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Hubert C. (1980) ''The "third sex" theory of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs'', Journal of Homosexuality. 1980–1981 Fall–Winter; 6(1–2): pp. 103–1&lt;/ref&gt;

One such term, [[Uranian]], was used in the 19th century to a person of a third sex—originally, someone with "a female psyche in a male body" who is sexually attracted to men. Its definition was later extended to cover [[homosexual]] [[gender variant]] females and a number of other sexual types. It is believed to be an [[English language|English]] adaptation of the [[German language|German]] word ''Urning'', which was first published by activist [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] (1825–95) in a series of five booklets (1864–65) that were collected under the title ''Forschungen über das Räthsel der mannmännlichen Liebe'' ("Research into the Riddle of Man-Male Love"). Ulrich developed his terminology before the first public use of the term "homosexual", which appeared in 1869 in a pamphlet published anonymously by [[Karl-Maria Kertbeny]] (1824–82). The word Uranian (''Urning'') was derived by Ulrichs from the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] [[Aphrodite Urania]], who was created out of [[Uranus (mythology)|the god Uranus' testicles]]; it stood for homosexuality, while Aphrodite Dionea (''Dioning'') represented heterosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmkaylor.com Michael Matthew Kaylor, ''Secreted Desires: The Major Uranians: Hopkins, Pater and Wilde'' (Brno, CZ: Masaryk University Press, 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbian activist [[Anna Rueling]] used the term in a 1904 speech, "What Interest Does the Women's Movement Have in Solving the Homosexual Problem?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pAny0qfa6qsC&amp;pg=PA79|title=Finding Out: An Introduction to LGBT Studies|first1=Deborah T.|last1=Meem|first2=Michelle|last2=Gibson|first3=Michelle A.|last3=Gibson|first4=Jonathan|last4=Alexander|date=28 May 2018|publisher=SAGE|via=Google Books|isbn=9781412938655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some scholars, the West is trying to reinterpret and redefine ancient third-gender identities to fit the Western concept of [[sexual orientation]]. In ''Redefining [[Fa'afafine]]: Western Discourses and the Construction of Transgenderism in Samoa'', Johanna Schmidt argues that the Western attempts to reinterpret fa'afafine, the third gender in Samoan culture, make it have more to do with sexual orientation than gender. She also argues that this is actually changing the nature of fa'afafine itself, and making it more "homosexual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue6/schmidt.html|title=Intersections: Redefining Fa'afafine: Western Discourses and the Construction of Transgenderism in Samoa|website=intersections.anu.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Samoan fa'afafine said, "But I would like to pursue a master's degree with a paper on homosexuality from a Samoan perspective that would be written for educational purposes, because I believe some of the stuff that has been written about us is quite wrong."&lt;ref&gt;[http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue6/schmidt.html Redefining Fa'afafine: Western Discourses and the Construction of Transgenderism in Samoa Johanna Schmidt]; Intersections: Gender, History and Culture in the Asian Context; Issue 6, August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''How to become a Berdache: Toward a unified analysis of gender diversity'', Will Roscoe writes that "this pattern can be traced from the earliest accounts of the Spaniards to present-day ethnographies. What has been written about berdaches reflects more the influence of existing Western discourses on gender, sexuality and the Other than what observers actually witnessed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phenomenologycenter.org/course/berdache.htm How to become a Berdache: Toward a unified analysis of gender diversity] Will Roscoe  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226235121/http://www.phenomenologycenter.org/course/berdache.htm |date=February 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Towle and Morgan:

{{quote|Ethnographic examples [of ‘third genders’] can come from distinct societies located in Thailand, Polynesia, Melanesia, Native America, western Africa, and elsewhere and from any point in history, from Ancient Greece, to sixteenth century England to contemporary North America. Popular authors routinely simplify their descriptions, ignoring...or conflating dimensions that seem to them extraneous, incomprehensible, or ill suited to the images they want to convey (484).&lt;ref&gt;[http://feed.belowthebelt.org/2009/10/great-third-gender-debate.html The Great Third Gender Debate; BELOW THE BELT, theory-q] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503222350/http://feed.belowthebelt.org/2009/10/great-third-gender-debate.html |date=May 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Western scholars often do not make a distinction between people of the third gender and males; they are often lumped together. The scholars usually use gender roles as a way to explain sexual relations between the third gender and males. For example, when analyzing the non-normative sex gender categories in [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]], Peter A. Jackson says it appears that within early Buddhist communities, men who engaged in receptive anal sex were seen as feminized and were thought to be [[hermaphrodite]]s. In contrast, men who engaged in oral sex were not seen as crossing sex/gender boundaries, but rather as engaging in abnormal sexual practices without threatening their masculine gendered existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rspas.anu.edu.au/papers/pah/theravada.html Non-normative Sex/Gender Categories in the Theravada Buddhist Scriptures]

Some writers suggest that a third gender emerged around 1700 AD in [[England]]: the male [[sodomy|sodomite]].&lt;ref name="Trumbach"&gt;Trumbach, Randolph. (1998) ''Sex and the Gender Revolution. Volume 1: Heterosexuality and the Third Gender in Enlightenment London''. Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1998. (Chicago Series on Sexuality, History &amp; Society)&lt;/ref&gt; According to these writers, this was marked by the emergence of a [[subculture]] of [[effeminate]] males and their meeting places ([[molly house]]s), as well as a marked increase in hostility towards effeminate or [[homosexual]] males. People described themselves as members of a third sex in Europe from at least the 1860s with the writings of [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1300/J082v06n01_10 | title=The "Third Sex" Theory of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs | year=1981 | last1=Kennedy | first1=Hubert | journal=Journal of Homosexuality | volume=6 | pages=103–111 | pmid=7042820 | issue=1–2  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing in the late nineteenth century with [[Magnus Hirschfeld]],&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld 1904"&gt;[[Magnus Hirschfeld|Hirschfeld, Magnus]], 1904.

Throughout much of the twentieth century, the term "third sex" was a common descriptor for homosexuals and gender nonconformists, but after the [[gay liberation]] movements of the 1970s and a growing separation of the concepts of [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]], the term fell out of favor among [[LGBT communities]] and the wider public. With the renewed exploration of gender that feminism, the modern [[transgender]] movement and [[queer theory]] has fostered, some in the contemporary West have begun to describe themselves as a third sex again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sell |first1= Ingrid |year=2001 |title=Not man, not woman: Psychospiritual characteristics of a Western third gender |journal= [[Journal of Transpersonal Psychology]] |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages= 16–36 }} (Complete doctoral dissertation: Sell, Ingrid. (2001). ''Third gender: A qualitative study of the experience of individuals who identify as being neither man nor woman.'' (Doctoral Dissertation, Institute of Transpersonal Psychology). UMI No. 3011299.)&lt;/ref&gt; Other modern identities that cover similar ground include [[pangender]], [[bigender]], [[genderqueer]], [[androgyne]], [[intergender]], "other gender" and "differently gendered".

=== Third gender and feminism ===

In [[German Empire#Wilhelmine era|Wilhelmine Germany]], the terms ''drittes Geschlecht'' ("third sex") and ''Mannweib'' ("man-woman") were also used to describe [[feminist]]s – both by their opponents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=407320 | pages=582–599 | last1=Wright | first1=B.

In the 1899 novel ''Das dritte Geschlecht'' (''The Third Sex'') by Ernst Ludwig von Wolzogen, feminists are portrayed as "neuters" with external female characteristics accompanied by a crippled male [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]].

==History==

===Mesopotamia===
[[Image:Sumerian creation myth.jpg|thumb|upright|Stone tablet from 2nd millennium BC Sumer containing a myth about the creation of a type of human who is neither man nor woman.]]
In [[Mesopotamian mythology]], among the earliest written records of humanity, there are references to types of people who are not men and not women. In a [[Sumer]]ian [[creation myth]] found on a stone tablet from the [[second millennium BC]], the goddess [[Ninmah]] fashions a being "with no male organ and no female organ", for whom [[Enki]] finds a position in society: "to stand before the king". In the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] myth of [[Atra-Hasis]] (ca. 1700 BC), Enki instructs [[Nintu]], the goddess of birth, to establish a “third category among the people” in addition to men and women, that includes demons who steal infants, women who are unable to give birth, and priestesses who are prohibited from bearing children.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stephen O., and Roscoe, Will (1997). ''Islamic Homosexualities: Culture, History, and Literature.''

In addition, he defines another kind of gender-variant prostitute, ''sinnisānu'', as (literally) "woman-like".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
Inscribed pottery shards from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] (2000–1800 BCE), found near ancient [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] (now [[Luxor]], [[Egypt]]), list three human genders: ''tai'' (male), ''sḫt'' ("sekhet") and ''hmt'' (female).&lt;ref&gt;Sethe, Kurt, (1926), ''Die Aechtung feindlicher Fürsten, Völker und Dinge auf altägyptischen Tongefäßscherben des mittleren Reiches,'' in: Abhandlungen der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Philosophisch-Historische Klasse, 1926, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sḫt'' is often translated as "eunuch", although there is little evidence that such individuals were castrated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.well.com/user/aquarius/egypt.htm The Third Gender in Ancient Egypt], Faris Malik.

The [[Vedas]] (c. 1500 BC–500 BC) describe individuals as belonging to one of three categories, according to one's nature or [[prakrti]]. These are also spelled out in the [[Kama Sutra]] (c. 4th century AD) and elsewhere as ''pums-prakrti'' (male-nature), ''stri-prakrti'' (female-nature), and ''tritiya-prakrti'' (third-nature).&lt;ref&gt;Alternate transliteration: ''trhytîyâ prakrhyti''&lt;/ref&gt; Texts suggest that third sex individuals were well known in premodern India and included male-bodied or female-bodied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1353/sex.2001.0018 | title=Hidden in History: Female Homoeroticism and Women of a "Third Nature" in the South Asian Past | year=2001 | last1=Penrose | first1=Walter | journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality | volume=10 | pages=3–39 [4] |quote=distinct social and economic roles once existed for women thought to belong to a third gender.

A third sex is discussed in ancient [[Hindu law]], medicine, [[linguistics]] and [[astrology]]. The foundational work of Hindu law, the [[Manu Smriti]] (c. 200 BC–200 AD) explains the biological origins of the three sexes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A male child is produced by a greater quantity of male seed, a female child by the prevalence of the female; if both are equal, a third-sex child or boy and girl twins are produced; if either are weak or deficient in quantity, a failure of conception results.&lt;ref&gt;[[Manu Smriti]], 3.49. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/manu/manu03.htm Text online].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Indian linguist [[Patañjali]]'s&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with the [[Patañjali]] who was the author of the ''[[Yoga sutras]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; work on [[Sanskrit]] grammar, the [[Mahābhāṣya]] (c. 200 BC), states that Sanskrit's three [[grammatical genders]] are derived from three natural genders. The earliest [[Tamil language|Tamil]] grammar, the [[Tolkappiyam]] (3rd century BC) refers to hermaphrodites as a third "neuter" gender (in addition to a feminine category of unmasculine males). In [[Vedic astrology]], the nine planets are each assigned to one of the three genders; the third gender, ''tritiya-prakrti'', is associated with [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Saturn]] and (in particular) [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]]. In the [[Puranas]], there are references to three kinds of [[deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s of music and dance: [[apsaras]] (female), [[gandharva]]s (male) and [[kinnar]]s (neuter).

The two great [[Sanskrit]] [[epic poem]]s, the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]],&lt;ref&gt;Lord [[Arjuna]] takes a "vow of eunuchism" to live as the third sex for a year: "O lord of the Earth, I will declare myself as one of the neuter sex. O monarch, it is, indeed difficult to hide the marks of the bowstring on my arms. I will, however, cover both my [[Scarification|cicatrized]] arms with bangles. Wearing brilliant rings on my ears and [[conch]]-bangles on my wrists and causing a braid to hang down from my head, I shall, O king, appear as one of the third sex, Vrihannala by name. And living as a female I shall (always) entertain the king and the inmates of the inner apartments by reciting stories. And, O king, I shall also instruct the women of Virata's palace in singing and delightful modes of dancing and in musical instruments of diverse kinds. And I shall also recite the various excellent acts of men..." [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15475 Mahabharata (Virata-parva)], Translated by Ganguli, Kisari Mohan. [[Project Gutenberg]].&lt;/ref&gt; indicate the existence of a third gender in ancient Indic society. Some versions of [[Ramayana]] tell that in one part of the story, the hero [[Rama]] heads into exile in the forest. Halfway there, he discovers that most of the people of his home town [[Ayodhya]] were following him. He told them, "Men and women, turn back", and with that, those who were "neither men nor women" did not know what to do, so they stayed there. When Rama returned from exile years later, he discovered them still there and blessed them, saying that there will be a day when they, too, will have a share in ruling the world.

In the Buddhist [[Vinaya]], codified in its present form around the 2nd century BC and said to be handed down by oral tradition from [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself, there are four main sex/gender categories: males, females, ''ubhatobyañjanaka'' (people of a dual sexual nature) and ''[[Pandaka|paṇḍaka]]'' (people of non-normative sexual natures, perhaps originally denoting a deficiency in male sexual capacity).&lt;ref name="Jackson10996" /&gt; As the Vinaya tradition developed, the term ''paṇḍaka'' came to refer to a broad third sex category which encompassed intersex, male and female bodied people with physical or behavioural attributes that were considered inconsistent with the natural characteristics of man and woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=3176712 | pages=89–115 | last1=Gyatso | first1=J. | title=One Plus One Makes Three: Buddhist Gender, Monasticism, and the Law of the Non-Excluded Middle | volume=43 | issue=2 | journal=[[History of Religions (journal)|History of Religions]] | year=2003 | doi=10.1086/423006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to what is often portrayed in the West, sex with male (specifically receptive oral and anal sex) was the gender role of the third gender, not their defining feature. Thus, in ancient India, as in present-day India, the society made a distinction between a third gender having sex with a man, and a man having sex with a man. The latter may have been viewed negatively, but he would be seen very much as a man (in modern western context, as 'straight'), not a third gender (in modern western context 'gay').&lt;ref&gt;[http://rspas.anu.edu.au/papers/pah/theravada.html Non-normative Sex/Gender Categories in the Theravada Buddhist Scriptures], compiled by Peter A. Jackson; quote: "it appears that among the early Buddhist communities men who engaged in receptive anal sex were seen as feminized and thought to be hermaphrodites. In contrast, men who engaged in oral sex were not seen as crossing sex/gender boundaries, but rather as engaging in abnormal sexual practices without threatening their masculine gendered existence."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Plato's ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', written around the 4th century BC, Aristophanes relates a creation myth involving three original sexes: female, male and androgynous. They are split in half by Zeus, producing four different contemporary sex/gender types which seek to be reunited with their lost other half; in this account, the modern heterosexual man and woman descend from the original androgynous sex. The myth of [[Hermaphroditus]] involves heterosexual lovers merging into their primordial androgynous sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/symposium.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive – Symposium by Plato|website=classics.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{non-primary source needed|date=June 2016}}

Other [[creation myth]]s around the world share a belief in three original sexes, such as those from northern Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Peter A. (1995) ''Kathoey: The third sex.'' In Jackson, P., "Dear Uncle Go: Male homosexuality in Thailand." Bangkok, Thailand: Bua Luang Books&lt;br&gt;See also: Peltier, Anatole-Roger (1991). ''Pathamamulamuli: The Origin of the World in the Lan Na Tradition''. Chiang Mai, Thailand: Silkworm Books. The Yuan creation myth in the book is from Pathamamulamuli, an antique Buddhist palmleaf manuscript. Its translator, Anatole-Roger Peltier, believes that this story is based on an oral tradition which is over five hundred years old.

Many have interpreted the "[[eunuch]]s" of the Ancient Eastern Mediterranean world as a third gender that inhabited a [[liminality|liminal]] space between women and men, understood in their societies as somehow neither or both.&lt;ref&gt;S. Tougher, ed., (2001) ''Eunuchs in Antiquity and Beyond'' (London: Duckworth Publishing, 2001).&lt;br&gt;Ringrose, Kathryn M. (2003). ''The Perfect Servant: Eunuchs and the Social Construction of Gender in Byzantium.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Historia Augusta]], the eunuch body is described as a ''tertium genus hominum'' (a third human gender),&lt;ref&gt;[[Historia Augusta]], ''[[Severus Alexander]]'' xxiii.7.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 77 BC, a eunuch named Genucius was prevented from claiming goods left to him in a [[will (law)|will]], on the grounds that he had voluntarily mutilated himself (''amputatis sui ipsius'') and was neither a woman or a man (''neque virorum neque mulierum numero'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]], (7.7.6).&lt;/ref&gt; Several scholars have argued that the eunuchs in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[New Testament]] were understood in their time to belong to a third gender, rather than the more recent interpretations of a kind of emasculated man, or a metaphor for [[chastity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hester |first1= J.

And elsewhere: "The Lord Himself opened the kingdom of heaven to eunuchs and He Himself lived as a eunuch. The apostle [Paul] also, following His example, made himself a eunuch..."&lt;/ref&gt; Tertullian also noted the existence of a third sex (''tertium sexus'') among heathens: "a third race in sex... made of male and female in one."&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''Ad nationes'', 1.20.4. [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian06.html Text online].&lt;/ref&gt; He may have been referring to the [[Galli]], "eunuch" devotees of the [[Phrygia]]n goddess [[Cybele]], who were described as belonging to a third sex by several [[ancient Rome|Roman]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. "Both sexes are displeasing to her holiness, so [the gallus] keeps a middle gender (''medium genus'') between the others." [[Prudentius]], Peristephanon, 10.1071-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
In old Israel there were:
*''Zachar'': male
*''Nekeva'': female
*''[[Androgynos]]'': both male and female genitalia (eternal doubt of legal gender)
*''[[Tumtum (Judaism)|Tumtum]]'': genitalia concealed by skin (unknown gender, unless skin removed)
*''Aylonit'': Barren female. Female genitalia, barren.
*''Saris'': castrated or naturally infertile male (often translated as "eunuch")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transtorah.org/PDFs/Classical_Jewish_Terms_for_Gender_Diversity.pdf] Classic Jewish terms for Gender Diversity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://transtorah.org/PDFs/Gender_Diversity_In_Halacha.pdf] Gender Diversity in Halakha&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Americas===

====Mesoamerica====

The ancient [[Maya civilization]] may have recognised a third gender, according to historian Matthew Looper. Looper notes the androgynous [[Maize]] Deity and masculine [[Lunar deity|Moon goddess]] of [[Maya mythology]], and iconography and inscriptions where rulers embody or impersonate these deities. He suggests that the third gender could also include two-spirit individuals with special roles such as healers or [[divination|diviners]].&lt;ref&gt;Looper, Matthew G. (2001). ''Ancient Maya Women-Men (and Men-Women): Classic Rulers and the Third Gender'', In: "Ancient Maya Women", ed. Traci Ardren. Walnut Creek, California: Alta Mira, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist and archaeologist Miranda Stockett notes that several writers have felt the need to move beyond a two-gender framework when discussing prehispanic cultures across [[mesoamerica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=40025092 | pages=566–578 | last1=Stockett | first1=M.

Austin, TX: University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and concludes that the [[Olmec]], [[Aztec]] and [[Maya peoples]] understood "more than two kinds of bodies and more than two kinds of gender." Anthropologist Rosemary Joyce agrees, writing that "gender was a fluid potential, not a fixed category, before the Spaniards came to Mesoamerica. Childhood training and ritual shaped, but did not set, adult gender, which could encompass third genders and alternative sexualities as well as "male" and "female." At the height of the Classic period, Maya rulers presented themselves as embodying the entire range of gender possibilities, from male through female, by wearing blended costumes and playing male and female roles in state ceremonies." Joyce notes that many figures of mesoamerican art are depicted with male genitalia and female breasts, while she suggests that other figures in which chests and waists are exposed but no sexual characteristics (primary or secondary) are marked may represent a third sex, ambiguous gender or androgyny.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, Rosemary A.

====Inca====
Andean Studies scholar Michael Horswell writes that third-gendered ritual attendants to ''chuqui chinchay'', a [[jaguar]] deity in [[Incan mythology]], were "vital actors in Andean ceremonies" prior to [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonisation]]. Horswell elaborates: "These ''quariwarmi'' (men-women) [[shaman]]s mediated between the symmetrically dualistic spheres of Andean cosmology and daily life by performing rituals that at times required same-sex erotic practices. Their transvested attire served as a visible sign of a third space that negotiated between the masculine and the feminine, the present and the past, the living and the dead. Their shamanic presence invoked the androgynous creative force often represented in Andean mythology."&lt;ref&gt;Horswell, Michael J. (2006).

{{quote|And in each important temple or house of worship, they have a man or two, or more, depending on the idol, who go dressed in women's attire from the time they are children, and speak like them, and in manner, dress, and everything else they imitate women.

''Sex and Conquest.'' Cornell University Press: Ithaca. p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Illiniwek====
Historically, the [[Illinois Confederation|Indigenous people of Illinois]] have decided the gender of their members based on their childhood behavior. If a male child used tools considered to be "women's tools", such as a spade or ax instead of a bow, they were considered to be third gender, feminine men. The modern, [[Pan-Indianism|pan-Indian]] term for this role is "[[Two-Spirit]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Joyce. 2000. Gender and Power in Prehispanic Mesosamerica. University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

George, Quote: Siva: The Hermaphrodite

The Lord [[Shiva]] is the underlying neutral and changeless reality, the undifferentiated absolute Consciousness, who is the foundation of every change and becoming. The hermaphrodite reality is one which is independent of all distinctions of male and female, the phenomenal and the non-phenomenal, and yet forms the basis of all such distinctions. The Puranas speak of Lord Shiva as the Hermaphrodite reality, though distinctionless within Himself, letting the distinctions of the manifold world spring up from Him. The Puranic thinkers interpreted and represented this hermaphrodite aspect of the Lord Siva in various ways. One such symbol expression is the figure of His Sakti. Another such symbol is the Phallus *(the male reproductive part) and the Yoni (the female reproductive part). A third, a more anthropomorphic metaphor, is that of the union between Siva and His many consorts, such as, Parvati, Uma and others. All these symbolisms express the truth that the variety of this universe stems from the lord Siva through his Sakti. To explain this point very picturesquely, the Puranas apply the mythological story of creation by way of the sexual union between Prajaapati and his daughter to Siva who, by His eternal union with His Sakti creates the world. The Puraanas also use another more sacrificial symbollism to expound the hermaphrodite characteristic of Shiva, according to which the male principle is represented as Fire, the devourer of the offering, and the female principle is the Soma, the devoured offering. In this symbolism, the hermaphrodite is the embodiment of the cosmic sacrifice, through which the universe emerges from the Lord Siva.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the [[common era]], male cults devoted to a goddess that flourished throughout the broad region extending from the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] to [[South Asia]]. While [[galli]] were missionizing the Roman Empire, [[Gala (priests)|kalū]], kurgarrū, and assinnu continued to carry out ancient rites in the temples of Mesopotamia, and the third-gender predecessors of the hijra were clearly evident. It should also be mentioned of the eunuch priests of Artemis at Ephesus; the western Semitic qedeshim, the male "temple prostitutes" known from the Hebrew Bible and Ugaritic texts of the late second millennium; and the keleb, priests of Astarte at Kition and elsewhere. Beyond India, modern ethnographic literature document gender variant shaman-priests throughout [[Southeast Asia]], [[Borneo]], and [[Sulawesi]]. All these roles share the traits of devotion to a goddess, gender transgression and receptive anal sex, ecstatic ritual techniques (for healing, in the case of kalū and Mesopotamian priests, and fertility in the case of hijra), and actual (or symbolic) castration. Most, at some point in their history, were based in temples and, therefore, part of the religious-economic administration of their respective city-states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willsworld.org/priests.html Priests of the Goddess: Gender Transgression in Ancient Religion] by Will Roscoe&lt;/ref&gt;
