{{DISPLAYTITLE:''A priori'' probability}}
An '''''a priori'' probability''' is a probability that is derived purely by [[deductive reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;Mood A.M., Graybill F.A., Boes D.C. (1974) Introduction to the Theory of Statistics (3rd Edition). McGraw-Hill. Section 2.2 ([http://www.colorado.edu/Economics/morey/7818/7818readings.html available online])&lt;/ref&gt; One way of deriving ''a priori'' probabilities is the [[principle of indifference]], which has the character of saying that, if there are ''N'' [[mutually exclusive]] and [[collectively exhaustive]] events and if they are equally likely, then the probability of a given [[event (probability theory)|event]] occurring is 1/''N''. Similarly the probability of one of a given collection of ''K'' events is ''K'' / ''N''.

One disadvantage of defining probabilities in the above way is that it applies only to finite collections of events.

In [[Bayesian inference]], "[[prior probability#Uninformative priors|uninformative priors]]" or "objective priors" are particular choices of ''a priori'' probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. 
Harold J. Price and Allison R. Manson, [http://link.aip.org/link/doi/10.1063/1.1477060 "Uninformative priors for Bayes’ theorem"], ''AIP Conf. Proc. 617, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
Note that "[[prior probability]]" is a broader concept.

Similar to the distinction in philosophy between [[a priori and a posteriori]], in Bayesian inference ''a priori'' denotes general knowledge about the data distribution before making an inference, while ''a posteriori'' denotes knowledge that incorporates the results of making an inference.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Categorization and Machine Learning: The Modeling of Human Understanding in Computers|first=Horst|last=Eidenberger|publisher=Vienna University of Technology|year=2014|isbn=9783735761903|page=109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tmk7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA109}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A priori probability in statistical mechanics==

The a priori probability has an important application in [[statistical mechanics]]. The classical version is defined as the ratio of the number of [[elementary event]]s (e.g. the number of times a die is thrown) to the total number of events. In the case of the die, each elementary event has the same probability—thus the probability of each outcome of throwing a (perfect) die is 1/6. Each face of the die appears with equal probability—probability being a measure defined for each elementary event.

In statistical mechanics, e.g. that of a gas contained in a finite volume &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt;, both the spatial coordinates &lt;math&gt; q_i &lt;/math&gt; and the momentum coordinates &lt;math&gt; p_i &lt;/math&gt; of the individual gas elements (atoms or molecules) are finite in the phase space spanned by these coordinates. In analogy to the case of the die, the a priori probability is here (in the case of a continuum) proportional to the phase space volume element &lt;math&gt; \Delta q\Delta p&lt;/math&gt; divided by &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, and is the number of standing waves (i.e. states) therein, where &lt;math&gt; \Delta q&lt;/math&gt; is the range of the variable &lt;math&gt; q &lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt; \Delta p&lt;/math&gt; is the range of the variable &lt;math&gt; p&lt;/math&gt; (here for simplicity considered in one dimension). In 1 dimension (length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;) this number or statistical weight or a priori weighting  is &lt;math&gt; L \Delta p/h &lt;/math&gt;. In customary 3 dimensions (volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;) the corresponding number can be calculated to be &lt;math&gt;V 4\pi p^2\Delta p/h^3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.J.W. Müller-Kirsten, Basics of Statistical Physics, 2nd. ed. World Scientific (Singapore, 2013), Chapter 6 &lt;/ref&gt;. In view of the [[uncertainty relation]], which in 1 spatial dimension is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta q\Delta p \geq h &lt;/math&gt;,
these states are indistinguishable (i.e. these states do not carry labels). An important consequence is a result known as [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]], i.e. the time independence of this phase space volume element and thus of the a priori probability. A time dependence of this quantity would imply known information about the dynamics of the system, and hence would not be an a priori probability.&lt;ref&gt;A. Ben-Naim, Entropy Demystified, World Scientific (Singapore, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the region
:&lt;math&gt; \Omega:=\frac{\Delta q\Delta p}{\int \Delta q\Delta p},\;\;\;  \int \Delta q\Delta p = const., &lt;/math&gt;
when differentiated with respect to time &lt;math&gt; t&lt;/math&gt; yields zero (with the help of Hamilton's equations): The volume at time &lt;math&gt; t&lt;/math&gt; is the same as at time zero. One describes this also as conservation of information. In quantum mechanics one has an analogous conservation law. In this case, the phase space region is replaced by a subspace of the space of states expressed in terms of a projection operator &lt;math&gt; P&lt;/math&gt;, and instead of the probability in phase space, one has the probability density
:&lt;math&gt; \Sigma: = \frac{P}{Tr P},\;\;\; N = Tr P = const.,&lt;/math&gt;
where  &lt;math&gt; N&lt;/math&gt; is the dimensionality of the subspace. The conservation law in this case is expressed by the unitarity of the [[S-matrix]]. In either case, the considerations assume a closed isolated system.

==Example==
The following example illustrates the a priori probability (or a priori weighting) in (a) classical and (b) quantal contexts.

(a) '''Classical a priori probability'''

Consider the rotational  energy E of a diatomic molecule with moment of inertia I in spherical polar coordinates &lt;math&gt; \theta, \phi&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt; E = \frac{1}{2I}\left(p^2_{\theta} + \frac{p^2_{\phi}}{\sin^2\theta}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The &lt;math&gt;(p_{\theta}, p_{\phi})&lt;/math&gt;-curve for constant E and &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;/math&gt; is an ellipse of area 
:&lt;math&gt;\oint dp_{\theta}dp_{\phi} = \pi \sqrt{2IE}\sqrt{2IE}\sin\theta = 2\pi IE\sin\theta &lt;/math&gt;. 
By integrating over &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi &lt;/math&gt; the total volume of phase space  covered for constant energy E is 
:&lt;math&gt;\int^{\phi=2\pi}_{0}\int^{\theta=\pi}_0 2I\pi E\sin\theta d\theta d\phi = 8\pi^2 IE = \oint dp_{\theta}dp_{\phi}d\theta d\phi&lt;/math&gt;, 
and hence the number of states in the energy range &lt;math&gt;dE &lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega \propto&lt;/math&gt;  (phase space volume at &lt;math&gt;E+dE&lt;/math&gt;) minus  (phase space volume at &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;) is given by &lt;math&gt; 8{\pi}^2 I dE.&lt;/math&gt;

(b) '''Quantal a priori probability'''

Assuming that the number of quantum states in a range &lt;math&gt;\Delta q \Delta p &lt;/math&gt; for each direction of motion is given, per element, by a factor &lt;math&gt;\Delta q\Delta p/h&lt;/math&gt;, the number of states in the energy range dE is, as seen under (a) &lt;math&gt;8\pi^2I dE/h^2 &lt;/math&gt; for the rotating diatomic molecule. From wave mechanics it is known that the energy levels of a
rotating diatomic molecule are given by
:&lt;math&gt; E_n = \frac{n(n+1)h^2}{8\pi^2 I}, &lt;/math&gt;
each such level being (2n+1)-fold degenerate. By evaluating &lt;math&gt;  dn/dE_n=1/dE_n/dn&lt;/math&gt;
one obtains
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dn}{dE_n} = \frac{8\pi^2 I}{(2n+1)h^2}, \;\;\; (2n+1)dn=\frac{8\pi^2 I}{h^2}dE_n.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus by comparison with &lt;math&gt;\Omega &lt;/math&gt; above, one finds that the approximate number of states in the range dE is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \Sigma \propto (2n+1)dn.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of the one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator of natural frequency &lt;math&gt; \nu &lt;/math&gt; one finds correspondingly: (a) &lt;math&gt; \Omega \propto dE/\nu &lt;/math&gt;, and (b) &lt;math&gt; \Sigma \propto dn &lt;/math&gt; (no degeneracy).
Thus in quantum mechanics the a priori probability is effectively a measure of the [[Degeneracy (mathematics)|degeneracy]]. In the case of the hydrogen atom or Coulomb potential (where the evaluation of the phase space volume for constant energy is more complicated) one knows that the quantum mechanical degeneracy is &lt;math&gt; n^2 &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; E\propto 1/n^2 &lt;/math&gt;. Thus in this case &lt;math&gt; \Sigma \propto n^2 dn &lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1870">An '''Alisol''' is a Reference Soil Group of the [[World Reference Base for Soil Resources]] (WRB).

Alisols have an ''argic horizon'', which has a high [[cation exchange capacity]]. In the subsoil, the [[base saturation]] is low.

There exist mixed forms, for example 'Stagnic Alisol', that are mainly Alisol, but also contain components that are found in [[Stagnosol]]s.

Alisols occur in [[tropical climate|tropical]] and [[humid subtropical climate]]s, but are also found in temperate regions.&lt;ref&gt;Chesworth, Ward (editor); ''Encyclopedia of Soil Science''; p. 36. ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to [[Lixisol]]s, [[Acrisol]]s and [[Ferralsol]]s, Alisols have much higher-activity clays and are likely to be found on younger terrains or more geologically active regions such as [[Kyushu]] and [[Chugoku]].

==Agricultural use==
Alisols are acidic (increased by limited drainage) and therefore need liming, contain few nutrients and therefore need fertilizer, and do not have much surface coherence so are easily eroded.

Aluminium and manganese toxicity is a very serious problem in Alisols, because at the low [[pH]] of these soils such generally insoluble metals become soluble and can poison plants which are not tolerant of them. [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] mentions oil palm, cotton, and maize (corn) as crops suitable to be grown on Alisols, though most crops require very intensive fertilisation for long-term success.

The '''Altamuran Revolution''' ({{lang-it|Rivoluzione di Altamura}}, also ''Rivoluzione altamurana'') was a three month period of self-government of Italian town [[Altamura]], right after the birth of the [[Parthenopean Republic]] (23 January 1799) which ousted the Bourbons and the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. The city of the Kingdom of Naples was then defeated and taken by the so-called [[Sanfedisti]], led by cardinal [[Fabrizio Ruffo]], after a battle on the city walls. After being defeated, most Altamurans managed to flee from ''porta Bari'', one of Altamura's main gates.

In February 1799, the news that the king had fled to [[Palermo]] arrived in Altamura. Altamura population then reorganized and embraced the ideals propagated by the [[French Revolution]]. The [[Arbre de la liberté|Liberty Tree]] was also planted in what it was then called ''piazza del mercato'' (today it's called ''piazza Duomo''). In the meantime, the [[Sanfedisti]],led by the cardinal [[Fabrizio Ruffo]], were getting closer and closer, determined to restore the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Bourbons]] dynasty. [[Sanfedisti]] left Matera and arrived at the gates of Altamura on 9 May 1799. Altamura had already fixed everything before the battle, by closing the secondary city gates, fusing the church bells in order to make new cannons and preparing ammunition. On 9 May, the battle took place, but soon Altamurans ran off of ammunition and they started to shoot coins. This let the enemy realize that the situation inside the city was critical and that they wouldn't last for long. On the night of 9 May  1799, most Altamurans managed to escape from ''porta Bari'' (perhaps accidentally or thanks to [[Fabrizio Ruffo | Ruffo]] unbeknown to his troops). On the morning of 10 May, [[Sanfedisti]] entered Altamura, sacking and slaughtering an unknown number of Altamurans who had remained there. The stay of [[Sanfedisti]] and [[Ruffo]] inside the city lasted 14 days, during which Altamurans gradually returned and some of them were killed or imprisoned. By the end of May 1799, the situation had already normalized and Altamura had returned under the full control of the [[Kingdom of Naples]].

The number of deaths among [[Sanfedisti]] has been estimated at around 1,400 people, but it is not clear how many [[Altamurans]] were killed. Some historians estimated the losses among Altamurans from about forty to a hundred people, while other historians suggested that many Altamurans and [[Naples|Neapolitan]] [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin]] people from other cities may have been counted as Sanfedisti. In this case, the death toll among Altamurans and Parthenopean Republicans would be much higher.

An air temperature of {{convert|−75|°F|°C}} or below would meet the criteria for Condition 2.  And an air temperature of {{convert|−100|°F|°C}} or colder would meet the criteria for Condition 1.  However, the coldest temperature ever recorded at McMurdo Station was {{convert|−51.7|°C|°F}}.  So reaching {{convert|−75|°F|°C}} would be unlikely to occur, and reaching {{convert|−100|°F|°C}} would be virtually impossible.  However, reaching Condition 2 based on windchill values of {{convert|−75|°F|°C}} or below do happen.  And reaching Condition 1 based on windchill values of {{convert|−100|°F|°C}} or colder does occur.

In [[psychology]], '''apprehension''' (Lat. ''ad'', "to"; ''prehendere'', "to seize") is a term applied to a [[mental model|model]] of [[consciousness]] in which nothing is affirmed or denied of the object in question, but the [[mind]] is merely aware of ("seizes") it.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Apprehension|volume=2|pages=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Judgment" (says Reid, ed. Hamilton, i. p.&amp;nbsp;414) "is an act of the mind, specifically different from simple apprehension or the bare conception of a thing". "Simple apprehension or conception can neither be true nor false." This distinction provides for the large class of [[mental function|mental acts]] in which we are simply aware of, or "take in" a number of familiar objects, about which we in general make no judgment, unless our attention is suddenly called by a new feature. Or again, two alternatives may be apprehended without any resultant judgment as to their respective merits.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Similarly, [[George Stout|G.F. Stout]] stated that while we have a very vivid idea of a [[fictional character|character]] or an incident in a work of [[fiction]], we can hardly be said in any real sense to have any [[belief]] or to make any judgment as to its [[existence]] or [[truth]]. With this mental state may be compared the purely [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] [[contemplation]] of [[music]], wherein apart from, say, a false [[Musical note|note]], the [[wikt:faculty|faculty]] of judgment is for the time inoperative. To these examples may be added the fact that one can fully understand an argument in all its bearings, without in any way judging its [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. Without going into the question fully, it may be pointed out that the distinction between judgment and apprehension is relative. In every kind of thought, there is judgment of some sort in a greater or less degree of prominence.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Judgment and [[thought]] are in fact [[psychologically]] distinguishable merely as different, though [[correlation|correlative]], activities of consciousness. Professor Stout further investigates the phenomena of apprehension, and comes to the conclusion that "it is possible to distinguish and identify a whole without apprehending any of its [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] details." On the other hand, if the attention focuses itself for a time on the apprehended object, there is an expectation that such details will, as it were, emerge into consciousness. Hence, he describes such apprehension as "[[implication (pragmatics)|implicit]]", and insofar as the implicit apprehension determines the order of such emergence, he describes it as "[[schematic]]".&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

A good example of this process is the use of [[formula]]e in calculations; ordinarily the formula is used without question; if attention is fixed upon it, the steps by which it is shown to be [[universalism|universally]] applicable emerge, and the "schema " is complete in detail. With this result may be compared [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s theory of apprehension as a synthetic act (the "synthesis of apprehension") by which the sensory elements of a [[perception]] are subjected to the formal conditions of [[time]] and [[space]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''Bernard S. Benson''' (28 January 1922 – 15 May 1996) was an inventor and British author and writer of ''The Peace Book''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Cv4hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7qQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1316,3462405&amp;dq=bernard-benson+the-peace-book&amp;hl=en|title=Greene acquires a Canadian publisher |date=30 January 1982|publisher=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|''Montreal Gazette'']]|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a fighter pilot during World War II, and later worked on the design of early British missiles. He emigrated to the United States where at Douglas Aircraft Co., in Santa Monica, CA, he worked on the Douglas F4D Delta wing fighter and various Douglas missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Social Security Death Index|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VSVY-X44|publisher=familysearch|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the 1950s, he founded [[Benson-Lehner Corporation]] with George F. G. Lehner, a psychology professor at UCLA.  Soon after its founding, futurist [[Donald Prell]] joined the company as Vice President, Application Engineering.  The new company was successful, as it filled a niche designing systems that were used to provide data input and output to and from the early computers.  The B/L machines semi-automatically read oscillograph and photographic flight test data producing punched tape and IBM punch cards which were then entered into computers.  After being processed, the data was then automatically printed on large flatbed graph-plotters.  This process automated the formerly manual reading and subsequent hand-plotting of data.  B/L plotters soon became the industry standard, and were sold worldwide. After an [[IPO]] the company expanded into the field of high speed photography.  Two photo-mechanical engineers, Guy Hearon and Harry Katt, were hired, who designed a series of 16mm, 35mm, and 70mm high speed cameras and accessories.

In 1961, Benson was one of the first persons to warn against the privacy risks raised by computers, claiming that digital data could one day be fed into a single system, leaving individuals at the mercy "of who or what controls the machine".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in: Fuster, Gloria González. 2014. The Emergence of Personal Data Protection as a Fundamental Right of the EU. Springer Science &amp; Business. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:B.Benson.JPG|thumb|left|Bernard Benson whilst living in France]]

Early in the 1960s, Benson retired and moved to France, where he purchased the Chateau de Chaban located in the Dordogne.  While living there with his first wife Jane Lysbeth Saville Sneath and their seven children, he began writing children's books based on the philosophy of a group of Tibetan monks, who shared his estate.  Benson tried to make their philosophy readily understandable to both young and old. He then married Maryse Lheureux and had three daughters.

Books that were published included: ''The Minstrel'', an allegorical story about Elvis Presley, ''Alice in Plunderland'', ''Strictly Birdsmanship (or how to lay the egg that kills the golden goose)'', and  ''On Being an Egghead; or Engineersmanship for the Shell of it''.

A '''biordered set''' ("boset") is a [[mathematical object]] that occurs in the description of the  [[structure]] of the set of [[idempotent]]s in a [[semigroup]]. The concept and the terminology were developed by [[K S S Nambooripad]] in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nambooripad|first=K S S|title=Structure of regular semigroups|publisher=[[University of Kerala]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[India]]|date=1973|isbn=0-8218-2224-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF02194864|last=Nambooripad|first=K S S|date=1975|title=Structure of regular semigroups I . Fundamental regular semigroups|journal=[[Semigroup Forum]]|volume=9|issue=4|pages=354–363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="namb"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nambooripad|first=K S S|title=Structure of regular semigroups – I|publisher=American Mathematical Society|date=1979|series=Memoirs of the American Mathematical Society|volume=224|isbn=978-0-8218-2224-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The defining properties of a biordered set are expressed in terms of two [[quasiorder]]s defined on the set and hence the name biordered set. Patrick Jordan, while a master's student at University of   Sydney, introduced in 2002 the term '''boset'''  as an abbreviation of biordered set.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick K. Jordan. ''On biordered sets, including an alternative approach to fundamental regular semigroups''. Master’s thesis, University of Sydney, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mohan S. Putcha, "The axioms defining a biordered set are quite complicated. However, considering the general nature of semigroups, it is rather surprising that such a finite axiomatization is even possible."&lt;ref name="putcha"&gt;{{cite book|last=Putcha|first=Mohan S|title=Linear algebraic monoids|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1988|series=London Mathematical Society Lecture Note Series|volume=133|pages=121–122|isbn=978-0-521-35809-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the publication of the original definition of the biordered set by Nambooripad, several variations in the definition have been proposed. [[David Easdown]] simplified the definition and formulated the axioms in a special arrow notation invented by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Easdown|first=David|date=1984|title=Biordered sets are biordered subsets of idempotents of semigroups|journal=Journal of Australian Mathematical Society|volume=Series A, 32|issue=2|pages=258–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The set of idempotents in a semigroup is a biordered set and every biordered set is the set of idempotents of some semigroup.&lt;ref name="namb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0021-8693(85)90028-6|last=Easdown|first=David|date=1985|title=Biordered sets come from semigroups|journal=Journal of Algebra|volume=96|pages=581–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A regular biordered set is a biordered set with an additional  property. The set of idempotents in a [[regular semigroup]]  is a regular biordered set, and  every  regular biordered set is the set of idempotents of some regular semigroup.&lt;ref name="namb"/&gt;  
 
== Definition ==
The formal definition of a biordered set given by Nambooripad&lt;ref name="namb"/&gt; requires some preliminaries. 

=== Preliminaries ===

If ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and  ρ⊆ ''X'' × ''Y'', let ρ ( ''y'' ) = { ''x'' ∈ ''X'' : ''x'' ρ ''y'' }. 
  
Let ''E''  be a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] in which  a [[Partial function|partial]] [[binary operation]], indicated by juxtaposition, is defined.  If ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]] of the partial binary operation on ''E'' then ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] on ''E'' and (''e'',''f'') is in  ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt;  if and only if the product ''ef'' exists in ''E''. The following relations can be defined in ''E'':

:&lt;math&gt;\omega^r = \{(e,f) \, :\, fe = e\}  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\omega^l = \{ (e,f)\, :\, ef = e \}  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; R = \omega^r\, \cap \, (\omega^r)^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; L = \omega^l\, \cap \, (\omega^l)^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \omega = \omega^r \, \cap \, \omega^l &lt;/math&gt;

If ''T'' is any [[Proposition (mathematics)|statement]] about ''E'' involving the partial binary operation and the above relations in ''E'', one can define the left-right [[Dual (mathematics)|dual]] of ''T'' denoted by ''T''*. If ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] then ''T''* is meaningful whenever ''T'' is. 

=== Formal definition ===

The set ''E''  is called a biordered set if the following [[axiom]]s and their duals hold for arbitrary elements ''e'', ''f'', ''g'', etc. in ''E''.

:(B1)&amp;#8195; ω&lt;sup&gt;''r'' &lt;/sup&gt;   and ω&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt;  are [[Reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[Transitive relation|transitive]] relations on ''E'' and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt; = ( ω&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; ∪ ω &lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt; ) ∪ ( ω&lt;sup&gt;''r ''&lt;/sup&gt; ∪ ω&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

:(B21)&amp;#8194; If ''f'' is in ω&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;( ''e'' ) then ''f R fe '' ω ''e''.  

:(B22)&amp;#8194; If ''g'' ω&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt; ''f'' and if ''f'' and ''g'' are in ω&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; ( ''e'' ) then ''ge'' ω&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt; ''fe''.

:(B31)&amp;#8194; If ''g'' ω&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; ''f'' and ''f'' ω&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; ''e'' then ''gf'' = ( ''ge'' )''f''.

:(B32)&amp;#8194; If ''g'' ω&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt; ''f'' and if ''f'' and ''g'' are in ω&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; ( ''e'' ) then ( ''fg'' )''e'' = ( ''fe'' )( ''ge'' ).

In ''M'' ( ''e'', ''f'' ) = ω&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt; ( ''e'' ) ∩ ω&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; ( ''f'' ) (the '''''M''-set''' of ''e'' and ''f'' in that order), define a relation &lt;math&gt;\prec&lt;/math&gt; by 

:&lt;math&gt;g \prec h\quad \Longleftrightarrow  \quad eg \,\,\omega^r\,\, eh\,,\,\,\,   gf\,\, \omega^l \,\,hf&lt;/math&gt;.  

Then the set

:&lt;math&gt; S(e,f) = \{ h\in M(e,f) : g\prec h \text{ for all } g\in M(e,f) \} &lt;/math&gt;

is called the '''sandwich set''' of ''e'' and ''f'' in that order. 

:(B4)&amp;#8195; If ''f'' and ''g'' are in ω&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; ( ''e'' ) then ''S''( ''f'', ''g'' )''e'' = ''S'' ( ''fe'', ''ge'' ).

=== ''M''-biordered sets and regular biordered sets ===

We say that a biordered set ''E'' is an '''''M''-biordered set''' if ''M'' ( ''e'', ''f'' ) ≠ ∅ for all ''e'' and ''f'' in ''E''.  
Also, ''E'' is called a  '''regular biordered set''' if ''S'' ( ''e'', ''f'' ) ≠ ∅ for all ''e'' and ''f'' in ''E''.

In 2012 Roman S. Gigoń gave a simple proof that ''M''-biordered sets arise from [[E-inversive semigroup|''E''-inversive semigroup]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gigoń, Roman (2012). "Some results on ''E''-inversive semigroups". Quasigroups and Related Systems '''20''': 53-60.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=August 2014}}

== Subobjects and morphisms ==
=== Biordered subsets ===
A subset ''F''  of a biordered set ''E''  is a biordered subset (subboset) of ''E'' if ''F'' is a biordered set under the partial binary operation inherited from ''E''. 

For any ''e'' in ''E'' the sets ω&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; ( ''e'' ),  ω&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt; ( ''e'' ) and ω  ( ''e'' ) are biordered subsets of ''E''.&lt;ref name="namb"/&gt;

=== Bimorphisms ===

A mapping φ : ''E'' → ''F'' between two biordered sets ''E'' and ''F'' is a biordered set  homomorphism (also called a bimorphism) if for all ( ''e'', ''f'' ) in ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt; we have ( ''e''φ ) ( ''f''φ ) = ( ''ef'' )φ.

== Illustrative examples ==
=== Vector space example ===

Let ''V'' be a [[vector space]] and 

:''E'' =  { ( ''A'', ''B'' ) | ''V'' =  ''A''  ⊕  ''B'' }

where ''V''  = ''A''  ⊕  ''B''  means that ''A'' and ''B'' are [[Linear subspace|subspaces]] of ''V'' and ''V'' is the  [[internal direct sum]] of ''A'' and ''B''. 
The partial binary operation ⋆ on E defined by 

:( ''A'', ''B'' ) ⋆ ( ''C'', ''D'' ) = ( ''A'' + ( ''B'' ∩ ''C'' ), ( ''B'' + ''C'' ) ∩ ''D '') 

makes ''E'' a biordered set. The quasiorders in ''E'' are characterised as follows: 

:( ''A'', ''B'' ) ω&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; ( ''C'', ''D'' ) ⇔ ''A'' ⊇ ''C''
:( ''A'', ''B'' ) ω&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt; ( ''C'', ''D'' ) ⇔ ''B'' ⊆ ''D''

=== Biordered set of a semigroup ===

The set ''E'' of idempotents in a semigroup ''S'' becomes a biordered set if a partial binary operation is defined in ''E'' as follows: ''ef'' is defined in ''E'' if and only if ''ef'' = ''e'' or ''ef''= ''f'' or ''fe'' = ''e'' or ''fe'' = ''f'' holds in ''S''. If ''S'' is a regular semigroup then ''E'' is a regular biordered set.

As a concrete example, let ''S'' be the semigroup of all mappings of ''X'' = { 1, 2, 3 } into itself. Let the symbol (''abc'') denote the map for which 1 → ''a'',  2 → ''b'', and 3 → ''c''. The set ''E'' of idempotents in ''S'' contains the following elements:

:(111), (222), (333)  (constant maps)

:(122), (133), (121), (323), (113), (223)

:(123) (identity map)

The following table (taking composition of mappings in the diagram order) describes the partial binary operation in ''E''. An '''X''' in a cell indicates that the corresponding multiplication is not defined.

{{Emotion}}
In conventional usage, '''boredom''' is an [[emotion]]al and occasionally [[psychology|psychological]] state experienced when an individual is left without anything in particular to do, is not interested in his or her surroundings, or feels that a day or period is dull or tedious. It is also understood by scholars as a modern phenomenon which has a cultural dimension. "There is no universally accepted definition of boredom. But whatever it is, researchers argue, it is not simply another name for depression or apathy. It seems to be a specific mental state that people find unpleasant—a lack of stimulation that leaves them craving relief, with a host of behavioural, medical and social consequences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-boredom-is-anything-but-boring/|title=Why Boredom Is Anything but Boring|first=Maggie Koerth-Baker,Nature|last=magazine|date=|website=scientificamerican.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608101457/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-boredom-is-anything-but-boring/|archivedate=8 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to BBC  News, boredom "...can be a dangerous and disruptive state of mind that damages your health"; yet research "...suggest[s] that without boredom we couldn't achieve our creative feats."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20141218-why-boredom-is-good-for-you|title=Psychology: Why boredom is bad... and good for you|first=David|last=Robson|date=|website=bbc.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824121704/http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20141218-why-boredom-is-good-for-you|archivedate=24 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Experience Without Qualities: Boredom and Modernity'', Elizabeth Goodstein traces the modern discourse on boredom through literary, philosophical, and sociological texts to find that as "a discursively articulated phenomenon...boredom is at once objective and subjective, emotion and intellectualization — not just a response to the modern world but also a historically constituted strategy for coping with its discontents."&lt;ref&gt;Goodstein, Elizabeth S. 2005. Experience Without Qualities: Boredom and Modernity. Stanford: Stanford University Press. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In both conceptions, boredom has to do fundamentally with an experience of time and problems of meaning.

==Etymology and terminology==
The expression ''to be a bore'' had been used in print in the sense of "to be tiresome or dull" since 1768 at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=b&amp;p=27 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2013-12-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213061635/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=b&amp;p=27 |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression "boredom" means "state of being bored," 1852, from bore (v.1) + -dom. It also has been employed in a sense "bores as a class" (1883) and "practice of being a bore" (1864, a sense properly belonging to boreism, 1833).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=boredom |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2015-12-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222163157/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=boredom |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "bore" as a noun meaning a "thing which causes ennui or annoyance" is attested to since 1778; "of persons by 1812". The noun "bore" comes from the verb "bore", which had the meaning "[to] be tiresome or dull" first attested [in] 1768, a vogue word c. 1780-81 according to Grose (1785); possibly a figurative extension of "to move forward slowly and persistently, as a [hole-] boring tool does."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=bore |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2015-12-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222150953/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=bore |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French term for boredom, '''''ennui''''', is sometimes used in English as well, at least since 1778. The term ''ennui'' was first used "as a French word in English;" in the 1660s and it was "nativized by 1758".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ennui|title=ennui - Origin and meaning of ennui by Online Etymology Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216052339/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ennui|archivedate=16 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''ennui'' comes "from French ennui, from Old French enui "annoyance" (13c.), [a] back-formation from enoiier, anuier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ennui|title=ennui - Origin and meaning of ennui by Online Etymology Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216052339/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ennui|archivedate=16 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The German word for "boredom" expresses this: ''[[wikt:Langeweile|Langeweile]]'', a compound made of ''lange'' "long" and ''Weile'' "while", which is in line with the common perception that when one is bored, time passes "tortuously" slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us|title=News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's US edition|author=|date=|website=the Guardian|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425213521/https://www.theguardian.com/us|archivedate=25 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different scholars use different definitions of ''boredom'', which complicates research.&lt;ref&gt;Vodanovich, Stephen J.  (November 2003) "[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2f48/fb5444550d14c5b4a09e5a54d2a312221233.pdf Psychometric Measures of Boredom: A Review of the Literature]"  ''The Journal of Psychology''. '''137''':6 p. 569  "Indeed, a shortcoming of the boredom literature is the absence of a coherent, universally accepted definition. The lack of an agreed-upon definition of boredom has limited the measurement of the construct and partly accounts for the existence of diverse approaches to assessing various subsets of boredom."&lt;/ref&gt;  Boredom has been defined by Cynthia D. Fisher in terms of its main central [[psychological]] processes: "an unpleasant, transient [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] state in which the individual feels a pervasive lack of [[interest (emotion)|interest]] and difficulty concentrating on the current activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fisher|1993|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Leary]] et al. describe boredom as "an affective experience associated with cognitive attentional processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.51.5.968 |author1=Leary, M.

There are three types of boredom, all of which involve problems of engagement of [[attention]]. These include times when we are prevented from engaging in wanted activity, when we are forced to engage in unwanted activity, or when we are simply unable for no apparent reason to maintain engagement in any activity or spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.concog.2005.11.009 |author1=Cheyne, J.

[[Absent-mindedness]] is where a person shows inattentive or forgetful behaviour.&lt;ref name=ODam&gt;{{cite web|title=absent-minded|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/absent-minded|publisher=Oxford dictionaries|accessdate=5 August 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908132137/http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/absent-minded|archivedate=8 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Absent-mindedness is a mental condition in which the subject experiences low levels of [[attention]] and frequent distraction. Absent-mindedness is not a diagnosed condition but rather a symptom of boredom and sleepiness which people experience in their daily lives. When suffering from absent-mindedness, people tend to show signs of memory lapse and weak recollection of recently occurring events. This can usually be a result of a variety of other conditions often diagnosed by clinicians such as [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. In addition to absent-mindedness leading to an array of consequences affecting daily life, it can have as more severe, long-term problems.

==Physical health==
[[Lethargy]] is a state of tiredness, weariness, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], or lack of energy. It can be accompanied by depression, decreased motivation, or apathy. Lethargy can be a normal response to boredom, inadequate sleep, overexertion, overworking, stress, lack of exercise, or a symptom of a disorder. When part of a normal response, lethargy often resolves with rest, adequate sleep, decreased stress, and good nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/symptom/lethargy|title=Lethargy: Causes, Symptoms and Diagnosis|author=|date=|website=www.healthline.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121080553/https://www.healthline.com/symptom/lethargy|archivedate=21 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall J.

==Philosophy==
Boredom is a condition characterized by [[perception]] of one's environment as dull, tedious, and lacking in [[stimulation]].  This can result from leisure and a lack of aesthetic interests.  [[Labour economics|Labor]] and [[art]] may be alienated and passive, or immersed in tedium. There is an inherent [[anxiety]] in boredom; people will expend considerable effort to prevent or remedy it, yet in many circumstances, it is accepted as suffering to be endured. Common passive ways to escape boredom are to sleep or to think creative thoughts ([[daydream]]).  Typical active solutions consist in an intentional activity of some sort, often something new, as familiarity and [[wikt:repetition|repetition]] lead to the tedious.

During the [[fin de siècle]], the French term for the end of the 19th century in the West, some of the cultural hallmarks included "ennui", [[cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]], [[pessimism]], and "...a widespread belief that civilization leads to [[decadence]]."&lt;ref&gt;Meštrović, Stjepan G.  ''The Coming Fin de Siecle: An Application of Durkheim's Sociology to modernity and postmodernism.'' Oxon, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge (1992 [1991]: 2). Pireddu, Nicoletta. "Primitive marks of modernity: cultural reconfigurations in the Franco-Italian fin de siècle," _Romanic Review_, 97 (3-4), 2006: 371-400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boredom also plays a role in [[existentialism|existentialist]] thought. [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] were two of the first philosophers considered fundamental to the existentialist movement. Like [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], they were interested in people's quiet struggle with the apparent meaninglessness of life and the use of diversion to escape from boredom. Kierkegaard's ''[[Either/Or]]'' describes the [[rotation method]], a method used by higher level aesthetes in order to avoid boredom. The method is an essential [[hedonism|hedonistic]] aspect of the aesthetic way of life. For the aesthete, one constantly changes what one is doing in order to maximize the enjoyment and pleasure derived from each activity.

In contexts where one is confined, spatially or otherwise, boredom may be met with various religious activities, not because religion would want to associate itself with tedium, but rather, partly because boredom may be taken as the essential human condition, to which God, wisdom, or morality are the ultimate answers. It is taken in this sense by virtually all existentialist philosophers as well as by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].

[[Martin Heidegger]] wrote about boredom in two texts available in English, in the 1929/30 semester lecture course ''The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics'', and again in the essay ''What is Metaphysics?'' published in the same year. In the lecture, Heidegger included about 100 pages on boredom, probably the most extensive philosophical treatment ever of the subject. He focused on waiting at [[railway station]]s in particular as a major context of boredom.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger. ''The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics'', pp. 78–164.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Søren Kierkegaard]] remarks in ''[[Either/Or]]'' that "patience cannot be depicted" visually, since there is a sense that any immediate moment of life may be fundamentally tedious.

[[Blaise Pascal]] in the ''[[Pensées]]'' discusses the human condition in saying "we seek rest in a struggle against some obstacles. And when we have overcome these, rest proves unbearable because of the boredom it produces", and later states that "only an infinite and immutable object – that is, God himself – can fill this infinite abyss."&lt;ref name="Pensées"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Pensées | url = https://books.google.com/?id=DdlNuvGMPisC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Blaise+Pascal%22 | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-87220-717-2 | last1 = Pascal| first1 =  Blaise |last2 =  Ariew| first2 =  Roger | accessdate = 2009-07-27 | publisher = Hackett Pub. Co. | location = Indianapolis, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without stimulus or focus, the individual is confronted with [[nothing]]ness, the meaninglessness of existence, and experiences existential [[anxiety]]. Heidegger states this idea as follows: "Profound boredom, drifting here and there in the abysses of our existence like a muffling fog, removes all things and men and oneself along with it into a remarkable indifference. This boredom reveals being as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''What is Metaphysics?'' (1929)&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer used the existence of boredom in an attempt to prove the [[vanity]] of human existence, stating, "...for if life, in the desire for which our essence and existence consists, possessed in itself a positive value and real content, there would be no such thing as boredom: mere existence would fulfil and satisfy us."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, Essays and Aphorisms, Penguin Classics, {{ISBN|0-14-044227-8}} (2004), p53 Full text available online: [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0140442278&amp;id=AZUe_0tOZIUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=e-esU4GaO5&amp;dq=arthur+schopenhauer+books&amp;sig=Jze2WQysljLWFYQKTr_Oh-UHsE0 Google Books Search]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erich Fromm]] and other thinkers of [[critical theory]] speak of boredom as a common psychological response to industrial society, where people are required to engage in [[alienated labor]]. According to Fromm, boredom is "perhaps the most important source of aggression and destructiveness today." For Fromm, the search for thrills and novelty that characterizes consumer culture are not solutions to boredom, but mere distractions from boredom which, he argues, continues unconsciously.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Fromm]], [http://www.erich-fromm.de/data/pdf/1972c-e.pdf "Theory of Aggression"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513020501/http://www.erich-fromm.de/data/pdf/1972c-e.pdf |date=May 13, 2011 }} pg.7&lt;/ref&gt; Above and beyond taste and character, the universal case of boredom consists in any instance of ''waiting'', as Heidegger noted, such as in line, for someone else to arrive or finish a task, or while one is travelling somewhere. The automobile requires fast reflexes, making its operator busy and hence, perhaps for other reasons as well, making the ride more tedious despite being over sooner. 

Interestingly, in some [[Nguni languages|Nguni]] languages such as [[Zulu language|Zulu]], boredom and loneliness are represented by the same word (isizungu). This adds a new dimension to the oft-quoted definition of [[Ubuntu philosophy|ubuntu]]: "A person is a person through other people".

Although it has not been widely studied, research on boredom suggests that boredom is a major factor impacting diverse areas of a person's life. People ranked low on a boredom-proneness scale were found to have better performance in a wide variety of aspects of their lives, including career, education, and autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Watt, J. D. |author2=Vodanovich, S. J. |title=Boredom Proneness and Psychosocial Development |journal=Journal of Psychology |volume=133 |issue=1 |pages=149–155 |year=1999 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(200001)56:1&lt;149::AID-JCLP14&gt;3.0.CO;2-Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boredom can be a symptom of [[clinical depression]]. Boredom can be a form of [[learned helplessness]], a phenomenon closely related to depression. Some philosophies of [[parenting]] propose that if children are raised in an environment devoid of [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], and are not allowed or encouraged to interact with their environment, they will fail to develop the mental capacities to do so.

In a learning environment, a common cause of boredom is lack of understanding; for instance, if one is not following or connecting to the material in a class or lecture, it will usually seem boring. However, the opposite can also be true; something that is too easily understood, simple or transparent, can also be boring. Boredom is often inversely related to [[learning]], and in school it may be a sign that a student is not challenged enough, or too challenged. An activity that is predictable to the students is likely to bore them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=ED397840 Ed.gov] – R.V. Small et al.  ''Dimensions of Interest and Boredom in Instructional Situations'', Proceedings of Selected Research and Development Presentations at the 1996 National Convention of the Association for Educational Communications and Technology (18th, Indianapolis, IN), (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1989 study indicated that an individual's impression of boredom may be influenced by the individual's degree of [[attention]], as a higher acoustic level of distraction from the environment correlated with higher reportings of boredom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Damrad-Frye| first = R|author2=Laird JD| title = The experience of boredom: the role of the self-perception of attention| year = 1989| journal = J Personality Social Psych| volume = 57| pages = 315–20| doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.57.2.315| issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boredom has been studied as being related to [[drug abuse]] among teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Iso-Ahola, Seppo E. |author2=Crowley, Edward D. |title=Adolescent Substance Abuse and Leisure Boredom |journal=Journal of Leisure Research |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=260–71 |year=1991 |url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=EJ429375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boredom has been proposed as a cause of [[pathological gambling]] behavior.

==In the workplace==
{{Main article|Boreout}}
[[Boreout]] is a [[management theory]] that posits that lack of work, boredom, and consequent lack of satisfaction are a common malaise affecting individuals working in modern organizations, especially in office-based white collar jobs. This theory was first expounded in 2007 in ''Diagnose Boreout'', a book by Peter Werder and Philippe Rothlin, two Swiss business consultants. They claim the absence of meaningful tasks, rather than the presence of stress, is many workers' chief problem.

A "[[banishment room]]" (also known as a "chasing-out-room" and a "boredom room") is a modern [[employee exit management]] strategy whereby employees are transferred to a department where they are assigned meaningless work until they become disheartened enough to quit.&lt;ref name=Torres&gt;{{cite news|last=Torres|first=Ida|title=Japanese companies using 'banishment rooms' to push employees to resign|url=http://japandailypress.com/japanese-companies-using-banishment-rooms-to-push-employees-to-resign-3029793/|accessdate=24 August 2013|newspaper=Japan Daily Press|date=May 30, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815050741/http://japandailypress.com/japanese-companies-using-banishment-rooms-to-push-employees-to-resign-3029793/|archivedate=15 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ASAHI&gt;{{cite news|title=BANISHMENT ROOM: Top companies under investigation over unfair labor practices |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201301290071 |accessdate=23 August 2013 |newspaper=THE ASAHI SHIMBUN |date=January 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919011307/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201301290071 |archivedate=19 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TABUCHI&gt;{{cite news|last=TABUCHI|first=HIROKO|title=Layoffs Taboo, Japan Workers Are Sent to the Boredom Room|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/17/business/global/layoffs-illegal-japan-workers-are-sent-to-the-boredom-room.html|accessdate=23 August 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 16, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822220641/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/17/business/global/layoffs-illegal-japan-workers-are-sent-to-the-boredom-room.html|archivedate=22 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the resignation is voluntary, the employee would not be eligible for certain benefits. The legality and ethics of the practice is questionable and may be construed as [[constructive dismissal]] by the courts in some regions.

==In popular culture==
"[[Meh]]" is an [[interjection]] used as an expression of [[Indifference (emotion)|indifference]] or boredom. It may also mean "be it as it may".&lt;ref name=zimmer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2013/09/06/meh_etymology_tracing_the_yiddish_word_from_leo_rosten_to_auden_to_the_simpsons.html |title=A History of Meh, from Leo Rosten to Auden to The Simpsons |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |author=[[Benjamin Zimmer]] |date=September 6, 2013 |accessdate=February 26, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228041933/http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2013/09/06/meh_etymology_tracing_the_yiddish_word_from_leo_rosten_to_auden_to_the_simpsons.html |archivedate=February 28, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often regarded as a verbal shrug of the shoulders.

{{Main article|Superfluous man}}
The superfluous man ({{lang-ru|лишний человек}}, ''lishniy chelovek'') is an 1840s and 1850s Russian literary concept derived from the [[Byronic hero]].&lt;ref name=c1&gt;{{Harvnb|Chances|2001|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to an individual, perhaps talented and capable, who does not fit into social norms. In most cases, this person is born into wealth and privilege.  Typical characteristics are disregard for social values, [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]], and [[Existentialism|existential]] boredom; typical behaviors are gambling, drinking, smoking, sexual intrigues, and [[duel]]s.  He is often unempathetic and carelessly distresses others with his actions.

The '''British National Vegetation Classification''' or '''NVC''' is a system of classifying [[nature|natural]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] types in [[Great Britain]] according to the [[vegetation]] they contain.

A large scientific meeting of [[ecologist]]s, [[botanist]]s, and other related professionals in the [[United Kingdom]] resulted in the publication of a compendium of five books: ''[[British Plant Communities]]'', edited by [[John S. Rodwell]], which detail the incidence of plant species in twelve major habitat types in the British [[natural environment]].&lt;ref name="Rodwell"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[British Plant Communities]] |isbn=0521797160|editor-first=John S. |editor-last=Rodwell |editor-link=John S. Rodwell|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1998–2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the first systematic and comprehensive account of the [[vegetation]] types of the country. They cover all natural, semi-natural and major artificial habitats in Great Britain (not [[Northern Ireland]]) and represent fifteen years of research by leading plant [[ecology|ecologists]].

From the data collated from the books, commercial [[software]] products have been developed to help to classify vegetation identified into one of the many habitat types found in Great Britain – these include ''MATCH'', ''TABLEFIT'' and ''MAVIS''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/pdf/jncc335.pdf |title=National Vegetation Classification – Ten years’ experience using the woodland section |editor-first=E |editor-last=Goldberg |publisher=[[Joint Nature Conservation Committee|JNCC]] |date=April 2001}} citing:

== Terminology used in connection with the British National Vegetation Classification ==

The following is a list of terms used in connection with the British National Vegetation Classification, together with their meanings:

=== Communities, subcommunities and variants ===

*A '''community''' is the fundamental unit of categorisation for vegetation.
*A '''subcommunity''' is a distinct recognisable subdivision of a community.
*A '''variant''' is a further subdivision of a subcommunity.

=== Constant species ===

*A '''constant species''' in a community is a species that is always present in any given stand of vegetation belonging to that community.

For a list of the constant species, and the NVC communities in which they are present, see [[List of constant species in the British National Vegetation Classification]].

=== Rare species ===

*A '''rare species''' is a species which is associated with a particular community and is rare nationally.

:The sources used by the authors of ''[[British Plant Communities]]'' for assessing rarity were as follows. 
:a) for [[vascular plant]]s, two sources were used:
::*Perring, F. H. and S. M. Walters (1962) ''[[Atlas of the British Flora]]'' - a species was regarded as rare if it was given an "A" rating in this work (these were plants which Perring &amp; Walters judged to be sufficiently rare to merit a special search in order to ensure all records were included in the atlas).
::*Any species included on lists compiled by the [[Nature Conservancy Council]] of plants found in less than 100 [[hectad]]s.

:b) for [[bryophyte]]s, the source used was Corley, M. F. V. and M. O. Hill (1981) ''Distribution of bryophytes in the British Isles''. This lists the species and the [[vice-county|vice-counties]] in which they are recorded; presence in under 20 vice-counties was the criterion used for selection as rare.

:c) for [[lichen]]s, no source was available, and the authors used their own selection of species.

For a list of these rare species, and the NVC communities in which they are present, see [[List of rare species in the British National Vegetation Classification]].

== Communities by category ==

In total there are 286 communities in the British National Vegetation Classification. They are grouped into the following major categories:

* [[Woodland and scrub communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Woodland and scrub communities]] (25 communities, prefixed with the letter "W" &amp;mdash; 19 classed as woodland, four as scrub and two as 'underscrub')
* [[Mires in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Mires]] (38 communities, prefixed "M")
* [[Heaths in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Heaths]] (22 communities, prefixed "H")
* [[Mesotrophic grasslands in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Mesotrophic grasslands]] (13 communities, prefixed "MG")
* [[Calcicolous grasslands in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Calcicolous grasslands]] (14 communities, prefixed "CG")
* [[Calcifugous grasslands and montane communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Calcifugous grasslands and montane communities]] (21 communities, prefixed "U")
* [[Aquatic communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Aquatic communities]] (24 communities, prefixed "A")
* [[Swamps and tall-herb fens in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Swamps and tall-herb fens]] (28 communities, prefixed "S")
* [[Salt-marsh communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Salt-marsh communities]] (28 communities, prefixed "SM")
* [[Shingle, strandline and sand-dune communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Shingle, strandline and sand-dune communities]] (19 communities, prefixed "SD" &amp;mdash; one shingle, two strandline and 16 sand-dune communities)
* [[Maritime cliff communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Maritime cliff communities]] (12 communities, prefixed "MC")
* [[Vegetation of open habitats in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Vegetation of open habitats]] (42 communities, prefixed "OV")

A full list of these communities, grouped into the above categories, can be found at [[List of plant communities in the British National Vegetation Classification]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2503">{{For|the similarly named inequality in [[probability theory]]|Chebyshev's inequality}}

In [[mathematics]], '''Chebyshev's sum inequality''', named after [[Pafnuty Chebyshev]], states that if

:&lt;math&gt;a_1 \geq a_2 \geq \cdots \geq a_n&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;b_1 \geq b_2 \geq \cdots \geq b_n,&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;{1\over n} \sum_{k=1}^n a_k \cdot b_k \geq \left({1\over n}\sum_{k=1}^n a_k\right)\left({1\over n}\sum_{k=1}^n b_k\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, if

:&lt;math&gt;a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \cdots \leq a_n&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;b_1 \geq b_2 \geq \cdots \geq b_n,&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;{1\over n} \sum_{k=1}^n a_kb_k \leq \left({1\over n}\sum_{k=1}^n a_k\right)\left({1\over n}\sum_{k=1}^n b_k\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|mr=0944909|last=Hardy|first=G. H.|last2=Littlewood|first2=J. E.|last3=Pólya|first3=G.|title=Inequalities|series=Cambridge Mathematical Library|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1988|isbn=0-521-35880-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof==
Consider the sum

:&lt;math&gt; S = \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^n (a_j - a_k) (b_j - b_k).&lt;/math&gt;

The two sequences are non-increasing, therefore {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} have the same sign for any {{math|''j'',&amp;nbsp;''k''}}. Hence {{math|''S''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;0}}.

Opening the brackets, we deduce:

:&lt;math&gt; 0 \leq 2 n \sum_{j=1}^n a_j b_j - 2 \sum_{j=1}^n a_j \, \sum_{k=1}^n b_k,&lt;/math&gt;

whence

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n a_j b_j \geq \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n a_j\right) \, \left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n b_k\right).&lt;/math&gt;

An alternative proof is simply obtained with the [[rearrangement inequality]], writing that
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} b_j = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a_i b_j =\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}  a_i b_{i+k~\text{mod}~n} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i b_{i+k~\text{mod}~n}
\leq \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_ib_i = n \sum_i a_ib_i.&lt;/math&gt;

==Continuous version==
There is also a continuous version of Chebyshev's sum inequality:

If ''f'' and ''g'' are real-valued, integrable functions over [0,1], both non-increasing or both non-decreasing, then

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^1 f(x)g(x) \, dx \geq \int_0^1 f(x) \, dx \int_0^1 g(x) \, dx, &lt;/math&gt;

with the inequality reversed if one is non-increasing and the other is non-decreasing.

'''Comparatio''' in [[Classical rhetoric]] is strategy that uses ''comparison'' to persuade people. Comparatio relies upon people's [[knowledge]] or [[belief]]s about a phenomenon, and then discursively "links" that phenomenon to a different phenomenon about which the speaker/writer wishes to make a claim.

For example, if someone wanted to persuade an audience of the merit of putting in a new freeway system, they could use comparatio as a rhetorical strategy. They might compare the new freeway system to a "river of life flowing through our community" or they could call it a "path to commercial vibrance."

Comparisons can also be made to phenomena about which an audience could be expected to have negative feelings. For example, if you were opposed to the new freeway because of the environmental damage it would do to waterfowl nesting areas, you might compare the new freeway to "a corridor of death for our bird species."

The rhetorical success of comparatio hinges upon comparing your claim to a phenomenon that is:
*familiar to the audience
*likely to evoke emotional feelings
*adequately similar to your claim to seem logical.

It would not, for example, work well to call the freeway a "ham sandwich lodged in the throat of the community." The freeway seems more logically related to the throat (a passageway or throughway) than an obstacle in that passageway.

People who experience compassion fatigue can exhibit several symptoms including [[hopelessness]], a decrease in experiences of pleasure, constant stress and anxiety, sleeplessness or nightmares, and a pervasive negative [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. This can have detrimental effects on individuals, both professionally and personally, including a decrease in productivity, the inability to focus, and the development of new feelings of incompetency and self-doubt.&lt;ref name="a1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transitionsandyou.com/Compassion_Fatigue.pdf |title=Compassion Fatigue - Because You Care |accessdate=February 2007 |work=St. Petersburg Bar Association Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120225541/http://www.transitionsandyou.com/Compassion_Fatigue.pdf |archivedate=November 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalism analysts argue that news media have caused widespread compassion fatigue in society by saturating newspapers and news shows with decontextualized images and stories of tragedy and suffering. This has caused the public to become desensitized or resistant to helping people who are suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartcenter.org/training/selfstudy/3_photojournalism/04.php| title=Traumatic Stress &amp; The News Audience| accessdate=June 2008 | publisher=[[Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Compassion fatigue has been studied by the field of traumatology, where it has been called the "cost of caring" for people facing emotional pain. 
 
Compassion fatigue has also been called secondary victimization,&lt;ref&gt;Figley, C. (1982). Traumatization and comfort: Close relationships may be hazardous to your health. Keynote presentation at the Conference, Families and close relationships: Individuals in social interaction, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas, February.&lt;/ref&gt; secondary traumatic stress,&lt;ref&gt;Figley, C. R. (1983). Catastrophes: A overview of family reactions. In C. R. Figley and H. I. McCubbin (Eds.), Stress and the Family: Volume II: Coping with Catastrophe. New York: Brunner/Mazel, 3-20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[vicarious traumatization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lisa McCann|first=I.|last2=Pearlman|first2=Laurie Anne|date=1990-01-01|title=Vicarious traumatization: A framework for understanding the psychological effects of working with victims|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jts.2490030110/abstract|journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=131–149|doi=10.1002/jts.2490030110|issn=1573-6598}}&lt;/ref&gt; and secondary survivor.&lt;ref&gt;Remer, R., &amp; Elliott, J. E. (1988). Characteristics of secondary victims of sexual assault. International Journal of Family Psychiatry, 9(4), 373-387.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other related conditions are rape-related family crisis&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, C. A. (1989). Rape and the family. ''Treating stress in families'', 257-289.&lt;/ref&gt; and "proximity" effects on female partners of war veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verbosky|first=S. J.|last2=Ryan|first2=D. A.|date=1988|title=Female partners of Vietnam veterans: stress by proximity|journal=Issues in Mental Health Nursing|volume=9|issue=1|pages=95–104|issn=0161-2840|pmid=3356550}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compassion fatigue has been called a form of [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]] in some literature. However, unlike compassion fatigue, “burnout” is related to chronic tedium in careers and the workplace, rather than exposure to specific kinds of client problems such as trauma.&lt;ref name="a2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beck | first1 = C | year = 2011 | title = Secondary Traumatic Stress in Nurses: A Systematic Review | url = | journal = Archives of Psychiatric Nursing | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 1–10 | doi = 10.1016/j.apnu.2010.05.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; fMRI-rt research suggests the idea of compassion without engaging in real-life trauma is not exhausting itself. According to these, when [[empathy]] was analyzed with compassion through [[neuroimaging]], empathy showed brain region activations where previously identified to be related to pain whereas compassion showed warped neural activations.&lt;ref name="Altruism: Ricard"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ricard |first=Matthieu|title=Altruism: The Power of Compassion to Change Yourself and the World|chapter=IV|chapter-url=http://info-buddhism.com/Empathy-Compassion-Neuroscience-Ricard-Altruism.html|pages=56–64|year=2015|publisher=Brown and Company|isbn=978-0316208246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matthieuricard.org/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMDYvMDQvMTBfMjNfNDNfNjIxX0tsaW1lY2tpX0xlaWJlcmdfUmljYXJkX1Npbmdlcl8yMDEzX1NDQU4ucGRmIl1d/Klimecki_Leiberg_Ricard_Singer_2013_SCAN.pdf Differential pattern of functional brain plasticity after compassion and empathy training], Olga M. Klimecki, Susanne Leiberg, Matthieu Ricard, and Tania Singer, Department of Social Neuroscience, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

In academic literature, the more technical term ''secondary traumatic stress disorder'' may be used. The term "compassion fatigue" is considered somewhat [[euphemism|euphemistic]]. Compassion fatigue also carries sociological connotations, especially when used to analyse the behavior of mass donations in response to the media response to disasters. One measure of compassion fatigue is in the ProQOL, or Professional Quality of Life Scale. Another is the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale.

==Risk factors==

Several personal attributes place a person at risk for developing compassion fatigue.  Persons who are overly conscientious, perfectionists,&lt;ref&gt;D’Souza, Egan, &amp; Rees, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and self-giving are more likely to suffer from secondary traumatic stress.  Those who have low levels of social support or high levels of stress in personal life are also more likely to develop STS.  In addition, previous histories of trauma that led to negative [[coping skills]], such as bottling up or avoiding emotions, having small support systems, increase the risk for developing STS.&lt;ref name="a3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meadors | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2008 | title = Compassion Fatigue and Secondary Traumatization: Provider Self Care on the Intensive Care Units for Children | url = | journal = Journal of Pediatric Health | volume = 22 | issue = 1| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many organizational attributes in the fields where STS is most common, such as the healthcare field, contribute to compassion fatigue among the workers.  For example, a “culture of silence” where stressful events such as deaths in an intensive-care unit are not discussed after the event is linked to compassion fatigue. Lack of awareness of symptoms and poor training in the risks associated with high-stress jobs can also contribute to high rates of STS.&lt;ref name="a3" /&gt;

==In healthcare professionals==

Between 16% and 85% of [[Health care provider|health care workers]] in various fields develop compassion fatigue.  In one study, approximately 85% of emergency room nurses met the criteria for compassion fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hooper | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2010 | title = Compassion Satisfaction, Burnout, and Compassion Fatigue Among Emergency Nurses Compared With Nurses in Other Selected Inpatient Specialties | url = | journal = Journal of Emergency Nursing | volume = 36 | issue = 5| pages = 420–427 | doi = 10.1016/j.jen.2009.11.027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In another study, more than 25% of ambulance paramedics were identified as having severe ranges of post-traumatic symptoms.&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;  In addition, 34% of hospice nurses in another study met the criteria for secondary traumatic stress/compassion fatigue.&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;

Healthcare professionals experiencing compassion fatigue may find it difficult to continue doing their jobs. They can be exposed to trauma while trying to deal with compassion fatigue, potentially pushing them out of their career field. If they decide to stay, it can negatively affect the therapeutic relationship they have with patients because it depends on forming an empathetic, trusting relationship that could be difficult to make in the midst of compassion fatigue. Because of this, healthcare institutions are placing increased importance on supporting their employees emotional needs so they can better care for patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sorenson|first=Claire|last2=Bolick|first2=Beth|last3=Wright|first3=Karen|last4=Hamilton|first4=Rebekah|title=An Evolutionary Concept Analysis of Compassion Fatigue|journal=Journal of Nursing Scholarship|language=en|volume=49|issue=5|pages=557–563|doi=10.1111/jnu.12312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caregiver]]s for dependent people can also experience compassion fatigue; this can become a cause of abusive behavior in caring professions. It results from the taxing nature of showing compassion for someone whose [[suffering]] is continuous and unresolvable.  One may still care for the person as required by policy, however, the natural human desire to help them is significantly diminished. This phenomenon also occurs for professionals involved with long-term [[health care]]. It can also occur for loved ones who have [[Institution#Institutionalisation|institutionalized]] family members. These people may develop symptoms of [[clinical depression|depression]], [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], and [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]. Those who are [[primary care]] providers for patients with [[terminal illness]]es are at a higher risk of developing these symptoms. In the medical profession, this is often described as "[[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]]": the more specific terms secondary traumatic stress and [[Vicarious traumatization|vicarious trauma]] are also used.  Some professionals may be predisposed to compassion fatigue due to personal trauma.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Mental health professionals are another group that often suffer from compassion fatigue, particularly when they treat those who have suffered extensive trauma.  A study on mental health professionals that were providing clinical services to Katrina victims found that rates of negative psychological symptoms increased in the group.  Of those interviewed, 72% reported experiencing anxiety, 62% experienced increased suspiciousness about the world around them, and 42% reported feeling increasingly vulnerable after treating the Katrina victims.&lt;ref&gt;Culver, L., McKinney, B., Paradise, L. (2011). Mental Health Professionals' Experiences of Vicarious Traumatization in Post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans, 16(1), 33-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compassion fatigue, or vicarious trauma, refers to the secondary exposure to trauma seen in fields where workers are directly in contact with the sufferer(s). Symptoms manifest as visualizing the event, insomnia, fear, and avoiding anything that can remind someone of what happened. Those caring for people who have experienced trauma can experience a change in how they view the world; they see it more negatively. It can negatively affect the worker's sense of self, of safety, and of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Hook | first1 = M. P. | last2 = Rothenberg | first2 = M. | year = 2009 | title = Quality of life and compassion satisfaction/fatigue and burnout in child welfare workers: A study of the child welfare workers in community based care organizations in Central Florida | url = http://0-search.ebscohost.com.cals.evergreen.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=sih&amp;AN=36917554&amp;site=ehost-live | journal = Social Work &amp; Christianity | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 36–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with a better ability to empathize and be compassionate are at a higher risk of developing compassion fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;Figley, C. R. (1995). Compassion fatigue as secondary stress disorder: An overview. Compassion fatigue: coping with secondary traumatic stress disorder in those who treat the traumatized (1-20). New York: Brunner/Mazel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who experience compassion fatigue, or STS, can begin to exhibit patterns where they feel disengaged, inadequate, overwhelmed, parental, undervalued, over-involved, sexualized, or positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Betan|first=Ephi|last2=Heim|first2=Amy Kegley|last3=Zittel Conklin|first3=Carolyn|last4=Westen|first4=Drew|date=2005-05-01|title=Countertransference Phenomena and Personality Pathology in Clinical Practice: An Empirical Investigation|url=https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.162.5.890|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=162|issue=5|pages=890–898|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.5.890|issn=0002-953X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another name and concept directly tied to compassion fatigue is moral injury. Moral injury in the context of healthcare was directly named in the ''Stat News'' article by Drs. Wendy Dean and Simon Talbot, entitled "Physicians aren’t ‘burning out.’ They’re suffering from moral injury."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.statnews.com/2018/07/26/physicians-not-burning-out-they-are-suffering-moral-injury/|title=Physicians aren't 'burning out.' They're suffering from moral injury - STAT|date=2018-07-26|work=STAT|access-date=2018-09-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article and concept goes on to explain that physicians (in the United States) are caught in double and triple and quadruple binds between their obligations of electronic health records, their own student loans, the requirements for patient load through the hospital and number of procedures performed – all while working towards the goal of trying to provide the best care and healing to patients possible. However, the systemic issues facing physicians often cause deep distress because the patients are suffering, despite a physician's best efforts. This concept of Moral Injury in healthcare&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moralinjury.healthcare/|title=Moral Injury of Healthcare|last=Talbot, Dean|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the expansion of the discussion around compassion fatigue and 'burnout.'

== In lawyers ==

Recent research shows that a growing number of attorneys who work with victims of trauma are exhibiting a high rate of compassion fatigue symptoms. In fact, lawyers are four times more likely to suffer from depression than the general public. They also have a higher rate of [[suicide]] and [[substance abuse]]. Most attorneys, when asked, stated that their formal education lacked adequate training in dealing with trauma. Besides working directly with trauma victims, one of the main reasons attorneys can develop compassion fatigue is because of the demanding case loads, and long hours that are typical to this profession.&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;

==Prevention==
There is an effort to prepare those in the healthcare professions to combat compassion fatigue through resiliency training. Teaching workers how to relax in stressful situations, be intentional in their duties and work with integrity, find people and resources who are supportive and understand the risks of compassion fatigue, and focus on self-care are all components of this training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potter|first=Patricia|last2=Pion|first2=Sarah|last3=Gentry|first3=J. Eric|title=Compassion Fatigue Resiliency Training: The Experience of Facilitators|journal=The Journal of Continuing Education in Nursing|language=en|volume=46|issue=2|pages=83–88|doi=10.3928/00220124-20151217-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal self-care===
[[Stress reduction]] and anxiety management practices have been shown to be effective in preventing and treating STS.  Taking a break from work, participating in breathing exercises, exercising, and other recreational activities all help reduce the stress associated with STS. Conceptualizing one's own ability with self-integration from a theoretical and practice perspective helps to combat criticized or devalued phase of STS.  In addition, establishing clear [[professional boundaries]] and accepting the fact that successful outcomes are not always achievable can limit the effects of STS.&lt;ref name="a4"&gt;Huggard, P. (2003). Secondary Traumatic Stress: Doctors at risk. New Ethicals Journal. http://home.cogeco.ca/~cmc/Huggard_NewEthJ_2003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social self-care===
[[Social support]] and emotional support can help practitioners maintain a balance in their worldview.&lt;ref name="pat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/health-care/for-better/articles/2017-02-27/politically-active-4-tips-for-incorporating-self-care |title=Politically Active? 4 Tips for Incorporating Self-Care, US News |date=27 February 2017 |work=US News |accessdate=5 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maintaining a diverse network of social support, from colleagues to pets, promotes a positive psychological state and can protect against STS.&lt;ref name="a4" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4490">[[Image:Cone.svg|right|thumb|250px|Cone of a circle. The original space is in blue, and the collapsed end point is in green.]]
In [[topology]], especially [[algebraic topology]], the '''cone''' ''CX'' '''of a [[topological space]]''' ''X'' is the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]]:

:&lt;math&gt;CX = (X \times I)/(X \times \{0\})&lt;/math&gt;

of the [[product topology|product]] of ''X'' with the [[unit interval]] ''I'' = [0, 1]. 
Intuitively, this construction makes ''X'' into a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] and collapses one end of the cylinder to a [[point (topology)|point]].

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Compact space|compact]] subspace of [[Euclidean space]], the cone on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is [[homeomorphic]] to the [[union (set theory)|union]] of segments from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to any fixed point &lt;math&gt; v \not\in X &lt;/math&gt; such that these segments intersect only by &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; itself. That is, the topological cone agrees with the geometric cone for compact spaces when the latter is defined. However, the topological cone construction is more general.

==Examples==
Here we often use geometric cone (defined in the introduction) instead of the topological one. The considered spaces are compact, so we get the same result up to homeomorphism.

* The cone over a point ''p'' of the real line is the interval {''p''} x [0,1].
* The cone over two points {0,1} is a "V" shape with endpoints at {0} and {1}.
* The cone over a closed interval ''I'' of the real line is a filled-in [[triangle]] (with one of the edges being ''I''), otherwise known as a 2-simplex (see the final example). 
* The cone over a [[polygon]] ''P'' is a pyramid with base ''P''.
* The cone over a [[disk (mathematics)|disk]] is the solid [[cone (geometry)|cone]] of classical geometry (hence the concept's name).
* The cone over a [[circle]] given by
::&lt;math&gt;\{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb R^3 \mid x^2 + y^2 = 1 \mbox{ and } z=0\}&lt;/math&gt;
is the curved surface of the solid cone:
::&lt;math&gt;\{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb R^3 \mid x^2 + y^2 = (z-1)^2 \mbox{ and } 0\leq z\leq 1\}.&lt;/math&gt;
:This in turn is homeomorphic to the closed [[disc (mathematics)|disc]].
* In general, the cone over an [[n-sphere]] is homeomorphic to the closed (''n''+1)-[[ball (mathematics)|ball]].
* The cone over an ''n''-[[simplex]] is an (''n''+1)-simplex.

==Properties==

All cones are [[path-connected space|path-connected]] since every point can be connected to the vertex point. Furthermore, every cone is [[contractible]] to the vertex point by the [[homotopy]]

:''h''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''s'') = (''x'', (1&amp;minus;''t'')''s'').

The cone is used in algebraic topology precisely because it embeds a space as a [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of a contractible space.

When ''X'' is [[compact space|compact]] and [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] (essentially, when ''X'' can be embedded in Euclidean space), then the cone ''CX'' can be visualized as the collection of lines joining every point of ''X'' to a single point. However, this picture fails when ''X'' is not compact or not Hausdorff, as generally the [[quotient topology]] on ''CX'' will be [[finer topology|finer]] than the set of lines joining ''X'' to a point.

== Cone functor ==
The map &lt;math&gt;X\mapsto CX&lt;/math&gt; induces a [[functor]] &lt;math&gt;C:\mathbf{Top}\to\mathbf {Top}&lt;/math&gt; on the [[category of topological spaces]] '''Top'''. If &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;is a continuous map, then &lt;math&gt;Cf : CX \to CY&lt;/math&gt;is defined by &lt;math&gt;(Cf)([x,t])=[f(x),t]&lt;/math&gt;, where square brackets denote equivalence classes.

==Reduced cone==
If &lt;math&gt;(X,x_0)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[pointed space]], there is a related construction, the '''reduced cone''', given by 
:&lt;math&gt;(X\times [0,1]) / (X\times \left\{0\right\}
\cup\left\{x_0\right\}\times [0,1])&lt;/math&gt;

where we take the basepoint of the reduced cone to be the equivalence class of  &lt;math&gt;(x_0,0)&lt;/math&gt;. With this definition, the natural inclusion  &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto (x,1)&lt;/math&gt; becomes a based map.  This construction also gives a functor, from the category of pointed spaces to itself.

A '''consumption map''' or '''efficiency map'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QAGHZPVnnSAC&amp;pg=PA540 Dieter Lohse und Werner Schnabel: ''Grundlagen der Straßenverkehrstechnik und der Verkehrsplanung: Band 1'', Beuth Verlag, 2011, ISBN 9783410172710.]&lt;/ref&gt; shows the [[Brake specific fuel consumption|brake-specific fuel consumption]] in g per kWh over [[mean effective pressure]] per [[rotational speed]] of an [[internal combustion engine]].

The x-axis shows the [[rotational speed]] range. The y-axis represents the load on the engine. The [[contour line]]s show the specific fuel consumption, indicating the areas of the speed/load regime where the engine is more or less efficient.

The map contains each possible condition, combining rotational speed and [[mean effective pressure]]. It shows the result of specific fuel consumption. A typical rotation power output '''P''' (linear to &lt;math&gt;p_{e} \cdot \omega&lt;/math&gt; ) is reached on several locations on the map but differing in the amount of fuel consumption. [[Automatic transmission]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, are designed to keep the engine at the speed with the lowest possible fuel consumption, given the power demand.

The map also shows the efficiency of the engine. Depending on the fuel type, [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[gasoline]] engines reach up to 210&amp;nbsp;g/kWh and about 40% efficiency. Using [[natural gas]] this efficiency is reached at 200&amp;nbsp;g/kWh.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Golloch, ''Downsizing bei Dieselmotoren'', Abschnitt ''2.1.3 Verbrennung'', 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Culture''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʌ|l|tʃ|ər}}) is the [[social behavior]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[Society|societies]]. Culture is considered a central concept in [[anthropology]], encompassing the range of phenomena that are transmitted through social [[learning]] in human [[society|societies]]. [[Cultural universals]] are found in all human societies; these include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[Tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers the physical expressions of culture, such as technology, architecture and art, whereas the immaterial aspects of culture such as principles of [[social organization]] (including practices of [[political organization]] and social [[institutions]]), [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]] (both [[writing|written]] and [[oral literature|oral]]), and [[science]] comprise the [[intangible cultural heritage]] of a society.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber and 2010 53"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995|title=Sociology|last=Macionis|first=John J|last2=Gerber|first2=Linda Marie|date=2011|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|oclc=652430995|isbn=978-0137001613|location=Toronto|language=English|page=53|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995|archive-date=August 18, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[humanities]], one sense of culture as an attribute of the individual has been the degree to which they have cultivated a particular level of sophistication in [[the arts]], sciences, [[education]], or manners. The level of cultural sophistication has also sometimes been seen to distinguish [[civilization]]s from less complex societies. Such hierarchical perspectives on culture are also found in [[Social class|class-based]] distinctions between a [[high culture]] of the social [[elite]] and a [[low culture]], [[popular culture]], or [[folk culture]] of the lower classes, distinguished by the stratified access to [[cultural capital]]. In common parlance, culture is often used to refer specifically to the symbolic markers used by [[ethnicity|ethnic groups]] to distinguish themselves visibly from each other such as [[body modification]], [[clothing]] or [[jewelry]]. [[Media culture|Mass culture]] refers to the [[Mass production|mass-produced]] and [[mass media]]ted forms of [[consumer culture]] that emerged in the 20th century. Some schools of philosophy, such as [[Marxism]] and [[critical theory]], have argued that culture is often used politically as a tool of the elites to manipulate the lower classes and create a [[false consciousness]], and such perspectives are common in the discipline of [[cultural studies]]. In the wider [[social sciences]], the theoretical perspective of [[cultural materialism (cultural studies)|cultural materialism]] holds that human symbolic culture arises from the material conditions of human life, as humans create the conditions for physical survival, and that the basis of culture is found in [[human evolution|evolved biological]] dispositions.

When used as a [[count noun]], a "culture" is the set of customs, [[tradition]]s, and values of a society or community, such as an ethnic group or nation. Culture is the set of knowledge acquired over time. In this sense, [[multiculturalism]] values the peaceful coexistence and mutual respect between different cultures inhabiting the same planet. Sometimes "culture" is also used to describe specific practices within a subgroup of a society, a [[subculture]] (e.g. "[[bro culture]]"), or a [[counterculture]]. Within [[cultural anthropology]], the ideology and analytical stance of [[cultural relativism]] holds that cultures cannot easily be objectively ranked or evaluated because any evaluation is necessarily situated within the value system of a given culture.

== Etymology ==
The modern term "culture" is based on a term used by the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] orator [[Cicero]] in his ''[[Tusculanae Disputationes]]'', where he wrote of a cultivation of the soul or ''"cultura animi,"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ZcOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA273|title=Tusculanes|last=Cicéron|first=Marcus Tullius Cicero|last2=Bouhier|first2=Jean|date=1812|publisher=J. Gaude|location=Nismes|oclc=457735057|page=273|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; using an [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[metaphor]] for the development of a philosophical soul, understood [[teleology|teleologically]] as the highest possible ideal for human development. [[Samuel Pufendorf]] took over this metaphor in a modern context, meaning something similar, but no longer assuming that philosophy was man's natural perfection. His use, and that of many writers after him, "''refers to all the ways in which human beings overcome their original [[Barbarian|barbarism]], and through artifice, become fully human."''&lt;ref name=velkley&gt;{{Cite book|title=Being after Rousseau: philosophy and culture in question|last=Velkley|first=Richard L|date=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|oclc=47930775|isbn=978-0226852560|chapter=The Tension in the Beautiful: On Culture and Civilization in Rousseau and German Philosophy|pages=11–30|location=Chicago|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, philosopher [[Edward S. Casey]] wrote, "The very word ''culture'' meant 'place tilled' in Middle English, and the same word goes back to Latin ''colere'', 'to inhabit, care for, till, worship' and ''cultus'', 'A cult, especially a religious one.' To be cultural, to have a culture, is to inhabit a place sufficiently intensive to cultivate it—to be responsible for it, to respond to it, to attend to it caringly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sorrells|first1=Kathryn|title=Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice|date=2015|publisher=Sage|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1412927444}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;!-- Ref provided is based purely on ASIN from earlier, incomplete, citation. NEEDS Verification --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture described by [[Richard Velkley]]:&lt;ref name=velkley/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;... originally meant the cultivation of the soul or mind, acquires most of its later modern meaning in the writings of the 18th-century German thinkers, who were on various levels developing [[Rousseau]]'s criticism of "[[modernity|modern]] [[liberalism]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]". Thus a contrast between "culture" and "[[civilization]]" is usually implied in these authors, even when not expressed as such.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the words of anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.B. Tylor]], it is "that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."{{sfn|Tylor|1974|loc=1}} Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, "Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/9294719|title=Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability|last=James|first=Paul|last2=Magee|first2=Liam|last3=Scerri|first3=Andy|last4=Steger|first4=Manfred|date=2015|isbn=978-1138025721|oclc=942553107|page=53|publisher=Routledge|location=London|language=en|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626015736/http://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_|archive-date=June 26, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary|Cambridge English Dictionary]]'' states that culture is "the way of life, especially the general customs and beliefs, of a particular group of people at a particular time."&lt;ref name="dict_cult"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/culture|title=Meaning of "culture"|work=Cambridge English Dictionary|language=en|access-date=July 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815114957/http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/culture|archive-date=August 15, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terror management theory]] posits that culture is a series of activities and worldviews that provide humans with the basis for perceiving themselves as "person[s] of worth within the world of meaning"—raising themselves above the merely physical aspects of existence, in order to deny the animal insignificance and death that ''Homo sapiens'' became aware of when they acquired a larger brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0065260115000052|title=Thirty Years of Terror Management Theory|volume=52|last=Pyszczynski|first=Tom|last2=Solomon|first2=Sheldon|last3=Greenberg|first3=Jeff|pages=1–70|language=en|doi=10.1016/bs.aesp.2015.03.001|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915131346/http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0065260115000052|archive-date=September 15, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all|series=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|year=2015|isbn=978-0128022474}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g_9dAgAAQBAJ|title=Handbook of Experimental Existential Psychology|last=Greenberg|first=Jeff|last2=Koole|first2=Sander L.|last3=Pyszczynski|first3=Tom|year=2013|publisher=Guilford Publications|isbn=978-1462514793|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is used in a general sense as the evolved ability to categorize and represent experiences with [[symbol]]s and to act imaginatively and creatively. This ability arose with the evolution of [[behavioral modernity]] in humans around 50,000 years ago, and is often thought to be unique to humans, although some other species have demonstrated similar, though much less complex, abilities for social learning. It is also used to denote the complex networks of practices and accumulated knowledge and ideas that is transmitted through social [[interaction]] and exist in specific human groups, or cultures, using the plural form.

==Change==

It has been estimated from archaeological data that the human capacity for cumulative culture emerged somewhere between 500,000–170,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lind|first=J.|last2=Lindenfors|first2=P.|last3=Ghirlanda|first3=S.|last4=Lidén|first4=K.|last5=Enquist|first5=M.|date=2013-05-07|title=Dating human cultural capacity using phylogenetic principles|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep01785|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=3|issue=1|page=1785|doi=10.1038/srep01785|issn=2045-2322|pmc=3646280|pmid=23648831|access-date=May 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002081545/http://www.nature.com/articles/srep01785|archive-date=October 2, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raimon Panikkar]] identified 29 ways in which [[cultural change]] can be brought about, including growth, development, evolution, [[Involution (esoterism)|involution]], renovation, [[reconception]], reform, innovation, [[revivalism]], revolution, [[mutation]], progress, [[diffusion]], osmosis, borrowing, [[eclecticism]], [[syncretism]], modernization, [[indigenization]], and transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religious Pluralism: An Indian Christian Perspective|last=Panikkar|first=Raimon|editor-last=Pathil|editor-first=Kuncheria|date=1991|publisher=[[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge|ISPCK]]|isbn=978-8172140052|oclc=25410539|pages=252–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, modernization could be viewed as adoption of Enlightenment era beliefs and practices, such as science, rationalism, industry, commerce, democracy, and the notion of progress. [[Rein Raud]], building on the work of [[Umberto Eco]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Jeffrey C.

[[Cultural invention]] has come to mean any innovation that is new and found to be useful to a group of people and expressed in their behavior but which does not exist as a physical object. Humanity is in a global "accelerating culture change period," driven by the expansion of international commerce, the mass media, and above all, the [[World population|human population]] explosion, among other factors. [[Culture change|Culture repositioning]] means the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chigbu|first=Uchendu Eugene|date=2015-07-03|title=Repositioning culture for development: women and development in a Nigerian rural community|journal=Community, Work &amp; Family|volume=18|issue=3|pages=334–50|doi=10.1080/13668803.2014.981506|issn=1366-8803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultures are internally affected by both forces encouraging change and forces resisting change. These forces are related to both [[social structure]]s and natural events, and are involved in the perpetuation of cultural ideas and practices within current structures, which themselves are subject to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/change/change_2.htm|title=Culture Change: Processes of Change|last=O'Neil|first=Dennis|date=2006|website=Culture Change|publisher=Palomar College|access-date=October 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027181934/http://anthro.palomar.edu/change/change_2.htm|archive-date=October 27, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[structuration]].)

Social conflict and the development of technologies can produce changes within a society by altering social dynamics and promoting new [[schema (psychology)|cultural models]], and spurring or enabling [[generative actor|generative action]]. These social shifts may accompany [[ideology|ideological]] shifts and other types of cultural change. For example, the U.S. [[feminist movement]] involved new practices that produced a shift in gender relations, altering both gender and economic structures. Environmental conditions may also enter as factors. For example, after tropical forests returned at the end of the last [[ice age]], plants suitable for domestication were available, leading to the invention of [[agriculture]], which in turn brought about many cultural innovations and shifts in social dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pringle|first=Heather|date=November 20, 1998|title=The Slow Birth of Agriculture|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/282/5393/1446|journal=Science|language=en|volume=282|issue=5393|page=1446|doi=10.1126/science.282.5393.1446|issn=0036-8075|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807163436/http://science.sciencemag.org/content/282/5393/1446|archive-date=August 7, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies, which may also produce—or inhibit—social shifts and changes in cultural practices. War or competition over resources may impact technological development or social dynamics. Additionally, cultural ideas may transfer from one society to another, through diffusion or acculturation. In [[diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion]], the form of something (though not necessarily its meaning) moves from one culture to another. For example, [[hamburger]]s, fast food in the United States, seemed exotic when introduced into China.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} "Stimulus diffusion" (the sharing of ideas) refers to an element of one culture leading to an invention or propagation in another. "Direct borrowing," on the other hand, tends to refer to technological or tangible diffusion from one culture to another. [[Diffusion of innovations]] theory presents a research-based model of why and when individuals and cultures adopt new ideas, practices, and products.

[[Acculturation]] has different meanings, but in this context it refers to replacement of the traits of one culture with those of another, such as what happened to certain [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes and to many indigenous peoples across the globe during the process of [[colonization]]. Related processes on an individual level include [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] (adoption of a different culture by an individual) and [[transculturation]]. The transnational flow of culture has played a major role in merging different culture and sharing thoughts, ideas, and beliefs.

==Early modern discourses==

===German Romanticism===
[[File:Johann gottfried herder.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johann Herder]] called attention to national cultures.]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) formulated an individualist definition of "enlightenment" similar to the concept of ''[[bildung]]'': "Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1784. "Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?" (German: "Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufklärung?") ''Berlinische Monatsschrift'', December (Berlin Monthly)&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that this immaturity comes not from a lack of understanding, but from a lack of courage to think independently. Against this intellectual cowardice, Kant urged: ''Sapere aude'', "Dare to be wise!" In reaction to Kant, German scholars such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744–1803) argued that human creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms, is as important as human rationality. Moreover, Herder proposed a collective form of ''bildung'': "For Herder, Bildung was the totality of experiences that provide a coherent identity, and sense of common destiny, to a people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/SAAP/USC/pbt1.html|title=The German Bildung Tradition|last=Eldridge|first=Michael|publisher=[[UNC Charlotte]]|access-date=2017-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123162257/http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/SAAP/USC/pbt1.html|archive-date=January 23, 2009|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adolf Bastian.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Adolf Bastian]] developed a universal model of culture.]]
In 1795, the Prussian linguist and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] (1767–1835) called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant's and Herder's interests. During the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]], scholars in [[Germany]], especially those concerned with [[nationalism|nationalist]] movements—such as the nationalist struggle to create a "Germany" out of diverse principalities, and the nationalist struggles by ethnic minorities against the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]—developed a more inclusive notion of culture as "[[world view|worldview]]" (''Weltanschauung'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Humboldt, Worldview, and Language|last=Underhill|first=James W.|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Edinburgh|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this school of thought, each ethnic group has a distinct worldview that is incommensurable with the worldviews of other groups. Although more inclusive than earlier views, this approach to culture still allowed for distinctions between "civilized" and "primitive" or "tribal" cultures.

In 1860, [[Adolf Bastian]] (1826–1905) argued for "the psychic unity of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adolf Bastian and the psychic unity of mankind|last=Köpping|first=Klaus-Peter|date=2005|publisher=Lit Verlag|isbn=978-3825839895|oclc=977343058}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that a scientific comparison of all human societies would reveal that distinct worldviews consisted of the same basic elements. According to Bastian, all human societies share a set of "elementary ideas" (''Elementargedanken''); different cultures, or different "folk ideas" (''Völkergedanken''), are local modifications of the elementary ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://todayinsci.com/B/Bastian_Adolf/BastianAdolf.htm|title=Biography of Adolf Bastian, ethnologist|last=Ellis|first=Ian|website=Today in Science History|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806215336/https://todayinsci.com/B/Bastian_Adolf/BastianAdolf.htm|archive-date=August 6, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture.

===English Romanticism===
[[File:Matthew Arnold - Project Gutenberg eText 16745.jpg|thumb|left|upright|British poet and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] viewed "culture" as the cultivation of the humanist ideal.]]

In the 19th century, [[Humanism|humanists]] such as [[English people|English]] poet and essayist [[Matthew Arnold]] (1822–1888) used the word "culture" to refer to an ideal of individual human refinement, of "the best that has been thought and said in the world."&lt;ref name=anarchy&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/nonfiction_u/arnoldm_ca/ca_all.html|title=Culture and Anarchy|last=Arnold|first=Matthew|date=1869|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106012655/http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/nonfiction_u/arnoldm_ca/ca_all.html|archive-date=January 6, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of culture is also comparable to the [[German people|German]] concept of ''bildung'': "...culture being a pursuit of our total [[perfection]] by means of getting to know, on all the matters which most concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world."&lt;ref name=anarchy /&gt;

In practice, ''culture'' referred to an [[elite]] ideal and was associated with such activities as [[art]], [[European classical music|classical music]], and [[haute cuisine]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1983), p. 90. Cited in {{Cite book|title=Understanding popular music|last=Roy|first=Shuker|date=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415107235|oclc=245910934|page=5}} argues that contemporary definitions of culture fall into three possibilities or mixture of the following three:
* "a general process of intellectual, spiritual, and aesthetic development"
* "a particular way of life, whether of a people, period, or a group"
* "the works and practices of intellectual and especially artistic activity".&lt;/ref&gt; As these forms were associated with urban life, "culture" was identified with "civilization" (from lat. ''civitas'', city). Another facet of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement was an interest in [[folklore]], which led to identifying a "culture" among non-elites. This distinction is often characterized as that between [[high culture]], namely that of the [[Ruling class|ruling]] [[social group]], and [[low culture]]. In other words, the idea of "culture" that developed in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries reflected inequalities within European societies.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 1981, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|upright|British anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Edward Tylor]] was one of the first English-speaking scholars to use the term culture in an inclusive and universal sense.]]

Matthew Arnold contrasted "culture" with [[anarchy]]; other Europeans, following [[philosophy|philosophers]] [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], contrasted "culture" with "the state of nature." According to Hobbes and Rousseau, the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] who were being conquered by Europeans from the 16th centuries on were living in a state of nature{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}; this opposition was expressed through the contrast between "civilized" and "uncivilized." According to this way of thinking, one could classify some countries and nations as more civilized than others and some people as more cultured than others. This contrast led to [[Herbert Spencer]]'s theory of [[Social Darwinism]] and [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]'s theory of [[cultural evolution]]. Just as some critics have argued that the distinction between high and low cultures is really an expression of the conflict between European elites and non-elites, other critics have argued that the distinction between civilized and uncivilized people is really an expression of the conflict between European colonial powers and their colonial subjects.

Other 19th-century critics, following Rousseau, have accepted this differentiation between higher and lower culture, but have seen the refinement and [[sophistication]] of high culture as corrupting and unnatural developments that obscure and distort people's essential nature.&lt;!-- i.e. American Transcendentalism?? --&gt; These critics considered [[folk music]] (as produced by "the folk," i.e., rural, illiterate, peasants) to honestly express a natural way of life, while classical music seemed superficial and decadent. Equally, this view often portrayed [[indigenous peoples]] as "[[noble savage]]s" living [[authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]] and unblemished lives, uncomplicated and uncorrupted by the highly stratified [[capitalism|capitalist]] systems of [[Western culture|the West]].

In 1870 the anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Edward Tylor]] (1832–1917) applied these ideas of higher versus lower culture to propose a theory of the [[evolution of religion]]. According to this theory, religion evolves from more polytheistic to more monotheistic forms.&lt;ref&gt;McClenon, pp. 528–29&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, he redefined culture as a diverse set of activities characteristic of all human societies. This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture.

==Sociology==
{{main|Sociology of culture}}
The [[sociology of culture]] concerns culture as manifested in [[society]]. For sociologist [[Georg Simmel]] (1858–1918), culture referred to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/oclc/951272809|title=Georg Simmel on individuality and social forms: selected writings|last=Simmel|first=Georg|editor-last=Levine|editor-first=Donald N|date=1971|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226757766|location=Chicago|page=xix|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912194431/https://www.worldcat.org/title/oclc/951272809|archive-date=September 12, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, culture in the [[sociology|sociological]] field can be defined as the ways of thinking, the ways of acting, and the material objects that together shape a people's way of life. Culture can be any of two types, [[non-material culture]] or [[material culture]].&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber and 2010 53" /&gt; Non-material culture refers to the non-physical ideas that individuals have about their culture, including values, belief systems, rules, norms, morals, language, organizations, and institutions, while material culture is the physical evidence of a culture in the objects and architecture they make or have made. The term tends to be relevant only in archeological and anthropological studies, but it specifically means all material evidence which can be attributed to culture, past or present.

Cultural sociology first emerged in [[Weimar Germany]] (1918–1933), where sociologists such as [[Alfred Weber]] used the term ''Kultursoziologie'' (cultural sociology). Cultural sociology was then "reinvented" in the English-speaking world as a product of the "[[cultural turn]]" of the 1960s, which ushered in [[structuralism (sociology)|structuralist]] and [[postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] approaches to social science. This type of cultural sociology may be loosely regarded as an approach incorporating [[cultural analysis]] and [[critical theory]]. Cultural sociologists tend to reject scientific methods, instead [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutically]] focusing on words, artifacts and symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html|title=A Physicist Experiments with Cultural Studies|last=Sokal|first=Alan D.|date=June 5, 1996|website=Lingua Franca|access-date=October 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326152500/http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html|archive-date=March 26, 2007|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}} Physicist [[Alan Sokal]] published a paper in a journal of cultural sociology stating that gravity was a social construct that should be examined hermeneutically. See [[Sokal affair]] for further details.&lt;/ref&gt; "Culture" has since become an important concept across many branches of sociology, including resolutely scientific fields like [[social stratification]] and [[social network|social network analysis]]. As a result, there has been a recent influx of quantitative sociologists to the field. Thus, there is now a growing group of sociologists of culture who are, confusingly, not cultural sociologists. These scholars reject the abstracted postmodern aspects of cultural sociology, and instead look for a theoretical backing in the more scientific vein of [[social psychology]] and [[cognitive science]]. {{Citation needed|reason=Is any research confirms this claim/trend? Otherwise, can this claim be backed up by any major work about this new vein with many substantive contributors (handbook, encyclopedia, periodic dedicated to this new vein, etc.)? In addition, it would be highly beneficial if anyone knowledgeable about this new vein should write at least an additional (even small) section on the psychological / cognitive perspective on culture.|date=July 2018}}

===Early researchers and development of cultural sociology===
The sociology of culture grew from the intersection between sociology (as shaped by early theorists like [[Karl Marx|Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Karl Marx: His Life and Environment|last=Berlin|first=Isaiah|last2=Ryan|first2=Alan|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195103267|oclc=611127754|location=New York|language=English|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]) with the growing discipline of [[anthropology]], wherein researchers pioneered ethnographic strategies for describing and analyzing a variety of cultures around the world. Part of the legacy of the early development of the field lingers in the methods (much of cultural sociological research is qualitative), in the theories (a variety of critical approaches to sociology are central to current research communities), and in the substantive focus of the field. For instance, relationships between [[popular culture]], political control, and [[social class]] were early and lasting concerns in the field.

==Cultural studies==
In the [[United Kingdom]], sociologists and other scholars influenced by [[Marxism]] such as [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] (1932–2014) and [[Raymond Williams]] (1921–1988) developed [[cultural studies]]. Following nineteenth-century Romantics, they identified "culture" with consumption goods and leisure activities (such as art, music, film, [[food]], sports, and clothing). They saw patterns of consumption and leisure as determined by [[relations of production]], which led them to focus on class relations and the organization of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Raymond|date=1983|title=Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/keywords-a-vocabulary-of-culture-and-society/oclc/906396817|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=87–93, 236–38|language=English|journal=|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912193349/https://www.worldcat.org/title/keywords-a-vocabulary-of-culture-and-society/oclc/906396817|archive-date=September 12, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/ways-of-seeing/oclc/780459348|title=Ways of seeing|last=Berger|first=John|date=1972|publisher=Peter Smithn|isbn=978-0563122449|oclc=780459348|language=English|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912191748/https://www.worldcat.org/title/ways-of-seeing/oclc/780459348|archive-date=September 12, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, cultural studies focuses largely on the study of [[popular culture]]; that is, on the social meanings of mass-produced consumer and leisure goods. [[Richard Hoggart]] coined the term in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]] or CCCS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Studying Culture – Reflections and Assessment: An Interview with Richard Hoggart|journal=Media, Culture, and Society|volume=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since become strongly associated with [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/sep/23/communities.politicsphilosophyandsociety|title=Cultural hallmark|last=Adams|first=Tim|date=September 23, 2007|work=The Guardian|access-date=October 30, 2016|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031030223/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/sep/23/communities.politicsphilosophyandsociety|archive-date=October 31, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; who succeeded Hoggart as Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stuart Hall|last=James|first=Procter|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415262675|oclc=318376213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural studies in this sense, then, can be viewed as a limited concentration scoped on the intricacies of consumerism, which belongs to a wider culture sometimes referred to as "[[Western culture|Western civilization]]" or "[[globalism]]."

From the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall's pioneering work, along with that of his colleagues [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], [[Dick Hebdige]], Tony Jefferson, and [[Angela McRobbie]], created an international intellectual movement. As the field developed, it began to combine [[political economy]], [[communication]], [[sociology]], [[social theory]], [[literary theory]], [[Media influence|media theory]], [[film theory|film/video studies]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[philosophy]], [[museum studies]], and [[art history]] to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of [[ideology]], [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[social class]], and/or [[gender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Cultural Studies|last=Sardar|first=Ziauddin|last2=Van Loon|first2=Borin|last3=Appignanesi|first3=Richard|date=1994|publisher=Totem Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1840465877|oclc=937991291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural studies is concerned with the [[Value (personal and cultural)|meaning]] and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television, or eating out) in a given culture. It also studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television in order to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture, unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends in order to "fit in" certainly qualifies, since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice.

In the context of cultural studies, the idea of a ''text'' includes not only [[written language]], but also [[film]]s, [[photography|photographs]], [[fashion]] or [[hairstyle]]s: the texts of cultural studies comprise all the meaningful artifacts of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Myths of Oz: reading Australian popular culture|last=Fiske|first=John|last2=Turner|first2=Graeme|last3=Hodge|first3=Robert Ian Vere|date=1987|publisher=Allen and Unwin|isbn=978-0043303917|oclc=883364628|location=London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the discipline widens the concept of "culture." "Culture" for a cultural-studies researcher not only includes traditional [[high culture]] (the culture of [[Ruling class|ruling]] [[social group]]s)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://proxy2.hec.ca/login?url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/hecm/Doc?id=10439450|title=The dialogic imagination four essays|last=Bakhtin|first=Mikhail Mikhaĭlovich|last2=Holquist|first2=Michael|date=1981|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|language=English|oclc=872436352|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[popular culture]], but also everyday meanings and practices. The last two, in fact, have become the main focus of cultural studies. A further and recent approach is [[comparative cultural studies]], based on the disciplines of [[comparative literature]] and cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepress.purdue.edu/series/comparative-cultural-studies|title=Comparative Cultural Studies|date=2015|website=Purdue University Press|language=en|access-date=October 30, 2016|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805230001/http://www.thepress.purdue.edu/series/comparative-cultural-studies|archive-date=August 5, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] developed somewhat different versions of cultural studies after the late 1970s. The British version of cultural studies had originated in the 1950s and 1960s, mainly under the influence of Richard Hoggart, [[E.P. Thompson]], and [[Raymond Williams]], and later that of Stuart Hall and others at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the [[University of Birmingham]]. This included overtly political, [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] views, and criticisms of [[popular culture]] as "capitalist" [[mass culture]]; it absorbed some of the ideas of the [[Frankfurt School]] critique of the "[[culture industry]]" (i.e. mass culture). This emerges in the writings of early British cultural-studies scholars and their influences: see the work of (for example) Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, Paul Willis, and [[Paul Gilroy]].

In the United States, Lindlof and Taylor write, "Cultural studies [were] grounded in a pragmatic, liberal-pluralist tradition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Qualitative Communication Research Methods|last=Lindlof|first=Thomas R|last2=Taylor|first2=Bryan C|date=2002|publisher=Sage|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0761924937|oclc=780825710|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American version of cultural studies initially concerned itself more with understanding the subjective and appropriative side of audience reactions to, and uses of, [[mass culture]]; for example, American cultural-studies advocates wrote about the liberatory aspects of [[fandom]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The distinction between American and British strands, however, has faded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Some researchers, especially in early British cultural studies, apply a [[Marxist]] model to the field. This strain of thinking has some influence from the [[Frankfurt School]], but especially from the [[structuralism|structuralist]] Marxism of [[Louis Althusser]] and others. The main focus of an orthodox Marxist approach concentrates on the ''production'' of [[Value (personal and cultural)|meaning]]. This model assumes a mass production of culture and identifies [[power (social and political)|power]] as residing with those producing [[cultural artifact]]s. In a Marxist view, those who control the [[means of production]] (the economic ''base'') essentially control a culture.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Other approaches to cultural studies, such as [[feminist]] cultural studies and later American developments of the field, distance themselves from this view. They criticize the Marxist assumption of a single, dominant meaning, shared by all, for any cultural product. The non-Marxist approaches suggest that different ways of consuming cultural artifacts affect the meaning of the product. This view comes through in the book ''Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman'' (by Paul du Gay ''et al.''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gX-kksNNdFIC|title=Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman|editor1-last=du Gay|editor1-first=Paul|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-0761954026|oclc=949857570|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; which seeks to challenge the notion that those who produce commodities control the meanings that people attribute to them. Feminist cultural analyst, theorist, and art historian [[Griselda Pollock]] contributed to cultural studies from viewpoints of [[art history]] and [[psychoanalysis]]. The writer [[Julia Kristeva]] is among influential voices at the turn of the century, contributing to cultural studies from the field of art and psychoanalytical [[French feminism]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Petrakis and Kostis (2013) divide cultural background variables into two main groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrakis|first=Panagiotis|last2=Kostis|first2=Pantelis|date=2013-12-01|title=Economic growth and cultural change|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053535713000218|journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics|volume=47|pages=147–57|doi=10.1016/j.socec.2013.02.011|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117193727/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053535713000218|archive-date=January 17, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The first group covers the variables that represent the "efficiency orientation" of the societies: performance orientation, [[future orientation]], assertiveness, power distance and uncertainty avoidance.
# The second covers the variables that represent the "social orientation" of societies, i.e., the attitudes and lifestyles of their members. These variables include gender egalitarianism, institutional collectivism, in-group collectivism and human orientation.
In 2016, a new approach to culture was suggested by [[Rein Raud]],&lt;ref name="meaning-in-action"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meaning in Action: Outline of an Integral Theory of Culture|last=Rein|first=Raud|publisher=[[Polity (publisher)|Polity]]|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1509511242|oclc=944339574|date = 2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; who defines culture as the sum of resources available to human beings for making sense of their world and proposes a two-tiered approach, combining the study of texts (all reified meanings in circulation) and cultural practices (all repeatable actions that involve the production, dissemination or transmission of meanings), thus making it possible to re-link anthropological and sociological study of culture with the tradition of textual theory.

[[File:Desire to Climb.jpg|thumb|right|A toddler having a desire to climb.]]
'''Desire''' is a sense of '''longing''' or hoping for a person, object, or outcome. The same sense is expressed by [[emotion]]s such as "'''craving'''". When a person desires something or someone, their sense of longing is excited by the enjoyment or the thought of the item or person, and they [[incentive salience|want]] to take actions to obtain their goal. The motivational aspect of desire has long been noted by philosophers; [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679) asserted that human desire is the fundamental motivation of all human action.

While desires are often classified as emotions by laypersons, [[Psychology|psychologists]] often describe desires as different from emotions; psychologists tend to argue that desires arise from bodily structures, such as the stomach's need for food, whereas emotions arise from a person's mental state. [[Marketing]] and advertising companies have used psychological research on how desire is stimulated to find more effective ways to induce consumers into buying a given product or service. While some advertising attempts to give buyers a sense of lack or wanting, other types of advertising create desire associating the product with desirable attributes, by showing either a celebrity or a model with the product.

The theme of desire is at the core of [[romance (heroic literature)|romance]] novels, which often create drama by showing cases where human desire is impeded by [[social convention]]s, [[Social class|class]], or cultural barriers. The theme of desire is also used in other literary genres, such as Gothic novels (e.g., ''[[Dracula]]'' by [[Bram Stoker]], in which desire is mingled with fear and dread). Poets ranging from [[Homer]] to [[Toni Morrison]] have dealt with the theme of desire in their work. Just as desire is central to the written fiction genre of romance, it is the central theme of [[melodrama]] films, which use plots that appeal to the heightened emotions of the audience by showing "crises of human emotion, failed romance or friendship", in which desire is thwarted or unrequited.

==In philosophy==
{{Main article|Philosophy of desire}}
[[File:Almeida Júnior - Saudade (Longing) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''[[Saudade]]'' (1899), by [[José Ferraz de Almeida Júnior]]]]

In philosophy, desire has been identified as a philosophical problem since Antiquity. In [[The Republic (Plato)|''The Republic'']], [[Plato]] argues that individual desires must be postponed in the name of the higher ideal. In ''[[De Anima]]'', [[Aristotle]] claims that desire is implicated in animal interactions and the propensity of animals to motion; at the same time, he acknowledges that reasoning also interacts with desire.

Hobbes (1588–1679) proposed the concept of [[psychological hedonism]], which asserts that the "fundamental motivation of all human action is the desire for pleasure." [[Baruch Spinoza]] (1632–1677) had a view which contrasted with Hobbes, in that "he saw natural desires as a form of bondage" that are not chosen by a person of their own [[free will]]. [[David Hume]] (1711–1776) claimed that desires and passions are non-cognitive, automatic bodily responses, and he argued that reasoning is "capable only of devising means to ends set by [bodily] desire".&lt;ref&gt;Ethics Chapter. ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' CD-ROM, V. 1.0, London: Routledge Edward Craig (ed). "Morality and emotions". By Martha C. Nussbaum&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) called any action based on desires a [[hypothetical imperative]], meaning by this that it is a command of reason that applies only if one desires the goal in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/159208/desire#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=desire%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia|title=desire - behaviour|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant also established a relation between the beautiful and pleasure in ''[[Critique of Judgment]]''. [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] claimed that "self-consciousness is desire".

Because desire can cause humans to become obsessed and embittered, it has been called one of the causes of woe for mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, Steve. ''Buddhism Plain and Simple''. New York: Broadway Books, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the teachings of Buddhism, [[tanha|craving]] is thought to be the cause of all [[dukkha|suffering]] that one experiences in human existence. The eradication of craving leads one to ultimate happiness, or [[Nirvana]]. However, desire for wholesome things is seen as liberating and enhancing.&lt;ref&gt;Charles S. Prebish, and Damien Keown, ''Buddhism - the EBook.'' Journal of Buddhist Ethics Online Books, 2005, page 83.&lt;/ref&gt; While the stream of desire for sense-pleasures must be cut eventually, a practitioner on the path to liberation is encouraged by the Buddha to "generate desire" for the fostering of skillful qualities and the abandoning of unskillful ones.&lt;ref name="this section"/&gt;

==In religion==
In [[Hinduism]], the Rig Veda's creation myth [[Nasadiya Sukta]] states regarding the one (ekam) spirit: "In the beginning there was Desire (kama) that was first seed of mind. Poets found the bond of being in non-being in their heart's thought".

In [[Buddhism]], for an individual to effect his or her liberation, the flow of sense-desire must be cut completely; however, while training, he or she must work with motivational processes based on skillfully applied desire.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Collins, ''Selfless Persons: Thought and Imagery in [[Theravada]] Buddhism''. Cambridge University Press, 1982, page 251: "In the end, the flowing streams of sense-desire must be 'cut' or 'crossed' completely; nevertheless, for the duration of the Path, a monk must perforce work with motivational and perceptual processes as they ordinarily are, that is to say, based on desire ... Thus, during mental training, the stream is not to be 'cut' immediately, but guided, like water along viaducts. The meditative steadying of the mind by counting in- and out-breaths (in the mindfulness of breathing) is compared to the steadying of a boat in 'a fierce current' by its rudder. The disturbance of the flow of a mountain stream by irrigation channels cut into its sides it used to illustrate the weakening of insight by the [[Five hindrances|five 'hindrances']]."&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Pāli Canon|early Buddhist scriptures]], the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] stated that monks should "generate desire" for the sake of fostering skillful qualities and abandoning unskillful ones.&lt;ref name="this section"&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, "[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/part2.html#part2-c The Wings to Awakening]".&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a double message here between what Buddha said, that desire must be created, and what some monks propose to their followers, that desire must be cut.
Truth is Buddhism entails two aspects: the ideas monks taught to civilize peasantry, on the one hand, and the esoteric teachings of tantra (aimed at leaders) for self-realization, on the other, where—just as Buddha said—desire must be generated.
Dr. [[Oscar R. Gómez]] holds that teachings imparted privately by H.H. [[14th Dalai Lama]] are meant for leaders to be able to choose a specific desire consciously by creating it previously from the inside. People have a tendency to live based on desires coming from the outside, and such desires are the ones making choices for them. As an alternative, tantric Tibetan Buddhism allows to choose a desire consciously; to create desire rather than being created by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gómez|first=Oscar R.|title=Manual of Tantra Vol III ...from tantra to the technology of desire|year=2009|publisher=''Editorial Menteclara''|isbn=978-987-24510-2-8|page=|edition=}} Read at: [https://www.academia.edu/19309143/Manual_de_Tantra_-_...desde_el_tantra_a_la_Tecnolog%C3%ADa_del_deseo_ Academia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Christianity, desire is seen as something that can either lead a person towards God and destiny or away from him. Desire is not considered to be a bad thing in and of itself; rather, it is a powerful force within the human that, once submitted to the Lordship of Christ, can become a tool for good, for advancement, and for abundant living.

===Neuropsychology===
{{main|Motivational salience}}
While desires are often classified as emotions by laypersons, psychologists often describe desires as different from emotions. For psychologists, desires arise from bodily structures and functions (e.g., the stomach needing food and the blood needing oxygen). On the other hand, emotions arise from a person's mental state. A 2008 study by the [[University of Michigan]] indicated that, while humans experience desire and [[fear]] as psychological opposites, they share the same brain circuit.&lt;ref&gt;"Changing stress levels can make brain flip from 'desire' to 'dread{{'"}}.  Mar. 19, 2008
http://www.ns.umich.edu/htdocs/releases/story.php?id=6419&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study entitled "The Neural Correlates of Desire" showed that the human brain categorizes stimuli according to its desirability by activating three different brain areas: the superior [[orbitofrontal cortex]], the mid-[[cingulate cortex]], and the [[anterior cingulate cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kawabata H, Zeki S | year = 2008 | title = The Neural Correlates of Desire | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 3 | issue = 8| page = e3027 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0003027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{npsn|date=September 2016}}

In [[affective neuroscience]], "desire" and "wanting" are operationally defined as [[motivational salience]];&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schultz W | year = 2015 | title = Neuronal reward and decision signals: from theories to data | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 95 | issue = 3 | pages = 853–951 | pmid = 26109341 | pmc = 4491543 | doi=10.1152/physrev.00023.2014 | quote = Rewards in operant conditioning are positive reinforcers.&amp;nbsp;... Operant behavior gives a good definition for rewards. Anything that makes an individual come back for more is a positive reinforcer and therefore a reward. Although it provides a good definition, positive reinforcement is only one of several reward functions.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards are attractive. They are motivating and make us exert an effort.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards induce approach behavior, also called appetitive or preparatory behavior, and consummatory behavior.&amp;nbsp;... Thus any stimulus, object, event, activity, or situation that has the potential to make us approach and consume it is by definition a reward.&amp;nbsp;... Rewarding stimuli, objects, events, situations, and activities consist of several major components. First, rewards have basic sensory components (visual, auditory, somatosensory, gustatory, and olfactory)&amp;nbsp;... Second, rewards are salient and thus elicit attention, which are manifested as orienting responses (FIGURE 1, middle). The salience of rewards derives from three principal factors, namely, their physical intensity and impact (physical salience), their novelty and surprise (novelty/surprise salience), and their general motivational impact shared with punishers (motivational salience). A separate form not included in this scheme, incentive salience, primarily addresses dopamine function in addiction and refers only to approach behavior (as opposed to learning)&amp;nbsp;... These emotions are also called liking (for pleasure) and wanting (for desire) in addiction research (471) and strongly support the learning and approach generating functions of reward.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAcc function"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-148127-4 | pages = 147–148, 367, 376 | edition = 2nd | quote= VTA DA neurons play a critical role in motivation, reward-related behavior (Chapter 15), attention, and multiple forms of memory.

Thus, acting in diverse terminal fields, dopamine confers motivational salience (“wanting”) on the reward itself or associated cues (nucleus accumbens shell region), updates the value placed on different goals in light of this new experience (orbital prefrontal cortex), helps consolidate multiple forms of memory (amygdala and hippocampus), and encodes new motor programs that will facilitate obtaining this reward in the future (nucleus accumbens core region and dorsal striatum). In this example, dopamine modulates the processing of sensorimotor information in diverse neural circuits to maximize the ability of the organism to obtain future rewards.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the form of "desire" or "wanting" associated with a [[rewarding stimulus]] (i.e., a stimulus which acts as a [[positive reinforcer]], such as [[Palatability|palatable food]], an attractive mate, or an [[addictive drug]]) is called "[[incentive salience]]" and research has demonstrated that incentive salience, the sensation of [[pleasure]], and [[positive reinforcement]] are all derived from [[neuron]]al activity within the [[reward system]].&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM Reward System" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system" /&gt; Studies have shown that [[dopamine]] [[signal transduction|signaling]] in the [[nucleus accumbens shell]] and [[endogenous opioid]] signaling in the [[ventral pallidum]] are at least partially responsible for mediating an individual's desire (i.e., incentive salience) for a rewarding stimulus and the subjective perception of pleasure derived from experiencing or "consuming" a rewarding stimulus (e.g., pleasure derived from eating palatable food, sexual pleasure from intercourse with an attractive mate, or [[euphoriant|euphoria from using an addictive drug]]).&lt;ref name="NAcc function" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM Reward System"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | pages = 365–366, 376 | chapter = Chapter 15: Reinforcement and Addictive Disorders | edition = 2nd | quote= The neural substrates that underlie the perception of reward and the phenomenon of positive reinforcement are a set of interconnected forebrain structures called brain reward pathways; these include the nucleus accumbens (NAc; the major component of the ventral striatum), the basal forebrain (components of which have been termed the extended amygdala, as discussed later in this chapter), hippocampus, hypothalamus, and frontal regions of cerebral cortex. These structures receive rich dopaminergic innervation from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain. Addictive drugs are rewarding and reinforcing because they act in brain reward pathways to enhance either dopamine release or the effects of dopamine in the NAc or related structures, or because they produce effects similar to dopamine.&amp;nbsp;... A macrostructure postulated to integrate many of the functions of this circuit is described by some investigators as the extended amygdala. The extended amygdala is said to comprise several basal forebrain structures that share similar morphology, immunocytochemical features, and connectivity and that are well suited to mediating aspects of reward function; these include the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the central medial amygdala, the shell of the NAc, and the sublenticular substantia innominata.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge KC, Kringelbach ML | title = Pleasure systems in the brain | journal = Neuron | volume = 86 | issue = 3 | pages = 646–664 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25950633 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2015.02.018 | quote = In the prefrontal cortex, recent evidence indicates that the OFC and insula cortex may each contain their own additional hot spots (D.C.

Successful confirmation of hedonic hot spots in the OFC or insula would be important and possibly relevant to the orbitofrontal mid-anterior site mentioned earlier that especially tracks the subjective pleasure of foods in humans (Georgiadis et al., 2012; Kringelbach, 2005; Kringelbach et al., 2003; Small et al., 2001; Veldhuizen et al., 2010). Finally, in the brainstem, a hindbrain site near the parabrachial nucleus of dorsal pons also appears able to contribute to hedonic gains of function (Söderpalm and Berridge, 2000). A brainstem mechanism for pleasure may seem more surprising than forebrain hot spots to anyone who views the brainstem as merely reflexive, but the pontine parabrachial nucleus contributes to taste, pain, and many visceral sensations from the body and has also been suggested to play an important role in motivation (Wu et al., 2012) and in human emotion (especially related to the somatic marker hypothesis) (Damasio, 2010). | pmc=4425246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Euphoria + pleasure circuitry"&gt;{{cite book | author=Kringelbach ML, Berridge KC | title=From Abuse to Recovery: Understanding Addiction | pages=199–207 | chapter=The Joyful Mind | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ITeFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT199&amp;q=euphoria#v=onepage&amp;q=euphoria&amp;f=false | accessdate=8 April 2016 | date=2013 | publisher=Macmillan | isbn=9781466842557 | quote = So it makes sense that the real pleasure centers in the brain—those directly responsible for generating pleasurable sensations—turn out to lie within some of the structures previously identified as part of the reward circuit.

The rewarding effects of drugs of abuse, development of incentive salience, and development of drug-seeking habits in the binge/intoxication stage involve changes in dopamine and opioid peptides in the basal ganglia. The increases in negative emotional states and dysphoric and stress-like responses in the withdrawal/negative affect stage involve decreases in the function of the dopamine component of the reward system and recruitment of brain stress neurotransmitters, such as corticotropin-releasing factor and dynorphin, in the neurocircuitry of the extended amygdala. The craving and deficits in executive function in the so-called preoccupation/anticipation stage involve the dysregulation of key afferent projections from the prefrontal cortex and insula, including glutamate, to the basal ganglia and extended amygdala. Molecular genetic studies have identified transduction and transcription factors that act in neurocircuitry associated with the development and maintenance of addiction that might mediate initial vulnerability, maintenance, and relapse associated with addiction.&amp;nbsp;... Substance-induced changes in transcription factors can also produce competing effects on reward function.&lt;sup&gt;141&lt;/sup&gt; For example, repeated substance use activates accumulating levels of ΔFosB, and animals with elevated ΔFosB exhibit exaggerated sensitivity to the rewarding eff ects of drugs of abuse, leading to the hypothesis that ΔFosB might be a sustained molecular trigger or switch that helps initiate and maintain a state of addiction.&lt;sup&gt;141,142&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research also shows that the orbitofrontal cortex has connections to both the opioid and dopamine systems, and stimulating this cortex is associated with subjective reports of pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Searching the brain for happiness |first=Morten L. |last=Kringelbach |work=BBC News |date=May 2, 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/happiness_formula/4880272.stm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019044816/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/happiness_formula/4880272.stm |archivedate=October 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychiatry===
Austrian psychiatrist [[Sigmund Freud]], who is best known for his theories of the unconscious mind and the defense mechanism of repression and for creating the clinical practice of psychoanalysis, proposed the notion of the [[Oedipus complex]], which argues that desire for the mother creates neuroses in their sons. Freud used the Greek myth of [[Oedipus]] to argue that people desire incest and must repress that desire. He claimed that children pass through several stages, including a stage in which they fixate on the mother as a sexual object.
That this "complex" is universal has long since been disputed.  Even if it were true, that would not explain those neuroses in daughters, but only in sons.  While it is true that sexual confusion ''can'' be aberrative in a few cases, there is no credible evidence to suggest that it is a universal scenario.  While Freud was correct in labeling the various symptoms behind most compulsions, phobias and disorders, he was largely incorrect in his theories regarding the [[etiology]] of what he identified.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url= http://www.iep.utm.edu/freud/ | title = Sigmund Freud (1856—1939) | publisher = The University of Tennessee, Martin | date  =  March 11, 2012| accessdate = January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French psychoanalyst and psychiatrist [[Jacques Lacan]] (1901–1981) argues that desire first occurs during a "mirror phase" of a baby's development, when the baby sees an image of wholeness in a mirror which gives them a desire for that being. As a person matures, Lacan claims that they still feel separated from themselves by language, which is incomplete, and so a person continually strives to become whole. He uses the term "[[jouissance]]" to refer to the lost object or feeling of absence which a person believes to be unobtainable. For more details on the Lacanian conception of desire, see [[desire (psychoanalysis)]]. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url= https://books.google.com.ng/books?isbn=020348732X | title = A Systemic Perspective on Cognition and Mathematics | publisher = Lin Forrest Publishers | date  =  June 30, 2013| accessdate = January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In marketing==
In the field of [[marketing]], desire is the human appetite for a given object of attention. Desire for a product is stimulated by advertising, which attempts to give buyers a sense of lack or wanting. In store retailing, merchants attempt to increase the desire of the buyer by showcasing the product attractively, in the case of clothes or jewellery, or, for food stores, by offering samples. With print, TV, and radio advertising, desire is created by giving the potential buyer a sense of lacking ("Are you still driving that old car?") or by associating the product with desirable attributes, either by showing a celebrity using or wearing the product, or by giving the product a "halo effect" by showing attractive models with the product. Nike's "Just Do It" ads for sports shoes are appealing to consumers' desires for self-betterment.

In some cases, the potential buyer already has the desire for the product before they enter the store, as in the case of a decorating buff entering their favorite furniture store. The role of the salespeople in these cases is simply to guide the customer towards making a choice; they do not have to try to "sell" the general idea of making a purchase, because the customer already wants the products. In other cases, the potential buyer does not have a desire for the product or service, and so the company has to create the sense of desire. An example of this situation is for life insurance. Most young adults are not thinking about dying, so they are not naturally thinking about how they need to have accidental death insurance. Life insurance companies, though, are attempting to create a desire for life insurance with advertising that shows pictures of children and asks "If anything happens to you, who will pay for the children's upkeep?".{{cn|date=February 2016}}

Marketing theorists call desire the third stage in the hierarchy of effects, which occurs when the buyer develops a sense that if they felt the need for the type of product in question, the advertised product is what would quench their desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914043251/http://www.marketing.org.au/default.aspx?i=o7/3rRJaaY0=&amp;t=jZS6ngCVPug=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction and art==
===Written fiction===
The theme of desire is at the core of the romance novel. Novels which are based around the theme of desire, which can range from a long aching feeling to an unstoppable torrent, include ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' by [[Gustave Flaubert]]; ''[[Love in the Time of Cholera]]'' by [[Gabriel Garcia Marquez]]; ''[[Lolita]]'' by [[Vladimir Nabokov]]; ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' by Charlotte Brontë, and ''[[Dracula]]'' by [[Bram Stoker]]. Brontë's characterization of Jane Eyre depicts her as torn by an inner conflict between reason and desire, because "customs" and "conventionalities" stand in the way of her romantic desires.&lt;ref&gt;''Desire, Class Position, and Gender in Jane Eyre and Pickwick Papers'' Benjamin Graves '97 (English 73 Brown University, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; [[E.M. Forster]]'s novels use homoerotic codes to describe same-sex desire and longing. Close male friendships with subtle homoerotic undercurrents occur in every novel, which subverts the conventional, heterosexual plot of the novels.&lt;ref&gt;Distant Desire: Homoerotic Codes and the Subversion of the English Novel in E.M. Forster's Fiction (Sexuality and Literature) by Parminder Kaur Bakshi&lt;/ref&gt; In  the Gothic-themed ''[[Dracula]]'', Stoker depicts the theme of desire which is coupled with fear. When the Lucy character is seduced by Dracula, she describes her sensations in the graveyard as a mixture of fear and blissful emotion.

Poet [[W.B. Yeats]] depicts the positive and negative aspects of desire in his poems such as "The Rose for the World", "Adam's Curse", "No Second Troy", "All Things can Tempt me", and "Meditations in Time of Civil War". Some poems depict desire as a poison for the soul; Yeats worked through his desire for his beloved, Maud Gonne, and realized that "Our longing, our craving, our thirsting for something other than Reality is what dissatisfies us". In "The Rose for the World", he admires her beauty, but feels pain because he cannot be with her. In the poem "No Second Troy", Yeats overflows with anger and bitterness because of their unrequited love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writing.colostate.edu/gallery/phantasmagoria/sepulveda.htm|title=Sepulveda - Desire: Can’t Live With It, Can’t Live Without It|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poet [[T. S. Eliot]] dealt with the themes of desire and homoeroticism in his poetry, prose and drama.&lt;ref&gt;Gender, Desire, and Sexuality in T. S. Eliot. Edited by Cassandra Laity. Drew University, New Jersey. Nancy K. Gish. University of Southern Maine ({{ISBN|978-0-521-80688-6}} | {{ISBN|0-521-80688-7}})&lt;/ref&gt; Other poems on the theme of desire include [[John Donne]]'s poem "To His Mistress Going to Bed", [[Carol Ann Duffy]]'s longings in "Warming Her Pearls"; [[Ted Hughes]]' "Lovesong" about the savage intensity of desire; and [[Wendy Cope]]'s humorous poem "Song".

Philippe Borgeaud's novels analyse how emotions such as erotic desire and seduction are connected to fear and wrath by examining cases where people are worried about issues of impurity, sin, and shame.

===Film===
Just as desire is central to the written fiction genre of romance, it is the central theme of [[melodrama]] films, which are a subgenre of the [[drama film]]. Like drama, a melodrama depends mostly on in-depth character development, interaction, and highly emotional themes. Melodramatic films tend to use plots that appeal to the heightened emotions of the audience. Melodramatic plots often deal with "crises of human emotion, failed romance or friendship, strained familial situations, tragedy, illness, neuroses, or emotional and physical hardship." Film critics sometimes use the term "pejoratively to connote an unrealistic, bathos-filled, campy tale of romance or domestic situations with stereotypical characters (often including a central female character) that would directly appeal to feminine audiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/melodramafilms.html|title=Melodramas Films|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also called "women's movies", "weepies", tearjerkers, or "chick flicks".

"Melodrama… is Hollywood's fairly consistent way of treating desire and subject identity", as can be seen in well-known films such as ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', in which "desire is the driving force for both Scarlett and the hero, Rhett". Scarlett desires love, money, the attention of men, and the vision of being a virtuous "true lady". Rhett Butler desires to be with Scarlett, which builds to a burning longing that is ultimately his undoing, because Scarlett keeps refuses his advances; when she finally confesses her secret desire, Rhett is worn out and his longing is spent.

In Cathy Cupitt's article on "Desire and Vision in Blade Runner", she argues that film, as a "visual narrative form, plays with the voyeuristic desires of its audience". Focusing on the dystopian 1980s science fiction film ''[[Blade Runner]]'', she calls the film an "Object of Visual Desire", in which it plays to an "expectation of an audience's delight in visual texture, with the 'retro-fitted' spectacle of the post-modern city to ogle" and with the use of the "motif of the 'eye'". In the film, "desire is a key motivating influence on the narrative of the film, both in the 'real world', and within the text."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/area51/hollow/2405/blade.html |title=Cathy Cupitt, ''Eyeballing the Simulacra Desire and Vision in Blade Runner'' |accessdate=2017-03-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991022015016/http://www.geocities.com/area51/hollow/2405/blade.html |archivedate=October 22, 1999 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary spiritual perspective==
{{Importance section|date=May 2014}}
[[Barry Long]] defined desire as stress or strain. It is a tension between an individual and the thing or state that that individual desires. As the thing does not feel this stress, the desiring is a one-way tension within the individual, an apparent reaching out towards the desired object or person.

When the person responds in the way desired, or the object is attained, the desire settles down into a relationship. A relationship is identifiable by the presence of an attitude in yourself which reacts in terms of "mine".

When a desire has been reduced to the level of a habit or idea it can be dealt with and eliminated fairly quickly by observation - seeing it for what it is. In that moment you suddenly realise you are free of the relationship as a need or dependence "of mine".&lt;ref&gt;Barry Long, ''Knowing Yourself'' (pp 102 - 103)&lt;/ref&gt;

Pictured is a road sign in India, with the [[Perso-Arabic script]] above and the [[Devanagari script]] below, with an English translation at the bottom.]]
In [[sociolinguistics]], '''digraphia''' refers to the use of more than one [[writing system]] for the same language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dale |first=Ian R.H. |title=Digraphia |journal=International Journal of the Sociology of Language |volume=26 |pages=5–13 |year=1980 |doi=10.1515/ijsl.1980.26.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  '''Synchronic digraphia''' is the coexistence of two or more writing systems for the same language, while '''diachronic (or sequential) digraphia''' is the replacement of one writing system by another for a particular language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cheung |first=Yat-Shing |chapter=The form and meaning of digraphia: the case of Chinese |title=Sociolinguistics Today: International Perspectives |editors=K.

An example of [[Synchronic analysis|synchronic]] digraphia is [[Serbian language|Serbian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ivković | first1 = Dejan | year = 2013 | title = Pragmatics meets ideology: Digraphia and non-standard orthographic practices in Serbian online news forums | url = | journal = Journal of Language and Politics | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 335–356 | doi = 10.1075/jlp.12.3.02ivk }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is equally written in both [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]] and [[Gaj's Latin alphabet]], and practically all speakers of Serbian can read and write both scripts. Another example is [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] which uses two different writing systems: [[Gurmukhi script]], used in Punjab in India, and [[Shahmukhi alphabet|Shahmukhi]] (an Arabic script), though there is no difference when both of these scripts are read or pronounced. [[Konkani]] is written in no fewer than three scripts; [[Devnagari]], [[Kannada script|Kannada]] and [[Roman script|Roman]]. 

An example of [[Diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] digraphia is [[Turkish language|Turkish]], which replaced a [[Perso-Arabic]] writing system with a Latin-based system in 1928.

Digraphia has implications in [[language planning]], [[language policy]], and [[language ideology]].

==Terminology==
''Digraphia'' "using two writing systems for the same language" is an uncommon term, generally restricted to linguistic contexts.

===Etymology===
English [[wikt:digraphia|''digraphia'']], like [[French language|French]] [[wikt:digraphie|''digraphie'']], [[etymology|etymologically]] derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''di-'' [[wikt:δι-|''δι-'']] "twice" and ''-graphia'' [[wikt:-γραφία|''-γραφία'']] "writing".

''Digraphia'' was modeled upon [[wikt:diglossia|''diglossia'']] "the coexistence of two languages or dialects among a certain population", which derives from Greek ''diglossos'' [[wikt:δίγλωσσος|δίγλωσσος]] "bilingual." [[Charles A. Ferguson]], a founder of [[sociolinguistics]],  coined ''diglossia'' in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferguson | first1 = Charles A | year = 1959 | title = Diglossia | url = | journal = Word | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 325–340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grivelet analyzes how the influence of diglossia on the unrelated notion of digraphia has "introduced some distortion in the process of defining digraphia," such as distinguishing "high" and "low" varieties.&lt;ref&gt;Grivelet (2001), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Unseth notes one usage of "digraphia" that most closely parallels Ferguson’s “diglossia,” situations where a language uses different scripts for different domains; for instance, "shorthand in English, [[pinyin]] in Chinese for alphabetizing library files, etc. or several scripts which are replaced by Roman script during e-mail usage."&lt;ref&gt;Unseth (2005), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which does not yet include ''digraphia'', enters two ''digraph'' terms and ''digraphic''.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' (2009). 2nd ed., v. 4.0.&lt;/ref&gt; First, the [[linguistic]] term ''digraph'' is defined as, "A group of two letters expressing a simple sound of speech". This meaning applies to both two letters representing a single speech sound in [[Digraph (orthography)|orthography]] (e.g., English ''ng'' representing the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|/ŋ/}}) and a single [[grapheme]] with two letters in [[Typographical ligature#Digraphs|typographical ligature]] (e.g., the [[Old English Latin alphabet]] letter [[æ]]). Second, the [[graph theory]] term ''digraph'' (a [[portmanteau]] from [[directed graph]]) is defined as, "A graph in which each line has a direction associated with it; a finite, non-empty set of elements together with a set of ordered pairs of these elements." The two ''digraph'' terms were first recorded in 1788 and 1955, respectively. The ''OED2'' defines two ''digraphic'' meanings, "Pertaining to or of the nature of a digraph" and "Written in two different characters or alphabets." It gives their earliest examples in 1873 and 1880 (which was used meaning "digraphia"). [[Isaac Hollister Hall]], an American scholar of [[Oriental studies]], described an [[Eteocypriot language]] publication as "bilingual (or digraphic, as both inscriptions are in the same language)."&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Isaac Hollister (1880). "The Cypriote Inscriptions". ''[[Scribner's Monthly]]'', vol. 20, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4YwPAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA205#v=onepage&amp;q=digraphic&amp;f=false p. 205].&lt;/ref&gt; Hall's article was antedated by [[Demetrios Pieridis]]'s 1875 usage of ''digraphic'' instead of ''bilingual'' for an inscription written in both the [[Greek alphabet]] and [[Cypriot syllabary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pierides | first1 = Demetrios | year = 1875 | title = On a digraphic inscription found in Larnaca | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ursMAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;ots=gypDUe5UVx&amp;dq=On%20a%20digraphic%20inscription%20found%20in%20Larnaca&amp;pg=PA38 | journal = Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 38–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

English ''digraphic'' and ''digraphia'' were contemporaneous with their corresponding terms in French linguistics. In 1877, [[Julius Oppert]] introduced ''digraphique'' to describe languages written in [[cuneiform]] syllabaries.&lt;ref&gt;Oppert, Jules (1877). [Review of] François Lenormant, Études sur quelques parties des syllabaires cunéiformes, Paris 1877; idem, Les syllabaires cunéiformes, Paris 1877. Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen 1877(45–46). 1409–1449.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, [[Auguste Barth]] used French ''digraphisme'' for Cambodian inscriptions written in [[Khmer script]] and [[Brāhmī script]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergaigne, Abel (1893). Inscriptions sanscrites du Cambodge [edited and commented by Auguste Barth]. Notices et extraits des manuscrits de la Bibliothèque Nationale et autres bibliothèques 27(1). 293–588.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, [[Robèrt Lafont]] coined ''digraphie'' regarding the sociolinguistics of French and [[Occitan language|Occitan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lafont | first1 = Robert | year = 1971 | title = Un problème de culpabilité sociologique: La diglossie franco-occitane | url = http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/lfr_0023-8368_1971_num_9_1_5576 | journal = Langue française | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 93–99 | doi=10.3406/lfr.1971.5576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the word "digraphia" is new, the practice is ancient. [[Darius the Great]]'s (c. 522-486 BCE) [[Behistun Inscription]] was written in three [[cuneiform script]]s for [[Old Persian]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], and [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Unseth | first1 = Peter | year = 2005 | title = Sociolinguistic parallels between choosing scripts and languages | url = | journal = Written Language &amp; Literacy | volume = 8 | issue = 1| page = 36 | doi=10.1075/wll.8.1.02uns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neologizers===
Four authors independently neologized English ''digraphia'' from ''diglossia''.

The [[Songhay languages|Songhay]] [[linguist]] Petr Zima (1974) first used "digraphia" to describe the [[Hausa language]] having two writing systems, [[Boko (alphabet)|Boko]] ([[Latin script]]) and [[Ajami script]] ([[Arabic script]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zima | first1 = Petr | year = 1974 | title = Digraphia: The case of Hausa | url = http://related.springerprotocols.com/lp/de-gruyter/digraphia-the-case-of-hausa-ZFtJZ8w2Kk | journal = Linguistics | volume = 124 | issue = | pages = 57–69 | doi=10.1515/ling.1974.12.124.57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zima differentiated these paired situations.
*''Digraphia'': "Two types of written form of one language co-exist, based upon the usage of two distinct graphical systems (scripts) by the respective language community."
*''Diorthographia'': "Two types of written form of a particular language co-exist, using the same script, but they are based upon the usage of two distinct orthographies by the same language community."&lt;ref&gt;Zima (1974), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
Usage of "diorthographia" is unusual. Compare [[dysgraphia]] meaning "a language disorder that affects a person's ability to write" and [[dysorthographia]] "a synonym for [[dyslexia]]".

The [[anthropologist]] James R. Jaquith (1976), who studied unconventional spelling in advertising, used "digraphia" to describe the practice of writing brand names in [[all caps]] (e.g., [[Arrid|ARRID]]). He described digraphia as "the graphic analog of what linguists call diglossia", and defined it as "different versions of a written language exist simultaneously and in complementary distribution in a speech community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jaquith | first1 = James R | year = 1976 | title = Digraphia in advertising: The public as guinea pig | url = | journal = Visible Language | volume = 10 | issue = 4| page = 303 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sociolinguist]] Ian R. H. Dale (1980) wrote a general survey of digraphia, defined as, "the use of two (or more) writing systems to represent varieties of a single language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dale | first1 = Ian R. H. | year = 1980 | title = Digraphia | url = http://uk-online.uni-koeln.de/remarks/d5134/rm2173940.doc | journal = International Journal of the Sociology of Language | volume = 26 | issue =  | pages = 5–13 | doi = 10.1515/ijsl.1980.26.5 | access-date = 2011-08-30 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111007201951/http://uk-online.uni-koeln.de/remarks/d5134/rm2173940.doc | archive-date = 2011-10-07 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sinologist]] and [[lexicographer]] [[John DeFrancis]] (1984) used ''digraphia'', defined as "the use of two or more different systems of writing the same language," to translate Chinese ''shuangwenzhi'' (雙文制 "two-script system") of writing in [[Chinese characters]] and [[Pinyin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DeFrancis | first1 = John | year = 1984 | title = Digraphia | url = | journal = Word | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 59–66 | doi=10.1080/00437956.1984.11435748}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DeFrancis later explained, "I have been incorrectly credited with coining the term ''digraphia'', which I indeed thought I had created as a parallel in writing to Charles Ferguson’s ''diglossia'' in speech."&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis, John (2006). [http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp171_chinese_writing_reform.pdf Prospects for Chinese Writing Reform], ''[[Sino-Platonic Papers]]'' 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegyi coined and suggested the terms "bigraphism" and "multigraphism",&lt;ref&gt;Hegyi, O. 1979. Minority and restricted uses of the Arabic alphabet: the aljamiado phenomenon. ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' Vol. 99, No. 2:262-269.&lt;/ref&gt; but he only used them in a footnote (fn. 17, p. 268) and did not promote the use of either of these terms, nor follow up on his insights into the importance of studying "the use of two or more different writing systems for the same language... such cases have been more widespread than commonly assumed."

===Usage===
''Digraphia'' is an uncommon term in current English usage. For instance, the [[Corpus of Contemporary American English]], which includes over 425,000,000 words, lists ''digraphia'' three times in "academic genre" contexts.
 
Stéphane Grivelet, who edited a special "Digraphia: Writing systems and society" issue of the ''[[International Journal of the Sociology of Language]]'', explains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grivelet | first1 = Stéphane | year = 2001 | title = Introduction", "Digraphia: Writing systems and society | url = | journal = International Journal of the Sociology of Language | volume = 150 | issue = | pages = 1–10 | doi=10.1515/ijsl.2001.037}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;After 25 years and various articles on the subject, there are still important differences in the scope of the definition, and the notion itself is rarely used in sociolinguistics, apart from the field of Chinese studies, where the notion of digraphia is nowadays frequently used to describe the coexistence of two writing systems: Chinese script and Pinyin.&lt;ref&gt;Grivelet (2001), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Digraphia''' has some rare synonyms. '''Orthographic diglossia''' antedates digraphia, and was noted by Paul Wexler in 1971."&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, Paul (1971). "Diglossia, language standardization and purism." ''Lingua'' 27, 340. "Orthographic differences are not always a reflection of ethnocultural differences and multiple standards. Different scripts may be used by a single ethnic group for different purposes (e.g., secular versus religious literature), in which case we could speak of 'orthographic diglossia'."&lt;/ref&gt; '''Bigraphism''', '''bialphabetism''', and '''biscriptality''' are infrequently used.

Some scholars avoid using the word "digraphia". Describing terminology for "script obsolescence," [[Stephen D. Houston]], [[John Baines (Egyptologist)|John Baines]], and Jerrold Cooper say, "'Biscript' refers to a text in two different writing systems. 'Biliteracy' and 'triliteracy' label the concurrent use of two or three scripts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Houston |first1=S. |last2=Baines |first2=J. |last3=Cooper |first3=J. |year=2003 |title=Last writing: Script obsolescence in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Mesoamerica |url=http://neareast.jhu.edu/bin/g/o/jc%20Last%20Writing.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |volume=45 |issue=3 |page=432 |doi=10.1017/s0010417503000227 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical aspects==
Digraphia can be either "synchronic" (or "concurrent") or "diachronic" ("historical" or "sequential"),&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis (1984), p. 60 uses concurrent and sequential.&lt;/ref&gt; extending [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s classic division between [[synchronic analysis (linguistics)|synchronic linguistics]] and  [[historical linguistics|diachronic linguistics]]. Dale first differentiated "diachronic (or historical) digraphia" ("more than one writing system used for a given language in successive periods of time") and "synchronic digraphia" ("more than one writing system used contemporaneously for the same language").&lt;ref&gt;Dale (1980), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Dale concluded that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Two primary factors have been identified as operating on a society in the choice of script for representing its language. These are the prevailing cultural influence (often a religion) and the prevailing political influence of the period in which the choice is made. Synchronic digraphia results when more than one such influence is operating and none can dominate all groups of speakers of the language in question [ … ] Diachronic digraphia results when different influences prevail over a given speech community at different times.&lt;ref&gt;Dale (1980), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some recent scholarship questions the practicality of this synchronic/diachronic distinction. Grivelet contends that, "digraphia is a single sociolinguistic process with two types of outcome (concurrent or sequential digraphia) and with specific features related to the causes and types of development of the various cases.&lt;ref&gt;Grivelet (2001), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Unseth lists and exemplifies four factors that can influence a language community's choice of a script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Unseth | first1 = Peter | year = 2005 | title = Sociolinguistic parallels between choosing scripts and languages | url = | journal = Written Language &amp; Literacy | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 22–29 | doi=10.1075/wll.8.1.02uns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#"To identify themselves with a group." In the 1940s, Mongolia replaced the traditional [[Mongolian script]] first briefly with the [[Mongolian Latin alphabet]] and then, under Soviet influence, with the [[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet]]. From the 1980s, the Mongolian script was reintroduced into schools for its historical and cultural importance.
#"To distance themselves from a group." In the mid-19th century, the LDS Church developed and promoted the [[Deseret alphabet]] for English. [[Brigham Young]] publicly claimed it was more phonetically accurate than Latin script and would facilitate learning to read and write English. However, historian David Bigler says the Deseret alphabet "demonstrated cultural exclusivism, an important consideration. It also kept secrets from curious non-Mormons, [and] controlled what children would be allowed to read."&lt;ref&gt;Bigler, David (1998). ''Forgotten kingdom: the Mormon theocracy in the American West, 1847–1896'', p. 56. Arthur Clark.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Participation in developments on a broader scale. The choice of a script can influence a group's preparedness to interact with other regional or international groups. For instance, the [[Hmong language]] has numerous alternate writing systems. Hmong who live in Southeast Asia prefer the indigenous [[Romanized Popular Alphabet]] (RPA) or the [[Pahawh Hmong]] [[semi-syllabary]]; Hmong expatriates who live in the United States prefer to romanize names differently, such as Latin ''Hmong'' instead of RPA ''Hmoob''.
#"Linguistic considerations." Sometimes a foreign script is rejected because it is unsuitable for the phonetics of a language. [[Korean language|Korean]] was first written in logographic ''[[Hanja]]'' Chinese characters, but king [[Sejong the Great]] promulgated the [[Hangul]] alphabet, which is better suited for transcribing [[Korean phonology]]. In the present day, [[South Korea]]n uses both ''Hanja'' logographs and ''Hangul'' letters, while [[North Korea]] uses only ''Hangul''.

Linguists who study [[language and gender]] have analyzed gender-differentiated speech varieties ("genderlects", usually spoken by women), and there are a few cases of scripts predominantly used by women. Japanese ''hiragana'' was initially a women's script, for instance, used by [[Murasaki Shikibu]] to write ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''. Chinese [[Nüshu script]] (literally "women's writing) is a simplification of characters that was traditionally used by women in [[Jiangyong County]] of [[Hunan]] province.&lt;ref&gt;Unseth (2005), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only scripts, but also letters can have iconic power to differentiate social groups. For example, the names of many [[heavy metal bands]] (e.g., [[Motörhead]], [[Infernäl Mäjesty]], [[Mötley Crüe]]) use umlauts "to index the musical genre as well as the notion of ‘Gothic’ more generally."&lt;ref&gt;Sebba (2009), p 40.&lt;/ref&gt; This digraphic usage is called the "[[metal umlaut]]" (or "röck döts").

==Synchronic digraphia==
''Synchronic digraphia'' is the coexistence of two or more writing systems for the same language. A modern example is the [[Serbian language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ivković | first1 = Dejan | year = 2013 | title = Pragmatics meets ideology: Digraphia and non-standard orthographic practices in Serbian online news forums | url = | journal = Journal of Language and Politics | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 335–356 | doi = 10.1075/jlp.12.3.02ivk }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is written in either the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]] or [[Gaj's Latin alphabet]]. Although most speakers can read and write both scripts, Roman Catholic Croatians and Muslim [[Bosniaks]] generally use Latin, while Orthodox Serbians commonly use both. However, older indigenous scripts were used much earlier, most notably [[Bosnian Cyrillic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trager | first1 = George L | year = 1974 | title = Writing and writing systems | url = | journal = Current Trends in Linguistics | volume = 12 | issue = | page = 413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inuktitut]] is also officially digraphic, using both Latin and [[Inuktitut syllabics]]. In [[Hindi-Urdu]], the [[Devanagari]] or [[Persian script]] generally follows the [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]] standards and the speaker's religious affiliation, though Urdu is sometimes written in Devanagari in India. Digraphia is limited, however, in that most people know only one script.

The [[Japanese writing system]] has unusually complex digraphia. William C. Hannas distinguishes two digraphic forms of Japanese: "true digraphia" of occasionally using ''[[rōmaji]]'' Latin alphabet for a few [[loanwords]] like ''DVD'', and of regularly using three scripts (technically, "trigraphia") for different functions. Japanese is written with ''[[kanji]]'' "Chinese character" [[Logogram|logographs]] used for [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]]; ''[[hiragana]]'' used for native Japanese words; and ''[[katakana]]'' used for foreign borrowings or graphic emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;Hannas, William C. (1997). ''Asia's Orthographic Dilemma''. University of Hawaii Press, pp. 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt; Take ''Nihon'' for instance, the primary [[Names of Japan|name of Japan]]. It is normally written 日本 (literally, "sun's origin") in ''kanji'' – but is occasionally written にほん in ''hiragana'', ニホン in ''katakana'', or Nihon in ''[[rōmaji]]'' ("romanization"). Japanese users having a certain amount of flexibility in choosing between scripts, and their choices can have social meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sebba | first1 = Mark | year = 2009 | title = Sociolinguistic approaches to writing systems research | url = | journal = Writing Systems Research | volume = 1 | issue = 1| page = 38 | doi=10.1093/wsr/wsp002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Berontoseno Arabica Coffee 250gr in Multiscript.jpg|thumb|247x247px|The use of Javanese script, [[Pegon script|Pegon]] (modified Arabic script) and Latin alphabet for coffee packaging in Indonesia saying ''100% Pure Coffee Powder''.]]
Another example is the [[Malay language]], which most often uses the [[Latin alphabet]], while in certain geographic areas ([[Kelantan]] state of Malaysia, [[Brunei]]) it is also written with an adapted Arabic alphabet called [[Jawi script|Jawi]]. Adaptation of Arabic script is also widely used across [[Malay Archipelago]] since the introduction of [[Islam]]. In Java, [[Javanese people|Javanese]] people, which predominantly ruled by [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddha]] kingdoms, have their own writing system called [[Javanese script|Hanacaraka]]. When Islamic power took place, modified Arabic writing system (called [[Pegon script|Pegon]]) was introduced, alongside with the massive introduction of Latin alphabet by western colonialists. This results in the use of three writing systems to write modern Javanese, either based on a particular context (religious, cultural or normal), or sometimes also written simultaneously. This phenomenon also occurred in some other cultures in Indonesia.

An element of synchronic digraphia is present in many languages not using the Latin script, in particular in text messages and when typing on a computer which does not have the facility to represent the usual script for that language. In such cases, Latin script is often used, although systems of transcription are often not standardised.

Digraphia is controversial in modern [[Written Chinese]]. The ongoing [[debate on traditional and simplified Chinese characters]] concerns "diglyphia" or "[[Pluricentric language|pluricentricity]]" rather than digraphia. Chinese digraphia involves the use of both [[Chinese characters]] and [[Hanyu Pinyin]] romanization. Pinyin is officially approved for a few special uses, such as annotating characters for learners of Chinese and transcribing Chinese names.&lt;ref&gt;Xieyan Hincha (2004). [http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp134_chinese_digraphia.pdf Two Steps Toward Digraphia in China]. ''Sino-Platonic Papers'' 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Pinyin continues to be adopted for other functions, such as computers, education, library catalogs, and merchandise labels.&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis (1984), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[Chinese input methods for computers]], [[Pinyin input method|Pinyin]] is the most popular phonetic method. [[Zhou Youguang]] predicts, "Digraphia is perhaps the key for Chinese to enter the age of Information processing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Youguang | first1 = Zhou | year = 1986 | title = Modernization of the Chinese Language | url = http://plosjournal.deepdyve.com/lp/de-gruyter/modernization-of-the-chinese-language-SmsCBMDYNZ | journal = International Journal of the Sociology of Language | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 7–23 | doi=10.1515/ijsl.1986.59.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many writers, both from China (e.g., [[Mao Dun]] and Zhou Youguang) and from abroad (e.g., John DeFrancis, [[Victor H. Mair]], [[J. Marshall Unger]], and William Hannas&lt;ref&gt;Hannas, William C. (1997). ''Asia's Orthographic Dilemma''. University of Hawaii Press.&lt;/ref&gt;) have argued for digraphia to be implemented as a Chinese language standard. These digraphic reformers call for a generalized used of Pinyin orthography along with Chinese characters. 
Yat-Shing Cheung differentiates three Chinese digraphic situations. (1) Both the High and the Low forms derive from the same script system: traditional and simplified characters. (2) Both forms derive from the same system but the Low form borrows foreign elements: [[Putonghua]] and topolects (or "dialects"). (3) The High and the Low forms derive from two different script systems: Chinese characters and pinyin.&lt;ref&gt;Cheung, Yat-Shing (1992). "The form and meaning of digraphia: the case of Chinese". In K. Bolton and H. Kwok. ''Sociolinguistics Today: International Perspectives''. 210-215. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diachronic digraphia==
"Diachronic" or "sequential digraphia", in which a language switches writing systems, can occur historically through [[language change]] or suddenly through [[language reform]]. "Abrupt script shift can be seen in the change of Turkish from Arabic script to Roman (in one year), while a gradual change of script can be seen in the change from writing Korean in Chinese characters to Hangul (a process that arguably nearly spanned five centuries)."&lt;ref&gt;Unseth (2005), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Azerbaijani language]] provides an "extreme example" of diachronic digraphia; it has historically been written in [[Runic alphabet|runic]], Arabic, Latin, Cyrillic, and again Latin alphabets.&lt;ref&gt;Unseth (2005), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher, Lynley. 2008. Script change in Azerbaijan: acts of identity. ''International Journal of the Sociology of Language'' 192:105–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many examples of languages that used to be written in a script, which was replaced later. Examples are [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (which originally used [[Cyrillic]] and changed to [[Latin alphabet|Latin]]) in the 1860s; [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] (which switched from a form of Chinese writing called [[Chữ Nôm]] to the Latin alphabet); [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Somali language|Somali]], and (partially) [[Malay language|Malay]], which all switched from [[Arabic script]] to the [[Latin alphabet]], and many countries of the former Soviet Union, which abandoned the [[Cyrillic]] script after the dissolution of the [[USSR]] such as [[Moldova]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]] all switched from Cyrillic to Latin. DeFrancis notes, "The old literature in the earlier scripts remains, however, so that all these scripts more or less overlap in use, by scholars involved with early texts, or for reprinting earlier materials for a wider readership and for other limited uses."&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis (1984), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7864">In [[abstract algebra]], the '''endomorphism ring''' of an [[abelian group]] ''X'', denoted by End(''X''), is the set of all [[endomorphism]]s of ''X'' (i.e., the set of all [[homomorphism]]s of ''X'' into itself) endowed with an addition operation defined by [[Pointwise#Pointwise operations|pointwise]] addition of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] and a multiplication operation defined by [[function composition]]. Using these operations, the set of endomorphisms of an abelian group forms a (unital) [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]], with the [[zero map]] as [[additive identity]] and the [[identity map]] as   [[multiplicative identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Passman|1991|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The functions involved are restricted to what is defined as a homomorphism in the context, which depends upon the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of the object under consideration. The endomorphism ring consequently encodes several internal properties of the object. As the resulting object is often an [[algebra (ring theory)|algebra]] over some ring ''R,'' this may also be called the '''endomorphism algebra'''.

==Description==
Let {{nowrap|(''A'', +)}} be an abelian group and we consider the group homomorphisms from ''A'' into ''A''. Then addition of two such homomorphisms may be defined pointwise to produce another group homomorphism. Explicitly, given two such homomorphisms ''f'' and ''g'', the sum of ''f'' and ''g'' is the homomorphism {{nowrap|1=(''f'' + ''g'')(''x'') := ''f''(''x'') + ''g''(''x'')}}. Under this operation End(''A'') is an abelian group. With the additional operation of composition of homomorphisms, End(''A'') is a ring with multiplicative identity. This composition is explicitly {{nowrap|1=(''fg'')(''x'') := ''f''(''g''(''x''))}}. The multiplicative identity is the identity homomorphism on ''A''.

If the set ''A'' does not form an ''abelian'' group, then the above construction is not necessarily [[Additive map|additive]], as then the sum of two homomorphisms need not be a homomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Dummit|Foote|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set of endomorphisms is a canonical example of a [[near-ring]] that is not a ring.

== Properties ==
* Endomorphism rings always have additive and multiplicative [[identity element|identities]], respectively the [[zero map]] and [[identity function|identity map]].
* Endomorphism rings are [[associative]], but typically [[non-commutative ring|non-commutative]].
* If a module is [[simple module|simple]], then its endomorphism ring is a [[division ring]] (this is sometimes called [[Schur's lemma]]).{{sfn|Jacobson| 2009|loc=p. 118}}
* A module is [[indecomposable module|indecomposable]] if and only if its endomorphism ring does not contain any non-trivial [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent element]]s.{{sfn|Jacobson|2009|loc=p. 111, Prop. 3.1}} If the module is an [[injective module]], then indecomposability is equivalent to the endomorphism ring being a [[local ring]].{{sfn|Wisbauer|1991|loc=p.163}}
* For a [[semisimple module]], the endomorphism ring is a [[von Neumann regular ring]].
* The endomorphism ring of a nonzero right [[uniserial module]] has either one or two maximal right ideals. If the module is Artinian, Noetherian, projective or injective, then the endomorphism ring has a unique maximal ideal, so that it is a local ring.
* The endomorphism ring of an Artinian [[uniform module]] is a local ring.{{sfn|Wisbauer|1991|loc=p. 263}}
* The endomorphism ring of a module with finite [[composition length]] is a [[semiprimary ring]].
* The endomorphism ring of a [[continuous module]] or [[discrete module]] is a [[clean ring]].{{sfn|Camillo|Khurana|Lam|Nicholson|2006}}
* If an ''R'' module is finitely generated and projective (that is, a [[progenerator]]), then the endomorphism ring of the module and ''R'' share all Morita invariant properties. A fundamental result of Morita theory is that all rings equivalent to ''R'' arise as endomorphism rings of progenerators.

* In the category of ''R'' [[module (mathematics)|module]]s the endomorphism ring of an ''R''-module ''M'' will only use the ''R'' [[module homomorphism]]s, which are typically a proper subset of the abelian group homomorphisms.&lt;ref&gt;Abelian groups may also be viewed as modules over the ring of integers.&lt;/ref&gt; When ''M'' is a [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] [[projective module]], the endomorphism ring is central to [[Morita equivalence]] of module categories.
* For any abelian group &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M_n(\operatorname{End}(A))\cong \operatorname{End}(A^n)&lt;/math&gt;, since any matrix in &lt;math&gt;M_n(\operatorname{End}(A))&lt;/math&gt; carries a natural homomorphism structure of &lt;math&gt;A^n&lt;/math&gt; as follows: 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}\phi_{11}&amp;\cdots &amp;\phi_{1n}\\ \vdots&amp; &amp;\vdots \\ \phi_{n1}&amp;\cdots&amp; \phi_{nn}  \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}a_1\\\vdots\\a_n\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\sum_{i=1}^n\phi_{1i}(a_i)\\\vdots\\\sum_{i=1}^n\phi_{ni}(a_i) \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;. 
:One can use this isomorphism to construct a lot of non-commutative endomorphism rings. For example: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}(\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z})\cong M_2(\mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}(\mathbb{Z})\cong \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.  
:Also, when &lt;math&gt;R=K&lt;/math&gt; is a field, there is a canonical isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}(K)\cong K&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}(K^n)\cong M_n(K)&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the endomorphism ring of a &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;-vector space is identified with the [[matrix ring|ring of ''n''-by-''n'' matrices]] with entries in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;.{{sfn|Drozd|Kirichenko|1994|loc=pp. 23–31}} More generally, the endomorphism algebra of the [[free module]] &lt;math&gt;M = R^n&lt;/math&gt; is naturally &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-by-&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; matrices with entries in the ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.
*As a particular example of the last point, for any ring ''R'' with unity, {{nowrap|1=End(''R''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''R''}}, where the elements of ''R'' act on ''R'' by ''left'' multiplication.
*In general, endomorphism rings can be defined for the objects of any [[preadditive category]].

The '''Eocyte hypothesis''' is a [[biological classification]] that indicates [[eukaryote]]s emerged within the [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] [[Crenarchaeota]] (formerly known as eocytes), a phylum within the [[archaea]]. This hypothesis was originally proposed by [[James A. Lake]] and colleagues in 1984 based on the discovery that the shapes of [[ribosome]]s in the Crenarchaeota and eukaryotes are more similar to each other than to either [[bacteria]] or the second major kingdom of archaea, the [[Euryarchaeota]].&lt;ref name=Archibald&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John M. |last1=Archibald |title=The eocyte hypothesis and the origin of eukaryotic cells  |journal=PNAS |volume=105 |issue=51 |pages=20049–20050 |date=23 December 2008 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/51/20049.full |accessdate=5 October 2012 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0811118106|pmid=19091952 |bibcode=2008PNAS..10520049A |pmc=2629348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lake&gt;{{cite journal |first1=James A. |last1= Lake |first2=Eric |last2=Henderson |first3=Melanie |last3=Oakes |first4=Michael W. |last4=Clark |title=Eocytes: A new ribosome structure indicates a kingdom with a close relationship to eukaryotes |journal=PNAS |volume=81 |pages=3786–3790 |date=June 1984 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/81/12/3786.short |accessdate=5 October 2012 |issue=12 |doi=10.1073/pnas.81.12.3786 |pmid=6587394 |pmc=345305|bibcode=1984PNAS...81.3786L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eocyte hypothesis.png|thumb|left|Schematic representation]]
The eocyte hypothesis gained considerable attention after its introduction due to the interest in determining the origin of the eukaryotic cell. This hypothesis has primarily been in contrast with the [[three-domain system]] introduced by [[Carl Woese]] in 1977. Additional evidence supporting the eocyte hypothesis was published in the 1980s, but despite fairly unequivocal evidence, support waned in favor of the three-domain system.&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=James A. |last1=Lake |title=Origin of the eukaryotic nucleus determined by rate-invariant analysis of rRNA sequences |journal=Nature |volume=331 |pages=184–186 |year=1988 |doi=10.1038/331184a0 |issue=6152 |pmid=3340165|bibcode=1988Natur.331..184L }}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 October 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Archibald/&gt;

With advancements in [[genomics]], the eocyte hypothesis experienced a revival beginning in the mid-2000s. As more archaeal [[genomes]] were sequenced, numerous genes coding for eukaryotic traits have been discovered in various archaean phyla, seemingly providing support for the eocyte hypothesis. [[Proteomics]] based research has also found supporting data with the use of elongation factor 1-α ([[eEF-1]]), a common housekeeping protein, to compare structural homology between eukaryotic and archaean lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roger |first1=A |last2=Sandblom |first2=O |last3=Doolittle |first3=W.F. |last4=Philippe |first4=H |title=An evaluation of elongation factor 1 alpha as a phylogenetic marker for eukaryotes |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=218–233 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026104|pmid=10028289 |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, other proteins have been sequenced through proteomics with homologous structures in [[heat shock proteins]] found in both eukaryotes and archaea. The structure of these heat shock proteins were identified though [[X-ray crystallography]] to find the three dimensional structure of the proteins.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rivera |first1=Maria |last2=Lake |first2=James |title=Evidence That Eukaryotes and Eocyte Prokaryotes are Immediate Relatives |journal=Science |date=July 3, 1992 |volume=257 |issue=5066 |pages=74–76 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These proteins however have differing purposes as the eukaryote heat shock protein is a part of the T-complex while the archaeal heat shock protein is a molecular chaperone.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This creates an issue with the sequence homology that has been seen between [[Hsp70|70 kilodalton heat shock proteins]] in eukaryotes and gram negative bacteria.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gupta |first1=R.S. |last2=Singh |first2=B. |title=Phylogenetic analysis of 70 kD heat shock protein sequences suggests a chimeric origin for the eukaryotic nucleus |journal=Current Biology |volume=4 |issue=12 |pages=1104–1114 |doi=10.1016/s0960-9822(00)00249-9|year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to a Crenarchaeal origin of eukaryotes, some studies have suggested that eukaryotes may also have originated in the [[Thaumarchaeota]].&lt;ref name=Archibald/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=S. |last1=Kelly |first2=B. |last2=Wickstead |first3=K. |last3=Gull |title=Archaeal phylogenomics provides evidence in support of a methanogenic origin of the Archaea and a thaumarchaeal origin for the eukaryotes |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume=278 |issue=1708 |pages=1009–1018 |year=2011 |url=http://www.stevekelly.eu/pdf/Kelly_2010.pdf |accessdate=5 October 2012 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.1427 |pmid=20880885 |pmc=3049024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Anthony M. |last1=Poole |first2=Nadja |last2=Neumann |title=Reconciling an archaeal origin of eukaryotes with engulfment: a biologically plausible update of the Eocyte hypothesis |journal=Research in Microbiology |volume=162 |issue=1 |pages=71–76 |year=2011 |url=http://norlx51.nordita.org/~brandenb/astrobiology/docs/Poole+Neumann2011.pdf |accessdate=5 October 2012 |doi=10.1016/j.resmic.2010.10.002|pmid=21034814 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lionel |last1=Guy |first2=Thijs J.

It is seen that eukaryotes share a large number of proteins with members of the TACK superphylum and that these complex archaea may have had rudimentary [[phagocytosis]] abilities to engulf bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koonin |first1=Eugene |title=Origin of eukaryotes from within archaea, archaeal eukaryome and bursts of gene gain: eukaryogenesis just made easier? |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |date=26 September 2015 |volume=370 |issue=1678 |pages=20140333 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2014.0333 |pmid=26323764|pmc=4571572 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eocyte tree root may be located in the [[RNA World]], that is the root organism may have been a [[Ribocyte]] (aka Ribocell). For cellular DNA and DNA handling an "out of virus" scenario has been proposed, i. e. string genetic information in DNA may have been an invention performed by viruses later handed over to Ribocytes twice, once transforming them into bacteria and once transforming them into archaea.&lt;ref&gt;P.

Although archaeal viruses aren't as studied as bacterial phages, it is thought that dsDNA viruses lead to the incorporation of the viral genome into archaeal genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zilig |first1=W |title=Viruses, plasmids, and other genetic elements of thermophilic and hyperthermophilic Archaea |journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews |volume=18 |issue=2–3 |pages=225–236 |doi=10.1016/0168-6445(96)00014-9|year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transduction of genetic material through a viral vector lead to an increase in complexity in the pre-eukaryotic cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=P |first1=Forterre |title=The Common Ancestor of Archaea and Eukarya Was Not as Archaeon |journal=Archaea |volume=2013 |pages=1–18 |date=2013 |doi=10.1155/2013/372396|pmid=24348094 |pmc=3855935 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All these findings do not change the eocyte tree as given here in principle, but zoom into a higher resolution of it.

==Arguments Against==
Due to the similarities found between eukaryotes and both archaea and bacteria, it is thought that a major source of the genetic variation is through horizontal gene transfer.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leonard |first1=C.J. |last2=Aravind |first2=L |last3=Koonin |first3=E.V. |title=Novel Families of Putative Protein Kinases in Bacteria and Archaea: Evolution of the "Eukaryotic" Protein Kinase Superfamily |journal=Genome Research |volume=8 |issue=10 |pages=1038–1047 |doi=10.1101/gr.8.10.1038|year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[horizontal gene transfer]] is the reason for why archaeal sequences are found in bacteria and bacterial sequences are found in archaea.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; This could be the reasoning for why elongation factors found in archaea and eukaryotes are so similar, the data currently out is obscured as horizontal gene transfer, vertical gene transfer, or endosymbiosis could be behind the gene sequence similarity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The Eocyte Hypothesis also has troubles due to the endosymbiotic theory and how the archaea were able to phagocytize the bacteria for the formation of membrane bound organelles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davidov |first1=Y |last2=Jurkevitch |first2=E |title=Predation between prokaryotes and the origin of eukaryotes |journal=BioEssays |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=748–757 |doi=10.1002/bies.200900018|pmid=19492355 |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that these ancestral prokaryotes began to have ectosymbiotic relationships with other prokaryotes and slowly engulfed these symbiotes through cell membrane protrusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baum |first1=David |title=An inside-out origin for the eukaryotic cell |journal=BMC Biology |date=28 October 2014 |volume=12 |pages=776 |doi=10.1186/s12915-014-0076-2 |pmid=25350791 |pmc=4210606 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there has been data that attempts to confirm the relationship between eukaryotes and Chrenarcheota through the analysis of elongation factors, more recent experimentation with elongation factors provides data that disproves the eocyte hypothesis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hasegawa |first1=Masami |last2=Iwabe |first2=Naoyuko |last3=Mukohata |first3=Yasuo |last4=Miyata |first4=Takashi |title=Close evolutionary relatedness of archaebacteria, Methanococcus and Halobacterium, to eukaryotes demonstrated by composite phylogenetic trees of elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G: Eocyte tree is unlikely |journal=The Japanese Journal of Genetics |date=11 April 1990 |volume=65 |pages=109–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hasegawa et al. uses these elongation factors to help solidy that eukaryotes and archaebacteria are more closely related than archaebacteria and eubacteria that is explained in this 2 tree system.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

A competing hypothesis is that prokaryotes evolved towards thriving in higher temperatures to evade viruses through the thermoreductive hypothesis, however this does not account for eukaryotes arise and only takes into consideration the prokaryotic origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Forterre |first1=P |title=Thermoreduction, a hypothesis for the origin of prokaryotes |journal=PubMed |date=1995 |pages=415–422}}&lt;/ref&gt; However decrease in complexity from a more complex origin is the basis of reductive evolution where a commensal relationship occurs, while this reduction explained in the thermoreduction hypothesis uses a parasitic relationship with viruses to explain the movement of complex pre-eukaryotes to a more harsh environment; that being ocean floor hydrothermal vents.

A '''fallacy of division''' occurs when one reasons [[logic]]ally that something true for the whole must also be true of all or some of its parts.

An example:

# The 2nd grade in Jefferson elementary eats a lot of ice cream
# Carlos is a 2nd grader in Jefferson elementary
# Therefore, Carlos eats a lot of ice cream

The converse of this [[fallacy]] is called [[fallacy of composition]], which arises when one fallaciously attributes a property of some part of a thing to the thing as a whole.  Both fallacies were addressed by [[Aristotle]] in ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]''.

In the philosophy of the ancient Greek [[Anaxagoras]], as claimed by the Roman [[atomist]] [[Lucretius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Intellectual Property Protection of Fact-based Works: Copyright and Its Alternatives|page=110|first=Robert|last=Brauneis|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was assumed that the atoms constituting a substance must themselves have the salient observed properties of that substance: so atoms of water would be wet, atoms of iron would be hard, atoms of wool would be soft, etc. This doctrine is called ''[[homoeomeria (philosophy)|homoeomeria]]'', and it depends on the fallacy of division.

If a system as a whole has some property that none of its constituents has (or perhaps, it has it but not as a ''result'' of some constituent having that property), this is sometimes called an ''[[Emergence|emergent]]'' property of the system.

==Examples==

In [[statistics]] an [[ecological fallacy]] is a logical fallacy in the interpretation of statistical data where inferences about the nature of individuals are deduced from inference for the group to which those individuals belong. The four common statistical ecological fallacies are: confusion between ecological correlations and individual correlations, confusion between group average and total average,  [[Simpson's paradox]], and other statistical methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Logic: A Modern Introduction to Deductive Reasoning|pages=160–163|first=Dailey|last=Burnham Terrell|year=1967|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Five Strengths''' ([[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]]: ''{{IAST|pañcabalāni}}'') in Buddhism are [[Saddha|faith]], [[Viriya|energy]], [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]], [[Samadhi (Buddhism)|concentration]], and [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]].  They are one of the seven sets of "[[Bodhipakkhiyadhamma|qualities conducive to enlightenment]]." They are parallel facets of the five "[[Indriya|spiritual faculties]]."

==Translation==
''Pañca'' (Sanskrit, Pali) means "five."&lt;ref&gt;See Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 387, entry for "Pañca," retrieved 2008-03-11 from "U. of Chicago" at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:971.pali; and, Monier-Williams (1964), e.g., p. 579, entry "Pañcaka," retrieved 2008-03-11 from "U. of Cologne" at http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/MWScanpdf/mw0578-paJcAGguri.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bala'' (Sanskrit, Pali) means "power," "strength," "force."&lt;ref&gt;See Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 482, entry for "Bala," retrieved 2008-03-11 from "U. of Chicago" at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:3245.pali; and, Monier-Williams (1964), p. 722, entry "Bala," retrieved 2008-03-11 from "U. of Cologne" at http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0722-barAsI.jpg.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exegesis==
Faith and Wisdom balance each other, as do Energy and Concentration.
The Five Faculties are ‘controlling' faculties because they control or master their opposites.
The faculties and powers are two aspects of the same thing.

#Faith/Conviction ([[Faith in Buddhism|saddhā]] bala) - controls doubt
#Energy/Effort/Persistence ([[Vīrya|viriya]] bala) – controls laziness
#Mindfulness ([[Sati (Buddhism)|sati]] bala) - controls heedlessness
#Concentration ([[Samadhi|samādhi]] bala) - controls distraction
#Wisdom/Discernment ([[Prajñā (Buddhism)|paññā]] bala) – controls ignorance

A '''gift''' or a '''present''' is an item given to someone without the expectation of payment or anything in return. An item is not a gift if that item is already owned by the one to whom it is given. Although gift-giving might involve an expectation of reciprocity, a gift is meant to be free. In many countries, the act of mutually exchanging [[money]], [[property|goods]], etc. may sustain social relations and contribute to social cohesion. Economists have elaborated the [[economics]] of gift-giving into the notion of a [[gift economy]]. By extension the term ''gift'' can refer to any item or act of service that makes the other [[happiness|happier]] or less sad, especially as a favor, including [[forgiveness]] and [[kindness]]. Gifts are also first and foremost presented on occasions such as birthdays and holidays.

== Presentation ==
In many cultures gifts are traditionally packaged in some way. For example, in Western cultures, gifts are often wrapped in [[wrapping paper]] and accompanied by a [[gift note]] which may note the occasion, the recipient's name and the giver's name. In Chinese culture, red wrapping connotes luck. Although inexpensive gifts are common among colleagues, associates and acquaintances, expensive or amorous gifts are considered more appropriate among close friends, romantic interests or relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brigham|first1=John Carl|title=Social Psychology|date=1986|page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gift-giving occasions  ==
Gift-giving occasions may be:
* An expression of [[coronation]]  event recognition personal coronation gift presented by the newly crowned monarch to the official coronation guest by the court protocol for level
* An expression of [[coronation]] acknowledgement for national event Official coronation gift, Royal or Imperial commissioned by the coronation commission presented to the newly crowned monarch, as personal memento.    
* An expression of [[love]] or [[friendship]]
* An expression of [[gratitude]] for a gift received.
* An expression of [[piety]], in the form of [[alms|charity]].
* An expression of [[solidarity (sociology)|solidarity]], in the form of [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]].
* To share wealth.
* To offset misfortune.
* Offering travel [[souvenir]]s.
* Custom, on occasions (often [[celebration (party)|celebrations]]) such as
** A [[birthday]] (the person who has his or her birthday gives [[cake]], etc. and/or receives gifts).
** A [[potlatch]], in societies where status is associated with gift-giving rather than acquisition.
** [[Christmas]] (throughout the history of Christmas gift giving, people have given one another gifts, often pretending they are left by [[Santa Claus]], the [[Christ child]] or [[Saint Nicholas]]).
** [[Feast of Saint Nicholas]] (people give each other gifts, often supposedly receiving them from Saint Nicholas).
** Easter baskets with chocolate eggs, jelly beans, and chocolate rabbits are gifts given on [[Easter]].
** [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Christians]] in Greece, will give gifts to family and friends on the Feast of [[Saint Basil]].
** [[Muslims]] give gifts to family and friends, known as [[Eidi (gift)|Eidi]], on [[Eid al-Fitr]] (the end of [[Ramadan]]) and on [[Eid al-Adha]].

== Promotional Gifts ==
Promotional gifts vary from the normal gifts. The recipients of the gifts may be either employee of a company or the clients. Promotional gifts are mainly used for advertising purposes. They are used to promote the brand name and increase its awareness among the people. In promotional gifting procedures, the quality and presentation of the gifts hold more value than the gifts itself since it will act as a gateway to acquire new clients or associates.

== As reinforcement and manipulation ==
Giving a gift to someone is not necessarily just an altruistic act. It may be given in the hope that the receiver [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocates]] in a particular way. It may take the form of [[positive reinforcement]] as a [[Reward system|reward]] for [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]], possibly for an underhand [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] and [[abusive]] purpose.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unwanted gifts==

A significant fraction of gifts are unwanted, or the giver pays more for the item than the recipient values it, resulting in a misallocation of economic resources known as a [[deadweight loss]].  Unwanted gifts are often [[regifted]], donated to charity, or thrown away.&lt;ref name="vox"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/12/21/14032662/christmas-gift-giving-wasteful|title=The economic case against Christmas presents |work=Vox |access-date=December 5, 2017 |date=December 21, 2016 |last=Lee |first=Timothy B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A gift that actually imposes a burden on the recipient, either due to maintenance or storage or disposal costs, is known as a [[white elephant]].  

One means of reducing the mismatch between the buyer and receivers' tastes is advance coordination, often undertaken in the form of a [[wedding registry]] or [[Christmas list]]. Wedding registries in particular are often kept at a single store, which can designate the exact items to be purchased (resulting in matching housewares), and to coordinate purchases so the same gift is not purchased by different guests. One study found that wedding guests who departed from the registry typically did so because they wished to signal a closer relationship to the couple by personalizing a gift, and also found that as a result of not abiding by the recipients' preferences, their gifts were appreciated less often.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/06/24/483426485/new-study-explores-psychology-of-giving-wedding-gifts |title=New Study Explores Psychology Of Giving Wedding Gifts |last=Mendoza |first=Nohely |date=December 26, 2017 |location=Waco, Texas |newspaper= Nexstar Broadcasting }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated $3.4 billion was spent on unwanted Christmas gifts in the United States in 2017.&lt;ref name="cent"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.centexproud.com/news/local/biggest-return-day-of-the-year/888734842 |title=Biggest return day of the year |last=Mendoza |first=Nohely |location=Waco, Texas |access-date=September 19, 2018 |newspaper=Nexstar Broadcasting }}&lt;/ref&gt; The day after Christmas is typically the busiest day for returns in countries with large Christmas gift giving traditions.&lt;ref name="cent" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/unwanted-christmas-presents-returns-busiest-day-year-working-retail-a8138181.html |title=Unwanted Christmas presents set to rise on busiest day of the year for returns |newspaper=The Independent |date=January 2, 2018 |access-date=September 19, 2018 |last=Musaddique |first=Shafi }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total unredeemed value of [[gift cards]] purchased in the U.S. each year is estimated to be about a billion dollars.&lt;ref name="vox" /&gt;

== Legal aspects ==
{{Main|Gift (law)|Gift tax}}

At [[common law]], for a gift to have legal effect, it was required that there be (1) intent by the donor to give a gift, and (2) delivery to the recipient of the item to be given as a gift.

In some countries, certain types of gifts above a certain monetary amount are subject to taxation.  For the United States, see [[Gift tax in the United States]].

In some contexts, gift giving can be construed as [[bribery]].  This tends to occur in situations where the gift is given with an implicit or explicit agreement between the giver of the gift and its receiver that some type of service will be rendered (often outside of normal legitimate methods) because of the gift. Some groups, such as government workers, may have strict rules concerning gift giving and receiving so as to avoid the appearance of impropriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://oge.gov/web/oge.nsf/Gifts%20and%20Payments |title=Gifts and Payments |publisher=United States Office of Government Ethics |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=September 19, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious views ==
[[Lewis Hyde]] remarks in ''The Gift'' that [[Christianity]] considers the [[Incarnation]] and subsequent death of [[Jesus]] to be the greatest gift to humankind, and that the [[Jataka]] contains a tale of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] in his incarnation as the Wise Hare giving the ultimate [[alms]] by offering himself up as a meal for [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Sakka]]. (Hyde, 1983, 58-60)

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the bread and wine that are [[consecrated]] during the [[Divine Liturgy]] are referred to as "the Gifts." They are first of all the gifts of the community (both individually and corporately) to God, and then, after the [[epiklesis]], the Gifts of the [[Body of Christ|Body]] and [[Blood of Christ|Blood]] of [[Christ]] to the Church.

Ritual [[sacrifice]]s can be seen as return gifts to a [[deity]].

'''Heckler's veto''' is an [[Free speech in the United States|American free speech]] term describing situations in which a party who disagrees with a speaker's message is able to unilaterally trigger events that result in the speaker being silenced.

In the legal sense, a heckler's veto occurs when the speaker's right is curtailed or restricted by the government in order to prevent a ''reacting party's'' behavior. The common example is the termination of a speech or demonstration in the interest of maintaining the public peace based on the anticipated negative reaction of someone opposed to that speech or demonstration. The term was coined by  [[University of Chicago]] professor of law [[Harry Kalven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nazi/Skokie Conflict: A Civil Liberties Battle |first=David |last=Hamlin |location=Boston |publisher=Beacon Press |year=1980 |page=57 |isbn=0-8070-3230-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2017|reason=The current citation, Kalven's 1980 book, does not support this contention.

Colloquially, the term is used to describe situations where [[hecklers]] or demonstrators silence a speaker without intervention of the law.

== Law ==
[[Case law in the United States|In the United States]], [[case law]] regarding the heckler's veto is mixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGaffey|first=Ruth|date=1973|title=The Heckler's Veto|url=https://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/mulr/vol57/iss1/3|journal=Marquette Law Review|volume=57|pages=39-64|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most findings say that the acting party's actions cannot be pre-emptively stopped due to ''fear'' of heckling by the reacting party, but in the immediate face of violence, authorities can force the acting party to cease their action in order to satisfy the hecklers.

The best known case involving the heckler's veto is probably ''[[Feiner v. New York]]'', handed down by the Supreme Court in 1951.  Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson]], writing for the majority, held that police officers acted within their power in arresting a speaker if the arrest was "motivated solely by a proper concern for the preservation of order and protection of the general welfare".  340 U.S. 315.

In ''[[Gregory v. Chicago]]'' (1969), Justice [[Hugo Black]], in a concurring opinion, argued that arresting demonstrators as a consequence of unruly behavior of by-standers would amount to a heckler's veto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2280&amp;context=mulr&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3D%2522gregory%2520v.%2520chicago%2522%2520%2522heckler%27s%2520veto%2522%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D1%26ved%3D0CB4QFjAA%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fscholarship.law.marquette.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D2280%2526context%253Dmulr%26ei%3DhwobT6bCC4KwiQKyroWwCA%26usg%3DAFQjCNEmEqL_BCo_q6ztr-M8oQXxLcWTPg#search=%22gregory%20v.%20chicago%20hecklers%20veto%22|title= The Heckler's Veto: A Reexamination|author=|date=|website=marquette.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was rejected in ''[[Hill v. Colorado]]'' (2000),&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite court  |litigants = Hill v. Colorado  |vol = 530 U.S. 703, 735  |reporter =   |opinion =   |pinpoint =   |court = [[SCOTUS]]  |year = 2000  |url=http://supreme.vlex.com/vid/hill-v-colorado-20080806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] rejected the "Heckler's Veto," finding "governmental grants of power to private actors" to be "constitutionally problematic" in cases where "the regulations allowed a single, private actor to unilaterally silence a speaker".&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== Other uses of the phrase ==
Heckler's veto is often used outside a strict legal context. One example is an article by [[Nat Hentoff]] in which he claims that "First Amendment law is clear that everyone has the right to picket a speaker, and to go inside the hall and heckle him or her—but not to drown out the speaker, let alone rush the stage and stop the speech before it starts. That's called the 'heckler's veto'."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0645,hentoff,74928,2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hentoff's formulation, the heckler him or herself is the party which directly carries out the "veto" and suppresses speech. This runs counter to the legal meaning of the phrase. Note that, to a lawyer familiar with the First Amendment law, the phrase "heckler's veto" means something different from what the plain English interpretation of the words suggests. In First Amendment law, a heckler's veto is the suppression of speech by the government, because of [the possibility of] a violent reaction by hecklers. It is the government that vetoes the speech, because of the reaction of the heckler. Under the First Amendment, this kind of heckler's veto is unconstitutional.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs2.com/heckler.htm|title=Heckler's Veto|first=Dr. Ronald B.|last=Standler|date=|website=www.rbs2.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of California, Berkeley]] Law School Dean [[Erwin Chemerinsky]] has invoked the concept in an editorial following an incident on February 8, 2010, in which heckling by individual students disrupted a speech by the [[List of Israeli ambassadors to the United States|Israeli ambassador]] [[Michael Oren]]. Chemerinsky explained that broad freedom exists to invite speakers and hold demonstrations, but that once a speaker has begun an invited lecture, “You have the right—if you disagree with me—to go outside and perform your protest. But you don’t get the right to come in when I’m talking and shout me down. Otherwise people can always silence a speaker by heckler’s veto, and [[Tower of Babel|Babel]] results”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Israel: Interrupted in Irvine |first=David |last=Lumb |date=Feb 15, 2010 |publisher=[[New University (newspaper)|New University]] |url=http://www.newuniversity.org/2010/02/news/israel-interrupted-in-irvine/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer science]], '''higher-order abstract syntax''' (abbreviated '''HOAS''') is a technique for the representation of [[abstract syntax tree]]s for languages with variable [[name binding|binders]].

==Relation to first-order abstract syntax==

An abstract syntax tree is ''abstract'' because it is a [[mathematical object]] that has certain structure by its very nature. For instance, in ''[[first-order abstract syntax]]'' (''FOAS'') trees, as commonly used in [[compiler]]s, the tree structure implies the subexpression relation, meaning that no parentheses are required to disambiguate programs (as they are in the [[concrete syntax]]). HOAS exposes additional structure: the relationship between variables and their binding sites. In FOAS representations, a variable is typically represented with an identifier, with the relation between binding site and use being indicated by using the ''same'' identifier. With HOAS, there is no name for the variable; each use of the variable refers directly to the binding site.

There are a number of reasons why this technique is useful. First, it makes the binding structure of a program explicit: just as there is no need to explain operator precedence in a FOAS representation, there is no need to have the rules of binding and scope at hand to interpret a HOAS representation. Second, programs that are 
[[lambda calculus|alpha-equivalent]] (differing only in the names of bound variables) have identical representations in HOAS, which can make equivalence checking more efficient. &lt;!-- other uses? --&gt;

==Implementation==

One mathematical object that could be used to implement HOAS is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] where variables are associated with their binding sites via [[edge (graph theory)|edges]]. Another popular way to implement HOAS (in, for example, compilers) is with [[de Bruijn index|de Bruijn indices]].

==Use in logical frameworks==
In the domain of [[logical framework]]s, the term higher-order abstract syntax is usually used to refer to a specific representation that uses the binders of the [[metalanguage|meta-language]] to encode the binding structure of the [[object language]].

For instance, the logical framework [[LF (logical framework)|LF]] has a λ-construct, which has arrow
(→) type. A first-order encoding of an object language construct &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; would be (using [[Twelf]]
syntax):

 exp : type.
 var : type.
 v : var -&gt; exp.
 let : exp -&gt; var -&gt; exp -&gt; exp.

Here, &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; is the family of object language expressions. The family &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; is the representation of variables (implemented perhaps as natural numbers, which is not shown); the constant &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; witnesses the fact that variables are expressions. The constant &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; is an expression that takes three arguments: an expression (that is being bound), a variable (that it is bound to) and another expression (that the variable is bound within).

The [[canonical form|canonical]] HOAS representation of the same object language would be:

 exp : type.
 let : exp -&gt; (exp -&gt; exp) -&gt; exp.

In this representation, object level variables do not appear explicitly. The constant &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; takes an expression (that is being bound) and a meta-level function &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; 
(the body of the let). This function is the ''higher-order'' part: an expression with a free variable is
represented as an expression with ''holes'' that are filled in by the meta-level function when applied. As a concrete example, we would construct the object level expression

 let x = 1 + 2
 in x + 3

(assuming the natural constructors for numbers and addition) using the HOAS signature above as

 let (plus 1 2) ([y] plus y 3)

where &lt;code&gt;[y] e&lt;/code&gt; is Twelf's syntax for the function &lt;math&gt;\lambda y.e&lt;/math&gt;.

This specific representation has advantages beyond the ones above: for one, by reusing the meta-level notion of binding, the encoding enjoys properties such as type-preserving ''substitution'' without the need to define/prove them. In this way using HOAS can drastically reduce the amount of [[boilerplate code]] having to do with binding in an encoding.

Higher-order abstract syntax is generally only applicable when object language variables can be understood as variables in the mathematical sense (that is, as stand-ins for arbitrary members of some domain). This is often, but not always, the case: for instance, there are no advantages to be gained from a HOAS encoding of [[scope (programming)#Dynamic scoping|dynamic scope]] as it appears in some dialects of [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] because dynamically scoped variables do not act like mathematical variables.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3216">An '''honest broker''' is an entity that keeps sets of private information but distributes parts of those sets to other entities who should not have access to the entire set. Honest brokers often work in [[clinical research]] with [[biological specimens]]; in that case, donors of specimens allow researchers to do research on those specimens, but typically want their specimen [[de-identification|de-identified]] by having [[protected health information]] separated from it. The honest broker would keep both the specimen and associated protected health information, but only allow researchers to have access to the specimen without the protected health information.

==Characteristics ==
Honest brokers are typically appointed to a research project by an [[institutional review board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Auray-Blais | first1 = C. | last2 = Patenaude | first2 = J. | journal = BMC Medical Ethics | volume = 7 | pages = 4 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6939-7-4 | pmid =  16600040|title=A biobank management model applicable to biomedical research| pmc = 1475589}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide data from clinical and research sources for research use only and in accordance with policies that prohibit re-identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dhir | first1 = R. | last2 = Patel | first2 = A.

Organizations conducting [[breast cancer]] research have identified access to biological specimens as a top priority, and therefore honest broker systems are key to research because they increase access to specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Taube | first1 = S.

==Diplomacy==
In Diplomacy, an "honest broker" is an entity (individual or organisation) that is accepted by all sides in a negotiation as impartial. Neutrality does not equal an absence of interest; rather, the interest of the honest broker lies in a solution, without preference for either party involved in the conflict.

German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] was the first to use the term (applied to himself) in connection with the 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]].&lt;ref name="washingtoninstitute.org"&gt;The Washington Institute for Near East Policy: [http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-united-states-as-an-honest-broker The United States as an Honest Broker - The Washington Institute for Near East Policy], accessdate: May 30, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Implicit cognition''' refers to unconscious influences such as [[knowledge]], [[perception]], or [[memory]], that influence a person's [[behavior]], even though they themselves have no conscious awareness whatsoever of those influences.&lt;ref name="ReingoldRay2006"/&gt;

==Overview==
Implicit cognition is everything one does and learns unconsciously or without any awareness that one is doing it. An example of implicit cognition could be when a person first learns to ride a bike: at first they are aware that they are learning the required skills. After having stopped for many years, when the person starts to ride the bike again they do not have to relearn the motor skills required, as their implicit knowledge of the motor skills&lt;ref name=Baddeley1997/&gt; takes over and they can just start riding the bike as if they had never stopped. In other words, they do not have to think about the actions that they are performing in order to ride the bike. It can be seen with this example that implicit cognition is involved with many of the different mental activities and everyday situations of people's daily lives.&lt;ref name=GrafMasson1993/&gt; There are many processes in which implicit memory works, which include learning, our social cognition, and our problem solving skills.

==History==
Implicit cognition was first discovered in the year of 1649 by [[Descartes]] in his ''[[Passions of the Soul]]''. He said in one of his writings that he saw that unpleasant childhood experiences remain imprinted in a child's brain until its death without any conscious memory of it remaining.&lt;ref name=Schacter1987/&gt; Even though this idea was never accepted by any of his peers, in 1704 [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in his ''[[New Essays Concerning Human Understanding]]'' stressed the importance of unconscious perceptions which he said were the ideas that we are not consciously aware of yet still influence people's behavior.&lt;ref name=Schacter1987/&gt; He claimed that people have residual effects of prior impressions without any remembrance of them. In 1802&lt;!--Schachter 1987 incorrectly gives 1804, but the book was published in 1802--&gt; French philosopher [[Maine de Biran]] in his ''The Influence of Habit on the Faculty of Thinking'' was the first person after Leibniz to systematically discuss implicit memory stating that after enough repetition, a habit can become automatic or completed without any conscious awareness.&lt;ref name=Schacter1987/&gt; In 1870 [[Ewald Hering]] said that it was essential to consider unconscious memory, which is involved in involuntary recall, and the development of automatic and unconscious habitual actions.&lt;ref name=Schacter1987/&gt;

==Implicit learning==
Implicit learning starts in our early childhood, this means that people are not able to learn the proper grammar and rules to speaking a language until the age of seven. So if this is the case then how do we learn to talk by the age of four? One of the ways that this is possible is through implicit learning and association. Children learn their first language from what they hear when they are listening to the adults and through their own talking activities.&lt;ref name=Howes2007/&gt; This goes to show that the way children learn language involves implicit learning.

===Studies on implicit learning===
A study was conducted with amnesiac patients in an attempt to demonstrate that amnesiac patients that were unable to learn a list of words or pictures when their performance was tested were able to complete or put together fragmented words and incomplete pictures. This was found to be true as the patients were able to perform better when asked to complete words or pictures. A possible explanation for this could be that implicit memory should be less susceptible to damage that may happen to the brain than explicit memory.&lt;ref name=Howes2007/&gt; There was a case where a 54-year-old man that had bitemporal damage worse on the right side had a hard time remembering things from his own life as well as famous events, names and even; yet he was able to perform within the normal limits with a word completion task involving famous names and with judgments of famous faces.&lt;ref name=Baddeley2002/&gt; This is a prime example that implicit memory can be less vulnerable to brain damage.

A famous study investigated the Identification blindsight effect with individuals who had suffered damage to one half of the visual cortex and were blind in the opposite half of the visual field.&lt;ref name=GrafMasson1993/&gt; It was discovered that when objects or pictures were shown to these blind areas, the participants said that they saw no object or picture, but a certain number were able to identify the stimulus as either a cross or circle when asked to guess at a considerably higher rate than would have been expected by chance.&lt;ref name=Howes2007/&gt; The reason that this happened is because the information was able to be process through the first three stages of selection, organization, and interpretation or comprehension of the perceptual cycle but failed at only the last stage of retention and memory where the identified image is entered into their awareness. Thus stimuli can enter implicit memory even when people are unable to consciously perceive them.

==Implicit social relations==
Implicit cognition also plays a role in social cognition. People tend to see objects and individuals as more encouraging or acceptable the more often&lt;ref name=GrafMasson1993/&gt; that people are exposed to them. An example includes the False-fame Effect.&lt;ref name=GrafMasson1993/&gt; Graf and Masson (1993) conducted a study where they showed participants a list with both famous and non-famous names. When it was shown around people were able to recall the famous names more than the non-famous names initially, but after about a 24-hour delay participants began to associate the non-famous names with famous people. This supports implicit cognition because the participants began to unconsciously associate the non-famous names with famous people.

Although the process is unconscious, implicit cognition influences how people view each other as well as their interactions with one another. People tend to view those who look alike as belonging together or to similar groups&lt;ref name=WegnerVallacher1977/&gt; and associate them with the social groups that existed in their high school years. These groups represented different relations between the students and were made up of students who were perceived as having similarities among each other. 
A study was conducted to see the amount of distance that participants put between individuals given certain circumstances. The participants were asked to place figures of individuals where they thought the figures should be standing given certain circumstances. It was found that people typically place men and women close to each other, to make little families formed with the figures of a woman, a man and of children.&lt;ref name=WegnerVallacher1977/&gt; The participants did the same when asked to show friends and/or acquaintances, the two figures were placed relatively close to one another rather than if they were asked to represent strangers. When asked to represent strangers the participants placed the figures far apart. There are two parts to the social relations view that is liking relations were the ultimate goal is to be together, then there is the disliking relation view which is separation from the person.&lt;ref name=WegnerVallacher1977/&gt; An example of this could be when someone is walking down a hall way and see someone whom they know and like that person is more likely to wave and say hello to them. On the other hand, say the person they see is someone whom they dislike, their response will be the opposite as they try to either avoid them or get away from them as quickly as possible showing the separation between the two of them. There are two views to the social relations theory, one of them is that people are out to mainly seek dominance of those around them, while the other view is that people mainly see the relations as either belonging or not belonging or liking and disliking on another. It is seen that males mainly seek dominance against one another as they are competitive and looking to outdo one another. For females on the other hand it is seen that women perceive their social views and values as more of the belonging or liking scale in terms of their closeness to one another. Implicit cognition not only involved how people view each other but also how they view themselves. This means that our own image is constructed from what others see of us&lt;ref name=WegnerVallacher1977/&gt; rather than our own views. The way that we view ourselves is from what others see us as, or from the times that we compare ourselves to other people.  The way that this plays a role in implicit cognition is because all of these actions people do unconsciously, or they are unaware that they are making these decision. Men do not consciously seek to be dominant over one another as women do not consciously arrange their social views or values in terms of their closeness. These are each things that people do without their conscious knowledge of these actions, which ties in with implicit cognition.

==Implicit behaviors==
{{tone|section|date=May 2016}}
There are scenarios when we act on something and then think back about handling it in different situation or manner. That is implicit cognition coming into play, the mind will then go based off ethical and similar situations when interacting with a certain thought. Implicit cognition and its automated thought process allows a person to decide something out of impulse. It is often defined as an involuntary process where tasks are easily absent of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Graf, P, &amp; Schacter, D, L., (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; There are plenty of factors that influence behaviors and thought processes. Such as social learning, to stigmas, and two major aspects of implicit and explicit cognition. Implicit on one hand is obtained through social aspects and association, while explicit cognition is gained through propositional attitudes or beliefs of certain thoughts,&lt;ref&gt;Gawronski, B, &amp; Bodenhausen, G, V., (2006); Wilson, T. D., Lindsey, S., &amp; Schooler, T. Y. (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Implicit cognition can be incorporated with a mixture of attention, goals, self-association, and at times even motivational processes. Researchers have used different methods to test these theories of behavior correlation with implicit cognition. Using Implicit Association Tests (ITA's) is a method that is significantly used, according to Fazio &amp; Olsen (2003) and Richetin &amp; Richardson (2008). Since published, approximately ten years or so, it has been widely used influencing research on implicit attitudes. Implicit cognition is a process based off automatic mental interpretations. It's what a person really thinks, yet is not consciously aware of. Behavior is then affected, usually causing negative influences, both theoretically and empirical reasons presume that automatic cognitive processes are contributed to aggressive behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, C, A., et al. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Impulse behaviors are often created without awareness. Negativity is a characteristic of implicit cognition, since it is an automated response. Explicit cognition is rarely used when trying to discover behavior of ones thought process. Researchers again use IAT's to determine ones thoughts and how a person incorporates these automatic processes, findings consider that implicit cognition may direct what behaviors a person may choose when facing extreme stimuli. For example, death can be perceived as positive, negative, or a combination of the two.  Depending on the attributes of death, it can include a general perspective or a "me" attribute. {{harvtxt|Nock et al.|2010}} implied that implicit association with death and or suicide initiates a final process when deciding how to cope to these extreme measures. Self- harm is another characteristic associated with implicit cognition. Because although we may think of it, it is controlled subconsciously. IAT's showed that there was a stronger correlation of implicit cognition and death/suicide than self-harm. The idea of pain may influence a person to think twice, while suicidal may seem quick, thus the automatic process can show how effective this negative behavior and implicit cognition come hand in hand. Automated processes doesn't allow a person to thoroughly create a conscious choice, therefore creating negative influence to behavior. Another negative behavior that can be associated with implicit cognition is depression. Whether a person takes a positive or negative outlook on the certain situation can produce if a person will be associated with depression. It is easier to determine an implicit mindset simple because it is outside of awareness. Implicit processes are considered critical when determining a person's reactions to a certain schema. Implicit cognition is often immediately affective towards a person's reaction.{{sfn|Haeffel et al.|2007}} Implicit cognitions also consisted of negative schemas that included hidden cognitive frameworks, and activation of stress. Awareness was often misinterpreted and implicit cognition emerged because of these negative schemas.&lt;ref&gt;(Scher, C, D., Ingram, R, E., &amp; Sega S, V., 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviors merged through implicit cognition involve a variety of addictive behaviors, problematic thinking, depression, aggression, suicide, death, and other negative factors. Certain life situations add to this schema, whether it be stressful situations, sudden, or anything along these lines, aspects of implicit cognition are used and evaluated.

Implicit cognition can also be associated with mental illness and the way thoughts are processed. Automatic stigmas and attitudes may anticipate other cognitive and behavior tendencies. A person with mental illness may be correlated with a guilt-related, self-associated personality.&lt;ref&gt;Dovidio, J, F., et al., (2002) &amp; Greenwald, A, G., et al., (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these associations it may be managed outside one's own control and awareness, showing how implicit cognition is affected. However a dual process can be assessed within implicit and explicit cognition. An agreement between the two thought processes may be an issue, explicit may not be in contact with implicit, therefore causing more of a problem. Mental illness can include both implicit and explicit attitudes, however implicit self-concepts gave more negative consequence when dealing with mental illness. Much of implicit problems happened to be associated with alcohol, however this isn't the goal in order to describe a mental process and implicit cognition. The most widely influenced mental illness in association with implicit cognition would be Schizophrenia. Since a person of this illness has a problem of detecting what is real and what is not, implicit memory is often used with these patients. However, since it cannot really be detected if it is emotionally, mentally, or a combination of both some aspects of this illness are usually exercised uninterrupted, and unconsciously.{{sfn|Mano|Brown|2013}} Since schizophrenia is widely varied and has different characteristics, we cannot quite measure the outcome of implicit cognition.

==Definition==
Implicit cognition refers to perceptual, memory, comprehension, and performance processes that occur through unconscious awareness.{{sfn|Sun|2001}} For example, when a patient is discharged after a surgery, the effects of the anesthesia can cause abnormal behaviors without any conscious awareness. According to Wiers et al. (2006) some scholars argue implicit cognition is misinterpreted and could be used to improve behaviors while others highlight the dangers of it. Research studies have shown implicit cognition is a strong predictor for several issues like substance abuse, misconduct, and mental disorders.{{sfn|Wiers|Stacy|2006b}} These inherent thoughts are influenced from early adolescent experiences primarily a negative impact from culture. Adolescents who experience a rough childhood early on develop low levels of self-esteem. Therefore, the cognition to act dangerously is an oblivious development. Research for implicit cognition has started to grow especially within mental disorders.

==In mental disorders==
Schemas are used to interpret the functions involved when individuals would make sense of their surroundings. This cognition happens through an explicit process of recalling an item routinely or implicit process that is outside conscious awareness control. A recent study suggests individuals who have experienced a difficult upbringing develop schemata of fear as well as anxiety and will react almost immediately when they feel threatened. People who are anxious predominantly focus on any peril-related stimuli since they are hyper vigilant. For example, an anxious individual who is about to cross the street at the same time a car drives to a stop sign. The anxious person will automatically assume the driver will not stop. This is recognition of threat through a semantic process that instantaneously occurs. Ambiguous cues are viewed as a threat since there is no relevant knowledge to make sense of. People will have a difficult time to understand and will respond negatively.  This kind of behavior can explain how implicit cognition may be an influence for pathological anxiety.

The ideas of psychotic patients who have low self-esteem are prone to more serious illnesses. This concept was examined through both implicit and explicit perspectives by measuring the self-esteem of paranoia and depression patients. Previous research suggests that negative implicit cognition is not the symptoms for depression and paranoia, but it is an antecedent for the onset. Current research proposes that high implicit self-esteem is linked to less paranoia.{{sfn|Valiente et al.|2011}} It is imperative for patients who have low self-esteem to become more overt about these situations. Another study found a substantial association between adverse self-questioning in implicit cognition and depression.  People who do not think highly of themselves are more likely to be depressed because of this involuntary implicit learning.

Implicit cognition is another influential predictor for bipolar disorder and unipolar disorder. Research proposes patients with bipolar disorder show more common implicit and depressive self-referencing than unipolar patients. Implicit cognition plays a strong role for patients with both bipolar and unipolar disorder. These patients have dysfunctional self-schemata, which is viewed as vulnerability for potential illnesses. Patients who have this vulnerability usually do not seek mental assistance which can later become more problematic to treat. Bipolar disorder patients with low implicit self-esteem are more defensive. This is an unconscious reaction to be manic protective when they feel threatened in any way.
Since the growing research of implicit cognition is associated with abnormalities, researchers attempted to find a connection between implicit neuroticism and schizophrenia. Indeed, there was a correlation; participants with schizophrenia were high in implicit neuroticism and low in implicit extraversion when compared to people who were mentally healthy. Participants were given questionnaires that ask personality questions such as "I enjoy being the center of attention". Implicit cognition constitutes low levels of extraversion because these participants are known to avoid any coping. Schizophrenia patients and healthy individuals differ in associative representation pertaining to themselves in neuroticism features.  People who are schizophrenic develop an implicit learning, meaning they have an error free learning style so they never take feedback from anyone else.

Research on suicide can be a difficult process because suicidal patients are commonly covert about their intentions to avoid hospitalization. An implicit cognition associated self-task was applied in one experiment to unveil any suspicious behavior of people who might attempt suicide. This study found patients who were released from mental hospitals showed significant implicit association to attempt suicide. The Implicit Association Task would predict whether a patient was likely to attempt suicide depending on they respond. An individual's implicit cognition may lead to a behavior to best cope with stress. This behavior may be suicide, substance abuse, or even violence. However, implicit association with death will show those most at risk for attempting suicide because this individual is looking for the best solution for ending their stress.

==Task performed==
Implicit cognition is measured in different ways to find the most accurate outcomes. The task used for patients with anxiety disorders was a modified Stroop task to observe attention biases in anxiety. A participant's reaction time was measured by the reported color of each word. Participants would name the color for each risk relevant words and risk irrelevant words and depending on the color of each word might slow the reaction time. Colors like red were used to see if anxious participants would have a slower reaction time. These colors are known as aposematic implying a threat warning. Most studies used the Implicit Association Test which varies for each study. For example, implicit self-esteem can be tested by giving participants questionnaires that are self-referent.  These ask questions like "I am known to be suicidal".  Depending on the response of the participants, the researcher can assessed the current state for each participant. Patients that were rated high in suicide immediately received psychiatric treatment. According to these experiments implicit cognition may be a strong predictor for mental disorders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4418">The [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] in [[scalar-tensor theory]] can be expressed in the '''Jordan frame''' in which the scalar field or some function of it multiplies the [[Ricci scalar]],  or in the '''Einstein frame''' in which Ricci scalar is not multiplied by the scalar field.  There exist various transformations between these frames.  Despite the fact that these frames have been around for some time there is currently  heated debate about whether either,  both,  or neither frame is a 'physical' frame which can be compared to observations and experiment.

==Equations and physical interpretation==
If we perform the [[Weyl rescaling]] &lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}=\Phi^{-2/(d-2)} g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;, then the Riemann and Ricci tensors are modified as follows.
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-\tilde{g}}=\Phi^{-d/(d-2)}\sqrt{-g}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{R}=\Phi^{2/(d-2)}\left[ R + \frac{2(d-1)}{d-2}\frac{\Box \Phi}{\Phi} -\frac{3(d-1)}{(d-2)}\left(\frac{\nabla\Phi}{\Phi}\right)^2 \right]&lt;/math&gt;
As an example consider the transformation of a simple [[Scalar–tensor theory|Scalar-tensor]] action with an arbitrary set of matter fields &lt;math&gt;\psi_\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt; coupled minimally to the curved background
:&lt;math&gt;S = \int d^dx \sqrt{-\tilde{g}} \Phi \tilde{R} + S_\mathrm{m}[\tilde{g}_{\mu \nu},\psi_\mathrm{m}] =\int d^dx \sqrt{-g} \left[ R + \frac{2(d-1)}{d-2}\frac{\Box \Phi}{\Phi} - \frac{3(d-1)}{(d-2)}\left( \nabla\left(\ln \Phi \right) \right)^2\right] + S_\mathrm{m}[\Phi^{-2/(d-2)} g_{\mu\nu},\psi_\mathrm{m}]&lt;/math&gt;
The tilde fields then correspond to quantities in the Jordan frame and the fields without the tilde correspond to fields in the Einstein frame. See that the matter action &lt;math&gt;S_\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt; changes only in the rescaling of the metric.

The Jordan and Einstein frames are constructed to render certain parts of physical equations simpler which also gives the frames and the fields appearing in them particular physical interpretations. For instance, in the Einstein frame, the equations for the gravitational field will be of the form
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu \nu}= \mathrm{other \; fields}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
I.e., they can be interpreted as the usual [[Einstein equations]] with particular sources on the right-hand side. Similarly, in the [[Newtonian limit]] one would recover the Poisson equation for the Newtonian potential with separate source terms.

However, by transforming in the Einstein frame the matter fields are now not coupled simply to the background but also to the field &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; which now acts as an effective potential. Specifically, an isolated test particle will experience a universal four-acceleration
:&lt;math&gt;a^\mu= \frac{-1}{d-2} \frac{\Phi_{,\nu}}{\Phi}(g^{\mu \nu} + u^\mu u^\nu),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;u^\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the particle four-velocity. I.e., no particle will be in free-fall in the Einstein frame.

On the other hand, in the Jordan frame, all the matter fields &lt;math&gt;\psi_\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt; are coupled minimally to &lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}_{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt; and isolated test particles will move on geodesics with respect to the metric &lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}_{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt;. This means that if we were to reconstruct the Riemann curvature tensor by measurements of geodesic deviation, we would in fact obtain the curvature tensor in the Jordan frame. When, on the other hand, we deduce on the presence of matter sources from gravitational lensing from the usual relativistic theory, we obtain the distribution of the matter sources in the sense of the Einstein frame.

==Models==
Jordan frame gravity can be used to calculate type IV singular bouncing cosmological evolution, to derive the type IV singularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1504.06866|title=Bouncing cosmology with future singularity from modified gravity|journal=Physical Review D|volume=92|issue=2|pages=024016|date=27 June 2015|author=S.D.

'''Legality''' can be defined as an act, agreement, or contract that is consistent with the law or state of being lawful or unlawful in a given jurisdiction.

According to merriam-webster dictionary definition of Legality is 1 : attachment to or observance of law. 2 : the quality or state of being legal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legality|title=Definition of LEGALITY|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Businessdictionary.com, thelawdictionary.org, and mylawdictionary.org definition explains concept of ''attachment to law'' as ''Implied warranty that an act, agreement, or contract strictly adheres to the statutes of a particular jurisdiction. For example, in insurance contracts it is assumed that all risks covered under the policy are legal ventures.'' The second definition cited by Businessdictionary.com '' Legal principle that an accused may not be prosecuted for an act that is not declared a crime in that jurisdiction.'' is actually about Principle of legality which is part of over all concept of legality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/legality.html|title=What is legality? definition and meaning|work=businessdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelawdictionary.org/legality/|title=What is LEGALITY? definition of LEGALITY (Black's Law Dictionary)|work=thelawdictionary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How we interpret the reality of our actual understanding of a concept manifests itself through the different individual narratives that we tell about the origins and meanings of a particular concept. The difference in narratives, about the same set of facts, is what divides us. An individual has the ability to frame, or understand, something very differently than the next person. Evidence does not always lead to a clear attribution of the specific cause or meaning of an issue – meanings are derived through narratives. Reality, and the facts that surround it, are personally subjective and laden with assumptions based on clearly stated facts. Anna-Maria Marshall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Injustice Frames, Legality, and the Everyday Construction of Sexual Harassment|journal=Law &amp; Social Inquiry|first=Anna-Maria|last=Marshall|date=1 July 2003|publisher=|volume=28|issue=3|pages=659–689|doi=10.1111/j.1747-4469.2003.tb00211.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; states, this shift in framing happens because our perceptions depend “on new information and experiences;” this very idea is the basis of Ewick and Sibley definition of legality – our everyday experiences shape our understanding of the law.

Ewik and [[Joel H. Silbey|Silbey]] define Legality more broadly as, ''those meanings, sources of authority, and cultural practices that are in some sense legal although not necessarily approved or acknowledged by official law. The concept of legality the opportunity to consider "how where and with what effect law is produced in and through commonplace social interactions....How do our roles and statuses our relationships, our obligations, prerogatives and responsibilities, our identities and our behavoiurs bear the imprint of law.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K0Vgm5KYYjsC|title=Global Legal Pluralism: A Jurisprudence of Law Beyond Borders|first=Paul Schiff|last=Berman|date=27 February 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0-521-76982-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper on Normative Phenomena of Morality, Ethics and Legality',  Legality is defined taking states role in to account  as, ''The system of laws and regulations of right and wrong behavior that are enforceable by the state (federal, state, or local governmental body in the U.S.) through the exercise of its policing powers and judicial process, with the threat and use of penalties,
including its monopoly on the right to use physical violence. ''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2139/ssrn.920625|title=Integrity: A Positive Model that Incorporates the Normative Phenomena of Morality, Ethics and Legality|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|year=2009|last1=Erhard|first1=Werner|last2=Jensen|first2=Michael C.|last3=Zaffron|first3=Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle of legality ==
The ''principle of legality'' is the legal ideal that requires all [[law]] to be clear, ascertainable and non-retrospective. It requires decision makers to resolve disputes by applying legal rules that have been declared beforehand, and not to alter the legal situation retrospectively by discretionary departures from established law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|
title=Fair Notice and Fair Adjudication: two kinds of legality|first=Paul H.|last= Robinson
|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship/601}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to [[legal formalism]] and the [[rule of law]] and can be traced from the writings of [[Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach|Feuerbach]], [[A. V. Dicey|Dicey]] and [[Montesquieu]].

The principle has particular relevance in [[criminal law|criminal]] and [[administrative law]]. In criminal law it can be seen in the general prohibition on the imposition of criminal sanctions for acts or omissions that were not criminal at the time of their commission or omission. The principle is also thought to be violated when the sanctions for a particular crime are increased with retrospective effect.

In administrative law it can be seen in the desire for state officials to be bound by and apply the law rather than acting upon whim. As such advocates of the principle are normally against discretionary powers.

The principle can be varyingly expressed in Latin phrases such as ''[[Nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali]]'' (No crime can be committed, nor punishment imposed without a pre-existing penal law), ''[[nulla poena sine lege]]'' (no penalty without law) and ''nullum crimen sine lege'' (no crime without law). A law that violates the principle by retroactively making actions illegal that were committed before the enactment of the law is called an ''[[ex post facto law]]''.

== Other related concepts ==
[[Rule of law]] provides for availability of rules, laws and legal mechanism to implement them. Principle of legality checks for availability and quality of the laws. Legality checks for if certain behaviour is according to law or not. concept of Legitimacy of law looks for fairness or acceptability of fairness of process of implementation of law.

quality of being legal and observance to the law may pertain to lawfullness, i.e. being consistent to the law or it may get discussed in principle of legality or may be discussed as legal legitimacy.

===Legality of purpose===
In contract law, legality of purpose is required of every enforceable contract. One can not validate or enforce a contract to do activity with unlawful purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/example/%5Bfield_short_title-raw%5D_26|title=Legality of purpose – contracts|first=Michael|last=Litvin|date=15 September 2009|work=cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constitutional legality ===
The principle of legality can be affected in different ways by different constitutional models. In the [[United States]], laws may not violate the stated provisions of the [[United States Constitution]] which includes a prohibition on retrospective laws. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] under the doctrine of [[Parliamentary sovereignty]], the legislature can (in theory) pass such retrospective laws as it sees fit, though article 7 of the European convention on human rights, which has legal force in Britain, forbids conviction for a crime which was not illegal at the time it was committed. Article 7 has already had an effect in a number of cases in the British courts.

In contrast many written constitutions prohibit the creation of  [[Ex post facto law|retroactive]] (normally criminal) laws{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}. However the possibility of statutes being struck down creates its own problems. It is clearly more difficult to ascertain what is a valid statute when any number of statutes may have constitutional question marks hanging over them. When a statute is declared unconstitutional, the actions of public authorities and private individuals which were legal under the invalidated statute, are retrospectively tainted with illegality. Such a result could not occur under parliamentary sovereignty (or at least not before [[Factortame]]) as a statute was law and its validity could not be questioned in any court.

==International law==
Legality, in its criminal aspect, is a principle of [[international human rights law]], and is incorporated into the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. However the imposition of penalties for offences illegal under [[international law]] or criminal according to "the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations" are normally excluded from its ambit. As such the trial and punishment for [[genocide]], [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] does not breach international law.

There is some debate about whether this is really a true exception or not. Some people would argue that it is a derogation or – perhaps somewhat more harshly – an infringement of the principle of legality. While others would argue that crimes such as genocide are contrary to [[natural law]] and as such are always illegal and always have been. Thus imposing punishment for them is always legitimate. The exception and the natural law justification for it can be seen as an attempt to justify the [[Nuremberg trials]] and the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]], both of which were criticized for applying retrospective criminal sanctions.

The [[territorial principle]], generally confining national jurisdiction to a nation’s borders, has been expanded to accommodate extraterritorial, [[national interest]].

In criminal law, the principle of legality assures the primacy of law in all criminal proceedings.

Suárez began his career as a youth player for [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]] in 2003. At age 19, he relocated to the Netherlands to play for [[FC Groningen|Groningen]], before transferring to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in 2007. He won his first trophy in 2010, the [[2009–10 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]], finishing the season as [[Eredivisie#Top scorers|the league's top scorer]] and was named [[Dutch Footballer of the Year]].

In January 2011, Suárez transferred to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], and won the [[2011–12 Football League Cup|League Cup]] in his first full season. In 2014, he was named the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] and the [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] as well as winning the Premier League Golden Boot, and sharing the European Golden Shoe with Cristiano Ronaldo before moving to Barcelona in a transfer worth €82.3&amp;nbsp;million (£64.98&amp;nbsp;million), making him [[List of most expensive association football transfers|one of the most expensive players]] in football history.&lt;ref name="Revealed: How much Luis Suarez really cost Barcelona"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/11/liverpool-luis-suarez-barcelona-transfer-medical|title=Liverpool confirm Luis Suárez's £75m move to Barcelona pending medical|date=11 July 2014|work=The Guardian|accessdate=24 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711161731/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/11/liverpool-luis-suarez-barcelona-transfer-medical|archivedate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The panel also wanted to send a "strong message that such deplorable behaviours do not have a place in football", while noting that "all players in the higher level of the game are seen as role models, have the duty to act professionally and responsibly, and set the highest example of good conduct to the rest of the game – especially to young players".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Luis Suarez: Panel criticises Liverpool striker's reaction |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22311782 |work=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Uruguay's final group match against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 24 June, Uruguay needed a win to advance to the [[2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|knockout stage]] while Italy only needed a draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Italy – Uruguay Preview: Guaranteed exit for a former world champion|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/match/italy-vs-uruguay/1220093/preview|website=Goal.com|first=Luis |last=Herrera|accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the 79th minute and with the score at 0–0, Suárez clashed with Italian defender [[Giorgio Chiellini]] while waiting for a cross.

Two days later, on 26 June, the [[FIFA Disciplinary Code|FIFA Disciplinary Committee]], banned Suárez for nine international matches, effective immediately, meaning he would take no further part in the World Cup. The ban ruled him out of [[2015 Copa América]] as well. It was the longest such ban in World Cup history, exceeding the eight-match ban handed to Italy's [[Mauro Tassotti]] for breaking the nose of Spain's Luis Enrique at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]].&lt;ref name="Ban2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Luis Suarez suspended"&gt;{{cite news|title=Luis Suárez banned for four months for biting in World Cup game|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/26/world-cup-luis-suarez-ban-biting-uruguay|accessdate=26 June 2014|publisher=The Guardian|date=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/2014-world-cup-fifa-bans-suarez-games-months/story?id=24314667|title=FIFA Suspends and Fines Suarez for 9 Games and 4 Months After Biting Player|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also banned from taking part in any football-related activity (including entering any stadium) for four months and fined [[Swiss franc|CHF]]100,000.&lt;ref name="FIFABan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ban2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Luis Suarez suspended"/&gt; The seven-member FIFA panel studied the incident from 34 camera angles and rejected Suárez's defence that the bite was as a result of an accidental collision, instead finding the bite was "deliberate, intentional and without provocation... with the intention of wounding [Chiellini] or at least of destabilising him".

==Personal life==
Suárez was born in [[Salto, Uruguay]], the fourth of seven boys.&lt;ref name="Lyttleton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce 1-1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/lfc-player-profiles/luis-suarez/2011/02/09/luis-suarez-s-rise-from-the-streets-of-montevideo-to-liverpool-fc-hero-part-one-100252-28138725/ |title=Luis Suarez's rise from the streets of Montevideo to Liverpool FC hero – part one |first=James |last=Pearce |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=9 February 2011 |accessdate=20 August 2011 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His older brother, [[Paolo Suárez]], is also a professional footballer, currently playing for [[A.D. Isidro Metapán|Isidro Metapán]] in El Salvador.

Suárez moved with his family to [[Montevideo, Uruguay|Montevideo]] when he was seven, and his parents separated when he was nine.&lt;ref name="Pearce 1-1"/&gt; In Montevideo, he developed his football skills on the streets,&lt;ref name="personal bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce 1-1"/&gt; while also taking up work as a street sweeper.&lt;ref name="ESPNportrait"/&gt; The contrast between his life in Europe and the poverty he left behind has been cited as contributing to his periodic aggression on the field, as well as being a possible explanation for the more forgiving attitudes of the Uruguayan public and press towards such cases, compared to Europe.&lt;ref name="ESPNportrait"/&gt;

[[File:Mural escuela 171 01.jpg|thumb|left|Mural of Suárez on his former school in Montevideo, Uruguay]]

'''Markov's principle''', named after [[Andrey Markov (Soviet mathematician)|Andrey Markov Jr]], is a specific statement in [[computability theory]] that is obviously true classically (i.e. it is a [[Validity (logic)|logical validity]]), but must be proved when using [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructive]] mathematics. 
There are many equivalent formulations of Markov's principle.

== Statements of the principle ==
In the language of [[computability theory]], Markov's principle is a formal expression of the claim that if it is impossible that an algorithm does not terminate, then it does terminate. This is equivalent to the claim that if a set and its complement are both [[computably enumerable]], then the set is [[recursive set|decidable]]. 

In [[predicate logic]], if ''P'' is a predicate over the [[natural number]]s, it is expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;(\forall n (P(n) \vee \neg P(n)) \wedge \neg \forall n \neg P(n)) \rightarrow \exists n\;P(n)&lt;/math&gt;

That is, if ''P'' is decidable, and it cannot be false for every natural number ''n'', then it is true for some&amp;nbsp;''n''.  (In general, a predicate ''P'' over some domain is called ''decidable'' if for every ''x'' in the domain, either ''P''(''x'') is true, or ''P''(''x'') is not true, which is not always the case constructively.)

It is equivalent in the language of [[Heyting arithmetic|arithmetic]] to:
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \neg \exists n\;f(n)=0 \rightarrow \exists n\;f(n)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; a [[computable function|total recursive function]] on the natural numbers.

It is equivalent, in the language of [[real analysis]], to the following principles:

* For each real number ''x'', if it is contradictory that ''x'' is equal to 0, then there exists ''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;[[rational number|Q]] such that 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;|''x''|, often expressed by saying that ''x'' is [[apartness relation|apart]] from, or constructively unequal to,&amp;nbsp;0.
* For each real number ''x'', if it is contradictory that ''x'' is equal to&amp;nbsp;0, then there exists ''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;R such that ''xy''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

== Realizability ==

If constructive arithmetic is translated using [[realizability]] into a classical meta-theory that proves the &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-consistency of the relevant classical theory (for example, Peano Arithmetic if we are studying [[Heyting arithmetic]]), then Markov's principle is justified: a realizer is the constant function that takes a realization that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is not everywhere false to the [[unbounded search]] that successively checks if &lt;math&gt;P(0), P(1), P(2),\dots&lt;/math&gt; is true. If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is not everywhere false, then by &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-consistency there must be a term for which &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; holds, and each term will be checked by the search eventually. If however &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; does not hold anywhere, then the domain of the constant function must be empty, so although the search does not halt it still holds vacuously that the function is a realizer. By the Law of the Excluded Middle (in our classical metatheory), &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; must either hold nowhere or not hold nowhere, therefore this constant function is a realizer.

If instead the realizability interpretation is used in a constructive meta-theory, then it is not justified. Indeed, for first-order arithmetic, Markov's principle exactly captures the difference between a constructive and classical meta-theory. Specifically, a statement is provable in [[Heyting arithmetic]] with [[Church's thesis (constructive mathematics)|Extended Church's thesis]] if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in [[Heyting arithmetic]]; and it is provable in [[Heyting arithmetic]] with [[Church's thesis (constructive mathematics)|Extended Church's thesis]] ''and Markov's principle'' if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in [[Peano arithmetic]]. 

Modified [[realizability]] does not justify Markov's principle, even if classical logic is used in the meta-theory: there is no realizer in the language of [[simply typed lambda calculus]] as this language is not [[Turing-complete]] and arbitrary loops cannot be defined in it.

== Markov's rule ==
'''Markov's rule''' is the formulation of Markov's principle as a rule. It states that &lt;math&gt;\exists n\;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is derivable as soon as &lt;math&gt;\neg \neg \exists n\;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is, for &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; decidable. It was proved by Anne S. Troelstra&lt;ref&gt;Anne S. Troelstra. Metamathematical Investigation of Intuitionistic Arithmetic and Analysis, Springer Verlag (1973), Theorem 4.2.4 of the 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt; that Markov's rule is an [[admissible rule]] in [[Heyting arithmetic]]. Later on, the logician [[Harvey Friedman]] showed that Markov's rule is an admissible rule in all of [[intuitionistic logic]], [[Heyting arithmetic]], and various other intuitionistic theories,&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Friedman. Classically and Intuitionistically Provably Recursive Functions. In Scott, D. S. and Muller, G. H. Editors, Higher Set Theory, Volume 699 of Lecture Notes in Mathematics, Springer Verlag (1978), pp. 21–28.&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[Friedman translation]].

== Weak Markov's principle ==
A weaker form of Markov's principle may be stated in the language of analysis as

: &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in\mathbb{R}\ (\forall y\in\mathbb{R}\ \neg\neg(0&lt;y) \vee \neg\neg(y&lt;x)) \to 0&lt;x.&lt;/math&gt;

This form can be justified by [[L. E. J. Brouwer|Brouwer's]] [[Brouwer's continuity principles|continuity principles]], whereas the stronger form contradicts them. Thus it can be derived from intuitionistic, realizability, and classical reasoning, in each case for different reasons, but this principle is not valid in the general constructive sense of Bishop.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ulrich Kohlenbach]], "[http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.24.7455 On weak Markov's principle]". ''Mathematical Logic Quarterly'' (2002), vol 48, issue S1, pp. 59–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Glass of water with ice cubes.JPG|thumb|Ice cubes put in water will reach the 0 [[Celsius|°C]] melting point of ice when they start to melt.]]
The '''melting point''' (or, rarely, '''liquefaction point''') of a substance is the [[temperature]] at which it changes [[state of matter|state]] from [[solid]] to [[liquid]]. At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. The melting point of a substance depends on [[pressure]] and is usually specified at a [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard pressure]] such as 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] or 100 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]].

When considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the '''freezing point''' or '''crystallization point'''. Because of the ability of some substances to [[Supercooling|supercool]], the freezing point is not considered as a characteristic property of a substance. When the "characteristic freezing point" of a substance is determined, in fact the actual methodology is almost always "the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice", that is, the [[#Melting point measurements|melting point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/26/1/57.pdf |title= A new method of freezing-point determination for small quantities |author= Ramsay, J. A. |journal= [[J. Exp. Biol.]] |year= 1949 |volume= 26 |issue= 1 |pages= 57–64 |pmid= 15406812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most substances, [[melting]] and [[freezing]] points are approximately equal. For example, the melting point ''and'' freezing point of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] is 234.32 [[kelvin]]s (−38.83&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]] or −37.89&amp;nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|°F]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Haynes|Haynes]], p. 4.122.&lt;/ref&gt; However, certain substances possess differing solid-liquid transition temperatures. For example, [[agar]] melts at 85&amp;nbsp;°C (185&amp;nbsp;°F) and solidifies from {{Convert|31|C|F K}}; such direction dependence is known as [[hysteresis]]. The melting point of ice at 1 atmosphere of pressure is very close &lt;ref&gt;The melting point of purified water has been measured as 0.002519 ± 0.000002 °C, see {{cite journal|author1=Feistel, R.  |author2=Wagner, W.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year = 2006

&lt;/ref&gt; to {{Convert|0|C|F K}}; this is also known as the ice point. In the presence of [[Nucleation|nucleating substances]], the freezing point of [[water]] is not always the same as the melting point. In the absence of nucleators water can exist as a [[Supercooling|supercool]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ed liquid down to −48.3&amp;nbsp;°C (−55&amp;nbsp;°F, 224.8&amp;nbsp;K) before freezing.

The [[chemical element]] with the highest melting point is [[tungsten]], at {{Convert|3414|C|F K}};&lt;ref&gt;[[#Haynes|Haynes]], p. 4.123.&lt;/ref&gt; this property makes tungsten excellent for use as filaments in light bulbs. The often-cited [[carbon]] does not melt at ambient pressure but [[sublimation (physics)|sublimes]] at about {{Convert|3726.85|C|F K}}; a liquid phase only exists above pressures of {{Convert|10|MPa|atm|abbr=on}} and estimated {{Convert|4030-4430|C|F K}} (see [[:File:Carbon basic phase diagram.png|carbon phase diagram]]). [[Tantalum hafnium carbide]] (Ta&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;HfC&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) is a [[refractory]] compound with a very high melting point of 4215&amp;nbsp;K (3942&amp;nbsp;°C, 7128&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Researches on Systems with Carbides at High Melting Point and Contributions to the Problem of Carbon Fusion|journal=Z. Tech. Phys.|author1=Agte, C. |author2=Alterthum, H. |lastauthoramp=yes | volume= 11|year= 1930|pages=182–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the other end of the scale, [[helium]] does not freeze at all at normal pressure even at temperatures close to [[absolute zero]]; a pressure of more than twenty times normal [[atmospheric pressure]] is necessary.

==Melting point measurements==
{{main|Melting point apparatus}}
[[File:Koflerbank.jpg|thumb|Kofler bench with samples for calibration]]
Many [[laboratory techniques]] exist for the determination of melting points.
A [[Kofler bench]] is a metal strip with a temperature gradient (range from room temperature to 300&amp;nbsp;°C). Any substance can be placed on a section of the strip, revealing its thermal behaviour at the temperature at that point. [[Differential scanning calorimetry]] gives information on melting point together with its [[enthalpy of fusion]].

[[File:Krüss M5000.jpg|thumb|Automatic digital melting point meter]]
A basic melting point apparatus for the analysis of crystalline solids consists of an [[oil bath]] with a transparent window (most basic design: a [[Thiele tube]]) and a simple magnifier. The several grains of a solid are placed in a thin glass tube and partially immersed in the oil bath. The oil bath is heated (and stirred) and with the aid of the magnifier (and external light source) melting of the individual crystals at a certain temperature can be observed. In large/small devices, the sample is placed in a heating block, and optical detection is automated.

The measurement can also be made continuously with an operating process. For instance, oil refineries measure the freeze point of diesel fuel online, meaning that the sample is taken from the process and measured automatically. This allows for more frequent measurements as the sample does not have to be manually collected and taken to a remote laboratory.

===Techniques for refractory materials===
For refractory materials (e.g. platinum, tungsten, tantalum, some carbides and nitrides, etc.) the extremely high melting point (typically considered to be above, say, 1800&amp;nbsp;°C) may be determined by heating the material in a black body furnace and measuring the black-body temperature with an optical [[pyrometer]]. For the highest melting materials, this may require extrapolation by several hundred degrees. The spectral radiance from an incandescent body is known to be a function of its temperature. An optical pyrometer matches the radiance of a body under study to the radiance of a source that has been previously calibrated as a function of temperature. In this way, the measurement of the absolute magnitude of the intensity of radiation is unnecessary. However, known temperatures must be used to determine the calibration of the pyrometer. For temperatures above the calibration range of the source, an extrapolation technique must be employed. This extrapolation is accomplished by using [[Planck's law]] of radiation. The constants in this equation are not known with sufficient accuracy, causing errors in the extrapolation to become larger at higher temperatures. However, standard techniques have been developed to perform this extrapolation.

Consider the case of using gold as the source (mp = 1063&amp;nbsp;°C). In this technique, the current through the filament of the pyrometer is adjusted until the light intensity of the filament matches that of a black-body at the melting point of gold. This establishes the primary calibration temperature and can be expressed in terms of current through the pyrometer lamp. With the same current setting, the pyrometer is sighted on another black-body at a higher temperature. An absorbing medium of known transmission is inserted between the pyrometer and this black-body. The temperature of the black-body is then adjusted until a match exists between its intensity and that of the pyrometer filament. The true higher temperature of the black-body is then determined from Planck's Law. The absorbing medium is then removed and the current through the filament is adjusted to match the filament intensity to that of the black-body. This establishes a second calibration point for the pyrometer. This step is repeated to carry the calibration to higher temperatures. Now, temperatures and their corresponding pyrometer filament currents are known and a curve of temperature versus current can be drawn. This curve can then be extrapolated to very high temperatures.

In determining melting points of a refractory substance by this method, it is necessary to either have black body conditions or to know the [[emissivity]] of the material being measured. The containment of the high melting material in the liquid state may introduce experimental difficulties. Melting temperatures of some refractory metals have thus been measured by observing the radiation from a black body cavity in solid metal specimens that were much longer than they were wide. To form such a cavity, a hole is drilled perpendicular to the long axis at the center of a rod of the material. These rods are then heated by passing a very large current through them, and the radiation emitted from the hole is observed with an optical pyrometer. The point of melting is indicated by the darkening of the hole when the liquid phase appears, destroying the black body conditions. Today, containerless laser heating techniques, combined with fast pyrometers and spectro-pyrometers, are employed to allow for precise control of the time for which the sample is kept at extreme temperatures. Such experiments of sub-second duration address several of the challenges associated with more traditional melting point measurements made at very high temperatures, such as sample vaporization and reaction with the container.

==Thermodynamics==
[[File:Melting curve of water.svg|thumb|right|Pressure dependence of water melting point.]]
For a solid to melt, heat is required to raise its temperature to the melting point. However, further heat needs to be supplied for the melting to take place: this is called the [[heat of fusion]], and is an example of [[latent heat]].

From a thermodynamics point of view, at the melting point the change in [[Gibbs free energy]] (ΔG) of the material is zero, but the [[enthalpy]] (''H'') and the [[entropy]] (''S'') of the material are increasing (ΔH, ΔS &gt; 0). Melting phenomenon happens when the Gibbs free energy of the liquid becomes lower than the solid for that material. At various pressures this happens at a specific temperature. It can also be shown that:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta S = \frac {\Delta H} {T}&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''T'', ''ΔS'' and ''ΔH'' are respectively the [[temperature]] at the melting point, change of entropy of melting and the change of enthalpy of melting.

The melting point is sensitive to extremely large changes in [[pressure]], but generally this sensitivity is orders of magnitude less than that for the [[boiling point]], because the solid-liquid transition represents only a small change in volume.&lt;ref&gt;The exact relationship is expressed in the [[Clausius–Clapeyron relation]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mpec.sc.mahidol.ac.th/RADOK/physmath/PHYSICS/j10.htm |title= J10 Heat: Change of aggregate state of substances through change of heat content: Change of aggregate state of substances and the equation of Clapeyron-Clausius |accessdate= 19 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; If, as observed in most cases, a substance is more dense in the solid than in the liquid state, the melting point will increase with increases in pressure. Otherwise the reverse behavior occurs. Notably, this is the case of water, as illustrated graphically to the right, but also of Si, Ge, Ga, Bi. With extremely large changes in pressure, substantial changes to the melting point are observed. For example, the melting point of silicon at ambient pressure (0.1 MPa) is 1415&amp;nbsp;°C, but at pressures in excess of 10 GPa it decreases to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Tonkov, E. Yu. and Ponyatovsky, E. G. (2005) ''Phase Transformations of Elements Under High Pressure'', CRC Press, Boca Raton, p. 98 {{ISBN|0-8493-3367-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melting points are often used to characterize organic and inorganic compounds and to ascertain their [[wiktionary:Purity|purity]]. The melting point of a pure substance is always higher and has a smaller range than the melting point of an impure substance or, more generally, of mixtures. The higher the quantity of other components, the lower the melting point and the broader will be the melting point range, often referred to as the "pasty range". The temperature at which melting begins for a mixture is known as the "solidus" while the temperature where melting is complete is called the "liquidus". Eutectics are special types of mixtures that behave like single phases. They melt sharply at a constant temperature to form a liquid of the same composition. Alternatively, on cooling a liquid with the eutectic composition will solidify as uniformly dispersed, small (fine-grained) mixed crystals with the same composition.

In contrast to crystalline solids, [[glass]]es do not possess a melting point;
on heating they undergo a smooth [[glass transition]] into a [[viscous liquid]].
Upon further heating, they gradually soften, which can be characterized by certain [[softening point]]s.

==Freezing-point depression==
{{main|Freezing-point depression|Supercooling}}

The freezing point of a [[solvent]] is depressed when another compound is added, meaning that a [[solution]] has a lower freezing point than a pure solvent. This phenomenon is used in technical applications to avoid freezing, for instance by adding salt or ethylene glycol to water.

==Carnelley's rule==
In [[organic chemistry]], '''Carnelley's rule''', established in 1882 by [[Thomas Carnelley]], states that ''high [[molecular symmetry]] is associated with high melting point''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Melting Point and Molecular Symmetry |journal= [[Journal of Chemical Education]] |page= 724 |volume= 77 |issue= 6 |year= 2000 |doi= 10.1021/ed077p724 |author1=Brown, R. J. C.  |author2=R. F. C. |lastauthoramp=yes |bibcode = 2000JChEd..77..724B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnelley based his rule on examination of 15,000 chemical compounds. For example, for three [[structural isomer]]s with [[molecular formula]] C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; the melting point increases in the series [[isopentane]] −160&amp;nbsp;°C (113 K) [[n-pentane]] −129.8&amp;nbsp;°C (143 K) and [[neopentane]] −16.4&amp;nbsp;°C (256.8 K).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Haynes|Haynes]], pp. 6.153–155.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise in [[xylene]]s and also [[dichlorobenzene]]s the melting point increases in the order [[arene substitution patterns|meta, ortho and then para]]. [[Pyridine]] has a lower symmetry than [[benzene]] hence its lower melting point but the melting point again increases with [[diazine]] and [[triazine]]s. Many cage-like compounds like [[adamantane]] and [[cubane]] with high symmetry have relatively high melting points.

A high melting point results from a high [[heat of fusion]], a low [[entropy of fusion]], or a combination of both. In highly symmetrical molecules the crystal phase is densely packed with many efficient intermolecular interactions resulting in a higher enthalpy change on melting.

==Predicting the melting point of substances (Lindemann's criterion)==
An attempt to predict the bulk melting point of crystalline materials was first made in 1910 by [[Frederick Lindemann]].&lt;ref name="Lindemann1910"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lindemann FA |title=The calculation of molecular vibration frequencies |journal=Phys. Z. |volume=11 |year=1910 |pages=609–612 |authorlink=Frederick Lindemann}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind the theory was the observation that the average amplitude of thermal vibrations increases with increasing temperature. Melting initiates when the amplitude of vibration becomes large enough for adjacent atoms to partly occupy the same space. The '''Lindemann criterion''' states that melting is expected when the vibration [[root mean square amplitude]] exceeds a threshold value.

Assuming that all atoms in a crystal vibrate with the same frequency ''ν'', the average thermal energy can be estimated using the [[equipartition theorem]] as&lt;ref name=Sorkin&gt;Sorkin, S., (2003), [http://phycomp.technion.ac.il/~phsorkin/thesis/thesis.html Point defects, lattice structure, and melting], Thesis, Technion, Israel.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
 E = 4\pi^2 m \nu^2~u^2 = k_{\rm B} T
 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the [[atomic mass]], ''ν'' is the [[frequency]], ''u'' is the average vibration amplitude, ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]], and ''T'' is the [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]]. If the threshold value of ''u&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' is ''c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' where ''c'' is the [[Lindemann index|Lindemann constant]] and ''a'' is the [[atomic spacing]], then the melting point is estimated as
:&lt;math&gt;
 T_{\rm m} = \cfrac{4\pi^2 m \nu^2 c^2 a^2}{k_{\rm B}} .
 &lt;/math&gt;
Several other expressions for the estimated melting temperature can be obtained depending on the estimate of the average thermal energy. Another commonly used expression for the Lindemann criterion is&lt;ref name=Hofmann&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Hofmann|title=Solid state physics: an introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XfIpxi4kcM4C&amp;pg=PA67|accessdate=13 March 2011|year=2008|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=978-3-527-40861-0|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
 T_{\rm m} = \cfrac{4\pi^2 m \nu^2 c^2 a^2}{2k_{\rm B}} .
 &lt;/math&gt;
From the expression for the [[Debye frequency]] for ''ν'', we have
:&lt;math&gt;
 T_{\rm m} = \cfrac{2\pi m c^2 a^2 \theta_{\rm D}^2 k_{\rm B}}{h^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Debye temperature]] and ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]]. Values of ''c'' range from 0.15–0.3 for most materials.&lt;ref name=Nelson&gt;Nelson, D. R., (2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=YtYFAqswRzUC&amp;printsec=frontcover Defects and geometry in condensed matter physics], Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-00400-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mental projection''' is a supposed or experienced form of [[consciousness]]/[[spirit]]/[[intelligence]] projection from the emotional/[[astral plane]] to the [[mental plane]].  Adepts say they are able to project first to the emotional/astral plane (or directly from it after death) and then onward to the mental plane by completely calming their emotional processes and withdrawing their emotional senses.  Like [[astral projection]], mental projection is performed during sleep, between lives, during meditation-contemplation, or through 'psychic' (soulful) separation of the [[mental body]] from the emotional/astral body via the [[silver cord]].  Planes beyond the mental are accessible through use of the 'gold cord'.  According to many esoteric philosophers, when projecting in these higher planes one has no [[humanoid]] shape and is just a lotus- or egg-shaped '[[aura (paranormal)|auric]] body' of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur E Powell (1927), ''The Mental Body'', Theosophical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain philosophers consider the mental plane optimal for projection as it is divine enough to avoid black magic and 'lower psychism' yet also grounded enough to preserve a rational quality of experience (rational but not emotionally detached; mental encloses emotional).  Others think it is better to proceed beyond humanoid form to the causal and mental auras, as these reflections of yet higher formless consciousness also transcend deeper flaws of humanity (like 'egotistic self-identification') that cause the lower psychism.  These philosophers recommend striving to project into divine consciousness, not necessarily leaving one's lower consciousness, but becoming aware of spirit and divine will.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur E Powell (1972), ''The Causal Body and the Ego'', Theosophical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moral agency''' is an individual's ability to make [[morality|moral]] judgments based on some notion of [[ethics|right and wrong]] and to be held accountable for these actions.&lt;ref name="Angus20"&gt;{{cite book|last=Angus|first=Taylor|title=Animals &amp; Ethics: An Overview of the Philosophical Debate|publisher=Broadview Press|year=2003|location=Peterborough, Ontario|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''moral agent''' is "a being who is capable of acting with reference to right and wrong."&lt;ref&gt;[http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?resource=Webster%27s&amp;word=moral&amp;use1913=on "Moral,"] ''Websters Revised Unabridged Dictionary'', 1913, p. 943.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and analysis==
Most [[philosopher]]s suggest only [[rationality|rational]] beings, who can [[reason]] and form self-interested judgments, are capable of being moral agents. Some suggest those with limited rationality (for example, people who are mildly [[mentally disabled]] or infants&lt;ref name="Angus20" /&gt;) also have some basic moral capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Animal Rights, Environmental Ethics Debate: The Environmental Perspective|year=1992|publisher=State Univ. of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0-7914-0933-6|pages=3–4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8G4iDy1a0FcC&amp;pg=PA3 |editor=Hargrove, Eugene C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Determinist]]s argue all of our actions are the product of antecedent causes, and some believe this is [[Compatibilism|incompatible]] with [[free will]] and thus claim that we have no real control over our actions. [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that whether or not our [[real self]], the [[noumenon|noumenal]] self, can choose, we have no choice but to believe that we choose freely when we make a choice. This does not mean that we can ''control'' the effects of our actions.
Some Indeterminists would argue we have no free will either. If, with respect to human behaviour, a so-called 'cause' results in an indeterminate number of possible, so-called 'effects', that does not mean the person had the free-thinking independent will to choose that 'effect'. More likely, it was the indeterminate consequence of his chance genetics, chance experiences and chance circumstances relevant at the time of the 'cause'.

In Kant's philosophy, this calls for an act of faith, the faith free agent is based on something ''a priori'', yet to be known, or immaterial. Otherwise, without free agent's ''a priori'' fundamental source, socially essential concepts created from human mind, such as justice, would be undermined (responsibility implies freedom of choice) and, in short, civilization and human values would crumble.

It is useful to compare the idea of moral agency with the [[legal]] doctrine of ''[[mens rea]]'', which means guilty mind, and states that a person is legally responsible for what he does as long as he ''should'' know what he is doing, and his choices are deliberate. Some theorists discard any attempts to evaluate mental states and, instead, adopt the doctrine of ''[[strict liability]]'', whereby one is liable under the law without regard to capacity, and that the only thing is to determine the degree of [[punishment]], if any. Moral determinists would most likely adopt a similar point of view.

Psychologist [[Albert Bandura]] has observed that moral agents engage in selective [[moral disengagement]] in regards to their own inhumane conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bandura|first=Albert|title=Selective Moral Disengagement in the Exercise of Moral Agency|journal=Journal of Moral Education|date=June 2002|volume=31|issue=2|pages=101–119|doi=10.1080/0305724022014322|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0305724022014322#preview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction between moral agency and eligibility for moral consideration==
Many philosophers, such as Kant, view morality as a transaction among rational parties, i.e., among moral agents. For this reason, they would exclude other animals from moral consideration.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Others, such as [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] philosophers like [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[Peter Singer]] have argued the key to inclusion in the [[moral community]] is not rationality &amp;mdash; for if it were, we might have to exclude some disabled people and infants, and might also have to distinguish between the degrees of rationality of healthy adults &amp;mdash; but the real object of moral action is the avoidance of suffering. This is the [[argument from marginal cases]].

==Artificial moral agents==

The term artificial moral agent has taken on two usages.  The first is in debates on whether it is possible for an artificial system to be a moral agent - see [[Moral responsibility#Artificial systems and moral responsibility|artificial systems and moral responsibility]].
The second usage stems from efforts to construct machines with ethically-significant behaviors - see [[machine ethics]].  
The proper distinction between these two usages has itself been a [[Moral responsibility#Artificial systems and moral responsibility|key point of debate]].

'''''net.flag''''' is a work of [[internet art]] created in 2002 by [[Mark Napier (artist)|Mark Napier]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://softwareandart.com/?p=595 Artist Bio and work description]&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with ''[[Unfolding Object]]'' by [[John Simon (artist)|John Simon]], it was commissioned by the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://netflag.guggenheim.org/netflag net.flag on the Guggenheim website]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New York City]], and was among the first works of [[internet art]] to enter the permanent collection of a major museum.

''net.flag'' is an [[interactive]] work hosted on the Guggenheim museum's [[website]].  The site contains images of all the national [[flag]]s of the world.  Each flag is broken into its respective components, that are categorized according to several broadly descriptive terms. Users may pick and choose from a menu of these components to form a new flag, which they may then save to the site.  In addition, the project features a browsable history, through which users may look over past creations that have been titled and saved by the previous participants.

''net.flag'' creates a virtual territory. A limited [[language]] of visual [[symbols]] and the actions of thousands of visitors create an ongoing micro-drama about ownership, territory, control and [[Identity (social science)|personal identity]] in a post-national world.

Napier has described ''net.flag'' as "an emblem for the Internet as a new territory," &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/8920401/Permanence-Through-Change-The-Variable-Media-Approach Article by Jon Ippolito, ''Mark Napier net.flag,'' 2002] printed in ''Permanence Through Change: The Variable Media Approach'', p.108-114 © 2003 The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, and The Daniel Langlois Foundation for Art, Science, and Technology, Montreal. All rights reserved. {{ISBN|0-9684693-2-9}} Published by Guggenheim Museum Publications 1071 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10128&lt;/ref&gt; and is inspired in part by "Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong", the franchise nation depicted in [[Snow Crash]] by [[Neal Stephenson]].  In Stephenson's world geographical borders are re-mapped into [[Mobile computing|mobile]], [[modular]] elements.

'''Pareidolia''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ær|ɪ|ˈ|d|oʊ|l|i|ə}} {{respell|parr|i|DOH|lee|ə}}) is a psychological phenomenon in which the mind responds to a [[stimulation|stimulus]], usually an image or a sound, by perceiving a familiar pattern where none exists.

Common examples are perceived images of animals, faces, or objects in cloud formations, the [[Man in the Moon]], the [[Moon rabbit]], [[hidden message]]s in recorded music played in reverse or at higher- or lower-than-normal speeds, and hearing indistinct voices in random noise such as that produced by air conditioners or fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nautil.us/blog/why-we-hear-voices-in-random-noise |title=Why we hear voices in random noise |last=Jaekel |first=Philip |date= |website= |publisher=Nautilus |access-date=April 1, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word derives from the Greek words ''[[wikt:para-|para]]'' (παρά, "beside, alongside, instead [of]"&amp;nbsp;— in this context meaning something faulty or wrong) and the noun [[wikt:εἴδωλον|''eidōlon'']] (εἴδωλον "image, form, shape"&amp;nbsp;— the diminutive of ''[[Theory of Forms|eidos]]'').

== Explanations ==
[[File:Emojione BW 1F611.svg|thumb|A simple collection of lines can be quickly perceived as a face, and even be interpreted as expressing a particular emotion]]
Pareidolia can cause people to interpret random images, or patterns of light and shadow, as faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sagan |first=Carl |title=The Demon-Haunted World – Science as a Candle in the Dark |publisher=Random House |year=1995 |location=New York |isbn=0-394-53512-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 [[magnetoencephalography]] study found that objects perceived as faces evoke an early (165 &lt;abbr title="millseconds"&gt;ms&lt;/abbr&gt;) activation of the [[fusiform face area]] at a time and location similar to that evoked by faces, whereas other common objects do not evoke such activation. This activation is similar to a slightly faster time (130 ms) that is seen for images of real faces. The authors suggest that face perception evoked by face-like objects is a relatively early process, and not a late cognitive reinterpretation phenomenon.&lt;ref name="pmid19218867"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hadjikhani |first1=Nouchine |last2=Kveraga |first2=Kestutis |last3=Naik |first3=Paulami |last4=Ahlfors |first4=Seppo P. |title=Early (M170) activation of face-specific cortex by face-like objects |journal=NeuroReport |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=403–7 |year=2009 |pmid=19218867 |pmc=2713437 |doi=10.1097/WNR.0b013e328325a8e1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) study in 2011 similarly showed that repeated presentation of novel visual shapes that were interpreted as meaningful led to decreased fMRI responses for real objects. These results indicate that the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli depends upon processes similar to those elicited by known objects.&lt;ref name="pmid22079921"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Voss |first1=J. L. |last2=Federmeier |first2=K. D. |last3=Paller |first3=K. A. |title=The Potato Chip Really Does Look Like Elvis! Neural Hallmarks of Conceptual Processing Associated with Finding Novel Shapes Subjectively Meaningful |journal=Cerebral Cortex |volume=22 |issue=10 |pages=2354–64 |year=2012 |pmid=22079921 |pmc=3432238 |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhr315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These studies help to explain why people identify a few circles and a line as a "face" so quickly and without hesitation. [[Cognition|Cognitive processes]] are activated by the "face-like" object, which alert the observer to both the emotional state and [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] of the subject, even before the conscious mind begins to process or even receive the information.  A "stick figure face", despite its simplicity, can convey mood information, and be drawn to indicate emotions such as happiness or anger.  This robust and subtle capability is hypothesized to be the result of eons of natural selection favoring people most able to quickly identify the mental state, for example, of threatening people, thus providing the individual an opportunity to flee or attack pre-emptively.  In other words, processing this information subcortically&amp;nbsp;—  therefore subconsciously&amp;nbsp;— before it is passed on to the rest of the brain for detailed processing accelerates judgment and decision making when a fast reaction is needed.&lt;ref name="recog"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/13/health/psychology/13face.html |title=Facial Recognition – Brain – Faces, Faces Everywhere|publisher= The New York Times|access-date=July 3, 2010 | work=The New York Times | first=Elizabeth | last= Svoboda | date = 2007-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ability, though highly specialized for the processing and [[emotion recognition|recognition of ''human'' emotions]], also functions to determine the demeanor of wildlife.&lt;ref name="dog"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.paw-rescue.org/PAW/PETTIPS/DogTip_EmotionsInCaninesAndHumans.php | title= Dog Tips – Emotions in Canines and Humans|publisher=Partnership for Animal Welfare|access-date=July 3, 2010}}{{self-published inline|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pareidolia can be considered a subcategory of [[Apophenia]].

== Mimetoliths ==
Rocks may come to mimic recognizable forms through the random processes of formation, weathering and erosion. Most often, the size scale of the rock is larger than the object it resembles, such as a cliff profile resembling a human face. Well-meaning people with a new interest in fossils can pick up [[chert]] nodules, [[concretion]]s or pebbles resembling bones, skulls, turtle shells, dinosaur eggs, etc., in both size and shape.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Japanese researcher [[Chonosuke Okamura]] self-published a series of reports titled ''Original Report of the Okamura Fossil Laboratory'', in which he described tiny inclusions in polished [[limestone]] from the [[Silurian]] period (425 [[Year#Mya|mya]]) as being preserved [[fossil]] remains of tiny humans, gorillas, dogs, dragons, dinosaurs and other organisms, all of them only millimeters long, leading him to claim, "There have been no changes in the bodies of mankind since the Silurian period... except for a growth in stature from 3.5 mm to 1,700&amp;nbsp;mm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume6/v6i6/okamura-6-6.html |last=Spamer |first=E. |title=Chonosuke Okamura, Visionary |publisher=Academy of Natural Sciences |location=Philadelphia}} archived at [http://improbable.com/ Improbable Research].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The earwig's tail: a modern bestiary of multi-legged legends |first=May |last=Berenbaum |publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2009 | isbn=0-674-03540-2 | pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Okamura's research earned him an [[Ig Nobel Prize]] (a parody of the Nobel Prizes) in [[biodiversity]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/mar/16/highereducation.research |title=Tiny tall tales: Marc Abrahams uncovers the minute, but astonishing, evidence of our fossilised past |first=Marc |last=Abrahams |authorlink=Marc Abrahams |work=The Guardian |date=2004-03-16 |place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Science's most wanted: the top 10 book of outrageous innovators, deadly disasters, and shocking discoveries |series=Most Wanted |first1=Susan |last1=Conner |first2=Linda |last2=Kitchen |publisher=Brassey's |year=2002 |isbn=1-57488-481-6 |page = 93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projective tests ==
{{Main|Rorschach test}}
The [[Rorschach test|Rorschach inkblot test]] uses pareidolia in an attempt to gain insight into a person's mental state. The Rorschach is a projective test, as it intentionally elicits the thoughts or feelings of respondents that are "projected" onto the ambiguous inkblot images.&lt;ref name="zusne" /&gt;

== Art ==
[[File:Giuseppe Arcimboldo - The Jurist - WGA00837.jpg|thumbnail|''[[The Jurist (painting)|The Jurist]]'' by [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]], 1566. What appears to be its face is a collection of fish and poultry.]]
In his notebooks, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] wrote of pareidolia as a device for painters, writing, "If you look at any walls spotted with various stains or with a mixture of different kinds of stones, if you are about to invent some scene you will be able to see in it a resemblance to various different landscapes adorned with mountains, rivers, rocks, trees, plains, wide valleys, and various groups of hills. You will also be able to see divers combats and figures in quick movement, and strange expressions of faces, and outlandish costumes, and an infinite number of things which you can then reduce into separate and well conceived forms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://archive.org/stream/leonardodavincis007918mbp/leonardodavincis007918mbp_djvu.txt | editor1-last =John | editor1-first = R | editor2-first =J | editor2-last = Don Read| first =Leonardo | last = Da Vinci | title = Note-Books Arranged And Rendered Into English| publisher =Empire State Book Co |year= 1923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Two 13th century edifices in Turkey display architectural use of shadows of stone carvings at the entrance. Outright pictures are avoided in Islam but  tessellations and calligraphic pictures were allowed, so "accidental" silhouettes became a creative escape. 
*[[Ni%C4%9Fde#Sightseeing|Alaaddin Mosque]], [[Niğde]], [[Turkey]] ([[1223]]) with its "mukarnas" art where the shadows of three-dimensional ornamentation with stone masonry around the entrance form a [[chiaroscuro]] drawing of a woman's face with a crown and long hair appearing at a specific time, at some specific days of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nevsehirkentrehberim.com/?Bid=1047024 Niğde Alaaddin Camii ’nin Kapısındaki Kadın Silüetinin Sırrı?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nigdekulturturizm.gov.tr/TR,74357/camiler.html Camiler, ALÂEDDİN CAMİ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wha.com.tr/en/world_heritages_of_turkey_tentative_lists_33.php HISTORICAL MONUMENTS OF NIGDE]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Divriği Great Mosque and Hospital]] in [[Sivas]], [[Turkey]] ([[1229]]) shows shadows of the 3 dimensional ornaments of both entrances of the mosque part, to cast a giant shadow of a praying man that changes pose as the sun moves, as if to illustrate what the purpose of the building is. Another detail is the difference in the impressions of the clothing of the two shadow-men indicating two different styles, possibly to tell who is to enter through which door.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fotogaleri.haberler.com/divrigi-ulu-camii-nde-namaz-kilan-insan/ DİVRİĞİ ULU CAMİİ'NDE 'NAMAZ KILAN İNSAN' SİLÜETİ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious ==
{{Further information|Perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena}}
There have been many instances of perceptions of religious imagery and themes, especially the faces of religious figures, in ordinary phenomena. Many involve images of [[Jesus]],&lt;ref name="zusne"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Zusne | first1 =Leonard | first2 =Warren H | last2 = Jones |title=Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=1989 |isbn= 0-8058-0508-7 |pages= 77–79 |url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0805805087 | access-date = 2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/23/nyregion/in-a-tree-trunk-in-new-jersey-some-see-our-lady-of-guadalupe.html | newspaper = The New York Times | title = In New Jersey, a Knot in a Tree Trunk Draws the Faithful and the Skeptical | date = July 23, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the word [[Allah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Yahaya | last = Ibrahim | title = In Maiduguri, a tree with engraved name of God turns spot to a Mecca of sorts| date = 2011-01-02 | url = http://sundaytrust.com.ng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5698:in-maiduguri-a-tree-with-engraved-name-of-god-turns-spot-to-a-mecca-of-sorts&amp;catid=17:community-news-kanem-trust&amp;Itemid=28| work = Sunday Trust | publisher =Media Trust Limited, Abuja| access-date = 2012-03-21 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104031545/http://sundaytrust.com.ng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5698:in-maiduguri-a-tree-with-engraved-name-of-god-turns-spot-to-a-mecca-of-sorts&amp;catid=17:community-news-kanem-trust&amp;Itemid=28 | archivedate = 2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other religious phenomena: in September 2007 in [[Singapore]], for example, a [[callus (cell biology)|callus]] on a tree resembled a [[monkey]], leading believers to pay homage to the "Monkey god" (either [[Sun Wukong]] or [[Hanuman]]) in the [[monkey tree phenomenon]].&lt;ref name="Ng Hui Hui"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/printfriendly/0,4139,141806,00.html | last =Ng | first = Hui Hui |title= Monkey See, Monkey Do? | work = [[The New Paper]] |date=13 September 2007 |pages=12–13 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071014083330/http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/printfriendly/0,4139,141806,00.html |archivedate= 2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publicity surrounding sightings of religious figures and other surprising images in ordinary objects has spawned a market for such items on online auctions like [[eBay]].  One famous instance was a grilled cheese sandwich with the face of the Virgin Mary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4034787.stm |title= 'Virgin Mary' toast fetches $28,000 |publisher=BBC News |date=23 November 2004 |access-date= 2006-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer vision ==
[[File:Aurelia-aurita-3-0049 (cropped).jpg|thumbnail|Given an image of jellyfish swimming, the [[DeepDream]] program can be encouraged to "see" the faces and legs of dogs]]
Pareidolia also arises in [[computer vision]],&lt;ref&gt;Chalup, Stephan K., Kenny Hong, and Michael J. Ostwald. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephan_Chalup/publication/228735838_Simulating_Pareidolia_of_Faces_for_Architectural_Image_Analysis/links/0fcfd511b3ff280efe000000/Simulating-Pareidolia-of-Faces-for-Architectural-Image-Analysis.pdf Simulating pareidolia of faces for architectural image analysis]." brain 26.91 (2010): 100.&lt;/ref&gt; specifically in [[Computer vision#Recognition|image recognition]] programs, which can spuriously detect [[feature (machine learning)|features]]. In the case of an [[artificial neural network]], higher-level features correspond to more recognizable features, and enhancing these features brings out what the computer sees. These reflect the training set of images that the network has "seen" previously.

Striking visuals can be produced in this way, notably in the [[DeepDream]] software, which falsely detects and then exaggerates features such as eyes and faces in any image.

== Speech ==
In 1971 [[Konstantīns Raudive]] wrote ''Breakthrough'', detailing what he believed was the discovery of [[electronic voice phenomenon|electronic voice phenomena]] (EVP). EVP has been described as auditory pareidolia.&lt;ref name="zusne" /&gt; Allegations of [[backmasking]] in popular music, in which a listener claims a message has been recorded backward onto a track meant to be played forward, have also been described as auditory pareidolia.&lt;ref name="zusne" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vokey |first1=John R. |last2=Read |first2=J. Don |title=Subliminal messages: Between the devil and the media |journal=American Psychologist |volume=40 |issue=11 |pages=1231–9 |year=1985 |pmid=4083611 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.40.11.1231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the psychologist [[Diana Deutsch]] invented an algorithm for producing phantom words and phrases with the sounds coming from two stereo loudspeakers, with one to the listener's left and the other to his right. Each loudspeaker produces a phrase consisting of two words or syllables. The same sequence is presented repeatedly through both loudspeakers; however, they are offset in time so that when the first sound (word or syllable) is coming from the speaker on the left, the second sound is coming from the speaker on the right, and vice versa. After listening for a while, phantom words and phrases suddenly emerge, and these often appear to reflect what is on the listener's mind, and they transform perceptually into different words and phrases as the sequence continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://philomel.com/musical_illusions/|last1=Deutsch |first1=D. |title=Musical Illusions and Paradoxes|journal=Philomel Records|year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://philomel.com/phantom_words/|last1=Deutsch |first1=D. |title=Phantom Words and Other Curiosities|journal=Philomel Records|year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related phenomena ==
Various European ancient [[divination]] practices involved the interpretation of shadows cast by objects. For example, in [[molybdomancy]], a random shape produced by pouring molten tin into cold water is interpreted by the shadow it casts in candlelight.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

A [[shadow person]] (also known as a shadow figure, shadow being or black mass) is often attributed to pareidolia. It is the perception of a patch of shadow as a living, humanoid figure, particularly as interpreted by believers in the [[paranormal]] or [[supernatural]] as the presence of a spirit or other entity.&lt;ref name="Idiot's Guide"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahlquist|first=Diane|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Life After Death|year=2007|publisher=Penguin Group|location=USA|isbn=978-1-59257-651-7|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0lkscwxGSoAC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=dark+shadow+entity+corner+eye#v=onepage&amp;q=dark%20shadow%20entity%20corner%20eye&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pareidolia is also what some skeptics believe causes people to believe that they have seen [[Ghost#Scientific view|ghosts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/pareidol.html |title=pareidolia |last=Carroll |first=Robert Todd |date= June 2001|work=skepdic.com |access-date=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Parity was formed in 1986 as the "Campaign for Equal State Pension Ages" (CESPA) &lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2003998.stm BBC NEWS | Business | Threat to National Insurance increase&lt;!-- Both generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and its principal aim was to obtain for men the same [state pension] age as enjoyed by women.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The organisation changed its name to "Parity" in 1997 to reflect growing concern regarding increased unequal treatment of men and women in other areas by the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hertsdirect.org/comdirectory/comvol/trade2y/tdfina3y/pensions4/?view=Printlist hertsdirect.org Pensions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

CESPA's inaugural meeting was held on 29 August 1986 in Committee Room 1 of Manchester Town Hall. The ten founder members were G.W. Alderton, D.Higgins, D.J.D Yarwood, J.H Bennett, E.L Anderson, J.Greenwood, M.D Davidson, J.Graham, D.G Lindsay, and J. Bradfield.
The original CESPA constitution was agreed. The meeting appointed David Lindsay as Chairman, Geoff Alderton as Vice-Chairman, David Yarwood as Hon Secretary and John Bennett as Treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parity-uk.org/history_of_cespa1.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Parity was denied charitable status for a number of years because it was seeking changes in the law to redress statutory [[sex discrimination]], and thus was deemed to be political.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-912855991.html Parity &amp; Equal rights for men - Mankind | HighBeam Research - FREE trial&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It finally gained [[Charitable organization#United Kingdom|charitable status]] in 2005 following a change to the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Organisation==
The organisation is run entirely by volunteers and receives no public funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parity-uk.org/organisation.php Parity - Campaigning for equal rights for UK men and women&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It had an income of £1,016 in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/PrintReport.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1107795&amp;ReportType=BW Charity-commission.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

In its constitution it states its objectives are "to promote and protect the equal rights of men and women to the enjoyment of all civil, political, economic social and cultural rights under the law" and "to institute proceedings in the UK or appropriate European Courts for the purpose of establishing or protecting any such equal rights."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parity-uk.org/index.php Parity - Campaigning for equal rights for UK men and women&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==
Parity has had some notable successes over the years, particularly in addressing statutory sex discrimination. Their campaigns have stopped government [[sex discrimination]] which, in the case of winter fuel payments, had denied an estimated £20 million per year to males between the ages of 60-65.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/567208.stm BBC News | UK | Winter fuel payments 'sexist'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parity claims successes in four main areas: [[Prescription (medical)|prescription]] charges, winter fuel payments, [[Bus_pass#UK|bus travel concessions]] and, in association with others, [[widower]]'s benefits:

===Prescription charges===
Parity's first major success began in 1993 under its original name, when CESPA member Cyril Richardson, an [[asthmatic]], took the government to court over sex discrimination in entitlement for free [[Prescription drug|prescriptions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=16471 Equal rights for men at the chemist's - Article - TES Connect&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2001/rp01-080.pdf The Travel Concessions (Eligibility) Bill [HL&amp;#93; Bill 38 of 2001-02&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618214600/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2001/rp01-080.pdf |date=18 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, in 1995 the European Court of Justice ruled that it was unlawful to charge men aged 60–65 for prescriptions when they were free to women. As a result, men now receive benefits in the order of an estimated £30 million per annum. Additionally, £10 million in charges was refunded to those who had wrongly paid for prescriptions in the previous 3 months before the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ay06C8wAdAAC&amp;pg=PA705&amp;lpg=PA705&amp;dq=1995+nhs+prescription+charges+men&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J7Ec4-rWx0&amp;sig=K1uuQ8Ttlf3tWYz4EuM37bl9JHg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DoTiSf6MM8WhjAfT7bnUDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4 The textbook of pharmaceutical medicine - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/311/7013/1118/a Men can have free prescriptions at 60 - 311 (7013): 1118 - bmj.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Winter fuel payments===
In 1998 Parity member John Taylor went to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] to contest the fact that the government was denying [[winter fuel payment]]s to men aged 60–65 that women were able to receive. It was argued that this was a breach of European laws on equality in social security,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/189612.stm BBC News | UK | Winter fuel case goes to Europe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and that such discrimination was blatant and unjustifiable.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/winter-fuel-cash-cheats-men-says-court-chief-1121423.html Winter fuel cash cheats men, says court chief - News - The Independent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The case was referred to the [[European Court of Justice]] who ruled in Mr Taylor's favour in December 1999.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The ruling meant up to £26 million per annum in benefits being given to men that otherwise would have been denied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/455023.stm BBC News | UK Politics | Fuel payments ruling due&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bus travel concessions===
In 2000 Parity took the Government to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] over the fact that it denied [[free travel pass|free bus travel]] to men aged 60–65.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.thisisyork.co.uk/2000/4/28/317100.html Postman leads fight to change bus pass policy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070730222225/http://archive.thisisyork.co.uk/2000/4/28/317100.html |date=30 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Parity's previous successes, the government had refused to end discrimination in this area.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ministers-fight-free-bus-pass-for-men-at-60-634573.html Ministers fight free bus pass for men at 60 - UK Politics, UK - The Independent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in June 2001 it became clear that Parity would win the case if it went to court and the government relented, with [[John Prescott]] announcing men would receive free [[bus pass]]es from age 60. Controversially, Prescott hailed the move as "another example of the Government providing extra help for pensioners" whereas it had effectively been forced into the move by the European Court of Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1323123/Men-over-60-to-be-eligible-for-free-bus-passes.html Men over 60 to be eligible for free bus passes - Telegraph&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Travel Concessions (Eligibility) Bill finally passed in 2003 resulting in males receiving the £50 million per annum in benefits that the state had denied them.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2880989.stm BBC NEWS | Business | End to 'sexist' bus fares&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Widowers benefits===
Parity campaigned to end sexism in the payment of widows benefits and bereavement tax allowances. These were previously only paid to women and not men. The campaign achieved success in 2001 as a result the benefits are now available to both genders.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2002647.stm BBC NEWS | Business | Widowers besiege Europe with benefit claims&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic violence statistics===
In 2008 Parity campaigned to stop the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] making false statements that the "overwhelming" majority of domestic violence victims were women, whereas in fact about one in three victims is male. With the aid of the [[UK Statistics Authority]] the organisation succeeded and the incorrect claims were removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports---correspondence/correspondence/new-component.pdf Statisticsauthority.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports---correspondence/correspondence/letter-from-sir-roger-jowell-to-keir-starmer-qc-30-march-2009.pdf Statisticsauthority.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation also forced [[Gillian Morgan]] of the [[Welsh Assembly]] to stop making the same claims in the "Strategic Action Plan to Address Violence to Women".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports---correspondence/correspondence/Copy_of_letter-from-sir-michael-scholar-to-dame-gillian-morgan-021009.pdf Statisticsauthority.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current campaigns==
Parity's main current campaign is to equalise the state [[pension]] ages for men and women in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parity-uk.org/successes.php Parity - Campaigning for equal rights for UK men and women&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently this is now due to take place in 2018.

[[File:Plasma Cutter.jpg|thumb|A plasma torch cutter]]
A '''plasma torch''' (also known as a '''plasma arc''', '''plasma gun''', or '''plasma cutter''', '''plasmatron''') is a device for generating a directed flow of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Jeffus | first1 = Larry F. | title = Welding: principles and applications | publisher = Cengage Learning | date = 2002 | pages = 180 | isbn = 978-1-4018-1046-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Szałatkiewicz | first1 = J. | title = Safety and intelligent control system for plasmatron application | doi = 10.5604/01.3001.0010.2942 | journal = Journal of KONES Powertrain and Transport | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 6 | year = 2017 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = |url= http://www.pjoes.com/pdf/23.1/Pol.J.Environ.Stud.Vol.23.No.1.277-281.pdf | doi-broken-date = 2018-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plasma jet can be used for applications including [[plasma cutting]], [[plasma arc welding]], [[plasma spraying]], and [[plasma gasification]] for waste disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Szałatkiewicz | first1 = J. | title = Energy Recovery from Waste of Printed Circuit Boards in Plasmatron Plasma Reactor | doi = | journal = Polish Journal of Environmental Studies | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 5 | year = 2014 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = |url= http://kones.eu/ep/2017/vol24/no2/247-252_J_O_KONES_2017_NO._2,_VOL._24,_ISSN1231-4005_SZALATKIEWICZ.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of thermal plasma torches==
[[Plasma (physics)#Thermal vs. non-thermal plasmas|Thermal plasmas]] are generated in plasma torches by [[direct current]] (DC), [[alternating current]] (AC), [[radio-frequency]] (RF) and other discharges. DC torches are the most commonly used and researched, because when compared to AC: “there is less flicker generation and noise, a more stable operation, better control, a minimum of two electrodes, lower electrode consumption, slightly lower refractory [heat] wear and lower power consumption”.&lt;ref name="Gomez"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.04.017 |author=Gomez, E. |author2=Rani, D.A. |author3=Cheeseman, C.R. |author4=Deegan, D. |author5=Wise, M. |author6=Boccaccini, A.R. |date=2009 |title=Thermal plasma technology for the treatment of wastes: A critical review |journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials |volume=161 |issue=2–3 |pages=614–626 |pmid=18499345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermal plasma DC torches, non-transferred arc, based on hot cathode===
[[File:Non-transferred DC plasma torch.png|800px|Cross-sectional representation of a non-transferred DC plasma torch. Showing the pointed cathode and annular anode. The inlets and outlets of the water-cooling system are labelled, note that the arc temperature can be up to 15 000°C. The plasma arc is drawn for illustration purposes only. Not to scale.]]

In a DC torch, the [[Plasma (physics)#Generation of artificial plasma|electric arc]] is formed between the [[electrodes]] (which can be made of copper, [[tungsten]], [[graphite]], [[molybdenum]], silver etc.), and the thermal plasma is formed from the continual input of carrier/working gas, projecting outward as a plasma jet/flame (as can be seen on the right). In DC torches, the carrier gas can be, for example, either oxygen, nitrogen, argon, helium, air, or hydrogen;&lt;ref name="Gomez" /&gt; and although termed as such, it does not have to be a gas (thus, better termed a carrier fluid).

For example, a research plasma torch at the Institute of Plasma Physics (IPP) in Prague, Czech Republic, functions with an [[H2O|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] vortex (as well as a small addition of argon to ignite the arc), and produces a high temperature/velocity plasma flame.&lt;ref name=Hrabovsky&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hrabovský|first=Milan|author2=Kopecky, V.|author3= Sember, V.|author4=  Kavka, T.|author5=   Chumak, O.|author6=    Konrad, M.|title=Properties of Hybrid Water/Gas DC Arc Plasma Torch|journal=IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science|date=August 2006|volume=34|issue=4|pages=1566–1575|bibcode = 2006ITPS...34.1566H |doi = 10.1109/TPS.2006.878365 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, early studies of arc stabilization employed a water-vortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kavka|first=T|author2=Chumak, O. |author3=Sember, V. |author4=Hrabovsky, M. |title=Processes in Gerdien arc generated by hybrid gas-water torch|journal=28th ICPIG|date=July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the electrode materials and carrier fluids have to be specifically matched to avoid excessive electrode corrosion or oxidation (and contamination of materials to be treated), while maintaining ample power and function.

Furthermore, the flow-rate of the carrier gas can be raised to promote a larger, more projecting plasma jet, provided that the arc current is sufficiently increased; and vice versa.

The plasma flame of a real plasma torch is a few inches long at most; it is to be distinguished from [[Plasma weapon (fiction)|fictional long-range plasma weapons]].

====Transferred vs. non-transferred====
It is important to note that there are two types of DC torches: non-transferred and transferred. In non-transferred DC torches, the electrodes are inside the body/housing of the torch itself (creating the arc there). Whereas in transferred—one electrode is outside (and is usually the conductive material to be treated), allowing the arc to form outside of the torch over a larger distance.

A benefit of transferred DC torches is that the plasma arc is formed outside the water-cooled body, preventing heat loss—as is the case with non-transferred torches, where their electrical-to-thermal efficiency can be as low as 50%, but the hot water can itself be utilized.&lt;ref name="Hrabovsky" /&gt; Furthermore, transferred DC torches can be used in a twin-torch setup, where one torch is [[Cathodic#Chemistry cathode|cathodic and the other anodic]], which has the earlier benefit of a regular transferred single-torch system, but allows their use with [[Insulator (electricity)|non-conductive]] materials, as there is no need for it to form the other electrode.&lt;ref name="Gomez" /&gt; However, these types of setups are rare as most common non-conductive materials do not require the precise cutting ability of a plasma torch. In addition, the discharge generated by this particular plasma source configuration is characterized by a complex shape and fluid dynamics that  requires a 3D description in order to be predicted, making performance unsteady. The electrodes of non-transferred torches are larger, because they suffer more wear by the plasma arc.

The quality of plasma produced is a function of density (pressure), temperature and torch power (the greater the better). With regards to the efficiency of the torch itself—this can vary among manufacturers and torch technology; though for example, Leal-Quirós reports that for Westinghouse Plasma Corp. torches “a thermal efficiency of 90% is easily possible; the efficiency represents the percentage of arc power that exits the torch and enters the process”.&lt;ref name="Leal-Quiros"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leal-Quirós, Edbertho |date=2004 |title=Plasma Processing of Municipal Solid Waste |journal= Brazilian Journal of Physics |volume=34 |issue=4B |page=1587 |bibcode = 2004BrJPh..34.1587L |doi=10.1590/S0103-97332004000800015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6867">In the [[law]] of [[evidence]], a '''presumption''' of a particular fact can be made without the aid of proof in some situations. The invocation of a presumption shifts the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] from one party to the opposing party in a court trial.

There are two types of presumption: [[rebuttable presumption]] and [[conclusive presumption]]. A rebuttable presumption is assumed true until a person proves otherwise (for example the [[presumption of innocence]]). In contrast, a conclusive (or irrebuttable) presumption cannot be refuted in any case (such as [[defense of infancy]] in some legal systems).

Presumptions are sometimes categorized into two types: presumptions without basic facts, and presumptions with basic facts. In the United States, mandatory presumptions are impermissible in criminal cases, but permissible presumptions are allowed.

An example of presumption without basic facts is [[presumption of innocence]].&lt;ref&gt;Technically, the presumption of innocence is not a presumption, but rather is a rhetorical expression that emphasizes that the prosecution bears the burden of proof in a criminal case. The accused has no obligation to adduce evidence in their favor and is automatically acquitted unless the prosecution proves guilt [[beyond a reasonable doubt]]. See [[presumption of innocence]].&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of presumption ''with'' basic facts is [[Declared death in absentia]], e.g., the law says if a person has been missing for seven years or more (basic fact), that person is presumed dead.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==History==

The ancient Jewish law code, the [[Talmud]], included reasoning from presumptions (''hazakah''), propositions taken to be true unless there was reason to believe otherwise, such as "One does not ordinarily pay a debt before term."&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same concept was found in ancient [[Roman law]], where, for example, if there was doubt as to whether a child was really the issue of someone who had left money in a will, the presumption was in favour of the child.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Roman and [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] graded presumptions according to strength: light, medium or probable, and violent.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt; These gradings and many individual presumptions were taken over into [[English law]] in the seventeenth century by [[Edward Coke]].&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific presumptions==
A number of presumptions are found in most [[common law]] jurisdictions.  Examples of these presumptions include:
*The [[presumption of death]].  A person who has been absent for seven years without explanation and "gone to parts unknown" is presumed dead at common law.&lt;ref&gt;''Prudential Insurance Comp. v. Moore'', 197 Ind. 50, 149 N.E. 718 (Ind. 1925)&lt;/ref&gt;  The time period it takes for the presumption to arise has often been modified by statute.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ind. Code § 29-2-5-1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[presumption of sanity]]. A person who faces criminal trial is presumed sane until the opposite is proved.  Similarly, a person is presumed to have testamentary capacity until there is evidence to undermine that presumption.
*The [[presumption of innocence]], which holds that the prosecution bears the burden of proof in a criminal case with the result that the accused may be acquitted without putting forward any evidence.
*The [[presumption of legitimacy]] or [[presumption of paternity]], which presumes that a husband is the [[biological father]] of a child born to his wife during the marriage, or within nine months after the marriage is ended by death, [[legal separation]], or [[divorce]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ind. Code § 31-14-7-1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some jurisdictions also hold that a presumption of paternity arises when a father accepts a child into his home, or publicly represents that he is the child's father.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ind. Code § 31-14-7-2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[presumption of survivorship]] has referred to a number of different presumptions.  The term is sometimes used to refer to presumptions that one or another of two persons lived the longer when [[simultaneous death|they died together in the same accident]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]] (5th. ed., 1979; West Publishing Co., {{ISBN|0-8299-2041-2}}), p. 1068, "Presumption of survivorship"&lt;/ref&gt;  The presumption that two or more people who establish a [[joint account]] intend for the survivors to have the assets put into the fund upon the death of one of the joint account holders has also been called the "presumption of survivorship".&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''Matter of Estate of Banko'', 622 N.E.2d 476 (Ind. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[presumption of mailing]] presumes that a properly addressed letter delivered to the post office or a [[common carrier]] was in fact delivered and received by the addressee.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''U-Haul Co. of Indiana, Inc. v. Indiana Dept. of State Revenue'', 896 N.E.2d 1253 (Ind.Tax 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
*The presumption of [[fraud]] or [[undue influence]] arises where a person in a position of [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] over another, such as a [[guardianship|guardian]] or the holder of a [[power of attorney]] applies the other person's assets to his or her own benefit.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Estate of Compton'', 919 N.E.2d 1181, (Ind.Ct.App. 2010), trans. denied&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[presumption of validity]] is another way of expressing a burden of proof: the official acts of courts are presumed valid, and those who would challenge them must overcome this presumption.&lt;ref&gt;''Monon Corp. v. Townsend, Yosha, Cline &amp; Price'', 678 N.E.2d 807, 809 (Ind.Ct.App. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; This is also termed the [[presumption of regularity]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Simon &amp; Murphy, Peter &amp; Beaumont, John. Cases &amp; Materials on Evidence. Fourth Edition. Oxford University Press. 1994. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[presumption of advancement]] in relation to transfers from husbands to wives and from fathers to children.
*In the law of the United States, the [[presumption of constitutionality]] presumes that all statutes are drafted in accordance with [[Constitution of the United States|Federal]] and [[State constitution (United States)|state]] constitutional requirements.  The party challenging the constitutionality of a statute bears the burden of proof, and any doubts are resolved against that party. If there are two reasonable interpretations of a statute, one of which is constitutional and the other not, the courts choose the path that permits upholding the statute.&lt;ref&gt;''Boehm v. Town of St. John'', 675 N.E.2d 318 (Ind.1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31212">'''Ragging''' is the term used for the so-called "initiation ritual" practiced in higher education institutions in South Asian countries, including [[India]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The practice is similar to [[hazing]] in North America, [[bizutage]] in France, [[praxe]] in Portugal and other similar practices in educational institutions across the world. Ragging involves abuse, humiliation or harassment of new entrants or junior students by their seniors. It often takes a malignant form wherein the newcomers may be subjected to [[psychological torture|psychological]] or [[physical torture|physical]] torture.&lt;ref name=definition-ngo&gt;{{cite news

In 2009 the [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] of India imposed regulations upon Indian universities to help curb ragging, and launched a [[Toll-free telephone number|toll-free]] 'anti-ragging helpline'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Report 2010-2011|url=http://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/6965381_Annual-2010-11.pdf|publisher=[[University Grants Commission (India)]]|accessdate=2 July 2016|page=29|quote=Section 1.3(j) Anti-Ragging Cell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

Inception of ragging can be pleasant at first, hence the name 'Mal Samaya'. During this week or so, all newcomers are ordered to memorize the name and hometown of their peers. The objective of this exercise is said to be increasing the friendship among batch mates (locally termed as ''batch fit'').

==Dress code ragging==

The freshmen are asked to dress in a specific dress code for a particular period of time. The dress code prescribed is generally unusual, e.g. dressing completely in white or black with the hair oiled and combed in a particular style, dressing shirts that do not contain stripes, dressing long skirts for girls. Dress code ragging may make freshmen feel uncomfortable, as it often brings them unnecessary attention from everybody else.

==Verbal torture==

Verbal torture involves indulging in loose talks{{clarify|date=September 2017}}. The freshmen may be asked to sing the lyrics of any vulgar song or use abusive language in the presence of a large number of peers.  During this time, seniors assign an abusive and demeaning nickname, known as ''card'' to the juniors and they have to be called by that name throughout their entire university life. In some universities, this nickname is changed to a less vulgar name after the ragging period. These aliases are used primarily as a means of preventing the university authorities identifying the students who are involved in ragging and other unlawful activities. The form of verbal ragging differs from one institution to another. In some universities, students have to memorize poems made up of filth and recite them in front of others.

== Physical  torture ==
The freshers are asked to do various tasks, such as [[Sit-ups (punishment)|sit-ups]] or push-ups, sitting in the [[Murga punishment|murga]] pose, being forced to call seniors as sir, or removing their shirts. On an attempt to resist carrying out the activities, they may beat the fresher with baseball bats or slap them. 

Though, in India, if a complaint is lodged against that senior, they (and others who were present that time) will be given a strict punishment such as expulsion from university, imprisonment for a year etc.

== Academic performance ==
The seniors may attempt to harass or threaten the junior to complete their assignments, bunk classes, not to take part in any activities or be a part of clubs etc. 

Although, it comes under extreme cases of ragging and on complaint will lead to strict punishment to the seniors

==In India==

Highly reputed Indian colleges have a history of ragging especially medical colleges. It has become increasingly unpopular due to several complaints of serious injury to the victims and stringent laws pertaining to ragging. Ragging is now defined as an act that violates or is perceived to violate an individual student's dignity.&lt;ref name="toi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharma|first1=Naresh|last2=Bodh|first2=Anand|title=Medical student killed in ragging|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Medical-student-killed-in-ragging/articleshow/4247603.cms|accessdate=9 November 2016|publisher=Times of India|date=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Supreme Court orders, a National [http://www.ugc.ac.in/page/helpline.aspx Anti-Ragging Helpline] was launched by the Indian government.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A high-level committee in 2009, which probed the death of Aman Kachroo, revealed that alcohol was the main reason leading to serious form of ragging and violence in the campus.

A report from 2007 highlights 42 instances of physical injury, and reports on ten deaths purportedly the result of ragging:&lt;ref name=india&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ragging has reportedly caused at least 30–31 deaths in the last seven years. In the 2007 session, approximately seven ragging deaths have been reported. In addition, a number of freshmen were severely traumatised to the extent that they were admitted to mental institutions.
Ragging in India commonly involves serious abuses and clear violations of human rights. Often media reports and others unearth that it goes on, in many institutions, in the infamous [[Abu Ghraib]] style:&lt;ref name=severity&gt;
{{cite news
| url = http://www.no2ragging.org/ragging.html
| title = The Terror Called Ragging
| publisher = Society Against Violence in Education (SAVE)
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on innocent victims.

However, the Anti-Ragging NGO, [[Society Against Violence in Education]] (SAVE) has supported that ragging is also widely and dangerously prevalent in engineering and other institutions, mainly in the hostels.

Following a Supreme Court Order, a National Anti-Ragging Helpline was created which helps the victims and take action in cases of ragging, by informing the head of the institution and the local police authorities of the ragging complaint from the college. The main feature of the helpline is that the complaints can be registered even without disclosing the name by the victim,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;https://antiragging.in/upload/Infopack/where_can_I_get_help.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; through email at helpline@antiragging.in, or through phone at 1800-180-5522.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://antiragging.in/home.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Ragging Helpline, and anonymous complaints===

India's National Anti-Ragging Helpline started working in June 2009 to help students in distress due to ragging. It consists of an email id and a 24-hour toll-free number. Provision for anonymous complaints was considered of utmost important at the time of establishment of the helpline, since the victim after making the complaint remains with or close to the culprits, away from a fully secure environment. Since many ragging deaths, like Aman Kachroo's,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-11-11/india/28233204_1_aman-kachroo-abhinav-verma-naveen-verma | work=The Times Of India | title=All four accused held guilty of ragging Aman Kachroo to death - The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; occurred due to seniors taking a revenge of the complaint made, anonymous complaints were equally allowed at the helpline.

As per UGC regulations, it is mandatory for a college to register an F.I.R. with police against the culprits if any violence, physical abuse, sexual harassment, confinement etc. takes place with any fresher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugc.ac.in/oldpdf/ragging/gazzetaug2010.pdf |title=UGC Anti-Ragging Regulation &amp;#124; &amp;#124; &amp;#124; See Point 7 |publisher=UGC |date=12 October 2009 |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving any such complaint from the helpline, it becomes the duty of the head of the institution to register the F.I.R. with police within 24 hours. In 2013, a police case was registered against the director, dean and registrar of a reputed college in Delhi for, among other charges, not informing the police and registering F.I.R. within 24 hours of receiving the ragging complaint. (failing to inform a public authority, IPC 176).&lt;ref&gt;http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:gp6NN4z278UJ:www.indianexpress.com/news/naveen-kujur-ragging-case-against-spa-for-negligence-and-tampering-with-evidence/1094641/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=in&amp;lr=lang_en%7Clang_hi&lt;/ref&gt;

The database of the Anti-Ragging Helpline indicates that it has been to an extent successful in ensuring a safer environment in colleges from where it registered the complaints. In many a cases though, it forwarded the complaint to the University Grants Commission (UGC) for an action against those colleges which refused to take any action against the culprits.

====Controversy====
A major concern that was highlighted against the helpline was that it registered a minuscule percentage (0.1%) of the total phone calls it received, and that meant it registered complaint in one out of one thousand calls it received. Specifically, the toll-free helpline (1800-180-5522) received {{formatnum:165297}} calls in the three months of November 2012 to January 2013, hence 77 calls an hour and at least a call a minute. But, only 190 complaints were registered in this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-17/news/37143957_1_nishat-israil-toll-free-helpline-rti-query | work=The Times Of India | title=UGC cell ignores complaints on ragging, registers just 1% - The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its defence, the helpline said that most of the calls it received were of inquiry in nature, of the eager students to know whether the helpline number worked or not. Many a times students changed their minds also midway not to register the complaint.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mid-day.com/news/2012/aug/090812-mumbai-Anti-ragging-helpline-1-6-lakh-dialled-but-only-1400-complained.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It also said that many of the calls were hoaxes as it was a toll-free number.

=== Legislation ===
In 1997, the state of [[Tamil Nadu]] first passed laws related to ragging. Subsequently, a
major boost to anti-ragging efforts was given by a landmark judgement of the [[Supreme Court of India]] in May 2001,&lt;ref name="SC2001Judgement"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927080951/http://www.noragging.com/laws/supreme-court-judgement.html Supreme Court of India Judgement 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; in response to a Public Interest Litigation filed by the Vishwa Jagriti Mission.

The Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD), following a directive by the Supreme court, appointed a seven-member panel headed by ex-[[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] director Dr. R. K. Raghavan to recommend anti-ragging measures.
The Raghavan Committee report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

submitted to the court in May 2007, includes a proposal to include ragging as a special section under the [[Indian Penal Code]]. The Supreme Court of India interim order&lt;ref name=SCMay2007&gt;
{{cite news
| url = http://courtnic.nic.in/supremecourt/temp/sc2429504p.txt
| title = Honbl. Supreme Court interim order on Ragging
| publisher = [[Supreme Court of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (based on the recommendations) dated 16 May 2007 makes it obligatory for academic institutions to file official [[First Information Report]]s with the police in any instance of a complaint of ragging. This would ensure that all cases would be formally investigated under
criminal justice system, and not by the academic institutions own ad-hoc bodies.

The Indian Supreme Court has taken a strong stand to prevent ragging. In 2006, the court directed the H.R.D. Ministry of the Govt. of India to form a panel which will suggest guidelines to control ragging.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The panel, headed by the former director of CBI Dr. R.K.Raghavan, met victims, guardians and others across the country. The Raghavan committee has placed its recommendation to the Hon'ble Supreme Court, which has given its order on the issue.&lt;ref name=SCMay2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

|publisher = [[CNN-IBN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welcoming the Supreme Court's recent judgment on ragging Dr. Raghavan, the former CBI director, who is the chairman, Monitoring Committee for the Prevention of Ragging, said, "there are finally signs that the recommendations to prevent ragging in colleges will be taken seriously."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/05/09/stories/2009050955561100.htm |title = R.K. Raghavan hails verdict &amp;#124 |publisher= Hindu.com |date=9 May 2009 |accessdate= 1 September 2010 |location= Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supreme Court in 2007 directed that all the higher educational institutions should include information about all the ragging incidents in their brochures/prospectus of admission.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ugc.ac.in/soc_crei.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009 UGC Regulation ===

In 2009, in the wake of Aman Kachroo's death, University Grants Commission (UGC) passed UGC regulation on curbing the menace of ragging in higher educational institutions, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iitr.ac.in/news/uploads/File/academic/updatedraggingnotification.pdf{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These regulation mandate every college responsibilities to curb the menace of ragging, including strict pre-emptive measures, like lodging freshers in a separate hostel, surprise raids especially at nights by the anti-ragging squad and submission of affidavits by all senior students and their parents taking oath not to indulge in ragging.

Subsequently, UGC has made few amendments to the Regulation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ugc.ac.in/page/Ragging-Related-Circulars.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; As per these,

# It is no longer required to get the verification of the affidavit done by an oath commissioner.
# The definition of ragging is updated as:
::- "Any act of physical or mental abuse (including bullying and exclusion) targeted at another student (fresher or otherwise) on the ground of colour, race, religion, caste, ethnicity, gender (including transgender), sexual orientation, appearance, nationality, regional origins, linguistic identity, place of birth, place of residence or economic background."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/7823260_Anti-Ragging-3rd-Amendment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-ragging movement ===
With the situation of ragging worsening yearly, there is emerging a spontaneous anti-ragging movement in India. Several voluntary organisations have emerged, who conduct drives for public awareness and arrange for support to victims.

Online groups like [[Coalition to Uproot Ragging from Education]] (CURE), Stopragging, No Ragging Foundation became the major anti-ragging groups on the Internet. Among them, the No Ragging Foundation has transformed into a complete NGO and got registered as [[Society Against Violence in Education]] (SAVE) which is India's first registered anti-ragging nonprofit organisation (NGO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.no2ragging.org/index.html |title=SAVE Homepage |publisher=www.no2ragging.org |date=1 January 1980 |accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org/pt/2007/04/884059.shtml |title=Independent Media Center |publisher=Indymedia.org |date= |accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups are working on issues related to ragging. Each of them is running anti-ragging websites and online groups.

The Indian media has been playing a crucial role by exposing ragging incidents and the indifference of many concerned institutions towards curbing the act. The Supreme Court of India has directed, in its interim judgement, that action may be taken even against negligent institutions.&lt;ref name=SCMay2007/&gt;

==In Sri Lanka==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2017}}
Ragging is widely prevalent in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://noragging.com/index.php/Research/Reports/Ragging-History-and-Evolution.html |title=Ragging: History and Evolution |publisher=[[Coalition to Uproot Ragging from Education]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618204928/http://noragging.com/index.php/Research/Reports/Ragging-History-and-Evolution.html |archive-date=18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2007/07/01/main_Letters.asp |title=Stop murder by ragging! |publisher=[[Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka)]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114193713/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2007/07/01/main_Letters.asp |archive-date=14 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no record to suggest that ragging is an indigenous phenomenon or was present in the ancient Sri Lankan educational institutions such as [[Mahavihara]] or [[Abhayagiri Vihara]]. It is widely considered to have been introduced during the post [[World War II]] era as a result of [[British Ceylon|British colonialism]] in Sri Lanka.{{ref label|a|a|none}} Sri Lankan soldiers returning from war re-entered the college educational system and brought with them the tradition and techniques of military style ragging. These techniques were used in the military as a mechanism of breaking down an individual so that success was achieved through team effort rather than personal goals or motivation. As fewer military persons entered the universities, ragging devolved into a violent and hazardous exercise that has been largely utilized for political purposes and thuggery.{{ref label|a|a|none}}

Ragging continues in most government universities and several private institutions with some efforts being made to contain the problem although there is hesitation from administrations to get involved. These efforts have been largely hindered by students themselves who consider ragging as a rite of passage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamilcanadian.com/page.php?cat=73&amp;id=1550 Indiscipline in Sri Lanka universities]&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of 'safe spaces' and travelling in larger groups are just some techniques employed by a growing movement of students trying to combat ragging. 
Traditionally, ragging would entail seniors mocking or jeering at freshers within a dedicated period of time – usually the first few months of an undergraduates university life. This period is known as the 'ragging period'. In Sri Lanka, several variations of ragging can be observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.lk/2009/06/24/fea02.asp Ragging and ‘teaching sessions’] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714201327/http://www.dailynews.lk/2009/06/24/fea02.asp |date=2009-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adverse consequences===

Ragging has been frequently associated with a broad spectrum of physical, behavioral, emotional and social problems among victims and is attributed to the increased risk of suicide and drop-outs among students attending Sri Lankan universities. Ragging at private universities and higher education institutes are at a minimum as compared to government universities which has prompted many students with financial means to enroll in private establishments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news/2007/2/12522_image_headline.html Anti- Ragging Bill will be strengthen - Wishwa Warnapala]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ragging is not merely a sociolegal problem and has a certain psychological basis too. Many senior students state they do not wish to rag juniors but succumb to peer pressure.

===Major incidents===

*In 1974, ragging of trainee mathematics teachers at the then [[University of Kelaniya|Vidyalankara University]] (now University of Kelaniya) prompted Prime Minister [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]]'s Government to appoint V. W. Kularatne Commission to probe the incident. As a result, 12 undergraduates were expelled and four officials were penalized for their failure to take appropriate action. This was the first major step taken against university ragging by a Sri Lankan government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.island.lk/2002/11/17/news10.html Death of V. W.

===Legal framework===

The human rights of citizens of Sri Lanka are protected in terms of the [[Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka]] which is the supreme law in the country. According to this Constitution, any citizen can produce a petition to the Supreme Court in terms of the article 126 of the Constitution in case of a human right violation or a case closer to the infringement. The Constitution further highlights ruthless, brutal or contemptuous treatment to any party by another as a violation of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2008/06/29/fea01.asp Legal framework on university ragging] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615174822/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2008/06/29/fea01.asp |date=2009-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; University students are also considered as citizens and are subjugated to the Common Law that prevails in the country. Accordingly, the constitutional constrains specified above are equally applicable to university students. Any form of civil or criminal offence executed by them are liable to be punished and in an instance of violation of such rights committed by university students, they shall be produced before the relevant court and subject to suitable punishment that followed by the trial. After the series of ragging-related incidents happened in 1997, ''Prohibition of Ragging and Other Forms of Violence in Educational Institutions Act, No. 20 of 1998''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonlii.org/lk/legis/num_act/poraofovieia20o1998797/ Prohibition Of Ragging And Other Forms Of Violence In Educational Institutions Act, No. 20 of 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; was passed in the Sri Lankan parliament. As specified in the detailed note of the Act, it is identified as an Act to eliminate ragging and other forms of violent and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment from educational institutions. The Act specifies the relevant Higher Educational Institutions coming under the Act and that includes all the Higher Educational Institutions established under the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978.

===Anti-ragging movement===

Unlike in [[India]], there is no official anti-ragging movement in Sri Lanka. But with the situation of ragging worsening yearly, there is a spontaneously emerging anti-ragging movement in each and every faculty of the universities that ragging exists.  In the case of [[University of Peradeniya]], the largest university in Sri Lanka, anti-ragging movement emerged in the year 1996. Prior to that, there was no movement against ragging, but certain individuals managed escape from the ragging. In the mean time, anti-ragging movements started to appear in all other universities. Several faculties in several universities have become rag-free due to these movements, strengthened laws as well as practical difficulties in conducting ragging such as not providing accommodation facilities to the first-year students.  Internal clashes have erupted several times due to the friction between ragging and anti-ragging movements, best example being Samantha Vithanage, a third-year management student at the [[University of Sri Jayewardenepura]], who pioneered an anti-ragging campaign that was killed at a meeting while in a discussion about ragging. The higher education minister at the time, [[S. B. Dissanayake]], stressed that firm action will be taken against those who are found guilty of such activities in future and would be expelled from the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2010/07/18/ragging-to-be-whipped/ Ragging To Be Whipped]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, he claimed that the levels of ragging has gone down drastically in the recent times and "only Peradeniya and Ruhuna are still affected by this 'malaise'".&lt;ref name="damlkn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2011/12/16/news32.asp | title=Ragging in its death throes - SB | publisher=Daily News | date=December 16, 2011 | accessdate=January 2, 2012 | author=Abeyratne, Dharma Sri | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109014819/http://www.dailynews.lk/2011/12/16/news32.asp | archivedate=January 9, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4499">'''Resource justice''' (also referred to as "'''resource equity'''" or "'''resource governance'''") is a term in [[environmentalism]] and in [[environmental ethics]]. It combines elements of [[distributive justice]] and [[climate justice]] and is based on the observation that many countries rich in [[natural resource]]s such as [[mineral]]s and other [[raw material]]s nevertheless experience high levels of poverty. This [[resource curse]] is one of the main ethical reasons to demand resource justice, that is, a globally fair distribution of all natural resources.

== Factors leading to resource injustice ==

[[File:2014 Gini Index World Map, income inequality distribution by country per World Bank.svg|thumb|500px| Countries' income inequality according to their [[Gini coefficient]] – red = high, green = low inequality (World Bank, 2014)]]
The term resource justice as a subcategory of distributive justice was first developed following the repeated observation that natural resources that, supposedly, are a blessing for local populations, turn out to be a curse. This can manifest itself in a number of ways – and for a number of reasons, some of which occur in isolation but more often arise together. Some examples are:
* [[Surface mining|Mining]] or [[Oil well|oil drilling]] result in severe damage to the environment, for example through [[oil spill]]s, [[environmental degradation]], or [[Pollution|contamination]].
* The extraction of resources leads to extreme forms of [[exploitation of labour]] and / or creates very [[Work accident|hazardous working conditions]].
* Resources are being controlled by a small elite that makes or embezzles all the profits. This often goes along with [[corruption]].
* People are forced off their land to make place for resource extraction or for large [[Monoculture|monocultural]] plantations.
* Resources in the developing world are being extracted by companies from industrialised countries, with most of the profits going to the latter.
* Companies extract genetic material, which is then commercially farmed or bred – and often [[Biological patent|patented]].

== Approaches towards greater resource justice ==

[[Capacity building]] and external support in order to empower "communities affected by oil, gas, and mining operations" so that they themselves  are able to determine how local resources are being used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfamamerica.org/take-action/campaign/natural-resource-justice/ Natural Resource Justice], [[Oxfam]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://namati.org/lawyers-for-resource-justice/ Lawyers for Resource Justice]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, mechanisms have to be developed to make sure that finite resources are distributed in an equitable way so that poor nations' right to development is not denied.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books/about/Fair_Future.html?id=_l9U7olOSA0C Wolfgang Sachs, Tilman Santarius, Fair Future: Limited Resources and Global Justice]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The memorandum Resource Politics for a Fair Future, published by the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]] lists three criteria for a "fair and sustainable Resource Politics", namely:
* to "secure the rights of people and nature over markets and profits" and empower them to demand their rights;
* to return the "control over natural resources, financial capital and technologies (...) into the hands of the people;
* to "transform production, consumption and livelihoods" in ways that enable people to live in a world of glbal equity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/resource-politics_for-a-fair_future.pdf Resource Politics for a Fair Future, p.12-13], PDF, Berlin 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rights}}

'''Rights''' are [[law|legal]], social, or [[ethics|ethical]] [[principle]]s of [[Liberty|freedom]] or [[entitlement]]; that is, rights are the fundamental [[normative]] rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory.&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg/&gt; Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as [[law]] and [[ethics]], especially theories of [[justice]] and [[deontology]].
 
Rights are often considered fundamental to [[civilization]], for they are regarded as established pillars of [[society]] and [[culture]],&lt;ref&gt;UN [[UDHR]] Preamble: "Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world..."&lt;/ref&gt; and the history of [[social conflict]]s can be found in the history of each right and its development. According to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', "rights structure the form of [[government]]s, the content of [[laws]], and the shape of [[morality]] as it is currently perceived".&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg/&gt;

==Definitional issues==
[[File:RNC 04 protest 89.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Street protest scene; people deliberately lying down on a busy city street, surrounded by onlookers and police|Rights are widely regarded as the basis of law, but what if laws are bad? Some theorists suggest [[civil disobedience]] is, itself, a ''right'', and it was advocated by thinkers such as [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]].]]
There is considerable disagreement about what is meant precisely by the term ''rights''. It has been used by different groups and thinkers for different purposes, with different and sometimes opposing definitions, and the precise definition of this principle, beyond having something to do with normative rules of some sort or another, is controversial.

One way to get an idea of the multiple understandings and senses of the term is to consider different ways it is used. Many diverse things are claimed as rights: {{cquote|A right to life, a right to choose; a right to vote, to work, to strike; a right to one phone call, to dissolve parliament, to operate a forklift, to asylum, to equal treatment before the law, to feel proud of what one has done; a right to exist, to sentence an offender to death, to launch a nuclear first strike, to carry a concealed weapon, to a distinct genetic identity; a right to believe one's own eyes, to pronounce the couple husband and wife, to be left alone, to go to hell in one's own way.&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg&gt;{{cite news
|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
|quote = Rights dominate most modern understandings of what actions are proper and which institutions are just. Rights structure the forms of our governments, the contents of our laws, and the shape of morality as we perceive it. To accept a set of rights is to approve a distribution of freedom and authority, and so to endorse a certain view of what may, must, and must not be done.
|publisher = ''Stanford University''
|date = July 9, 2007
|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/
|accessdate = 2009-12-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are likewise diverse possible ways to categorize rights, such as:
{{cquote|''Who'' is alleged to have the right: Children's rights, animal rights, workers' rights, states' rights, the rights of peoples. ''What actions or states or objects'' the asserted right pertains to: Rights of free expression, to pass judgment; rights of privacy, to remain silent; property rights, bodily rights. ''Why'' the rightholder (allegedly) has the right: Moral rights spring from moral reasons, legal rights derive from the laws of the society, customary rights are aspects of local customs. ''How the asserted right can be affected'' by the rightholder's actions: The inalienable right to life, the forfeitable right to liberty, and the waivable right that a promise be kept.&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg/&gt;}}
There has been considerable debate about what this term means within the academic community, particularly within fields such as [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[deontology]], [[logic]], [[political science]], and [[religion]].

===Natural versus legal===
[[File:Brueghel Jan II God creating.jpg|thumb|right|alt=painting of dark gray skies with trees and water, and a human image, flying, with arms outstretched|According to some views, certain rights derive from [[deities]] or [[nature]]]]
{{Main|Natural and legal rights}}
* '''Natural rights''' are rights which are "natural" in the sense of "not artificial, not man-made", as in rights deriving from [[human nature]] or from the [[divine command theory|edicts of a god]]. They are universal; that is, they apply to all people, and do not derive from the laws of any specific society. They exist necessarily, inhere in every individual, and can't be taken away. For example, it has been argued that humans have a natural ''right to life''. These are sometimes called ''[[natural and legal rights|moral rights]]'' or ''inalienable rights''.
* '''Legal rights''', in contrast, are based on a society's customs, laws, [[statute]]s or actions by [[legislature]]s. An example of a legal right is the ''right to vote'' of citizens. [[Citizenship]], itself, is often considered as the basis for having legal rights, and has been defined as the "right to have rights". Legal rights are sometimes called ''[[civil rights]]'' or ''statutory rights'' and are culturally and politically [[moral relativism|relative]] since they depend on a specific societal context to have meaning.

Some thinkers see rights in only one sense while others accept that both senses have a measure of validity. There has been considerable philosophical debate about these senses throughout history. For example, [[Jeremy Bentham]] believed that legal rights were the essence of rights, and he denied the existence of natural rights; whereas [[Thomas Aquinas]] held that rights purported by [[positive law]] but not grounded in [[natural law]] were not properly rights at all, but only a facade or pretense of rights.

===Claim versus liberty===
[[File:Chorin deed 1273.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a deed which has hand-written writing on a yellowed piece of paper with three gold tassles at the bottom|A [[deed]] is an example of a ''claim right'' in the sense that it asserts a ''right'' to own land. This particular deed dates back to 1273.]]
{{Main|Claim rights and liberty rights}}
* A '''claim right''' is a right which entails that another person has a duty to the right-holder. Somebody else must do or refrain from doing something to or for the ''claim holder'', such as perform a service or supply a product for him or her; that is, he or she has a ''claim'' to that service or product (another term is ''[[thing in action]]'').&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;Fagan, Andrew. "Human Rights". ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-rts/#SH3b&lt;/ref&gt; In logic, this idea can be expressed as: "Person ''A'' has a claim that person ''B'' do something if and only if ''B'' has a duty to ''A'' to do that something." Every claim-right entails that some other duty-bearer must do some duty for the claim to be satisfied. This duty can be to act or to refrain from acting. For example, many jurisdictions recognize broad claim rights to things like "life, liberty, and property"; these rights impose an obligation upon others ''not'' to assault or restrain a person, or use their property, without the claim-holder's permission. Likewise, in jurisdictions where social welfare services are provided, citizens have legal claim rights to be provided with those services.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* A '''liberty right''' or ''privilege'', in contrast, is simply a freedom or permission for the right-holder to do something, and there are ''no obligations'' on other parties to do or not do anything.&lt;ref name="IEP" /&gt; This can be expressed in logic as: "Person ''A'' has a privilege to do something if and only if ''A'' has no duty not to do that something." For example, if a person has a legal liberty right to free speech, that merely means that it is not legally forbidden for them to speak freely: it does ''not'' mean that anyone has to help enable their speech, or to listen to their speech; or even, per se, refrain from stopping them from speaking, though ''other'' rights, such as the claim right to be free from assault, may severely limit what others can do to stop them.

Liberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so. Likewise, if a person has a claim right against someone else, then that other person's liberty is limited. For example, a person has a ''liberty right'' to walk down a sidewalk and can decide freely whether or not to do so, since there is no obligation either to do so or to refrain from doing so. But pedestrians may have an obligation not to walk on certain lands, such as other people's private property, to which those other people have a claim right. So a person's ''liberty right'' of walking extends precisely to the point where another's ''claim right'' limits his or her freedom.

===Positive versus negative===
{{Main|Negative and positive rights}}
In one sense, a right is a permission to do something or an entitlement to a specific service or treatment from others, and these rights have been called ''positive rights''. However, in another sense, rights may allow or require inaction, and these are called ''negative rights''; they permit or require doing nothing. For example, in some countries, e.g. the [[United States]], citizens have the ''positive right'' to vote and they have the ''negative right'' to not vote; people can choose not to vote in a given election without punishment. In other countries, e.g. [[Australia]], however, citizens have a positive right to vote but they don't have a negative right to not vote, since [[compulsory voting|voting is compulsory]]. Accordingly:
* '''Positive rights''' are permissions to do things, or entitlements to be done unto. One example of a positive right is the purported "right to welfare."&lt;ref name=tws21decgkfjf/&gt;
* '''Negative rights''' are permissions not to do things, or entitlements to be left alone. Often the distinction is invoked by [[libertarianism|libertarians]] who think of a ''negative right'' as an entitlement to non-interference such as a right against being assaulted.&lt;ref name=tws21decgkfjf&gt;{{cite news
|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
|quote = A distinction between negative and positive rights is popular among some normative theorists, especially those with a bent toward libertarianism. The holder of a negative right is entitled to non-interference, while the holder of a positive right is entitled to provision of some good or service. A right against assault is a classic example of a negative right, while a right to welfare assistance is a prototypical positive right.
|publisher = ''Stanford University''
|date = July 9, 2007
|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/
|accessdate = 2009-12-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though similarly named, positive and negative rights should not be confused with ''active rights'' (which encompass "privileges" and "powers") and ''passive rights'' (which encompass "claims" and "immunities").

===Individual versus group===
{{Main|Individual and group rights}}
The general concept of rights is that they are possessed by individuals in the sense that they are permissions and entitlements to do things which other persons, or which governments or authorities, can not infringe. This is the understanding of people such as the author [[Ayn Rand]] who argued that only individuals have rights, according to her philosophy known as [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].&lt;ref name=tws18decafafa&gt;{{cite news
|author = Ayn Rand
|title = The Virtue of Selfishness: Individual Rights
|quote = Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the individual). see page 104. See also: [[Group rights#Objectivist view|Collectivized 'Rights]]
|publisher = ''The Ayn Rand Lexicon''
|date = 2009-12-18
|url = http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html
|accessdate = 2009-12-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have argued that there are situations in which a group of persons is thought to have rights, or ''group rights''. Accordingly:
* '''Individual rights''' are rights held by individual people regardless of their group membership or lack thereof.
[[File:Malian Soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Soldiers lined up in a row, with green caps, carrying rifles|Do groups have ''rights''? Some argue that when soldiers bond in [[combat]], the group becomes like an organism in itself and has ''rights'' which trump the rights of any individual soldier.]]
* '''Group rights''' have been argued to exist when a group is seen as more than a mere composite or assembly of separate individuals but an entity in its own right. In other words, it's possible to see a group as a distinct being in and of itself; it's akin to an enlarged individual, a corporate body, which has a distinct will and power of action and can be thought of as having ''rights''. For example, a platoon of soldiers in [[combat]] can be thought of as a distinct group, since individual members are willing to risk their lives for the survival of the group, and therefore the group can be conceived as having a "right" which is superior to that of any individual member; for example, a soldier who disobeys an officer can be punished, perhaps even killed, for a breach of obedience.  But there is another sense of group rights in which people who are members of a group can be thought of as having specific individual rights because of their membership in a group. In this sense, the set of rights which individuals-as-group-members have is expanded because of their membership in a group. For example, workers who are members of a group such as a [[Trade union|labor union]] can be thought of as having expanded individual rights because of their membership in the labor union, such as the rights to specific working conditions or wages. As expected, there is sometimes considerable disagreement about what exactly is meant by the term "group" as well as by the term "group rights."{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

There can be tension between individual and group rights. A classic instance in which group and individual rights clash is conflicts between unions and their members. For example, individual members of a union may wish a wage higher than the union-negotiated wage, but are prevented from making further requests; in a so-called [[closed shop]] which has a [[union security agreement]], only the union has a ''right'' to decide matters for the individual union members such as wage rates. So, do the supposed "individual rights" of the workers prevail about the proper wage? Or do the "group rights" of the union regarding the proper wage prevail? Clearly this is a source of tension.

The [[Austrian School|Austrian School of Economics]] holds that only individuals think, feel, and act whether or not members of any abstract group. The society should thus according to economists of the school be analyzed starting from the individual. This methodology is called [[methodological individualism]] and is used by the economists to justify [[individual rights]].

===Other senses===
Other distinctions between rights draw more on historical association or [[family resemblance]] than on precise philosophical distinctions. These include the distinction between '''[[civil and political rights]]''' and '''[[economic, social and cultural rights]]''', between which the articles of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] are often divided. Another conception of rights groups them into '''[[three generations of human rights|three generations]]'''. These distinctions have much overlap with that between [[negative and positive rights]], as well as between [[individual rights]] and [[group rights]], but these groupings are not entirely coextensive.

==Politics==
[[File:Man being arrested.jpg|thumb|right|alt=three police officers surround a man in a tee shirt who is handcuffed|In the [[United States]], persons who are going to be questioned by police when they are in police custody must be read their "Miranda rights". The [[Miranda warning]] requires police officers to read a statement to people being arrested which informs them that they have certain rights, such as the right to remain silent and the right to have an attorney.]]
Rights are often included in the foundational questions that governments and politics have been designed to deal with. Often the development of these socio-political institutions have formed a dialectical relationship with rights.

Rights about particular issues, or the rights of particular groups, are often areas of special concern. Often these concerns arise when rights come into conflict with other legal or moral issues, sometimes even other rights.  Issues of concern have historically included [[labor rights]], [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights]], [[reproductive rights]], [[disability rights]], [[patient rights]] and [[prisoners' rights]].  With increasing [[mass surveillance|monitoring]] and the information society, [[digital rights|information rights]], such as the [[right to privacy]] are becoming more important.

Some examples of groups whose rights are of particular concern include [[animal rights|animals]],&lt;ref name=tws21decghnnb&gt;{{cite news

Accordingly, politics plays an important role in developing or recognizing the above rights, and the discussion about which behaviors are included as "rights" is an ongoing political topic of importance. The concept of rights varies with political orientation. Positive rights such as a "right to medical care" are emphasized more often by left-leaning thinkers, while right-leaning thinkers place more emphasis on negative rights such as the "right to a fair trial".

Further, the term ''equality'' which is often bound up with the meaning of "rights" often depends on one's political orientation. [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and advocates of [[free markets]] often identify equality with [[equality of opportunity]], and want equal and fair rules in the process of making things, while agreeing that sometimes these fair rules lead to unequal outcomes. In contrast, [[socialism|socialists]] often identify equality with [[equality of outcome]] and see fairness when people have equal amounts of goods and services, and therefore think that people have a right to equal portions of necessities such as [[health care]] or [[Welfare|economic assistance]] or [[House|housing]].&lt;ref name=tws21dece563e&gt;{{cite news

|title = Roemer on equality of opportunity
|quote = Equality of opportunity is to be contrasted with equality of outcome. While advocacy of the latter has been traditionally associated with a left-wing political philosophy, the former has been championed by conservative political philosophy. Equality of outcome fails to hold individuals responsible for imprudent actions that may, absent redress, reduce the values of the outcomes they enjoy, or for wise actions that would raise the value of the outcomes above the levels of others’. Equality of opportunity, in contrast, ‘levels the playing field,’ so that all have the potential to achieve the same outcomes; whether or not, in the event, they do, depends upon individual choice.

==Philosophy==
In [[philosophy]], [[meta-ethics]] is the branch of ethics that seeks to understand the nature of ethical [[property (philosophy)|properties]], statements, attitudes, and judgments. Meta-ethics is one of the three branches of ethics generally recognized by philosophers, the others being [[normative ethics]] and [[applied ethics]].

While normative ethics addresses such questions as "What should one do?", thus endorsing some ethical evaluations and rejecting others, meta-ethics addresses questions such as "What ''is'' goodness?" and "How can we tell what is good from what is bad?", seeking to understand the nature of ethical properties and evaluations.

Rights ethics is an answer to the meta-ethical question of ''what normative ethics is concerned with'' (Meta-ethics also includes a group of questions about how ethics comes to be known, true, etc. which is not directly addressed by rights ethics).
Rights ethics holds that normative ethics is concerned with rights. Alternative meta-ethical theories are that ethics is concerned with one of the following:
* Duties ([[deontology]])
* [[Value (ethics)|Value]] ([[axiology]])
* Virtue ([[virtue ethics]])
* Consequences ([[consequentialism]], e.g. [[utilitarianism]])

Rights ethics has had considerable influence on political and social thinking. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] gives some concrete examples of widely accepted rights.

===Criticism===
Some philosophers have criticised rights as [[ontologically]] dubious entities.  For instance, although in favour of the extension of [[individual rights|individual legal rights]], the [[utilitarian]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] opposed the idea of [[natural law]] and [[natural rights]], calling them "nonsense upon stilts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Ross |chapterurl=http://www.utilitarian.net/bentham/about/1995----.htm |chapter=Jeremy Bentham |editor-last=Honderich |editor-first=Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |pages=85–88 }} Also see {{cite web |last=Sweet |first=William |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/b/bentham.htm |title=Jeremy Bentham |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=7 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, one can question the ability of rights to actually bring about justice for all.

==Etymology==
[[File:Beowulf - rihte.jpg|thumb|"rihte," an Old English word for 'right']]
The [[Modern English]] word ''right'' derives from [[Old English]] ''riht'' or ''reht'', in turn from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*riχtaz'' meaning "right" or "direct", and ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*reg-to-'' meaning "having moved in a straight line", in turn from ''*(o)reg'(a)-'' meaning "to straighten or direct".&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:right]]&lt;/ref&gt; In several different [[Indo-European languages]], a single word derived from the same root means both "right" and "law", such as French ''droit'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:droit]]&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish ''derecho'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:derecho]]&lt;/ref&gt; German ''Recht'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:recht]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Italian ''diritto''.

Many other words related to normative or regulatory concepts derive from this same root, including ''correct'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:correct]]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''regulate'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:regulate]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''rex''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:rex#latin]]&lt;/ref&gt; (meaning "king"), whence ''regal''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:regal]]&lt;/ref&gt; and thence ''royal''.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:royal]]&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise many more geometric terms derive from this same root, such as ''erect'' (as in "upright"),&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:erect]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''rectangle'' (literally "[[right angle]]"),&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:rectangle]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''straight''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:straight]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''stretch''.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:stretch]]&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''right'', the English words ''rule''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:rule]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ruler'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ruler]]&lt;/ref&gt; deriving still from the same root, have both normative or regulatory and geometric meanings (e.g. a ruler as in a king, or a ruler as in a straightedge).

Several other roots have similar normative and geometric descendants, such as Latin ''norma'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:norma#latin]]&lt;/ref&gt; whence ''[[norm (philosophy)|norm]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:norm]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''normal'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:normal]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''normative''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:normative]]&lt;/ref&gt; itself, and also geometric concepts such as ''[[Normal (geometry)|normal vectors]]''; and likewise Greek ''ortho''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ortho]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin ''ordo'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ordo]]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning either "right" or "correct" (as in ''orthodox'', meaning "correct opinion"&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:orthodox]]&lt;/ref&gt;) or "straight" or "perpendicular" (as in ''orthogonal'', meaning "perpendicular angle"&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:orthogonal]]&lt;/ref&gt;), and thence ''order'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:order]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''ordinary'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ordinary]]&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

==History==
{{see also|History of human rights}}
[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Magna Carta]]'' or "Great Charter" was one of England's first documents containing commitments by a [[monarch|king]] to his people to respect certain [[law|legal]] rights. It reduced the power of the monarch.]]

[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a painting; the painting is of a written declaration; there are two human images to the left and right; it says "Declaration des droits de l'homme" (declaration of the rights of man)|The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in 1789 in [[France]].]]

The specific enumeration of rights has differed greatly in different periods of history. In many cases, the system of rights promulgated by one group has come into sharp and bitter conflict with that of other groups. In the political sphere, a place in which rights have historically been an important issue, constitutional provisions of various states sometimes address the question of who has what legal rights.

Historically, many notions of rights were [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[hierarchy|hierarchical]], with different people granted different rights, and some having more rights than others. For instance, the right of a father to respected from his son did not indicate a right from the son to receive a return from that respect; and the [[divine right of kings]], which permitted absolute power over subjects, did not leave a lot of room for many rights for the subjects themselves.&lt;ref name=tws21decfrre&gt;{{cite news

In contrast, modern conceptions of rights have often emphasized [[liberty]] and [[egalitarianism|equality]] as among the most important aspects of rights, as was evident in the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution|French]] revolutions.

{{Refimprove|date=October 2014}}

'''Siddhānta''', a [[Sanskrit]] term denoting the established and accepted view of any particular school within [[Indian philosophy]]. Literally "settled opinion or doctrine, dogma, axiom, received or admitted truth; any fixed or established or canonical text-book on any subject" (&lt; siddha, adj. mfn.- accomplished, fulfilled; that has attained the highest object, thoroughly skilled or versed in).&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/prem/mw/s.html Monier-Williams Sanskrit Dictionary sv. "siddhanta"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindu philosophy==
This term is an established term within [[Hindu philosophy]] which denotes a specific line of development within a [[Hindu]] religious or philosophical tradition. The traditional schools of Hindu philosophy have had their siddhantas established by their respective founders in the form of [[Sutra]]s (aphorisms). The Sutras are commented by a major philosopher in the respective traditions to elaborate upon the established doctrine by quoting from [[Hindu scriptures|the ''shastras'']] (scriptures) and using logic and [[pramana]]s (accepted source of knowledge). For example, in the tradition of [[Vedanta]], the author of the [[Brahma Sutra]] was [[Vyasa|Veda Vyasa]] and the commentators were [[Adi Shankara]], [[Ramanuja]] and [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]] (each of whom eventually set up sub-schools within Vedanta). Also, in the tradition of [[mimamsa|Purva Mimamsa]], the author of the Sutra was [[Jaimini]] and the commentator was [[Shabaraswami]].

==Buddhist philosophy==
[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] scholars translate the term accurately as 'tenet'. In Tibetan Scholar Konchog Jigmed Wangpo's famous text on philosophical tenets, he writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;The etymology for 'tenet' (''siddhanta'') is: a tenet or a meaning which was made firm, decided upon, or established in reliance on the texts and reasoning and which will not be forsaken for something else. Dharmamitra's ''Clear Words'', ''A Commentary on Maitreya's Ornament for Realisations'' (''abhisamayalamkara karika prajnaparamita mitopadesha shastratike'') says: '"Established conclusion [''siddhanta''] signifies one's own established assertion which is thoroughly borne out by the texts and reasoning. Because one will not pass beyond this assertion, it is a conclusion."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Jain philosophycal studies==
For [[Jainism]], [[Jain Agamas|the texts]] vary between the three primary sects, with [[Sthanakavasis]] believing in no textual authority. Both the [[Digambara]] and [[Shvetambara]] believe that the "purest" Jain teachings were contained within the ''[[Purvas]]'', which have been mostly lost to antiquity. Of the surviving Jain scriptures, the Digambara tend to focus upon the '''Prakaranas'''; while the Shvetambara focus upon the '''Angas'''.

==Astronomy==
Early [[Indian astronomy]] is transmitted in ''Siddhanta''s: [[Varahamihira]] (6th century) in his ''[[Pancha-Siddhantika]]'' contrasts five of these: The [[Surya Siddhanta]] besides the [[Paitamaha Siddhanta]]s (which is more similar to the "classical" [[Vedanga Jyotisha]]), the [[Paulisha Siddhanta|Paulisha]] and  [[Romaka Siddhanta|Romaka]] Siddhantas (directly based on Hellenistic astronomy) and the  [[Vasishtha Siddhanta]].

'''Stevens's power law''' is an empirical relationship in [[psychophysics]] between an increased intensity or strength in a physical stimulus and the perceived [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] increase in the sensation created by the stimulus. It is often considered to supersede the [[Weber–Fechner law]], based on a logarithmic relationship between stimulus and sensation, because the power law describes a wider range of sensory comparisons.

The theory is named after psychophysicist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] (1906–1973).  Although the idea of a [[power law]] had been suggested by 19th-century researchers, Stevens is credited with reviving the law and publishing a body of psychophysical data to support it in 1957.

The general form of the law is
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(I) = k I ^a,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''I'' is the intensity or strength of the stimulus in physical units (energy, weight, pressure, mixture proportions, etc.), ψ(''I'') is the magnitude of the sensation evoked by the stimulus, ''a'' is an exponent that depends on the type of stimulation or sensory modality, and ''k'' is a [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] constant that depends on the units used.

A distinction has been made between local [[psychophysics]], where stimuli can only be discriminated with a probability around 50%, and global psychophysics, where the stimuli can be discriminated correctly with near certainty ([[R. Duncan Luce|Luce]] &amp; Krumhansl, 1988). The Weber–Fechner law and methods described by [[L. L. Thurstone]] are generally applied in local psychophysics, whereas Stevens's methods are usually applied in global psychophysics.

The table to the right lists the exponents reported by Stevens.

==Methods==
The principal methods used by Stevens to measure the perceived intensity of a stimulus were ''magnitude estimation'' and ''magnitude production''. In magnitude estimation with a standard, the experimenter presents a stimulus called a ''standard'' and assigns it a number called the ''modulus''. For subsequent stimuli, subjects report numerically their perceived intensity relative to the standard so as to preserve the ratio between the sensations and the numerical estimates (e.g., a sound perceived twice as loud as the standard should be given a number twice the modulus). In magnitude estimation without a standard (usually just ''magnitude estimation''), subjects are free to choose their own standard, assigning any number to the first stimulus and all subsequent ones with the only requirement being that the ratio between sensations and numbers is preserved. In magnitude production a number and a reference stimulus is given and subjects produce a stimulus that is perceived as that number times the reference. Also used is ''cross-modality matching'', which generally involves subjects altering the magnitude of one physical quantity, such as the brightness of a light, so that its perceived intensity is equal to the perceived intensity of another type of quantity, such as warmth or pressure.

==Criticisms==
Stevens generally collected magnitude estimation data from multiple observers, averaged the data across subjects, and then fitted a power function to the data.  Because the fit was generally reasonable, he concluded the power law was correct.

A principal criticism has been that Stevens's approach provides neither a direct test of the power law itself nor the underlying assumptions of the magnitude estimation/production method: it simply fits curves to data points. In addition, the power law can be deduced mathematically from the Weber-Fechner logarithmic function ([[Mackay, 1963]]&lt;ref&gt;MacKay, D. M. Psychophysics of perceived intensity: A theoretical basis for Fechner's and Stevens' laws. Science, 1963, 139, 1213-1216.&lt;/ref&gt;), and the relation makes predictions consistent with data ([http://hdl.handle.net/10161/6003 Staddon], 1978&lt;ref&gt;Staddon, J. E. R.)].  Theory of behavioral power functions. Psychological Review, 85, 305-320. &lt;/ref&gt;). As with all psychometric studies, Stevens's approach ignores individual differences in the stimulus-sensation relationship, and there are generally large individual differences in this relationship that averaging the data will obscure {{Harv|Green|Luce|1974}}.

Stevens's main assertion was that using magnitude estimations/productions respondents were able to make judgements on a [[Scale (ratio)|ratio scale]] (i.e., if ''x'' and ''y'' are values on a given ratio scale, then there exists a constant ''k'' such that ''x'' = ''ky''). In the context of [[axiomatic system|axiomatic]] psychophysics, {{harv|Narens|1996}} formulated a testable property capturing the implicit underlying assumption this assertion entailed. Specifically, for two proportions ''p'' and ''q'', and three stimuli, ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', if ''y'' is judged ''p'' times ''x'', ''z'' is judged ''q'' times ''y'', then ''t'' = ''pq'' times ''x'' should be equal to ''z''. This amounts to assuming that respondents interpret numbers in a veridical way. This property was unambiguously rejected ({{harvnb|Ellermeier|Faulhammer|2000}}, {{harvnb|Zimmer|2005}}). Without assuming veridical interpretation of numbers, {{Harv|Narens|1996}} formulated another property that, if sustained, meant that respondents could make ratio scaled judgments, namely, if ''y'' is judged ''p'' times ''x'', ''z'' is judged ''q'' times ''y'', and if ''y''{{'}} is judged ''q'' times ''x'', ''z''{{'}} is judged ''p'' times ''y''{{'}}, then ''z'' should equal ''z''{{'}}. This property has been sustained in a variety of situations ({{Harvnb|Ellermeier|Faulhammer|2000}}, {{harvnb|Zimmer|2005}}).

Critics of the power law also point out that the validity of the law is contingent on the measurement of perceived stimulus intensity that is employed in the relevant experiments. {{harv|Luce|2002}}, under the condition that respondents' numerical distortion function and the psychophysical functions could be separated, formulated a behavioral condition equivalent to the psychophysical function being a power function. This condition was confirmed for just over half the respondents, and the power form was found to be a reasonable approximation for the rest {{Harv|Steingrimsson|Luce|2006}}.

It has also been questioned, particularly in terms of [[signal detection theory]], whether any given stimulus is actually associated with a particular and ''absolute'' perceived intensity; i.e. one that is independent of contextual factors and conditions. Consistent with this, Luce (1990, p.&amp;nbsp;73) observed that "by introducing contexts such as background noise in loudness judgements, the shape of the magnitude estimation functions certainly deviates sharply from a power function". Indeed, nearly all sensory judgments can be changed by the context in which a stimulus is perceived.

[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 020221-D-9880W-080.jpg|thumb|right|Rumsfeld during a [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] [[News conference|news briefing]] in February 2002.]]

"'''There are known knowns'''" is a phrase from a response [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] gave to a question at a [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) [[News conference|news briefing]] on February 12, 2002 about the lack of [[evidence]] linking the government of [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] with the supply of [[weapons of mass destruction]] to [[terrorist groups]].&lt;ref name="defense.gov-transcript"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=2636 |title=Defense.gov News Transcript: DoD News Briefing – Secretary Rumsfeld and Gen. Myers, United States Department of Defense (defense.gov) |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumsfeld stated:
{{quote|Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns – the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones.&lt;ref name="defense.gov-transcript"/&gt;}}

The statement became the subject of much commentary, including a [[The Unknown Known|documentary]] by [[Academy Award]]–winning [[film director]] [[Errol Morris]].&lt;ref name="GirardGirard2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Girard|first1=John|last2=Girard|first2=JoAnn|title=A Leader's Guide to Knowledge Management: Drawing on the Past to Enhance Future Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vqnTceVAjsUC&amp;pg=PA55|accessdate=February 10, 2014|date=June 1, 2009 |publisher=Business Expert Press|isbn=9781606490198|pages=55–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Rumsfeld's statement brought much fame and public attention to the concepts of known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns, but national security and intelligence professionals have long used an analysis technique referred to as the [[Johari window]]. The idea of unknown unknowns was created in 1955 by two American [[psychologist]]s, Joseph Luft (1916–2014) and Harrington Ingham (1916–1995) in their development of the Johari window. They used it as a technique to help people better understand their relationship with themselves as well as others.

The term was also commonly used inside [[NASA]]. Rumsfeld himself cited [[NASA administrator]] [[William Robert Graham|William Graham]] in his memoir; he wrote that he had first heard "a variant of the phrase" from Graham when they served together on the [[Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States]] during the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="Rumsfeld1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rumsfeld|first1=Donald|title=Known and Unknown: A Memoir|date=2011|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|isbn=9781101502495|page=xiv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_wIcpxMOjD4C&amp;pg=PT15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirk Borne, an [[astrophysicist]] who was employed as a [[data scientist]] at [[NASA Goddard Space Flight Center]] at the time, noted in an April 2013 TED talk that he had used the phrase "unknown unknowns" in a talk to personnel at the Homeland Security Transition Planning Office a few days prior to Rumsfeld's remarks, and speculated that the term may have percolated up to Rumsfeld and other high-ranking officials in the defense department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Data, Small World: Kirk Borne at TEDxGeorgeMasonU|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr02fMBfuRA|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "known unknowns" and "unknown unknowns" are often used in [[project management]] and [[strategic planning]]&lt;ref&gt;https://hbr.org/1997/11/strategy-under-uncertainty&lt;/ref&gt; circles.

Known unknowns refers to "risks you are aware of, such as cancelled flights...."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lynda.com/Business-Skills-tutorials/Identifying-risks/80780/95069-4.html|title = Project Management Fundamentals|date = December 14, 2011|accessdate = October 17, 2015|website = Lynda.com|publisher = Lynda.com/LinkedIN|last = Biafore|first = Bonnie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unknown unknowns are risks that come from situations that are so unexpected that they would not be considered. "For example, prior to the invention of the personal computer, manufacturers of typewriters probably didn't foresee the risks to their business".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lynda.com/Business-Skills-tutorials/Identifying-risks/80780/95069-4.html|title = Product Management Fundamentals|date = December 14, 2011|accessdate = October 17, 2015|website = Lynda.com|publisher = Lynda.com/LinkedIN|last = Biafore|first = Bonnie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary usage is largely consistent with the earliest known usages. For example, the term was used in evidence given to the British Columbia Royal Commission of Inquiry into Uranium Mining in 1979:

{{quote|Site conditions always pose unknowns, or uncertainties, which may become known during construction or operation to the detriment of the facility and possibly lead to damage of the environment or endanger public health and safety. The risk posed by unknowns is somewhat dependent on the nature of the unknown relative to past experience. This has led me classify unknowns into one of the following two types: 1. known unknowns (expected or foreseeable conditions), which can be reasonably anticipated but not quantified based on past experience as exemplified by case histories (in Appendix A and 2). Unknown unknowns (unexpected or unforeseeable conditions), which pose a potentially greater risk simply because they cannot be anticipated based on past experience or investigation.

—

Known unknowns result from phenomena which are recognized, but poorly understood. On the other hand, unknown unknowns are phenomena which cannot be expected because there has been no prior experience or theoretical basis for expecting the phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.empr.gov.bc.ca/Mining/Geoscience/PublicationsCatalogue/Papers/Pages/1980-7.aspx &lt;!-- this maybe the document, see page 2 subtitle 'Phase V Waste Disposal' but seems not to cite actual 'Statement' --&gt; |title= Statement of Evidence of E.

The term also appeared in a 1982 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article on the [[aerospace industry]], which cites the example of [[metal fatigue]], the cause of crashes in [[de Havilland Comet]] [[airliner]]s in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Newhouse |first= J. |date= June 14, 1982 |title= A reporter at large: a sporty game; 1-betting the company |work= New Yorker |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1982/06/14/a-sporty-game-i-betting-the-company |pages= 48–105}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==

While the remarks initially led to some ridicule towards the Bush administration in general and Rumsfeld in particular, over time the consensus regarding it has shifted over the years and it now enjoys some level of respect. For example, Rumsfeld's defenders have included [[Canadians|Canadian]] columnist [[Mark Steyn]], who called it "in fact a brilliant distillation of quite a complex matter",&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |author=Steyn, Mark |authorlink=Mark Steyn |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3599959/Rummy-speaks-the-truth-not-gobbledygook.html |title=Rummy speaks the truth, not gobbledygook |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=December 9, 2003 |accessdate=October 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australian economist and [[blog]]ger [[John Quiggin]], who wrote, "Although the language may be tortured, the basic point is both valid and important."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Quiggin, John |authorlink=John Quiggin |url=http://johnquiggin.com/index.php/archives/2004/02/10/in-defense-of-rumsfeld/ |title=In Defense of Rumsfeld |date=February 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychoanalytic philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]] says that beyond these three categories there is a fourth, the unknown known, that which we intentionally refuse to acknowledge that we know: "If Rumsfeld thinks that the main dangers in the confrontation with Iraq were the 'unknown unknowns', that is, the threats from Saddam whose nature we cannot even suspect, then the Abu Ghraib scandal shows that the main dangers lie in the "unknown knowns"—the disavowed beliefs, suppositions and obscene practices we pretend not to know about, even though they form the background of our public values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lacan.com/zizekrumsfeld.htm |title=What Rumsfeld Doesn't Know That He Knows About Abu Ghraib |accessdate=February 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German sociologists Daase and Kessler (2007) agree with a basic point of Rumsfeld in stating that the [[framing (sociology)|cognitive frame]] for political practice may be determined by the relationship between ''what we know, what we do not know, what we cannot know'', but Rumsfeld left out ''what we do not like to know''.&lt;ref name=kauk&gt;Knowns and Unknowns in the 'War on Terror': Uncertainty and the Political Construction of Danger, Christopher Daase and Oliver Kessler, Security Dialogue, December 2007; vol. 38, 4: pp. 411–434.&lt;/ref&gt;

The event has been used in multiple books to discuss [[risk assessment]].&lt;ref name="GirardGirard2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NeveLuetchford2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neve|first1=Geert de|last2=Luetchford|first2=Peter|title=Hidden Hands in the Market: Ethnographies of Fair Trade, Ethical Consumption, and Corporate Social Responsibility|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1iYFfhhm8cC&amp;pg=PA252|accessdate=February 10, 2014|year=2008|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=9781848550582|pages=252–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumsfeld named his autobiography ''[[Known and Unknown: A Memoir]]''. In an "Author's Note" at the start of the book, he expressly acknowledged the source of his memoir's title and mentioned a few examples of his statement's prominence, including this Wikipedia article.&lt;ref name="Rumsfeld2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rumsfeld|first1=Donald|title=Known and Unknown: A Memoir|date=2011|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|isbn=9781101502495|page=xiii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_wIcpxMOjD4C&amp;pg=PT14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Unknown Known]]'' is the title of [[Errol Morris]]'s 2013 biographical documentary about Rumsfeld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Scott|title=Not Giving an Inch in a Battle of Wits and Words; Deciphering Donald H.

==Analytical sciences==
The term "known unknowns" has been applied to the identification of chemical substances using analytical chemistry approaches, specifically mass spectrometry. In many cases, an unknown to an investigator that is detected in an experiment is actually known in the chemical literature, a reference database, or an internet resource. These types of compounds are termed "known unknowns". The term was originally coined by Little et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Little | first1 = J.L. | last2 = Cleven | first2 = C.D. | last3 = Brown | first3 = S.D. | year = 2011 | title = Identification of "Known Unknowns" utilizing accurate mass data and chemical abstracts service databases | url = | journal = J.

The '''Tocharian alphabet''' is a version of [[Brahmi script]] used to write the Central Asian Indo-European [[Tocharian languages]], mostly from the 8th century (with a few earlier ones) that were written on palm leaves, wooden tablets and Chinese [[paper]], preserved by the extremely dry climate of the [[Tarim Basin]]. Samples of the language have been discovered at sites in [[Kucha]] and [[Karasahr]], including many mural inscriptions.

Tocharian A and B are not [[mutually intelligible]]. Properly speaking, based on the tentative interpretation of ''twqry'' as related to ''Tokharoi'', only Tocharian A may be referred to as ''Tocharian'', while Tocharian B could be called ''Kuchean'' (its native name may have been ''kuśiññe''), but since their grammars are usually treated together in scholarly works, the terms A and B have proven useful. A common Proto-Tocharian language must precede the attested languages by several centuries, probably dating to the 1st millennium BC. Given the small geographical range of and the lack of secular texts in Tocharian A, it might alternatively have been a [[liturgical language]], the relationship between the two being similar to that between [[Classical Chinese]] and [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]. However, the lack of a secular corpus in Tocharian A is by no means definite, due to the fragmentary preservation of Tocharian texts in general.

The alphabet the [[Tocharians]] were using is derived from the [[Brāhmī script|Brahmi]] alphabetic syllabary ([[abugida]]) and is referred to as ''slanting Brahmi''. It soon became apparent that a large proportion of the manuscripts were translations of known [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] works in [[Sanskrit]] and some of them were even bilingual, facilitating decipherment of the new language. Besides the Buddhist and [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] religious texts, there were also monastery correspondence and accounts, commercial documents, caravan permits, and medical and magical texts, and one love poem. Many Tocharians embraced Manichaean duality or Buddhism.

In 1998, Chinese linguist [[Ji Xianlin]] published a translation and analysis of fragments of a Tocharian [[Maitreyasamiti-Nataka]] discovered in 1974 in [[Yanqi Hui Autonomous County|Yanqi]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.salon.com/tech/htww/2008/01/29/fragments_of_the_tocharian/index.html Fragments of the Tocharian]", Andrew Leonard, ''How the World Works'', [[Salon.com]], January 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3107526 Review of 'Fragments of the Tocharian A Maitreyasamiti-Nataka of the Xinjiang Museum, China. In Collaboration with Werner Winter and Georges-Jean Pinault by Ji Xianlin']", J. C. Wright, ''[[Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies]]'', [[University of London]], Vol. 62, No. 2 (1999), pp. 367–370&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/3110149044 Fragments of the Tocharian a Maitreyasamiti-Nataka of the Zinjiang Museum, China]", Ji Xianlin, Werner Winter, Georges-Jean Pinault, ''Trends in Linguistics, Studies and Monographs''&lt;/ref&gt;

Tocharian script probably died out after 840, when the [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] were expelled from Mongolia by the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], retreating to the Tarim Basin. This theory is supported by the discovery of translations of Tocharian texts into Uyghur. During Uyghur rule, the peoples mixed with the Uyghurs to produce much of the modern population of what is now [[Xinjiang]].

==The Tocharian Script==

The Tocharian script is based on Brahmi, where each consonant has an inherent vowel, which can be altered by adding a vowel mark, or removed with a special nullifying mark, the [[virama]]. Like Brahmi, Tocharian uses stacking for conjunct consonants, and has irregular conjunct forms of [[File:Tocharian letter ra.gif|30px]], ra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gippert|first=Jost|title=Tocharian Brahmi Script|url=http://titus.fkidg1.uni-frankfurt.de/didact/idg/toch/tochbr.htm|publisher=TITUS Didactica|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Vertigo''' is a symptom where a person feels as if they or the objects around them are moving when they are not.&lt;ref name=AFP2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Post|first1=RE|last2=Dickerson|first2=LM|title=Dizziness: a diagnostic approach|journal=American Family Physician|year=2010|volume=82|issue=4|pages=361–369|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2010/0815/p361.html|pmid=20704166|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606214343/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2010/0815/p361.html|archivedate=2013-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often it feels like a spinning or swaying movement.&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hog2015/&gt; This may be associated with [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], sweating, or difficulties walking.&lt;ref name=Hog2015/&gt; It is typically worse when the head is moved.&lt;ref name=Hog2015/&gt; Vertigo is the most common type of [[dizziness]].&lt;ref name=Hog2015/&gt;

&lt;!-- Diagnosis --&gt;
Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is more likely in someone who gets repeated episodes of vertigo with movement and is otherwise normal between these episodes.&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt; The episodes of vertigo should last less than one minute.&lt;ref name=Hog2015/&gt; The [[Dix-Hallpike test]] typically produces a period of rapid eye movements known as [[nystagmus]] in this condition.&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt; In Ménière's disease there is often [[tinnitus|ringing in the ears]], [[hearing loss]], and the attacks of vertigo last more than twenty minutes.&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt; In labyrinthitis the onset of vertigo is sudden and the nystagmus occurs without movement.&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt; In this condition vertigo can last for days.&lt;ref name=Hog2015/&gt; More severe causes should also be considered.&lt;ref name=Emerg2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerber|first1=KA|title=Vertigo and dizziness in the emergency department|journal=Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America|year=2009|volume=27|issue=1|pages=39–50|pmid=19218018|doi=10.1016/j.emc.2008.09.002|pmc=2676794}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true if other problems such as weakness, headache, [[diplopia|double vision]], or numbness occur.&lt;ref name=Hog2015/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and society --&gt;
Dizziness affects approximately 20–40% of people at some point in time, while about 7.5–10% have vertigo.&lt;ref name=Bre2011&gt;{{cite journal| last1=von Brevern|first1=M|last2=Neuhauser|first2=H| title=Epidemiological evidence for a link between vertigo &amp; migraine| journal= Journal of Vestibular Research |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=299–304|year= 2011 |pmid=22348934|doi=10.3233/VES-2011-0423}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 5% have vertigo in a given year.&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt; It becomes more common with age and affects women two to three times more often than men.&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt; Vertigo accounts for about 2–3% of emergency department visits in the [[developed world]].&lt;ref name=Epi09&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Neuhauser HK, Lempert T |title=Vertigo: epidemiologic aspects |journal=Seminars in Neurology |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=473–81 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19834858 |doi=10.1055/s-0029-1241043 |url=http://edoc.rki.de/oa/articles/redMw1x2qc1PA/PDF/28bPty5WOzjUE.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Vertigo is classified into either peripheral or central depending on the location of the dysfunction of the vestibular pathway,&lt;ref name="Hearing loss"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wippold 2nd|first1=FJ|last2=Turski|first2=PA|title=Vertigo and hearing loss|journal=American Journal of Neuroradiology|year=2009|volume=30|issue=8|pages=1623–1625|pmid=19749077|url=http://www.ajnr.org/content/30/8/1623.long|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205084120/http://www.ajnr.org/content/30/8/1623.long|archivedate=2013-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  although it can also be caused by psychological factors.&lt;ref name="urlChapter 14: Evaluation of the Dizzy Patient"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dons/part_2/chapter_14.html#chpt_14_evaluation|title=Chapter 14: Evaluation of the Dizzy Patient|format=|work=|accessdate=2009-08-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706143716/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dons/part_2/chapter_14.html#chpt_14_evaluation|archivedate=2009-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vertigo can also be classified into objective, subjective, and pseudovertigo. Objective vertigo describes when the person has the sensation that stationary objects in the environment are moving.&lt;ref name="Merck &amp; Co Inc"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Merck manual of diagnostics and therapy|year=1992|publisher=Merck &amp; Co Inc.|location=Rahway|pages=2844|editor=Berkow R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjective vertigo refers to when the person feels as if they are moving.&lt;ref name="Merck &amp; Co Inc"/&gt; The third type is known as pseudovertigo, an intensive sensation of rotation inside the person's head. While this classification appears in textbooks, it has little to do with the [[pathophysiology]] or treatment of vertigo.&lt;ref name="Adams and Victor’s Principles of Neurology"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ropper|first=AH|title=Adams and Victor’s Principles of Neurology|year=2005|location=NY, Chicago, San Francisco|pages=1398|edition=eighth|author2=Brown RH }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peripheral===
Vertigo that is caused by problems with the [[inner ear]] or [[vestibular system]], which is composed of the [[semicircular canal]]s, the [[vestibule of the ear|vestibule]] ([[utricle (ear)|utricle]] and [[saccule]]), and the [[vestibular nerve]] is called "peripheral", "otologic" or "vestibular" vertigo.&lt;ref name="Medline"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001432.htm |title=Vertigo-associated disorders |author=U.S. National Library of Medicine |year=2011 |work= |publisher=National Institutes of Health |accessdate=2 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125053802/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001432.htm |archivedate=25 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Karatas2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karatas|first=M|title=Central Vertigo and Dizziness|journal=The Neurologist|year=2008|volume=14|issue=6|pages=355–364|doi=10.1097/NRL.0b013e31817533a3|pmid=19008741}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common cause is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo ([[BPPV]]), which accounts for 32% of all peripheral vertigo.&lt;ref name="Karatas2008" /&gt; Other causes include [[Ménière's disease]] (12%), [[superior canal dehiscence syndrome]], [[labyrinthitis]], and visual vertigo.&lt;ref name="Karatas2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Visual vertigo: symptom assessment, spatial orientation and postural control|journal=Brain|volume=124|issue=8|pages=1646–1656|year=2001|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/124/8/1646|doi=10.1093/brain/124.8.1646|last1=Guerraz|first1=M.|pmid=11459755|last2=Yardley|first2=L|last3=Bertholon|first3=P|last4=Pollak|first4=L|last5=Rudge|first5=P|last6=Gresty|first6=MA|last7=Bronstein|first7=AM|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217020751/http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/124/8/1646|archivedate=2010-02-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Any cause of inflammation such as [[common cold]], [[influenza]], and bacterial infections may cause transient vertigo if it involves the inner ear, as may chemical insults (e.g., [[aminoglycoside]]s)&lt;ref name="aminoglycoside"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xie|first1=J|last2=Talaska|first2=AE|last3=Schacht|first3=J|title=New developments in aminoglycoside therapy and ototoxicity|journal=Hearing Research |year=2011|volume=281|issue=1–2|pages=28–37|pmid=21640178|doi=10.1016/j.heares.2011.05.008|pmc=3169717}}&lt;/ref&gt; or physical trauma (e.g., skull fractures).  [[Motion sickness]] is sometimes classified as a cause of peripheral vertigo.

People with peripheral vertigo typically present with mild to moderate [[balance disorder|imbalance]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[deafness|hearing loss]], [[tinnitus]], fullness, and pain in the ear.&lt;ref name="Karatas2008" /&gt; In addition, lesions of the internal auditory canal may be associated with facial weakness on the same side.&lt;ref name="Karatas2008" /&gt; Due to a rapid compensation process, acute vertigo as a result of a peripheral lesion tends to improve in a short period of time (days to weeks).&lt;ref name="Karatas2008" /&gt;

===Central===
Vertigo that arises from injury to the balance centers of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), often from a lesion in the [[brainstem]] or [[cerebellum]],&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt;&lt;ref name="Medline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Advances"/&gt; is called "central" vertigo and is generally associated with less prominent movement illusion and [[nausea]] than vertigo of peripheral origin.&lt;ref name="Dieterich (2007)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dieterich|first=Marianne|title=Central vestibular disorders|journal=Journal of Neurology|year=2007|volume=254|pages=559–568|doi=10.1007/s00415-006-0340-7|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x62437220t306gr6/|issue=5|pmid=17417688}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Central vertigo may have accompanying [[neurological deficit|neurologic deficits]] (such as [[slurred speech]] and [[diplopia|double vision]]), and [[pathologic nystagmus]] (which is pure vertical/torsional).&lt;ref name="Karatas2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dieterich (2007)" /&gt; Central pathology can cause [[Equilibrioception|disequilibrium]] which is the sensation of being off balance. The [[balance disorder]] associated with central lesions causing vertigo is often so severe that many patients are unable to stand or walk.&lt;ref name="Karatas2008" /&gt;

A number of conditions that involve the central nervous system may lead to vertigo including:  lesions caused by [[infarction]]s or [[hemorrhagic stroke|hemorrhage]], [[brain tumor|tumors]] present in the [[cerebellopontine angle]] such as a [[vestibular schwannoma]] or cerebellar tumors,&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hearing loss"/&gt; [[epilepsy]],&lt;ref name="adolescent"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=J|last2=Goodkin|first2=HP|title=Dizziness and vertigo in the adolescent|journal=Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America|year=2011|volume=44|issue=2|pages=309–321|pmid=21474006|doi=10.1016/j.otc.2011.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cervical spine]] disorders such as [[cervical spondylosis]],&lt;ref name="Hearing loss"/&gt; degenerative ataxia disorders,&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt; [[Migraine|migraine headaches]],&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt; [[lateral medullary syndrome]], [[Chiari malformation]],&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt; [[multiple sclerosis]],&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt; [[parkinsonism]], as well as cerebral dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Karatas2008" /&gt; Central vertigo may not improve or may do so more slowly than vertigo caused by disturbance to peripheral structures.&lt;ref name="Karatas2008" /&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Vertigo is a sensation of spinning while stationary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec06/ch080/ch080c.html |title=Vertigo: Dizziness and Vertigo: Merck Manual Home Edition |work= |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213014133/http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec06/ch080/ch080c.html |archivedate=2010-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is commonly associated with [[nausea]] or [[vomiting]],&lt;ref name="adolescent"/&gt; [[balance disorder|unsteadiness]] (postural instability),&lt;ref name="Advances"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jahn |first1=K|last2=Dieterich|first2=M| title=Recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of balance disorders| journal=Journal of Neurology |volume=258 |issue=12 |pages=2305–2308|date=December 2011|pmid=22037955|doi=10.1007/s00415-011-6286-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; falls,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Vieira |first1=ER|last2=Freund-Heritage|first2=R|last3=Da Costa|first3=BR| title=Risk factors for geriatric patient falls in rehabilitation hospital settings: a systematic review| journal=Clinical Rehabilitation |volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=788–799|date=September 2011|pmid=21504956|doi=10.1177/0269215511400639}}&lt;/ref&gt; changes to a person's thoughts, and difficulties in walking.&lt;ref name="Rehab"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1413-35552010000500003&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|last1=Ricci|first1=NA|last2=Aratani|first2=MC|last3=Doná|first3=F|last4=MacEdo|first4=C|last5=Caovilla|first5=HH|last6=Ganança|first6=FF|title=A systematic review about the effects of the vestibular rehabilitation of middle-age and older adults|journal=Revista brasileira de fisioterapia|volume=14|issue=5|pages=361–371|year=2010|pmid=21180862|doi=10.1590/S1413-35552010000500003|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627225603/http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1413-35552010000500003&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|archivedate=2013-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recurrent episodes in those with vertigo are common and frequently impair the [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt; [[Blurred vision]], difficulty in speaking, a lowered level of [[consciousness]], and hearing loss may also occur. The signs and symptoms of vertigo can present as a persistent (insidious) onset or an episodic (sudden) onset.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Strupp|first1=M|last2=Thurtell|first2=MJ|last3=Shaikh|first3=AG|last4=Brandt|first4=T|last5=Zee|first5=DS|last6=Leigh|first6=RJ| title=Pharmacotherapy of vestibular and ocular motor disorders, including nystagmus| journal=Journal of Neurology |volume= 258 |issue=7 |pages=1207–1222|date=July 2011|pmid=21461686|doi=10.1007/s00415-011-5999-8 | pmc= 3132281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persistent onset vertigo is characterized by symptoms lasting for longer than one day&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; and is caused by degenerative changes that affect balance as people age. Naturally, the nerve conduction slows with aging and a decreased vibratory sensation is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Kaneko|first1=A|last2=Asai|first2=N|last3=Kanda|first3=T|title=The influence of age on pressure perception of static and moving two-point discrimination in normal subjects| journal=Journal of Hand Therapy|volume= 18 |issue=4 |pages=421–424|year= 2005 |pmid=16271689 |doi=10.1197/j.jht.2005.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, there is a degeneration of the [[osseous ampullae|ampulla]] and [[otolith]] organs with an increase in age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Kutz Jr|first1=JW| title=The dizzy patient| journal=Medical Clinics of North America |volume= 94 |issue=5 |pages=989–1002|date=September 2010|pmid=20736108|doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2010.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persistent onset is commonly paired with central vertigo signs and symptoms.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

The characteristics of an episodic onset vertigo are indicated by symptoms lasting for a smaller, more memorable amount of time, typically lasting for only seconds to minutes.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; Typically, episodic vertigo is correlated with peripheral symptoms.

==Pathophysiology==
The neurochemistry of vertigo includes six primary [[neurotransmitter]]s that have been identified between the three-neuron arc&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jn.physiology.org/content/92/1/20.long|last1=Angelaki|first1=DE|title=Eyes on target: what neurons must do for the vestibuloocular reflex during linear motion|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|volume=92|issue=1|pages=20–35|date=July 2004|pmid=15212435|doi=10.1152/jn.00047.2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306072618/http://jn.physiology.org/content/92/1/20.long|archivedate=2016-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that drives the [[vestibulo-ocular reflex]] (VOR). Glutamate maintains the resting discharge of the central vestibular neurons and may modulate [[chemical synapse|synaptic transmission]] in all three neurons of the VOR arc. Acetylcholine appears to function as an excitatory neurotransmitter in both the peripheral and central synapses. [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid]] (GABA) is thought to be inhibitory for the commissures of the [[medial vestibular nucleus]], the connections between the cerebellar [[Purkinje cells]], and the [[lateral vestibular nucleus]], and the vertical VOR.

Three other neurotransmitters work centrally. [[Dopamine]] may accelerate vestibular compensation. [[Norepinephrine]] modulates the intensity of central reactions to vestibular stimulation and facilitates compensation. [[Histamine]] is present only centrally, but its role is unclear.

Tests for vertigo often attempt to elicit nystagmus and to differentiate vertigo from other causes of dizziness such as [[presyncope]], [[hyperventilation syndrome]], [[Equilibrioception|disequilibrium]], or psychiatric causes of lightheadedness.&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt; Tests of [[vestibular system]] (balance) function include [[electronystagmography]] (ENG),&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt; Dix-Hallpike maneuver,&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt; rotation tests, head-thrust test,&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt; [[caloric reflex test]],&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcm.edu/oto/studs/vertigo.html |title=Core Curriculum: Inner Ear Disease&amp;nbsp;—Vertigo |publisher=Baylor College of Medicine |date=23 January 2006|accessdate=19 September 2007|work= |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070630173414/http://www.bcm.edu/oto/studs/vertigo.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Posturography|computerized dynamic posturography]] (CDP).&lt;ref name="tests"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vestibular.org/understanding-vestibular-disorder/diagnosis |title=Diagnosis: How are vestibular disorders diagnosed? |year=2013 |work= |publisher=Vestibular Disorders Association |accessdate=9 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122002724/http://vestibular.org/understanding-vestibular-disorder/diagnosis |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HINTS test, which is a combination of three physical exam tests that may be performed by physicians at the bedside has been deemed helpful in differentiating between central and peripheral causes of vertigo. The HINTS test involves the horizontal head impulse test, observation of nystagmus on primary gaze, and the test of skew.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Does my dizzy patient have a stroke?

Tests of [[auditory system]] (hearing) function include [[pure tone audiometry]], speech audiometry, [[acoustic reflex]], [[electrocochleography]] (ECoG), [[otoacoustic emissions]] (OAE), and the [[Auditory brainstem response|auditory brainstem response test]].&lt;ref name="tests"/&gt;

A number of specific conditions can cause vertigo.  In the elderly, however, the condition is often multifactorial.&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt;

A recent history of [[underwater diving]] can indicate a possibility of barotrauma or decompression sickness involvement but does not exclude all other possibilities. The dive profile (which is frequently recorded by [[dive computer]]) can be useful to assess a probability for decompression sickness, which can be confirmed by [[therapeutic recompression]].&lt;ref name="Nachum et al 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nachum|first1=Z|last2=Shupak|first2=A|last3=Spitzer|first3=O|last4=Sharoni|first4=Z|last5=Doweck|first5=I|last6=Gordon|first6=C.R.|title=Inner ear decompression sickness in sport compressed-air diving.|journal=The Laryngoscope|publisher=The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.|location=Philadelphia|date=May 2001|volume=111|issue=5|pages=851–6.|doi=10.1097/00005537-200105000-00018|pmid=11359165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo===
[[Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo]] (BPPV) is the most common vestibular disorder&lt;ref name=Bre2011/&gt; and occurs when loose [[calcium carbonate]] debris has broken off of the otoconial membrane and enters a semicircular canal thereby creating the sensation of motion.&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt; Patients with BPPV may experience brief periods of vertigo, usually under a minute,&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt; which occur with change in the position.&lt;ref name="Benign"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001420.htm |title=Benign positional vertigo |author=MedlinePlus |year=2011 |work= |publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health |accessdate=2 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125002721/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001420.htm |archivedate=25 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the most common cause of vertigo.&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt; It occurs in 0.6% of the population yearly with 10% having an attack during their lifetime.&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt;  It is believed to be due to a mechanical malfunction of the inner ear.&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt;  BPPV may be diagnosed with the [[Dix-Hallpike test]] and can be effectively treated with repositioning movements such as the [[Epley maneuver]].&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt;&lt;ref name="Benign"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brazil"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alvarenga|first1=GA|last2=Barbosa|first2=MA|last3=Porto|first3=CC|title=Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo without nystagmus: diagnosis and treatment|journal=Brazilian Journal of Otorhinolaryngology|year=2011|volume=77|issue=6|pages=799–804|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1808-86942011000600018&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|pmid=22183288|doi=10.1590/S1808-86942011000600018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627221552/http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1808-86942011000600018&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|archivedate=2013-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://apps.elsevier.es/watermark/ctl_servlet?_f=10&amp;pident_articulo=13153812&amp;pident_usuario=0&amp;pcontactid=&amp;pident_revista=495&amp;ty=150&amp;accion=L&amp;origen=elsevier&amp;web=www.elsevier.es&amp;lan=en&amp;fichero=295v25n05a13153812pdf001_2.pdf|last1=Prim-Espada|first1=MP|last2=De Diego-Sastre|first2=JI|last3=Pérez-Fernández|first3=E|title=[Meta-analysis on the efficacy of Epley's manoeuvre in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo]|journal=Neurologia|volume=25|issue=5|pages=295–299|date=June 2010|pmid=20643039|doi=10.1016/j.nrl.2010.01.004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219194204/http://apps.elsevier.es/watermark/ctl_servlet?_f=10&amp;pident_articulo=13153812&amp;pident_usuario=0&amp;pcontactid=&amp;pident_revista=495&amp;ty=150&amp;accion=L&amp;origen=elsevier&amp;web=www.elsevier.es&amp;lan=en&amp;fichero=295v25n05a13153812pdf001_2.pdf|archivedate=2013-02-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ménière's disease===
[[Ménière's disease]] is an inner ear disorder of unknown origin, but is thought to be caused by an increase in the amount of [[Endolymph|endolymphatic fluid]] present in the inner ear (endolymphatic hydrops).&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt; However, this idea has not been directly confirmed with [[Histopathology|histopathologic]] studies but [[Electrophysiology study|electrophysiologic studies]] have been suggestive of this mechanism.&lt;ref name="relentless"/&gt; Ménière's disease frequently presents with recurrent, spontaneous attacks of severe vertigo in combination with ringing in the ears ([[tinnitus]]), a feeling of pressure or fullness in the ear (aural fullness), severe nausea or vomiting, imbalance, and hearing loss.&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt;&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="relentless"&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Semaan|first1=MT|last2=Megerian|first2=CA|title=Ménière's disease: a challenging and relentless disorder| journal=Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America |volume= 44 |issue=2 |pages=383–403|date=April 2011|pmid=21474013|doi=10.1016/j.otc.2011.01.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the disease worsens, hearing loss will progress.

===Labyrinthitis===
[[Labyrinthitis]] presents with severe vertigo&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt; with associated nausea, vomiting, and generalized imbalance and is believed to be caused by a viral infection of the inner ear though several theories have been put forward and the cause remains uncertain.&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neuritis"&gt;{{cite journal|url=| last1=Goddard |first1=JC|last2=Fayad|first2=JN| title=Vestibular Neuritis| journal=Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America |volume=44  |issue=2 |pages=361–365|year=2011 |pmid=21474010|doi=10.1016/j.otc.2011.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with vestibular neuritis do not typically have auditory symptoms but may experience a sensation of aural fullness or tinnitus.&lt;ref name="Neuritis"/&gt; Persisting balance problems may remain in 30% of people affected.&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt;

===Vestibular migraine===
[[Vestibular migraine]] is the association of vertigo and [[migraine]]s and is one of the most common causes of recurrent, spontaneous episodes of vertigo.&lt;ref name=Bre2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt; The cause of vestibular migraines is currently unclear;&lt;ref name=Bre2011/&gt; however, one hypothesized cause is that the stimulation of the [[trigeminal nerve]] leads to [[nystagmus]] in individuals suffering from migraines.&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt; 

Other suggested causes of vestibular migraines include the following: unilateral neuronal instability of the vestibular nerve, idiopathic asymmetric activation of the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem, and [[vasospasm]] of the blood vessels supplying the labyrinth or central vestibular pathways resulting in [[ischemia]] to these structures.&lt;ref name="adolescent"/&gt; Vestibular migraines are estimated to affect 1-3% of the general population&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt; and may affect 10% of migraine patients.&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt; Additionally, vestibular migraines tend to occur more often in women and rarely affect individuals after the sixth decade of life.&lt;ref name=Bre2011/&gt; 

===Motion sickness===
[[Motion sickness]] is common and is related to vestibular migraine. It is nausea and vomiting in response to motion and is typically worse if the journey is on a winding road or involves lots of stops and starts, or if the person is reading in a moving car. It is caused by a mismatch between visual input and vestibular sensation. For example, the person is reading a book which is stationary in relation to the body but the vestibular system senses that the car, and thus the body, is moving.

===Alternobaric vertigo===
{{main|Alternobaric vertigo}}
Alternobaric vertigo is caused by a pressure difference between the middle ear cavities, usually due to blockage or partial blockage of one eustachian tube, usually when flying or diving underwater. It is most pronounced when the diver is in the vertical position; the spinning is towards the ear with the higher pressure and tends to develop when the pressures differ by 60&amp;nbsp;cm of water or more.&lt;ref name="Powell 2008" &gt;{{cite book  | last = Powell  | first = Mark  | year = 2008  | title = Deco for Divers  | publisher = Aquapress  | location = Southend-on-Sea  | isbn = 978-1-905492-07-7  |page=70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross 1976"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=HE |title=The direction of apparent movement during transient pressure vertigo |journal=Undersea Biomedical Research |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=403–10 |date=December 1976 |pmid=10897867 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2442 |accessdate=2 June 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709042055/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2442 |archivedate=9 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decompression sickness===
{{see|Decompression sickness}}

Vertigo is recorded as a symptom of decompression sickness in 5.3% of cases by the US Navy as reported by Powell, 2008 &lt;ref name=" Powell 2008" /&gt; It including isobaric decompression sickness.

Decompression sickness can also be caused at a constant ambient pressure when switching between gas mixtures containing different proportions of inert gas. This is known as [[isobaric counterdiffusion]], and presents a problem for very deep dives.&lt;ref name="Hamilton &amp; Thalmann" &gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Hamilton  | first1 = Robert W  | last2 = Thalmann  | first2 = Edward D  | author2-link = Edward D. Thalmann  | year = 2003  | chapter = 10.2: Decompression Practice  | editor1-last = Brubakk  | editor1-first = Alf O  | editor2-last = Neuman  | editor2-first = Tom S  | title = Bennett and Elliott's physiology and medicine of diving  | edition = 5th Revised  | publisher = Saunders  | location = United States  | oclc = 51607923  | isbn = 978-0-7020-2571-6 |page=477 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, after using a very helium-rich [[trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]] at the deepest part of the dive, a diver will switch to mixtures containing progressively less helium and more oxygen and nitrogen during the ascent. Nitrogen diffuses into tissues 2.65 times slower than helium, but is about 4.5 times more soluble. Switching between gas mixtures that have very different fractions of nitrogen and helium can result in "fast" tissues (those tissues that have a good blood supply) actually increasing their total inert gas loading. This is often found to provoke inner ear decompression sickness, as the ear seems particularly sensitive to this effect.&lt;ref name="burton2004"&gt;{{cite web | last = Burton | first = Steve | title = Isobaric Counter Diffusion | publisher = ScubaEngineer | date = December 2004 | url = http://www.scubaengineer.com/isobaric_counter_diffusion.htm | accessdate = 10 January 2010 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090310021040/http://www.scubaengineer.com/isobaric_counter_diffusion.htm | archivedate = 10 March 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stroke ===
A stroke (either ischemic or hemorrhagic) involving the [[Posterior cranial fossa|posterior fossa]] is a cause of central vertigo.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Risk factors for a stroke as a cause of vertigo include increasing age and known vascular risk factors. Presentation may more often involve headache or neck pain, additionally, those who have had multiple episodes of dizziness in the months leading up to presentation are suggestive of stroke with prodromal [[Transient ischemic attack|TIAs]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The HINTS exam as well as imaging studies of the brain ([[CT scan|CT]], CT [[Computed tomography angiography|angiogram]], and/or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]) are helpful in diagnosis of posterior fossa stroke.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Management==
Definitive treatment depends on the underlying cause of  vertigo.&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt; Ménière's disease patients have a variety of treatment options to consider when receiving treatment for vertigo and tinnitus including: a low-salt diet and intratympanic injections of the antibiotic [[gentamicin]] or surgical measures such as a shunt or ablation of the [[Labyrinth (inner ear)|labyrinth]] in refractory cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Huon|first1=LK|last2=Fang|first2=TY|last3=Wang|first3=PC| title=Outcomes of intratympanic gentamicin injection to treat Ménière's disease| journal= Otology &amp; Neurotology  |volume= 33 |issue=5 |pages=706–714|date=July 2012|pmid=22699980|doi=10.1097/MAO.0b013e318259b3b1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Common drug treatment options for vertigo may include the following:&lt;ref name="medication"&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Huppert|first1=D|last2=Strupp|first2=M|last3=Mückter|first3=H|last4=Brandt|first4=T| title=Which medication do I need to manage dizzy patients?| journal= Acta Oto-Laryngologica  |volume= 131 |issue=3 |pages=228–241|date=March 2011|pmid=21142898|doi=10.3109/00016489.2010.531052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Corticosteroids]] such as [[methylprednisolone]] for inflammatory conditions such as vestibular neuritis or [[dexamethasone]] as a second-line agent for Ménière's disease

All cases of decompression sickness should be treated initially with 100% oxygen until [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] (100% oxygen delivered in a high-pressure chamber) can be provided.&lt;ref name="Marx 2010" &gt;{{cite book  | last = Marx  | first = John  | year = 2010  | title = Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice  | edition = 7th  | publisher = Mosby/Elsevier  | location = Philadelphia, PA  | isbn = 978-0-323-05472-0  |page=1813 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several treatments may be necessary, and treatment will generally be repeated until either all symptoms resolve, or no further improvement is apparent.

==Etymology==
Vertigo is from the [[Latin]] word ''[[wikt:en:verto#Latin|vertō]]'' which means "a whirling or spinning movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/vertigo |title=Definition of vertigo |publisher=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=2007-09-19 |format= |work= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007024206/http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/vertigo |archivedate=2007-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Vislangbib.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Visible Language,'' issue 36.2]]
'''''Visible Language''''' is an American journal presenting visual communication research. Founded in 1967 as ''The Journal of Typographical Research'' by Merald Wrolstad, occasional ''Visible Language'' issues are co-edited with a guest editor-author. 

The journal was founded with the primary tenet of the journal being that reading and writing together form a new, separate, and autonomous language system. The journal has evolved to focus on research in visual communication. The journal has covered the subject of [[concrete poetry]], the [[Fluxus]] art movement, painted text, [[textual criticism]], the abstraction of symbols, [[articulatory synthesis]] and text, and the evolution of the page from print to on-screen display. Guest editor-authors have included [[Colin Banks]], [[John Cage]], [[Adrian Frutiger]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Richard Kostelanetz]], [[Craig J Saper|Craig Saper]], and [[George Steiner]].

The journal was edited for 26 years (1987-2012) by Sharon Poggenpohl of the [[Illinois Institute of Technology|Illinois Institute of Technology's]] [[IIT Institute of Design|Institute of Design]], with administrative offices at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]]. It is currently edited by Mike Zender of the University of Cincinnati, which publishes and provides administrative offices for the journal.

The '''2001 [[World Conference against Racism]] (WCAR)''', also known as '''Durban I''', was held at the [[Durban International Convention Centre]] in [[Durban]], South Africa, under [[UN]] auspices, from 31 August to 8 September 2001.

The conference covered several controversial issues, including [[redress]] for transatlantic [[slavery]] and the [[Second-class citizen]]ry issue in Palestine-Israel.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/legacy/campaigns/race/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/WCAR/pressreleases/rd-d21.html&lt;/ref&gt; The language of the final Declaration and Programme of Action produced by the conference was strongly disputed in these areas, both in the preparatory meetings in the months that preceded the conference and during the conference itself.

Two delegations, the United States and Israel, withdrew from the conference over objections to a draft document [[equating Zionism with racism]]. The final Declaration and Programme of Action did not contain the text that the U.S. and Israel had objected to, that text having been voted out by delegates in the days after the U.S. and Israel withdrew.

In parallel to the conference, a separately held NGO Forum also produced a Declaration and Programme of its own, that was not an official Conference document, which contained language relating to Israel that the WCAR had voted to exclude from its Declaration, and which was criticized by then [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Mary Robinson]] and many others.

The NGO Forum ended in discord. Mary Robinson lost the support of the United States in her office of High Commissioner, and many of the potential political aftereffects of the conference were annulled by the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. The attacks took place just three days after the conference ended, entirely eclipsing it in the news, and significantly affecting international relations and politics. The conference was followed by the 2009 [[Durban II]] conference in [[Geneva]], which was boycotted by ten western countries. A commemorative [[Durban III]] conference in September 2011 in New York has also drawn significant criticism and was boycotted by 14 western countries.

== Preparations ==
The conference was authorized by [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution]] #52/111. Prior to the conference various preparatory meetings (PrepComs) were held in order to identify conference themes and to create initial drafts of the Declaration and Programme of Action. These PrepComs encountered difficulties from the start.&lt;ref name=Schechter&gt;{{cite book|pages=177&amp;ndash;182|title=United Nations Global Conferences|author=Michael G. Schechter|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-34380-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first problem was the question of what the conference theme was to be. The Western European states, along with the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, all wanted the conference objectives to be those given in the authorizing resolution. The Africa Group, the Latin American states, and the Caribbean states wanted the conference objectives to go beyond what was in the resolution, and include items dealing with regional, national, and international measures for compensation for colonialism and slavery.&lt;ref name="Schechter"/&gt;

Prior to the conference, there were also four Regional Conferences, in [[Strasbourg]], [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Dakar]], and [[Tehran]].&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;

== The Durban Declaration and Programme of Action ==
The Durban Declaration and Programme of Action was adopted by the governmental delegates attending the Conference at the International Convention Centre.

=== Compensation for Colonialism and Slavery ===
{{See also|Reparations for slavery}}

The issue of Compensation for Colonialism and Slavery is addressed in ¶ 13, ¶ 14, ¶ 15, and ¶ 29 of the Declaration. It was one of the most controversial issues debated at the conference, one that had the potential to derail the entire conference. It was dealt with cleverly in the Declaration, containing rhetoric that satisfied the African bloc, without applying retroactively against the descendants of colonizers the principle of crimes against humanity and without establishing a clear responsibility for reparations on the parts of former colonial states.&lt;ref name=Chakma&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Rights in Development Yearbook 2001: Reparations: Redressing Past Wrongs|editor=George Ulrich and Louise Krabbe Boserup|chapter=The Issue of Compensation for Colonialism and Slavery at the World Conference Against Racism|author=Suhas Chakma|pages=58&amp;ndash;71|year=2003|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=90-411-2030-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wording of the Declaration struck a delicate balance. Whilst acknowledging historic and contemporary practices of slavery and the slave trade as morally outrageous, and something that would be a crime against humanity today, it did not apply that legal principle to an era before the principle actually existed.&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;

One of the contentious points at the conference related to the issue was that of [[apartheid]]. During the preparatory processes of the conference, South Africa stressed that it did not want to link compensation to apartheid. At the Tehran Regional Conference, a paragraph making such a link was inserted by Asian governments. This was deleted at the request of the South African delegation. Linking compensation to apartheid had the potential to polarize South African society, and produce the same effects as had the controversial [[land reform in Zimbabwe|land reform programmes in Zimbabwe]]. Domestic political pressures, and the aim of the South African government to foster reconciliation within the country, made South Africa's position difficult.&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;

The issue of compensation was thus a complex one, that was exacerbated by the [[President of Senegal]], [[Abdoulaye Wade]], calling campaigns to demand compensation for colonialism and slavery "childish".&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;

The earliest point at which the issue of compensation caused problems was during preparations in May 2001, when delegations came to the decision of where to place it on the agenda. At the time, the fourth item on the agenda, out of five items, was "Provision of effective remedies, recourses, redress, compensatory, and other measures, at the national, regional, and international levels". The European Union, represented by Portugal, wanted to place the entire language in brackets. The United States just wanted to place the word "compensatory" in brackets. The African Group, Armenia, and Cuba strongly objected to both proposals, with the African Group stating that if the topic were placed in brackets, they would move for the entire text to be placed in brackets also. In the end, the U.S. proposal was adopted, with the addition of a statement in the report indicating the different perspectives on the exact meaning of those brackets. Western European states discussed informally amongst themselves, outside of the formal preparatory proceedings, what measures and levels of non-cöoperation they might adopt if the issue of compensation gained momentum at Durban itself.&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;

Before the conference, the debate over compensation was seen as dealing with the transatlantic slave trade, and the colonization of Africa by Europeans, thus pitting Western European states (including the former colonial powers of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom) and the United States against the African Group. The African Group was supported by Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;

Prior to the conference, on 2001-08-03, the African Group circulated a Non-Paper on the "Injustices of the Past", containing strong language but a generally moderate position. To this paper the E.U. responded, on 2001-08-08, with a Non-Paper of its own that addressed most, but not all, of the issues in the African Group's paper. The United States circulated a Non-Paper as well, but this turned out to be less helpful than the E.U. one.&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;

The African Group circulated a second Non-Paper on 2001-09-03 that was substantially stronger than its earlier one, with language shifts from "[[debt relief|debt cancellation]]" to "immediate and unconditional cancellation of debt", emphasis upon crimes against humanity, and calls for reparation (something which the earlier paper had not included in part because of a U.S. demand, made at a preparatory meeting in Geneva, that such language be excluded from the text).&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;

Several members of the African Group openly opposed calling for reparations. President Wade stated "We still suffer the effects of slavery and colonialism, and that cannot be evaluated in monetary terms. I find that not only absurd, but insulting.". Similarly, South Africa was more interested in devoting time and effort to more pragmatic ends, such as Western aid for the [[Millennium Africa Recovery Programme]], which would be more palatable to the U.S. and the E.U.&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;

A consensus on the reparations issue was reached by late August. On 2001-08-24 President of the United States [[George W. Bush]] announced in a press conference that "the reparations issue has been solved &amp;mdash; at least the last information I had was that the issue has … looks like it has been resolved", albeit that news media at the time failed to realize the significance of the comment. The U.S. walked out of the conference a few weeks later.&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;

=== Zionism ===

==== Draft text prior to the conference ====
During preparatory meetings in Geneva, text that linked [[Zionism]] to [[racism]] was placed in brackets, with the expectation that it would be replaced by text that referred to violations of the rights of Palestinians. The U.S. had already threatened to boycott the conference should the conference draft documents include text that could be in any way interpreted as linking Zionism to racism. [[Mary Robinson]] had also said that regional political conflicts should not be imposed upon the agenda of the conference. The Australian, the Canadian, and some European delegations shared the U.S. view.&lt;ref name=Al-Ahram&gt;{{cite news|work=Al-Ahram Weekly Online|date=9 August 2001|issue=546|location=Cairo|publisher=AL-AHRAM|author=Dina Ezzat|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/546/fr2.htm|title=Reading between the brackets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab position was stated by the Secretary General of the [[Arab League]], [[Amr Moussa]]: "Israel's racist actions against the Palestinian people have to be dealt with in an international conference that aims to eradicate racism. Arab countries are not expecting the Durban conference to be a venue for dealing with the Arab- Israeli peace process, but they certainly expect that the Israeli racist practices against the Palestinian people will not be overlooked."&lt;ref name=Al-Ahram /&gt;

The Arab delegates were not insistent upon language that specifically equated Zionism with racism. It had been suggested that they were trying to revive [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379]] (issued 1975, annulled 1991) which stated that "Zionism is a form of racism.". Their position was that they were, rather, trying to underline that the actions being committed by Israel against Palestinians were racist.&lt;ref name=Al-Ahram /&gt;

This stance was in part influenced by the U.S. threat of boycott, which would have made it impractical to insist upon harsh language condemning Israel or equating the suffering of the Palestinians with that of holocaust victims. According to one Arab diplomat, no Arab state except for Syria had insisted upon any language linking Israel to racist practices.&lt;ref name=Al-Ahram /&gt;

At the start of the Geneva meeting, text had been presented that comprised six bracketed paragraphs dealing with "Zionist racist practices", including an appeal for Israel "to revise its legislation based on racial or religious discrimination such as the law of return and all the policies of an occupying power which prevent the Palestinian refugees and displaced persons from returning to their homes and properties", and a suggestion for the need "to bring the foreign occupation of Jerusalem by Israel together with all its racist practices to an end".&lt;ref name=Al-Ahram /&gt;

By the end of the meeting, all of this text had either been removed or toned down. One such phrase removed was a mention of "holocausts" suffered by other peoples, which had been seen as an affront to the memory of the Jewish victims of [[The Holocaust|the Nazi holocaust]]. South African diplomats had already told Arab and Muslim countries that they would have to offer text that could describe the current situation without using such language as "ethnic cleansing practices against Palestinians".&lt;ref name=Al-Ahram /&gt;

Nonetheless, the United States, objecting to the remaining text, decided to send a low-level delegation, headed by Ambassador [[Michael Southwick]], to the Conference, rather than have [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] attend himself. German officials criticized this decision, and the United States [[Congressional Black Caucus]] urged him to attend. The [[Anti-Defamation League]] urged him to stay away.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;

==== Withdrawal by U.S. and Israel ====
On September 3, 2001, after four days of deadlocked negotiations that did not reach agreement on language, the United States and Israeli delegations withdrew from the conference. Both United States Secretary of State Colin Powell and [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel]] [[Shimon Peres]] stated that this was done with regret.&lt;ref name=Klusener&gt;{{cite news|title=Accusations Fly As US, Israel Walk Out Of "Bizarre" UN Conference|author=Mark Klusener|work=CNSNews.com|date=4 September 2001|url=http://www.cnsnews.com./ForeignBureaus%5Carchive%5C200109%5CFor20010904a.html|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307115734/http://www.cnsnews.com/ForeignBureaus/Archive/200109/For20010904a.html|archive-date=7 March 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite news|title=US abandons racism summit|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=3 September 2001|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1523600.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{cite news|title=Racism summit turmoil: Reactions|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=3 September 2001|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1523830.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This decision was criticized by several people, including [[Jesse Jackson]] and [[President of South Africa]] [[Thabo Mbeki]], both of whom stated their opinions that it had been a mistake by the United States to send a low-level delegation to the conference in the first place, and [[Amnesty International]], which stated that the U.S. was "letting down victims of racism". Jackson had been involved in earlier attempts to create compromise language.&lt;ref name=Klusener /&gt;

The low-level U.S. delegation had kept a low profile throughout conference proceedings until that point, with delegates working quietly in sub-committee meetings, without (unlike in earlier conferences) giving news briefings or off the record statements to journalists, to change the text of the draft declaration, to make it less forceful and less specific against Israel, and to bring it into line with U.S. foreign policy goals with respect to the [[International Criminal Court]] (see [[United States and the International Criminal Court]]) by removing language that strengthened the ICC.&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel and United States storm out from Durban Conference, denouncing draft declaration as "racist"|author=Robert E. Sullivan|date=25 September 2002|work=The Earth Times|url=http://earthtimes.org./sep/thedurbanconferenceisraelsep4_01.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The draft documents had stated "deep concern" at the "increase of racist practices of Zionism and anti-Semitism" and talked of the emergence of "movements based on racism and discriminatory ideas, in particular the Zionist movement, which is based on racial superiority". Alternative proposals, which the U.S. had supported, from Norway, acting as a mediator, and Canada were rejected by Israel.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=OQA&gt;{{cite news|title=Africa: The United States and Israel pull out of the Durban Racism Conference|work=allAfrica.com|date=3 September 2001|author=[[Ofeibea Quist-Arcton]]|location=Durban|url=http://allafrica.com./stories/200109030134.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC3&gt;{{cite news|title=Racism summit seeks breakthrough|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=5 September 2001|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1525981.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Colin Powell's denunciation of the "hateful language" that "singles out only one country in the world, Israel, for censure and abuse" in the draft text and U.S. delegate [[Tom Lantos]]'s statement that the conference had been "wrecked by Arab and Islamic extremists", some saw the U.S. delegation's withdrawal as not being entirely related to the language on Israel, but attributed it also, in part, to a reluctance on the part of the U.S. to address the issue of slavery.&lt;ref name=Klusener /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC3 /&gt;

The withdrawal of, the U.S. and Israel was taken as a warning by many delegates that there was a strong possibility of Canada and the E.U. states withdrawing as well if no compromise was reached. Several reports had the Europeans staying on solely in order to help South Africa salvage the Conference. After the withdrawal, senior conference officials became highly involved in the rewriting of the Declaration &amp;mdash; something that critics maintained they should have also been doing before that point.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;

==== Final text and subsequent reaction ====
In the end, the Conference delegates voted to reject the language that implicitly accused Israel of racism, and the document actually published contained no such language.&lt;ref name=BBC4&gt;{{cite news|date=8 September 2001|title=Mixed emotions as Durban winds up|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1530976.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several countries were unhappy with the final text's approach to the subject, but all for different reasons. Syria and Iran were unhappy because their demands for the language about racism and Israel had been rejected by the Conference, the latter continuing its insistence that Israel was a racist state. Australia was unhappy with the process, observing that "far too much of the time at the conference [had been] consumed by bitter divisive exchanges on issues which have done nothing to advance the cause of combating racism". Canada was also unhappy.&lt;ref name=BBC4 /&gt;

The language of the final text was carefully drafted for balance. The word "diaspora" is used four times, and solely to refer to the [[African Diaspora]]. The document is at pains to maintain a cohesive identity for everyone of African heritage as a victim of slavery, even including those who may have more European than African ancestors. The "victim" or "victims" of racism and slavery (the two words occurring 90 times in the document) are defined in only the most general geographic terms. The word "Jewish" is only used once, alongside "Muslim" and "Arab", and "anti-Semitism" is only used twice, once alongside its assumed counterpart of "Islamophobia" and once alongside "anti-Arabism". The difficulty that this generates is that it is politically impossible to act when the 219 calls for action in the Programme are couched in such generalities that only the "countless human beings" that the document explicitly talks of can be identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|pages=148|booktitle=Rhetorical Democracy: Discursive Practices of Civic Engagement &amp;mdash; Rhetoric Society of America Conference|editor=Gerard A. Hauser and Amy Grim|author=Jay Ellis|title=Identity across ''Bloody Meridians''|year=2003|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|ISBN= 0-8058-4264-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The NGO Forum Declaration ==
Separate from the actual Conference itself was an NGO Forum, held in the nearby [[Sahara Stadium Kingsmead|Kingsmead Stadium]] in Durban, that ran from 2001-08-28 to 2001-09-01. This was a forum of 3,000 [[non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, attended by 8,000 representatives. It, too adopted a Declaration. However, this was not an official document of the WCAR and was not issued as such.&lt;ref name=Hindu1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hindu.com./thehindu/2001/09/09/stories/05091344.htm|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=9 September 2001|title=The different shades of hatred}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UN1&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=[[United Nations]]|work=World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance|location=Durban|date=5 September 2001|title=DAILY PRESS BRIEFING|url=http://www.un.org./WCAR/pressreleases/db090501.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Forum's proceedings were highly disorganized, with several NGO delegates walking out of the Forum, to the jeers of other delegates, and ending in discord; and the resultant declaration had 62 paragraphs of introduction, followed by a document that appeared to commentators as being the result of every lobby putting its pet aversions in. It described Israel as a "racist, apartheid state" that was guilty of "racist crimes including war crimes, acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing". The document was not intended to be presented to the Conference, although a copy of it was intended to be handed over, as a symbolic gesture, to the Conference secretary-general, Mary Robinson, at the conclusion of the Forum. Ms Robinson refused to accept the document, citing concerns over its language. In a later interview she said of the whole conference that "there was horrible anti-Semitism present &amp;mdash; particularly in some of the NGO discussions. A number people said they've never been so hurt or so harassed or been so blatantly faced with an anti-Semitism."&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hindu1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=UN1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC5&gt;{{cite news|date=21 November 2002|title=Mary Robinson, UN Human Rights chief|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/forum/1673034.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Palestinian Solidarity Committee of South Africa reportedly distributed copies of the antisemitic forgery ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=8N0TwbYCycAC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=World+Conference+against+Racism+2001+protocols+of+the+elders+of+zion#v=onepage&amp;q=World%20Conference%20against%20Racism%202001%20protocols%20of%20the%20elders%20of%20zion&amp;f=false | title = Dismantling the big lie: The Protocols of the elders of Zion | isbn = 978-0-88125-786-1 | author1 = Jacobs | first1 = Steven L | last2 = Weitzman | first2 = Mark | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics described the description of [[Israel and the apartheid analogy|Israel as apartheid]] as the "Durban Strategy". They claim that this comparison was made with the intention of causing and encouraging [[divestment]] from and [[economic and political boycotts of Israel|boycott of Israel]].&lt;ref name=SteinbergCJN&gt;{{cite news|author=Steinberg, Gerald|url=http://www.jewishtoronto.net/content_display.html?ArticleID=185328|title=Anti-Israel obsessions|work=[[Canadian Jewish News]]|date=15 June 2006|publisher=United Jewish Communities}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1139395488268&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|title=The radicals behind the Anglican Church|work=[[Jerusalem Post]]|date=26 February 2006|author=Sarah Mandel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://c4rpme.org/bin/articles.cgi?Cat=activist-roadblock&amp;Subcat=sabeel&amp;ID=601 C4RPME.org: A Christmas Wish for 'Justice'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The NGO Forum was attended by U.S. NGOs, with financial support from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], the [[MacArthur Foundation]], and the [[Charles Stewart Mott Foundation]]. The [[Ford Foundation]] provided [[United States dollar|USD]]10 million in support to the WCAR and the NGO Forum. These NGOs provided research assistance at the Forum and helped to develop declarations and resolutions that dealt with the issue of compensation for slavery.&lt;ref name=Fonte&gt;{{cite book|title=Israel and the Post-Zionists: A Nation at Risk|editor=Shlomo Sharan|author=John Fonte|chapter=The Future of the Ideological Civil War Within the West|pages=136&amp;ndash;138|year=2003|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=1-903900-52-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marable&gt;{{cite web|title=The Failure of U.S. Foreign Policies|author=Manning Marable|date=17 November 2001|url=http://zmag.org./sustainers/content/2001-11/17marable.cfm|publisher=|work=Z Mag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolutions adopted by the Forum dealing with reparations for slavery dealt only with the transatlantic slave trade, and did not mention the traffic in African slaves to Islamic lands in the Middle East. The Forum also called upon the United States to ratify all major human rights treaties that had already been ratified.&lt;ref name=Fonte /&gt;

One such treaty was the UN [[Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] (CERD), which the U.S. had ratified in 1994, but (per the [[Supremacy Clause]] of [[Article Six of the United States Constitution]], which does not permit treaties to override the Constitution) had attached a reservation that its ratification did not accept treaty requirements that were incompatible with the [[Constitution of the United States]]. The NGOs, including [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], demanded that U.S. drop its reservations and "comply" with the treaty. The U.S. Department of State had noted specifically that CERD's restrictions on [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of assembly]] were incompatible with the [[First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]]. The United States was far from the only such country to do so, however. Incompatibility of the treaty with national constitutions, including the freedoms of assembly and speech guaranteed by those constitutions, is also noted by Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, France, Guyana, Jamaica, Japan, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Switzerland, and Thailand. Several, including France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malta, Monaco, Nepal, the United Kingdom, note that they consider the provisions of the treaty to be restricted by and subject to the freedoms of speech and assembly set forth in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=Fonte /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org./english/bodies/ratification/2.htm#reservations|publisher=[[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]]|title=International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination &amp;mdash; Reservations|date=18 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One commentator noted that in order to comply with the interpretation of CERD created by the NGOs at the Forum, the United States would have to "turn its political and economic system, together with their underlying principles, upside down &amp;mdash; abandoning the free speech guarantees of the Constitution, bypassing federalism, and ignoring the very concept of majority rule, since practically nothing in the NGO agenda is supported by the [U.S.] electorate", stating that these NGOs were "a new challenge to [[liberal democracy]]" that contested the principles of individual rights, democratic representation, and national citizenship, along with contesting the very idea of a liberal democratic nation-state.&lt;ref name=Fonte /&gt;

Other NGO demands included demands for:&lt;ref name=Fonte /&gt;
* U.S. acknowledgement of "the breadth and pervasiveness of institutional racism" that "permeates every institution at every level"
* a declaration that "racial bias corrupts every stage of the [U.S.] criminal justice process, from suspicion to investigation, arrest, prosecution, trial, and sentencing"
* support for and expansion of hate crimes legislation at both state and federal levels
* U.S. condemnation of any opposition to [[affirmative action]]
* U.S. recognition of an adequate standard of living as "a right, not a privilege"
* a statement that the U.S. deplored the "denial of economic rights"
* the promotion of multilingualism by the U.S. instead of "discriminatory" emphasis on English language acquisition in U.S. schools
* the denunciation of [[free market]] [[capitalism]] as a "fundamentally flawed system"

Tom Lantos assigns the blame for the withdrawal of the U.S. in part to the radicalism of many of the NGOs at the NGO Forum, to an inadequate response thereto by U.S.-based NGOs, and to the reluctance of the U.S.'s European allies to take a strong stand.&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;{{cite book|title=The United States and the Rule of Law in International Affairs|author=John Francis Murphy|pages=326&amp;ndash;328|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-52968-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The Conference was largely overshadowed in the news and in international affairs by the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], which occurred 3 days after the Conference ended.

=== Mary Robinson's tenure as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ===
As a consequence of the Conference, the United States did not support the continuation of Mary Robinson as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, where once U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] had called her a "splendid choice" for the post and the U.S. had considered her its favorite candidate for the job. She stepped down from the post in September 2002.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;

Many faults were attributed to Ms Robinson, with cumulative effect on the U.S. position. Some people stated that she lacked mediation and bureaucratic experience, and thus was unable to resolve sensitive issues at the Conference. News reports attributed her differences with the U.S. to four things: First, her views on the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel-Palestine conflict]] differed from U.S. policy. Second, the U.S. did not approve of the detached way in which she acted as secretary-general to the Conference. Third, she had openly criticized the U.S. on various matters including the treatment of prisoners at [[Camp X-Ray]], the "unsigning" of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] by the U.S., and the administration of [[capital punishment in the United States]]. Fourth, she had opposed U.S. calls to reform the election process of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;

Tom Lantos himself did not assign sole or even primary blame to Robinson for the breakdown of U.S. relations with the conference. That he assigned to the NGOs, as aforementioned, and to the member states of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]]. Moreover, several people have defended Robinson's secretary-generalship of the conference.&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;

=== NGO repudiations of the NGO Forum's Declaration ===
Several NGOs, including [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Amnesty International]], and the [[Lawyers Committee for Human Rights]], disassociated themselves from the language of the NGO Forum's Declaration that dealt with Israel and with Jews.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;

=== Followups ===
It seems unlikely to analysts that the United States will support another WCAR. However, the Declaration and Programme of Action did make provision for follow-up mechanisms. Mary Robinson stated in her closing address that the Conference was intended to be a beginning, not an end. Dr. [[Manning Marable]], of [[Columbia University in New York]], pointed out that one of the objectives of the Conference was to increase coordination in human rights activities, and to strengthen networks amongst those combating racism; and as such the actions of governments in response to the Conference are not the sole intended outcomes &amp;mdash; actions by civil society and non-governmental agencies are also required.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.columbia.edu./cu/news/01/08/UN_conference.html|publisher=[[Columbia University in New York]]|author=James Devitt|date=15 August 2001|title=Manning Marable to Address U.N. World Conference against Racism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One such follow up provision is for national governments to provide the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights with reports on their actions towards implementing the recommendations in the Programme of Action. Another is for the [[Secretary General of the United Nations]] to appoint an expert body with the remit of following up on implementation. A third is a call for the establishment of a database of practical means for addressing racism, racial discrimination, and related intolerance.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;

A Permanent Memorial Trust Fund has also been established for the creation of a memorial at the New York United Nations site. The sculpture, to be titled the Permanent Memorial to the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade, or the [[UN Slavery Memorial]], is set to be completed in 2012.

By resolution #2002/68 of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] an Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action was established, which held its first meeting in January 2003 and which meets on an annual basis.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;

In resolution #61/149 of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], passed in 1996, a [[Durban Review Conference]] was called. The conference took place in 2009, however, a number of countries expressed concern as a result of the 2001 conference. Some countries, including Australia, Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, and the United States, boycotted the conference. The Czech Republic discontinued its attendance on the first day, and twenty-three other European Union countries sent low-level delegations. In an 18 April 2009 speech, President [[Barack Obama]] announced the United States' boycott of the 2009 [[Durban Review Conference]], reaffirming the country's opposition to language perceived as anti-Israel and anti-Western.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0409/As_expected_Obama_admin_to_boycott_Durban_II_.html|publisher=[[The Politico]]|author=[[Ben Smith (journalist)|Ben Smith]]|date=18 April 2009|title=As expected, Obama admin to boycott Durban II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United Kingdom and other European countries remain undecided. On 17 February 2009, [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] Minister [[Lord Malloch-Brown]] said: "If we can’t go forward now, we will withdraw. I was at the first conference. I have never seen such a disgraceful event in quite a long international life."

=== Influence ===

The Institute for Global Jewish Affairs was founded, in part, as a response to the perceived [[Anti-Semitism]] of the Durban conference.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/showpage.asp?DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=84&amp;FID=588&amp;PID=2274&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard-Henri Lévy]] credits the conference with being one of the inspirations for his book, ''[[Left in Dark Times: A Stand Against the New Barbarism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The God That Failed: 'Left in Dark Times,' By ADAM KIRSCH, 10 September 2008 [http://www.nysun.com/arts/the-god-that-failed-left-in-dark-times-by-bernard/85499/]&lt;/ref&gt;
