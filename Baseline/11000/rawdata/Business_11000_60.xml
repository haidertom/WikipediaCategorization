'''Alfred Renard''' (21 April 1895 – 20 June 1988) was a Belgian aviation pioneer.

==Biography==

Alfred Renard was born in [[Anderlecht]] on 21 April 1895. As a youngster and inspired by the kites he saw his father make,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;André Hauet, ''Les avions Renard'', Éditions A.E.L.R., Bruxelles, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; he installed electricity and a telephone system at an uncle's farm.

In 1912, his inspiration was kindled by a prize of 10.000 [[franc]]s, offered by French car builder [[Peugeot]] to the first cyclist to make two aircraft flights of 10 meters each, relying solely on his or her own muscular power. Alfred conceived and, with help from his brother Georges, made his own device for the test: a bicycle augmented with a propeller and a fabric-covered wing, which unfolded by means of a lever when the device reached airspeed. The machine failed, however.

During [[World War I]] the brothers worked in the family home at a pedal-powered [[lathe]], producing pieces for a Brussels workshop; they also built engines. They ventured into building a five-meter-long [[blimp]] that they fill with compressed air.

The war forced Alfred Renard to suspend his studies at the [[Université libre de Bruxelles|Free University of Brussels]] and the Department of Applied Sciences, but in 1920 he earned an engineering degree in civil construction, plus a ''license'' in aeronautics.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

After study came the tour of soldier's duty - especially important in this small country that had suffered heavily under the war, and was taking part in the occupation of Western Germany. Renard served as a cartographer, designing military aerodromes. During this service he re-acquainted one of his former university teachers, [[Emile Allard]], newly appointed chief of the military aviation technical service TSA, and creator of a Belgian Aeronautical Laboratory. After several visits to [[Gustave Eiffel]] in Paris, the two of them would build a [[wind tunnel]] at [[Sint-Genesius-Rode]]. They also designed an all-metal monoplane, built at [[Zeebrugge]] by company ZACCO (best known under the French acronym [[ACAZ]]) as the [[ACAZ T-2]]. It failed to meet commercial success.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Through the same Emile Allard, Renard got in touch with [[Jean Stampe]] and his cherished dream of operating his own flying school with his self-designed and self-built solid trainer aircraft. The venture was completed with [[Maurice Vertongen]], its designs marked RSV for Renard-Stampe-Vertongen. The company statute left Renard free to keep his position as chief engineer at the Defense Ministry, meanwhile designing RSV-aircraft built and sold by [[Stampe et Vertongen]]

== Renard Constructions Aéronautiques ==

In 1925 Alfred Renard creates his own company as '''Société anonyme des avions et moteurs Renard''' in [[Brussels]]. The main activity was the design and production of aircraft engines of 100, 120 and 240&amp;nbsp;hp. Some of them served Belgian military aviation, some were sold in Poland and in the USA. Also, a Renard 240&amp;nbsp;hp engine powered the second version of Belgium's first helicopter, built by and named after Russian engineer [[Nicolas Florine]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean Boulet, ''Histoire de l'hélicoptère : racontée par ses pionniers, 1907-1956'', Éd. France-Empire, Paris, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1928, his brother Georges Renard joined the company which was then renamed '''Renard Constructions Aéronautiques'''. The brothers shifted away from engine design: their [[Renard R-31|R-31]] and [[Renard R-36|R-36]] were powered by engines from abroad.

== World War II and aftermath ==

Foreseeing the German invasion in 1940, Alfred Renard planned to move his assets to France, but not in time. During [[World War II]]  he disappeared from public view, to re-emerge in 1945 as a technical advisor with the Belgian State Railways [[NMBS]]/[[SNCB]], making a study of [[light alloy]] [[railcar]]s. In 1947 he rejoins [[Jean Stampe]], having always remained on good terms with him, to become a manager at a new company [[Stampe &amp; Renard]] till that company's dissolution in January 1970. On top of producing the [[Stampe SV.4]] trainer, he works at propeller engineering, at the development of the [[Stampe &amp; Renard SR-7]] and the [[Stampe &amp; Renard SR-45]] project.

Run over by a motorcar, Alfred Renard died on 20 June 1988.&lt;ref&gt;AELR / Fonds national Alfred Renard, Bruxelles&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aviointeriors S.p.A.''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] manufacturer of [[airline seats]].  Some of Aviointeriors' competitors include [[BE Aerospace]], [[Recaro]], and [[Zodiac Aerospace]].

==History==
===Founding===
The company was founded as a branch of the “Uno-Pi” a home furniture company part of the CIFA (Confederazione Italiana Fabbriche Arredamento) group owned by Giovanni Pofferi [1908 –1995]. 

The CIFA Group included the Permaflex brand, that introduced, in 1950, spring-mattress technology in Italy. (Permaflex, during the 1960s and the 1970s, was used in Italian common language as a generic trademark  for the spring-mattress).

The CIFA group, in an effort to expand the market of the furnishing sector, found an opportunity in commercial aviation with the ATLAS consortium of airlines: comprising [[Air France]], [[Alitalia]], [[All Nippon Airways]], [[Lufthansa]]/Condor, [[Sabena]] and (from. January 1972) [[Iberia]]. This consortium was established to create a European common technical standard for aircraft systems and a centralized purchasing office.

[[Alitalia]] sponsored within the  ATLAS consortium a joint-venture between the newborn Aviointeriors and the French Sicma. The joint-venture was established to share the aircraft cabin equipment market of the members of the ATLAS consortium.

Aviointeriors supplied seats and food trolleys for 50% of the European airlines joining ATLAS. A facility was built in Latina in 1974. The joint-venture with Sicma did not last long. Aviointeriors acquired the technical know-how to design, manufacture and sell products on its own. The company moved its headquarters from the CIFA building in [[Rome]] to the plant in Latina, where they are today.

The furnishing of the Alitalia fleet continued in the following years, but the national market was shared with another company, Alven, that Alitalia also sponsored to avoid an Italian monopoly of the cabin interiors manufacturing.

Aviointeriors expanded its market in the 1970s by developing fittings and furniture for V.I.P. [[Agusta]] helicopters and private aircraft.

===The Alven takeover===
At the beginning of the 1980s, the CIFA group suffered a financial crisis and Aviointeriors was put up for sale. After a first offer by Irvin Aerospace, the company was acquired in May 1986 by the Veneruso family owning the Alven which was, at that time, a competitor based near Naples.

Advanced seating products in the business class sector, helped Aviointeriors to reach the North and South American market, expanding also in the Far East. 

===Aviointeriors today===
Today  the company is focused on the seat market. A full range, from regional economy class seats to first class is produced and sold globally. Aviointerior products are installed on aircraft ranging from the 40 seats regional [[turboprops]] to the 400 seats intercontinental [[jetliners]].

From its initial production of mechanical economy and business class seats, Aviointeriors now include in its lineup electrically actuated lie-flat seats and full-flat seats with surrounding service furniture.
 
Among developments is a seating concept known as [[SkyRider (seat)|SkyRider]], this is a saddle-like airline seat where seat pitch is reduced to 23 inches. Aviointeriors claims that these seats allow up to 40% increase in passenger capacity.&lt;ref name=CNN-2010-09-14&gt;[[CNN]], [http://www.cnn.com/2010/TRAVEL/09/14/skyrider.compact.seats/ "Giddyup: Saddle seat a new squeeze on fliers?"], Marnie Hunte, ''14 September 2010'' (accessed 15 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph-2010-09-14&gt;[[The Daily Telegraph]], [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/8001351/SkyRider-new-saddle-seat-allows-airlines-to-cram-more-passengers.html "SkyRider: new 'saddle' seat allows airlines to 'cram' more passengers"], Andrew Hough, ''14 September 2010'' (accessed 15 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYDN-2010-09-14&gt;[[New York Daily News]], [http://www.nydailynews.com/travel/2010/09/14/2010-09-14_saddle_up_new_airplane_seat_design_is_made_for_cowpokes_not_real_passengers.html "Saddle up!

'''Benny Landa''' (born 2 June 1946) is an [[Israel|Israeli]] entrepreneur and inventor. He founded [[Indigo Digital Press]] in 1977 and The Landa Group in 2003. In the [[Printing|print production]] industry, Landa has been called the "father of commercial digital printing."&lt;ref name="haaretz"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/prophet-of-print-benny-landa-hopes-to-strike-nano-gold.premium-1.436447 Prophet of print: Benny Landa hopes to strike nano-gold]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4179777,00.html Benny Landa's invisible ink]. YNet&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography==
Ben Zion (Benny) Landa was born in [[Poland]]. When he was two years old, his family emigrated from Europe to [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]]. While in Canada, Landa’s father devised a new [[camera]] using [[bicycle]] parts and [[pulley]]s that captured images directly onto [[photographic paper]], avoiding the need for [[Photographic film|film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the Benny Landa You Never Knew|url=http://graphicartsmag.com/articles/2012/09/meet-the-benny-landa-you-never-knew/|publisher=Graphic Arts Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landa studied physics and engineering at the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology|Technion]] in Israel and psychology and literature at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. He later graduated from the [[London Film School]].

== Business career ==
In 1969, Landa began his professional career at CAPS, a micrographics research company. He helped develop a new micrographic product that earned the company a major contract with Rolls-Royce Aero Engine Division and led to Landa’s appointment as head of Research and Development.

In 1971, Benny Landa and a colleague co-founded Imtec, an international micrographics company. Landa invented the company’s core imaging technology. While researching liquid toners, he developed a method of high-speed image development which used charged pigmented particles in a liquid carrier.

Landa [[aliyah|immigrated]] to Israel in 1974. Applying the filmless imaging concept developed by his father, Landa founded Indigo Digital Printing in 1977. In 1993 at IPEX, he introduced the E-Print 1000, a digital color printing press. Bypassing the printing plate setup process, the new process eliminated numerous costly and time-consuming steps associated with offset printing. It enabled printing from a computer file directly onto paper and launched short-run, on-demand, and variable data printing into the marketplace. The Indigo digital press uses an electric charge to apply small color particles (in liquid form known as ElectroInk), thereby creating a thin, smooth, plastic layer on the substrate.  By the 1990s, Indigo became a significant alternative to traditional offset press manufacturers.

In 2002, Landa sold Indigo Digital Printing to Hewlett-Packard for US$830&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HP Acquires Indigo|url=http://americanprinter.com/alt/mag/printing_hp_acquires_indigo/|publisher=American Printer|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131211203123/http://americanprinter.com/alt/mag/printing_hp_acquires_indigo/|archivedate=2013-12-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the acquisition of Indigo, Landa established The Landa Group for nanotechnology research. Working with nanoparticles, Landa and his team  sought to capture environmental heat from the surrounding air and convert it into electricity. Landa’s research group observed that many materials exhibit unusual properties at the nano-level. They used that discovery to experiment with pigment colorants for print production.

Landa created Landa Digital Printing to further commercialize the nanotechnology solution for printing. The group developed a printing ink using the nanopigments, called Landa NanoInk and an offset digital printing process called Nanography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Basics of Nanotechnology|url=http://graphicartsmag.com/articles/2013/01/understanding-the-basics-of-the-landa-nanographic-printing-process/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landa introduced Nanography and a line of Nanographic Printing presses at Drupa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shhh. The Sex is Back in Print|url=http://printmediacentr.com/ermm-shhh-the-sex-is-back-in-print/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benny and the Ink Jets|url=http://www.myprintresource.com/article/10717823/benny-and-the-ink-jets;|publisher=My Print Resource}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Search of Benny the Prophet of Rehovot|url=http://print21.com.au/in-search-of-benny-the-prophet-of-rehovot-print21-magazine-feature/55421|publisher=Print 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012. The new nanography technology enables high-speed digital printing with B1 (41 in. / 1,050&amp;nbsp;mm) format media on all forms of substrates, including untreated paper, films or plastic. Nanography hopes to allow printers to produce short-to-medium run lengths. The cost effectiveness of the process is still to be determined as no live production presses are producing sellable work to date.

== Philanthropy ==
In 2002, Landa and his wife Patsy established the Landa Fund for Equal Opportunity Through Education which has donated more than $50&amp;nbsp;million in university scholarships. The Landa Fund also supports non-profit organizations in the fields of education and promoting tolerance and understanding between Israel’s Jewish and Arab citizens.

'''Bristle blasting''' is a [[Abrasion (mechanical)|mechanical abrasion]] cleaning process that is performed on metallic surfaces by a brush-like rotary [[power tool]]. The tool consists of sharpened, high-carbon steel wire bristle tips that are designed with a forward-angle bend, i.e., the shank of the wire is bent in the direction of tool rotation. During operation, the rotating bristle tips are brought into direct contact with the metallic surface, whereby the bristle tips strike the surface with kinetic energy that is equivalent to processes that use grit blast media. This repeated contact of sharp bristle tips with the target surface results in localized impact, rebound, and the formation of craters, thereby simultaneously cleaning and coarsening the surface, while exposing a contamination-free base metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences from conventional rotary brushes ==
The difference from conventional wire-brushing with an [[angle grinder]] lies first with the mounting of the bristles in the rotating brush. With a conventional rotary brush, the wire bristles are mounted rigidly in the hub, bristles sometimes being twisted or knotted in groups for extra stiffness. With bristle blasting, the wires are mounted resiliently in a flexible belt. As the brush rotates, immediately before contacting the work, rows of bristles are trapped behind a fixed '' 'accelerator bar' '',&lt;ref name="Monti, High speed video" &gt;{{Youtube|ce0wLgs6sZA|Monti MBX Bristle Blaster, High-Speed Video}}, Monti Surface Technologies&lt;/ref&gt; which causes them to bend backwards in their flexible mount. As the bristles pass the accelerator bar, they are released to spring forwards. The extra energy stored for each bristle when being flexed backwards is added to their kinetic energy when released, and when they impact the surface of the workpiece. This gives a more violent impact with the surface, thus greater cleaning power, compared to a simple rotary brush at the same speed.

As the geometry of the brush is also distorted from circular by the accelerator bar, the contact angle of the bristle tips with the surface is also nearer to perpendicular than the [[tangent]]ial contact of the circular rotary brush. This encourages a cleaning action and reduces the [[burnishing (metal)|burnishing]] action that can be a problem with rotary brushes, where a surface is increasingly polished, but not truly cleaned of surface adherrents. The steeper action of the tips encourages a pitting effect on the surface, which may be considered useful for further painting.&lt;ref name="Monti, High speed video" /&gt;

== Details ==
The cleaning performance of the bristle blasting process is a consequence of synchronized impact of the bristle tips onto the target surface. The tool head with the bristle belt rotates at approximately 2,500 rpm. A so-called 'accelerator bar' detains the bristle tips and by releasing them increases their kinetic energy with which they strike the surface. Immediately after the bristles strike the corroded steel surface, they retract (rebound) from the surface ('single-impact'), which results in corrosion removal and a micro-identation that exposes the sheer metallic surface. The multitude of such primary impact craters generates a texture and surface which in visual cleanliness and [[Surface roughness|roughness]] (anchor profile) mimics those obtained by grit blasting processes.&lt;ref name="Monti, High speed video" /&gt; The cleaned and coarsened surface is deemed favorable for the subsequent application and adhesion of protective films and [[industrial coating]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process and equipment ==
Bristle blasting tools are fabricated from high-carbon steel wires that protrude through a flexible circular belt. The belt, in turn, is attached to a rotating hub, which is powered by an electric or pneumatically driven spindle. The tool is lightweight, portable, and easily implemented by workers without the need for elaborate set-up or sophisticated safety apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Applications ==
Bristle blasting is most frequently used for removal of unwanted films and layers of [[corrosion]] that can form on metallic surfaces. Common applications include cleaning, preparation, and refurbishment of iron and steel components that are used for fabricating bridges, ships, and pipeline systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2653">'''Business correspondence''' means the exchange of information in a written format for the process of business activities. Business correspondence can take place between organizations, within organizations or between the customers and the organization. The correspondence refers to the written communication between persons. Hence oral communication or face to face communication is not a business correspondance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's guide to business correspondence.|year=1993|publisher=Merriam-Webster|location=Springfield, Mass.|isbn=0-87779-131-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Need for written communication==
# Maintaining a proper relationship.
# Serves as evidence.
# Create and maintain [[Good faith|goodwill]].
# Inexpensive and convenient.
# Formal communication.
# Independent of [[interpersonal skills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=L.

==Types of correspondence==

===Business letters===
[[Business letter]]s are the most formal method of communication following specific formats. They are addressed to a particular person or organization. A good business letter follows the seven C's of [[communication]]. The different types of business letters used based on their context are as follows,
# Letters of inquiry
# Letters of claim/complaints
# Letters of application
# Letters of approval/dismissal
# Letters of recommendations
# Letters of promise.
Official letters can be handwritten or printed. Modernisation has led to the usage of new means of business correspondence such as E-mail and Fax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLean|first=Scott|title=Business communication for success|year=2010|publisher=Flat World Knowledge|location=Nyack, NY|isbn=978-0-9823618-5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Email===
Email is the latest formal method of business communication. It is the most widely used method of written communication usually done in a conversational style. It is used when there is a need to communicate to large audience in an organization.

===Memorandum===
Memorandum is a document used for internal communication within an organization. Memos may be drafted by management and addressed to other employees, and it is sent with the money draft. Memos are sent to several people in a team when important business matters need to be updated to them or to a single person to have a written record of the informations.

The '''business cycle''', also known as the '''economic cycle''' or '''trade cycle''', is the downward and upward movement of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) around its long-term growth trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Madhani | first1 = P. M. | year = 2010 | title = .Rebalancing Fixed and Variable Pay in a Sales Organization: A Business Cycle Perspective | url = | journal = [[Compensation &amp; Benefits Review]] | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 179–189 | doi=10.1177/0886368709359668}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of a business cycle is the period of time containing a single boom and contraction in sequence. These fluctuations typically involve shifts over time between periods of relatively rapid economic growth ([[Economic expansion|expansions]] or booms), and periods of relative stagnation or decline ([[contraction (economics)|contraction]]s or [[recession]]s).

Business cycles are usually measured by considering the growth rate of [[value (economics)|real]] gross domestic product. Despite the often-applied term [[wikt:cycle|cycles]], these fluctuations in economic activity do not exhibit uniform or predictable periodicity.

The common or popular usage '''boom-and-bust cycle''' refers to fluctuations in which the expansion is rapid and the contraction severe.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The first systematic exposition of [[economic crises]], in opposition to the existing theory of [[economic equilibrium]], was the 1819 ''Nouveaux Principes d'économie politique'' by [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economictheories.org/2008/11/over-production-and-under-consumption.html "Over Production and Under Consumption"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425055556/http://www.economictheories.org/2008/11/over-production-and-under-consumption.html |date=2009-04-25 }}, ScarLett, History Of Economic Theory and Thought&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that point [[classical economics]] had either denied the existence of business cycles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Economics in Crisis: Severe and Logical Contradictions of Classical, Keynesian, and Popular Trade Models |last=Batra |first=R. |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; blamed them on external factors, notably war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/classical-economists-good-or-bad/|title=|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091002020124/http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/classical-economists-good-or-bad/|archivedate=2009-10-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or only studied the long term. Sismondi found vindication in the [[Panic of 1825]], which was the first unarguably international economic crisis, occurring in peacetime.

Sismondi and his contemporary [[Robert Owen]], who expressed similar but less systematic thoughts in 1817 ''Report to the Committee of the Association for the Relief of the Manufacturing Poor,'' both identified the cause of economic cycles as [[overproduction]] and [[underconsumption]], caused in particular by [[wealth inequality]]. They advocated [[government intervention]] and [[socialism]], respectively, as the solution. This work did not generate interest among classical economists, though underconsumption theory developed as a heterodox branch in economics until being systematized in [[Keynesian economics]] in the 1930s.

Sismondi's theory of periodic crises was developed into a theory of alternating ''cycles'' by [[Charles Dunoyer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benkemoune | first1 = Rabah | year = 2009 | title = Charles Dunoyer and the Emergence of the Idea of an Economic Cycle | url = http://hope.dukejournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/41/2/271 | journal = History of Political Economy | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 271–295 | doi = 10.1215/00182702-2009-003 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619161902/http://hope.dukejournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/41/2/271 | archivedate = 2009-06-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and similar theories, showing signs of influence by Sismondi, were developed by [[Johann Karl Rodbertus]]. Periodic crises in capitalism formed the basis of the theory of [[Karl Marx]], who further claimed that these crises were increasing in severity and, on the basis of which, he predicted a [[communist revolution]]. Though only passing references in ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (1867) refer to crises, they were extensively discussed in Marx's posthumously published books, particularly in ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]''. In ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'' (1879), [[Henry George]] focused on [[land (economics)|land]]'s role in crises – particularly [[land speculation]] – and proposed a [[land value tax|single tax on land]] as a solution.

=== Classification by periods ===
[[File:The Forces of the Business Cycle, 1922.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Business cycle with it specific forces in four stages according to [[Malcolm C. Rorty]], 1922]]
In 1860 French economist [[Clement Juglar]] first identified economic cycles 7 to 11 years long, although he cautiously did not claim any rigid regularity.&lt;ref&gt;
M. W. Lee, ''Economic fluctuations''. Homewood, IL, Richard D. Irwin, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; Later{{when|date=January 2014}}, economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1883–1950) argued that a [[Juglar cycle]] has four stages:

# expansion (increase in production and prices, low interest-rates)
# crisis (stock exchanges crash and multiple bankruptcies of firms occur)
# recession (drops in prices and in output, high interest-rates)
# recovery (stocks recover because of the fall in prices and incomes)

Schumpeter's Juglar model associates recovery and prosperity with increases in productivity, consumer confidence, [[aggregate demand]], and prices.

In the 20th century, Schumpeter and others proposed a typology of business cycles according to their periodicity, so that a number of particular cycles were named after their discoverers or proposers:&lt;ref&gt;

Over the period since the Industrial Revolution, technological progress has had a much larger effect on the economy than any fluctuations in credit or debt, the primary exception being the Great Depression, which caused a multi-year steep economic decline.  The effect of technological progress can be seen by the purchasing power of an average hour's work, which has grown from $3 in 1900 to $22 in 1990, measured in 2010 dollars.&lt;ref name="Legergott1993"&gt;{{cite book |title= Pursuing Happiness: American Consumers in the Twentieth Century |last=Lebergott|first=Stanley |authorlink= |year=1993 |publisher= Princeton University Press|location= Princeton, NJ |isbn= 0691043221 |pages=a:Adapted from Fig. 9.1 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were similar increases in real wages during the 19th century.  (''See: [[Productivity improving technologies (historical)]]''.)  A table of innovations and long cycles can be seen at: {{slink|Kondratiev wave|Modern modifications of Kondratiev theory}}.

There were frequent crises in Europe and America in the 19th and first half of the 20th century, specifically the period 1815–1939. This period started from the end of the [[Napoleonic wars]] in 1815, which was immediately followed by the [[Post-Napoleonic depression]] in the United Kingdom (1815–30), and culminated in the [[Great Depression]] of 1929–39, which led into [[World War II]]. See [[Financial crisis#19th century|Financial crisis: 19th century]] for listing and details. The first of these crises not associated with a war was the [[Panic of 1825]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Business cycles in [[OECD]] countries after World War II were generally more restrained than the earlier business cycles. This was particularly true during the [[Golden Age of Capitalism]] (1945/50–1970s), and the period 1945–2008 did not experience a global downturn until the [[Late-2000s recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ici.org/pdf/per02-02.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313190606/http://ici.org/pdf/per02-02.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-13 |df= }} Stock Market Cycles 1942–1995&lt;/ref&gt;   Economic stabilization policy using [[fiscal policy]] and [[monetary policy]] appeared to have dampened the worst excesses of business cycles, and [[automatic stabilization]] due to the aspects of the [[government]]'s [[budget]] also helped mitigate the cycle even without conscious action by policy-makers.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In this period, the economic cycle – at least the problem of depressions – was twice declared dead. The first declaration was in the late 1960s, when the [[Phillips curve]] was seen as being able to steer the economy. However, this was followed by [[stagflation]] in the 1970s, which discredited the theory.  The second declaration was in the early 2000s, following the stability and growth in the 1980s and 1990s in what came to be known as [[The Great Moderation]]. Notably, in 2003, [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]], in his presidential address to the [[American Economic Association]], declared that the "central problem of depression-prevention [has] been solved, for all practical purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Fighting Off Depression, New York Times, {{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/opinion/05krugman.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430040012/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/opinion/05krugman.html |archivedate=2011-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, this was followed by the [[2008–2012 global recession]].

Various regions have experienced prolonged [[depression (economics)|depressions]], most dramatically the economic crisis in former [[Eastern Bloc]] countries following the end of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991.  For several of these countries the period 1989–2010 has been an ongoing depression, with real income still lower than in 1989.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  This has been attributed not to a cyclical pattern, but to a mismanaged transition from [[command economies]] to [[market economies]].

[[File:Businesscycle figure3.jpg|thumb|upright=2.05|Deviations from the long-term US growth trend, 1954–2005.]]

In 1946, economists [[Arthur F. Burns]] and [[Wesley Clair Mitchell|Wesley C. Mitchell]] provided the now standard definition of business cycles in their book ''Measuring Business Cycles'':&lt;ref&gt;A. F. Burns and W. C. Mitchell, ''Measuring business cycles'', New York, National Bureau of Economic Research, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|sign=|source=|Business cycles are a type of fluctuation found in the aggregate economic activity of nations that organize their work mainly in business enterprises: a cycle consists of expansions occurring at about the same time in many economic activities, followed by similarly general recessions, contractions, and revivals which merge into the expansion phase of the next cycle; in duration, business cycles vary from more than one year to ten or twelve years; they are not divisible into shorter cycles of similar characteristics with amplitudes approximating their own.}}

According to A. F. Burns:&lt;ref&gt;A. F. Burns, Introduction. In: Wesley C. Mitchell, ''What happens during business cycles: A progress report''. New York, National Bureau of Economic Research, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Business cycles are not merely fluctuations in aggregate economic activity. The critical feature that distinguishes them from the commercial convulsions of earlier centuries or from the seasonal and other short term variations of our own age is that the fluctuations are widely diffused over the economy – its industry, its commercial dealings, and its tangles of finance. The economy of the western world is a system of closely interrelated parts. He who would understand business cycles must master the workings of an economic system organized largely in a network of free enterprises searching for profit. The problem of how business cycles come about is therefore inseparable from the problem of how a capitalist economy functions.}}

In the United States, it is generally accepted that the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER) is the final arbiter of the dates of the peaks and troughs of the business cycle. An expansion is the period from a trough to a peak, and a recession as the period from a peak to a trough. The NBER identifies a recession as "a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production".&lt;ref name="NBER"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/ |title=US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions |publisher=NBER |accessdate=2009-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219215409/https://www.nber.org/cycles/ |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upper turning points of business cycle, commodity prices and freight rates===
There is often a close timing relationship between the upper turning points of
the business cycle, commodity prices and freight rates, which is shown to be particularly tight
in the grand peak years of 1873, 1889, 1900 and 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Tore Klovland {{cite web |url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeeexehis/v_3a46_3ay_3a2009_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a266-284.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222133500/http://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeeexehis/v_3a46_3ay_3a2009_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a266-284.htm |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spectral analysis of business cycles ===
Recent research employing [[Frequency domain|spectral analysis]] has confirmed the presence of [[Kondratiev wave]]s in the world GDP dynamics at an acceptable level of statistical significance.&lt;ref name="See"&gt;See, e.g. [[Korotayev]], Andrey V., &amp; Tsirel, Sergey V. [http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/9jv108xp A Spectral Analysis of World GDP Dynamics: Kondratieff Waves, Kuznets Swings, Juglar and Kitchin Cycles in Global Economic Development, and the 2008–2009 Economic Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615181441/http://escholarship.org/uc/item/9jv108xp |date=2010-06-15 }}. ''Structure and Dynamics''. 2010. Vol. 4. no. 1. pp. 3–57.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Korotayev]] &amp; Tsirel also detected shorter business cycles, dating the Kuznets to about 17 years and calling it the third sub-harmonic of the Kondratiev, meaning that there are three Kuznets cycles per Kondratiev.{{technical statement|date=April 2014}}

===Cycles or fluctuations?===
In recent years economic theory has moved towards the study of ''economic fluctuation'' rather than a 'business cycle'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mankiw |first1=Gregory |year=1989 |title=Real Business Cycles: A New Keynesian Perspective |journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=79–90 |publisher=JSTOR |issn=0895-3309 |jstor=1942761 |doi=10.1257/jep.3.3.79}}&lt;/ref&gt; – though some economists use the phrase 'business cycle' as a convenient shorthand. For example, [[Milton Friedman]] said that calling the business cycle a "cycle" is a [[misnomer]], because of its non-cyclical nature. Friedman believed that for the most part, excluding very large supply shocks, business declines are more of a monetary phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Proposed explanations==
The explanation of fluctuations in aggregate economic activity is one of the primary concerns of [[macroeconomics]]. The main framework for explaining such fluctuations is [[Keynesian economics]]. In the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] view, business cycles reflect the possibility that the economy may reach short-run equilibrium at levels below or above [[full employment]]. If the economy is operating with less than full employment, i.e., with high [[unemployment]], Keynesian theory states that monetary policy and fiscal policy can have a positive role to play in smoothing the fluctuations of the business cycle.

Beside the Keynesian explanation there are a number of alternative theories of business cycles, largely associated with particular [[schools of economic thought|schools]] or theorists in [[heterodox economics]]. A common alternative within [[mainstream economics]] is [[real business cycle theory]]. Nowadays other notable theories are credit-based explanations such as [[debt deflation]] and the [[financial instability hypothesis]]. The latter two gained interest for being able to explain the subprime mortgage crisis and financial crises.

=== Exogenous vs. endogenous ===
Within mainstream economics, the debate over external (exogenous) versus internal (endogenous) being the causes of the economic cycles, with the classical school (now neo-classical) arguing for exogenous causes and the [[underconsumptionist]] (now Keynesian) school arguing for endogenous causes. These may also broadly be classed as "supply-side" and "demand-side" explanations: supply-side explanations may be styled, following [[Say's law]], as arguing that "[[supply creates its own demand]]", while demand-side explanations argue that [[effective demand]] may fall short of supply, yielding a recession or depression.

This debate has important policy consequences: proponents of exogenous causes of crises such as neoclassicals largely argue for minimal government policy or regulation ([[laissez faire]]), as absent these external shocks, the market functions, while proponents of endogenous causes of crises such as Keynesians largely argue for larger government policy and regulation, as absent regulation, the market will move from crisis to crisis. This division is not absolute – some classicals (including Say) argued for government policy to mitigate the damage of economic cycles, despite believing in external causes, while [[Austrian School]] economists argue against government involvement as only worsening crises, despite believing in internal causes.

The view of the economic cycle as caused exogenously dates to [[Say's law]], and much debate on endogeneity or exogeneity of causes of the economic cycle is framed in terms of refuting or supporting Say's law; this is also referred to as the "[[general glut]]" (supply in relation to demand) debate.

Until the [[Keynesian revolution]] in mainstream economics in the wake of the [[Great Depression]], classical and neoclassical explanations (exogenous causes) were the mainstream explanation of economic cycles; following the Keynesian revolution, neoclassical macroeconomics was largely rejected. There has been some resurgence of neoclassical approaches in the form of [[real business cycle]] (RBC) theory.  The debate between Keynesians and neo-classical advocates was reawakened following the recession of 2007.

Mainstream economists working in the [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] tradition, as opposed to the Keynesian tradition, have usually viewed the departures of the harmonic working of the market economy as due to exogenous influences, such as the State or its regulations, labor unions, business monopolies, or shocks due to technology or natural causes.

Contrarily, in the heterodox tradition of [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi]], [[Clement Juglar]], and [[Crisis theory|Marx]] the recurrent upturns and downturns of the market system are an endogenous characteristic of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morgan |first=Mary S. |authorlink=Mary S. Morgan |title=The History of Econometric Ideas |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1990 |isbn=0521373980 |pages=15–130 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUpDzJM9lq0C&amp;pg=PA15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th-century school of underconsumptionism also posited endogenous causes for the business cycle, notably the [[paradox of thrift]], and today this previously heterodox school has entered the mainstream in the form of [[Keynesian economics]] via the [[Keynesian revolution]].

===Keynesian===
According to [[Keynesian economics]], fluctuations in [[aggregate demand]] cause the economy to come to short run equilibrium at levels that are different from the full employment rate of output. These fluctuations express themselves as the observed business cycles. Keynesian models do not necessarily imply periodic business cycles. However, simple Keynesian models involving the interaction of the Keynesian multiplier and accelerator give rise to cyclical responses to initial shocks. [[Paul Samuelson]]'s "oscillator model"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Samuelson | first1 = P. A. | year = 1939 | title = Interactions between the multiplier analysis and the principle of acceleration | url = | journal = Review of Economic Statistics | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 75–78 | doi=10.2307/1927758| jstor = 1927758 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is supposed to account for business cycles thanks to the multiplier and the accelerator. The amplitude of the variations in economic output depends on the level of the investment, for investment determines the level of aggregate output (multiplier), and is determined by aggregate demand (accelerator).

In the Keynesian tradition, [[Richard M. Goodwin|Richard Goodwin]]&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Goodwin (1967) "A Growth Cycle", in C.H. Feinstein, editor, ''Socialism, Capitalism and Economic Growth''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; accounts for cycles in output by the distribution of income between business profits and workers' wages. The fluctuations in wages are almost the same as in the level of employment (wage cycle lags one period behind the employment cycle), for when the economy is at high employment, workers are able to demand rises in wages, whereas in periods of high unemployment, wages tend to fall. According to Goodwin, when unemployment and business profits rise, the output rises.

===Credit/debt cycle===
{{Main|Credit cycle|Debt deflation}}

One alternative theory is that the primary cause of economic cycles is due to the [[credit cycle]]: the net expansion of credit (increase in private credit, equivalently debt, as a percentage of GDP) yields economic expansions, while the net contraction causes recessions, and if it persists, depressions. In particular, the bursting of [[speculative bubble]]s is seen as the proximate cause of depressions, and this theory places finance and banks at the center of the business cycle.

A primary theory in this vein is the [[debt deflation]] theory of [[Irving Fisher]], which he proposed to explain the [[Great Depression]]. A more recent complementary theory is the [[Financial Instability Hypothesis]] of [[Hyman Minsky]], and the credit theory of economic cycles is often associated with [[Post-Keynesian economics]] such as [[Steve Keen]].

[[Post-Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesian]] economist [[Hyman Minsky]] has proposed an explanation of cycles founded on fluctuations in credit, interest rates and financial frailty, called the [[Financial Instability Hypothesis]]. In an expansion period, interest rates are low and companies easily borrow money from banks to invest. Banks are not reluctant to grant them loans, because expanding economic activity allows business increasing cash flows and therefore they will be able to easily pay back the loans. This process leads to firms becoming excessively indebted, so that they stop investing, and the economy goes into recession.

While credit causes have not been a primary theory of the economic cycle within the mainstream, they have gained occasional mention, such as {{Harv|Eckstein|Sinai|1986}}, cited approvingly by {{Harv|Summers|1986}}.

=== Real business cycle theory ===
{{Main|Real Business Cycle theory}}
Within mainstream economics, Keynesian views have been challenged by [[real business cycle]] models in which fluctuations are due to technology shocks. This theory is most associated with [[Finn E. Kydland]] and [[Edward C. Prescott]], and more generally the [[Chicago school of economics]] ([[freshwater economics]]). They consider that economic crisis and fluctuations cannot stem from a monetary shock, only from an external shock, such as an innovation.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

=== Product based theory of economic cycles ===
[[File:Product based theory of economic cycles.png|thumb|International product life cycle]]

This theory explains the nature and causes of economic cycles from the viewpoint of  life-cycle of marketable goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vernon | first1 = R. | year = 1966 | title = International Investment and International Trade in the Product Cycle | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Economics | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 22–26 | doi= 10.2307/1880689}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory originates from the work of  [[Raymond Vernon]], who described the development of international trade in terms of product life-cycle –  a period of time during which the product circulates in the market. Vernon stated that some countries specialize in the production and export of technologically new products, while others specialize in the production of already known products. The most developed countries are able to invest large amounts of money in the technological innovations and produce new products, thus obtaining a dynamic comparative advantage over developing countries.

Recent research by Georgiy Revyakin proves initial Vernon theory and shows that economic cycles in developed countries overrun economic cycles in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Revyakin | first1 = G. | year = 2017 | title = A new approach to the nature of economic cycles and their analysis in the global context | url = http://eu-jr.eu/social/article/view/425 | journal = Eureka: Social and Humanities | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 27–37 | doi = 10.21303/2504-5571.2017.00425 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171107030350/http://eu-jr.eu/social/article/view/425 | archivedate = 2017-11-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also presumes that economic cycles with different periodicity can be compared to the products with various life-cycles. In case of [[Kondratiev waves]] such products correlate with fundamental discoveries implemented in production (inventions which form the [[technological paradigm]]: Richard Arkwright's machines, steam engines, industrial use of electricity, computer invention, etc.);  [[Kuznets swing|Kuznets cycles]] describe such products as infrastructural components (roadways, transport, utilities, etc.); [[Juglar cycles]] may go in parallel with enterprise fixed capital (equipment, machinery, etc.), and  [[Kitchin cycle]]s are characterized by change in the society preferences (tastes) for [[consumer goods]], and time, which is necessary to start the production.

Simultaneous technological updates by all economic agents (as a result, cycle formation) would be determined by highly competitive market conditions: in case if a manufacturing technology at an enterprise does not meet the current technological environment, – such company loses its competitiveness and eventually goes bankrupt.

===Politically based business cycle===
Another set of models tries to derive the business cycle from political decisions. The ''partisan business cycle'' suggests that cycles result from the successive elections of administrations with different policy regimes. Regime A adopts expansionary policies, resulting in growth and inflation, but is voted out of office when inflation becomes unacceptably high. The replacement, Regime B, adopts contractionary policies reducing inflation and growth, and the downwards swing of the cycle. It is voted out of office when unemployment is too high, being replaced by Party A.

The political business cycle is an alternative theory stating that when an administration of any hue is elected, it initially adopts a contractionary policy to reduce inflation and gain a reputation for economic competence. It then adopts an expansionary policy in the lead up to the next election, hoping to achieve simultaneously low inflation and unemployment on election day.&lt;ref&gt;• Allan Drazen, 2008.

The political business cycle theory is strongly linked to the name of [[Michał Kalecki]] who discussed "the reluctance of the 'captains of industry' to accept government intervention in the matter of employment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kalecki|first=Michal|title=Political Aspects of Full Employment|url=http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2010/kalecki220510.html|accessdate=2 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407014237/http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2010/kalecki220510.html|archivedate=7 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Persistent [[full employment]] would mean increasing workers' bargaining power to raise wages and to avoid doing unpaid labor, potentially hurting profitability. (He did not see this theory as applying under [[fascism]], which would use direct force to destroy labor's power.) In recent years, proponents of the "electoral business cycle" theory{{who|date=April 2013}} have argued that incumbent politicians encourage prosperity before elections in order to ensure re-election – and make the citizens pay for it with recessions afterwards.

===Marxian economics===
For Marx the economy based on production of commodities to be sold in the market is intrinsically prone to [[Crisis (Marxian)|crisis]]. In the [[Heterodox economics|heterodox]] Marxian view profit is the major engine of the market economy, but business (capital) profitability has a [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall|tendency to fall]] that recurrently creates crises, in which mass unemployment occurs, businesses fail, remaining capital is centralized and concentrated and profitability is recovered. In the long run these crises tend to be more severe and the system will eventually fail.&lt;ref&gt;Henryk Grossmann ''Das Akkumulations – und Zusammenbruchsgesetz des kapitalistischen Systems (Zugleich eine Krisentheorie)'', Hirschfeld, Leipzig, 1929&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Marxist authors such as [[Rosa Luxemburg]] viewed the lack of purchasing power of workers as a cause of a tendency of supply to be larger than demand, creating crisis, in a model that has similarities with the Keynesian one. Indeed, a number of modern authors have tried to combine Marx's and Keynes's views. [[Henryk Grossman]]&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Henryk The Law of Accumulation and Breakdown of the Capitalist System. Pluto&lt;/ref&gt; reviewed the debates and the counteracting tendencies and [[Paul Mattick]] subsequently emphasized the basic differences between the Marxian and the Keynesian perspective: while Keynes saw capitalism as a system worth maintaining and susceptible to efficient regulation, Marx viewed capitalism as a historically doomed system that cannot be put under societal control.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Mattick, ''Marx and Keynes: The Limits of Mixed Economy'', Boston, Porter Sargent, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

The American mathematician and economist, [[Richard M. Goodwin]] formalised a Marxist model of business cycles, known as the [[Goodwin Model]] in which recession was caused by increased bargaining power of workers (a result of high employment in boom periods) pushing up the wage share of national income, suppressing profits and leading to a breakdown in [[capital accumulation]]. Later theorists applying variants of the Goodwin model have identified both short and long period profit-led growth and distribution cycles in the United States, and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barbosa-Filho | first1 = Nelson H. | last2 = Taylor | first2 = Lance | year = 2006 | title = Distributive and Demand Cycles in the US Economy – A Structuralist Goodwin Model | url = | journal = Metroeconomica | volume = 57 | issue = 3| pages = 389–411 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-999x.2006.00250.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Flaschel, G.

===Austrian School===
{{Main|Austrian business cycle theory}}
Economists of the heterodox [[Austrian School]] argue that business cycles are caused by excessive issuance of credit by banks in [[fractional reserve banking]] systems. According to Austrian economists, excessive issuance of bank credit may be exacerbated if [[central bank]] monetary policy sets interest rates too low, and the resulting expansion of the money supply causes a "boom" in which resources are misallocated or [[malinvestment|"malinvested"]] because of artificially low interest rates. Eventually, the boom cannot be sustained and is followed by a "bust" in which the malinvestments are liquidated  (sold for less than their original cost) and the money supply contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Block|first1=Walter|last2=Garschina|first2=Kenneth|title=Hayek, Business Cycles  and Fractional Reserve  Banking: Continuing  the De-Homogenization Process|url=https://mises.org/journals/rae/pdf/rae9_1_3.pdf|website=www.mises.org|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|accessdate=28 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910205248/http://mises.org/journals/rae/pdf/RAE9_1_3.pdf|archivedate=10 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shostak|first1=Dr. Frank|title=Fractional Reserve banking and boom-bust cycles|url=https://mises.org/journals/scholar/shostak2.pdf|website=www.mises.org|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|accessdate=28 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714030329/http://mises.org/journals/scholar/shostak2.pdf|archivedate=14 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the criticisms of the [[Austrian business cycle theory#Criticisms|Austrian business cycle theory]] is based on the observation that the United States suffered recurrent economic crises in the 19th century, notably the [[Panic of 1873]], which occurred prior to the establishment of a U.S. central bank in 1913.  Adherents of the Austrian School, such as the historian [[Thomas Woods]], argue that these earlier financial crises were prompted by government and bankers' efforts to expand credit despite restraints imposed by the prevailing gold standard, and are thus consistent with [[Austrian Business Cycle Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woods Jr.|first1=Thomas|title=Can We Live Without the Fed?|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/woods/woods219.html|website=www.lewrockwell.com|publisher=Lew Rockwell|accessdate=27 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313212821/http://archive.lewrockwell.com/woods/woods219.html|archivedate=13 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woods Jr.|first1=Thomas|title=Economic Cycles Before the Fed|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxcjT8T3EGU|website=www.youtube.com|publisher=Mises Media|accessdate=27 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912194610/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxcjT8T3EGU|archivedate=12 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian explanation of the business cycle differs significantly from the [[mainstream economics|mainstream]] understanding of business cycles and is generally rejected by mainstream economists. Mainstream economists generally do not support Austrian school explanations for business cycles, on both theoretical as well as real-world empirical grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Milton.

=== Yield curve ===
The slope of the [[yield curve]] is one of the most powerful predictors of future economic growth, inflation, and recessions.&lt;ref&gt;Arturo Estrella &amp; Frederic S. Mishkin, ''[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/003465398557320?journalCode=rest The Review of Economics &amp; Statistics, Predicting U.S. Recessions: Financial Variables as Leading Indicators]'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  One measure of the yield curve slope (i.e. the difference between 10-year Treasury bond rate and the 3-month Treasury bond rate) is included in the [http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/STLFSI Financial Stress Index] published by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|St. Louis Fed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Data Series Used to Construct the St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index|url=https://www.stlouisfed.org/news-releases/st-louis-fed-financial-stress-index/stlfsi-key|publisher=The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|accessdate=2 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402151924/https://www.stlouisfed.org/news-releases/st-louis-fed-financial-stress-index/stlfsi-key|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A different measure of the slope (i.e. the difference between 10-year Treasury bond rates and the [[federal funds rate]]) is incorporated into the [[Conference Board Leading Economic Index|Index of Leading Economic Indicators]] published by [[The Conference Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Description of Components|url=http://www.conference-board.org/data/bci/index.cfm?id=2160|website=Business Cycle Indicators|publisher=The Conference Board|accessdate=2 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402203219/http://www.conference-board.org/data/bci/index.cfm?id=2160|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An inverted yield curve is often a harbinger of [[recession]].  A positively sloped yield curve is often a harbinger of [[inflation]]ary growth.  Work by Arturo Estrella and Tobias Adrian has established the predictive power of an inverted yield curve to signal a recession.  Their models show that when the difference between short-term interest rates (they use 3-month T-bills) and long-term interest rates (10-year Treasury bonds) at the end of a federal reserve tightening cycle is negative or less than 93 basis points positive that a rise in unemployment usually occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Arturo Estrella and Tobias Adrian, ''[http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr397.pdf FRB of New York Staff Report No. 397] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906031016/http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr397.pdf |date=2015-09-06 }}'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York|New York Fed]] publishes a [http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/capital_markets/ycfaq.html monthly recession probability prediction] derived from the yield curve and based on Estrella's work.

All the recessions in the US since 1970 (up through 2017) have been preceded by an inverted yield curve (10-year vs 3-month).  Over the same time frame, every occurrence of an inverted yield curve has been followed by recession as declared by the [[National Bureau of Economic Research|NBER]] business cycle dating committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Announcement Dates|url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/|website=US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions|publisher=NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee|accessdate=1 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012231548/https://www.nber.org/cycles/|archivedate=12 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estrella and others have postulated that the yield curve affects the business cycle via the balance sheet of banks (or [[Shadow banking system|bank-like financial institutions]]).&lt;ref&gt;Arturo Estrella, ''[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1532309 FRB of New York Staff Report No. 421] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061128/http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1532309 |date=2013-09-21 }}'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  When the yield curve is inverted banks are often caught paying more on short-term deposits (or [[Repurchase agreement|other forms]] of short-term wholesale funding) than they are making on long-term loans leading to a loss of profitability and reluctance to lend resulting in a [[credit crunch]].  When the yield curve is upward sloping, banks can profitably take-in short term deposits and make long-term loans so they are eager to supply credit to borrowers. This eventually leads to a [[Economic bubble|credit bubble]].

===Georgism===
[[Henry George]] claimed land price fluctuations were the primary cause of most business cycles.&lt;ref&gt;George, Henry. (1881). ''Progress and Poverty: An Inquiry into the Cause of Industrial Depressions and of Increase of Want with Increase of Wealth; The Remedy''. Kegan Paul (reissued by [[Cambridge University Press]], 2009; {{ISBN|978-1108003612}})&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory is generally discounted by modern mainstream economists.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Alvin H. ''Business Cycles and National Income''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1964, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigating an economic downturn==
Many social indicators, such as mental health, crimes, and suicides, worsen during economic recessions (though general mortality tends to fall, and it is in expansions when it tends to increase).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ruhm | first1 = C | year = 2000 | title = Are Recessions Good for Your Health? | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Economics | volume = 115 | issue = 2| pages = 617–650 | doi=10.1162/003355300554872}}&lt;/ref&gt; As periods of economic stagnation are painful for the many who lose their jobs, there is often political pressure for governments to mitigate recessions. Since the 1940s, following the [[Keynesian revolution]], most governments of developed nations have seen the mitigation of the business cycle as part of the responsibility of government, under the rubric of [[stabilization policy]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Since in the Keynesian view, recessions are caused by inadequate aggregate demand, when a recession occurs the government should increase the amount of aggregate demand and bring the economy back into equilibrium.  This the government can do in two ways, firstly by increasing the money supply (expansionary [[monetary policy]]) and secondly by increasing government spending or cutting taxes (expansionary fiscal policy).

By contrast, some economists, notably [[New classical economics|New classical economist]] [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]], argue that the [[welfare cost of business cycles]] are very small to negligible, and that governments should focus on long-term growth instead of stabilization.

However, even according to [[Keynesian theory]], managing [[economic policy]] to smooth out the cycle is a difficult task in a society with a complex economy. Some theorists, notably those who believe in [[Marxian economics]], believe that this difficulty is insurmountable. [[Karl Marx]] claimed that recurrent [[Crises (economic)|business cycle crises]] were an inevitable result of the operations of the [[capitalism|capitalistic system]]. In this view, all that the government can do is to change the ''timing'' of economic crises. The crisis could also show up in a different ''form'', for example as severe [[inflation]] or a steadily increasing [[deficit spending|government deficit]]. Worse, by delaying a crisis, government policy is seen as making it ''more dramatic'' and thus more painful.

Additionally, since the 1960s [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical economists]] have played down the ability of Keynesian policies to manage an economy.  Since the 1960s, economists like Nobel Laureates [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Edmund Phelps]] have made ground in their arguments that inflationary expectations negate the [[Phillips curve]] in the long run.  The [[1973–75 recession|stagflation of the 1970s]] provided striking support for their theories while proving a dilemma for Keynesian policies, which appeared to necessitate both expansionary policies to mitigate recession and contractionary policies to reduce inflation.
Friedman has gone so far as to argue that all the [[central bank]] of a country should do is to avoid making large mistakes, as he believes they did by contracting the money supply very rapidly in the face of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], in which they made what would have been a recession into the [[Great Depression]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

{{Accounting}}
'''Certified Management Accountant''' ('''CMA''') is a [[professional certification]] credential in the [[management accounting]] and [[financial management]] fields. The certification signifies that the person possesses knowledge in the areas of [[financial planning]], analysis, control, decision support, and professional ethics. The CMA is a U.S.-based, globally recognized certification offered by the [[Institute of Management Accountants]].

CMA-certified professionals work inside organizations of all sizes, industries, and types, including manufacturing and services, public and private enterprises, not-for-profit organizations, academic institutions, government entities, and multinational corporations. To date, more than 50,000 CMAs have been certified in more than 100 countries.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} To obtain certification, candidates must pass a rigorous exam, meet an educational requirement, experience requirement, and demonstrate a commitment to continuous learning through [[Continuing professional development|continuing professional education (CPE)]].

==The Certified Management Accountant Exam==


The Certified Management Accountant Exam is a two part exam that must be passed as a prerequisite to earning the CMA designation. Candidates are given three years from registering to pass both parts of the exam. The exams are given during three testing window periods: January/February, May/June and September/October at [[Prometric]] centers. 

Prior to 2010, the CMA exam was organized into four parts: Business Analysis, Management Accounting and Reporting, Strategic Management. Since 2010, the exam has been condensed into two four-hour parts, covering largely the same material as the former four part exam with added emphasis on financial planning, analysis, control, and decision support.

Each exam consists of descriptive questions and two 30-minute essay questions. Candidates are given 3 hours to complete the multiple choice section and one hour to complete the essays. Candidates must show their work for the essay questions in order to receive credit.  Parts 1 and 2 of the CMA exam are scored on a scale of 0-500 with a candidate's raw score converted to a uniform scaled score against all exam candidates. On this scale, a score of 360 represents the minimum passing scaled score. 

===Exam Content===
''Part 1 – Financial Reporting, Planning, Performance, and Control''
* External financial reporting decisions (15%)
* Planning, budgeting and forecasting (30%)
* Performance management (20%)
* Cost management (20%)
* Internal controls (15%)

''Part 2 – Financial Decision Making''
* Financial statement analysis (25%)
* Corporate finance (20%)
* Decision analysis (20%)
* Risk management (10%)
* Investment decisions (15%)

The exam is considered very rigorous and pass rates for the CMA exam have historically been low for both parts. Worldwide, the exam had a pass rate of 35% for Part 1 and 49% for Part 2 in 2014.

{{Slavery}}

'''Child slavery''' is the [[slavery]] of [[child]]ren. The enslavement of children can be traced back through history. Even after the [[Abolitionism|abolition]] of slavery, children continue to be enslaved and trafficked in modern times, which is a particular problem in developing countries.

==History==
Child slavery refers to the slavery of children below the [[age of majority]]. In the past, many children have been sold into slavery in order for their family to repay debts or crimes or earn some money if the family were short of cash. A scholar retold a story about a mother where, "her predicament shattered the privilege of thinking of her children in purely personal and sentimental terms and caused her to consider whether outsiders might find value in them". Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote about a woman who was bought by a slave owner to breed children for him to sell.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephenson|first1=Mimosa|title=Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin: An Argument for Protection of the Family|journal=Journal of the American Studies Association of Texas|date=November 2011|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expectations of children who were either bought or born into slavery varied. Scholars noted, "age and physical capacity, as well as the degree of dependence, set the terms of children's integration into households".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The duties that child slaves were responsible for performing are disputed amongst scholars. A few representations of the lives that slave children led portrayed them as, "virtually divorced from the plantation economy until they were old enough to be employed as field hands, thereby emphasizing the carefree nature of childhood for a part of the slave population that was temporarily spared forced labor".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This view also stated that if children were asked to perform any duties at all, it was to perform light household chores, such as being "organized into 'trash gangs' and made to collect refuse about the estate".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Pargas|first1 = Damian|title = From the Cradle to the Fields: Slave Childcare and Childhood in the Antebellum South|journal = Slavery &amp; Abolition|date = December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposing scholars argued that slave children had their youth stolen from them, and were forced to start performing adult duties at a very young age.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Some say that children were forced to perform field labor duties as young as the age of six.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It is argued that in some areas children were put to "regular work in the antebellum South" and it "was a time when slaves began to learn work routines, but also work discipline and related punishment".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = From the Cradle to the Fields: Slave Childcare and Childhood in the Antebellum Plantation South|last = Pargas|first = Damian Alan|date = December 2011|journal = Slavery &amp; Abolition|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A degree of self-possession was present in some degree to adults, but "children retained the legal incapacities of dependence even after they had become productive members of households".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Catherine|title=Ties That Bind, Bonds That Break: Children in the Reorganization of Households in Postemancipation Virginia|journal=Journal of Southern History|date=February 2010|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported by scholars that, "this distinctive status shaped children's standing within familial households and left them subject to forced apprenticeship, even after emancipation".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; There were slave owners who did not want child slaves or women who were pregnant for fear that the child would have "took up too much of her time".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

The conditions of slavery for pregnant women varied regionally. In most cases, women worked in the fields up until childbirth performing small tasks. "four weeks appears to have been the average confinement period, or 'lying-in period', for antebellum slave women following delivery in the South as a whole".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Slaveholders in northern Virginia, however, usually only permitted an average lying-in period of about "two weeks before ordering new mothers back to work".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The responsibility of raising and tending to the children then became the task of other children and older elderly slaves. In most institutions of slavery throughout the world, the children of slaves became the property of the owner. This created a constant supply of people to perform labor. This was the case with, for example, [[thrall]]s and [[History of slavery in the United States|American slaves]]. In other cases, children were enslaved as if they were adults. Usually, the status of the mother determined if the child was a slave, but some local laws varied the decision to the father. In many cultures, slaves could earn their freedom through hard work and buying their own freedom.{{Cn|date=October 2018}}

==Modern day==
Although the [[Abolitionism|abolition of slavery]] in much of the world has greatly reduced child slavery, the problem lives on, especially in [[Developing country|developing countries]]. According to the [[Anti-Slavery Society]], "Although there is no longer any state which legally recognizes, or which will enforce, a claim by a person to a right of property over another, the abolition of slavery does not mean that it ceased to exist. There are millions of people throughout the world—mainly children—in conditions of virtual to slavery."&lt;ref name="antislaverysociety"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anti-slaverysociety.org/slavery.htm |title=Does Slavery Still Exist? |accessdate=2008-01-04 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=Anti-Slavery Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; It further notes that slavery, particularly child slavery, was on the rise in 2003. It points out that there are countless others in other forms of servitude (such as [[peonage]], bonded labor and servile [[concubinage]]) which are not slavery in the narrow legal sense. Critics claim they are stretching the definition and practice of slavery beyond its original meaning, and are actually referring to forms of [[unfree labour]] other than slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Routledge Handbook of Global Child Welfare|last=Pat Dolan, Nick Frost|first=|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2017|isbn=9781317374749|location=|pages=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Voluntarism: Human Rights and the Developing International Legal Obligations of Companies|last=|first=|publisher=ICHRP|year=2002|isbn=9782940259199|location=|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, reports of slavery came out of Bahr al Ghazal, a Dinka region in southern Sudan. In 1995, Dinka mothers spoke about their abducted children. Roughly 20,000 slaves were reported in Sudan in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miniter|first=Richard|title=The False Promise of Slave Redemption|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/99jul/9907sudanslaves.htm|accessdate=July 2000|newspaper=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The handmade woolen carpet industry is extremely labor intensive and one of the largest export earners for India, Pakistan, Nepal and Morocco." During the past 20 years,{{clarify timeframe|date=December 2016}} about 200,000 and 300,000 children are involved, most of them in the carpet belt of Uttar Pradesh in central India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Labor in the Carpet Industry|url=http://www.anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/carpets.htm|work=Anti-Slavery Society|accessdate=April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many children in Asia are kidnapped or trapped in servitude, where they work in factories and workshops for no pay and receive constant beatings.&lt;ref name=antislaverysociety /&gt; Slaves have reappeared following the old slave trade routes in West Africa. "The children are kidnapped or purchased for $20–$70 each in poorer states, such as Benin and Togo, and sold into slavery in sex dens or as unpaid domestic servants for $350.00 each in wealthier oil-rich states, such as Nigeria and Gabon."&lt;ref name=antislaverysociety /&gt;

===Trafficking===
{{Main|Trafficking of children}}
Trafficking of children includes recruiting, harbouring, obtaining, and transporting children by use of force or [[fraud]] for the purpose of subjecting them to involuntary acts, such as commercial sexual exploitation (including [[Prostitution of children|prostitution]]) or [[unfree labour|involuntary labour]], i.e., [[enslavement]]. Some see human trafficking as the [[modern slavery|modern form of slavery]]. Human trafficking is the trade of human beings and their use by criminals to make money. The majority of trafficking victims are adults, predominantly made up of women forced into prostitution (although men are trafficked also), but children make up a significant number of the victims forced into prostitution.

In [[Ukraine]], a survey conducted by the [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) La Strada-Ukraine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brama.com/lastrada/|title=La Strada Ukraine|website=www.brama.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2001–2003, based on a sample of 106 women being [[trafficked]] out of Ukraine found that 3% were under 18, and the US [[State Department]] reported in 2004 that incidents of minors being trafficked was increasing. In [[Thailand]], NGOs have estimated that up to a third of prostitutes are children under 18, many trafficked from outside Thailand.&lt;ref name="uncjri"&gt;[http://www.unicri.it/wwd/trafficking/minors/countries.php UN Crime and Justice Research Institution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051024072431/http://www.unicri.it/wwd/trafficking/minors/countries.php |date=2005-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations [[Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography]] estimates that about one million children in Asia alone are victims of the [[sex trade]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecpatusa.org/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], [[Save the Children]], [[World Vision]] and the [[British Red Cross]] have called for an immediate halt to adoptions of Haitian children not approved before the earthquake, warning that child traffickers could exploit the lack of regulation. An [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] spokesman said that child enslavement and trafficking was "an existing problem and could easily emerge as a serious issue over the coming weeks and months".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6999280.ece Call for halt to Haiti adoptions over traffickers], [[The Times]], January 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child soldiers===
{{Main|Military use of children}}
In 2007, Human Rights Watch estimated that 200,000 to 300,000 children served as soldiers in current conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Staff.

===Forced labor===
More girls under 16 work as [[Domestic worker#Child domestic workers|domestic worker]]s than any other category of child labor, often sent to cities by parents living in rural poverty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/25/AR2008122501198.html?wprss=rss_print/asection&amp;sid=ST2008122600004|title=In Togo, a 10-Year-Old's Muted Cry: 'I Couldn't Take Any More'|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as in [[restavek]]s in Haiti.

The '''Competition Authority''' ('''TCA''') was responsible for enforcing Irish and European [[competition law]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and promoting competition in the economy. In 2014 it was amalgamated with the [[National Consumer Agency]] to form the [[Competition and Consumer Protection Commission]].

==Purpose and powers==
Consumers were at the core of the Competition Authority's work. Its aim was to make sure that competition worked for the benefit of all consumers who bought products and services in Ireland.  This included businesses, the State and its agents, as well as individuals.

It had the power to investigate if there was evidence that businesses were involved in anti-competitive practices, such as [[price-fixing]], or that businesses were abusing a dominant position.  It could also block mergers between businesses that would substantially reduce competition and harm consumers.

The Authority also had a very broad role to promote competition in the economy. They did this by calling for reform when Irish laws, regulations or actions by State bodies restrict competition.  They advised Government and its agents on how proposed legislation or regulations could affect competition. This prevented future problems for consumers. This helped to give a voice to consumers when it came to public policy-making. They also promoted competition by telling public authorities and the public about the benefits of competition.

==Operations==
The Authority operated under the [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2002_14.html Competition Act 2002] and was funded via a grant from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.

The authority was divided into six divisions: [[Cartels]], [[Monopolies]], Advocacy, Mergers, Strategy and Corporate Services. The Authority was a collegiate body, consisting of four full-time members, who each headed one or more divisions, appointed following an open competition by the Public Appointments Service.

The former Members of the Authority were Chairperson Isolde Goggin and Members Stephen Calkins, Gerald FitzGerald and Patrick Kenny.

==Amalgamation==
In November 2008, the Government announced the amalgamation of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency as part of a rationalisation of State agencies. On 31 March 2014 the Competition and Consumer Protection Bill was published.  On 31 July Richard Bruton, TD, Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation announced that the legislation would commence and the new Competition and Consumer Protection Commission would be established on 31 October 2014.

The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer law. Both organisations continued to perform their statutory functions until the merger was given effect on 31 October 2014.

The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is currently governed by an executive Chair and Membership structure.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Act, 2014 allows for a Chair and between two and six Members.

The former Chair of the Competition Authority, Isolde Goggin, was appointed Chairperson of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission on taking up her former role in 2011. Ms Goggin is supported in her role by the Members of the new Commission which include the two former Members of the Competition Authority, Fergal O'Leary and Patrick Kenny, and the former Chief Executive of the National Consumer Agency, Karen O'Leary, all of whom were appointed Members-designate of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation upon taking up their current positions.

'''''Data Driven Nonprofits''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Steve MacLaughlin]]. The book was published on August 3, 2016 by Saltire Press. In the text, MacLaughlin argues that data should be a valuable asset that enriches nonprofits and helps them grow. Instead, many get overwhelmed by the flood of data, fail to maintain it, or choose to ignore it altogether."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/book-review-anecdotal-guide-better-use-data/digital/article/1410230 |work=Third Sector |date=September 30, 2016 |title=Book Review: An anecdotal guide to better use of data }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
MacLaughlin opens the book with a series of historical tales about early fundraising efforts, but soon gets to the here and now, and he doesn’t pull punches about the current state of data use in the nonprofit sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fundraising.co.uk/2016/09/06/review-data-driven-nonprofits/ |work=Fundraising UK |date=September 6, 2016 |title=REVIEW: Data Driven Nonprofits }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rest of ''Data Driven Nonprofits'' can easily be divided into two sections. The short first section consisting of a fact-filled journey through history and the current data climate today, looking at where we’ve been with data collection and where we are now. The second, and longer, section of the book breaks out some of the challenges nonprofit organizations will face as they try to use data in their overall strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://modernadvancement.com/news/data-drive-nonprofits-review/ |work=Modern Advancement |date=November 14, 2016 |title=Book Review: Data Drive Nonprofits by Steve MacLaughlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''Data Driven Nonprofits'' went on to be listed as a #1 Best Seller in Nonprofit Organizations &amp; Charities on [[Amazon.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=978-0988850712|title=Data Driven Nonprofits |publisher=Saltire Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Roger Craver]] of ''The Agitator'' reviewed the book and noted: "''Data Driven Nonprofits'' is must reading, because it will not only change your mind, it will inspire you — by fact and example — to start measuring the right things for the right outcomes, and begin experiencing real growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Craver|first=Roger|title=A New Fundraising Classic|url=http://www.theagitator.net/nonprofit-management/a-new-fundraising-classic/|newspaper=The Agitator|date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Third Sector'' commented: "The book has an easy, anecdotal style and some persuasive arguments. It should be useful to anyone struggling to use data more intelligently after the batch-and-blast methods that contributed to recent fundraising scandals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/book-review-anecdotal-guide-better-use-data/digital/article/1410230 |work=Third Sector |date=September 30, 2016 |title=Book Review: An anecdotal guide to better use of data }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fundraising UK'' noted that "as a fundraiser’s guide to the power of strategic data use over tribal learning – it’s a handy addition to the bookshelf." The review also went on to say that "more importantly it provides case studies from a range of nonprofits (a handful of which are from the UK).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fundraising.co.uk/2016/09/06/review-data-driven-nonprofits/ |work=Fundraising UK |date=September 6, 2016 |title=REVIEW: Data Driven Nonprofits }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken Burnett, fundraising expert and author of ''Relationship Fundraising'' said, "here in ''Data Driven Nonprofits'' we have fundraising’s modern-day equivalent of Moses in the wilderness telling us that we are failing our beneficiaries, our donors, our colleagues and ourselves because as a sector, almost since fundraising began, we’ve not invested properly or wisely in data and analytics...Then, from his viewpoint – perhaps the best possible vantage point in our entire industry – Steve sets out, step by step, precisely what we should do to change that."

'''Diatto''' was an Italian manufacturing company founded in 1835 in [[Turin]] by Guglielmo Diatto to make 'carriages for wealthy customers'. In 1874 Guglielmo’s sons, Giovanni and Battista Diatto, began building [[railway carriage]]s for [[Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits]] and the [[Orient Express]]. In 1905 Guglielmo's grandsons, Vittorio and Pietro Diatto, began Diatto-Clément, a cooperative venture making motor-vehicles under license from French manufacturer [[Clément-Bayard]] owned by industrialist [[Adolphe Clément-Bayard]]. By 1909 they had full ownership of 'Autocostruzioni Diatto' and began developing their own motor-vehicles and exporting them worldwide.

From 1905 the company built two and four cylinder cars based on the [[Clément-Bayard]], a leading contemporary French manufacturer.  By the 1920s, Diatto was making quality cars of its own design, including race cars with supercharged eight-cylinder engines.  Diatto also supplied frames to [[Bugatti]] which used them for their own race cars.  Some Diatto racers were prepared and raced by [[Alfieri Maserati]] who left Diatto in 1926 to establish the [[Maserati]] marque with his brothers.

Diatto cars were known for their innovative engineering and as early as the 1920s they were equipped with four-wheel brakes and four-speed [[gearbox]]es.

Diatto ceased production in 1929.

==History==

===19th century===
In 1835 Guglielmo Diatto, a 30-year-old [[wheelwright]] from [[Carmagnola]], founded a workshop on the banks of the [[river Po]] in [[Turin]] for the manufacture and repair of carriage wheels. The business developed into building carriages for nobility and Diatto Manifattura di Carrozze (Carriage Manufacture) became a successful industrial concern.&lt;ref name="DiaHist"&gt;[http://www.diatto.it/EN/pagine/company2.html www.diatto.it. Diatto History]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838 Guglielmo Diatto was awarded his first patent for a 'perfected wheel'. The patent is held at the 'National Museum of Automobiles' in Turin.

In 1874 the founder’s sons, Giovanni and Battista, began building luxury [[railway carriage]]s for [[Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits|Compagnie des Wagons Lits et des Grands Express Europeens]] of Paris who ran the ''[[Orient Express]]'', the ''[[Nord Express]]'', the ''[[Sud Express]]'' and the ''Transsibérien'' across Russia.

===Diatto-Clément===
In 1905 the grandsons of the founder, Vittorio and Pietro Diatto, believed that motor-vehicle production represented the future for the 'carriage market'. On 12 April 1905, they founded the [[Diatto-Clément|Società Diatto-A. Clement]] in partnership with the French company [[Clément-Bayard]], owned by [[Adolphe Clément-Bayard]] of Paris. Diatto-Clément had a workforce of 500 (Note: Fiat had  776) and produced cars with 4 and 6 cylinder engines.

The company achieved significant sporting success from the outset.  In 1906 it won the Herkomer Competition in Germany against 134 competitors (1800&amp;nbsp;km from Frankfurt to Innsbruk); the [[Lugano]]-[[San Gottardo]] (speed trial over 7 hours through the mountain passes) in Switzerland; and the Italian Gold Cup, defeating 48 competitors over 4000&amp;nbsp;km in 11 daily stages across Italy.

It also won the 1907 [[Cannes]] Cup, for fuel economy and the 1908 [[Saint Petersburg]]-[[Moscow]] 700&amp;nbsp;km race.

===Autocostruzioni Diatto===
In 1909 the Diatto brothers bought out Adolphe Clément-Bayard and renamed the company 'Autocostruzioni Diatto'. The new company continued with its sporting reputation and traded on the slogan : ''Queen of lightweight vehicles, fast, comfortable, elegant''.

The company developed a worldwide sales and support network, with vehicles being exported to :

From 1912 onwards Diatto expanded rapidly, becoming one of the top Italian industrial groups. In 1915, it acquired both the Scacchi factory in [[Chivasso]], in which the workforce of 100 built five cars per month,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The Scacchi factory in Chivasso had been founded in 1911 by Cesare Scacchi, previously a workshop supervisor at Fiat.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 'Vetture Automobili Leggere Torino' (V.A.L.T.) factory.[[:de:Vetture Automobili Leggere Torino]]&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The 'Vetture Automobili Leggere Torino' (V.A.L.T.) factory was built in 1911, and after the Diatto stripping of workforce and plant it was acquired by the British industrialist John Newton.&lt;/ref&gt; It then consolidated both the workforces and plant in the new factory in 'Via Frejus' (Turin) where they were able to produce over 40 units a month.

====Gnome et Rhône====
Diatto acquired a controlling share of the leading aviation engine manufacturer [[Gnome et Rhône]] from 'Weiter and Waugham'. Gnome manufactured around 200 [[Rotary engine|rotary]] aviation engines per month. Under Diatto ownership their technological know-how was also integrated into the motor-vehicles.

The Gnome et  Rhone 9 cylinder rotary engine won several prestigious trans-European prizes such as the Mediterranean crossing; the Gordon Bennet Cup; the Reims Meeting; plus the Raids of Friedrichshafen, Düsseldorf, Cuxhaven, Zeebrugge, and Dunkerque.{{Elucidate|Were Raids competitions or military?|March 2012|date=March 2012}}
The build-up to World War 1 lead to orders for 5,000 aviation engines for Italy, Russia, France and United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Motori, Aero, Cicli &amp; Sports, 1915–1919): ''The most illuminated science and the greatest experience in automotive and aviation mechanics''&lt;/ref&gt;

====1920s====
After the first world war they added 8 cylinder supercharged engines with aluminium pistons and 4 valves per cylinder, up to 6,000 cc.

==Revival of the marque==
On 9 February 2007 [[Zagato]] announced the revival of the Diatto marque to celebrate its 100th anniversary. At the 77th [[Geneva Motor Show]] in March 2007 it unveiled a new all-aluminum sports car called the [[Diatto Ottovù Zagato]].

==Sporting victories, Palmares==
Diatto-Clement competition victories included:
* 1906 Herkomer Competition, Germany,  against 134 competitors (1800&amp;nbsp;km from Frankfurt to Innsbruk);
* 1906 [[Lugano]]-[[San Gottardo]] (speed trial over 7 hours through the mountain passes) in Switzerland; 
* 1906 Italian Gold Cup, defeating 48 competitors over 4000&amp;nbsp;km in 11 daily stages across Italy.
* 1907 [[Cannes]] Cup, for fuel economy 
* 1908 [[Saint Petersburg]]-[[Moscow]] 700&amp;nbsp;km race.

Autocostruzioni Diatto competition victories included :
* 1909 Italy - [[Modena]] “Mile record”;
* 1910 UK - [[Brooklands]];
* 1913 Italy - [[Parma]]-[[Berceto|Poggio di Berceto]] (the Race to the mountain);
* 1914 Spain - [[Barcelona]] “Rebassada Cup”; 
* 1914 France - “Tourist Cup” (3120&amp;nbsp;km, economy and efficiency prizes with the lowest fuel consumption);

'''Under Construction'''

{{Cleanup|date=April 2011}}

=='''''Under Construction''''' - Old text==
Old Text waiting to be carefully extracted into main article above.

This 'Old Text' that was inserted by an apparently non-native speaker of English. It appears to be machine translated. It was simply added (dumped) by a new URL, overwriting a small article. This version is templated for Cleanup and Wikify and a few piecemeal attempts have been made by editors, but it needs to be selectively edited into a well structured main article (i.e. see above) - the amorphous text and lists below are not realistically cleanable.  All detail appears to be machine translated from Italian Wiki page which is heavily based on the Diatto  website, but it must be anglicised, structured and referenced.  All (my) subsequent edits will be enhancements to the original article using concepts from the unreferenced text below, plus searching for citations.

===History===

====Gnome et Rhone====
- Diatto also acquires a controlling share in the Italian engine manufacturer "Gnome &amp; Rhone", the most important maker of aviation engines (200 per month) and owner of the patent for fighter-plane-rotary engines, and transfers its sophisticated technology to automotive production.
- With its 9 cylinder rotary engines, Gnome &amp; Rhone (Diatto owned), win the most prestigious cross-European prizes:
- The Mediterranean crossing, the Gordon Bennet Cup, the Reims Meeting, the Raids of Friedrichshafen, Düsseldorf, Cuxhaven, Zeebrugge, Dunkerque.
- Success and fame enable the company, at the outbreak of the Great War, to win enormous orders from around Europe: 5,000 aviation engines for Italy, Russia, France and England.
- (Source, Motori, Aero, Cicli &amp; Sports, 1915–1919): "The most illuminated science and the greatest experience in automotive and aviation mechanics”.

====Royal Family====
- 1907-1927-Diatto is the official supplier to the Italian Royal Family.
- Thanks to its avant-garde technology and design, DIATTO conquers the favour of the Italian Royal Family - customer from 1907 - who, in 1910, purchases 4 vehicles, of which one is a sports car (source, Italian magazine MACS, February 1911), trust and confidence that will continue for 20 years, until 1927 (Registration document - 1927 - of a DIATTO belonging to the His Majesty the King of Italy is conserved in National Museum Automobile – Turin).
- The family of the future champion and constructor Enzo Ferrari also becomes a DIATTO client.
- Diatto cars were known for their innovative design and engineering.

====1919-1932-First class design and performance====
- The most famous designers in the world use DIATTO bodywork: Bertone, Castagna, Garavini, Ghia, Mulliner, Schieppati, Stabilimenti Farina, Zagato. From the press at the time: “The classic design of the DIATTO radiator, with its straight lines, its low chassis, elegantly fitted, for low streamlined vehicles, has been a lesson to others.”

====1922-First Italian Grand prix at Monza”====
1922-First “Pole position” at the Inauguration of the Autodrome at Monza.
- 2002 – 80 years later, “Inauguration pole position” revisited.

- In Autumn 1922, in front of Mussolini, the First Gran Premio d’Italia was held, the “Inaugural Race” to celebrate the opening of the brand new Monza Autodrome, which had been built in record time: in pole position were a Diatto, a Bugatti and a Fiat.
- To celebrate the 80th anniversary of the Inaugural Race at Monza, in November 2002 the same line-up as the first Gran Premio d’Italia - Diatto, Bugatti and Fiat – raced against each other, an event which was enthusiastically reported by the sports press (Source: Corriere della sera, 12.11.2002).

====1923 model====
- 2.15.1923-Nationalist British magazine "The Auto Motor Journal - Road-Trials”, compares the performance of 2-liter Diatto those of 3-liter Bentley compressor: a success for Diatto.

- 5.31.1926-Source, L'auto Italiana: "DIATTO Type 30 is the fastest two-litre Italian cars on the market".

====1932 Production suspended====
- 1932-Production of cars is suspended
- In the early 1930s, after circa 8,500 automobiles produced, due to insuperable financial difficulties caused by the non-payment of the considerable military equipment supplied to the Italian kingdom for the first world war, DIATTO’s assembly lines are interrupted.
- Spare parts continue to be produced until 1955.

====1915–1925-DIATTO-BUGATTI.====
- Shortly before the first world war, Diatto begins working with Ettore Bugatti.
- The Diatto 8-cylinder engine for the wartime aircraft industry is built on licence from Bugatti.
- On September 23, 1916, Diatto sends an enthusiastic telegram to Bugatti: “Glad to tell you, excellent results from engine… tests concluded brilliantly at 210HP”.

- The magazines from the time reports the successful partnership widely:
- “Official tests for the Diatto-Bugatti engine: a true technical masterpiece, incomparable precision, strength and excellence of the materials, the compendium of all modern progress”.
- (source: 1916 - Motori, Aero, Cicli e Sports, Engine Diatto-Bugatti).

====Production of automobiles and racing cars Diatto-Bugatti====
- After the first world war, the collaboration between Diatto and Bugatti is extended to the design and production of road and race cars.

In 1919, at the International Motor Shows of Paris (Diatto has a branch in the Champs-Elysées) and London, Diatto presents five top of the range cars, including the “16 valve Diatto 30”, featuring chassis designed by Bugatti: “Luxury cars, Convertibles and Coupés with internal steering, refined bodywork and antique silk and velvet upholstery.
The Parisian upper classes, from Princess Murat to Madame Gould, bid against each other for the most luxurious Diatto-Bugatti cars at a price of 100,000 franks" (the price at the top, at the time). Also the Bugatti Type 23 is sold in Italy under Diatto brand (sources: 1988, Le Fanatique de l'automobile; 1999, The Automobile: the first 50 Diatto-Bugatti). Production of Diatto-Bugatti cars will continue for several years.

- (An excerpt from - Motori, Aero, Cicli e Sports,1919) “the names Diatto and Bugatti, with their long, sound tradition of mechanical engineering and daring innovation, brought together into a single enterprise, are extraordinarily eloquent and significant for any technician or automobile enthusiast”.

Thanks to this successful  collaboration, Diatto and Bugatti agree to construct a special series of race cars, initially with a 25 HP Sport Diatto chassis modified with a tubular axle and a supercharged 1500cc 4-cylinder Bugatti engine.

====1919 racing results - Diatto Bugatti====
- In 1919, the first post-war race, Diatto wins an outstanding first and second place, Diatto Type 30 (Bugatti) and Diatto 4DC, at the Parma-Poggio di Berceto (Italy). These special Diatto-Bugatti racing cars, lightweight and powerful, enjoy considerable success in rallies and uphill competitions: The Brescia Gentleman’s Grand Prix, (1° GP of Italy), the Susa–Moncenisio and the Aosta-San Bernardo – top right -, etc..

- Furthermore, some Bugatti “Brescia da corsa” models are also equipped with the powerful 2 litre DIATTO engine with 4 valves per cylinder (source, the book: Bugatti Magnum) to witness the technological versatility of the partnership in racing: Diatto chassis with Bugatti engines and vice versa. DIATTO-BUGATTI racing cars: a winning binomial (source: Incontri 2000).

====Diatto Maserati====
- 1922-1926-DIATTO-MASERATI.
- In 1922, DIATTO engages the driver and designer Alfieri Maserati, with his brother Ernesto, entrusting him the position of Racing Team Manager.

Alfieri Maserati, at the head of the DIATTO Racing Team until 1926, wins numerous victories; 1922 Monza – 1st Grand Prix: Maserati wins class in a 3 litre Diatto, second Sivocci in an Alfa Romeo, than in Sicily, from the Targa to the Florio Cup, from the Cremona circuit to the Coppa della Consuma, from the Colline Pistoiesi to the Monza Gran Prix, from the Aosta-Gran San Bernardo to the Parma-Poggio di Berceto, from the Limonest to the Schabenberg in France, from the Gothenburg to the Bollans in Swiss, from the Rebassada to the Valencia in Spain, etc.

- From 1924 to 1925, Maserati, under the lead of the director of Diatto, eng. Coda, that Maserati called "my professor", realizes the first 8C, 2,000cc Diatto engine with compressor.
The legendary supercharged, 160-HP, 8C, Diatto-Grand-Prix car with Schieppati bodywork is born. The car is unveiled by Maserati on 14 June 1925 at the inauguration of the famous “100 kph club”, an association founded by Diatto supporters at the Monza racetrack. Maserati drives a number of demonstration laps and to the enthusiasm of the crowd reached 180&amp;nbsp;km/h. Now, Maserati is mature to start the experience like constructor.

- The year after, in 1926, Maserati receives on payment some DIATTO Type 30 sport chassis, equipped with 8C engines, gears, suspensions and many mechanical parts. With these DIATTO rolling chassis and the vast technical and sporting know-how inherited from the DIATTO Racing Team, Maserati builds the first sports cars with the ‘Maserati’ brand (sources: 1985 - French magazine “Le Fanauto”, Automobile, Jenuary 1998, etc.)

'''DigitalGlobe''' is an American commercial vendor of space imagery and geospatial content, and operator of civilian [[remote sensing]] spacecraft. The company [[Initial Public Offering|went public]] on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] on 14 May 2009, selling 14.7 million shares at $19.00 each to raise $279 million in capital. On 5 October 2017, [[Maxar Technologies]] has completed its acquisition of DigitalGlobe.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geospatialworld.net/news/mda-dg-combined-entity-to-be-rebranded-as-maxar-technologies/|title=MDA-DG combined entity to be rebranded as Maxar Technologies|work=Geospatial World|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WorldView satellites should not be confused with WorldView company, a division of [[Paragon Space Development Corporation]] offering flights to near-space.

==Origins==
WorldView Imaging Corporation was founded in January 1992 in [[Oakland, California]] in anticipation of the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act (enacted in October 1992) which permitted private companies to enter the satellite imaging business.&lt;ref name="eomonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Duman |first=Angie |url=http://www.eomonline.com/Common/Archives/1995oct/95oct_tripp.html |title=xyHt &amp;#124; Positioning and Measurement, Elevated |website=Eomonline.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013192646/http://www.eomonline.com/Common/Archives/1995oct/95oct_tripp.html |archivedate=2008-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its founder was Dr Walter Scott, who was joined by co-founder and CEO Doug Gerull in late 1992. In 1993, the company received the first high [[Optical resolution|resolution]] commercial remote sensing satellite license issued under the 1992 Act.&lt;ref name="digitalglobehistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalglobe.com/about-us/company#history |title=Our Company |publisher=DigitalGlobe |date=2014-08-21 |accessdate=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was initially funded with private financing from [[Silicon Valley]] sources and interested corporations in N. America, Europe, and Japan.  Dr. Scott was head of the [[Lawrence Livermore Laboratories]] "Brilliant Pebbles" and "Brilliant Eyes" projects which were part of the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]].  Doug Gerull was the executive in charge of the Mapping Sciences division at the [[Intergraph Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Markoff |first=John |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE4D71638F931A25751C0A965958260 |title=COMPANY NEWS - A Plan for Close-Up Images of Earth From Space - NYTimes.com |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1993-02-12 |accessdate=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company's first remote sensing license from the [[United States Department of Commerce]] allowed it to build a commercial remote sensing [[Earth observation satellite|satellite]] capable of collecting images with {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} resolution.&lt;ref name="eomonline.com"/&gt;

In 1995, the company became EarthWatch Incorporated, merging WorldView with [[Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp.]]'s commercial remote sensing operations.&lt;ref name="companyhistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalglobe.com/about/history.shtml |title=Digital Globe - History |accessdate=2006-04-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060413043028/http://digitalglobe.com/about/history.shtml |archivedate=2006-04-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2001, EarthWatch became DigitalGlobe.&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asd.ssc.nasa.gov/datapurchase/default.aspx?s=6&amp;ss=2 |publisher=NASA |title=Scientific Data Purchase |accessdate=2006-04-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929025643/http://www.asd.ssc.nasa.gov/datapurchase/default.aspx?s=6&amp;ss=2 |archivedate=2006-09-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, DigitalGlobe acquired online imagery provider [[GlobeXplorer]] to extend its imagery distribution capabilities via online APIs and web services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SpaceNews » |url=http://spacenews.com/digitalglobe-buys-web-based-imagery-firm/ |title=Media |publisher=SpaceNews |date= |accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, DigitalGlobe was inducted into the [[Space Foundation]]'s [[Space Technology Hall of Fame]] for its role in advancing commercial Earth-imaging satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Space Foundation RSS Feed » |url=http://www.spacefoundation.org/news/story.php?id=1086 |title=Media |publisher=Space Foundation |date= |accessdate=2016-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004121908/http://www.spacefoundation.org/news/story.php?id=1086 |archivedate=2011-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, DigitalGlobe purchased GeoEye.

In February 2017, [[MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates|MDA]] and DigitalGlobe reached an agreement for MDA to acquire DigitalGlobe for US $2.4B.&lt;ref&gt;http://spacenews.com/mda-to-acquire-digitalglobe/&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2017, DigitalGlobe's image catalog contains 100 [[petabytes]] worth of data, and grows by 100 [[terabytes]] each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/05/best-way-transmit-satellite-data-trucks-really/|title=THE BEST WAY TO TRANSMIT SATELLITE DATA?

'''Employers of Poland''' (known as "'''The Confederation of Polish Employers'''" from 1989 to 2010)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/2010/07/articles/pl1007019i.htm The Confederation of Polish Employers]&lt;/ref&gt; is the oldest and the largest organisation of [[employer]]s in [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pracodawcyrp.pl/en/about-us/who-we-are/ Employers of Poland]&lt;/ref&gt;

Employers of Poland represents both individual [[Business|companies]] and regional or sectoral organisations. In 2008 and 2009, the Confederation began the execution of two large projects: the Legislation Monitoring Center and the Observatory of Regional Labour Markets.

In the years 2005.2009, the Employers of Poland strengthened its position as the largest and most representative organization of employers in Poland. Employers united in the organization employ over 2.5 million people. Over seven thousand [[Business|enterprises]] from all [[Business sector|sectors]] and industries belong to the organization either directly or indirectly.

A '''Fagan inspection''' is a process of trying to find [[wikt:defect|defects]] in documents (such as [[source code]] or formal specifications) during various phases of the [[software development process]]. It is named after Michael Fagan, who is credited{{by whom|date=November 2018}} with being the inventor of formal [[software inspection]]s.

Fagan inspection defines{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} a process as a certain activity with pre-specified entry and [[exit criteria]]. In every process for which entry and exit criteria are specified, Fagan inspections can be used to validate if the output of the process complies with the exit criteria specified for the process. Fagan inspection uses a group review method to evaluate the output of a given process.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

{{portal|Software Testing}}

== Examples ==
Examples of activities for which Fagan inspection can be used are:
* Requirement specification
* Software/Information System architecture (for example DYA{{huh|date=November 2018}}){{citation needed|date=November 2018}}
* Programming (for example for iterations in [[Extreme Programming|XP]] or [[Dynamic Systems Development Method|DSDM]])
* Software testing (for example when creating test scripts)

== Usage ==
The [[software development process]] is a typical application of Fagan inspection. As the costs to remedy a defect are up to 10 to 100 times less in the early operations compared to fixing a defect in the maintenance phase&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fagan|first=M. E.|date=1976|title=Design and code inspections to reduce errors in program development|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1147/sj.153.0182|journal=IBM Systems Journal|volume=15|issue=3|pages=182–211|doi=10.1147/sj.153.0182|issn=0018-8670}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it is essential to find defects as close to the point of insertion as possible. This is done by inspecting the output of each operation and comparing that to the output requirements, or [[exit criteria]], of that operation.

=== Criteria ===
Entry criteria are the criteria or requirements which must be met to enter a specific process.&lt;ref name="fagan86"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.mfagan.com/pdfs/aisi1986.pdf|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-48354-7_14|chapter=Advances in Software Inspections|title=Pioneers and Their Contributions to Software Engineering|pages=335|year=2001|last1=Fagan|first1=Michael E|isbn=978-3-540-42290-7|orig-year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for Fagan inspections the high- and low-level documents must comply with specific entry criteria before they can be used for a formal inspection process.

Exit criteria are the criteria or requirements which must be met to complete a specific process. For example, for Fagan inspections the low-level document must comply with specific exit criteria (as specified in the high-level document) before the development process can be taken to the next phase.

The exit criteria are specified in a high-level document, which is then used as the standard to which the operation result (low-level document) is compared during the inspection. Any failure of the low-level document to satisfy the high-level requirements specified in the high-level document are called ''defects''&lt;ref name="fagan86"/&gt; (and can be further categorized as ''major'' or ''minor'' defects). Minor defects do not threaten the correct functioning of the software, but may be small errors such as spelling mistakes or unaesthetic positioning of controls in a [[graphical user interface]].

=== Typical operations ===
A typical Fagan inspection consists of the following operations:&lt;ref name="fagan86"/&gt;
* Planning
** Preparation of materials
** Arranging of participants
** Arranging of meeting place
* Overview
** Group education of participants on the materials under review
** Assignment of roles
* Preparation
** The participants review the item to be inspected and supporting material to prepare for the meeting noting any questions or possible defects
** The participants prepare their roles
* Inspection meeting
** Actual finding of defect
* Rework {{Anchor|Rework}}
** Rework is the step in software inspection in which the defects found during the inspection meeting are resolved by the author, designer or programmer. On the basis of the list of defects the low-level document is corrected until the requirements in the high-level document are met.
* Follow-up {{Anchor|Follow-up}}
** In the follow-up phase of software inspections all defects found in the inspection meeting should be corrected (as they have been fixed in the rework phase). The moderator is responsible for verifying that this is indeed the case. He should verify that all defects are fixed and no new defects are inserted while trying to fix the initial defects. It is crucial that all defects be corrected, as the costs of fixing them in a later phase of the project can be 10 to 100 times higher compared to the current costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fagan|first=M. E.|date=1976|title=Design and code inspections to reduce errors in program development|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1147/sj.153.0182|journal=IBM Systems Journal|volume=15|issue=3|pages=182–211|doi=10.1147/sj.153.0182|issn=0018-8670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fagan Inspection Simple flow.svg|center|frame|Fagan inspection basic model]]

=== Follow-up ===
In the follow-up phase of a Fagan inspection, defects fixed in the rework phase should be verified. The moderator is usually responsible for verifying rework. Sometimes fixed work can be accepted without being verified, such as when the defect was trivial. In non-trivial cases, a full re-inspection is performed by the inspection team (not only the moderator).

If verification fails, go back to the rework process.

== Roles ==
The inspection process is normally performed by members of the same team that is implementing the project. The participants fulfill different roles within the inspection process:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Fagan|last=M.E.|title=Design and Code inspections to reduce errors in program development|year=1976|journal=IBM Systems Journal|volume=15|issue=3|pages=182–211|doi=10.1147/sj.153.0182|url=http://www.mfagan.com/pdfs/ibmfagan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1109/SEW.2002.1199450|chapter=An empirical study of modifying the Fagan inspection process and the resulting main effects and interaction effects among defects found, effort required, rate of preparation and inspection, number of team members and product 1st pass quality|title=27th Annual NASA Goddard/IEEE Software Engineering Workshop, 2002. Proceedings|pages=58|year=2003|last1=Eickelmann|first1=N.S|last2=Ruffolo|first2=F|last3=Baik|first3=J|last4=Anant|first4=A|isbn=0-7695-1855-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Author/Designer/Coder: the person who wrote the low-level document
* Reader: paraphrases the low-level document
* Reviewers: reviews the low-level document from a testing standpoint
* Moderator: responsible for the inspection session, functions as a coach

== Benefits and results ==
By using inspections the number of errors in the final product can significantly decrease, creating a higher quality product. In the future the team will even be able to avoid errors as the inspection sessions give them insight into the most frequently made errors in both design and coding providing avoidance of error at the root of their occurrence. By continuously improving the inspection process these insights can even further be used &lt;ref name=fagan86 /&gt;.

Together with the qualitative benefits mentioned above major "cost improvements" can be reached as the avoidance and earlier detection of errors will reduce the amount of resources needed for debugging in later phases of the project.

In practice very positive results have been reported by large corporations such as IBM,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} indicating that 80% to 90% of defects can be found and savings in resources up to 25% can be reached.&lt;ref name="fagan86"/&gt;

== Improvements ==
Although the Fagan inspection method has been proved to be very effective,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} improvements have been suggested by multiple researchers. Genuchten{{who|date=November 2018}} for example has been researching the usage of an [[Electronic meeting system|Electronic Meeting System]] (EMS) to improve the productivity of the meetings with positive results &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Genuchten|first=M |author2=Cornelissen, W |author3=Van Dijk, C|title=Supporting Inspections with an Electronic Meeting System|journal=Journal of Management Information Systems|date=Winter 1997–1998|volume=14|issue=3|pages=165–179|doi=10.1080/07421222.1997.11518179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers propose the usage of software that keeps a database of detected errors and automatically scans program code for these common errors &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doolan|first=E.P.|title=Experience with Fagan's Inspection Method|journal=Software—Practice and Experience|date=February 1992|volume=22|issue=2|pages=173–182|doi=10.1002/spe.4380220205}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This again should result in improved productivity.

The {{nihongo|'''Family Computer Network System'''|ファミリーコンピュータ ネットワークシステム|Famirī Konpyūta Nettowāku Shisutemu|lead=yes}}, also known as the '''Famicom Net System''' or '''Famicom Modem''', is a video game peripheral for Nintendo's [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]], released in September 1988 only in Japan. It uses a card based format, reminiscent to the [[HuCard]] for [[Hudson Soft]]'s and [[NEC]]'s [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] or the [[Sega Card]] for the [[Master System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/oroti/famicom/ish11.html |title=ファミコンの周辺機器が大集合! ザ☆周辺機器ズ 11 |publisher=Ne.jp |date= |accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/2006/03/25/103,1143298259,50588,0,0.html Wi-Fiコネクションについて講演　『ウイイレ』など40タイトルが開発中]''. [[Famitsu]]. 25 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It allowed the user access to a server that provided live stock trades, [[cheating in video games|game cheats]], jokes, weather forecasts, horse betting, and a small amount of downloadable content.&lt;ref name="How the Famicom Modem was Born"&gt;{{ cite magazine | first=Masaharu | last=Takano | title=How the Famicom Modem was Born | others=[http://www.glitterberri.com/developer-interviews/how-the-famicom-was-born/developing-the-famicom-modem/ English translation by GlitterBerri] | date=September 11, 1995 | magazine=Nikkei Electronics | language=Japanese }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience Nintendo gained with this endeavor led directly to the deployment of the satellite based [[Satellaview]] network for the [[Super Famicom]] in the early 1990s.  Nintendo would eventually engage in Internet based networking, via the [[64DD]] and its accompanying Randnet service, the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]], the [[Nintendo GameCube–Game Boy Advance cable|Game Boy Advance Cable]], the Nintendo DS's DS Download Play, the Wii's [[WiiConnect24]] and its shop, the [[Nintendo DSi]]'s DSi Shop, and the [[Nintendo Network]] for the [[Nintendo 3DS]], [[Wii U]], and [[Nintendo Switch | Switch]].

==History==
===Development===
Beginning in mid-1987, Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi requested the exploration of a partnership with the [[Nomura Securities]] financial company, to create an information network service in Japan based on the Famicom.  Led by Masayuki Uemura, [[Nintendo Research &amp; Development 2]] developed the modem hardware; and Nomura Securities developed the client and server software and the information database. Uemura cautioned that they "weren't confident that they would be able to make network games entertaining".  Five unreleased prototypes of network-enabled games were developed for the system, including Yamauchi's favorite classic, [[Go (game)|Go]].&lt;ref name="How the Famicom Modem was Born"/&gt;

===Production===
[[File:Nintendo-Famicom-Modem-Network-System-04.jpg|thumb|right|The telephone line connectors on the bottom of the modem.]]
[[File:Nintendo-Famicom-Modem-Controller.jpg|thumb|right|The controller included with the modem.]]
The Famicom Modem began mass production in September 1988. The accompanying proprietary online service was soon launched the same year alongside [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone]]'s new DDX-TP telephone gateway for its existing packet switched network.  NTT's launch initially suffered reliability problems that were painstakingly assessed by Nintendo at individual users' homes and traced back to the network.&lt;ref name="How the Famicom Modem was Born"/&gt;

Nintendo's sole final application of the Famicom Modem was the 1991 system called Super Mario Club.  It was formed for toy shops, where the Famicom was deployed as a networked arcade kiosk, serving consumers with a member-store-created searchable online database of Famicom game reviews. Nintendo performed market research by analyzing users' search behaviors, and directly received user feedback messages.&lt;ref name="How the Famicom Modem was Born"/&gt;

In June 1989, Nintendo of America's vice president of marketing Peter Main, said that the Famicom was present in 37% of Japan's households and that its interactive game and stock network based upon the Famicom Modem had been running for some time.&lt;ref name="How Nintendo Can Help A.T.&amp;T"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=International New York Times | issn=0362-4331 | title=Talking Deals; How Nintendo Can Help A.T.&amp;T. | first=Michael | last=Freitag | date=June 8, 1989 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/08/business/talking-deals-how-nintendo-can-help-at-t.html | accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Nintendo-Famicom-Modem-Network-System-Horse-Betting.jpg|thumb|right|The software card for the horse betting program.]]
Nintendo shipped a lifetime total of 130,000 Famicom Modems. Even after the resolution of stability problems with the NTT's network launch, the Famicom Modem market presence was considered "weak" for its whole lifetime for various reasons: product usability; competition from personal computers and other appliances; and the difficult nature of early adoption by the technologically unsavvy financial customer. Uemura stated that the system's most popular application was ultimately home-based horse race betting, with a peak of 100,000 units used and capturing 35% of the online horse betting market even amongst diverse competition from PCs and from dedicated horse betting network terminal appliances.&lt;ref name="How the Famicom Modem was Born"/&gt;

===Legacy===
Wanting to replicate and expand upon the progress seen with the Famicom Modem in Japan, Nintendo of America began a series of open announcements in mid-1989 to describe its private talks with AT&amp;T over the prospect of launching an information network service in America in 1990.&lt;ref name="How Nintendo Can Help A.T.&amp;T"/&gt;  The plans never materialized.

A modem for NES was tested in the United States by the [[Minnesota State Lottery]]. It would have allowed players to buy [[scratchcard]]s and play the lottery with their NES at home. It was not released in the United States because some parents and legislators voiced concern that minors might learn to play the lottery illegally and anonymously, regardless of assurances from Nintendo to the contrary.&lt;ref name="lottery"&gt;{{cite news |title= Nintendo and Minnesota Set A Living-Room Lottery Test|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/27/business/nintendo-and-minnesota-set-a-living-room-lottery-test.html|accessdate=2008-02-16|date =1991-09-27|work=New York Times | first=Eben | last=Shapiro}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet-based gambling was banned in Minnesota.&lt;ref name="Minnesota Gambling and Criminal Defense"&gt;{{cite web | title=Minnesota Gambling and Criminal Defense | url=http://www.nvo.com/beaulier/minnesotagamblingcrimes/ | accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online content would later be delivered to Nintendo's customers via the [[Super Famicom]]'s [[Satellaview]] peripheral. Masayuki Uemura, lead designer of the Famicom Modem at [[Nintendo Research &amp; Development 2]], said: "Our experiences with the Famicom Modem triggered Nintendo’s entrance into the satellite data broadcasting market in April, 1995".&lt;ref name="How the Famicom Modem was Born"/&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9151">A '''fare basis code''' (often just referred to as a '''fare basis''') is an alphabetic or alpha-numeric code used by airlines to identify a fare type and allow airline staff and travel agents to find the rules applicable to that fare.  Although airlines now set their own fare basis codes, there are some patterns that have evolved over the years and may still be in use.

Fare codes start with a letter called a '''booking class''' (indicating [[travel class]] among other things) which almost always matches the letter code that the reservation is booked in.&lt;ref name="cranky"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://crankyflier.com/2007/07/25/fun-with-fare-basis-codes/ | title=The Cranky Flier, Fun with Fare Basis Codes | year=2007 | accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other letters or numbers may follow.  Typically a fare basis will be 3 to 7 characters long,&lt;ref name="gbtp"&gt;{{cite book | title=A Guide to Becoming a Travel Professional | author=Todd/Ginger, Rice, Susan | year=2005 | page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; but can be up to 8.&lt;ref name="cranky"/&gt;

== Booking class ==

The first character of the fare basis code is always a letter, and will almost always match the booking class.&lt;ref name="gal"&gt;{{cite book | title=Galileo 360(degrees). V1 Course book. | publisher=Galileo Travelport | year=2009 | page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Booking codes are the identifiers used by the airline's [[revenue management]] department to control how many seats can be sold at a particular fare level.  For example, a plane may have 25 economy seats still available and the airline may show it in a reservation system as &lt;code&gt;Y7 K5 M4 T6 E3&lt;/code&gt; which indicates how many of each booking class can be reserved. Some codes cannot be sold by agents, and those seats may be reserved for international connections, loyalty programs, or airline staff relocation.

Booking codes were defined by [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]],{{cn|date=February 2018}} but airlines have deviated from the IATA standard and current booking codes are airline-specific.&lt;ref name="gal12"&gt;{{cite book | title=Galileo 360(degrees). V1 Course book. Galileo Travelport. 2009. | page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same code may have different meanings for tickets issued by different airlines. Many airlines use nearly all letters of the alphabet to allow finer yield management. Nevertheless, certain booking codes have retained the same meaning across most airlines:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Booking code
! Meaning
|-
| F
| full-fare [[First class (aviation)|First class]]&lt;ref name="gal1316"&gt;{{cite book | title=Galileo 360(degrees). V1 Course book. Galileo Travelport. 2009. | year=2009 | pages=13–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;, on airlines which have first class distinct from business class. 
|-
| J
| full-fare [[Business class]]
|-
| W
| full-fare [[Premium economy]]&lt;ref&gt;on airlines that offer it, may be some discount economy on airlines without it such as [[Turkish Airlines]]&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Y
| full-fare [[Economy class]]
|}

== Other common patterns ==
Letters and numbers in other sections of the fare basis code may provide the following information:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Code
! Standard position in fare basis code
! style="width: 70%;" |Meaning
|-
| E 
| Second letter
| This often indicated that the fare was an "Excursion Fare".  These fares typically had a minimum and maximum stay requirement to encourage use by the holiday market and not business travellers.
|-
| Numerals
| Latter parts of the fare basis
| Numerals often indicate the maximum stay the fare rules will allow at a destination. Thus a YE45 is an economy excursion fare with a maximum stay of 45 days.  Similar patterns could be YE3M indicating a 3-month maximum.&lt;ref name="cranky" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gal1316" /&gt;
|-
| H or L
| Other than first letter
| High or low season&lt;ref name="gal1316" /&gt;
|-
| W or X 
| Other than as the first letter
| These two letters are commonly used in airfares to state if a fare is valid on a weekday (X) or restricted to weekends (W).&lt;ref name="gal1316" /&gt; The specific days of a weekend may vary, and can include Friday travel.
|-
| OW
|On higher level fares, normally follows the initial booking code.
| One-way fare only&lt;ref name="gal1316" /&gt;
|-
| RT
|On higher level fares, normally follows the initial booking code.
| Return fare
|-
| Two-letter country codes
|Usually at the end of the code, except if followed by "CH" or "IN"
| Fare bases often end with two-letter country codes. This will be the case when an airline has an international fare in both directions. For example, a fare from Great Britain to Australia may be YE3MGB, and YE3MAU from Australia to Great Britain.&lt;ref name="gal1316" /&gt; This allows the fare to have similar rules, but may have some variations in change fees or to comply with local trade restrictions.
|-
| CH 
| Last two characters
|Child fare (typically up to 11 years old, but 15 in some cases)
|-
| IN
| Last two characters
|Infant fare (typically up to 2 years old, but 3 years in some cases)
|}

== Airline-specific codes ==
There is an endless list of other codes on modern fares. These are not standardized in any way, and may often be for short-term use. The following are some examples:
* '''Codes that indicate an airline's common name for a fare'''.  As a hypothetical example, an airline selling what they refer to as their "Super-Saver" fare may use SPRSVR in the fare basis, or may use it as the entire code.
* '''Codes that limit a fare to a particular company or organisation'''.  An airline may negotiate a fare with the XYZ company and include these letters in their fare basis.  Negotiated fares are normally only visible to agents that have a contract to sell them, and are not publicly listed.
* '''Codes for use with military personnel, or federal government employees'''. These are commonly used in the United States, and often indicate fares with minimal or no restrictions on changes and refunds.
* '''ID''' and '''AD''' used for airline staff (Industry Discount) and travel agency staff (Agent Discount). It may include a number indicating the percentage of discount from the full fare, e.g., AD75.

== Fare construction ==
Fare construction refers to the application of fares which can cover the flights in the reservation, necessary to price the air ticket for issuance.

It is commonly presented as a single line with standardized codes&lt;ref&gt;[https://servicehub.amadeus.com/c/portal/view-solution/774026/en_US/fare-calculation-symbols-and-explanations Fare Calculation Symbols and Explanations, Amadeus]&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used for travel agents to price the ticket in [[global distribution system]]s. For example, a fare construction may say:

{|class=wikitable
 |-
 |HKG||SU||X/MOW||SU||KGD||598.78SCLA||/-RIX||SU||X/MOW||SU||HKG||371.37ACLA||NUC 970.15||END||ROE 7.849222||XT 160G3 120HK 45I5 105RI 33LV 61XM 713YQ
 |-
 |from [[Hong Kong]]||by [[Aeroflot]]||transfer in [[Moscow]]||by [[Aeroflot]]||to [[Kaliningrad]]||598.78 on fare SCLA||[[arrival unknown]] to [[Riga]]||by [[Aeroflot]]||transfer at [[Moscow]]||by [[Aeroflot]]||to [[Hong Kong]]||371.37 on fare ACLA||total fare in [[Neutral unit of construction|NUC]]|| end of fare ||rate of exchange|| the various taxes, fees and charges added in ticketing currency
 |}

Fare construction is a complicated task because each fare comes with a lot of rules regarding the usage, however the rules are designed to be validatable by computers so the system can decide to accept or reject easily. Most commonly fare construction is done by a computer automatically, but it is not guaranteed that the lowest fares can be found, therefore manual fare construction can also be done, which means finding the suitable fares manually and applying the fares to an itinerary in order to buy a ticket.

== Multiple fare basis ==
It is common for a multi-sector air ticket to have more than one fare basis, particularly if it is for carriage on more than one airline, or different classes of travel are involved. The issuing airline may often have an interline agreement to allow other airlines on the ticket. One disadvantage of this system is that if any change is made, the most restrictive fare rule, and/or the highest change fee, may apply to the entire ticket, not just the portion being changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businesstravel.about.com/od/faqs/g/Glossary-Fare-Basis.htm |title=What is a Fare Basis (or fare code)? |publisher=Businesstravel.about.com |date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global Distribution Systems ==
In a [[Global Distribution System]], the fare basis will typically display as part of a fare display, and will not normally be shown in an availability display.
Some modern booking systems allow availability searches using parameters such as time of day and lowest fare, and may negate the need for an agent to firstly study the fare basis rules.

== Tickets ==
The fare basis is normally shown on the air ticket.  On older paper tickets, it was highlighted on the relevant coupon for that flight. On modern e-tickets, it is often printed under the flight details.

==By food type==

===Beef===
[[File:Beef inspection USDA.jpg|thumb|Inspected beef carcasses tagged by the USDA]]
[[Beef carcass classification | Beef grading]] in the United States is performed by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s (USDA) Agricultural and Marketing Service.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, R.O. (2001).[https://books.google.com/books?id=kouqQnLl7V4C&amp;pg=PA272 ''Introduction to Food Science''].Cengage Learning. pp. 272-277. {{ISBN|0766813142}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are eight beef quality grades, with U.S. Prime being the highest grade and U.S. Canner being the lowest grade. Beef grading is a complex process.

===Beer===
{{Main|Beer measurement}}
In [[Beer measurement#XXX marks|beer grading]], the letter "X" is used on some beers, and was traditionally a mark of beer strength, with the more Xs the greater the strength. Some sources suggest that the origin of the mark was in the [[Brewery|breweries]] of [[medieval]] [[Monastery|monasteries]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eHArQOTf_WQC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=xxx+beer+strength&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GhD5TfaXNsSq-gbquNTeDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=xxx%20beer%20strength&amp;f=false Beer: Health and Nutrition], Charles W. Bamforth, Blackwell Science Ltd 2004 {{ISBN|0-632-06446-3}} p.34&lt;/ref&gt; Another plausible explanation is contained in a treatise entitled "The Art of Brewing" published in [[London]] in 1829. It says; ''"The [[Excise|duties]] on ale and beer, which were first imposed in 1643... at a certain period, in distinguishing between [[small beer]] and strong, all ale or beer, sold at or above ten [[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]]s per barrel, was reckoned to be'' strong ''and was, therefore, subjected to a higher duty. The cask which contained this strong beer was then first marked with an X signifying ten; and hence the present quack-like denominations of XX (double X) and XXX (treble X) on the casks and accounts of the strong-ale brewers".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wF89AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=XXX+beer+strength&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fvH4Tbi8AoqwhQe9pYjyCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=XXX%20beer%20strength&amp;f=false The Art of Brewing (Published under the superintendance of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge)], Baldwin &amp; Craddock, London 1829 p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-19th century England, the use of "X" and other letters had evolved into a standardised grading system for the strength of beer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europeanbeerguide.net/beer_strengths_1860_1900.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is used as a [[trade mark]] by a number of brewers in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and the [[United States]].

[[Beer measurement#Bitterness|European Bitterness Units scale]], often abbreviated as EBU, is a scale for measuring the perceived [[bitter (taste)|bitter]]ness of [[beer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; with lower values being generally "less bitter" and higher values "more bitter". The scale and method are defined by the [[European Brewery Convention]], and the numerical value should be the same as of the International Bitterness Units scale (IBU), defined in co-operation with the [[American Society of Brewing Chemists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the exact process of determining EBU and IBU values differs slightly, which may in theory result with slightly smaller values for EBU than IBU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The International Bittering Units scale, or simply IBU scale, provides a measure of the [[bitter (taste)|bitterness]] of [[beer]], which is provided by the [[hops]] used during brewing.  Bittering units are measured through the use of a [[spectrophotometer]] and solvent extraction.&lt;ref name="ASBC_Beer23"&gt;{{Citation |mode=cs1 | contribution = Beer Bitterness (Beer-23) | title = Methods of Analysis | publisher = American Society of Brewing Chemists | year = 1996 | pages = Beer–23:1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Butter===
{{Main|Butter grading}}

===Coconut milk===
Several [[Coconut milk#Preparation|grades of coconut milk]] exist: from thick at 20-22% fat to thin at 5-7% fat level.

===Coffee===
[[File:Coffee Beans closeup.jpg|thumb|Dark-roasted coffee beans]]
Coffee growers, traders, and roasters grade beans based on size, color, and a variety of other characteristics. Coffees of exceptional quality are traded as "specialty coffees" and fetch a higher price in the international market.&lt;ref&gt;Specialty Coffee Association of America. [http://www.scaa.org/?page=resources&amp;d=green-coffee-protocols ''Green Coffee Protocols''] Accessed April 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the roast, [[Coffee#Grading the roasted seeds|Coffee grading]] involves assessment of [[Coffee roasting|roasted coffee]] seed colorization and then labeling as light, medium light, medium, medium dark, dark, or very dark. A more accurate method of discerning the degree of roast involves measuring the reflected light from roasted seeds illuminated with a light source in the near [[infrared]] spectrum. This elaborate light meter uses a process known as [[spectroscopy]] to return a number that consistently indicates the roasted coffee's relative degree of roast or flavor development.

===Eggs===
In the United States, [[Egg (food)#Grading by quality and size|egg grading]] is performed by the USDA, and is based upon the interior quality of the egg (see [[Haugh unit]]) and the appearance and condition of the egg shell. Eggs of any quality grade may differ in weight (size). Egg grading is performed by candling, which involves observing the interior of eggs by placing them in front of a bright light.&lt;ref name=Sivasankar/&gt;

===Guar gum===
[[Guar gum#Grading|Guar gum grading]] involves analysis for coloration, [[viscosity]], moisture, granulation, protein content and insolubles ash.

===Honey===
[[Honey#Grading|Honey grading]] in the United States is performed voluntarily based upon [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] standards (USDA does offer inspection and grading "as on-line (in-plant) or lot inspection...upon application, on a fee-for-service basis.") . Honey is graded based upon a number of factors, including water content, flavor and aroma, absence of defects and clarity. Honey is also classified by color though it is not a factor in the grading scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELDEV3011895|title=United States Standards for Grades of Extracted Honey|publisher=USDA|accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. honey grade scales are Grade A, Grade B, Grade C and Grade substandard.

===Lobster===
[[File:Homarus americanus.jpg|thumb|A [[lobster]]]]
In the U.S., [[Lobster#Grading|lobster grading]] involves denoting lobsters as new-shell, hard-shell or old-shell, and because lobsters which have recently shed their shells are the most delicate, there is an inverse relationship between the price of American lobster and its flavour. New-shell lobsters have paper-thin shells and a worse meat-to-shell ratio, but the meat is very sweet. However, the lobsters are so delicate that even transport to Boston almost kills them, making the market for new-shell lobsters strictly local to the fishing towns where they are offloaded. Hard-shell lobsters with firm shells, but with less sweet meat, can survive shipping to Boston, New York and even Los Angeles, so they command a higher price than new-shell lobsters. Meanwhile, old-shell lobsters, which have not shed since the previous season and have a coarser flavour, can be air-shipped anywhere in the world and arrive alive, making them the most expensive. One seafood guide notes that an eight-dollar lobster dinner at a restaurant overlooking fishing piers in Maine is consistently delicious, while "the eighty-dollar lobster in a three-star Paris restaurant is apt to be as much about presentation as flavor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul |last=Johnson |title=Fish Forever: The Definitive Guide to Understanding, Selecting, and Preparing Healthy, Delicious, and Environmentally Sustainable Seafood | chapter=Lobster | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7645-8779-5|pages=163–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maple syrup===

Following an effort from the International Maple Syrup Institute (IMSI) and many [[maple syrup]] producer associations, both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding the classification of maple syrup to be uniform. Whereas in the past each state or province had their own laws on the classification of maple syrup, now those laws define a unified grading system. This had been a work in progress for several years, and most of the finalization of the new grading system was made in 2014. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced in the [[Canada Gazette]] on 28 June 2014 that rules for the sale of maple syrup would be amended to include new descriptors, at the request of the IMSI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/maple-syrup-labelling-changes-on-tap-1.2690538|title=Maple syrup labelling changes on tap|publisher=CBC News|date=27 June 2014|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 31, 2014, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalmaplesyrupinstitute.com/uploads/7/0/9/2/7092109/nr_-_maple_regs_cgii_mino_approved_final_en_1_4.pdf|title=Harper Government Strengthens Competitiveness of Canada's Maple Syrup Industry|publisher=Canadian Food Inspection Agency|date=16 December 2014|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of March 2, 2015, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)&lt;ref name="usda.gov"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; issued revised standards on the classification of maple syrup as follows:

*Grade A
**Golden Color and Delicate Taste
**Amber Color and Rich Taste
**Dark Color and Robust Taste
**Very Dark Color and Strong Taste
*Processing Grade
*Substandard

As long as maple syrup does not have an off-flavor and is of a uniform color and clean and free from [[turbidity]] and sediment, it can be labelled as one of the A grades. If it exhibits any of these problems, it does not meet Grade A requirements and must be labelled as Processing Grade maple syrup and may not be sold in containers smaller than 5 gallons.&lt;ref name="usda.gov"/&gt; If maple syrup does not meet the requirements of Processing Grade maple syrup (including a fairly characteristic maple taste), it is classified as Substandard.&lt;ref name="usda.gov"/&gt;
As of February 2015, this grading system has been accepted and made law by most maple-producing states and provinces, other than Ontario, Quebec, and Ohio. Vermont, in an effort to "jump-start" the new grading regulations, adopted the new grading system as of January 1, 2014, after the grade changes passed the Senate and House in 2013. Maine passed a bill to take effect as soon as both Canada and the United States adopted the new grades. They are allowing a one-year grace period. In New York, the new grade changes became law on January 1, 2015, with a one-year grace period. New Hampshire did not require legislative approval and so the new grade laws became effective as of December 16, 2014, and producer compliance was required as of January 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalmaplesyrupinstitute.com/downloadable-resources.html|title=United States Standards for Grades of Maple Syrup|publisher=International Maple Syrup Institute|date=29 January 2015|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Golden and Amber grades typically have a milder flavor than Dark and Very dark, which are both dark and have an intense maple flavor.&lt;ref name="dnr"/&gt; The darker grades of syrup are used primarily for cooking and baking, although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use.&lt;ref name="mcgee"&gt;{{cite book |last=McGee |first=Harold |title=On food and cooking: the science and lore of the kitchen|edition=2nd |year=2004 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |pages=668–669|isbn=978-0-684-80001-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syrup harvested earlier in the season tends to yield a lighter color.&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson|first=Jennifer|title=Very Maple Syrup|year=2003 |publisher=Celestial Arts |page=2|isbn=978-1587611810}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the new grading system, the classification of maple syrup depends ultimately on its internal [[transmittance]] at 560 nm [[wavelength]] through a 10 mm sample. Golden has to have more than 75 percent transmittance, Amber has to have 50.0 to 74.9 percent transmittance, Dark has to have 25.0 to 49.9 percent transmittance, and Very Dark is any product less than 25.0 percent transmittance.&lt;ref name="usda.gov"/&gt;

==== Old grading system ====
[[File:Syrup grades large.JPG|thumb|Old US maple syrup grades, left to right: ''Grade A Light Amber ("Fancy")'', ''Grade A Medium Amber'', ''Grade A Dark Amber'', ''Grade B'']]
[[File:Can of Quebec Maple Syrup.JPG|thumb|[[Maple syrup]] from [[Quebec]], graded as No. 1, Light (enlarge image to read the label atop the can)]]

In Canada, maple syrup was classified prior to December 31, 2014, by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) as one of three grades, each with several color classes: Canada No. 1, including Extra Light, Light, and Medium; No. 2 Amber; and No. 3 Dark or any other ungraded category. Producers in Ontario or Québec may have followed either federal or provincial grading guidelines. Québec's and Ontario's guidelines differed slightly from the federal: there were two "number" categories in Québec (Number 1, with four color classes, and 2, with five color classes).&lt;ref name="msgqc1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Maple Syrup Grades |url=http://www.siropderable.ca/Afficher.aspx?page=74&amp;langue=en |publisher=Fédération des producteurs acéricoles du Québec |accessdate=27 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828080841/http://www.siropderable.ca/Afficher.aspx?page=74&amp;langue=en |archivedate=28 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As in Québec, Ontario's producers had two "number" grades: 1, with three color classes; and 2, with one color class, which was typically referred to as "Ontario Amber" when produced and sold in that province only.&lt;ref name="omspa1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maple Syrup Grades |url=http://www.ontariomaple.com/fact-finding/pure-maple-syrup.html |publisher=Ontario Maple Syrup Producers Association |accessdate=19 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906233915/http://www.ontariomaple.com/fact-finding/pure-maple-syrup.html |archivedate=6 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical year's yield for a maple syrup producer will be about 25 to 30 percent of each of the #1 colors, 10 percent #2 Amber, and 2 percent #3 Dark.{{sfn|Elliot|2006|p=12}} Producers in Quebec and Ontario may follow either federal or provincial grading guidelines, which differ slightly.

The United States used (some states still do, as they await state regulation) different grading standards. Maple syrup was divided into two major grades: Grade A and Grade B. Grade A was further divided into three subgrades: Light Amber (sometimes known as Fancy), Medium Amber, and Dark Amber. The [[Vermont Agency of Agriculture Food and Markets]] used a similar grading system of color, and is roughly equivalent, especially for lighter syrups, but using letters: "AA", "A", etc.&lt;ref name="msgvt1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Maple Syrup Grades Vermont |url=http://www.vermontmaple.org/grades.php |publisher=Vermont Maple Syrup |accessdate=27 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307134732/http://www.vermontmaple.org/grades.php |archivedate=7 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ciesla|2002|p=41}} The Vermont grading system differed from the US system in maintaining a slightly higher standard of product density (measured on the [[Baumé scale]]). New Hampshire maintained a similar standard, but not a separate state grading scale. The Vermont-graded product had 0.9 percent more sugar and less water in its composition than US-graded. One grade of syrup not for table use, called commercial or Grade C, was also produced under the Vermont system.&lt;ref name="dnr"&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://maple.dnr.cornell.edu/FAQ.htm |publisher=Cornell Sugar Maple Research &amp; Extension Program |accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vermont inspectors enforce strict syrup grading regulations, and can fine producers up to US$1000 for labelling syrup incorrectly.{{sfn|Eagleson|Hasner|2006|p=33}}

===Milk===
In the United States, there are two [[Milk#Grading|grades of milk]], with Grade A primarily used for direct sales and consumption in stores, and Grade B used for indirect consumption, such as in cheese making or other processing.

The differences between the two grades are defined in the Wisconsin administrative code for Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection, chapter 60.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.wi.us/rsb/code/atcp/atcp060.pdf Wisconsin administrative code for Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection, Chapter ATCP 60]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-11-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Grade B generally refers to milk that is cooled in milk cans, which are immersed in a bath of cold flowing water that typically is drawn up from an underground water well rather than using mechanical refrigeration.

===Oranges===
The USDA has established the following [[Orange (fruit)#Grading|grades for Florida oranges]], which primarily apply to oranges sold as fresh fruit: US Fancy, US No. 1 Bright, US No. 1, US No. 1 Golden, US No. 1 Bronze, US No. 1 Russet, US No. 2 Bright, US No. 2, US No. 2 Russet, and US No. 3.&lt;ref name=usda_fla&gt;[http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5050382 United States Standards for Grades of Florida Oranges and Tangelos] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726100358/http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5050382 |date=July 26, 2011 }} (USDA; February, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The general characteristics graded are color (both hue and uniformity), firmness, maturity, varietal characteristics, texture, and shape. Fancy, the highest grade, requires the highest grade of color and an absence of blemishes&lt;!--original read "the highest grade of both color and blemishes". Makes no sense to me, but I'll leave it here just in case (far from an expert on the subject)--&gt;, while the terms Bright, Golden, Bronze, and Russet concern solely discoloration.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Peas===
[[File:Peas in pods - Studio.jpg|thumb|[[Peas]]]]
[[Pea#Grading|Pea grading]] involves sorting peas by size, in which smallest peas are graded as the highest quality for their tenderness.&lt;ref name=Sivasankar/&gt; [[Brine]]s may be used, in which peas are floated in them, from which their density can be determined.&lt;ref name=Sivasankar/&gt;

===Potatoes===
In the U.S., [[Potato#Grading|potato grading]] for [[Idaho]] potatoes is performed in which No. 1 potatoes are the highest quality and No. 2 are rated as lower in quality due to their appearance (e.g. blemishes or bruises, pointy ends).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.idahopotato.com/faqs#63 | title=Frequently Asked Questions | publisher=[[Idaho Potato Commission]] | accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Density assessment can be performed by floating them in brines.&lt;ref name=Sivasankar/&gt; High density potatoes are desirable in the production of dehydrated mashed potatoes, potato crisps and french fries.&lt;ref name=Sivasankar/&gt;

===Rice===
The main criteria used by many countries and millers in [[Grain quality#Classification and grading of rice|rice grading]] are degree of milling, appearance (color), damaged (broken) and percentage of chalky kernels. In the United States rice is marketed according to three main properties size, color and condition (kernels damage), these properties are directly related to quality, milling percentage and other processing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Serna-Saldivar, S.O. 2012. Cereal grains Laboratory Reference and Procedures Manual. Food Preservation Technology Series. LLC NW. CRC Press. Taylor and Francis Group.&lt;/ref&gt; All properties are considered important in grading. For instance, chalky kernels are not desirable because they give lower milling yields after processing and easily break during handling.

===Spices===

====Cinnamon====
In [[Sri Lanka]], [[Cinnamon#Grading|cinnamon grading]] is performed by dividing cinnamon quills into four groups, which are then further divided into specific grades.

====Vanilla====
[[Image:Sambava - grading vanilla beans.jpg|thumb|People grading [[Vanilla|vanilla bean]]s in [[Sambava]], [[Madagascar]]]]
Several [[Vanilla#Grading|vanilla fruit grading systems]] are in use. Each country which produces vanilla has its own grading system,&lt;ref name="Havkin grading"&gt;{{cite book|last=Havkin-Frenkel|first=Daphna|title=Handbook of Vanilla Science and Technology|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Chichester, UK|isbn=978-1-4051-9325-2|author2=Belanger, Faith C.|pages=142–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; and individual vendors, in turn, sometimes use their own criteria for describing the quality of the fruits they offer for sale.&lt;ref name=VanillaReview&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vanillareview.com/vanilla-information/#grades | title = Vanilla | accessdate = 2012-01-15 | publisher = VanillaReview.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tea===
{{Main|Tea leaf grading}}
In the western black [[tea]] industry, [[tea leaf grading]] is the process of [[Evaluation|evaluating]] products based on the quality and condition of the tea leaves themselves. The highest grades are referred to as "orange pekoe", and the lowest as "fannings" or "dust". This grading system is based upon the size of processed and dried black tea leaves. Despite a purported Chinese origin, these grading terms are typically used for teas from Sri Lanka, India and countries other than China; they are not generally known within Chinese-speaking countries.

====Black tea====
[[Black tea#Tea grading|Black tea grading]] is usually based upon one of four scales of quality. Whole-leaf teas are the highest quality, followed by broken leaves, [[fannings]], and dusts. Whole-leaf teas are produced with little or no alteration to the tea leaf. This results in a finished product with a coarser texture than that of bagged teas. Whole-leaf teas are widely considered the most valuable, especially if they contain leaf tips. Broken leaves are commonly sold as medium-grade loose teas. Smaller broken varieties may be included in tea bags.

File:Black tea grading.jpg|A [[black tea]] leaf grading diagram
File:TeaLeaves.JPG|Fresh tea leaves of different sizes
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Rooibos====
[[Rooibos#Grading|Rooibos grades]] are largely related to the proportion of "needle" or leaf to stem content in the mix. A higher leaf content will result in a darker liquor, richer flavour and less "dusty" aftertaste. The high-grade rooibos is exported and does not reach local markets, with major consumers being in the EU, particularly Germany, where it is used in creating flavoured blends for loose-leaf tea markets. In development within South Africa are a small number of specialty tea companies producing similar blends.

==Food additives and preservatives==

===Carrageenan===
There are two basic [[Carrageenan#Grades|grades of carrageenan]], refined carrageenan (RC) and semi-refined carrageenan (SRC). In the United States, RC and SRC are both labeled as carrageenan. In the European Union, RC is designated by the [[E number]] E-407, and SRC is E-407a. RC has a 2% maximum for acid-insoluble material and is produced through an alcohol precipitation process or potassium chloride gel press process. SRC contains a much higher level of cellulosic content and is produced in a less complex process. Indonesia, the Philippines, and Chile are three main sources of raw material and extracted carrageenan.

===Lye===
[[Lye#Food uses|Lye]] is used to [[Curing (food preservation)|cure]] foods such as [[lutefisk]], [[olive]]s (making them less bitter), canned [[mandarin orange]]s, [[hominy]], [[lye roll]]s, [[century egg]]s, and [[pretzel]]s. It is also used as a tenderizer in the crust of baked Cantonese [[mooncake]]s, and in lye-water "[[zongzi]]" ([[glutinous rice]] dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves), chewy southern Chinese noodles popular in Hong Kong and southern China, and Japanese [[ramen noodles]]. In the [[United States]], food-grade lye must meet the requirements outlined in the [[Food Chemicals Codex|Food Chemicals Codex (FCC)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usp.org/fcc/|title=USP Food Ingredient Standards|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as prescribed by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).&lt;ref name=FDA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/fdcact/fdcact4.htm|title=Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act)|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower grades of lye are commonly used as [[drain cleaner|drain]] or oven cleaner. Such grades should not be used for food preparation, as they may contain impurities harmful to human health.&lt;ref name="FDA"/&gt;

===Sodium bisulphate===
[[Sodium bisulphate#In food|Sodium bisulphate]] is used as a [[food additive]] to leaven cake mixes (make them rise) as well as being used in meat and poultry processing and most recently in browning prevention of fresh-cut produce. The food-grade product meets the requirements set out in the Food Chemicals Codex.  It is denoted by [[E number]] E514ii in the EU and is approved for use in Australia and New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2012C00863|title=Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code - Standard 1.2.4 - Labelling of Ingredients|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is listed as additive 514.  Food-grade sodium bisulfate is used in a variety of food products, including beverages, dressings, sauces, and fillings.

{{Intellectual property}}
A '''geographical indication''' ('''GI''') is a name or sign used on products which corresponds to a specific geographical location or origin (e.g. a town, region, or country). The use of a geographical indication, as a type of indication of source, may act as a certification that the product possesses certain qualities, is made according to traditional methods, or enjoys a certain reputation, due to its geographical origin.

[[Appellation d'origine contrôlée|Appellation of origin]] is a subtype of geographical indication where quality, method and reputation of a product strictly originate from the delineated area defined under its intellectual property right registration.

[[Image:GI_Collective_Dimension.png|700px|center|GI Collective Dimension]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

==History==

Governments have been protecting [[trade name]]s and [[trademarks]] used in relation to food products identified with a particular region since at least the end of the nineteenth century, using [[law]]s against false trade descriptions or [[passing off]], which generally protect against suggestions that a product has a certain origin, quality or association when it does not. In such cases, the limitation on competitive freedoms which results from the grant of a monopoly of use over a geographical indication is justified by governments either by consumer protection benefits or by producer protection benefits.

One of the first GI systems is the one used in [[France]] from the early part of the twentieth century known as ''[[appellation d'origine contrôlée]]'' (AOC). Items that meet geographical origin and quality standards may be endorsed with a government-issued stamp which acts as official certification of the origins and standards of the product to the consumer. Examples of products that have such 'appellations of origin' include [[Gruyère (cheese)|Gruyère cheese]] (from Switzerland) and many [[List of Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée wines|French wines]].

Geographical indications have long been associated with the concept of [[terroir]] and with [[Europe]] as an entity, where there is a tradition of associating certain food products with particular regions. Under [[European Union Law]], the [[protected designation of origin]] framework which came into effect in 1992 regulates the following systems of geographical indications: ''Protected designation of origin'' (PDO), ''protected geographical indication'' (PGI) and ''Traditional Specialities Guaranteed'' (TSG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tosato|first=Andrea|title=The Protection of Traditional Foods in the EU: Traditional Specialities Guaranteed|journal=European Law Journal|volume=19|issue=4|pages=545–576|doi=10.1111/eulj.12040|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eulj.12040/abstract|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal effect==
Geographical Indications protection is granted through the [[TRIPS Agreement]]. See also the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention]], the [[Madrid system|Madrid Agreement]], the [[Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration|Lisbon Agreement]], the [[Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration#2015 Act|Geneva Act]]. Protection afforded to geographical indications by law is arguably two folded. On the one hand it is granted through sui generis law (public law), e.g., in the European Union. In other words, GI protection should apply through ex-officio protection, where authorities may support and get involved in the making of GI collective dimensions together with their corresponding GI regulatory council, where ongoing discourse with the government is implied for effective inspection and quality control. On the other hand, it is granted through common law (private law). In other words, it is similar to the protection afforded to trade marks as it can be registered through collective trade marks and also through [[certification mark]]s, i.e., in the United States of America.

GI protection systems restrict the use of the GIs for the purpose of identifying a particular type of product, unless the product and/or its constituent materials and/or its fabrication method originate from a particular area and/or meet certain standards. Sometimes these laws also stipulate that the product must meet certain quality tests that are administered by an association that owns the exclusive right to license or allow the use of the indication. As GIs are recognised through public or private law, - depending on the GI protection system applied among the different WTO state members, either through common law or sui generis law,- the conflicts between prior trade mark registration and GIs is an international debate that is yet to be resolved and what makes the GI system rather positional in terms of international trade negotiations. These conflicts are generally resolved through three intellectual property protection approaches: first in time -first in right approach, coexistence approach, GI superiority approach.

Arguably trade marks are seen as a valuable asset in terms of private business and their economic assets while GIs are strongly connected to socio-economic development, along the lines of sustainability in countries rich in traditional knowledge.

The consumer-benefit purpose of the protection rights granted to the beneficiaries (generally speaking the GI producers), has similarities and differences to the trade mark rights:
#While GIs confer a geographical origin of a good, trade marks confer a commercial origin of an enterprise.
#While comparable goods are registered with GIs, similar goods and services are registered with trade marks.
#While a GI is a name characterised by tradition from a delineated area, a trade mark is a sign as a badge of origin for goods and services.
#While a GI is a collective entitlement of public-private partnership, a trade mark refers entirely to private rights. With GIs, the beneficiaries are always a community from which usually, regardless of who is indicated in the register as applicant, they have the right to use. Trade marks distinguish goods and services between different undertakings, thus it is more individual (except collective trade marks which are still more private).
#While with GIs its particular quality is essentially because of the geographical area, although the human factor may also play a part (collectively), with trade marks, even if there is any link to quality, it is essentially because of the producer and provider (individually).
#While GIs are an already existing expression and is used by existing producers or traders, a trade mark is usually a new word or logo chosen arbitrarily.
#While GIs are usually only for products, trademarks are for products and services.
#While GIs cannot become numerous by definition, with trade marks there is no limit to the number that can be possibly be registered or used.
#While GIs may not normally qualify as trade marks because they are either descriptive or misleading and distinguish products from one region from those of another, trade marks normally do not constitute a geographical name as there is no essential link with the geographical origin of goods.
#While GIs protect names designating the origin of goods, trade marks – collective and certification marks where a GI sui generis sytem exists – protect signs or indications.
#While with GIs there is no conceptual uniform approach of protection (public law and private law / sui generis law and common law), the trade mark concepts of protection are practically the same in all countries of the world (i.e., basic global understanding of the Madrid System). In other words, with GIs there is no international global consensus for protection other than TRIPS.
#While with GIs the administrative action is through public law, the enforcement by the interested parties of trade marks is through private law.
#While GIs lack a truly global registration system, trade marks global registration system is through the Madrid Agreement and Protocol.
#While GIs are very attractive for developing countries rich in traditional knowledge, the new world, e.g., Australia, with a different industry development model they are more prone to benefit from trade marks. In the new world, GI names from abroad arrive through immigrants and colonisation, leading to generic names deriving from the GIs from the old world.
 
Geographical indications have other similarities with trade marks. For example, they must be registered in order to qualify for protection, and they must meet certain conditions in order to qualify for registration. One of the most important conditions that most governments have required before registering a name as a GI is that the name must not already be in widespread use as the generic name for a similar product. Of course, what is considered a very specific term for a well-known local specialty in one country may constitute a generic term or [[Generic trademark|genericized trademark]] for that type of product. For example, ''parmigiano'' cheese in Italy is generically known as ''Parmesan'' cheese in [[Australia]] and the [[United States]].

==Rural development effects==

Geographical indications are generally traditional products, produced by rural, marginal or indigenous communities over generations, that have gained a reputation on the local, national or international market due to their specific unique qualities.

The recognition and protection on the markets of the names of these products allows the community of producers to invest in maintaining the specific qualities of the product on which the reputation is built. Most importantly, as the reputation spreads beyond borders and demand grows, investment should be driven to the environment sustainability where these products originate and are produced. The application of circular economy will ensure socio-economic returns in the long-run to avoid growth at an environmental cost. This approach for GI development may also allow for investment together with  promoting the reputation of the product along the lines of sustainability when and where possible.

Rural development impacts from geographical indications, referring to environmental protection, economic development and social well-being, can be:
*the strengthening of sustainable local food production and supply (except for non-agricultural GIs such as handicrafts);
*a structuring of the supply chain around a common product reputation linked to origin;
*greater bargaining power to raw material producers for better distribution so as for them to receive a higher retail price benefit percentage;
*capacity of producers to invest economic gains into higher quality to access niche markets, improving circular economy means throughout the value chain, protection against infringements such as free-riding from illegitimate producers, etc.;
*economic resilience in terms of increased and stabilised prices for the GI product to avoid the commodity trap through de-commodisation, or to prevent/minimise external shocks affecting the premium price percentage gains (usually varying from 20-25%);
*added value throughout the supply chain;
*spill-over effects such as new business and even other GI registrations;
*preservation of the natural resources on which the product is based and therefore protect the environment;
*preservation of traditions and traditional knowledge;
*identity based prestige;
*linkages to tourism.

None of these impacts are guaranteed and they depend on numerous factors, including the process of developing the geographical indications, the type and effects of the association of stakeholders, the rules for using the GI (or Code of Practice), the inclusiveness and quality of the collective dimension decision making of the GI producers association and quality of the marketing efforts undertaken.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==International issues==

Like trade marks, geographical indications are regulated locally by each country because conditions of registration such as differences in the generic use of terms vary from country to country. This is especially true of food and beverage names which frequently use geographical terms, but it may also be true of other products such as carpets (e.g. '[[Shiraz]]'), handicrafts, flowers and perfumes.

When products with GIs acquire a reputation of international magnitude, some other products may try to pass themselves off as the authentic GI products. This kind of competition is often seen as unfair, as it may discourage traditional producers as well as mislead consumers. Thus the European Union has pursued efforts to improve the protection of GI internationally. Inter alia, the European Union has established distinct legislation to protect geographical names in the fields of wines, spirits, agricultural products including beer. A register for protected geographical indications and denominations of origin relating to products in the field of agriculture including beer, but excluding mineral water, was established (DOOR). Another register was set up for wine region names, namely the E-Bacchus register. A register of the geographical indications for spirits and for any other products is still missing in the European Union and most other countries in the world. A
private database project (GEOPRODUCT directory) intends to close this gap. Accusations of 'unfair' competition should although be levelled with caution since the use of GIs sometimes comes from European immigrants who brought their traditional methods and skills with them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agritrade.cta.int/en/content/view/full/1794 Geographical Indications and the challenges for ACP countries, by O'Connor and Company]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris convention and Lisbon agreement===

[[International trade]] made it important to try to harmonize the different approaches and standards that governments used to register GIs. The first attempts to do so were found in the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention]] on trademarks (1883, still in force, 176 members), followed by a much more elaborate provision in the 1958 [[Lisbon Agreement on the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their Registration]]. 28 countries are parties to the Lisbon agreement: Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Congo, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czech Republic, North Korea, France, Gabon, Georgia, Haiti, Hungary, Iran, Israel, Italy, Macedonia, Mexico, Moldova, Montenegro, Nicaragua, Peru, Portugal, Serbia, Slovakia, Togo and Tunisia. About 9000 geographical indications were registered by Lisbon Agreement members.

===Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights===

The [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] ("TRIPS") defines "geographical indications" as indications that identify a good as "originating in the territory of a Member, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographic origin."&lt;ref name="wto.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04b_e.htm|title=WTO - intellectual property (TRIPS) - agreement text - standards|website=www.wto.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, when negotiations on the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights|TRIPS]] were concluded, governments of all WTO member countries (164 countries, as of  August 2016) had agreed to set certain basic standards for the protection of GIs in all member countries. There are, in effect, two basic obligations on WTO member governments relating to GIs in the TRIPS agreement:

# '''Article 22 of the TRIPS Agreement''' says that all governments must provide legal opportunities in their own laws for the owner of a GI registered in that country to prevent the use of marks that mislead the public as to the geographical origin of the good. This includes prevention of use of a geographical name which although literally true "falsely represents" that the product comes from somewhere else.&lt;ref name="wto.org"/&gt;
# '''Article 23 of the TRIPS Agreement''' says that all governments must provide the owners of GI the right, under their laws, to prevent the use of a geographical indication identifying wines not originating in the place indicated by the geographical indication. This applies ''even where the public is not being misled'', where there is no unfair competition and where the true origin of the good is indicated or the geographical indication is accompanied by expressions such as "kind", "type", "style", "imitation" or the like. Similar protection must be given to geographical indications identifying spirits.&lt;ref name="wto.org"/&gt;

Article 22 of TRIPS also says that governments may refuse to register a trademark or may invalidate an existing trademark (if their legislation permits or at the request of another government) if it misleads the public as to the true origin of a good. Article 23 says governments may refuse to register or may invalidate a trademark that conflicts with a wine or spirits GI whether the trademark misleads or not.

'''Article 24 of TRIPS''' provides a number of exceptions to the protection of geographical indications that are particularly relevant for geographical indications for wines and spirits (Article 23). For example, Members are not obliged to bring a geographical indication under protection where it has become a generic term for describing the product in question. Measures to implement these provisions should not prejudice prior trademark rights that have been acquired in good faith; and, under certain circumstances &amp;mdash; including long-established use &amp;mdash; continued use of a geographical indication for wines or spirits may be allowed on a scale and nature as before.&lt;ref name="wto.org"/&gt;

In the Doha Development Round of WTO negotiations, launched in December 2001, WTO member governments are negotiating on the creation of a 'multilateral register' of geographical indications. Some countries, including the EU, are pushing for a register with legal effect, while other countries, including the United States, are pushing for a non-binding system under which the WTO would simply be notified of the members' respective geographical indications.

Some governments participating in the negotiations (especially the European Communities) wish to go further and negotiate the inclusion of GIs on products other than wines and spirits under Article 23 of TRIPS. These governments argue that extending Article 23 will increase the protection of these marks in international trade. This is a controversial proposal, however, that is opposed by other governments including the United States who question the need to extend the stronger protection of Article 23 to other products. They are concerned that Article 23 protection is greater than required, in most cases, to deliver the consumer benefit that is the fundamental objective of GIs laws.

==Differences in philosophy==
One reason for the conflicts that occur between the European and United States governments is a difference in philosophy as to what constitutes a '''"genuine"''' product. In Europe, the reigning theory is that of ''[[terroir]],'' that there is a specific property of a geographical area, and that dictates a strict usage of geographical designations. Thus, anyone with [[sheep]] of the right [[breed]]s can make [[Roquefort]] cheese, if they are located in the part of France where that cheese is made, but nobody outside that part of France can make a [[blue cheese|blue]] sheep's milk cheese and call it ''Roquefort,'' even if they make it in such a way as to completely duplicate the process described in the definition of Roquefort.

By contrast, in the United States, the naming is generally considered to be a matter of [[intellectual property]]. Thus, the name '''"Grayson"''' belongs to '''''Meadowcreek Farms,''''' and they have to a right to use it as a [[trademark]]. Nobody, even in [[Grayson County, Virginia]], can call their cheese ''Grayson,'' while Meadowcreek Farms, if they bought up another farm elsewhere in the United States, even if nowhere near Grayson County, could use that name. It is considered that their need to preserve their reputation as a company is the quality guarantee.

This difference causes most of the conflict between the United States and Europe in their attitudes toward geographical names.  [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrea_Zappalaglio/publication/277867915_The_Protection_of_Geographical_Indications_Ambitions_and_Concrete_Limitations/links/557579f608ae753637500bac.pdf &lt;ref&gt;Zappalaglio 'The Protection of Geographic Indications: Ambitions and Concrete Limitations' (2013) 2 Edinburgh Student L. Rev. 89&lt;/ref&gt;]

However, there is some overlap, particularly with American products adopting a European way of viewing the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Le Goffic &amp; Zappalaglio 'The Role Played by the US Government in Protecting Geographical Indications' World Development, 2017, vol. 98, issue C, 35-44&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable of these are crops: [[Vidalia onion]]s, [[Florida]] [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s, and [[Idaho]] [[potato]]es. In each of these cases, the state governments of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Florida, and Idaho registered trademarks, and then allowed their growers&amp;mdash;or in the case of the Vidalia onion, only those in a certain, well-defined geographical area within the state&amp;mdash;to use the term, while denying its use to others. The European conception is increasingly gaining acceptance in American viticulture, as well, as vintners in the various [[American Viticultural Area]]s are attempting to form well-developed and unique identities as [[New World wine]] gains acceptance in the wine community. Finally, the United States has a long tradition of placing relatively strict limitations on its [[American whiskey|native forms]] of [[whisky|whiskey]]; particularly notable are the requirements for labeling a product "[[straight whiskey]]" (which require the whiskey to be produced in the United States according to certain standards) and the requirement, enforced by federal law and several international agreements ([[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] among them) that a product labeled [[Tennessee whiskey]] be a straight [[Bourbon whiskey]] produced in the state of [[Tennessee]].

Inversely, some European products have adopted a more American system: a prime example is the [[Newcastle Brown Ale]], which received an EU protected geographical status in 2000. When the brewery moved from Tyneside to Tadcaster in [[North Yorkshire]] (approximately 150&amp;nbsp;km away) in 2007 for economic reasons, the status had to be revoked.

'''Harriet Ann Heron''' (née '''Buttress''', ca. 1836 – 28 October 1933) was an early settler and business owner in [[Central Otago]], [[New Zealand]], and one of the few women who lived in gold mining camps during the [[Otago Gold Rush|Otago gold rush]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Southern People - A Dictionary of Otago Southland Biography|last=Thomson|first=Jane (ed.)|publisher=Longacre Press|year=1998|isbn=1 877135 11 9|location=Dunedin, New Zealand|pages=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Heron grew up in [[Deal, Kent|Deal]], Kent, England, the daughter of Thomas Buttress and Elizabeth Buttress, née Carraway. She married William Bowbyes and they emigrated to New Zealand. Bowbyes drowned at [[Timaru]] in 1860, and in the following year she married Henry Heron and moved to Dunedin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Adult life==
Heron and her husband initially lived in [[Tuapeka (New Zealand electorate)|Tuapeka]], where they ran a butcher's shop. For some time she ran the store single-handed as her husband went to Wetherstones to work on a gold mine, and then to the [[Clutha River]] area. Heron sold the business and joined her husband at the mining site, located at Fourteen Mile Beach. For their first three years there they lived in a tent, and Heron was the only woman in the camp.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Herons later built a schist and mud mortar cottage to live in, which was originally located on the shores of the Clutha River; however since the river was dammed and flooded in 1956, it now sits on the banks of [[Lake Roxburgh]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jackiegillies.co.nz/projects/mrs-herons-cottage/|title=Mrs Heron’s Cottage {{!}} Jackie Gillies + Associates {{!}} Conservation + Creative Reuse of Historic Buildings|last=|first=|website=www.jackiegillies.co.nz|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cottage is maintained by [[Heritage New Zealand]] and known locally as "Mrs Heron's Cottage."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1875 Heron and her husband moved to [[Roxburgh, New Zealand|Roxburgh]] and ran the Commercial Hotel. Henry died in 1896, and Heron continued to run the hotel alone until 1913. During that time, she had a new building constructed for the hotel, a large brick two-story building which became known as "one of the largest and most convenient hotels in Central Otago".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Cyc04Cycl-t1-body1-d5-d51-d15.html|title=Roxburgh {{!}} NZETC|website=nzetc.victoria.ac.nz|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commercial Hotel is now used for backpackers' accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.centralotagonz.com/roxburgh/roxburgh/backpackers/x,1,5002/the-commercial-hotel-backpackers.html|title=The Commercial Hotel - Backpackers {{!}} Roxburgh Backpackers Roxburgh Accommodation - Overview|last=|first=|website=www.centralotagonz.com|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father's mother "was Jewish--we think," Allen says. His father became a nonpracticing Unitarian--an agnostic, that is. Herbert's mother was an Irish Catholic,and she had her daughter and her son baptized in the church, but, like his father, Herbert abhorred the structure and the discipline of formal religion. "It's like digging potatoes," he says. "You can do it one day and then you get the idea."''&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen Jr. was raised in [[Irvington, New York]]&lt;ref name=Auletta /&gt; and graduated from [[Williams College]] in 1962 and immediately joined [[Allen &amp; Company]].

'''[[Biotechnology]]''' is the application of scientific and engineering principles to the processing of materials by biological agents to provide goods and services.&lt;ref name="bud"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bud|first1=Robert|last2=Cantley|first2=Mark F.|title=The Uses of Life: A History of Biotechnology|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London|isbn=9780521476997|pages=1, 6, 7, 30, 133, 135, 138, 141–142, 155, 171–173, 165, 167, 174, 177, &amp; 191|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGFQNf_PcPwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its inception, biotechnology has maintained a close relationship with society. Although now most often associated with the development of [[drug]]s, historically biotechnology has been principally associated with food, addressing such issues as [[malnutrition]] and [[famine]]. The history of [[biotechnology]] begins with [[Zymology|zymotechnology]], which commenced with a focus on [[brewing]] techniques for beer. By World War I, however, zymotechnology would expand to tackle larger industrial issues, and the potential of [[industrial fermentation]] gave rise to biotechnology. However, both the single-cell protein and gasohol projects failed to progress due to varying issues including public resistance, a changing economic scene, and shifts in political power.

Yet the formation of a new field, [[genetic engineering]], would soon bring biotechnology to the forefront of science in society, and the intimate relationship between the scientific community, the public, and the government would ensue. These debates gained exposure in 1975 at the [[Asilomar Conference]], where [[Joshua Lederberg]] was the most outspoken supporter for this emerging field in biotechnology. By as early as 1978, with the development of synthetic human [[insulin]], Lederberg's claims would prove valid, and the biotechnology industry grew rapidly. Each new scientific advance became a media event designed to capture public support, and by the 1980s, biotechnology grew into a promising real industry. In 1988, only five proteins from genetically engineered cells had been approved as drugs by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), but this number would skyrocket to over 125 by the end of the 1990s.

The field of genetic engineering remains a heated topic of discussion in today's society with the advent of [[gene therapy]], [[stem cell research]], [[cloning]], and [[genetically modified food]]. While it seems only natural nowadays to link pharmaceutical drugs as solutions to health and societal problems, this relationship of biotechnology serving social needs began centuries ago.

==Origins of biotechnology==
Biotechnology arose from the field of zymotechnology or zymurgy, which began as a search for a better understanding of industrial fermentation, particularly beer. Beer was an important industrial, and not just social, commodity. In late 19th-century Germany, [[brewing]] contributed as much to the gross national product as steel, and taxes on alcohol proved to be significant sources of revenue to the government.&lt;ref name="Thackray"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thackray|first1=Arnold|title=Private Science: Biotechnology and the Rise of the Molecular Sciences|date=1998|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780812234282|pages=6–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmUX5DUTldwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s, institutes and remunerative consultancies were dedicated to the technology of brewing. The most famous was the private Carlsberg Institute, founded in 1875, which employed Emil Christian Hansen, who pioneered the pure yeast process for the reliable production of consistent beer. Less well known were private consultancies that advised the brewing industry. One of these, the Zymotechnic Institute, was established in Chicago by the German-born chemist John Ewald Siebel.

The heyday and expansion of zymotechnology came in World War I in response to industrial needs to support the war. [[Max Delbrück (chemist)|Max Delbrück]] grew yeast on an immense scale during the war to meet 60 percent of Germany's animal feed needs.&lt;ref name="Thackray" /&gt; Compounds of another fermentation product, [[lactic acid]], made up for a lack of hydraulic fluid, [[glycerol]]. On the Allied side the Russian chemist [[Chaim Weizmann]] used starch to eliminate Britain's shortage of [[acetone]], a key raw material for [[cordite]], by fermenting maize to acetone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Sifniades|first1=Stylianos|last2=Levy|first2=Alan B.|title=Acetone|journal=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|date=2000|doi=10.1002/14356007.a01_079|isbn=978-3527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industrial potential of [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] was outgrowing its traditional home in brewing, and "zymotechnology" soon gave way to "biotechnology."

With food shortages spreading and resources fading, some dreamed of a new industrial solution. The Hungarian [[Károly Ereky]] coined the word "biotechnology" in Hungary during 1919 to describe a technology based on converting raw materials into a more useful product. He built a slaughterhouse for a thousand pigs and also a fattening farm with space for 50,000 pigs, raising over 100,000 pigs a year. The enterprise was enormous, becoming one of the largest and most profitable meat and fat operations in the world. In a book entitled ''Biotechnologie'', Ereky further developed a theme that would be reiterated through the 20th century: biotechnology could provide solutions to societal crises, such as food and energy shortages. For Ereky, the term "biotechnologie" indicated the process by which raw materials could be biologically upgraded into socially useful products.&lt;ref name="Fiechter"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fiechter|first1=A.|last2=Beppu|first2=T.|title=History of Modern Biotechnology I|date=2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|location=Berlin|isbn=9783540677932|pages=153 &amp; 170|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ha6RNLb_UFQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This catchword spread quickly after the First World War, as "biotechnology" entered German dictionaries and was taken up abroad by business-hungry private consultancies as far away as the United States. In Chicago, for example, the coming of [[prohibition]] at the end of World War I encouraged biological industries to create opportunities for new fermentation products, in particular a market for nonalcoholic drinks. Emil Siebel, the son of the founder of the Zymotechnic Institute, broke away from his father's company to establish his own called the "Bureau of Biotechnology," which specifically offered expertise in fermented nonalcoholic drinks.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

The belief that the needs of an industrial society could be met by fermenting agricultural waste was an important ingredient of the "chemurgic movement."&lt;ref name="Fiechter" /&gt;  Fermentation-based processes generated products of ever-growing utility. In the 1940s, [[penicillin]] was the most dramatic. While it was discovered in England, it was produced industrially in the U.S. using a deep fermentation process originally developed in Peoria, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=J. J.|last2=Grenfell|first2=E.|last3=Legge|first3=B. J.|last4=Mcallister|first4=R. C.

Doctors used the phrase "miracle drug", and the historian of its wartime use, David Adams, has suggested that to the public penicillin represented the perfect health that went together with the car and the dream house of wartime American advertising.&lt;ref name="Thackray" /&gt;  Beginning in the 1950s, fermentation technology also became advanced enough to produce [[steroids]] on industrially significant scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Capek|first1=Milantadra|last2=Oldrich|first2=Hanc|last3=Alois|first3=Capek|title=Microbial Transformations of Steroids|date=1966|publisher=Academia Publishing House of Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences|location=Prague|isbn=9789401176057|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-7603-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular importance was the improved [[semisynthesis]] of [[cortisone]] which simplified the old 31 step synthesis to 11 steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leigh|first1=H.

[[File:Penicillin cures gonorrhea.jpg|thumb|left| [[Penicillin]] was viewed as a miracle drug that brought enormous profits and public expectations.]]

==Single-cell protein and gasohol projects==
Even greater expectations of biotechnology were raised during the 1960s by a process that grew single-cell protein. When the so-called protein gap threatened world hunger, producing food locally by growing it from waste seemed to offer a solution. It was the possibilities of growing microorganisms on oil that captured the imagination of scientists, policy makers, and commerce.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Major companies such as [[British Petroleum]] (BP) staked their futures on it. In 1962, BP built a pilot plant at Cap de Lavera in Southern France to publicize its product, Toprina.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Initial research work at Lavera was done by [[Alfred Champagnat]],&lt;ref name=bamberg&gt;{{cite book|first=J. H. |last=Bamberg |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000|pages=426–428|isbn=978-0-521-78515-0|title=British Petroleum and global oil, 1950-1975: the challenge of nationalism. Volume 3 of British Petroleum and Global Oil 1950-1975: The Challenge of Nationalism, J. H. Bamberg British Petroleum series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LVC0VlPOJxEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, construction started on BP's second pilot plant at [[Grangemouth Refinery|Grangemouth Oil Refinery]] in Britain.&lt;ref name=bamberg/&gt;

As there was no well-accepted term to describe the new foods, in 1966 the term "[[single-cell protein]]" (SCP) was coined at [[MIT]] to provide an acceptable and exciting new title, avoiding the unpleasant connotations of microbial or bacterial.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

The "food from oil" idea became quite popular by the 1970s, when  facilities for growing yeast fed by n-[[Alkane|paraffin]]s were built in a number of countries. The [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] were particularly enthusiastic, opening large "BVK" (''belkovo-vitaminny kontsentrat'', i.e., "protein-vitamin concentrate") plants next to their oil refineries in [[Kstovo]] (1973) &lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0612FD3C55137B93C2A8178AD95F478785F9 Soviet Plant to Convert Oil to Protein for Feed; Use of Yeast Involved], By THEODORE SHABAD. the New York Times, November 10, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kstovo.ru/index-name-Content-op-view-id-41.html Первенец микробиологической промышленности] (Microbiological industry's first plant), in: Станислав Марков (Stanislav Markov) «Кстово – молодой город России» (''Kstovo, Russia's Young City'')&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kirishi]] (1974).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

By the late 1970s, however, the cultural climate had completely changed, as the growth in SCP interest had taken place against a shifting economic and cultural scene (136). First, the [[price of oil]] rose catastrophically in 1974, so that its cost per barrel was five times greater than it had been two years earlier. Second, despite continuing hunger around the world, anticipated demand also began to shift from humans to animals. The program had begun with the vision of growing food for Third World people, yet the product was instead launched as an animal food for the developed world. The rapidly rising demand for animal feed made that market appear economically more attractive. The ultimate downfall of the SCP project, however, came from public resistance.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

This was particularly vocal in Japan, where production came closest to fruition. For all their enthusiasm for innovation and traditional interest in microbiologically produced foods, the Japanese were the first to ban the production of single-cell proteins. The Japanese ultimately were unable to separate the idea of their new "natural" foods from the far from natural connotation of oil.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; These arguments were made against a background of suspicion of heavy industry in which anxiety over minute traces of [[petroleum]] was expressed. Thus, public resistance to an unnatural product led to the end of the SCP project as an attempt to solve world hunger.

Also, in 1989 in the USSR, the public environmental concerns made the government decide to close down (or convert to different technologies) all 8 paraffin-fed-yeast plants that the Soviet Ministry of Microbiological Industry had by that time.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In the late 1970s, biotechnology offered another possible solution to a societal crisis. The escalation in the price of oil in 1974 increased the cost of the Western world's energy tenfold.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; In response, the U.S. government promoted the production of [[gasohol]], gasoline with 10 percent alcohol added, as an answer to the energy crisis.&lt;ref name="Thackray" /&gt; In 1979, when the Soviet Union sent troops to Afghanistan, the Carter administration cut off its supplies to agricultural produce in retaliation, creating a surplus of agriculture in the U.S. As a result, fermenting the agricultural surpluses to synthesize fuel seemed to be an economical solution to the shortage of oil threatened by the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. Before the new direction could be taken, however, the political wind changed again: the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration came to power in January 1981 and, with the declining oil prices of the 1980s, ended support for the gasohol industry before it was born.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

Biotechnology seemed to be the solution for major social problems, including world hunger and energy crises. In the 1960s, radical measures would be needed to meet world starvation, and biotechnology seemed to provide an answer. However, the solutions proved to be too expensive and socially unacceptable, and solving world hunger through SCP food was dismissed. In the 1970s, the food crisis was succeeded by the energy crisis, and here too, biotechnology seemed to provide an answer. But once again, costs proved prohibitive as oil prices slumped in the 1980s. Thus, in practice, the implications of biotechnology were not fully realized in these situations. But this would soon change with the rise of [[genetic engineering]].

==Genetic engineering==
The origins of biotechnology culminated with the birth of [[genetic engineering]]. There were two key events that have come to be seen as scientific breakthroughs beginning the era that would unite genetics with biotechnology. One was the 1953 discovery of the structure of [[DNA]], by Watson and Crick, and the other was the 1973 discovery by Cohen and Boyer of a [[recombinant DNA]] technique by which a section of DNA was cut from the plasmid of an E. coli bacterium and transferred into the DNA of another.&lt;ref name="Grace" /&gt; This approach could, in principle, enable bacteria to adopt the genes and produce proteins of other organisms, including humans. Popularly referred to as "genetic engineering," it came to be defined as the basis of new biotechnology.

Genetic engineering proved to be a topic that thrust biotechnology into the public scene, and the interaction between scientists, politicians, and the public defined the work that was accomplished in this area. Technical developments during this time were revolutionary and at times frightening. In December 1967, the first heart transplant by Christian Barnard reminded the public that the physical identity of a person was becoming increasingly problematic. While poetic imagination had always seen the heart at the center of the soul, now there was the prospect of individuals being defined by other people's hearts.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;  During the same month, [[Arthur Kornberg]] announced that he had managed to biochemically replicate a viral gene. "Life had been synthesized," said the head of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Genetic engineering was now on the scientific agenda, as it was becoming possible to identify genetic characteristics with diseases such as [[beta thalassemia]] and [[sickle-cell anemia]].

Responses to scientific achievements were colored by cultural skepticism. Scientists and their expertise were looked upon with suspicion. In 1968, an immensely popular work, ''The Biological Time Bomb'', was written by the British journalist Gordon Rattray Taylor. The author's preface saw Kornberg's discovery of replicating a viral gene as a route to lethal doomsday bugs. The publisher's blurb for the book warned that within ten years, "You may marry a semi-artificial man or woman…choose your children's sex…tune out pain…change your memories…and live to be 150 if the scientific revolution doesn’t destroy us first."&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; The book ended with a chapter called "The Future – If Any." While it is rare for current science to be represented in the movies, in this period of "[[Star Trek]]", science fiction and science fact seemed to be converging. "[[Cloning]]" became a popular word in the media. [[Woody Allen]] satirized the cloning of a person from a nose in his 1973 movie ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'', and cloning [[Adolf Hitler]] from surviving cells was the theme of the 1976 novel by [[Ira Levin]], ''[[The Boys from Brazil (novel)|The Boys from Brazil]]''.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

In response to these public concerns, scientists, industry, and governments increasingly linked the power of [[recombinant DNA]] to the immensely practical functions that biotechnology promised. One of the key scientific figures that attempted to highlight the promising aspects of genetic engineering was [[Joshua Lederberg]], a Stanford professor and [[Nobel laureate]]. While in the 1960s "genetic engineering" described eugenics and work involving the manipulation of the [[human genome]], Lederberg stressed research that would involve microbes instead.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Lederberg emphasized the importance of focusing on curing living people. Lederberg's 1963 paper, "Biological Future of Man" suggested that, while molecular biology might one day make it possible to change the human genotype, "what we have overlooked is [[euphenics]], the engineering of human development."&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Lederberg constructed the word "euphenics" to emphasize changing the [[phenotype]] after conception rather than the [[genotype]] which would affect future generations.

With the discovery of [[recombinant DNA]] by Cohen and Boyer in 1973, the idea that genetic engineering would have major human and societal consequences was born. In July 1974, a group of eminent molecular biologists headed by Paul Berg wrote to ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' suggesting that the consequences of this work were so potentially destructive that there should be a pause until its implications had been thought through.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; This suggestion was explored at a meeting in February 1975 at California's Monterey Peninsula, forever immortalized by the location, [[Asilomar Conference Grounds|Asilomar]]. Its historic outcome was an unprecedented call for a halt in research until it could be regulated in such a way that the public need not be anxious, and it led to a 16-month moratorium until [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) guidelines were established.

[[Joshua Lederberg]] was the leading exception in emphasizing, as he had for years, the potential benefits. At [[Asilomar Conference Grounds|Asilomar]], in an atmosphere favoring control and regulation, he circulated a paper countering the pessimism and fears of misuses with the benefits conferred by successful use. He described "an early chance for a technology of untold importance for diagnostic and therapeutic medicine: the ready production of an unlimited variety of human [[proteins]]. Analogous applications may be foreseen in [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] process for cheaply manufacturing essential nutrients, and in the improvement of [[microbes]] for the production of [[antibiotics]] and of special industrial chemicals."&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; In June 1976, the 16-month moratorium on research expired with the Director's Advisory Committee (DAC) publication of the NIH guidelines of good practice. They defined the risks of certain kinds of experiments and the appropriate physical conditions for their pursuit, as well as a list of things too dangerous to perform at all. Moreover, [[modified organisms]] were not to be tested outside the confines of a laboratory or allowed into the environment.&lt;ref name="Grace" /&gt;

[[File:Insulincrystals.jpg|thumb|Synthetic [[insulin]] crystals synthesized using [[recombinant DNA]] technology]]

Atypical as Lederberg was at Asilomar, his optimistic vision of [[genetic engineering]] would soon lead to the development of the biotechnology industry. Over the next two years, as public concern over the dangers of [[recombinant DNA]] research grew, so too did interest in its technical and practical applications. Curing genetic diseases remained in the realms of science fiction, but it appeared that producing human simple proteins could be good business. [[Insulin]], one of the smaller,  best characterized and understood proteins, had been used in treating [[type 1 diabetes]] for a half century. It had been extracted from animals in a chemically slightly different form from the human product. Yet, if one could produce synthetic [[human insulin]], one could meet an existing demand with a product whose approval would be relatively easy to obtain from regulators. In the period 1975 to 1977, synthetic "human" insulin represented the aspirations for new products that could be made with the new biotechnology. Microbial production of synthetic human insulin was finally announced in September 1978 and was produced by a startup company, [[Genentech]].&lt;ref name="Krimsky"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krimsky|first1=Sheldon|title=Biotechnics &amp; society: the rise of industrial genetics|date=1991|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|isbn=9780275938598|pages=18, &amp; 21|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8-XbAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=027593859X&amp;dq=027593859X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although that company did not commercialize the product themselves, instead, it licensed the production method to [[Eli Lilly and Company]].  1978 also saw the first application for a patent on a gene, the gene which produces [[human growth hormone]], by the [[University of California]], thus introducing the legal principle that genes could be patented. Since that filing, almost 20% of the more than 20,000 genes in the human DNA have been patented.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The radical shift in the connotation of "genetic engineering" from an emphasis on the inherited characteristics of people to the commercial production of proteins and therapeutic drugs was nurtured by Joshua Lederberg. His broad concerns since the 1960s had been stimulated by enthusiasm for science and its potential medical benefits. Countering calls for strict regulation, he expressed a vision of potential utility. Against a belief that new techniques would entail unmentionable and uncontrollable consequences for humanity and the environment, a growing consensus on the economic value of recombinant DNA emerged.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Biotechnology and industry==
[[File:South San Francisco gateway sign.jpg|thumb|right|A Genentech-sponsored sign declaring South San Francisco to be "The Birthplace of Biotechnology."]]
With ancestral roots in [[industrial microbiology]] that date back centuries, the new biotechnology industry grew rapidly beginning in the mid-1970s. Each new scientific advance became a media event designed to capture investment confidence and public support.&lt;ref name="Krimsky" /&gt;  Although market expectations and social benefits of new products were frequently overstated, many people were prepared to see genetic engineering as the next great advance in technological progress. By the 1980s, biotechnology characterized a nascent real industry, providing titles for emerging trade organizations such as the [[Biotechnology Industry Organization]] (BIO).

The main focus of attention after insulin were the potential profit makers in the pharmaceutical industry: [[human growth hormone]] and what promised to be a miraculous cure for viral diseases, [[interferon]]. [[Cancer]] was a central target in the 1970s because increasingly the disease was linked to viruses.&lt;ref name="Grace"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grace|first1=Eric S.|title=Biotechnology Unzipped:: Promises and Realities|date=2006|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780309096218|pages=78 &amp; 155|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NtOv07UmQgAC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1980, a new company, [[Biogen]], had produced [[interferon]] through recombinant DNA. The emergence of interferon and the possibility of curing cancer raised money in the community for research and increased the enthusiasm of an otherwise uncertain and tentative society. Moreover, to the 1970s plight of cancer was added [[AIDS]] in the 1980s, offering an enormous potential market for a successful therapy, and more immediately, a market for diagnostic tests based on monoclonal antibodies.&lt;ref name="Colwell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rita R|first1=Colwell|title=Fulfilling the promise of biotechnology|journal=Biotechnology Advances|date=2002|volume=20|issue=3–4|pages=215–228|doi=10.1016/S0734-9750(02)00011-3|pmid=14550029}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1988, only five proteins from genetically engineered cells had been approved as drugs by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA): synthetic [[insulin]], [[human growth hormone]], [[hepatitis B vaccine]], [[alpha-interferon]], and [[tissue plasminogen activator]] (TPa), for lysis of blood clots. By the end of the 1990s, however, 125 more genetically engineered drugs would be approved.&lt;ref name="Colwell" /&gt;

The 2007–2008 [[global financial crisis]] led to several changes in the way the biotechnology industry was financed and organized. First, it led to a decline in overall financial investment in the sector, globally; and second, in some countries like the UK it led to a shift from business strategies focused on going for an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) to seeking a [[trade sale]] instead.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Birch|first=Kean|date=2016-08-10|title=Rethinking Value in the Bio-economy|journal=Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=460–490|doi=10.1177/0162243916661633|pmid=28458406|pmc=5390941}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, financial investment in the biotechnology industry started to improve again and by 2014 the global market capitalization reached $1 trillion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Genetic engineering also reached the agricultural front as well. There was tremendous progress since the market introduction of the genetically engineered [[Flavr Savr tomato]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="Colwell" /&gt;  Ernst and Young reported that in 1998, 30% of the U.S. soybean crop was expected to be from genetically engineered seeds. In 1998, about 30% of the US cotton and corn crops were also expected to be products of [[genetic engineering]].&lt;ref name="Colwell" /&gt;

Genetic engineering in biotechnology stimulated hopes for both therapeutic proteins, drugs and biological organisms themselves, such as seeds, pesticides, engineered yeasts, and modified human cells for treating genetic diseases. From the perspective of its commercial promoters, scientific breakthroughs, industrial commitment, and official support were finally coming together, and biotechnology became a normal part of business. No longer were the proponents for the economic and technological significance of biotechnology the iconoclasts.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Their message had finally become accepted and incorporated into the policies of governments and industry.

==Global trends==
{{Refimprove|date=November 2006}}
According to Burrill and Company, an industry investment bank, over $350 billion has been invested in biotech since the emergence of the industry, and global revenues rose from $23 billion in 2000 to more than $50 billion in 2005. The greatest growth has been in [[Latin America]] but all regions of the world have shown strong growth trends.  By 2007 and into 2008, though, a downturn in the fortunes of biotech emerged, at least in the United Kingdom, as the result of declining investment in the face of failure of biotech pipelines to deliver and a consequent downturn in return on investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pearson |first=Sue |date=2008-08-01 |title=Is the U.K. Biotech Industry on the Skids? |journal=Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News |volume=28 |issue=14 |pages=12–13 |url=http://www.genengnews.com/articles/chitem.aspx?aid=2546&amp;chid=0 |issn=1935-472X|accessdate =2008-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Incremental profit''' is the [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] gain or loss associated with a given [[management|managerial]] decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unf.edu/~dtanner/dtch/dt_ch11.htm|title=incremental analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total profit increases so long as incremental profit is positive. When incremental profit is negative, total profit declines. Similarly, incremental profit is positive (and total profit increases) if the incremental [[revenue]] associated with a decision exceeds the incremental cost. The incremental concept is so intuitively obvious that it is easy to overlook both its significance in managerial decision making and the potential for difficulty in correctly applying it.&lt;br /&gt;
For this reason, the incremental concept is sometimes violated in practice. For example, a firm may refuse to sublet excess [[warehouse]] space for $5000 per month because it figures its cost as $7500 per month -a price paid for a long-term lease on the facility. However, if the warehouse space represents excess capacity with no current value to the company, its historical cost of $7500 per month is irrelevant and should be disregarded. The firm would forego $5000 in profits by turning down the offer to sublet the excess warehouse space. Similarly, any firm that adds a standard allocated charge for fixed costs and overhead to the true incremental cost of production runs the risk of turning down profitable business.

The '''Indian Civil Accounts Service'''(ICAS)([[Hindi]]: '''भारतीय सिविल लेखा सेवा'''  ''Bharatiya Civil Lekha Seva'' ) is one of the [[Civil Services of India]] ("Group A"). ICAS functions under the Department of Expenditure in the Union Ministry of Finance. The service was created consequent to the Departmentalisation in 1976 with the purpose of separating Auditing and Accounting functions of the Union Government. The initial intake into the ICAS was by deputing and transferring the personnel from [[Indian Audits and Accounts Service|Indian Audit and Accounts Department]]. Since 1977, direct recruits to ICAS are selected from the [[Civil Services Examination]] conducted by [[Union Public Service Commission]], through which recruitment to all other Central Civil Services is made.

==Profile==
Indian Civil Accounts Organisation performs a key role in delivery of financial management services for the Government of India. The organisation provides payment services, supports the tax collection system, performs government wide accounting, financial reporting functions, preparation of budget estimates and carries out Internal Audit in civil ministries of the Union Government. [http://cga.nic.in/default.aspx Controller General of Accounts (CGA)] in Ministry of Finance heads the organisation and is responsible for administering this system. The vast expertise available with the ICAS is utilised by the government at various levels of decision making as well as by [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) in a number of countries for advising on financial management and accounting functions.

This service has sanctioned cadre strength of 226 officers who are supported by around 9000 employees professionally qualified in government accounting system.

==Training==
Officers of ICAS are trained in three stages. For the first 6 months, they are trained at [http://www.nifm.ac.in/ National Institute of Financial Management] (NIFM), [[Faridabad]]  along with officers of Indian Defence Accounts Services, Indian Postal-Telecom Accounts and Finance Services. During NIFM training, they are also taken abroad for a foreign country exposure. In 2011, it was Manchester and in 2012, Malaysia and Singapore and in 2013 &amp; 2014, University of California,Riverside, USA.

From 2015 batch onwards, the officer trainees are going for foreign attachment with Seneca college, Toronto , Canada.

After NIFM, training office of CGA attaches ICAS officers to the Institute of Government Accounts and Finance [http://www.Ingaf.in &amp;#91;INGAF&amp;#93;]. In their third stage of training, ICAS officers are sent for On-The-Job-Training (OJT) from INGAF. 

Founded in 1992, INGAF is defined by its excellence in the field of public policy, finance, audit and management. Its programs attract professionals from not only the Central Government, but the state governments and union territories, public sector undertakings and autonomous bodies and banks.  Its main campus is located in the heart of the national capital - Delhi, adjacent to the premier [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]]. INGAF has four regional training centres at [[Mumbai]], [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]] and [[Aizawl]], equipped with multi-media lecture theatres and computing and information technology services. 

Its faculty is drawn from a committed team of experienced professionals, blending leading edge practices with rigorous academic analysis. 

It has also fostered partnerships with institutes of eminence for joint initiatives at curriculum development, academic research and training.

'''Professional Programs'''

INGAF conducts more than 300 intensive professional programs every year aimed at senior and middle level of management in the Civil Accounts organization and other interested central organizations, autonomous bodies, banking institutions, state governments and union territories. It conducts training at the induction and entry level, together with professional skill up-gradation at the middle and senior management levels covering about 5000 participants every year.

'''International Programs'''

INGAF conducts regular customized programs on different aspects of Information Technology, Internal Audit, and Public Financial Management for countries in the SAARC region. It has been proactive in addressing the training needs of the member countries of the Association of Government Accounts Organisations of Asia (AGAOA) through exchange of ideas, and conducting of study programs blending best practices with a strategic understanding of the issues involved in managing change.  INGAF also conducts programs for member-countries of the [[Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme|Indian Technical &amp; Economic Cooperation]] [ITEC] and Special Commonwealth Assistance for Africa [SCAAP] consortium.  Its current global footprint extends to well over a 100 countries in the East European, African, Middle Eastern, Latin American, and Asian regions.

== Organisational Structure ==
Indian Civil Accounts Organisation is headed by [http://cga.nic.in/default.aspx Controller General of Accounts (CGA)] in the Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance. CGA as the central accounting and reporting agency for Government of India and is assisted by officers of Indian Civil Accounts Service.
As per the Departmentalised accounting arrangements in government, operational responsibility for accounting, reporting and internal audit function in civil ministries is with the ICAS officers. These units are headed by the Principal Chief Controller of Accounts (Pr. CCA), Chief Controller of Accounts (CCA) or a Controller of Accounts (CA) in the respective ministries. Under the overall supervision of CGA, they assist the Secretary of the Ministry who is the chief accounting authority in the ministry. The Pr.CCAs / CCAs / CAs discharge their duties and responsibilities through the Principal Accounts Office (Pr. AO) at Ministry's headquarters and Pay and Accounts Offices (PAOs) at the field formation level. There are currently 358 PAOs located at 87 stations across the country.

== Administration ==
The cadre management of Group 'A' officers of the Indian Civil Accounts Service (ICAS) vests with the Controller General of Accounts. It covers the entire gamut of personnel management of ICAS officers including their recruitment, transfers, promotions, training, both within the country as well as abroad, and periodical reviews of cadre strength and distribution.

The respective Chief Controller/ Controller of Accounts controls the Group 'C' &amp; 'D' staff of various Civil Accounts Units. However, a combined seniority list of all the employees within these grades is maintained by the Controller General of Accounts for effecting promotions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4640">The '''International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities''' ('''ISIC''') is a [[United Nations]] [[industry classification]] system. Wide use has been made of ISIC in classifying data according to kind of economic activity in the fields of employment and health data.

It is maintained by the [[United Nations Statistics Division]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://unstats.un.org/unsd/classifications/]&lt;/ref&gt;

ISIC classifies entities by activity. The most detailed categories are defined by combinations of activities described in statistical units, considering the relative importance of the activities included in these classes.

ISIC Rev.4 continues to use criteria such as input, output and use of the products produced, but places additional emphasis on production processes.

== Revision history ==

The United Nations Statistics Division has published the following revisions of the ISIC standard:
* Revision 1 - Published in 1958&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.investmentmap.org/industry_classification.aspx International Trade Center Investment Map]"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4837">'''Jezdimir Vasiljević''' (born in Topolovnik, [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|People's Republic of Serbia]], [[Yugoslavia]] in November 1948), nicknamed '''Gazda Jezda''' ("Jezda the Boss"), is a controversial Serbian businessman. According to some sources, his initial investment capital was made through a marriage with a Swedish woman from a wealthy family.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vreme.co.rs/cms/view.php?id=935208, Vreme&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, he established the [[Jugoskandik]] Savings Bank, the first privately owned bank in [[Serbia]] (which was, at the time, still a republic within [[Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslavia]]). Although Jugoskandik operated in Serbia, the banking license was provided by ''Banka Privatne Privrede'' (BPP), bank owned by the local government of [[Montenegro]] (another republic within [[Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslavia]]). He unsuccessfully ran for President of Serbia on the 1992 elections.

Vasiljević also organized and sponsored the [[Fischer–Spassky (1992 match)|1992 match between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky]], which took place in the exclusive resort of [[Sveti Stefan]] and drew significant media attention both in Yugoslavia and abroad. Since Yugoslavia was under UN sanctions at the time, participation at the match has caused [[Bobby Fischer]] legal trouble and practically forced him to live as an [[émigré]].&lt;ref&gt;http://arhiva.nacional.hr/clanak/14135/posljednje-utociste-za-poludjelog-velemajstora, Nacional&lt;/ref&gt;

Jugoskandik itself was merely a front for a [[pyramid scheme]]. The obtained money was used to bypass internationally-imposed sanctions and import oil into Yugoslavia via Montenegrin seaports. The oil was later sold within Yugoslavia (mostly in Serbia), and Jugoskandik savers were paid off from the profit. According to Vasiljević's own words, at the request of BPP's CEO Milorad Vukotić, some 62,000 tons of oil were confiscated from the Montenegrin repositories in [[Bar]] and [[Kotor]], a move which marked the end of Jugoskandik. The Jugoskandik collapse, together with the almost simultaneous collapse of another pyramidal bank, ''Dafiment'', represented a disastrous blow to the Serbian economy, already weakened by the [[Yugoslav Wars]]. Estimated 80,000 people have been left without their money.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kurir.rs/vesti/drustvo/2662929/opljackao-stedise-sad-nema-ni-za-cigarete-gazda-jezda-posle-farme-2013-nestao-evo-gde-je-sada Kurir.rs&lt;/ref&gt; Vasiljević sued the state of Montenegro in 1993, but without success.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.novimagazin.rs/vesti/gazda-jezda-tvrdi-da-je-finansirao-spo, Novi magazin&lt;/ref&gt; He fled Yugoslavia on the 8th of March 1993.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vreme.co.rs/arhiva_html/529/02.html Vreme&lt;/ref&gt; 

Vasiljević made claims that, in early 1993, he supplied the Serbian side in the [[Yugoslav wars]] with a "Hertz-machine", allegedly a machine which kills people via phone by emitting strong frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;http://nin.co.rs/2001-03/01/16794.html NIN&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vreme.co.rs/cms/view.php?id=935208&lt;/ref&gt; Such claims were almost immediately debunked by the Serbian media. 

In 2001, Vasiljević and the PBB's ex-CEO were charged separately for embezzlement. In 2004, Vasiljević's trial began in front of the Serbian court of law; he escaped to the [[Netherlands]], where he was arrested and extradited to Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blic.rs/vesti/hronika/gazda-jezda-uhapsen-u-holandiji/hrkdj1b, Blic Online&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to five years of prison.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/24907612.html, Radio Slobodna Evropa&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2013, Vasiljević entered the popular reality show "Farma", but was kicked off due to low votes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraf.rs/jetset/847343-farma-gazda-jezda-izbacen-iz-rijalitija&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, doctors found damage to the [[retina]] of his right eye, which if it worsened could have led to [[retinal detachment]], and he underwent surgery to correct the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sina.com.hk/news/20130813/-2-3040348/1.html |title=梁繼昌扮酷有苦衷 |work=[[Ming Pao]] |date=13 August 2013 |accessdate=13 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726033815/http://news.sina.com.hk/news/20130813/-2-3040348/1.html |archivedate=26 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* American economist [[Henry George]] advocated for a [[citizen's dividend]] paid for by a [[Land value tax|land tax]] in 1871 and in his 1885 speech "The Crime of Poverty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|last=George|first=Henry|author-link=Henry George|location=[[Burlington, Iowa]]|title=The Crime of Poverty|website=history.msu.edu|publisher=[[Michigan State University]]|date=April 1, 1885|url=http://history.msu.edu/history201/files/2013/12/The_Crime_of_Poverty.pdf|access-date=March 23, 2018|quote=As an English friend of mine puts it: No taxes and a pension for everybody; and why should it not be? To take land values for public purposes is not really to impose a tax, but to take for public purposes a value created by the community. And out of the fund which would thus accrue from the common property, we might, without degradation to anybody, provide enough to actually secure from want all who were deprived of their natural protectors or met with accident, or any man who should grow so old that he could not work. All prating that is heard from some quarters about its hurting the common people to give them what they do not work for is humbug. The truth is, that anything that injures self-respect, degrades, does harm; but if you give it as a right, as something to which every citizen is entitled to, it does not degrade.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="76031">This is a '''list of companies founded by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] alumni''', including attendees who enrolled in degree-programs at MIT but did not eventually graduate. This list is not exhaustive, as it only includes notable [[Company|companies]] &lt;!-- i.e. having articles on Wikipedia, but we don't reference Wikipedia within Wikipedia--&gt; of which the founding and development history is well recorded by reliable sources. In particular, [[Subsidiary|subsidiaries]] are listed with their owners in parentheses.

MIT is one of the leading universities worldwide in attracting funding for [[Startup company|start-up companies]], and its alumni have founded numerous companies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/facts/entrepreneurship.html|title=MIT Facts 2018: Entrepreneurship and Innovation|website=web.mit.edu|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbinsights.com/research/university-entrepreneurship-report/|title=The University Entrepreneurship Report – Alumni of Top Universities Rake in $12.6 Billion Across 559 Deals|date=2012-10-29|work=CB Insights Research|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.graphicsprings.com/founders-funding-and-exit-ranking-usa|title=Founders Funding And Exit Ranking Usa {{!}} GraphicSprings|work=Founders Funding And Exit Ranking Usa {{!}} GraphicSprings|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/compaines-founded-by-mit-grads-2014-8#|title=17 Companies You Didn't Know Were Founded By MIT Grads|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[PitchBook Data|PitchBook]],  from 2006 to 2017, MIT produced 907 company founders as alumni or current students, creating 780 companies, third most among all universities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://files.pitchbook.com/website/files/pdf/PitchBook_Universities_Report_2017-2018_Edition.pdf|title=Universities Report: The top 50 universities producing VC-backed entrepreneurs (2017-2018)|last=|first=|date=|website=PitchBook|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://files.pitchbook.com/pdf/PitchBook_Universities_Report_2016-2017_Edition.pdf|title=Universities Report: The top 50 universities producing VC-backed entrepreneurs (2016-2017)|last=|first=|date=|website=PitchBook|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to a report of [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] in 2015, some 30,000 companies founded by MIT alumni were active, employing 4.6 million people and producing annual revenues of $1.9 [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]], roughly equivalent to the 10th-largest economy in the world (2014).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/innovate/entrepreneurship2015.pdf|title=Entrepreneurship and Innovation at MIT (December 2015)|last=|first=|date=|website=M.I.T|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 40% of MIT founders are serial entrepreneurs, starting multiple companies, and 23% of MIT alumni’s new companies are founded outside the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In this list, founders of a company which [[merged]] with other companies to form a new company are counted as founders of the new company. However, founders of a company which later dissolved into several successor companies are ''not'' counted as founders of those successor companies; this same rule applies to [[Spin-off (corporate)|spin-off companies]]. Finally, a defunct company is a company that stopped functioning completely (e.g., [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]]) without dissolving, merging or being [[Acquisitions|acquired]].

==Brightstar==
[[Brightstar Corporation|Brightstar]] was founded in Miami in 1997, as a distributor and service provider to the wireless industry with a focus on the Latin American market.  The company opened offices in Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and the Caribbean. In 2000, the company entered distribution agreement with Motorola for all of Latin America. This was followed by the launch of subsidiaries in Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and El Salvador. A US Brightstar subsidiary opened in 2001, based in Chicago, and later expanded into Asia, followed by Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Brightstar operates in approximately 50 countries and all six continents around the globe. ''Forbes Magazine'' recognized it as one of the largest privately held companies in the US, listing it 55th in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Forbes America's Largest Private Companies 2013|url=https://www.forbes.com/largest-private-companies/#page:6_sort:0_direction:asc_search: }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Inc.

On October 18, 2013, Brightstar Corp. ("Brightstar") and SOFTBANK CORP. ("SoftBank") (TSE: 9984) announced a definitive agreement for SoftBank to invest $1.26 billion in Brightstar. (The transaction closed in January 2014.)

In December 2013, Brightstar announced plans to acquire 20:20 Mobile in Europe. The transaction closed in February 2014 and Brightstar now owns facilities in the UK, Spain, Hungary, Portugal, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, providing products and services across 13 European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brightstar Completes Acquisition of 20:20 Mobile Group in Europe|url=http://www.brightstar.com/media/press-releases/brightstar-completes-acquisition-of-2020-mobile-group-in-europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in February 2014, Brightstar announced plans to acquire the Commerce &amp; Services Division of [[SoftBank Group]]. The transaction closed in April 2014 and as a result Brightstar became the primary global distributor for the SoftBank Selection brand mobile products, which feature more than 765 mobile accessories. The new company is expected to grow Brightstar’s presence in Japan and increase the company’s revenues by $3 billion on an annualized basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brightstar Expands Business with Acquisition of the Commerce &amp; Services Division of SoftBank Corp.|url=http://www.brightstar.com/media/press-releases/brightstar-expands-business-with-acquisition-of-the-commerce-services-divis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maurice Dodd''' (25 October 1922 – 31 December 2005) was an [[English people|English]] writer and cartoonist best known for his years spent working on ''[[The Perishers]]'' [[comic strip]] published in the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''.

==Biography==
Dodd was born in [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|Hackney]]. During the [[Second World War]] he served in the [[Royal Air Force]] as a Servicing Commando, alongside Bill Herbert.  After the war Dodd was demobilised and began to study art. He then found work in advertising and, after he won a competition to write a slogan for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Bill Herbert, by then the cartoon editor at ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'', offered Dodd the chance to take over the writing of a comic strip he had created, ''[[The Perishers]]''. Working with the artist Dennis Collins, Dodd provided rough [[Page layout|layouts]], which Collins then drew from.  

Dodd continued to work in advertising, such as on the ''[[Clunk Click Every Trip]]'' series of public information films intended to remind drivers of the benefits of wearing a [[seatbelt]]. It was while he was working on this campaign that Dodd came into contact with [[FilmFair]], a company responsible for the creation of television programmes based on [[The Wombles]] and [[Paddington Bear]]. Dodd collaborated with the company in bringing ''The Perishers'' to television. Dodd left advertising in 1980 and subsequently wrote a number of children's books.

In 1983 Collins retired, leaving Dodd to write and draw ''The Perishers'' alone until 1992, when Bill Mevin began doing all the art work for the strip.  Dodd continued working on the strip until he died, from a [[brain haemorrhage]], in [[Shepperton]] on 31 December 2005.

'''Oriental management''' is a modern management school based on both the latest and historical theories as well as practices and rules of [[management]] inside and outside China. Although similar thoughts have been proposed in the early 1970s,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-GLXB200601002.htm|title=Oriental Management Theory: Its Source,Essence and Framework--《Chinese Journal of Management》2006年01期|website=en.cnki.com.cn|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; oriental management gained traction in the early 1990s having been launched [[Su Dongshui]]. The concept is generally based on the unique traditional culture of eastern countries, especially China, and has integrated the essence of management thoughts from both the east and the west, after decades of study.&lt;ref&gt;Su Dongshui, ''Oriental Management'', Shanghai: Fudan University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The theoretical foundations of oriental management are ''Chinese Management'', ''Western Management,'' and ''Overseas Chinese Management''. It adopted an approach that is people-oriented, with a strong focus on "human morality," and "human behavior." The framework prioritizes learning, ideal behavior, governing, action, and harmony.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Utility ==
Aside from serving as a form of management standards for Chinese companies, oriental management can be useful for managers and organizations that encounter specific challenges involving ethics, conflict, and poor performance. Since it incorporates elements of [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]] and Western management theories, it is capable of creating a culture of accommodation, transformation, learning, teamwork, and respect for hierarchy, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art Of Modern Oriental Management: Applying The Chinese, Japanese And Korean Management Styles At Work|last=Ong|first=Yu Sing|publisher=World Scientific|year=2017|isbn=9789813220317|location=London|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; An understanding of oriental management can also provide people interested in doing business in China meaningful insights into the Chinese business practices and norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Oriental Corporate Culture: A Case Collection|last=Su|first=Yong|last2=Chen|first2=Lanjian|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=9783642352133|location=Heidelberg|pages=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Scope ==
The research scope of oriental management is not confined to business, but extending to almost all fields of management, including individual governance, management analysis, family governance, business governance and state governance. By exercising and implementing the "Fifteen philosophical elements", including rules of governing a state, flexibility against changes, human orientedness, application of power, pragmaticism, regarding harmony as priority, attaching importance on using tools, state governance by law, embarking on a business with credit and good faith, being well planned, stratagem in decision making, subtle using of tactics, being highly efficient and uncorrupted, being industrious in making a fortune, and entelechy with reason, the highest purpose or ultimate value of oriental management is [[harmonious society]] in which everybody fulfills his comprehensive and free development.

'''Raam Lalchand Pridhani''' ({{lang-pa|ਰਾਮ ਲਾਲਚੰਦ}} aka '''Raam Soraya''' and '''Ram Soraya''') is an entrepreneur and film producer from Indonesia. He was born in [[Surabaya]], Indonesia, 4 November 1949. He is the owner of production house Soraya Intercine Films.

Before the film industry, he was a textile importer. His career in film began as a distributor for East Java (1972 to 1982). He became a producer in the ''[[Budak Nafsu]]'' (1983) which won Best Film at the [[Indonesian Film Festival]] (FFI) 1984. The movie is the result of his own company, PT. Soraya Intercine Films. After that he made films including ''[[Sembilan Wali]]'' (1985), ''[[Permainan Yang Nakal]]'' (1986), ''[[Saya Suka Kamu Punya]]'' (1987) and others.

Soraya's career peak came after taking over production of the [[Warkop DKI]] series from [[Raam Punjabi]]'s Parkit Film. Soraya made Warkop TV series in 1995 until 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3343">'''Rubber Technology''' is the subject dealing with the transformation of [[Natural rubber|rubbers]] or [[elastomer]]s into useful products, such as [[automobile]] [[tire]]s, [[rubber mat]]s and, exercise rubber stretching bands.  The materials includes [[latex]], [[natural rubber]], [[synthetic rubber]] and other polymeric materials, such as [[thermoplastic elastomer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Rubber|url=http://www.industrialrubbergoods.com/types-of-rubber.html|publisher=Industrial Rubber Goods|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubber processed through such methods are components of a wide range of items.

==Vulcanization==
Most rubber products are [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]], a process which involves heating with a small quantity of sulphur (or equivalent [[Cross-link|cross-linking agent]]) so as to stabilise the polymer chains, over a wide range of temperature. This discovery was made by [[Charles Goodyear]] in the 1844, but is a process restricted to polymer chains having a [[Double bond]] in the backbone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Vulcanized Rubber?|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-vulcanized-rubber.htm|publisher=WiseGEEK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such materials include [[natural rubber]] and [[polybutadiene]]. The range of materials available is much wider however, since all polymers become elastomeric above their [[Glass transition]] temperature. However, the elastomeric state is unstable because chains can slip past one another resulting in [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] or [[stress relaxation]] under static or dynamic load conditions. Chemical cross links add the stability to the network that is needed for most practical applications.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Processing of rubber==
[[File:Calender machine.jpg|thumb|right|220px| Milling to soften raw rubber and mix dry ingredients into the compound]]
Methods for processing rubber include [[mastication]] and various operations like mixing, [[calendering]], [[extrusion]], all processes being essential to bring crude rubber into a state suitable for shaping the final product. The former breaks down the polymer chains, and lowers their [[molecular mass]] so that [[viscosity]] is low enough for further processing. After this has been achieved, various additions can be made to the material ready for cross-linking. Rubber may be masticated on a two-roll mill or in an [[industrial mixer]], which come in different [[Industrial Mixer#Types of Mixer|types]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Rubber|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/botany/rubber-info6.htm|publisher=HowStuffWorks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubber is first compounded with additives like sulfur, carbon black and accelerators. It is converted into a dough-like mixture which is called "compound" then milled int'''o''' sheets of desired thickness. Rubber may then be extruded or molded before being cured.

'''Tariq Krim''' (born October 25, 1972, in [[Paris]]) is a French serial entrepreneur, creator of [[Netvibes]] and currently the founder and [[CEO]] of [[Jolicloud]], a personal [[cloud computing|cloud content computing]] platform and Joli OS, a free [[operating system]] based on the Jolicloud platform. In 2008, he was the first French national named by the ''[[MIT Technology Review]]'' as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.&lt;ref name="MIT Technological review"&gt;{{cite news|last=Roush|first=Wade|title=2007 Young Innovators Under 35: Tariq Krim|url= https://www.technologyreview.in/TR35/Profile.aspx?Cand=T&amp;TRID=612|work=MIT Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed Chevalier de l’[[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] (Knight of the French Order of Arts and Letters) by the [[Ministry of Culture (France)|French Minister of Culture]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="Ministère de la Culture"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nomination ou promotion dans l'ordre des Arts et des Lettres janvier 2011| url=http://www.culturecommunication.gouv.fr/Ministere/Les-services-rattaches-au-Ministre/Section-des-distinctions-honorifiques/Nomination-ou-promotion-dans-l-ordre-des-Arts-et-des-Lettres-janvier-2011|accessdate=22 February 2011|newspaper=Ministère de la Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Tariq Krim spent his childhood in the historic area of Paris, [[Le Marais]]. His father was an economist and his mother a teacher. Passionate about computers from an early age (he was given his first computer at 10, and created his first [[Minitel]] server at 12 years old), Krim went on to study physics at the [[University of Paris VII]] and obtained his [[post-graduate degree]] from the [[Ecole Nationale Superieure des Telecommunications]] (ENST).&lt;ref name="Les Echos" group=""&gt;{{cite news|last=PAQUETTE|first=EMMANUEL|title=Netvibes ou la liberté donnée à l'internaute créateur |url= http://archives.lesechos.fr/archives/2007/lesechos.fr/11/22/300220474.htm|accessdate=22 November 2007|newspaper=Les Echos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
=== Journalism ===
In 1994, after meeting with [[Jean-Francois Bizot]], Krim became a writer for ''[[Novamag]]'' and wrote articles about cyberculture. He continued his career in journalism for the financial daily ''[[La Tribune]]''. First based in Paris, then in [[California]] (he opened the newspaper's [[Silicon Valley]] branch),&lt;ref name="Le Monde"&gt;{{cite news|date = 16 May 2007 |last=Brafman|first =Nathalie | title =Tariq Krim, le nouveau gourou du Web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2007/05/16/tariq-krim-le-nouveau-gourou-du-web_910806_651865.html|accessdate=17 May 2007| work=Le Monde}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krim published numerous articles on the Internet industry, including a piece on digital music distribution two years before [[Napster]] was founded.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Entrepreneurship ===

In 1999, when the internet was still in its infancy in France, Krim decided that he was done with writing about internet innovation and would just "go and do it".&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Ian|title=Netvibes, Tariq Krim|url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/nov/04/news.weekendmagazine6|accessdate=4 November 2006|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=4 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he founded what would become L8Rmedia, a consulting and publishing company specializing in digital media. Its first branch was in [[San Francisco]]; he later expanded to [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Wall Strip Chat (Video)"&gt;{{cite news|first=Lindsay|title=Wall Strip Chat Sits Down With Tariq Krim|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x34ul8_wallstrip-chat-tariq-krim_fun?start=13#from=embed|newspaper=Wall Strip Chat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main online publication, GenerationMP3 (formerly "MPTrois.com"), attracts 1.5 million readers per month.&lt;ref name="Les Echos"/&gt; and pioneered the use of [[Citizen journalism|participatory journalism]] in France.&lt;ref name=SME&gt;{{cite web|title=SME Speakers|url=http://sime.nu/speakers/tariq-krim/|work=SME Speakers}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now a leading publication on [[mp3]] technology.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In 2005, Krim created Netvibes with Florent Frémont, a developer friend. The personalized dashboard publishing platform claims over 10 million users worldwide, half of whom are in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Les Echos"/&gt; 

In 2008, Krim left as the head of the company to create Jolicloud in 2009, co-founded with Romain Huet, the company's [[Chief Technical Officer|CTO]].&lt;ref name="Wishful Thinking"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sepúlveda Schulz|first= Rodrigo| title = Interview With Tariq Krim|url=http://www.angelmendez.es/2009/04/16/interview-with-tariq-krim-jolicloud-ceo/|accessdate=16 April 2009|newspaper =Wishful Thinking}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their vision is to combine cloud technology with a simple user interface. Krim first developed Joli OS, a free operating system, which enabled users to optimise low-cost devices or recycle older computers. In 2012, Jolicloud launched an [[HTML5]]-based cloud platform.&lt;ref name="Tech Crunch"&gt;{{cite news|last=Butcher|first=Mike|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/27/jolicloud-pivots-up-organise-your-personal-cloud-life-online/|date=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jolicloud is backed by $4.2 million in [[venture capital]] funding from [[Atomico Ventures]], formed by [[Kazaa]] and [[Skype]] founders [[Niklas Zennström]] and [[Janus Friis]], and Mangrove Capital Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://plugg.eu/program/speakers/p/detail/tariq-krim|accessdate=11 March 2010|newspaper=Plugg|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527062832/http://plugg.eu/program/speakers/p/detail/tariq-krim|archivedate=27 May 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mentoring ==
In 2008, Krim co-founded ISAI, "the French tech entrepreneurs' fund", which provides seed capital for web and mobile technology startups.&lt;ref name="isai"&gt;{{cite web|title=ISAI|url=http://www.isai.fr/en/home/|website=ISAI|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISAI's co-founders are all members of France's digerati: Orianne Garcia, founder of Terrafemina.com; Pierre Kosciusko-Morizet, founder of [[Priceminister|PriceMinister]]; Ouriel Ohayon, founder of TechCrunch France and [[AppsFire]]; [[Geoffroy Roux de Bézieux]], CEO of [[Virgin Mobile]]; and Stéphane Treppoz, Chairman of the Executive Board of [[Sarenza]].&lt;ref name=01Net&gt;{{cite news|last=Chicaud|first=Sandrine|title=Six pointures du Web créent un fonds d'investissement pour les jeunes pousses| url= http://pro.01net.com/editorial/396406/six-pointures-du-web-creent-un-fonds-dinvestissement-pour-les-jeunes-pousses/|accessdate=14 November 2008| newspaper= 01Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; This combined effort has helped launch websites such as co-voiturage.fr and InstantLuxe.com. Krim has said that he has a "passion for building highly disruptive new products".&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|last= Schonfeld| first=Erick| url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/09/15/technology/disruptors_netvibes.biz2/index.htm|accessdate=20 September 2006| work=CNNMoney|title=Web users feel the 'vibes'|date=20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Net freedom ==
As one of the first French journalists equipped to write about online conundrums such as [[copyright infringement]] or [[music piracy]] piracy, Krim became an expert on the digital rights of authors.&lt;ref name="Le Monde"/&gt; He advised [[Adami (union)|Adami]], a French civil society that allocates the rights of performers. In 2004 he published a study called "[[Peer-to-Peer]], an New Business Model for Music", in which he cites another study by the French Directorate of Economic Forecasting and Analysis, which concluded that "no systematic correlation can be made between downloading and the state of the music industry".&lt;ref name="Adami Study"&gt;{{cite web|last=Krim|first=Tariq|url=http://www.irma.asso.fr/IMG/pdf/Etude-P2P-Tariq-KRIM-ADAMI.pdf|title=Le Peer to peer: Un otre modele economique pour la musique|work=Study|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thought leadership ==
Krim is a speaker at global technology and media conferences and summits. He regularly appears on mainstream media, sometimes as an "expert on the Internet" but mostly as Netvibes' charismatic founder. He is currently acknowledged as one of Europe's industry experts on [[cloud computing]] and the future of the Internet.&lt;ref name="ARCEP Colloque"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcep.fr/uploads/tx_gspublication/actes-colloque-mai-juil2011.pdf|title=Growth, Innovation, Regulation|work=Arcep|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2008, he was awarded the [[Information Technology]] for Business Creation Prize by [[Telecom ParisTech]] and its engineering association (AIST).&lt;ref name="Paris Tech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telecom-paristech.org/docs/2008101113535_08prixcreateur.pdf|title=Les lauréats Prix du Créateur d'Entreprise - Tariq Krim|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krim is one of six French personalities to have been selected as a Young Global Leader (YGL) by the [[World Economic Forum]].&lt;ref name="WEF Young Global Leaders"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/young-global-leaders/tariq-krim/index.html|title=Tariq Krim: Founder and Chief Executive Officer Jolicloud|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krim served on the [[Conseil national du numérique]] as a vice president from 2013 to 2016.

'''Wolfram Kurt Erhard Hirth''' (28 February 1900 – 25 July 1959) was a [[Germany|German]] [[gliding]] pioneer and [[sailplane]] designer. He was a co-founder of [[Schempp-Hirth]], still a renowned [[glider (sailplane)|glider]] manufacturer.&lt;ref name="Segel"&gt;Segelflugbildkalendar 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirth was born in [[Stuttgart]], the son of an engineer and tool-maker. He was the younger brother of [[Hellmuth Hirth|Hellmuth]], who founded the famous [[Hirth]] [[aircraft engine]] manufacturing company.

==Early years==
As a young man, Hirth took up gliding and was soon drawn to the [[Wasserkuppe]], then the focus of the German gliding movement, earning his pilot's licence in 1920. In 1924, Hirth lost a leg after a [[motorcycle]] accident. From then on, he would fly while wearing a wooden [[prosthesis]].&lt;ref name="SH"&gt;[http://www.schempp-hirth.com/index.php?id=46&amp;L=1 Schempp-Hirth web-site - Accessed 10 March 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; He had the [[fibula]] from his amputated leg fashioned into a cigarette holder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Flight and Flyers |journal=[[Time Magazine|Time]] |date=11 August 1930 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,740105,00.html |accessdate=2008-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, he graduated from the Technical [[University of Stuttgart]] with a diploma in engineering and began to focus on aircraft construction.&lt;ref name="Segel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SH"/&gt; Over the next decade, he would also tour the world, promoting gliding throughout [[Europe]], the [[United States]], [[Japan]], [[South America]], and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="SH"/&gt; On 10 March 1931 he gave a demonstration of glider aerobatics over New York City.&lt;ref name="Segel"/&gt; On one of these publicity trips, he suffered major injuries in a crash in [[Hungary]], requiring a hospital stay of four months. He and [[Robert Kronfeld]] were the first pilots to gain the [[FAI Gliding Commission#Badges|Silver C badge]].&lt;ref name="Segel"/&gt; He was the chief flying instructor at the [[Jeżów Sudecki|Grünau]] Gliding School in the [[Riesengebirge]] mountains, then in Germany.&lt;ref name="Segel"/&gt;  In 1933, he became the Head of the new Gliding School in [[Hornberg]].&lt;ref name="reitsch"&gt;Reitsch, Hanna (2009). ''The Sky My Kingdom: Memoirs of the Famous German World War II Test Pilot''. Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania: Casemate Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|55}}

Later in the year, he became the first to correctly identify the phenomenon of [[lee wave|wave lift]], the highest form of lift source available to soaring pilots.&lt;ref&gt;On March 10, 1933, German glider pilot Hans Deutschmann (1911–1942) was flying over the Riesen mountains in Silesia when an updraft lifted his plane by a kilometer.  The event was observed, and correctly interpreted, by German engineer and glider pilot Wolf Hirth (1900–1959), who wrote about it in:  Wolf Hirth, ''Die hohe Schule des Segelfluges'' [The advanced school of glider flight] (Berlin, Germany:  Klasing &amp; Co., 1933).  The phenomenon was subsequently studied by German glider pilot and atmospheric physicist Joachim P. Küttner (1909 -2011) in: Küttner, J. (1938) "Moazagotl und Föhnwelle" (Lenticular clouds and foehn waves), ''Beiträge zur Physik der Atmosphäre'', '''25''', 79–114, and Kuettner, J. (1959) "The rotor ﬂow in the lee of mountains." GRD [Geophysics Research Directorate] Research Notes No. 6, AFCRC[Air Force Cambridge Research Center]-TN-58-626, ASTIA [Armed Services Technical Information Agency] Document No. AD-208862.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jan. 1934, he joined Professor Georgii's South America expedition, along with [[Peter Riedel]], [[Hanna Reitsch]], and [[Heini Dittmar]], to study thermal conditions, with his sailplane "Moatzagotl".&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|65}}  While in Argentina, Wolf set a record of seventy-six successive loops.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|74}}

Wolf Hirth also took part in International Championships of Touring Aircraft [[Challenge 1929]], [[Challenge 1932]] (6th place) and [[Challenge 1934]] (13th place). After some time in the USA he returned to Germany in 1934 because of US economic depression.&lt;ref name="SH"/&gt;

==Glider company==
With the assistance of Wolf Hirth, [[Martin Schempp]] founded his own company in Göppingen in 1935: "Sportflugzeugbau Göppingen Martin Schempp". In 1938, Wolf Hirth, mainly responsible for the design work, officially became a partner in the company, which then took on the new name “Sportflugzeugbau [[Schempp-Hirth]]”.&lt;ref name="SH"/&gt; The company relocated to Kirchheim-Teck the same year.&lt;ref name="Segel"/&gt; The company first manufactured a small training glider, the [[Göppingen Gö 1]], intended to rival the [[Grunau Baby]]. The company's first real success, however, was the [[Göppingen Gö 3|Gö 3 Minimoa]], a distinctive aircraft with an elegant [[gull wing]] design that was used to break several world records and win championships around the world.

Hirth continued to direct the firm throughout [[World War II]]. In 1940 the company began manufacturing assembly parts for [[Messerschmitt Me 323]] and Me 109 and other aircraft.&lt;ref name="SH"/&gt; From 1945 the company made furniture and other wooden components for industry until glider production could begin again in 1951. He was elected President of the German Aero-Club in 1956.&lt;ref name="Segel"/&gt;

==Death==
He had a heart attack while flying his [[Vogt Lo-100]] aerobatic glider in 1959 and died in the subsequent crash.  ''Handbuch des Segelfliegens'' was published posthumously in 1963.&lt;ref name=Hirth&gt;Hirth, W., 1963, Handbuch Des Segelfliegens, Stuttgart: Franckh'sche Verlangshandlung, W. Keller &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==

In many municipalities of Baden-Württemberg roads were named after Wolf Hirth. In Bartholomä, Bettringen, Böblingen, Ditzingen, Leinzell, Leonberg, Kirchheim/Teck and Schramberg there is a Wolf-Hirth-Straße, outside of Baden-Württembergs in Gersfeld (Rhön). In Kiel-Holtenau is a Hirthstraße.&lt;ref&gt;{{Kieler Straßenlexikon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
