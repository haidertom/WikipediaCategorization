The '''Broighter Gold''' or more correctly, the '''Broighter Hoard''', is a [[hoard]] of [[gold]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] from the [[Iron Age]] of the 1st century BC that were found in 1896 by Tom Nicholl and James Morrow on farmland near [[Limavady]], in the north of [[Ireland]] (now [[Northern Ireland]]).&lt;ref name=ency/&gt; The hoard includes a {{convert|7|in|cm|adj=mid|-long}} gold boat, a gold [[torc]] and bowl and some other jewellery. A design from the hoard has been used as an image on the 1996 issue of the [[Northern Ireland]] [[One pound (British coin)|British one-pound coins]]&lt;ref name=ukpound/&gt; and the gold ship featured in a design on the last [[Éire|Irish]] one-pound coins.&lt;ref name=imint/&gt; The Broighter Collar and Broighter Ship also featured on [[definitive postage stamps of Ireland]] from 1990–1995. The [[National Museum of Ireland]], who now hold the hoard, describe the torc as the "finest example of Irish [[La Tène]] goldworking".&lt;ref name="muse"/&gt;  Replicas of the collection are kept at the [[Ulster Museum]] in [[Belfast]].

==Discovery==
The hoard was found near [[Lough Foyle]] in a field in the [[townland]] of [[Broighter]] ({{Irish place name|Brú Íochtair|lower fort}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logainm.ie/58017.aspx Broighter/Brú Íochtair] ''Placenames Database of Ireland''. Retrieved: 2011-05-31.&lt;/ref&gt; 2&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Limavady]] in [[County Londonderry]]. It was discovered by Thomas Nicholl and James Morrow&lt;ref name=lim&gt;[http://www.limavady.gov.uk/visiting/myths-and-legends/ Myths and Legends], Limavady.gov.uk, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; while working as ploughmen for Joseph L. Gibson in February 1896. They found the hoard whilst double ploughing. That means that one plough would follow the other to gain extra depth. It was estimated that the finds were buried {{convert|14|in|cm}} deep and were in close proximity to each other.

The find was taken to the farm where Maggie (later Mrs Nicholl) washed the items in a sink. At that time they did not realise they were made from gold.&lt;ref name=neill&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20558469?seq=2 The Broighter Hoard: Or How Carson Caught the Boat], Ken Neill, Archaeology Ireland, Vol. 7, No. 2 (Summer, 1993), pp. 24-26, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The hoard was eventually sold to the [[British Museum]] for six hundred pounds. It consisted of a miniature ship, complete with fittings and oars; two necklets, a bowl and a torc (or hollow collar).&lt;ref name=ency&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/irish-crafts/broighter-collar.htm |title=Broighter Collar |accessdate=24 July 2010 |work=Encyclopedia of Irish and World Art|publisher=visual-arts-cork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The find was described as a lump of mud when initially shown. Moreover, the boat had been so badly damaged by the plough that it took a goldsmith to later work out its structure.

Part of the boat, a thwart, was found a few days later and sold by Morrow's sister to a jeweller in Londonderry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/20495224 The Broighter Boat a reassessment], A.W.Farrell et al, 1975, Irish Archaeological Research Forum, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==The finds==
The gold in the hoard all has the same metallurgical character, despite the diverse styles of the pieces. Some appear to be imported, while others may be reworked or entirely remade.&lt;ref name="Wallace128-129"&gt;Wallace, 128-129&lt;/ref&gt;

===The boat===
The boat is a unique find that was measured at {{convert|7.25|in|cm}} by {{convert|3|in|cm}} and weighed {{convert|3|oz|g}}. It had benches, rowlocks, two rows of nine oars and a paddle rudder for steering. It also included tools for grappling, three forks, a yardarm and a spear.&lt;ref name=romilly&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z81vtIANeoAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Romilly+Allen's+%22Celtic+Art%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-cc8NgAIXy&amp;sig=cnSOKFyHh792o2xMC2lO1u_ZZMc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4lRLTPjhKsiOjAew99nXDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Romilly%20Allen's%20%22Celtic%20Art%22&amp;f=false Celtic Art in Pagan and Christian Times], J. Romilly Allen, 1904, p.104-5, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The tools are of much lighter design than the ship's hull and are shown in the illustration. The boat suggests that the hoard was a [[votive]] deposit to the Celtic sea god [[Manannán mac Lir]].&lt;ref name="Wallace138"&gt;Wallace, 138&lt;/ref&gt;

===The torc===
The other remarkable item was the [[torc]] or collar which is {{convert|7.5|in|cm}} in diameter with buffer terminals, using a [[mortice and tenon]] fastening. The hollow tube that made up the ring is {{convert|1.125|in|cm}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=romilly/&gt; The hinge is no longer there but it would have been required to put on the collar. The fastening consists of a "T" piece which fits into a slot as the torc is closed. A section can then be turned which captures the "T" and prevents it opening.&lt;ref name="muse"/&gt;

The design has been applied in three ways, the most common is where the classical designs of generic plants has been revealed by beating back the surrounding gold. Other areas have additional pieces attached and the background has been incised in geometric curves to add to the decoration.&lt;ref name="muse"&gt;[http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/list/8-major-pieces.aspx?article=33b0a53d-0f90-49ca-a280-16260a062a04 The Broighter Hoard] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619010812/http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/list/8-major-pieces.aspx?article=33b0a53d-0f90-49ca-a280-16260a062a04 |date=19 June 2010 }}, [[National Museum of Ireland]], accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no comparable La Tène style hollow torcs known from Ireland, although somewhat similar examples such as the [[Snettisham Torc]] are known from Britain in this period. The design on the torc can be studied easily by imagining the hollow tube as straightened and flattened. This was done in the first study of the hoard by Arthur Evans and his drawing can be seen here. The design matches other Irish pieces, and may have been a remodelling of a plainer British or [[Rhineland]] torc (the Rhineland is one possible source of the gold).&lt;ref name="Wallace128-129"/&gt;

===Bowl===
An unusual gold bowl or model cauldron which was made from a single sheet of gold was discovered. Its purpose is unclear but it was probably a model of a large cauldron, which was an important object in the feasting culture of Iron Age Europe. It had four suspension loops on the outside, not all surviving.&lt;ref name="Wallace138"/&gt; It is {{convert|3.5|in|cm}} in diameter and is about {{convert|2|in|cm}} deep. It weighs over {{convert|1|oz|g}}.&lt;ref name=cochrane/&gt;  [[Hanging bowl]]s were later to be a distinctive feature of post-Roman British and Irish art, often thought to be a speciality of Celtic areas.

===Chain necklaces===
There are two chain necklaces, using loop-in-loop technique, with clasps. One is 39.6&amp;nbsp;cm long, with triple chains, the other with a single chain but of more complicated construction. The chain technique spread from the Middle East to the Roman world, where these were probably made; the clasps match Roman and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] examples.&lt;ref name=muse/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallace139"&gt;Wallace, 139&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bar torcs===
There are also two torcs made from single twisted bars of gold, a British style. One is complete, with a diameter of 18.6&amp;nbsp;cm, the other a semi-circular fragment. Despite unusual hook-in-loop fastenings and other features, these are probably imports from what is now south-eastern England.&lt;ref name="Wallace139"/&gt;

==Ownership==
The hoard was sold by the farmer, J.L.Gibson, to a jeweller in [[Derry]] who sold it to a local [[antiquarian]], Robert Day. He sold it to the [[British Museum]] for £600. The museum had undisturbed ownership until the renowned [[Arthur Evans]] wrote a paper describing the find in 1897. The drawing of the torc design comes from this paper.&lt;ref name=neill/&gt; The [[Royal Irish Academy]] disputed the British Museum's view that it was an ancient gift to the gods and launched a long running court case. The Academy wanted the finds to be declared [[treasure trove]], that is, buried with the intention of recovery. Day, the antiquarian, was so aggrieved to have his sale disputed that he withdrew a gift he was going to make to the Irish Academy.

It was argued that the model of the boat and the "sea-horse image" on the torc when combined with the finding of nearby shells showed that the treasure had been placed in water deliberately as an offering to ancient gods. The map above shows how close the find was both to the sea and to reclaimed land where the railway then travelled. The British Museum's position was set out by Evans who had described the find as ''[[votive]]'' in his 1897 paper&amp;nbsp;– ironically something the Academy's successor, the National Museum of Ireland, now consider likely, saying on their website: "The objects may have been buried as an offering to a Celtic god, presumably during the first Century BC".&lt;ref name="muse"/&gt;

The dispute was finally settled by a court in London in 1903 in an important case where the government was represented by [[Edward Carson|Sir Edward Carson]], who was a [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] and [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General]].&lt;ref name=neill/&gt; A pivotal issue in the case were that the finds were all closely packed which was indicative of burial. It was held that the treasure was not a religious offering and was therefore forfeit to the crown.&lt;ref name="ency"/&gt; The treasure was taken to Dublin and placed in the museum there. Although some{{who|date=December 2016}} have suggested that the gold should be transferred to nearer their find-spot in what is now [[Northern Ireland]], the items remain in the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin.

==Importance==
The hoard is considered an important find. The [[National Museum of Ireland]] believes that the collar is the "finest example of Irish [[La Tène]] goldworking" in Europe. The eclecticism of the styles is comparable to that of the objects in the [[Stirling Hoard]] from Scotland, probably from a slightly earlier period. The torc was incorporated into a 1996 design for a British pound by [[Norman Sillman]]&lt;ref name=ukpound&gt;[http://www.royalmint.com/store/Historic/HPT96P.aspx 1996 Silver Piedfort £1 - Northern Irish Celtic Cross] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106224906/http://www.royalmint.com/store/Historic/HPT96P.aspx |date=6 January 2011 }}, The Royal Mint, accessed 28 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the boat was used as a basis for the design for the last pound coin ever issued by the [[Irish Mint]].&lt;ref name=imint&gt;[http://www.irishcoinage.com/K00001.HTM Millennium Pound - Silver Piedfort Proof], irishcoinage.com, accessed 28 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This coin was issued to celebrate the millennium in 2000.

'''Carcass''' are an English [[extreme metal]] band from Liverpool, which was formed in 1985. The band have gone through several line-up changes, leaving guitarist [[Bill Steer]] and bassist and vocalist [[Jeffrey Walker|Jeff Walker]] as the only constant members.

==History==
===Early days (1985–1989)===
[[Image:Carcass 30.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Jeff Walker at Gods of Metal, Bologna, Italy (2008)]]

Carcass was first formed as a school band by Bill Steer and Ken Owen that soon after disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.collideartandculture.com/#!Interview-Bill-Steer-of-Carcass/c1lt4/55251a980cf215f35a4bc3c2|title=Interview: Bill Steer of Carcass|last=Lennon|first=Andi|date=8 April 2015|website=Collide Art &amp; Culture Mag|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steer then joined the [[D-beat]] band Disattack with drummer Middie, Paul on bass and Pek on vocals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.stereogum.com/1424501/premature-evaluation-carcass-surgical-steel/franchises/premature-evaluation/|title = Premature Evaluation: Carcass Surgical Steel|last = Nelson|first = Michael|date = 2 August 2013|website = Stereogum|access-date = 2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://toughriffs.weebly.com/interviews/interview-with-carlo-regadas-devoid|title=Interview with Carlo Regadas, Devoid|website=Tough Riffs&lt;br /&gt;Magazine|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After releasing a four track demo entitled ''A Bomb Drops ...'' in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://demoarchives.com/Bands/Disattack-Eng/disattack.asp|title=Disattack - The Bomb Drops demo listing.|website=demoarchives.com|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the bass player left the band and was replaced by [[Jeffrey Walker|Jeff Walker]], formerly guitarist and vocalist of the [[Electro Hippies]]. Vocalist Andrew Pek changed his name to Sanjiv after a visit to India.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At about the same time, Bill Steer joined [[Napalm Death]] (replacing [[Justin Broadrick]]) and recorded the second side of what became Napalm Death's first album, ''[[Scum (Napalm Death album)|Scum]]''. Walker also designed the cover art for ''Scum''.

Disattack then changed its name to Carcass as the group changed musical direction. This led to a change in drummer and saw Ken Owen join the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.earache.com/bands/carcass/news_archive/carcass.html|title=Carcass: The First Interview in Five Years|date=30 May 2005|website=earache.com|access-date=2016-03-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923232451/http://www.earache.com/bands/carcass/news_archive/carcass.html#|archive-date=23 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1987, they recorded the ''Flesh Ripping Sonic Torment'' demo, the only Carcass recording featuring vocalist Sanjiv, who left shortly after. Walker, Steer and Owen shared vocal duties for the debut album, which was done in only four days. Despite the primitive production values of Carcass's debut ''[[Reek of Putrefaction]]'' (1988), with which the band was very displeased,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goddamnbastard.org/carcass/interviews/rockhard40.html|title=Carcass - Perverted Sickos|date=June 1990|publisher=Rock Hard|accessdate=30 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became a favourite of [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] DJ [[John Peel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mudrian |first=Albert |authorlink= |title=[[Choosing Death: The Improbable History of Death Metal and Grindcore]] |url= |accessdate= |year=2004 |publisher=Feral House |location=Los Angeles, CA |isbn= |page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his interest, they were asked to participate in their first [[List of Peel sessions#C|Peel Session]] in 1989, where they debuted new material for their second album. The Peel Session was released as an EP with the band members adopting [[pseudonyms]]: K. Grumegargler, J. Offalmangler, and W.G. Thorax Embalmer. Also that year, Steer and Walker appeared as members of Lister's fictional band ''Smeg and the Heads'' in an episode of [[Red Dwarf]].&lt;ref name="Pathologist's Report"&gt;Carcass - The Pathologist's Report documentary&lt;/ref&gt;

===Progress (1989–1993)===

''[[Symphonies of Sickness]]'' (1989), the second album, which contained a much improved production quality (courtesy of Colin Richardson), featured more [[death metal]] structures and longer songs with more slow passages.&lt;ref name=Purcell&gt;{{cite book|last=J.

The next album, ''Necroticism: Descanting the Insalubrious'', was pure Death Metal with intricate dynamics, complex structured songs, and refined guitar solos.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second half of the tour in support of ''Symphonies of Sickness'' saw the addition of second lead guitarist [[Michael Amott]], whose previous work included [[Carnage (band)|Carnage]]. Amott was to become a permanent member, playing on the second Peel Session and contributing material towards their third album.

''[[Necroticism – Descanting the Insalubrious]]'' (1991) showed even more intricate composition, further improved production and guitar solos.&lt;ref name=Purcell/&gt; Despite the addition of Amott to the ranks, Steer still handled all rhythm guitar duties, with Amott only contributing leads and one riff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/carcass-giving-people-what-they-want/|title=Carcass Giving People What They Want|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=18 September 2013|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carcass again supported the album with heavy touring, and were part of the Earache 'Gods of Grind' tour with [[Cathedral (band)|Cathedral]], [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]] and [[Confessor (band)|Confessor]] in both Europe and the United States. The ''[[Tools of the Trade]]'' EP was released in 1992 to coincide with the "Gods of Grind" tour.

===Columbia (1993–1995)===
[[Image:Michael Ammot.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Michael Amott at Gods of Metal, Bologna, Italy (2008)]]

The band's fourth album, ''[[Heartwork]]'', was released in late 1993. It was considered a radical change by many fans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Franklin|first=Dan|title=Can You Feel The Forceps: Carcass, Surgical Steel And Heartwork Revisited|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/13361-carcass-surgical-steel-review|publisher=[[The Quietus]]|accessdate=19 October 2013|date=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which eliminated Steer's deeper vocals and the clinically gory lyrics. Again, Steer handled all rhythm guitar duties, this time due to Amott losing his passport in Israel (thus making him unable to return to England in time to record).&lt;ref name="Pathologist's Report"/&gt; Song structures, whilst still containing musically complex parts, were simpler, in some cases using the verse/chorus/verse formula.

After the release of ''Heartwork'', Carcass signed a worldwide deal with [[Columbia Records]], who hoped for commercial success, even suggesting that Jeff Walker learn how to sing. Michael Amott left the band right after ''Heartwork'' was recorded, and was for a while replaced by Mike Hickey, who was later replaced by Carlo Regadas.

During the summer of 1994, Walker remixed the track "Inside Out" for a [[Die Krupps]] remix album, although the version stayed fairly true to the original with the exception of Owen's drum samples from ''Heartwork'' replacing the Die Krupps original, and additional mixing from Walker and Colin Richardson at Parr Street studios (where ''Heartwork'' was recorded).{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Carcass now set about writing songs for their major label debut. During the December 1994 UK tour Carcass showcased two songs from their current writing sessions – "Edge of Darkness" and "Firmhand", both showing a more straight forward song writing approach than on previous efforts.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Around this time, "Edge of Darkness" was recorded for the BBC Radio 1 Rock Show sessions – a session which could be found on later compilation albums.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

By late 1994, 17 songs were ready and the band set about using their $200,000 advance to record the album, again with Colin Richardson, at Rockfield studios in Monmouth, South Wales in early 1995. During the 6-week recording schedule the record label began to withdraw support, stating that Carcass were not ready to record, and needed to write more songs. This advice was ignored, as was the suggestion to have [[Terry Date]] remix the album, and the band continued. At the time, Jeff Walker stated in an interview with the UK's Metal Hammer Magazine that the album was taking more of a classic rock approach, with drums, bass and twin guitars à la Thin Lizzy, in comparison to earlier "multi-layered guitar" productions. This has since been put down to Bill Steer's unwillingness to perform the time consuming guitar layering (as once again Steer performed all rhythm guitar) through losing interest in the metal genre.

During the ''Swansong'' recording sessions, Carcass were asked to remix a [[Björk]] track - "[[Isobel (song)|Isobel]]". This wasn't a remix as such but more of a re-recording with only Björk's vocals remaining. The track saw the light of day in March 1996 on Björk's "[[Hyperballad]]" single.

===Demise (1996–2006)===
Continuing record company problems with Columbia/Sony caused the album to be delayed from late summer 1995 to June 1996, in which time Carcass moved back to Earache Records, and broke up before even releasing ''[[Swansong (album)|Swansong]]''. The move back to Earache was dubbed by Walker as "the second great rock and roll swindle"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kerrang!]]'',  June 1996&lt;/ref&gt; as they had effectively been paid twice for the same album. ''Swansong'' featured twelve of the seventeen tracks put to tape during the recording sessions. Walker has since stated in interviews that all seventeen songs should have been included in a double album, and that some songs omitted from ''Swansong'' were actually stronger than some of ''Swansong''{{'}}s actual content. Carcass also remixed [[Killing Joke]]'s "Democracy" (by re-recording the music, but keeping the original vocals), although this time Regadas performed all guitar duties, as it is thought Steer had quit the band by early 1996. The Carcass "Rooster Mix" was made available on Killing Joke's ''[[Democracy (album)|Democracy]]''. Around the time of ''Swansong'''s release, Carcass informed the press that they were ending the band without even a farewell tour, but most fans had guessed this may be the case via the album title.

The album sold well, staying near the top of the Indie Rock Chart in the UK for several months, above bands such as [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]], despite having no touring support from the band. It is rumoured that the band were offered several lucrative tours in 1995, such as supporting [[Iron Maiden]] on their "X-Factour 95" tour, which had the album been released as expected in 1995, could have improved the band's sales and longevity.

A posthumous compilation, ''[[Wake up and Smell the... Carcass]]'' was released in October 1996 to collect together Carcass' rarer material, including unreleased material, songs only available on EPs and compilations, and live tracks. An accompanying video was released a few weeks after the ''Wake Up'' CD with little knowledge from the band or their management. The video, later released on DVD, featured five of the band's promotional videos, a show from the Grindcrusher 1989 tour (as a three piece) and a show from the 1992 Gods of Grind tour. Sound on the two live shows is poor, particularly the latter, which Walker has described as "unmixed".

Owen, Walker, and Regadas continued with the band [[Blackstar (band)|Blackstar]], accompanied by former [[Cathedral (band)|Cathedral]] bassist Mark Griffiths, using the second ''Swansong'' advance from Earache to fund the recording. Blackstar, later Blackstar Rising, became defunct after drummer Owen suffered a severe [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. Amott went on to found [[hard rock]] band [[Spiritual Beggars]] and successful Swedish melodic death metal band [[Arch Enemy (band)|Arch Enemy]]. In the biggest musical departure, Steer formed [[Firebird (band)|Firebird]], a [[Eric Clapton|Clapton]]-esque rock band.

===Reformation (2007–2012)===
In June 2006, in an interview with Walker, he discussed the possibility of reforming Carcass, but mentioned that it was unlikely that Owen would participate, since he could not replicate his former drumming proficiency due to the effects of the cerebral hemorrhage he suffered in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lordsofmetal.nl/showinterview.php?id=1376&amp;lang=en|title=Archive|publisher=Lordsofmetal.nl|accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, Michael Amott announced that he was rehearsing with Bill Steer, Jeff Walker and [[Daniel Erlandsson]] (replacing Ken Owen) in secret to rehearse old Carcass songs for a possible reunion tour. The original plans were to play at several festivals during the summer, but they couldn't meet the deadlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/mike-amott-carcass-has-rehearsed-and-may-reunite-for-tour/|title=MIKE AMOTT: CARCASS Has Rehearsed And May Reunite For Tour|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=18 September 2007|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, Carcass were confirmed to play at German heavy metal festival [[Wacken Open Air]] and Finland's [[Tuska Open Air Metal Festival]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wacken.com/en/woa2010/main-news/news/archiv/archiv-single/article/sensation-carcass-is-back/|title=Sensation : CARCASS is back!!|website=Wacken.com|accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carcass later embarked on a reunion tour, beginning on 6 June 2008 at the Sweden Rock Festival in Norje, Sweden. Carcass also played at [[Hellfest Summer Open Air]], [[Metalcamp]] and several other festivals. The band toured Australia and New Zealand in 2008, and then in North America during September and October 2008, followed by the band's first South American tour, playing in Colombia, Chile, Argentina and Brazil. On 15 November 2008, Carcass headlined the Danish Metal Awards held in Amager Bio, Copenhagen, Denmark. Steer also presented the award for Best Danish Debut Album, which went to SCAMP for ''Mirror Faced Mentality''. Carcass surprised the audience by bringing Ken Owen to the stage where he gave a brief drum solo to show how far he had come in recovering from his illness. Carcass performed an exclusive UK show at the [[Damnation Festival]] in Leeds. It was the first time Carcass had played in England in 14 years.

Carcass re-released their entire back catalogue with bonus material during 2008 on [[Earache Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://askearache.blogspot.com/2008/03/carcass-5-dvd-documentaries-coming-up.html|title=ASK EARACHE: CARCASS- 5 DVD documentaries coming up soon|website=Askearache.blogspot.com|accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked if the band were planning on writing and recording a new album, Steer replied:

{{quote|I would be very surprised if that would really happen. But never say never, I'm always the last one who needs to be convinced. Michael and Jeff are much more busy with those things than I am.

Carcass continued to play live in 2009, with a North American tour completed in March 2009. Carcass also headlined the [[Bloodstock Open Air]] in Derbyshire, England in August 2009. In August 2010, Carcass headlined [[Vagos Open Air]] in [[Vagos Municipality|Vagos]], Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vagosopenair.eu/|title=Names Confirmed|publisher=Vagos Openair|accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jalometalli Metal Music Festival]] held in [[Oulu]], Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/suffocation-gorgoroth-dream-evil-confirmed-for-finland-s-jalometalli-festival/|title=SUFFOCATION, GORGOROTH, DREAM EVIL Confirmed For Finland's JALOMETALLI Festival|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=18 February 2010|accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Hellfest 2010, they performed the ''Necroticism'' album in its entirety.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} In 2012, Amott and Erlandsson left Carcass to focus on Arch Enemy.&lt;ref name="BMReactivated"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/reactivated-carcass-taps-trigger-the-bloodshed-drummer-for-comeback-album/ |title=Reactivated CARCASS Taps TRIGGER THE BLOODSHED Drummer For Comeback Album |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date= 12 December 2012 |accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Surgical Steel'' (2012–present)===
Steer and Walker started talking about recording a new album after the reunion shows were done. They wrote some songs to see how they would turn out. According to Steer, "If it sounded like Carcass to us, we were going to proceed. We also said if it didn't feel right, we'd just drop it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowar|first=Chad|title=Carcass Guitarist Bill Steer on Comeback Album Surgical Steel - "It's Not Really Cool If You're Influenced By Yourself"|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/211956|publisher=[[Brave Words &amp; Bloody Knuckles]]|accessdate=19 October 2013|date=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carcass recorded a new album in 2012, titled ''[[Surgical Steel (album)|Surgical Steel]]''.&lt;ref name="BMReactivated" /&gt; [[Daniel Wilding]] of [[Bristol]]-based [[deathgrind]] band [[Trigger the Bloodshed]] performs drums on ''Surgical Steel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decibelmagazine.com/featured/decibel-exclusive-jeff-walker-speaks-about-the-new-carcass-record|title=Decibel Exclusive: Jeff Walker Speaks About the New Carcass Record!}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original drummer, Ken Owen, was also brought in to record some backing vocals on the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thrash Hits TV: Carcass discuss having Ken Owen on backing vocals for Surgical Steel|url=http://www.thrashhits.com/2013/09/thrash-hits-tv-carcass-discuss-having-ken-owen-on-backing-vocals-for-surgical-steel/|publisher=Thrash Hits|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Ash of Pig Iron, Desolation, and Liquefied Skeleton joined the band in March 2013 on guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/new-carcass-lineup-performs-live-for-first-time-video-footage-available/ |title=New CARCASS Lineup Performs Live For First Time; Video Footage Available |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=27 March 2013 |accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a June 2014 interview with Metal Underground, Walker was asked if Carcass were going to make a follow-up to ''Surgical Steel''. He replied, "Ultimately, as long as we feel we got somewhere to go then we would create new material. We are not just going to do it just for the sake of it. We have to feel inspired. All I can say is I do see somewhere where we can take Carcass if we choose to do another album and personally I do want to do another album. I'm not completely satisfied with any album we've made so far. I don't think we've made the classic Carcass album, that's the way I feel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview With Carcass' Jeff Walker|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=103850|publisher=Metal Underground|date=22 June 2014|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carcass released an EP titled ''[[Surgical Remission/Surplus Steel]]'' in November 2014. The EP is a collection of unreleased tracks recorded during the ''Surgical Steel'' sessions and it is released on physical and digital formats. "Well, let's call this tying up loose ends," commented Carcass frontman Jeff Walker.

Carcass continued touring. They played at [[Download Festival]] in [[Castle Donington]] 13 June 2015.

On the ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]'' episode "Bella", the song "Captive Bolt Pistol" is played on a mixtape that supposedly also contains a computer virus.

In the ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' episode "[[Timeslides]]", Steer and Walker appeared as members of Lister's childhood band, ''Smeg and the Heads''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westword.com/music/carcass-bassist-jeff-walker-every-bass-player-is-just-a-failed-guitar-player-5684861|title=Carcass bassist Jeff Walker: "Every bass player is just a failed guitar player."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2087">'''Columbia Artists Management, Inc.''' ('''CAMI''') is an international talent management [[talent agent|agency]].

==History==
Based in [[New York City]], it was formed in 1930 as Columbia Concerts Corporation by [[Arthur Judson]] and [[William S. Paley]], the then head of the [[Columbia Broadcasting System]], who helped merge seven independent concert bureaus in the United States.

During its existence, CAMI has represented a very large number of active classical artists worldwide, including singers [[Leontyne Price]], [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]], [[Renata Tebaldi]], [[Mario Lanza]], [[Jussi Björling]], [[John McCormack (tenor)|John McCormack]], [[Richard Tucker]], [[Paul Robeson]], and [[George London (bass-baritone)|George London]]; pianists [[Vladimir Horowitz]], [[Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli]], and [[Van Cliburn]]; violinists [[Jascha Heifetz]], [[Yehudi Menuhin]], and [[Tossy Spivakovsky]]; and conductors [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Herbert von Karajan]], and [[Otto Klemperer]].

Composers [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Aaron Copland]] were managed by CAMI when they appeared as performers.

British music commentator [[Norman Lebrecht]] has criticized CAMI and Wilford for what Lebrecht deems to be overly pervasive influence of them on conductor salaries and limited time spent by music directors with orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2001/01/24/banorm24.xml Norman Lebrecht, "Could Silver Fox, the manager of maestros, be losing his grip?".

'''Criss-Cross''' was an artists' co-operative that was formed in Colorado, USA, in the early 1970s. Having evolved from the 1960s artists' community, [[Drop City]], Criss-Cross focused on issues surrounding "pattern and structure" and became associated with the 1970s art movement [[Pattern and Decoration]] (P&amp;D). 

In 1974, the five founders, [[Gene Bernofsky]], JoAnn Bernofsky, Richard Kallweit, Charles DiJulio and Clark Richert, artists and filmmakers from Drop City, regrouped in [[Boulder, Colorado]], to start the new artists' co-operative, Criss-Cross. Its purpose, like Drop City's, was to function in a "synergetic" interaction between peers to create experimental artistic innovation. Between 1974 and 1980, the number of participants grew to include the filmmaker [[Fred Worden]] (included in the [[2002 Whitney Biennial]]), the University of Arkansas painter/printmaker Marilyn Nelson, and the New York artists [[Gloria Klein]], [[George Woodman]] and others. 

Between 1974 and 1980, Criss-Cross published the nationally distributed [[Avant-garde|avant garde]] art periodical ''Criss-Cross Art Communications'' and curated national and international [[art exhibition]]s focused on "pattern and structure".

Criss-Cross constructed the first "61-Zone System" (in collaboration with [[Steve Baer]] of ZomeWorks of Albuquerque, [[New Mexico]]) at the [[Art Research Center]] in Kansas City.

In the practice of [[religion]], a '''cult image''' is a [[Cultural artifact|human-made object]] that is [[venerated]] or [[worshipped]] for the [[deity]], [[spirit]] or [[Daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]] that it embodies or represents. ''Cultus'', the outward rituals and religious formulas of "[[cult (religion)|cult]]" (meaning religious practice, as opposed to the pejorative term for a potentially dangerous "[[New religious movement|new religion]]"), often centers upon the treatment of cult images.  In several traditions, including the ancient religions of Egypt, Greece and Rome, and modern Hinduism, cult images in a temple may undergo a daily routine of being washed, dressed, and having food left for them.  Processions outside the temple on special [[feast day]]s are often a feature. [[Religious image]]s cover a wider range of all types of images made with a religious purpose, subject, or connection.  In many contexts "cult image" specifically means the most important image in a temple, kept in an inner space, as opposed to what may be many other images decorating the temple.  

The term '''idol''' is often synonymous with ''cult image'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=idol "Idol" in the American Heritage Dictionary (2016.)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idol "Idol" in Merriam–Webster (2017).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/idol "Idol" in the Oxford Living Dictionaries (2017).]&lt;/ref&gt; but may be used especially{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} of a cult image believed not just to depict or represent a deity or spirit, but in some sense to be one itself. Sometimes the image is believed to have its own powers, to grant wishes or otherwise affect the world. In cultures where idolatry is not viewed negatively, the word ''idol'' is not generally seen as pejorative, such as in [[Indian English]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibletexts.com/glossary/idolatry.htm "Idol", ''Harper’s Bible Dictionary'', ed. Paul J. Achtemier], San Francisco, Harper and Row, 1985; but readily used by, for example, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5VZtNRl24fsC&amp;pg=PA66 Swami Tejomayananada, in his ''Hindu culture, An Introduction''], p. 66, Chinmaya Mission, {{ISBN|8175971657}}, 9788175971653&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cult of images''' is the practice of worshipping or venerating religious or cult images representing divine figures.  Common in a number of ancient religions, the practice continues most prominently today in [[Hinduism]].  The [[Abrahamic religions]] all specifically ban idols and [[idolatry]]; all have had internal divisions and disputes as to what constitutes the proper or improper use of images in religion, and many Abrahamic religious denominations use or venerate images with varying attitudes towards them.

In general the belief that an image itself is the object of worship, and itself has or embodies a spirit with inherent powers, tends to be hard to verify when a religious context is examined closely, or to be held at a popular level but denied by the clergy of a religion.  Assertions by others outside the religious group concerned that such beliefs are held by the group are however common.

==Ancient Near East and Egypt==
The use of images in the [[Ancient Near East]] seems typically to have been similar to that of the [[ancient Egyptian religion]], about which we are the best-informed. Temples housed a cult image, and there were large numbers of other images.  The [[Origins of Judaism|ancient Hebrew religion]] was or became an exception, rejecting cult images despite developing [[monotheism]]; the connection between this and the [[Atenism]] that [[Akhenaten]] tried to impose on Egypt has been much discussed. In the [[art of Amarna]] [[Aten]] is represented only as the sun-disk, with rays emanating from it, sometimes ending in hands.

Cult images were a common presence in ancient Egypt, and still are in modern-day [[Kemetism]].  The term is often confined to the relatively small images, typically in gold, that lived in the ''[[Shrine|naos]]'' in the inner sanctuary of [[Egyptian temple]]s dedicated to that god (except when taken on ceremonial outings, say to visit their spouse).  These images usually showed the god in their sacred [[barque]] or boat; none of them survive.  Only the priests were allowed access to the inner sanctuary.

There was also a huge range of smaller images, many kept in the homes of ordinary people.  The very large stone images around the exteriors of temples were usually representations of the [[pharaoh]] as himself or "as" a deity, and many other images gave deities the features of the current royal family.

==Classical Greece and Rome==
All [[ancient Greek temple]]s and [[Roman temple]]s normally contained a cult image in the [[cella]].  Access to the cella varied, but apart from the priests, at the least some of the general worshippers could access the cella some of the time, though sacrifices to the deity were normally made on altars outside in the temple precinct ([[tenemos]] in Greek).  Some cult images were easy to see, and were what we would call major tourist attractions.  The image normally took the form of a statue of the deity, typically roughly life-size, but in some cases many times life-size, in marble or bronze, or in the specially prestigious form of a [[Chryselephantine sculpture|Chryselephantine statue]] using ivory plaques for the visible parts of the body and gold for the clothes, around a wooden framework.  The most famous Greek cult imges were of this type, including the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]], and [[Phidias]]'s [[Athena Parthenos]] in the [[Parthenon]] in Athens, both colossal statues now completely lost. Fragments of two chryselephantine stutues from [[Delphi]] have been excavated.  

The [[acrolith]] was another composite form, this time a cost-saving one with a wooden body.  A [[xoanon]] was a primitive and symbolic wooden image, perhaps comparable to the Hindu [[lingam]]; many of these were retained and revered for their antiquity.  Many of the Greek statues well-known from Roman marble copies were originally temple cult images, which in some cases, such as the [[Apollo Barberini]], can be credibly identified.  A very few actual originals survive, for example the bronze [[Piraeus Athena]] (2.35 metres high, including a helmet).

In [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]], a "[[Palladium (mythology)|palladium]]" was an image of great antiquity on which the safety of a city was said to depend, especially the wooden one that [[Odysseus]] and [[Diomedes]] stole from the [[citadel]] of [[Troy]] and which was later taken to [[Rome]] by [[Aeneas]]. (The Roman story was related in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' and other works.)

==Hinduism==
[[File:Dagdushet Halwai Ganpati 2005.jpg|thumb|A clay [[Ganesha]] murti, worshipped during [[Ganesh Chaturthi]] festival, and then ritually destroyed.]]
{{Main|Murti}}
The [[garbhagriha]] or inner shrine of a [[Hindu temple]] contains a cult image of the deity.  This may take the form of an elaborate statue, but a symbolic [[lingam]] is also very common, and sometimes a [[yoni]] or other symbolic form.  Normally only the priests are allowed to enter the chamber, but [[Hindu temple architecture]] typically allows the image to be seen by worshippers in the [[mandapa]] connected to it (entry to this, and the whole temple, may also be restricted in various ways).

In [[Hinduism]], a ''murti''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=pratima (Hinduism)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/398379/pratima|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically refers to an image that expresses a Divine Spirit (''murta''). Meaning literally "embodiment", a murti is a representation of a divinity, made usually of stone, wood, or metal, which serves as a means through which a divinity may be worshiped.&lt;ref name=kkk&gt;[[Klaus Klostermaier|Klostermaier, Klaus K.]] ''A Survey of Hinduism''. 1989 pp. 293–5&lt;/ref&gt; Hindus consider a murti worthy of serving as a focus of divine worship only after the divine is invoked in it for the purpose of offering worship.&lt;ref&gt;Kumar Singh, Nagendra. ''Encyclopaedia of Hinduism, Volume 7''. 1997, pp. 739–43&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction of the divinity must reflect the gestures and proportions outlined in religious tradition.

==Opposition from Abrahamic religions==
{{main|aniconism|iconoclasm}}
Members of [[Abrahamic religions]] identify cult images as "idols" and their worship as "[[idolatry]]", the worship of hollow forms. The [[paradox]] inherent in the worship of cult images was given classic expression in the [[Book of Isaiah]]:
{{quote |Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.|{{bibleref |Isaiah|2.8}}, reflected in {{bibleref |Isaiah|17.8}}.}}

The avoidance of such a degrading paradox was expressed in the early Christian idea of miraculous [[icon]]s that were not made by human hands, ''[[Acheiropoieta|acheiropoietoi]]''. Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christians make an exception for the [[veneration]] of image of saints, which is not considered by them to be [[adoration]] or ''[[latria]]''. The word ''idol'' entered [[Middle English]] in the 13th century from Old French ''idole'' adapted in [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] from the Greek ''eidolon'' ("appearance" extended in later usage to "mental image, apparition, phantom").  Greek ''eidos'' was employed by [[Plato]] and the [[Platonists]] to signify perfect immutable "forms".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=i&amp;p=0 | title = Etymonline}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Mecca==
Towards the end of the [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic era]] in the Arabian city of [[Mecca]]; an era otherwise known, by the Muslims, as جاهلية, or [[Jahiliyyah|al-Jahiliyah]], the [[Paganism|pagan]] or pre-Islamic, merchants of Mecca controlled the sacred [[Kaaba]], thereby regulating control over it, and, in turn, over the city itself. The local tribes, of the [[Arabian peninsula]], came to this centre of commerce to place their idols in the Kaaba, in the process being charged [[tithes]]. Thus helping the Meccan merchants to incur substantial wealth, as well as insuring a fruitful atmosphere for trade and intertribal relations in relative peace.

The number and nature of deities in the pre-Islamic mythology are parallel to that of other polytheistic cultures. Some have been [[Arabian mythology|official Gods]] others of a more private character.

Muhammad's preaching incurred the wrath of the pagan merchants, causing them to plot against him. The opposition to his teachings grew so volatile that Muhammad and his followers were forced to [[Hijra (Islam)|flee Mecca]] to [[Medina]] for protection; leading to armed conflict and triggering many battles that were won and lost, which finally culminated in the [[conquest of Mecca]] in the year 630. In the aftermath, Muhammad did three things. Firstly, with his companions he visited the Kaaba and literally threw out the idols and destroyed them, thus removing the signs of [[Jahiliyyah]] from the Kaaba. Secondly, he ordered the construction of a [[mosque]] around the Kaaba, the first [[Masjid al-Haram]] after the birth of [[Islam]]. Thirdly, in a magnanimous manner, Muhammad pardoned all those who had taken up arms against him. With the destruction of the idols and the construction of the Masjid al-Haram, a new era was ushered in; facilitating [[Spread of Islam|the rise of Islam]].

==Christianity==
{{main|Religious images in Christian theology|Byzantine iconoclasm|Protestant Reformation and art}}
[[File:Frans Hogenberg Bildersturm 1566.jpg|thumb|right|Frans Hogenberg, ''The Calvinist Iconoclastic Riot of August 20, 1566'', in [[Antwerp]], the key moment of the [[Beeldenstorm]] in 1566, when paintings and church decorations and fittings were destroyed in several weeks of a violent iconoclastic outbreak in the [[Low Countries]]. Several similar episodes occurred during the early [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] period.]]
Christian images that are venerated are called [[icon]]s. Christians who venerate icons make an emphatic distinction between "[[veneration]]" and "[[worship]]".

The introduction of venerable images in Christianity was highly controversial for centuries, and in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] the controversy lingered until it re-erupted in the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] of the 8th and 9th centuries. Religious [[monumental sculpture]] remained foreign to Orthodoxy.  In the West, resistance to idolatry delayed the introduction of sculpted images for centuries until the time of [[Charlemagne]], whose placing of a life-size [[crucifix]] in the [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen]] was probably a decisive moment, leading to the widespread use of monumental [[relief]]s on churches, and later large statues. 

The ''[[Libri Carolini]]'', a somewhat mis-fired Carolingian counter-blast against imagined Orthodox positions, set out what remains the Catholic position on the veneration of images, giving them a similar but slightly less significant place than in Eastern Orthodoxy. 

The intensified [[pathos]] that informs the poem ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' takes corporeal form in the realism and sympathy-inducing sense of pain in the typical Western European corpus (the representation of Jesus' crucified body) from the mid-13th century onwards. "The theme of Christ's suffering on the cross was so important in Gothic art that the mid-thirteenth-century statute of the corporations of Paris provided for a guild dedicated to the carving of such images, including ones in ivory".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/07/euwf/hod_1978.521.3.htm | title = Metmuseum}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th-century [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] engendered spates of venerable image smashing, especially in England, Scotland, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, the [[Low Countries]] (the [[Beeldenstorm]]) and France.  Destruction of three-dimensional images was normally near-total, especially images of the [[Virgin Mary]] and saints, and the [[Iconoclasm|iconoclast]]s ("image-breakers") also smashed representations of holy figures in [[stained glass]] windows and other imagery.  Further destruction of cult images, anathema to [[Puritans]], occurred during the [[English Civil War]]. Less extreme transitions occurred throughout northern Europe in which formerly Catholic churches became Protestant.  In these, the ''corpus'' (body of Christ) was removed from the crucifix leaving a bare cross and walls were  whitewashed of religious images.

Catholic regions of Europe, especially artistic centres like [[Rome]] and [[Antwerp]], responded to Reformation iconoclasm with a [[Counter-Reformation]] renewal of venerable imagery, though banning some of the more fanciful medieval iconographies.  Veneration of the Virgin Mary flourished, in practice and in imagery, and new shrines, such as in Rome's [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Santa Maria Maggiore]], were built for [[Medieval]] miraculous [[icon]]s as part of this trend.

==Jainism==
[[File:Liberated.jpeg|thumb|Left|150px|Image of ''Siddha'' (Liberated soul) worshiped by the Jains]]
{{See also|Jain sculpture}}
In [[Jainism]], the [[Tirthankara]]s (Teaching Gods) represent the true goal of all human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Zimmer |first1=Heinrich |title=Philosophies Of India |year=1953 |editor=Joseph Campbell |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd |location=London, E.C. 4 |url=https://archive.org/details/Philosophy.of.India.by.Heinrich.Zimmer |isbn=978-8120807396|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their qualities are worshipped by the Jains. Images depicting any of the twenty four ''[[Tirthankara]]s'' are placed in the [[Jain temple]]s. There is no belief that the image itself is other than a representation of the being it represents. The Tirthankaras cannot respond to such veneration, but that it can function as a meditative aid. Although most veneration takes the form of prayers, hymns and recitations, the idol is sometimes ritually bathed, and often has offerings of made to it; there are eight kinds of offering representing the eight types of [[Karma in Jainism|karmas]] as per Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.jaina.org/educationcommittee/education_material/C15_Jain_Rituals_and_Holidays/Jain%20Rituals%20and%20Ceremonies%20-%20%20Hansa%20Sutaria.doc | format = Doc | publisher = Jaina | title = Jain rituals &amp; ceremonies | contribution = Hansa sutaria | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070628175007/http://www.jaina.org/educationcommittee/education_material/C15_Jain_Rituals_and_Holidays/Jain%20Rituals%20and%20Ceremonies%20-%20%20Hansa%20Sutaria.doc | archivedate = 2007-06-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of reverence is not a central tenet of the faith..

==Shinto==
In [[Shinto]], cult images are called [[shintai]]. The earliest historical examples of these were natural objects such as stones, waterfalls, trees or mountains, like [[Mount Fuji]], while the vast majority are man-made objects such as swords, jewels or mirrors. Rather than being representative of or part of the [[kami]], shintai are seen as repositories in which the essence of such spirits can temporarily reside to make themselves accessible for humans to worship. A ceremony called [[kanjō]] can be used to propagate the essence of a kami into another shintai, allowing the same deity to be enshrined in multiple shrines.

In [[cinematography]], the '''dolly grip''' is a dedicated technician trained to operate the [[camera dolly]]. This technician places, levels, and moves the dolly track, then pushes and pulls the dolly and usually a [[camera operator]] and [[camera assistant]] as riders. If the dolly has a moveable vertical axis, such as a hydraulic arm, then the dolly grip also operates the "boom". If both axes are used simultaneously, this type of [[tracking shot|dolly shot]] is known as a compound move.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmproductionroles11med23.wikispaces.com/Grip filmproductionroles.com Grip]&lt;/ref&gt;

A dolly grip must work closely with the camera crew to perfect these complex movements ([[cinematic techniques]]) during rehearsals. Focusing the lens is critical to capturing a sharp image, so a dolly grip must hit his or her marks in concert with a camera assistant who pulls focus. It is a skill that experience can hone to a point, but the best dolly grips are known for their "touch," and that makes them highly sought-after.

A dolly grip is also employed when the camera is operated in handheld mode (on the operator's shoulders or literally in their hands). While the camera operator is moving with the camera, the dolly grip is responsible for the operator's safety, helping the operator to "blindly" negotiate sometimes complicated environments. The dolly grip silently directs the operator (through gentle touches, nudges, pulls and pushes) away from walls and other obstacles that the operator cannot see while concentrating on the image in the camera viewfinder. The same is true when the camera is operated with a [[Steadicam]] or similar body-mounted stabilization tool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dollygrippery.net/ dollygrippery.net Dollygrippery, The definitive site on camera movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although dolly grips are hired by and under a [[key grip]], they are paid the same as (or more than) a [[best boy|best boy grip]], who is the second-in-command.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dollygrippery.net/2010/01/dolly-grip-job-description.html dollygrippery.net Dollygrippery, Dolly Grip Job Description, January 03, 2010 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolly grips may also push a wheeled platform holding the microphone and boom operator.

Crane operators in the film industry are specially trained film crew. They are normally [[Grip (job)|grips]].

Some [[Shot (filmmaking)|shot]]s require the [[camera]] to move. This can be done several ways, one of which is to use a [[camera crane]]. There are many types of camera cranes, most being a [[counterbalance]]d arm on a pivot, whilst others are hydraulic. Cranes can be used to lift the camera, and often the camera operator and assistant also, quickly into the air. The crane operator sets up and operates the camera crane so that the camera arrives at the right spot. This can be difficult since the camera may be a long distance from the operator.

A '''dome''' (from [[Latin]]: ''domus'') is an architectural element that resembles the hollow upper half of a [[sphere]]. The precise definition has been a matter of controversy. There are also a wide variety of forms and specialized terms to describe them. A dome can rest upon a [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] or [[Tholobate|drum]], and can be supported by [[column]]s or [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] that transition to the dome through [[squinch]]es or [[pendentive]]s. A [[Roof lantern|lantern]] may cover an [[oculus]] and may itself have [[Cupola|another dome]].

Domes have a long architectural lineage that extends back into [[prehistory]] and they have been constructed from mud, snow, stone, wood, brick, concrete, metal, glass, and plastic over the centuries. The symbolism associated with domes includes [[Funerary art|mortuary]], [[Celestial sphere|celestial]], and governmental traditions that have likewise developed over time.

Domes have been found from early [[Mesopotamia]], which may explain the form's spread. They are found in Persian, [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]], Roman, and Chinese architecture in the [[Ancient history|Ancient world]], as well as among a number of contemporary [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] building traditions. Dome structures were popular in [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and medieval [[Islamic architecture]], and there are numerous examples from Western Europe in the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] architectural style spread from Italy in the [[Early modern period]]. Advancements in mathematics, materials, and production techniques since that time resulted in new dome types. The domes of the modern world can be found over religious buildings, legislative chambers, sports stadiums, and a variety of functional structures.

== Etymology ==
The English word "dome" ultimately derives from the Latin ''domus'' ("house") from ancient Greek δόμος (dómos), which, up through the Renaissance, labeled a revered house, such as a ''Domus Dei'', or "House of God", regardless of the shape of its roof. This is reflected in the uses of the Italian word ''duomo'', the German/Icelandic/Danish word ''dom'' ("cathedral"), and the English word ''dome'' as late as 1656, when it meant a "Town-House, Guild-Hall, State-House, and Meeting-House in a city." The French word ''dosme'' came to acquire the meaning of a [[cupola]] vault, specifically, by 1660. This French definition gradually became the standard usage of the English ''dome'' in the eighteenth century as many of the most impressive Houses of God were built with monumental domes, and in response to the scientific need for more technical terms.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=5}}

== Terminology ==
[[File:Arc truefalserp.jpg|thumb|right|Comparison of a generic "true" arch (left) and a corbel arch (right)]]
A dome is a rounded vault made of either curved segments or a [[Surface of revolution|shell of revolution]], meaning an [[arch]] rotated around its central vertical axis.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=301}} The terminology used has been a source of controversy, with inconsistency between scholars and even within individual texts, but the term "dome" may be considered a "blanket-word to describe an hemispherical or similar spanning element."{{sfn|Dodge|1984|p=265-266}} A half-dome or [[semi-dome]] is a semi-circular shape often used, especially in [[apse]]s.

Sometimes called "false" domes, [[Corbel arch|corbel]] domes achieve their shape by extending each horizontal layer of stones inward slightly farther than the lower one until they meet at the top.{{sfn|Huerta|2007|p=212}} A "false" dome may also refer to a wooden dome.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=302}} "True" domes are said to be those whose structure is in a state of compression, with constituent elements of wedge-shaped [[voussoir]]s, the joints of which align with a central point. The validity of this is unclear, as domes built underground with corbelled stone layers are also in compression from the surrounding earth.{{sfn|Wright|2009|p=179-180, 188}} The Italian use of the term ''finto'', meaning "false", can be traced back to the 17th century in the use of vaulting made of reed mats and gypsum mortar.{{sfn|Nobile|Bares|2015|p=4}}

As with arches, the "springing" of a dome is the level from which the dome rises. The top of a dome is the "crown". The inner side of a dome is called the "intrados" and the outer side is called the "extrados".{{sfn|Dumser|2010|p=436}} The "haunch" is the part of an arch that lies roughly halfway between the base and the top.{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=203}}

The word "[[cupola]]" is another word for "dome", and is usually used for a small dome upon a roof or [[turret]].{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=114}} "Cupola" has also been used to describe the inner side of a dome.{{sfn|Technical|1872|p=252}}

Drums, also called [[tholobate]]s, are cylindrical or polygonal walls with or without windows that support a dome. A [[tambour]] or [[Roof lantern|lantern]] is the equivalent structure over a dome's oculus, supporting a [[cupola]].{{sfn|Ching|2011|p=63}}

== Characteristics ==

=== Internal forces ===
A masonry dome produces [[thrust]]s down and outward. They are thought of in terms of two kinds of forces at right angles from one another. Meridional forces (like the [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]], or lines of longitude, on a globe) are [[Compression (physics)|compressive]] only, and increase towards the base, while hoop forces (like the lines of [[latitude]] on a globe) are in compression at the top and [[Tension (physics)|tension]] at the base, with the transition in a hemispherical dome occurring at an angle of 51.8 degrees from the top.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=242}} The thrusts generated by a dome are directly proportional to the weight of its materials.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=301}} Grounded hemispherical domes generate significant horizontal thrusts at their haunches.{{sfn|Robison|1991|p=395}}

Unlike voussoir arches, which require support for each element until the [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]] is in place, domes are stable during construction as each level is made a complete and self-supporting ring.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=302}} The upper portion of a masonry dome is always in compression and is supported laterally, so it does not collapse except as a whole unit and a range of deviations from the ideal in this shallow upper cap are equally stable.{{sfn|Gye|1988|p=141-142}} Because voussoir domes have lateral support, they can be made much thinner than corresponding arches of the same span. For example, a hemispherical dome can be 2.5 times thinner than a semicircular arch, and a dome with the profile of an [[Gothic architecture#Equilateral arch|equilateral arch]] can be thinner still.{{sfn|Fernández|Hernández-Ros|1989}}

The optimal shape for a masonry dome of equal thickness provides for perfect compression, with none of the tension or bending forces against which masonry is weak.{{sfn|Robison|1991|p=395}} For a particular material, the optimal dome geometry is called the funicular surface, the comparable shape in three dimensions to a [[catenary]] curve for a two-dimensional arch.{{sfn|Rovero|Tonietti|2012|p=183}}{{sfn|Blockley|2014|p=22}} The pointed profiles of many Gothic domes more closely approximate this optimal shape than do hemispheres, which were favored by Roman and Byzantine architects due to the circle being considered the most perfect of forms. Adding a weight to the top of the pointed dome, such as the heavy cupola at the top of [[Florence Cathedral]], changes the optimal shape to perfectly match the actual pointed shape of the dome.{{sfn|Larson|Tyas|2003|p=32, 38}}

The outward thrusts in the lower portion of a hemispherical masonry dome can be counteracted with the use of chains incorporated around the circumference or with external buttressing, although cracking along the meridians is natural.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=242}} For small or tall domes with less horizontal thrust, the thickness of the supporting arches or walls can be enough to resist deformation, which is why drums tend to be much thicker than the domes they support.{{sfn|Gye|1988|p=142}}

=== Zone of transition ===
[[File:Pendentive and Dome.png|thumb|right|A compound dome (red) with pendentives (yellow) from a sphere of greater radius than the dome.]]
[[File:مسجد_سالن_اجلاس_بین_المللی_اصفهان.jpg|thumb|An example of quadrangular to circle transition – The mosque of [[Isfahan]] international conference center]]
When the base of the dome does not match the plan of the supporting walls beneath it (for example, a dome's circular base over a square [[Bay (architecture)|bay]]), techniques are employed to bridge the two.{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=127}} One technique is to use corbelling, progressively projecting horizontal layers from the top of the supporting wall to the base of the dome, such as the corbelled triangles often used in Seljuk and Ottoman architecture.{{sfn|Arun|2006|pp=304-305}} The simplest technique is to use diagonal [[Lintel (architecture)|lintels]] across the corners of the walls to create an [[octagon]]al base. Another is to use arches to span the corners, which can support more weight.{{sfn|Nuttgens|1997|p=123}} A variety of these techniques use what are called "[[squinch]]es".{{sfn|Ward|1915|p=2}} A squinch can be a single arch or a set of multiple projecting nested arches placed diagonally over an internal corner.{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=127, 419}} Squinches can take a variety of other forms, as well, including trumpet arches and [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] heads, or half-domes.{{sfn|Ward|1915|p=2}}

The invention of [[pendentives]] superseded the squinch technique.{{sfn|Nuttgens|1997|p=123}} Pendentives are triangular sections of a sphere, like concave [[spandrel]]s between arches, and transition from the corners of a square bay to the circular base of a dome. The curvature of the pendentives is that of a sphere with a diameter equal to the diagonal of the square bay.{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=127, 329}} The precise definition of "pendentive" has been a source of contention among academics, including whether or not corbelling is permitted under the definition and whether or not the lower portions of a sail vault should be considered pendentives.{{sfn|Dodge|1984|p=271-276, 279}}

Domes with pendentives can be divided into two kinds: ''simple'' and ''compound''.{{sfn|Catholic}} In the case of the ''simple dome'', the pendentives are part of the same sphere as the dome itself; however, such domes are rare.{{sfn|Fletcher|p=}} In the case of the more common ''compound dome'', the pendentives are part of the surface of a larger sphere below that of the dome itself and form a circular base for either the dome or a drum section.{{sfn|Catholic}}

=== Acoustics ===
Because domes are concave from below, they can reflect sound and create echoes.{{sfn|Kayili|p=9}} A dome may have a "[[whispering gallery]]" at its base that at certain places transmits distinct sound to other distant places in the gallery.{{sfn|Ching|2011|p=63}} The half-domes over the apses of Byzantine churches helped to project the [[chant]]s of the clergy.{{sfn|Ousterhout|2008a|p=13}} Although this can complement music, it may make speech less intelligible, leading [[Francesco Giorgi]] in 1535 to recommend vaulted ceilings for the choir areas of a church, but a flat ceiling filled with as many coffers as possible for where preaching would occur.{{sfn|Baumann|Haggh|1990|p=208-209}}

Cavities in the form of jars built into the inner surface of a dome may serve to compensate for this interference by diffusing sound in all directions, eliminating echoes while creating a "divine effect in the atmosphere of worship." This technique was written about by [[Vitruvius]] in his [[De architectura|''Ten Books on Architecture'']], which describes bronze and earthenware resonators.{{sfn|Kayili|p=9}} The material, shape, contents, and placement of these [[Resonator|cavity resonators]] determine the effect they have: reinforcing certain frequencies or absorbing them.{{sfn|Baumann|Haggh|1990|p=202}}

=== Materials ===
The earliest domes in the Middle East were built with mud-brick and, eventually, with baked brick and stone. Domes of wood allowed for wide spans due to the relatively light and flexible nature of the material and were the normal method for domed churches by the 7th century, although most domes were built with the other less flexible materials. Wooden domes were protected from the weather by roofing, such as copper or lead sheeting.{{sfn|Peterson|1996|p=68}} Domes of cut stone were more expensive and never as large, and timber was used for large spans where brick was unavailable.{{sfn|Mainstone|2001|p=121}}

Roman concrete used an aggregate of stone with a powerful mortar. The aggregate transitioned over the centuries to pieces of fired clay, then to Roman bricks. By the sixth century, bricks with large amounts of mortar were the principle vaulting materials. [[Pozzolana]] appears to have only been used in central Italy.{{sfn|MacDonald|1958|p=2-3, 7}} Brick domes were the favored choice for large-space monumental coverings until the [[Industrial Age]], due to their convenience and dependability.{{sfn|Kuban|1987|p=73}} [[Tie (engineering)|Ties]] and chains of iron or wood could be used to resist stresses.{{sfn|Giustina|2003|p=1037}}

The new building materials of the 19th century and a better understanding of the forces within structures from the 20th century has opened up new possibilities. Iron and steel beams, steel cables, and pre-stressed concrete have eliminated the need for external buttressing and enabled far thinner domes. Whereas earlier masonry domes may have had a radius to thickness ratio of 50, the ratio for modern domes can be in excess of 800. The lighter weight of these domes has not only permitted far greater spans, but also allowed for the creation of large movable domes over modern sports stadiums.{{sfn|Denny|2010|p=139}}

Experimental rammed earth domes were made as part of work on [[sustainable architecture]] at the [[University of Kassel]] in 1983.{{sfn|Minke|2012|p=57-59, 127}}

=== Symbolism ===
{{Main|Symbolism of domes}}
According to E. Baldwin Smith, from the [[Later Stone Age|late Stone Age]] the dome-shaped tomb was used as a reproduction of the ancestral, god-given shelter made permanent as a venerated home of the dead. The instinctive desire to do this resulted in widespread domical mortuary traditions across the ancient world, from the [[stupa]]s of [[India]] to the [[Beehive tomb|tholos tombs]] of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]. By Hellenistic and Roman times, the domical tholos had become the customary cemetery symbol.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=51-53}}

Domes and tent-canopies were also associated with the heavens in Ancient Persia and the Hellenistic-Roman world. A dome over a square base reflected the geometric symbolism of those shapes. The circle represented perfection, eternity, and the heavens. The square represented the earth. An octagon was intermediate between the two.{{sfn|Grupico|2011|p=3, 8}} The distinct symbolism of the heavenly or cosmic tent stemming from the royal audience tents of [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] and Indian rulers was adopted by Roman rulers in imitation of [[Alexander the Great]], becoming the imperial [[baldachin]]. This probably began with [[Nero]], whose "[[Domus Aurea|Golden House]]" also made the dome an essential feature of palace architecture.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=53}}

The dual sepulchral and heavenly symbolism was adopted by [[Early Christianity|early Christians]] in both the use of domes in architecture and in the [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]], a domical canopy like the baldachin used as a ritual covering for relics or the [[Altar#Christianity|church altar]]. The celestial symbolism of the dome, however, was the preeminent one by the [[Christian era]].{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=53-56, 79}} In the early centuries of Islam, domes were closely associated with royalty. A dome built in front of the mihrab of a mosque, for example, was at least initially meant to emphasize the place of a prince during royal ceremonies. Over time such domes became primarily focal points for decoration or the direction of prayer. The use of domes in mausoleums can likewise reflect royal patronage or be seen as representing the honor and prestige that domes symbolized, rather than having any specific funerary meaning.{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=195, 197}} The wide variety of dome forms in medieval Islam reflected dynastic, religious, and social differences as much as practical building considerations.{{sfn|Peterson|1996|p=68}}

== General types ==

=== Beehive dome ===
{{see also|Beehive tomb}}

Also called a ''corbelled dome'',{{sfn|Höcker|2000|p=181, 183}} or ''false dome'',{{sfn|Dror|2011|p=163}} these are different from a 'true dome' in that they consist of purely horizontal layers. As the layers get higher, each is slightly [[cantilever]]ed, or [[corbel]]ed, toward the center until meeting at the top. A monumental example is the Mycenaean [[Treasury of Atreus]] from the late [[Bronze Age]].{{sfn|Wright|2009|p=188}}

=== Braced dome ===

A single or double layer [[space frame]] in the form of a dome,{{sfn|Makowski|1962|p=62}} a ''braced dome'' is a generic term that includes ''ribbed'',{{sfn|Chen|Lui|2005|p=24-18}} ''[[Johann Wilhelm Schwedler#Schwedler cupola|Schwedler]]'',{{sfn|Chen|Lui|2005|p=24-18}}  ''three-way grid'',{{sfn|Chen|Lui|2005|p=24-18}}  ''lamella'' or ''Kiewitt'',{{sfn|Chen|Lui|2005|p=24-18, 24-19}}  ''lattice'',{{sfn|Ramaswamy|Eekhout|2002|p=141}} and ''[[Geodesic dome|geodesic]] domes''.{{sfn|Chen|Lui|2005|p=24-2, 24-18}} The different terms reflect different arrangements in the surface members. Braced domes often have a very low weight and are usually used to cover spans of up to 150 meters.{{sfn|Saka|2007|p=595}} Often prefabricated, their component members can either lie on the dome's surface of revolution, or be straight lengths with the connecting points or nodes lying upon the surface of revolution. Single-layer structures are called ''frame'' or ''skeleton'' types and double-layer structures are ''truss'' types, which are used for large spans. When the covering also forms part of the structural system, it is called a ''stressed skin'' type. The ''formed surface'' type consists of sheets joined together at bent edges to form the structure.{{sfn|Makowski|1962|p=62}}

=== Cloister vault ===
{{Main|Cloister vault}}

Called ''domical vaults'' (a term sometimes also applied to sail vaults)&lt;!-- this is an inconsistency in the sources, which is acknowledged by Dodge, 1984, page 273--&gt;,{{sfn|Moffett|Fazio|Wodehouse|2003|p=}}{{sfn|Dodge|1984|p=273}} ''polygonal domes'',{{sfn|Newman|Pevnser|1972|p=527}} ''coved domes'',{{sfn|Dien|2007|p=80}} ''gored domes'',{{sfn|Ward|1915|p=9}} ''segmental domes''{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=303}} (a term sometimes also used for saucer domes), ''paneled vaults'',{{sfn|Dodge|1984|p=268}} or ''pavilion vaults'',{{sfn|Sear|1983|p=79}} these are domes that maintain a polygonal shape in their horizontal cross section. The earliest known examples date to the first century BC, such as the [[Tabularium]] of Rome from 78 BC. Others include the Baths of Antoninus in [[Carthage]] (145–160) and the [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen|Palatine Chapel at Aachen]] (13th – 14th century).{{sfn|Como|2013|p=320}} The most famous example is the Renaissance octagonal dome of Filippo Brunelleschi over the Florence Cathedral. [[Thomas Jefferson]], the third president of the United States, installed an octagonal dome above the West front of his plantation house, [[Monticello]].{{sfn|Kern}}

=== Compound dome ===

Also called ''domes on pendentives''{{sfn|Karydis|2012|p=362-363}} or ''pendentive domes''{{sfn|Hassan|Mazloomi|2010|p=105}} (a term also applied to sail vaults), compound domes have pendentives that support a smaller diameter dome immediately above them, as in the Hagia Sophia, or a drum and dome, as in many Renaissance and post-Renaissance domes, with both forms resulting in greater height.{{sfn|Catholic}}

=== Crossed-arch dome ===

One of the earliest types of ribbed vault, the first known examples are found in the [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba|Great Mosque of Córdoba]] in the 10th century. Rather than meeting in the center of the dome, the ribs characteristically intersect one another off-center, forming an empty polygonal space in the center. Geometry is a key element of the designs, with the octagon being perhaps the most popular shape used. Whether the arches are structural or purely decorative remains a matter of debate. The type may have an eastern origin, although the issue is also unsettled. Examples are found in Spain, North Africa, Armenia, Iran, France, and Italy.{{sfn|Fuentes|Huerta|2010|p=346-352}}

=== Ellipsoidal dome ===

The ''[[Ellipsoid|ellipsoidal]] dome'' is a surface formed by the rotation around a vertical axis of a [[Ellipse|semi-ellipse]]. Like other "rotational domes" formed by the rotation of a curve around a vertical axis, ellipsoidal domes have circular bases and horizontal sections and are a type of "circular dome" for that reason.{{sfn|Arun|2006|p=304}}

=== Geodesic dome ===

{{Main|Geodesic dome}}
''Geodesic domes'' are the upper portion of geodesic spheres. They are composed of a framework of triangles in a [[polyhedron]] pattern.{{sfn|Langmead|Garnaut|2001|p=131}} The structures are named for [[geodesic]]s and are based upon geometric shapes such as [[icosahedron]]s, [[octahedron]]s or [[tetrahedron]]s.{{sfn|Langmead|Garnaut|2001|p=131}}{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=302}} Such domes can be created using a limited number of simple elements and joints and efficiently resolve a dome's internal forces. Their efficiency is said to increase with size.{{sfn|Ambrose|Tripeny|2011|p=36}} Although not first invented by [[Buckminster Fuller]], they are associated with him because he designed many geodesic domes and patented them in the United States.{{sfn|Denny|2010|p=140}}

=== Hemispherical dome ===

The ''hemispherical dome'' is a surface formed by the rotation around a vertical axis of a [[semicircle]]. Like other "rotational domes" formed by the rotation of a curve around a vertical axis, hemispherical domes have circular bases and horizontal sections and are a type of "circular dome" for that reason. They experience vertical compression along their meridians, but horizontally experience compression only in the portion above 51.8 degrees from the top. Below this point, hemispherical domes experience tension horizontally, and usually require buttressing to counteract it.{{sfn|Arun|2006|p=304}} According to E. Baldwin Smith, it was a shape likely known to the Assyrians, defined by Greek theoretical mathematicians, and standardized by Roman builders.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=8, 9}}

''Bulbous domes'' bulge out beyond their base diameters, offering a profile greater than a hemisphere.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=302}} An ''onion dome'' is a greater than hemispherical dome with a pointed top in an [[ogee]] profile.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=302}} They are found in the [[Near East]], [[Middle East]], Persia, and India and may not have had a single point of origin. Their appearance in northern Russian architecture predates the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'#The age of Tatar rule|Tatar occupation of Russia]] and so is not easily explained as the result of that influence.{{sfn|Hamilton|1983|p=42}} They became popular in the second half of the 15th century in the [[Low Countries]] of Northern Europe, possibly inspired by the finials of [[minaret]]s in Egypt and Syria, and developed in the 16th and 17th centuries in the Netherlands before spreading to Germany, becoming a popular element of the baroque architecture of Central Europe. German bulbous domes were also influenced by Russian and Eastern European domes.{{sfn|Born|1944|p=220-221}} The examples found in various European architectural styles are typically wooden.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=302}} Examples include Kazan Church in [[Kolomenskoye]] and the [[Royal Pavilion|Brighton Pavilion]] by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]].{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=302}} In Islamic architecture, they are typically made of masonry, rather than timber, with the thick and heavy bulging portion serving to buttress against the tendency of masonry domes to spread at their bases. The Taj Mahal is a famous example.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=302}}

=== Oval dome ===

An ''oval dome'' is a dome of [[oval]] shape in plan, profile, or both. The term comes from the Latin ''ovum'', meaning "egg". The earliest oval domes were used by convenience in corbelled stone huts as rounded but geometrically undefined coverings, and the first examples in Asia Minor date to around 4000 B.C. The geometry was eventually defined using combinations of circular arcs, transitioning at points of tangency. If the Romans created oval domes, it was only in exceptional circumstances. The Roman foundations of the oval plan [[St. Gereon's Basilica, Cologne|Church of St. Gereon in Cologne]] point to a possible example. Domes in the Middle Ages also tended to be circular, though the church of [[Santo Tomás de las Ollas]] in Spain has an oval dome over its oval plan. Other examples of medieval oval domes can be found covering rectangular bays in churches. Oval plan churches became a type in the [[Renaissance]] and popular in the [[Baroque]] style.{{sfn|Huerta|2007|p=231}} The dome built for the basilica of [[Vicoforte]] by Francesco Gallo was one of the largest and most complex ever made.{{sfn|Bagliani|2009}} Although the ellipse was known, in practice, domes of this shape were created by combining segments of circles. Popular in the 16th and 17th centuries, oval and elliptical plan domes can vary their dimensions in three axes or two axes. {{sfn|Escrig|Cobreros|Valcarcel|1997|pp=355-356}} A sub-type with the long axis having a semicircular section is called a Murcia dome, as in the Chapel of the Junterones at [[Murcia Cathedral]]. When the short axis has a semicircular section, it is called a Melon dome.{{sfn|Escrig|Cobreros|Valcarcel|1997|p=358}}

=== Paraboloid dome ===
A ''[[paraboloid]] dome'' is a surface formed by the rotation around a vertical axis of a sector of a parabola. Like other "rotational domes" formed by the rotation of a curve around a vertical axis, paraboloid domes have circular bases and horizontal sections and are a type of "circular dome" for that reason. Because of their shape, paraboloid domes experience only compression, both radially and horizontally.{{sfn|Arun|2006|p=304}}

=== Sail dome ===

Also called ''sail vaults'',{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=127, 463}} ''handkerchief vaults'',{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=462}} ''domical vaults'' (a term sometimes also applied to cloister vaults)&lt;!-- this is an inconsistency in the sources, which is acknowledged by Dodge, 1984, page 273--&gt;,{{sfn|Dodge|1984|p=273}} ''pendentive domes''{{sfn|Dodge|1984|p=274}} (a term that has also been applied to compound domes), ''Bohemian vaults'',{{sfn|Burckhardt|1987|p=58}} or ''Byzantine domes'', this type can be thought of as [[pendentives]] that, rather than merely touching each other to form a circular base for a drum or compound dome, smoothly continue their curvature to form the dome itself. The dome gives the impression of a square sail pinned down at each corner and billowing upward.{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=127}} These can also be thought of as saucer domes upon pendentives.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=303}} Sail domes are based upon the shape of a hemisphere and are not to be confused with elliptic parabolic vaults, which appear similar but have different characteristics.{{sfn|Arun|2006|p=304}}

=== Saucer dome ===

Also called ''segmental domes''{{sfn|Dodge|1984|p=263}} (a term sometimes also used for cloister vaults), or ''calottes'',{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=127}} these have profiles of [[Circular segment|less than half a circle]]. Because they reduce the portion of the dome in tension, these domes are strong but have increased radial thrust.{{sfn|Dodge|1984|p=263}} Many of the largest existing domes are of this shape.

Masonry saucer domes, because they exist entirely in compression, can be built much thinner than other dome shapes without becoming unstable. The trade-off between the proportionately increased horizontal thrust at their abutments and their decreased weight and quantity of materials may make them more economical, but they are more vulnerable to damage from movement in their supports.{{sfn|Gye|1988|p=142-143}}

=== Umbrella dome ===

Also called ''gadrooned'',{{sfn|Yaghan|2003|p=69}} ''fluted'',{{sfn|Yaghan|2003|p=69}} ''organ-piped'',{{sfn|Yaghan|2003|p=69}} ''pumpkin'',{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=127}} ''melon'',{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=127}} ''ribbed'',{{sfn|Yaghan|2003|p=69}} ''parachute'',{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=127}} ''scalloped'',{{sfn|Krautheimer|1980|p=121, 132}} or ''lobed'' domes,{{sfn|Ward|1915|p=116-117}} these are a type of dome divided at the base into curved segments, which follow the curve of the [[Multiview orthographic projection#Elevation|elevation]].{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=127}} "Fluted" may refer specifically to this pattern as an external feature, such as was common in [[Mamluk architecture|Mamluk Egypt]].{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=302}} The "ribs" of a dome are the radial lines of masonry that extend from the crown down to the springing.{{sfn|Dumser|2010|p=436}} The central dome of the [[Hagia Sophia]] uses the ribbed method, which accommodates a ring of windows between the ribs at the base of the dome. The central dome of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] also uses this method.

== History ==

=== Early history and simple domes ===
{{Main|History of early and simple domes}}
[[File:Apache Wickiup, Edward Curtis, 1903.jpg|thumb|left|Apache wigwam, by Edward S. Curtis, 1903]]
Cultures from [[Prehistory|pre-history]] to modern times constructed domed dwellings using local materials. Although it is not known when the first dome was created, sporadic examples of early domed structures have been discovered. The earliest discovered may be four small dwellings made of [[Mammoth]] tusks and bones. The first was found by a farmer in [[Mezhirich]], Ukraine, in 1965 while he was digging in his cellar and archaeologists unearthed three more.{{sfn|Hitchcock}} They date from 19,280 – 11,700 BC.{{sfn|Palmer|Pettitt|Bahn|2005|p=24}}

In [[Modern history|modern times]], the creation of relatively simple dome-like structures has been documented among various indigenous peoples around the world. The [[wigwam]] was made by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] using arched branches or poles covered with grass or hides. The [[Efé people]] of central Africa construct similar [[Hut (dwelling)|structures]], using leaves as shingles.{{sfn|Wilkie|Morelli|2000}} Another example is the [[igloo]], a shelter built from blocks of compact snow and used by the [[Inuit]] people, among others. The [[Himba people]] of [[Namibia]] construct "desert igloos" of [[wattle and daub]] for use as temporary shelters at seasonal cattle camps, and as permanent homes by the poor.{{sfn|Crandall|2000|p=34-35}} Extraordinarily thin [[Musgum mud huts|domes of sun-baked clay]] 20 feet in diameter, 30 feet high, and nearly parabolic in curve, are known from [[Cameroon]].{{sfn|Creswell|1915a|p=155}}

The historical development from structures like these to more sophisticated domes is not well documented. That the dome was known to early [[Mesopotamia]] may explain the existence of domes in both [[China]] and [[Western World|the West]] in the first millennium BC.{{sfn|Hill|1996|p=69}} Another explanation, however, is that the use of the dome shape in construction did not have a single point of origin and was common in virtually all cultures long before domes were constructed with enduring materials.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=6}}

Corbelled stone domes have been found from the [[Neolithic|Neolithic period]] in the [[ancient Near East]], and in the Middle East to Western Europe from antiquity. {{sfn|Leick|2003|p=64}}{{sfn|Mainstone|2001|p=116}} The kings of [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persia]] held audiences and festivals in domical tents derived from the nomadic traditions of central Asia.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=81-82}} Simple domical mausoleums existed in the Hellenistic period.{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=194}} The remains of a large domed circular hall in the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] capital city of [[Nisa, Turkmenistan|Nyssa]] has been dated to perhaps the first century AD, showing "...the existence of a monumental domical tradition in Central Asia that had hitherto been unknown and which seems to have preceded Roman Imperial monuments or at least to have grown independently from them."{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=192}} It likely had a wooden dome.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=99}}

=== Persian domes ===
{{main|History of Persian domes}}
{{See also|Gonbad}}
[[File:Sheikh Lotfallah Esfahan.JPG|thumb|right|Sheikh Lotfallah Mosque, [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]].]]
[[Iranian architecture|Persian architecture]] likely inherited an architectural tradition of dome-building dating back to the earliest Mesopotamian domes.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=957}} Due to the scarcity of wood in many areas of the [[Iranian plateau]], domes were an important part of [[vernacular architecture]] throughout Persian history.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}} The Persian invention of the [[squinch]], a series of concentric arches forming a half-cone over the corner of a room, enabled the transition from the walls of a square chamber to an octagonal base for a dome in a way reliable enough for large constructions and domes moved to the forefront of Persian architecture as a result.{{sfn|Creswell|1915a|p=148}} Pre-Islamic domes in Persia are commonly semi-elliptical, with pointed domes and those with conical outer shells being the majority of the domes in the Islamic periods.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=113}}

The area of north-eastern Iran was, along with Egypt, one of two areas notable for early developments in Islamic domed mausoleums, which appear in the tenth century.{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=192-194}} The [[Samanid Mausoleum]] in [[Transoxiana]] dates to no later than 943 and is the first to have squinches create a regular octagon as a base for the dome, which then became the standard practice. Cylindrical or polygonal plan tower tombs with conical roofs over domes also exist beginning in the 11th century.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}}

The [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]] built tower tombs, called "Turkish Triangles", as well as cube mausoleums covered with a variety of dome forms. Seljuk domes included conical, semi-circular, and pointed shapes in one or two shells. Shallow semi-circular domes are mainly found from the Seljuk era. The double-shell domes were either discontinuous or continuous.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=102, 104, 105, 113}} The domed enclosure of the [[Jameh Mosque of Isfahan]], built in 1086-7 by [[Nizam al-Mulk]], was the largest masonry dome in the Islamic world at that time, had eight ribs, and introduced a new form of corner squinch with two quarter domes supporting a short barrel vault. In 1088 Tāj-al-Molk, a rival of Nizam al-Mulk, built another dome at the opposite end of the same mosque with interlacing ribs forming five-pointed stars and pentagons. This is considered the landmark Seljuk dome, and may have inspired subsequent patterning and the domes of the Il-Khanate period. The use of tile and of plain or painted plaster to decorate dome interiors, rather than brick, increased under the Seljuks.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}}

Beginning in the [[Ilkhanate]], Persian domes achieved their final configuration of structural supports, zone of transition, drum, and shells, and subsequent evolution was restricted to variations in form and shell geometry. Characteristic of these domes are the use of high drums and several types of discontinuous double-shells, and the development of triple-shells and internal stiffeners occurred at this time. The construction of tomb towers decreased.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=105, 110}} The 7.5 meter wide double dome of [[Soltan Bakht Agha Mausoleum]] (1351–1352) is the earliest known example in which the two shells of the dome have significantly different profiles, which spread rapidly throughout the region.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=106}} The development of taller drums also continued into the Timurid period.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}} The large, bulbous, fluted domes on tall drums that are characteristic of 15th century Timurid architecture were the culmination of the Central Asian and Iranian tradition of tall domes with glazed tile coverings in blue and other colors.{{sfn|Peterson|1996|p=68}}

The domes of the [[Safavid dynasty]] (1501–1732) are characterized by a distinctive bulbous profile and are considered the last generation of Persian domes. They are generally thinner than earlier domes and are decorated with a variety of colored glazed tiles and complex vegetal patterns, and they were influential on those of other Islamic styles, such as the Mughal architecture of India.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=102, 108–109}} An exaggerated style of onion dome on a short drum, as can be seen at the [[Shah Cheragh]] (1852–1853), first appeared in the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar period]]. Domes have remained important in modern mausoleums, and domed [[Ab anbar|cisterns]] and [[Yakhchal|icehouses]] remain common sights in the countryside.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}}

=== Chinese domes ===
[[File:Model of the Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb.jpg|thumb|left|Model of the [[Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum|Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb]] (25 AD – 220 AD).]]
Very little has survived of ancient [[Chinese architecture]], due to the extensive use of timber as a building material. Brick and stone vaults used in tomb construction have survived, and the corbeled dome was used, rarely, in tombs and temples.{{sfn|Kuiper|2011|p=266-267}} The earliest true domes found in Chinese tombs were shallow cloister vaults, called ''simian jieding'', derived from the Han use of [[barrel vault]]ing. Unlike the cloister vaults of western Europe, the corners are rounded off as they rise.{{sfn|Dien|2007|p=79-80}}

A model of a tomb found with a shallow true dome from the late [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD) can be seen at the Guangzhou Museum (Canton).{{sfn|Needham|Gwei-Djen|1962|p=167}} Another, the [[Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum|Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb]], found in Hong Kong in 1955, has a design common among Eastern Han Dynasty (25 AD – 220 AD) tombs in South China: a barrel vaulted entrance leading to a domed front hall with barrel vaulted chambers branching from it in a cross shape. It is the only such tomb that has been found in Hong Kong and is exhibited as part of the [[Hong Kong Museum of History]].{{sfn|lcsd|2014}}{{sfn|Tsan-wing|Kin-wah|2001|p=294}}

During the [[Three Kingdoms]] period (220–280), the "cross-joint dome" (''siyuxuanjinshi'') was developed under the [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] and [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Western Jin]] dynasties south of the [[Yangtze River]], with arcs building out from the corners of a square room until they met and joined at the center. These domes were stronger, had a steeped angle, and could cover larger areas than the relatively shallow cloister vaults. Over time, they were made taller and wider. There were also corbel vaults, called ''diese'', although these are the weakest type.{{sfn|Dien|2007|p=79}} Some tombs of the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279) have beehive domes.{{sfn|Needham|Gwei-Djen|1962|p=167}}

[[File:Giovanni Paolo Panini - Interior of the Pantheon, Rome - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Painting by [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini]] of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome.]]
Roman domes are found in [[Thermae|baths]], villas, palaces, and tombs. [[Oculus|Oculi]] are common features.{{sfn|Lehmann|1945|p=247, 254–255}} They are customarily hemispherical in shape and partially or totally concealed on the exterior. To buttress the horizontal thrusts of a large hemispherical masonry dome, the supporting walls were built up beyond the base to at least the haunches of the dome, and the dome was then also sometimes covered with a conical or polygonal roof.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=9}}

Domes reached monumental size in the Roman [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]].{{sfn|Lehmann|1945|p=249}} Roman baths played a leading role in the development of domed construction in general, and monumental domes in particular. Modest domes in baths dating from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC are seen in [[Pompeii]], in the [[Frigidarium|cold rooms]] of the Terme Stabiane and the Terme del Foro.{{sfn|Lehmann|1945|p=249}}{{sfn|Winter|2006|p=130}} However, the extensive use of domes did not occur before the 1st century AD.{{sfn|Lancaster|2005|p=49}} The growth of domed construction increases under [[Nero|Emperor Nero]] and [[Flavian dynasty|the Flavians]] in the 1st century AD, and during the 2nd century. Centrally-planned halls become increasingly important parts of palace and palace villa layouts beginning in the 1st century, serving as state banqueting halls, audience rooms, or throne rooms.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=77}} The [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], a temple in Rome completed by [[Hadrian|Emperor Hadrian]] as part of the [[Baths of Agrippa]], is the most famous, best preserved, and largest Roman dome.{{sfn|Lehmann|1945|p=255}} Segmented domes, made of radially concave wedges or of alternating concave and flat wedges, appear under Hadrian in the 2nd century and most preserved examples of this style date from this period.{{sfn|Lancaster|2005|p=46, 50}}

In the 3rd century, Imperial mausoleums began to be built as domed rotundas, rather than as [[tumulus]] structures or other types, following similar monuments by private citizens.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=}} The technique of building lightweight domes with interlocking hollow ceramic tubes further developed in North Africa and Italy in the late third and early fourth centuries.{{sfn|McClendon|2005|p=16}} In the 4th century, Roman domes proliferated due to changes in the way domes were constructed, including advances in [[Centring|centering]] techniques and the use of brick [[Rib vault|ribbing]].{{sfn|Lancaster|2005|p=161}} The material of choice in construction gradually transitioned during the 4th and 5th centuries from stone or concrete to lighter brick in thin shells.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=238}} Baptisteries began to be built in the manner of domed mausoleums during the 4th century in Italy. The octagonal [[Lateran Baptistery|Lateran baptistery]] or the baptistery of the Holy Sepulchre may have been the first, and the style spread during the 5th century.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=56}} By the 5th century, structures with small-scale domed cross plans existed across the Christian world.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=239}}

With the end of the [[Western Roman Empire]], domes became a signature feature of the church architecture of the surviving [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] — or "Byzantine" — Empire.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=958}} 6th-century church building by the [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]] used the domed cross unit on a monumental scale, and his architects made the domed brick-vaulted central plan standard throughout the Roman east. This divergence with the Roman west from the second third of the 6th century may be considered the beginning of a "Byzantine" architecture.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=203, 242}} Justinian's [[Hagia Sophia]] was an original and innovative design with no known precedents in the way it covers a basilica plan with dome and semi-domes. Periodic earthquakes in the region have caused three partial collapses of the dome and necessitated repairs.{{sfn|Freely|Çakmak|2004|p=90-93, 95–96}}

"Cross-domed units", a more secure structural system created by bracing a dome on all four sides with broad arches, became a standard element on a smaller scale in later Byzantine church architecture.{{sfn|Ousterhout|2008b|p=358}}{{sfn|Ousterhout|2008a|p=202}} The [[Cross-in-square]] plan, with a single dome at the crossing or five domes in a quincunx pattern, became widely popular in the [[Middle byzantine art#Periods|Middle Byzantine period (c. 843–1204)]].{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=340}}{{sfn|Darling|2004|p=xliii}}{{sfn|Ousterhout|2008b|p=358}} It is the most common church plan from the tenth century until the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453.{{sfn|Rosser|2011|p=137}} Resting domes on circular or polygonal drums pierced with windows eventually became the standard style, with regional characteristics.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=379}}

In the Byzantine period, domes were normally hemispherical and had, with occasional exceptions, windowed drums. All of the surviving examples in Constantinople are ribbed or pumpkin domes, with the divisions corresponding to the number of windows. Roofing for domes ranged from simple ceramic tile to more expensive, more durable, and more form-fitting lead sheeting. Metal clamps between stone cornice blocks, metal tie rods, and metal chains were also used to stabilize domed construction.{{sfn|Ousterhout|2008a|p=214}} The technique of using double shells for domes, although revived in the Renaissance, originated in Byzantine practice.{{sfn|Wittkower|1963|p=185}}

=== Arabic and Western European domes ===
{{Main|History of Medieval Arabic and Western European domes}}
[[File:Dome of the Rock Temple Mount.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]]]]
The Syria and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] area has a long tradition of domical architecture, including wooden domes in shapes described as "conoid", or similar to pine cones. When the [[Arab Muslims|Arab Muslim]] forces [[Muslim conquest of Syria|conquered the region]], they employed local craftsmen for their buildings and, by the end of the 7th&amp;nbsp;century, the dome had begun to become an architectural symbol of [[Islam]].{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=43}} In addition to religious shrines, such as the [[Dome of the Rock]], domes were used over the audience and throne halls of [[Umayyad]] palaces, and as part of porches, pavilions, fountains, towers and the [[caldarium|calderia]] of baths. Blending the architectural features of both Byzantine and Persian architecture, the domes used both pendentives and squinches and were made in a variety of shapes and materials.{{sfn|Arce|2006|p=209}} Although architecture in the region would decline following the movement of the capital to Iraq under the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] in 750, mosques built after a revival in the late 11th century usually followed the Umayyad model.{{sfn|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=111-112}} Early versions of bulbous domes can be seen in mosaic illustrations in Syria dating to the Umayyad period. They were used to cover large buildings in Syria after the eleventh century.{{sfn|Born|1944|p=208}}

Italian church architecture from the late sixth century to the end of the eighth century was influenced less by the trends of Constantinople than by a variety of Byzantine provincial plans.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=402}} With the [[Charlemagne#Imperial coronation|crowning]] of [[Charlemagne]] as a [[Holy Roman Emperor|new Roman Emperor]], Byzantine influences were largely replaced in a revival of earlier Western building traditions. Occasional exceptions include examples of early quincunx churches at [[Milan]] and near [[Cassino]].{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=402}} Another is the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|Palatine Chapel]]. Its domed octagon design was influenced by Byzantine models.{{sfn|Dupré|2001|p=5}}{{sfn|Bullough|1991|p=57, 89}} It was the largest dome north of the Alps at that time.{{sfn|Langmead|Garnaut|2001|p=60}} [[Venice]], [[Southern Italy]] and [[Sicily]] served as outposts of Middle Byzantine architectural influence in Italy.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=405}}

The [[Cathedral–Mosque of Córdoba|Great Mosque of Córdoba]] contains the first known examples of the crossed-arch dome type.{{sfn|Fuentes|Huerta|2010|p=346-347}} The use of corner squinches to support domes was widespread in Islamic architecture by the 10th and 11th centuries.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=340}} After the ninth century, mosques in North Africa often have a small decorative dome over the mihrab. Additional domes are sometimes used at the corners of the mihrab wall, at the entrance bay, or on the square tower minarets.{{sfn|Kuban|1985|p=2-4}} Egypt, along with north-eastern Iran, was one of two areas notable for early developments in Islamic mausoleums, beginning in the 10th century.{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=194}} Fatimid mausoleums were mostly simple square buildings covered by a dome. Domes were smooth or ribbed and had a characteristic Fatimid "keel" shape profile.{{sfn|Kuiper|2011|p=165}}

Domes in [[Romanesque architecture]] are generally found within [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing tower]]s at the intersection of a church's [[nave]] and [[transept]], which conceal the domes externally.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=172}} They are typically octagonal in plan and use corner squinches to translate a square bay into a suitable octagonal base.{{sfn|Fletcher|p=}} They appear "in connection with basilicas almost throughout Europe" between 1050 and 1100.{{sfn|Porter|1928|p=48}} The [[Crusades]], beginning in 1095, also appear to have influenced domed architecture in Western Europe, particularly in the areas around the [[Mediterranean Sea]].{{sfn|Jeffery|2010|p=72}} The [[Knights Templar]], headquartered at the site, built a series of centrally planned churches throughout Europe modeled on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, with the Dome of the Rock also an influence.{{sfn|Howard|1991|p=65, 67}} In southwest France, there are over 250 domed Romanesque churches in the [[Périgord]] region alone.{{sfn|Stewart|2008|p=202}} The use of pendentives to support domes in the [[Aquitaine]] region, rather than the squinches more typical of western medieval architecture, strongly implies a Byzantine influence.{{sfn|Moffett|Fazio|Wodehouse|2003|p=}} Gothic domes are uncommon due to the use of [[rib vault]]s over naves, and with church crossings usually focused instead by a tall [[steeple (architecture)|steeple]], but there are examples of small octagonal crossing domes in cathedrals as the style developed from the Romanesque.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=174}}

Star-shaped domes found at the [[Moors|Moorish]] palace of the [[Alhambra]] in Granada, Spain, the [[Alhambra#Hall of the Abencerrajes|Hall of the Abencerrajes]] (c. 1333–91) and the Hall of the two Sisters (c. 1333–54), are extraordinarily developed examples of [[muqarnas]] domes.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=174}} In the first half of the fourteenth century, stone blocks replaced bricks as the primary building material in the dome construction of [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Egypt]] and, over the course of 250 years, around 400 domes were built in Cairo to cover the tombs of Mamluk [[sultan]]s and [[emir]]s.{{sfn|Cipriani|Lau|2006|p=696, 698}} Dome profiles were varied, with "keel-shaped", bulbous, [[ogee]], stilted domes, and others being used. On the drum, angles were [[chamfer]]ed, or sometimes stepped, externally and triple windows were used in a tri-lobed arrangement on the faces.{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1994|p=318}} Bulbous cupolas on minarets were used in Egypt beginning around 1330, spreading to Syria in the following century.{{sfn|Born|1944|p=209}} In the fifteenth century, pilgrimages to and flourishing trade relations with the [[Near East]] exposed the [[Low Countries]] of northwest Europe to the use of bulbous domes in the architecture of the [[Orient]] and such domes apparently became associated with the city of Jerusalem. Multi-story spires with truncated bulbous cupolas supporting smaller cupolas or crowns became popular in the sixteenth century.{{sfn|Born|1944|p=209-213}}

=== Russian domes ===
[[File:Onion domes of Cathedral of the Annunciation.JPG|thumb|left|[[Gilding|Gilded]] onion domes of the [[Cathedral of the Annunciation, Moscow|Cathedral of the Annunciation]], [[Moscow Kremlin]].]]
[[File:RedSquare SaintBasile (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|[[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] (1555–61) in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. Its distinctive [[onion dome]]s date to the 1680s.]]
The multidomed church is a typical form of Russian church architecture that distinguishes Russia from other Orthodox nations and Christian denominations. Indeed, the earliest Russian churches, built just after the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']], were multi-domed, which has led some historians to speculate about how Russian pre-Christian pagan temples might have looked. Examples of these early churches are the 13-domed wooden [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] (989) and the 25-domed stone [[Desyatinnaya Church]] in [[Kiev]] (989–996). The number of domes typically has a symbolical meaning in [[Russian architecture]], for example 13 domes symbolize [[Christ]] with 12 [[Apostles]], while 25 domes means the same with an additional 12 Prophets of the [[Old Testament]]. The multiple domes of Russian churches were often comparatively smaller than [[Byzantine]] domes.{{sfn|Kies}}{{sfn|skypalace}}

The earliest stone churches in Russia featured Byzantine style domes, however by the [[Early Modern era]] the [[onion dome]] had become the predominant form in traditional [[Russian architecture]]. The [[onion dome]] is a dome whose shape resembles an [[onion]], after which they are named. Such domes are often larger in diameter than the [[drum (architecture)|drum]]s they sit on, and their height usually exceeds their width. The whole bulbous structure tapers smoothly to a point. Though the earliest preserved Russian domes of such type date from the 16th century, illustrations from older chronicles indicate they have existed since the late 13th century. Like [[tented roofs]]—which were combined with, and sometimes replaced domes in Russian architecture since the 16th century—onion domes initially were used only in wooden churches. Builders introduced them into stone architecture much later, and continued to make their carcasses of either of wood or metal on top of masonry drums.{{sfn|Zagraevsky}}

Russian domes are often [[gilding|gilded]] or brightly painted. A dangerous technique of chemical [[gilding]] using [[mercury (element)|mercury]] had been applied on some occasions until the mid-19th century, most notably in the giant dome of [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]]. The more modern and safe method of [[gold]] [[electroplating]] was applied for the first time in gilding the domes of the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in [[Moscow]], the [[List of tallest Orthodox churches|tallest Eastern Orthodox church]] in the world.{{sfn|galteh}}

=== Ottoman domes ===
[[File:Selimiye Mosque, Dome.jpg|thumb|left|Selimiye Mosque dome in Edirne, Turkey]]

The rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its spread in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] and the [[Balkans]] coincided with the decline of the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Early Ottoman buildings, for almost two centuries after 1300, were characterized by a blending of Ottoman culture and indigenous architecture, and the pendentive dome was used throughout the empire.{{sfn|Hassan|Mazloomi|Omer|2010|p=125-127}} The Byzantine dome form was adopted and further developed.{{sfn|Peterson|1996|p=68}} Ottoman architecture made exclusive use of the semi-spherical dome for vaulting over even very small spaces, influenced by the earlier traditions of both [[Byzantine Anatolia]] and [[Central Asia]].{{sfn|Kuban|1987|p=75}} The smaller the structure, the simpler the plan, but mosques of medium size were also covered by single domes.{{sfn|Kuban|1987|p=93-94}} The earliest Ottoman mosques were single oblong rooms with either simple tiled pitched roofs of wood or a wooden interior dome. Most of these wooden domes have been lost to fires and replaced by flat ceilings. The earliest masonry domes covered square single room mosques, the archetype of Ottoman architecture.{{sfn|Freely|2011|p=19-20}} Examples include the Mosque of Orhan Gazi in [[Gebze]] and [[Karagöz Bey Mosque]] in [[Mostar]].{{sfn|Hassan|Mazloomi|2010|p=107}} This domed-square unit is the defining element of the three basic Ottoman mosque plans: the single unit mosque, multi-unit mosque, and eyvan (or "[[iwan]]") mosque.{{sfn|Freely|2011|p=20}}

The multi-unit mosque uses several domed-squares of similar size along the length of a mosque, or across its width, or both, with the central dome sometimes larger than the others.{{sfn|Freely|2011|p=20}} A style common in the [[Ottoman architecture#Bursa Period .281299.E2.80.931437.29|Bursa period]], and known as the "Bursa type", is like a duplication of the single-domed square, with one long space divided by an arch into two square bays that are each covered by a dome. A variation of this type has the room covered by one dome and one semi-dome, with additional side chambers. A multi-domed style derived from [[Seljuk architecture]] is that of the [[Bursa Grand Mosque|Ulu Camii]], or Great Mosque, which consists of a number of domes of the same size supported by pillars.{{sfn|Freely|2011|p=20-21}}

The eyvan mosque type (the eyvan being derived from Seljuk architecture) uses domed-square units in a variety of sizes, heights, and details, with only the possible pair of side units being similar sizes.{{sfn|Freely|2011|p=20}}

Early experiments with large domes include the domed square mosques of [[Çine]] and [[Mudurnu]] under [[Bayezid I]], and the later domed "zawiya-mosques" at Bursa. The [[Üç Şerefeli Mosque]] at Edirne developed the idea of the central dome being a larger version of the domed modules used throughout the rest of the structure to generate open space. This idea became important to the Ottoman style as it developed.{{sfn|Kuban|1987|p=75}}

The [[Bayezid II Mosque|Beyazidiye Mosque]] (1501–1506) in Istanbul begins the [[Ottoman architecture#Classical period .281437.E2.80.931703.29|Classical period]] in Ottoman architecture, in which the great [[Mosques commissioned by the Ottoman dynasty|Imperial Mosques]], with variations, resemble the former Byzantine basilica of [[Hagia Sophia]] in having a large central dome with semi-domes of the same span to the east and west.{{sfn|Freely|2011|p=21-22}} Hagia Sophia's central dome arrangement is faithfully reproduced in three Ottoman mosques in Istanbul: the Beyazidiye Mosque, the [[Kılıç Ali Pasha Complex|Kılıç Ali Pasha Mosque]], and the [[Süleymaniye Mosque]].{{sfn|Kuban|1987|p=84}} Three other Imperial mosques in Istanbul also add semi-domes to the north and south, doing away with the basilica plan: [[Şehzade Mosque|Şehzade Camii]], [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque|Sultan Ahmed I Camii]], and [[New Mosque (Istanbul)|Yeni Cami]].{{sfn|Freely|2011|p=22}} The peak of this classical period, which lasted into the 17th century, came with the architecture of [[Mimar Sinan]]. {{sfn|Freely|2011|p=21}} In addition to large Imperial mosques, he produced hundreds of other monuments, including medium-sized mosques such as the [[Mihrimah Sultan Mosque (Edirnekapı)|Mihrimah]], [[Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque (Kadırga)|Sokollu]], and [[Rüstem Pasha Mosque]] and the [[Türbe|tomb]] of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].{{sfn|Kuban|1987|p=91}} Süleymaniye Mosque, built in Constantinople (modern [[Istanbul]]) from 1550 to 1557, has a main dome 53&amp;nbsp;meters high with a diameter of 26.5&amp;nbsp;meters. At the time it was built, the dome was the highest in the [[Ottoman Empire]] when measured from sea level, but lower from the floor of the building and smaller in diameter than that of the nearby Hagia Sophia.

Another Classical domed mosque type is, like the [[Little Hagia Sophia|Byzantine church of Sergius and Bacchus]], the domed polygon within a square. Octagons and hexagons were common, such as those of [[Üç Şerefeli Mosque]] (1437–1447) and [[Selimiye Mosque]] in Edirne.{{sfn|Freely|2011|p=22-23}} The [[Selimiye Mosque]] was the first structure built by the Ottomans that had a larger dome than that of the Hagia Sophia. The dome rises above a square bay. Corner semi-domes convert this into an octagon, which muqarnas transition to a circular base. The dome has an average internal diameter of about 31.5 meters, while that of Hagia Sophia averages 31.3 meters.{{sfn|Kuban|1987|p=89}} Designed and built by architect Mimar Sinan between 1568 and 1574, when he finished it he was 86 years old, and he considered the mosque his masterpiece.

The first large Imperial Mosque of Istanbul in the imported Baroque style was the [[Nuruosmaniye Mosque]] (1748–1755). One of the finest was the [[Laleli Mosque]] of 1759–1764.{{sfn|Freely|2011|p=23}}

=== Italian Renaissance domes ===
{{Main|History of Italian Renaissance domes}}
[[File:Santa Maria del Fiore.jpg|thumb|left|[[Florence Cathedral|The Cathedral]] of [[Florence]] with [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]'s dome, Italy]]
[[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s octagonal brick domical vault over [[Florence Cathedral]] was built between 1420 and 1436 and the lantern surmounting the dome was completed in 1467. The dome is 42 meters wide and made of two shells.{{sfn|Schütz|2002|p=356–357}} The dome is not itself Renaissance in style, although the lantern is closer.{{sfn|Frankl|Crossley|2000|p=213}} A combination of dome, drum, pendentives, and barrel vaults developed as the characteristic structural forms of large Renaissance churches following a period of innovation in the later fifteenth century.{{sfn|Betts|1993|p=5}} Florence was the first Italian city to develop the new style, followed by Rome and then Venice.{{sfn|Nuttgens|1997|p=181}} Brunelleschi's domes at [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|San Lorenzo]] and the [[Pazzi Chapel]] established them as a key element of Renaissance architecture.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=304}} His plan for the dome of the Pazzi Chapel in Florence's [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Basilica of Santa Croce]] (1430–52) illustrates the Renaissance enthusiasm for geometry and for the circle as geometry's supreme form. This emphasis on geometric essentials would be very influential.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=175–176}}

''[[De Re Aedificatoria]]'', written by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] around 1452, recommends vaults with coffering for churches, as in the Pantheon, and the first design for a dome at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome is usually attributed to him, although the recorded architect is [[Bernardo Rossellino]]. This would culminate in [[Bramante]]'s 1505–06 projects for a wholly new [[St. Peter's Basilica]], marking the beginning of the displacement of the Gothic ribbed vault with the combination of dome and barrel vault, which proceeded throughout the sixteenth century.{{sfn|Betts|1993|p=5–7}} Bramante's initial design was for a Greek cross plan with a large central hemispherical dome and four smaller domes around it in a [[quincunx]] pattern. Work began in 1506 and continued under a succession of builders over the next 120 years.{{sfn|Nuttgens|1997|p=184}} The dome was completed by [[Giacomo della Porta]] and [[Domenico Fontana]].{{sfn|Nuttgens|1997|p=184}} The publication of [[Sebastiano Serlio]]'s treatise, one of the most popular architectural treatises ever published, was responsible for the spread of the oval in late Renaissance and Baroque architecture throughout Italy, Spain, France, and central Europe.{{sfn|Huerta|2007|p=230–232}}

The [[Villa Capra "La Rotonda"|Villa Capra]], also known as "La Rotunda", was built by [[Andrea Palladio]] from 1565 to 1569 near [[Vicenza]]. Its highly symmetrical square plan centers on a circular room covered by a dome, and it proved highly influential on the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian architects]] of 18th century England, architects in Russia, and architects in America, [[Thomas Jefferson]] among them. Palladio's two domed churches in Venice are [[Church of San Giorgio Maggiore|San Giorgio Maggiore]] (1565–1610) and [[Il Redentore]] (1577–92), the latter built in thanksgiving for the end of a bad outbreak of [[Bubonic plague|plague]] in the city.{{sfn|Nuttgens|1997|p=187–189}} The spread of the Renaissance-style dome outside of Italy began with central Europe, although there was often a stylistic delay of a century or two.{{sfn|Melaragno|1991|p=73}}

[[File:Taj Mahal 2012.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Taj Mahal]] in [[Agra]], [[India]] built by [[Shah Jahan]].]]
[[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Islamic rule over northern and central India]] brought with it the use of domes constructed with stone, brick and mortar, and iron dowels and cramps. Centering was made from timber and bamboo. The use of iron cramps to join together adjacent stones was known in pre-Islamic India, and was used at the base of domes for hoop reinforcement. The synthesis of styles created by this introduction of new forms to the [[Hindu temple architecture|Hindu tradition]] of [[Post and lintel|trabeate]] construction created a distinctive architecture.{{sfn|Tappin|2003|p=1941, 1943–1944}} Domes in pre-Mughal India have a standard squat circular shape with a lotus design and bulbous finial at the top, derived from Hindu architecture. Because the Hindu architectural tradition did not include arches, flat corbels were used to transition from the corners of the room to the dome, rather than squinches.{{sfn|Peterson|1996|p=68}} In contrast to Persian and Ottoman domes, the domes of Indian tombs tend to be more bulbous.{{sfn|Nuttgens|1997|p=157}}

The earliest examples include the half-domes of the late 13th century [[tomb of Balban]] and the small dome of the tomb of Khan Shahid, which were made of roughly cut material and would have needed covering surface finishes.{{sfn|Tappin|2003|p=1944, 1946–1947}} Under the [[Lodi dynasty]] there was a large proliferation of tomb building, with octagonal plans reserved for royalty and square plans used for others of high rank, and the first double dome was introduced to India in this period.{{sfn|Tappin|2003|p=1948}} The first major [[Mughal architecture|Mughal building]] is the domed [[Humayun's Tomb|tomb of Humayun]], built between 1562 and 1571 by a Persian architect. The central double dome covers an octagonal central chamber about 15 meters wide and is accompanied by small domed [[Chhatri|chattri]] made of brick and faced with stone.{{sfn|Tappin|2003|p=1944, 1948–1949}} [[Chhatri|Chatri]]s, the domed kiosks on pillars characteristic of Mughal roofs, were adopted from their Hindu use as [[cenotaph]]s.{{sfn|Peterson|1996|p=200}} The fusion of Persian and Indian architecture can be seen in the dome shape of the [[Taj Mahal]]: the bulbous shape derives from Persian Timurid domes, and the [[finial]] with lotus leaf base is derived from Hindu temples.{{sfn|Peterson|1996|p=68}} The [[Gol Gumbaz]], or ''Round Dome'', is one of the largest masonry domes in the world. It has an internal diameter of 41.15 meters and a height of 54.25 meters.{{sfn|Tappin|2003|p=1949-1950}} The dome was the most technically advanced built in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]].{{sfn|Michell|Zebrowski|1987|p=15}} The last major Islamic tomb built in India was the [[Tomb of Safdarjung|tomb of Safdar Jang]] (1753–54). The central dome is reportedly triple-shelled, with two relatively flat inner brick domes and an outer bulbous marble dome, although it may actually be that the marble and second brick domes are joined everywhere but under the lotus leaf finial at the top.{{sfn|Tappin|2003|p=1950-1951}}

[[File:St Paul's Cathedral Dome from One New Change - Square Crop.jpg|thumb|left|The dome of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in London]]
In the early sixteenth century, the lantern of the Italian dome spread to Germany, gradually adopting the bulbous cupola from the Netherlands.{{sfn|Born|1944|p=214-215}} Russian architecture strongly influenced the many bulbous domes of the wooden churches of [[Bohemia]] and [[Silesia]] and, in [[Bavaria]], bulbous domes less resemble Dutch models than Russian ones. Domes like these gained in popularity in central and southern Germany and in Austria in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, particularly in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]], and influenced many bulbous cupolas in Poland and Eastern Europe in the Baroque period. However, many bulbous domes in eastern Europe were replaced over time in the larger cities during the second half of the eighteenth century in favor of hemispherical or stilted cupolas in the French or Italian styles.{{sfn|Born|1944|p=218-220}}

The construction of domes in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries relied primarily on empirical techniques and oral traditions rather than the architectural treatises of the times, which avoided practical details. This was adequate for domes up to medium size, with diameters in the range of 12 to 20 meters. Materials were considered homogeneous and rigid, with compression taken into account and elasticity ignored. The weight of materials and the size of the dome were the key references. Lateral tensions in a dome were counteracted with horizontal rings of iron, stone, or wood incorporated into the structure.{{sfn|Fusco|Villanni|2003|p=580-581}}

Over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, developments in mathematics and the study of [[statics]] led to a more precise formalization of the ideas of the traditional constructive practices of arches and vaults, and there was a diffusion of studies on the most stable form for these structures: the [[catenary]] curve.{{sfn|Bagliani|2009}} [[Robert Hooke]], who first articulated that a thin arch was comparable to an inverted hanging chain, may have advised Wren on how to achieve the crossing dome of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]]. Wren's structural system became the standard for large domes well into the 19th century.{{sfn|Mark|Billington|1989|p=314-315}} The ribs in [[Guarino Guarini]]'s San Lorenzo and Il Sidone were shaped as [[catenary arch]]es.{{sfn|Nuttgens|1997|p=210}} The idea of a large oculus in a solid dome revealing a second dome originated with him.{{sfn|Wittkower|1999|p=48}} He also established the oval dome as a reconciliation of the longitudinal plan church favored by the liturgy of the Counter-Reformation and the centralized plan favored by idealists.{{sfn|Earls|1971|p=128}} Because of the imprecision of oval domes in the [[Rococo]] period, drums were problematic and the domes instead often rested directly on arches or pendentives.{{sfn|Earls|1971|p=135-36}}

In the eighteenth century, the study of dome structures changed radically, with domes being considered as a composition of smaller elements, each subject to mathematical and mechanical laws and easier to analyse individually, rather than being considered as whole units unto themselves.{{sfn|Bagliani|2009}} Although never very popular in domestic settings, domes were used in a number of 18th century homes built in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-Classical]] style.{{sfn|Palmer|2009|p=92-93}} In the United States, most public buildings in the late 18th century were only distinguishable from private residences because they featured cupolas.{{sfn|Allen|2001|p=13}}

[[File:Eden Project geodesic domes panorama.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.8|[[Geodesic dome]]s of the [[Eden Project]] in United Kingdom]]
The [[Historicism (art)|historicism]] of the 19th century led to many domes being re-translations of the great domes of the past, rather than further stylistic developments, especially in sacred architecture.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=190}} New production techniques allowed for [[cast iron]] and [[wrought iron]] to be produced both in larger quantities and at relatively low prices during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Russia, which had large supplies of iron, has some of the earliest examples of iron's architectural use.{{sfn|Gayle|Gayle|1998|p=13-14, 18, 26}} Excluding those that simply imitated multi-shell masonry, metal framed domes such as the elliptical dome of [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London (57 to 67 meters in diameter) and the circular dome of the [[Halle au Blé (Paris)|Halle au Blé]] in Paris may represent the century's chief development of the simple domed form.{{sfn|Mainstone|2001|p=241}} Cast-iron domes were particularly popular in France.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=304}}

The practice of building rotating domes for [[Observatory|housing large telescopes]] was begun in the 19th century, with early examples using papier-mâché to minimize weight.{{sfn|Lippincott|2008|p=26}} Unique glass domes springing straight from ground level were used for [[Greenhouse|hothouses]] and [[winter garden]]s.{{sfn|Kohlmaier|Von Sartory|1991|p=126-127}} Elaborate covered [[Arcade (architecture)|shopping arcades]] included large [[glazing (window)|glazed]] domes at their cross intersections.{{sfn|Coleman|2006|p=32}} The large domes of the 19th century included [[Convention center|exhibition buildings]] and functional structures such as [[Gas holder|gasometers]] and [[Motive power depot|locomotive sheds]].{{sfn|Kohlmaier|Von Sartory|1991|p=126}} The "first fully triangulated framed dome" was built in Berlin in 1863 by [[Johann Wilhelm Schwedler]] and, by the start of the 20th century, similarly triangulated frame domes had become fairly common.{{sfn|Mainstone|2001|p=171}}{{sfn|Dimčić|2011|p=8}} [[Vladimir Shukhov]] was also an early pioneer of what would later be called [[gridshell]] structures and in 1897 he employed them in domed exhibit pavilions at the All-Russia Industrial and Art Exhibition.{{sfn|Dimčić|2011|p=8}}

Domes built with steel and concrete were able to achieve very large spans.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=304}} In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Guastavino family, a father and son team who worked on the eastern seaboard of the United States, further developed the masonry dome, using [[Guastavino tile|tiles]] set flat against the surface of the curve and fast-setting [[Portland cement]], which allowed mild steel bar to be used to counteract tension forces.{{sfn|Mainstone|2001|p=129}} The thin domical shell was further developed with the construction by [[Walther Bauersfeld]] of two [[planetarium]] domes in [[Jena]], Germany in the early 1920s. They consisting of a triangulated frame of light steel bars and mesh covered by a thin layer of concrete.{{sfn|Mainstone|2001|p=134}} These are generally taken to be the first modern architectural [[Thin-shell structure|thin shells]].{{sfn|Bradshaw|Campbell|Gargari|Mirmiran|Tripeny|2002|p=693}} These are also considered the first [[geodesic dome]]s.{{sfn|Langmead|Garnaut|2001|p=131}} Geodesic domes have been used for radar enclosures, greenhouses, housing, and weather stations.{{sfn|Langmead|Garnaut|2001|p=131-132}} Architectural shells had their heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, peaking in popularity shortly before the widespread adoption of computers and the [[finite element method]] of [[structural analysis]].{{sfn|Bradshaw|Campbell|Gargari|Mirmiran|Tripeny|2002|p=693-694, 697}}

The first permanent [[Air-supported structure|air supported]] membrane domes were the [[Radome|radar domes]] designed and built by Walter Bird after World War II. Their low cost eventually led to the development of permanent versions using teflon-coated fiberglass and by 1985 the majority of the domed stadiums around the world used this system.{{sfn|Bradshaw|Campbell|Gargari|Mirmiran|Tripeny|2002|p=701-702}} [[Tensegrity]] domes, patented by Buckminster Fuller in 1962, are [[membrane structure]]s consisting of radial trusses made from steel cables under tension with vertical steel pipes spreading the cables into the truss form. They have been made circular, elliptical, and other shapes to cover stadiums from Korea to Florida.{{sfn|Levy|Salvadori|2002|p=322-323}} Tension membrane design has depended upon computers, and the increasing availability of powerful computers resulted in many developments being made in the last three decades of the 20th century.{{sfn|Bradshaw|Campbell|Gargari|Mirmiran|Tripeny|2002|p=700, 703}} The higher expense of rigid large span domes made them relatively rare, although rigidly moving panels is the most popular system for sports stadiums with [[retractable roof]]ing.{{sfn|Charlier}}{{sfn|Friedman|Farkas|2011|p=49}}

'''Donia Esther Nachshen''' (22 January 1903 – 1987) was a Ukrainian-born British book illustrator and poster artist who is now best known for the posters she produced for the British government during World War Two.&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Slocombe|publisher=Imperial War Museum|year=2014|title=British Posters of the Second World War |ISBN=978-1-904897-92-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Telegraph Less Art.IWMPST4041.jpg|thumb|''Telegraph Less'' (1943) (Art.IWM PST 4041)]]
Nachshen was born in the city of [[Zhitomir]], which was then part of Russia and is now in the Ukraine. Nachshen was born into a Jewish family and after an anti-Jewish [[pogrom]] in the city in 1905, the family fled Zhitomir and eventually settled in London. Nachshen did well at school in London and enrolled in the [[Slade School of Art]].&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"/&gt; By the 1920s she had established herself as a successful book designer.&lt;ref name="Houfe"&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Houfe|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|year=1996|title=The Dictionary of 19th Century British Book Illustrators |ISBN=1 85149 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; She illustrated translations of works by [[Arthur Schnitzler]] and the Nobel Prize winner [[Anatole France]] in a style based on Russian folk art and art deco elements.&lt;ref name="AFrance"&gt;{{cite web|author=The Collection Online|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/363903 |title=''She has taken great pains in honor of her husband's memory, who was said to loved Italian art'' |date=|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AF2"&gt;{{cite web|author=The Collection Online|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/363901?|title=''While he was talking of every-day matters, her mind was in a reverie far away'' |date=|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nachshen also illustrated a version of the Jewish text the ''[[Haggadah]]'' in 1934 and also illustrated editions of works by [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]].&lt;ref name="Bexl"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr Bex Lewis|url=http://drbexl.co.uk/2010/01/24/donia-nachshen/ |title=Donia Nachshen |date=24 January 2010|publisher=drbexl.co.uk|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War Two, Nachshen produced poster designs for a number of high-profile campaigns, notably the ''Make Do and Mend'' campaign run by the [[Board of Trade]] and also ''Telegraph Less'' for the [[General Post Office]]. She continued with her book illustration work during the War, producing designs for versions of ''[[Diary of a Madman (short story)|Diary of a Madman]]'' by [[Nikolai Gogol]] and a 1945 collection of short stories by [[Feodor Dostoyevsky]] as well as books by [[Enid Blyton]].&lt;ref name="Horne"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Horne|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|year=1994|title=The Dictionary of 20th Century British Book Illustrators |ISBN=1 85149 1082}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the War, Nachshen lived in London and continued to illustrate Russian novels and poetry, mainly for the publishers [[Constable &amp; Robinson|Constable &amp; Co]] and also for the Lindsay Drummond company.&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"/&gt; For the Russian novels, Nachshen used [[scraperboard]] to create dramatic illustrations that resembled a style of eastern European woodcuts, while for the childrens' book that she illustrated she used much lighter pen drawings.&lt;ref name="Horne"/&gt;

[[File:백자 철화운룡문 항아리.jpg|thumb|[[Joseon white porcelain]] jar with underglaze iron dragon and cloud design ([[National Treasure (South Korea)|National Treasure]])]]
A '''dragon jar''', also known as '''cloud-dragon jar''', is a type of ceremonial [[porcelain]] vessel that became popular among the ruling classes of [[Korea]] during the [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392–1910). They are decorated with large dragons against a background of stylized clouds, painted with [[underglaze]] pigments.

In addition to being a generally auspicious symbol, the dragon represented the authority and beneficence of the ruler.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/booklets/5_32_8_0.html Gallery label, Philadelphia Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1754, [[Yeongjo of Joseon|King Yòngjo]] decreed that iron pigments were to be used exclusively, except for jars having a dragon design.&lt;ref&gt;Covell, Jon Carter &amp; Alan Covell, ''The World of Korean Ceramics'', Seoul, Si-sa Yong-o-sa, 1986, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the scarcity of the traditional [[cobalt blue]] pigment, which was imported from Muslim [[Turkestan]], and was also known as “Mohammedan blue”, an [[underglaze]] brown [[iron oxide]] pigment was also used between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsconnected.org/resource/1693/dragon-jar Gallery label, Minneapolis Institute of Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Essential English Library''''' is a series of books, some [[fiction]] and some non-fiction, intended mainly for foreign students, though it is hoped that English readers may also find them of interest. The fiction has been chosen from some of the best writers, old and new, of [[English novel]]s, [[short stories]] and plays. The non-fiction consists of completely new books specially written for this series, on various aspects of [[England|English]] life and institutions.

The books are meant for serious adult students, and, though the vocabulary is carefully controlled, the style is natural and vigorous, and there is no question of any childish "writing down." The vocabulary is fundamentally that of the four books of Essential English. But, to widen the students' knowledge of the language, the same principle has been adopted in this series as in the later books of Essential English. So a number of new words (averaging three or four to a page) occur in each volume, but every new word is given, with the [[phonetic]] transcription, in the [[Glossary]] at the end of the book, and each word in the Glossary is defined within the vocabulary of ''Essential English''.

All the books are about the same length, and are illustrated with photographs or line drawings.&lt;ref&gt;The Country of the Blind and Other Stories, Fourth Impression 1954, [[Longmans, Green and Co]]. LTD.&lt;/ref&gt;

English teacher [[Charles Ewart Eckersley]] wrote ''Essential English for Foreign Students'', volumes 1-4, which were published by [[Longmans, Green and Co]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Essential English for Foreign Students [4 vols.]|url=https://www.librarything.com/work/9761053|publisher=Library Thing|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''The Finnish Folk Art Museum''' is located on the grounds of the [[Pasadena Museum of History]] in [[Pasadena, California]]. The only museum of its type in the United States, it was created in 1974 by Yrjo Alfred Paloheimo, a native of [[Finland]], who was the husband of Leonora “Babsie” Curtin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pasadena Museum of History|url=http://pasadenahistory.org|website=Pasadena Museum of History|accessdate=May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paloheimo served as Finland’s consular officer in Southern California, Arizona, and New Mexico. For 17 years, Finland’s consulate offices were located in the mansion. Paloheimo founded the Finlandia Foundation and established Jawanpaa, Finland, as Pasadena’s sister city in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finlandia Foundation National|url=http://finlandiafoundation.org/about-ffn/e-news-signup/|website=Finlandia Foundation National|accessdate=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his wife also adopted four Finnish children who were reared on the Fenyes Estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fenyes Mansion Docent Manual|date=March 2008| publisher=Pasadena Museum of History|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss chalet-like structure, constructed of redwood with a stone roof, was built in 1910 as a garage for Arthur Fleming’s Wigmore Estate. Fleming’s architect, [[Frederick Roehrig]], also designed portions of the [[Green Hotel]] in Pasadena. In 1949 Paloheimo learned that the unusual structure was for sale, and moved it onto the grounds of the Fenyes Estate to serve as a folk art museum, guest house, and sauna. Paloheimo filled the building with farmhouse furnishings he collected from several provinces in Finland, and did much of the stone work and gardening himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fenyes Mansion Docent Manual|date=March 2008|publisher=Pasadena Museum of History|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside the museum, a large living room called a “Tupa” is furnished with early 19th Century Finnish peasant furniture and objects. Visitors may see an open hearth or “Takka” used for heating and cooking, poles and overhead racks called “Leipavartaat” for storing rye sourdough bread, and “Tuoli” or chairs hand-carved by farmers as bridal gifts to their daughters, as well as many other Finnish hand-made items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saraii, Jon L,|title=Black Ties and Miners’ Boots: Inventing Finnish-American Philanthropy: A History of Finlandia Foundation|date=2003|publisher=Finlandia Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Finnish Folk Art Museum and Finlandia Gardens were officially dedicated in 1974. Currently maintained by the [[Pasadena Museum of History]], tours of the folk art museum are often included in Feynes Estate tours&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pasadena Museum of History|url=http://pasadenahistory.org|website=Pasadena Museum of History|accessdate=June 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orange Order was founded in 1795 to commemorate the Protestant [[William III of England|King William III of England, Scotland and Ireland]]'s victory in the [[Glorious Revolution]] against the [[Roman Catholic]] [[James II of England|King James II]]. The flag was adopted shortly afterwards on the grounds that it was purportedly the flag that King William had used as his personal standard at the [[Battle of the Boyne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Derek |last=Gregory |title=Violent Geographies: Fear, Terror, and Political Violence |page=9 |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=1135929068}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, the [[Irish Unionist Party]]'s [[Sir Edward Carson]] marched behind the flag of the Orange Order from [[Ulster Hall]] in leading people to publicly sign the [[Ulster Covenant]] at [[Belfast City Hall]] against the [[Irish Home Rule Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/about-ulster-covenant |title=About the Ulster Covenant |publisher=nidirect |date= |accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events were reenacted 100 years later in 2012 including a number of Northern Ireland's unionist political leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-northern-ireland-19769173/n-ireland-s-first-minister-at-ulster-covenant-re-enactment |title=N Ireland's first minister at Ulster Covenant re-enactment |work=BBC News |date= |accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Foggy Dew'''" or "'''Foggy, Foggy Dew'''" is an English [[Folk music|folk song]]. The song describes the outcome of an affair between a young weaver and a girl he courted for some time. She initially comes to his bed because she is afraid of the "foggy, foggy dew" but it seems she often returned. Early versions of the song refer to her fear of the "[[Bogeyman|bugaboo]]" rather than the foggy dew.&lt;ref&gt;Norm Cohen, ''Folk Music: A Regional Exploration'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005, p.286.&lt;/ref&gt; It is cataloged as [[George Malcolm Laws|Laws]] No. O03 and [[Roud Folk Song Index]] No. 558.

=="Foggy, Foggy Dew"==
The song is a lamentful ballad of a lover. It was published on a [[broadside (music)|broadside]] around 1815, though there are very many versions:  [[Cecil Sharp]] collected eight versions.&lt;ref name=the&gt;[http://www.mysongbook.de/msb/songs/f/foggydw1.html The Foggy Dew]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Burl Ives]], who popularized the song in the United States in the 1940s, claimed that a version dated to [[colonial America]], and he was once jailed in [[Mona, Utah]], for singing it in public, when authorities deemed it a bawdy song.&lt;ref&gt;Burl Ives (1948). ''The Wayfarying Stranger''. New York: Whittlesey House,  pp. 129-131.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[BBC Radio]] likewise restricted broadcast of the song to programmes covering folk tunes or the works of [[Benjamin Britten]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=Russell Davies|author=Russell Davies|publisher=BBC Radio 2|date=21 September 2008|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/davies/|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tune is a late 18th or early 19th century revision of "When I First Came to Court", licensed in 1689.{{cn|date=July 2013}}  

''When I was a bachelor, I liv'd all alone''&lt;br/&gt;
''I worked at the weaver's trade''&lt;br/&gt;
''And the only, only thing that I ever did wrong''&lt;br/&gt;
''Was to woo a fair young maid.''&lt;br/&gt;
''I wooed her in the wintertime''&lt;br/&gt;
''And in the summer, too''&lt;br/&gt;
''And the only, only thing that I did that was wrong''&lt;br/&gt;
''Was to keep her from the foggy, foggy dew.''

''One night she came to my bedside''&lt;br/&gt;
''When I was fast asleep.''&lt;br/&gt;
''She laid her head upon my bed''&lt;br/&gt;
''And she began to weep.''&lt;br/&gt;
''She sighed, she cried, she damn near died''&lt;br/&gt;
''She said what shall I do?''&lt;br/&gt;
''So I hauled her into bed and covered up her head''&lt;br/&gt;
''Just to keep her from the foggy foggy dew.''

''So, I am a bachelor, I live with my son''&lt;br/&gt;
''And we work at the weaver's trade.''&lt;br/&gt;
''And every single time that I look into his eyes''&lt;br/&gt;
''He reminds me of that fair young maid.''&lt;br/&gt;
''He reminds me of the wintertime''&lt;br/&gt;
''And of the summer, too,''&lt;br/&gt;
''And of the many, many times that I held her in my arms''&lt;br/&gt;
''Just to keep her from the foggy, foggy, dew.''&lt;ref&gt;Version from ''Folksongs'' Arr. [[Benjamin Britten]], Perf. [[Peter Pears]], London Records&lt;/ref&gt;

A further verse, generally used as the penultimate one, is:

''Twas in the first part of the night''&lt;br/&gt;
''That we did sport and play''&lt;br/&gt;
''And in the second part of the night''&lt;br/&gt;
''She in my arms did lay''&lt;br/&gt;
''When morning came, she said to me''&lt;br/&gt;
''Oh sir, I am undone.''&lt;br/&gt;
''Oh hold your row, you silly young gal&lt;br&gt;
''The foggy dew is gone''.&lt;br&gt;''

The episode lampoons the popularity of [[freemium]] mobile apps such as ''[[The Simpsons: Tapped Out]]''&lt;ref name="Crave Online"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tamburro|first1=Paul|title=South Park Trashes "Freemium" Games Like The Simpsons: Tapped Out|url=http://www.craveonline.com/gaming/articles/785185-south-park-trashes-freemium-games-like-simpsons-tapped|website=[[CraveOnline]]|date=November 6, 2014|accessdate=July 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DVD commentary"/&gt; and ''[[Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff]]''.&lt;ref name="DVD commentary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kuchera|first1=Ben|title=South Park's free-to-play jokes were based on a Family Guy game|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/11/12/7203487/south-park-freemium-family-guy|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=November 12, 2014|accessdate=May 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode links [[addiction]] to freemium games to other addictions, including [[alcoholism]] and [[gambling addiction]], and their possible genetic predisposition.

The episode was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program]] at the [[67th Primetime Emmy Awards]].

==Plot==
[[List of students at South Park Elementary#Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] runs into [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] at school and tells him about the newest game, a mobile app (which closely resembles the game ''Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff''&lt;ref name="polygon.com"/&gt;) based on [[List of recurring South Park characters#Terrance and Phillip|Terrance and Phillip]], and encourages Kyle to download it, since it is free. As Kyle plays, he discovers that the game offers freemium upgrades. In [[Canada]], the Prince of Canada and the Minister of Mobile Gaming are amazed at the profits they are getting, when Terrance and Phillip enter, angry that their likenesses have been used to make a game without consulting them and how it is not free, since it charges premiums. The Prince and Minister disclose they have purposefully created a boring game based on the concept of [[role-playing video game|mobile RPGs]], and that everyone is doing it.

[[Randy and Sharon Marsh]] yell at [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] for spending $489 on the app. Randy worries that Stan may have a gambling problem due to [[List of South Park families#Grampa Marsh|Grampa Marvin Marsh]] having [[compulsive gambling]] issues, as Sharon accuses Randy of having his own compulsive issues with alcohol. Terrance and Phillip begrudgingly accept that since everyone is making boring games and getting [[micropayment]]s for them, then it must be acceptable. Stan is visited by Kyle, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] because Stan skipped school just to play. They realize that Jimmy told them all about the game. Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny confront Jimmy and make him admit that he is being paid to push the game to others. Terrance and Phillip raise concerns about people spending too much money on micropayments, so the Prince and the Minister agree to fund a campaign to play the game in moderation, much like [[alcohol advertising|alcohol industry advertisements]] do. Randy takes Stan to see Marvin, who is addicted to a [[slot machine]], and then confronts Stan and Marvin about their obsessive personalities, as Marvin retorts that Randy is obsessive about alcohol. Stan and Grampa agree to stop their addictive spending.

Jimmy confesses that he has been pushing the game like a drug dealer because he is addicted to another freemium game, and compares freemium games to drug addictions.  Stan gets multiple text alerts about the game and cannot stop himself from playing again, now having charged over $26,000, while Randy's alcohol consumption increases. Stan goes to Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, and Jimmy for help. Jimmy encourages Stan to seek out a higher power for help, much like [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] and other similar [[twelve-step program]]s. Kyle makes a convoluted plan to tell people how Canada has been hiring pushers to get people addicted, but Cartman instead just [[tweet (Twitter)|tweets]] the information, and it starts [[Twitter#Trending topics|trending]]. Terrance and Phillip again are angered, as the Minister reveals that he had always planned to exploit the addictive nature of people with the game. Stan prays for help, but is visited by [[Satan]], who explains to him what addictions are.

As Terrance and Phillip continue to listen to the Minister explain his plan, the Minister reveals himself to be the Canadian devil, Beelzaboot (a [[portmanteau]] of [[beelzebub]] and the [[Canadian raising]] pronunciation of "about"). Satan realizes that the game is from Canada, so he possesses Stan, then heads to Canada to battle Beelzaboot. Satan defeats Beelzaboot, and Stan is returned to South Park unharmed. The Prince vows to never produce any more freemium games. While Stan and Marvin play board games to counter their addictive natures, Randy offers to place bets on the outcome.

==Production==
[[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] called "Freemium Isn't Free" their favorite episode of the season.&lt;ref name="The Magic Bush Commentary"&gt;{{cite serial|title= [[South Park (season 18)|South Park: Season 18]]|episode=[[The Magic Bush]]|series=[[South Park]]|last=Parker|first=Trey|authorlink=Trey Parker|last2=Stone|first2=Matt|authorlink2=Matt Stone|network=[[Comedy Central]]|airdate=September 24 – December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the DVD audio commentary for this episode, they discussed how the episode formed. Parker and Stone had been pitched by several different companies on the idea of creating a freemium mobile game based on the ''South Park'' franchise. They were unsure about actually creating the game because they thought the types of games freemium games usually result in were "pretty offensive" in shamelessly asking for money so they decided to do a "shit load of research". During this time, they decided to go ahead and make an episode that revolves around freemium games. The research Parker and Stone did was originally only for fully understanding freemium games but because they had decided to make this episode, the research was very beneficial for the episode.&lt;ref name="DVD commentary"&gt;{{cite serial|title=[[South Park (season 18)|South Park: Season 18]]|episode= Freemium Isn't Free|series=[[South Park]]|last=Parker|first=Trey|authorlink=Trey Parker|last2=Stone|first2=Matt|authorlink2=Matt Stone|network=[[Comedy Central]]|airdate=September 24 – December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The episode generally received above average reviews from critics. The episode received a B− rating from ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s Josh Modell, though he felt that it "dragged a lot".&lt;ref name="A.V. Club Review"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Modell|first1=Josh|title=Review: South Park: "Freemium Isn't Free"|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/south-park-freemium-isnt-free-211498|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|accessdate=November 6, 2014|date=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]]'s contributor Max Nicholson gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10, commenting that "it took awhile for this episode to  get off the ground, but once it did, it was pretty entertaining".&lt;ref name="IGN Review"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicholson|first1=Max|title=South Park: "Freemium Isn't Free" Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/06/south-park-freemium-isnt-free-review|website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=November 6, 2014|date=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chris Longo from [[Den of Geek]] only gave the episode 2 out of 5 stars, calling the episode, along with the previous week's episode "[[The Magic Bush]]", "the two weakest episodes of the season".&lt;ref name="Den of Geek Review"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Longo|first1=Chris|title=South Park: Freemium Isn't Free Review|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/south-park/241048/south-park-freemium-isn-t-free-review|website=[[Den of Geek]]|accessdate=November 7, 2014|date=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Funky Bones''''' is a public artwork by [[Atelier Van Lieshout]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist collective led by [[Joep van Lieshout]], located in the [[100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park]], which is on the grounds of the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]].  The artwork, primarily made from [[fiberglass]], consists of twenty white and black [[bone]]-shaped benches.

==Description==
''Funky Bones'' is situated in the Meadow region just south of the lake at 100 Acres.  It is a site-specific artwork consisting of twenty white bone-shaped benches inscribed with black drawings of bones that together form a large stylized human [[skeleton]]. The artwork was constructed primarily from fiberglass, [[plywood]], and [[concrete]]. Each bench is a fiberglass shell filled with a lightweight foam material. The fiberglass surface has been impregnated with pigment, carved, and coated in polyester resin. Plywood was used only during the detailing process of the black bone segments and is not visible in the completed artwork. The concrete component for this artwork is not visible but rather serves as a structural aid, anchoring and securing the individual benches into the ground. A standard [[ready-mix concrete]] was used for this application.

The skeleton is positioned with its arms spread out horizontally while the legs point straight down.  The individual benches range in both length and width, but all are approximately 26'' in height.  The artwork was fabricated in Atelier Van Lieshout's studio in [[Rotterdam]] and shipped to the Indianapolis Museum of Art where it was installed by the design and installation crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funky Bones|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/100acres/artists/ateliervanlieshout|accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical information==
''Funky Bones'' was installed at the Indianapolis Museum of Art in May 2010 and is currently on temporary loan.&lt;ref name="Sheets"/&gt; The artwork arose from many disparate interests of Joep van Lieshout, the founder and head designer of AVL. These include [[human anatomy]] &lt;ref name="Schengen"&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Acres Sculpture Park in Indianapolis|publisher=Schengen Visas Organization|url=http://www.schengenvisas.org/2011/07/100-acres-sculpture-park-in-indianapolis/|accessdate=28 Aug 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331185139/http://www.schengenvisas.org/2011/07/100-acres-sculpture-park-in-indianapolis/|archivedate=2012-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the history of the site. Concerning the original concept and inspiration behind ''Funky Bones'', Joep van Lieshout stated:

{{quote|I came up with [this] design that is not only a site specific artwork referring to the history of the continent, but also provides a function and will improve the stay of the park's visitors.  Even as a child I knew the state Indiana and Indianapolis as an exotic place where the 'Indians' came from and were living, and even though this is not true, it is important for my proposition.  Another field of interest is the history of art and especially in early developments of art from primitive and native cultures.  In early art forms, techniques and skills were not so developed and the artworks were made in a very basic way, therefore art had a direct relation to the people, its time and environment.  Native American art, design, and architecture produced beautiful artifacts, religion, and lifestyle, but after the appearance of the 'more advanced' culture from the east the original inhabitants were moved around and dispersed.  The very few things that remained are their cultural heritage and artifacts scattered around.  At this time of rapid production and consumption, their primitive lifestyle, close to nature, seems to become a necessary utopia.  The dislocated Funky Bone benches installed in the park stand symbolic for the leftovers of their sold culture and the spread of Native Americans over the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=Nicole|author2=Richard McCoy|title=The Outdoor Sculptures of 100 Acres: A Report for the Objects and Variable Art Laboratory at the Indianapolis Museum of Art|journal=Indianapolis Museum of Art|year=2011|location=Indianapolis, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition to resonating with the location's history, ''Funky Bones'' also has the functional purpose of providing an ideal spot for visitors to sit, [[picnic]], lounge, or climb.&lt;ref name="Sheets"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheets|first=Hilarie M.|title=100 Acres to Roam, No Restrictions|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/arts/design/13park.html|accessdate=2011-08-28|date=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joep van Lieshout observed visitors sitting on rocks during visits to the site, and decided to provide them with more comfortable seating arrangements in order to facilitate interaction, both among viewers as well as between viewer and art.&lt;ref name="fact sheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Funky Bones, Atelier Van Lieshout|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|url=http://www.resnicowschroeder.com/rsa/upload/PM/493_Filename_Art%20Nature%20Park%20Fact%20Sheet_Atelier%20Van%20Leishout.pdf|accessdate=25 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This degree of interactivity, and even fun, makes ''Funky Bones'' extremely child-friendly.&lt;ref name="Wiltrout"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wiltrout|first=Nicole|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art's 100 Acres|publisher=Indiana Insider|date=19 Jul 2011|url=http://www.in.gov/visitindiana/blog/index.php/2011/07/19/indianapolis-museum-of-arts-100-acres/|accessdate=5 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist==
Atelier Van Lieshout (AVL) is a multidisciplinary company that operates internationally in the field of contemporary art, design, and architecture.  Joep van Lieshout (born 1963), founder of AVL, is a Dutch artist born in Ravenstein, The Netherlands.  He received his formal education and training from the Academy of Modern Art in Rotterdam (1980–1985), [[Ateliers '63]] in Haarlem (1985-1987), and from the [[Villa Arson]] in Nice, France (1987).  Joep van Lieshout formed the AVL studio group in 1995 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, where the company continues to design and fabricate their widely exhibited works.  Atelier Van Lieshout has attained international recognition for objects-based projects that balance on the boundary between art, architecture and design.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}  Recurring themes in the work of AVL include self-sufficiency, power, politics, and the more classical themes of life and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atelier Van Lieshout webpage|publisher=Atelier Van Lieshout|url=http://www.ateliervanlieshout.com/|accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name Atelier Van Lieshout emphasizes the fact that, although Joep van Lieshout founded and leads the collective, the work produced stems from the creative impulses of the entire team.&lt;ref name="Benda"&gt;{{cite web|title=Atelier Van Lieshout|publisher=Friedman Benda|url=http://www.friedmanbenda.com/artists/atelier-van-lieshout/bio/|accessdate=28 Aug 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127053738/http://www.friedmanbenda.com/artists/atelier-van-lieshout/bio/|archivedate=2011-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''Funky Bones,'' AVL's most relevant recurring themes are domestication, politics, complex functioning systems, and the re-contextualization of familiar, domestic objects.  The Atelier van Lieshout claims to make no distinction between "real artworks" and "just building something for someone."&lt;ref name="Dellinger"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dellinger|first=Jade|author2=Hester Schaaf|title=FAQ's about the Atelier Van Lieshout|journal=REVEALED!!! STAFF TELLS ALL ...|year=1998|pages=31|publisher=Nicoline Gatehouse|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The studio group focuses on creating artworks whose design principles challenge conventional ideas of utility and functionality by reinventing how the viewer perceives or approaches an object and the environment in which it is placed.  This is achieved by the implementation of  non-traditional materials and color palettes, odd or unusual subject matter, and through the strategic positioning or locale of the artwork.&lt;ref name="Dellinger"/&gt; ''Funky Bones'' is impossible to see in its entirety except at a distance, preferably from above. Moving close enough to actually interact with it produces an entirely different perspective.&lt;ref name="Schengen"/&gt;

==Condition==
In general, the bones require regular cleaning in order to maintain their white color. Instrumental analysis involving the artwork's color and gloss levels has been recorded for future reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peters|first=Nicole|title=Art, Color, and Gloss|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/blog/2011/07/13/art-color-and-gloss/|accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the book ''[[The Fault in Our Stars]]'', by Indianapolis-based author [[John Green (author)|John Green]], the sculpture is the location of a romantic picnic, having been picked by one of the characters as being the most Dutch place in Indianapolis. ''Funky Bones'' was recreated in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] for the film adaptation of ''The Fault in Our Stars''. The recreation was built by set designers, with help from the artist and Sarah Urist Green, wife of John Green, and former Curator of Contemporary Art at the Indianapolis Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=John|title=Question Tuesday: The Fault in Our Stars Movie Edition|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_731GRjCCI|work=vlogbrothers YouTube Channel|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5693">'''Great Celebrations square''' is the main square for public celebrations in [[Baghdad]] with a [[stadium]] for the heads of the state in the center of the Parade avenue. The square is home to three important public monuments created by leading mid-20th century sculptors. 

==Description==
In 1986 (two years before the war's end) the Iraqi Ba'athist government began construction of a festival and parade ground in Zawra Park, near the extensive presidential complex in the center of Baghdad. 
The square is located near the Harthiya and in the fortified [[Green Zone]], and the site was specifically selected for its symbolic value. Iraqis generally believe it is the same location where the Muslim Arabs defeated the [[Persia]]ns in 636 CE and this historic event is seen to be the beginning of Islamic domination of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalilm S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' pp 10-12&lt;/ref&gt; The site was intended to become the place where military parades and national events would be held. Known as ''Grand Festivities Square'', it comprised a large parade ground, an extensive review pavilion and a large reflecting pool. The surrounding grassy areas hosted Iraqis during military parades. Adding to the festive appeal of the grounds were three refreshments booths that sold ice cream, cold beverages, and candy.

The then leader of Iraq, Saddam Hussein commissioned three major public artworks for the area. These artworks were to be memorials to Iraq's fallen soldiers, a remembrance of Iraq's pain and suffering as a consequence of the Iran-Iraq war and symbols of Iraq's victory in the war. The ''Monument to the Unknown Soldier,'' based on a concept by Iraqi sculptor, [[Khaled al-Rahal]], and situated just beyond the perimeter of the Square, had already opened in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S., ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,'' Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Another major work, the colossal, ''[[Al-Shaheed Monument]]'' designed by Iraqi sculptor, [[Ismail Fatah Al Turk]], and situated on the river bank had been inaugurated in 1983. Hussein commissioned a third monument, the ''[[Victory Arch]]es,'' another concept by the sculptor, Khaled Al-Rahal, to be built in the same vicinity and it was inaugurated in 1989. 

The Victory Arches mark the entrances to the Square. On the day the Arches were dedicated (8 August, 1989), Saddam rode under the arches astride a white horse. &lt;ref&gt;Marozzi, J., ''Baghdad: City of Peace, City of Blood,'' Penguin UK, 2014, [E-book edition], n.p. &lt;/ref&gt; It is generally acknowledged that Hussein intended to cast an allusion to the slain Shiite martyr [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]], killed in [[Karbala]] in 680 [[Anno Domini|CE]], whose death caused the rift between Shiite and Sunni Muslims. The monument, although presenting a triumphalist narrative in relation to the Iran-Iraq war, has assumed a broader symbolism and represents those Iraqis who fell in any war throughout the country's history.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalilm S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' pp 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The three monuments  in the vicinity of the square form a visual and symbolic unit.&lt;ref&gt;Makiya, K. and Al-Khalilm S., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Saddam Hussein's Iraq,'' p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the three artworks was part of a broader Ba'athist government program to beautify Baghdad, instil a sense of national pride, and at the same time immortalise Sadam Hussein's reputation as a powerful leader. &lt;ref&gt;Brown, B.A. and Feldman, M.H. (eds), ''Critical Approaches to Ancient Near Eastern Art,''Walter de Gruyter, 2014 p.xix&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent Developments==

The Square has become a place for public demonstrations and protests.

'''Hall of Femmes''' is a project, based in [[Sweden]], aiming to highlight the work of women in [[art direction]] and [[design]]. The designers Samira Bouabana and Angela Tillman Sperandio founded the project in 2009 and the intention was to revise the design history by talking about and paying tribute to the women who were involved in it. The business includes the Hall of Femmes book series where eight female pioneers in [[graphic design]] are portrayed. The project also includes [[seminars]], [[Film screening|screenings]], talks, [[exhibition]]s and [[podcast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://halloffemmes.com/about/|title=Hall of Femmes - About |publisher=Hall of Femmes |date=2010-10-16 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hall of Femmes also wants to inspire to a more equal industry and contribute to the future of the design scene. The business is widely established both in Sweden and internationally, and has been written up in magazines like [[the New York Times Magazine]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/06/25/fashion/20100627-pulse-slideshow-4.html?_r=0|title=New York Times Magazine on Hall of Femmes |publisher=New York Times Magazine|date=2010-06-25 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Creative Review]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.halloffemmes.com/2013/04/CR.pdf|title=Creative Review on Hall of Femmes |publisher=Hall of Femmes |date=2013-04-01 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/06/art-director-ruth-ansel-slide-show-201006#/slide=16|title=Vanity Fair on Hall of Femmes|publisher=Vanity Fair|date=2010-06-18 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013 Hall of Femmes organized Design Talks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernamuseet.se/en/Stockholm/Programme/Past-programme/2013/Hall-of-Femmes-Design-Talks/|title=Museum of Modern Art on Design Talks|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art, Stockholm|date=2013-05-01|accessdate=2014-03-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413141731/http://www.modernamuseet.se/en/Stockholm/Programme/Past-programme/2013/Hall-of-Femmes-Design-Talks/|archivedate=2014-04-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a two-day conference at the Museum of Modern Art in Stockholm, where top names in the world of design, fashion, art, communication and architecture were invited to talk. Amongst the international speakers were [[Ruth Ansel]], [[Barbara Kruger]], [[Janet Froelich]] and [[Cindy Gallop]].

In 2013, Hall of Femmes received the Bengt Hanser Award, presented by the Swedish Association of Communication Agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.komm.se/fakta2/bengt-hanser-stipendiet|title=Komm on the Bengt Hanser Award|publisher=Komm|date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5295">'''InterAccess''' is a Canadian [[artist-run centre]] and electronic media production facility in [[Toronto]]. Founded in 1982 as Toronto Community Videotex, InterAccess is [[Ontario|Ontario's]] only exhibition space devoted exclusively to technological [[media arts]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interaccess.org/about/history.php&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre for Contemporary Canadian Art places the founding of InterAccess as a key moment in both the history of Canadian electronic art but also within a timeline of developments in international art, science, technology and culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccca.ca/circuit4/timeline.html?languagePref=fr&amp; Centre for Contemporary Canadian Art "Timeline of Digital Art"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1983, InterAccess was incorporated as a not-for-profit, [[Not-for-profit arts organization|artist-run access centre]], under the name [[Videotex|Toronto Community Videotex (TCV)]]. It provided artists access to the [[Telidon]] system, a precursor of the [[World Wide Web]]. The early conception of electronic art placed the organization within the production cooperative system in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, "Cultural Democracy and Institutional Difference", p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; TCV's members created artworks which fell within the more [[systems art|systems-based]] notions of art production, rather than the [[Fine arts|beaux-arts]]&lt;ref&gt;Dowler, "Interstitial Aesthetics and the Politics of Video at the Canada Council", pp. 35-6&lt;/ref&gt; aesthetic of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Hough, "Beyond the Gallery (Electronic Mail Art)", p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  The name change to InterAccess in 1987 reflected a new focus on [[Macintosh]] graphics, [[multimedia]] production and a dial-up artists’ network (much like a [[Bulletin Board System]], or BBS) known as Matrix.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, "The Matrix Artists' Network: An Electronic Community", pp. 230-31&lt;/ref&gt;

InterAccess moved to a larger facility in 1995 allowing InterAccess to offer a gallery and production space that expanded its activities beyond simply access to multimedia production. The exhibitions began to emphasize the finished production and there was a particular focus on establishing an international presence for the centre.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, "Radio Art in a Gallery?", p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition ''Pandoras Box'', a collaboration between InterAccess and Fylkingen New Music and Intermedia Art in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] in 2000, was billed as "the first international interactive encounter with art using remotely controlled robots."&lt;ref&gt;Herst, "The Disembodied Eye", p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, InterAccess moved to a renovated two-floor, three thousand square feet stand-alone building, allowing for more production space, a surround sound studio and a machine shop for constructing large-scale physical computing projects and installation.

The exhibition ''This must be the place: Vera Frenkel, [[David Rokeby]], [[Nell Tenhaaf]] and [[Norman White]]'' was a reconsideration of the centre and as well the place of electronic art within art history.&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, ''This must be the place'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The four featured artists are pioneers in electronic and interactive art and have a history with InterAccess as both members and exhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, ''This must be the place'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, InterAccess received a [[Canada Council]] Media Arts Commissioning Grant for ''The Networked City'', a series of five outdoor interactive installations on [[Yonge Street]] in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interaccess.org/exhibitions/index.php?id=55 The Networked City&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inwangjesaekdo''' ("Clearing After Rain in Mt. Inwangsan" or "After Rain at Mt. Inwang") is a landscape painting by the famous [[Jeong Seon]]. It was painted during the reign of [[Joseon Dynasty]] [[Yeongjo of Joseon|King Yeongjo]] in 1751, at his birthplace in [[Cheongun-dong]] at [[Jongno District]], modern-day [[Seoul]].  It was designated by the South Korean government as the 216th [[National treasures of Korea|National Treasure of Korea]] on August 6, 1984.  The painting is currently held and managed by the [[Ho-Am Art Museum]] in [[Yongin]], [[Gyeonggi-do|Gyeonggi Province]] and is owned by [[Lee Kun-hee]].

'''Left-right asymmetry''' (LR asymmetry) refers to differences in structure ([[Symmetry in biology|symmetry]] breaking) across the mediolateral (left and right) plane in animals. This plane is defined with respect to the [[Anatomical terms of location|anteroposterior]] and [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsoventral]] axes and is perpendicular to both. Because the left-right plane is not strictly an axis (as it is not established through a [[morphogen]] gradient), to create asymmetry, the left and right sides need to be patterned separately.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, A. R. (2004). Symmetry breaking and the evolution of development. ''Science'', ''306''(5697), 828-833&lt;/ref&gt;

LR asymmetry is pervasive throughout [[Animal|metazoans]] and present throughout every major lineage. Notable examples include the large and small claws of the [[fiddler crab]], the left offset of the vertebrate heart, asymmetrical gut coiling in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]],'' and dextral (clockwise) and sinistral (counterclockwise) coiling of [[Gastropoda|gastropods]]. This asymmetry can be restricted to a specific organ or feature, as in the crab claws, or be expressed throughout the entire body as in snails.

== Developmental basis ==
Components of the [[Nodal signaling pathway]] have been implicated in left-right determination in a diverse set of taxa.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Levin et al. (1995). A molecular pathway determining left-right asymmetry in chick embryogenesis. ''Cell'' 82, 803-814.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Coutelis, J. B., González‐Morales, N., Géminard, C., &amp; Noselli, S. (2014). Diversity and convergence in the mechanisms establishing L/R asymmetry in metazoa. ''EMBO Reports'', e201438972.&lt;/ref&gt; While the mechanisms to set up the left-right sides appear to differ markedly among groups of organisms, ''[[NODAL|Nodal]]'' is consistently deployed in most of the lineages that have been examined (except for [[ecdysozoa]]ns).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In established model organisms such as mouse, chick, ''D. melanogaster,'' and ''[[African clawed frog|Xenopus]],'' ongoing research has begun to focus on cellular level symmetry-breaking mechanisms (e.g. cytoskeletal chirality, ciliary flow) that may lead to differential expression of molecules such as Nodal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tee|first=Yee Han|last2=Shemesh|first2=Tom|last3=Thiagarajan|first3=Visalatchi|last4=Hariadi|first4=Rizal Fajar|last5=Anderson|first5=Karen L.|last6=Page|first6=Christopher|last7=Volkmann|first7=Niels|last8=Hanein|first8=Dorit|last9=Sivaramakrishnan|first9=Sivaraj|title=Cellular chirality arising from the self-organization of the actin cytoskeleton|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncb3137|journal=Nature Cell Biology|volume=17|issue=4|pages=445–457|doi=10.1038/ncb3137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vertebrates ===
''Nodal'' was first described in the chick embryo, where genes ''activin receptor IIa, [[Sonic hedgehog]] (Shh),'' and ''chick nodal-related 1 (cNR-1)'' were found to be asymmetrically expressed across [[Primitive knot|Hensen’s node]] with ''cnR-1'' expressed on the left side.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Misexpressing ''Shh'' or ''activin receptor IIa'' on the right side randomized heart asymmetry in the chick. This asymmetrical gene expression appears to be triggered by cell movements in the node.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gros|first=Jerome|last2=Feistel|first2=Kerstin|last3=Viebahn|first3=Christoph|last4=Blum|first4=Martin|last5=Tabin|first5=Clifford J.|date=2009-05-15|title=Cell Movements at Hensen’s Node Establish Left/Right Asymmetric Gene Expression in the Chick|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/324/5929/941|journal=Science|volume=324|issue=5929|pages=941–944|doi=10.1126/science.1172478|issn=0036-8075|pmc=2993078|pmid=19359542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mouse, the left side is distinguished from the right through Nodal flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nonaka|first=Shigenori|last2=Tanaka|first2=Yosuke|last3=Okada|first3=Yasushi|last4=Takeda|first4=Sen|last5=Harada|first5=Akihiro|last6=Kanai|first6=Yoshimitsu|last7=Kido|first7=Mizuho|last8=Hirokawa|first8=Nobutaka|title=Randomization of Left–Right Asymmetry due to Loss of Nodal Cilia Generating Leftward Flow of Extraembryonic Fluid in Mice Lacking KIF3B Motor Protein|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81705-5|journal=Cell|volume=95|issue=6|pages=829–837|doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81705-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally described from ''inversus viscerum (iv)'' and ''inversion of embryonic turning (inv)'' mouse mutants, which are characterized by a randomization of left-right phenotypes, Nodal flow refers to the movement of nodal cilia to create a leftward flow of extraembryonic fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Okada|first=Yasushi|last2=Nonaka|first2=Shigenori|last3=Tanaka|first3=Yosuke|last4=Saijoh|first4=Yukio|last5=Hamada|first5=Hiroshi|last6=Hirokawa|first6=Nobutaka|date=1999-10-01|title=Abnormal Nodal Flow Precedes Situs Inversus in iv and inv mice|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276500801975|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=4|issue=4|pages=459–468|doi=10.1016/S1097-2765(00)80197-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carried in this leftward movement is Nodal, a signaling peptide from the [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGF-β]] family necessary to pattern left-right determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Jane|last2=Norris|first2=Dominic P.|last3=Robertson|first3=Elizabeth J.|date=2002-09-15|title=Nodal activity in the node governs left-right asymmetry|url=http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/16/18/2339|journal=Genes &amp; Development|volume=16|issue=18|pages=2339–2344|doi=10.1101/gad.1016202|issn=0890-9369|pmc=187443|pmid=12231623}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lateral plate mesoderm, Nodal then activates a positive feedback loop promoting its expression and its downstream effector ''[[PITX2|Pitx2]].''

Because Nodal flow through ciliary movement is not present in all vertebrates (e.g. the chick), asymmetric gene expression must be established in another way. One such idea posits that [[ion channel]]s and pumps (H+/K+ ATPase) generate differences in voltage and pH across the mediolateral plane, thus providing gradients to orient signaling molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levin|first=Michael|last2=Thorlin|first2=Thorleif|last3=Robinson|first3=Kenneth R.|last4=Nogi|first4=Taisaku|last5=Mercola|first5=Mark|date=2002-10-04|title=Asymmetries in H+/K+-ATPase and Cell Membrane Potentials Comprise a Very Early Step in Left-Right Patterning|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286740200939X|journal=Cell|volume=111|issue=1|pages=77–89|doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00939-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-vertebrate deuterostomes ===
Recently, work has shown that the Nodal-Pitx2 pathway is present and functional in the non-vertebrate [[deuterostome]]s (tunicates, sea urchins).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shimeld|first=Sebastian M.|last2=Levin|first2=Michael|date=2006-06-01|title=Evidence for the regulation of left-right asymmetry in Ciona intestinalis by ion flux|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dvdy.20792/abstract|journal=Developmental Dynamics|volume=235|issue=6|pages=1543–1553|doi=10.1002/dvdy.20792|issn=1097-0177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molina|first=M Dolores|last2=de Crozé|first2=Noémie|last3=Haillot|first3=Emmanuel|last4=Lepage|first4=Thierry|date=2013-08-01|title=Nodal: master and commander of the dorsal–ventral and left–right axes in the sea urchin embryo|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959437X13000646|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development|series=Developmental mechanisms, patterning and evolution|volume=23|issue=4|pages=445–453|doi=10.1016/j.gde.2013.04.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tunicate ([[Ascidiacea|ascidian]]) ''[[Ciona intestinalis]]'' and ''[[Sea pineapple|Halocynthia roretzi]]'', ''Nodal'' is expressed on the left side of the developing embryo and leads to downstream expression of ''Pitx2.'' At earlier stages, similar H+/K+ ATPase ion channels are reported to be necessary for correct left-right patterning.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While the role of cilia here is still unclear, one study observes that large-scale embryonic movements are required for left-right determination in ''H. roretzi,'' and that this movement is possibly achieved through ciliary movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nishide|first=Kazuhiko|last2=Mugitani|first2=Michio|last3=Kumano|first3=Gaku|last4=Nishida|first4=Hiroki|date=2012-04-15|title=Neurula rotation determines left-right asymmetry in ascidian tadpole larvae|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/139/8/1467|journal=Development|volume=139|issue=8|pages=1467–1475|doi=10.1242/dev.076083|issn=0950-1991|pmid=22399684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sea urchin, ''Nodal'' is expressed on the right side of the embryo, in contrast to the tunicate and vertebrate condition on the left side.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Because [[protostome]]s appear to also express ''Nodal'' on their right side instead of the left (discussed below), some have suggested that this lends further evidence for the dorsoventral [[Inversion (evolutionary biology)|inversion]] hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Protostomes ===

==== Ecdysozoa ====
While ''D. melanogaster'' and nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' do show left-right asymmetry, the Nodal signaling pathway itself is absent in Ecdysozoa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Instead, cytoskeletal regulators such as Myo31DF, a type ID unconventional myosin, have been found to control left-right asymmetry in organ systems such as genitalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spéder|first=Pauline|last2=Ádám|first2=Géza|last3=Noselli|first3=Stéphane|date=2006-04-06|title=Type ID unconventional myosin controls left–right asymmetry in Drosophila|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7085/full/nature04623.html|journal=Nature|volume=440|issue=7085|pages=803–807|doi=10.1038/nature04623|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lophotrochozoa ====
Unlike in Ecdysozoa, the Nodal-Pitx2 pathways have been identified in many lineages within the [[Lophotrochozoa]]ns.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martín-Durán|first=José M.|last2=Vellutini|first2=Bruno C.|last3=Hejnol|first3=Andreas|date=2016-12-19|title=Embryonic chirality and the evolution of spiralian left–right asymmetries|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/1710/20150411|journal=Phil.

== Whole body left-right asymmetry in gastropods ==
Whole body inversion is observed as chiral (dextral, sinistral) coiling in gastropods. While dextral coiling is the most common as it appears in 90-99% of living species, sinistral species still have arisen many times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asami|first=Takahiro|last2=Cowie|first2=Robert H.|last3=Ohbayashi|first3=Kako|date=1998-01-01|title=Evolution of Mirror Images by Sexually Asymmetric Mating Behavior in Hermaphroditic Snails|jstor=10.1086/286163|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=152|issue=2|pages=225–236|doi=10.1086/286163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Developmental basis of shell coiling ===
Gastropods undergo [[Cleavage (embryo)|spiral cleavage]], a feature commonly seen in lophotrochozoans. As the embryo divides, quartets of cells are oriented at angles to each other. In the snail ''Lymnaea stagnalis'', the direction of rotation during the first cell division signals whether the adult will show dextral or sinistral coiling,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meshcheryakov|first=V.

Several studies have begun to investigate the molecular basis of this inheritance.

(2016) did not find asymmetrically expressed ''Lsdia2'' as was seen in the Davison et al. (2016) study.

[[Image:Momotaro2.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Bisque (pottery)|bisque]] doll of Momotarō]]
{{Nihongo|'''Momotarō'''|桃太郎||"Peach Boy"}} is a popular hero of [[Japanese folklore]] originating from [[Okayama Prefecture]]. His name translates as ''Peach [[Tarō (given name)|Tarō]]'', a common Japanese masculine name, and is often translated as ''Peach Boy''. ''Momotarō'' is the title of various books, films and other works that portray the tale of this hero.

==Story==
[[File:Japanese Fairy Book - Ozaki - 247.png|thumb|left|Momotarō coming out of a peach]]
According to the present form of the tale (dating to the [[Edo period]]), Momotarō came to Earth inside a giant peach which was found floating down a river, by an old, childless woman who was washing clothes there. The woman and her husband discovered the child when they tried to open the peach to eat it. The child explained that he had been sent by Heaven to be their son. The couple named him Momotarō, from ''momo'' (peach) and ''tarō'' (eldest son in the family).&lt;ref name=Ozaki&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Japanese Fairy Book |chapter=Momotaro, or the story of the Son of a Peach |last=Ozaki |first=Yei Theodora |year=1903 |publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; Co. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V_RyPbadxJgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, Momotarō left his parents to fight a band of marauding ''[[Oni]]'' (demons or ogres) on a distant island. En route, Momotarō met and befriended a talking dog, monkey and pheasant, who agreed to help him in his quest. At the island, Momotarō and his animal friends penetrated the demons' fort and beat the band of demons into surrendering. Momotarō and his new friends returned home with the demons' plundered treasure and the demon chief as a captive. Momotarō and his family lived comfortably from then on.&lt;ref name=Ozaki/&gt;

[[File:Momotaro Hasegawa cover 1886.jpg|thumb|1885 English ''Momotaro'' published by [[Hasegawa Takejirō]]]]
Momotarō is strongly associated with [[Okayama]], and his tale may have its origins there. The demon island ({{Nihongo|Onigashima|鬼ヶ島}}) of the story is sometimes associated with [[Megijima]] Island, an island in the [[Seto Inland Sea]] near [[Takamatsu, Kagawa|Takamatsu]], due to the vast manmade caves found on that island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city.takamatsu.kagawa.jp/english/kankou/B1e.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110004627/http://www.city.takamatsu.kagawa.jp/english/kankou/B1e.html |archivedate=2008-01-10 |title=Oni-ga-shima(or Megijima) |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Megi-jima/Ogi-jima |url=http://www.city.takamatsu.kagawa.jp/english/sightseeing/spot/megi-jimaogi-jima.html |website=Takamatsu City Web Site |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
The story has some regional variations. Some say Momotarō floated by in a box, a white peach or a red peach. Stories from the [[Shikoku]] and [[Chūgoku region|Chūgoku]] regions muddy the distinction with characters from another folk story, the [[The Crab and the Monkey|Monkey-Crab Battle]], that Momotarō took with him allies to Oni Island, namely a {{Nihongo|bee|蜂|hachi}}, a {{Nihongo|crab|蟹|kani}}, a {{Nihongo|[[millstone]]|臼|usu}}, a {{Nihongo|chestnut|栗|kuri}}, and {{Nihongo|[[cow dung]]|牛の糞|ushi no kuso}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f49m24.niknak.ne.jp/~kire/sub1-21.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208142021/http://www.f49m24.niknak.ne.jp/~kire/sub1-21.htm |archivedate=2008-02-08 |title=桃太郎 |accessdate=2010-09-01 }} (Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are variances about the Momotarō's process of growth; one is that he grew up to meet the expectation of the old couple to be a fine boy. Another is that he grew up to be a strong but lazy person who just sleeps all day and does not do anything. It is possible that the Momotarō being a fine boy version is more famous to give lessons to children. Nowadays, Momotarō is one of the most famous characters in Japan, as an ideal model for young kids for his kind-heartedness, bravery, power, and care for his parents.

Grown up, Momotarō goes on his journey to defeat the demons when he hears about the demons of the Onigashima (demon island). In some versions of the story, Momotarō volunteered to go help the people by repelling the demons, but in some stories he was forced by the townspeople or others to go on journey. However, all the stories describe Momotarō defeating the Oni and live happily ever after with the old couple.

==English translations==
The story has been translated into English many times. "The Adventures of Little Peachling" appeared in [[A.B. Mitford]]'s ''[[Tales of Old Japan]]'' in 1871. Rev. David Thomson's translation as "Little Peachling" appeared as the first volume of [[Hasegawa Takejirō]]'s ''Japanese Fairy Tale'' series in 1885. Susan Ballard included it in ''Fairy Tales from Far Japan'' (1899). [[Yei Theodora Ozaki]] included it in her ''Japanese Fairy Tales'' (1911). Teresa Peirce Williston included it in ''Japanese Fairy Tales'', Second Series, in 1911. And there are many other translations.

The popular children's song about Momotarō titled ''Momotarō-san no Uta'' (''Momotarō's Song'') was first published in 1911; the text's author is unattributed, while the melody was written by [[Teiichi Okano]].  The first two stanzas, with romanization and translation, are given below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d-score.com/ar/A02011408.html|title=d-score 楽譜 - 桃太郎　----　文部省唱歌／岡野貞一|author=|date=|website=www.d-score.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
Momotarō was an immensely popular figure in Japan during World War II, appearing in many wartime films and cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;[[John W. Dower]], ''War Without Mercy: Race &amp; Power in the Pacific War'' p. 253 {{ISBN|0-394-50030-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Momotarō represented the Japanese government, citizens were animals and the United States was the oni, the demonic figure. Even though it is not directly mentioned, it is implied that Onigashima was Pearl Harbor. It was used to convey the idea that Japan would fight against the wicked, yet powerful United States and victory could only be achieved if the citizens supported the government. Also, the food and treasure that Momotarō and the animals earned after conquering the oni was supposed to reflect the glory that the powerful Japanese Empire would have had after defeating the United States. One such movie was ''[[Momotarō: Umi no Shinpei|Momotarō's Divine Sea Warriors]]''.

The '''Multiverse''' is the [[shared fictional universe]] depicted on ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' cards, novels, comics, and other supplemental products.&lt;ref&gt;http://epicstream.com/news/Magic-The-Gathering-Finally-Meets-Dungeons--Dragons-For-The-Ultimate-Fantasy-RPG&lt;/ref&gt; Though ''Magic'' is a strategy game, an intricate storyline underlies the cards released in each expansion.  On the cards, elements of this [[multiverse]] are shown in the card art and through quotations and descriptions on the bottom of most cards (called [[flavor text]]). Novels and anthologies published by [[HarperPrism]] and [[Wizards of the Coast]] (WOTC), and the [[comic book]]s published by [[Valiant Comics|Armada Comics]] expand upon the settings and characters hinted at on the cards. WOTC also publishes a weekly story (most often related to the plane explored in the current expansion set) in the Magic Fiction column, previously known as Official Magic Fiction and Uncharted Realms.

In the early days of the game, the name 'Dominia' was used to describe the story universe but, due to confusion with the name of the plane/planet where the central events of ''Magic'' occur ([[#Dominaria|Dominaria]]), it fell into disuse and was replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dommermuth|first=Brady|title=Ask Wizards - February, 2007|url=http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ask-wizards-february-2007-2007-02-01|work=Daily MTG|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cosmology==
The Multiverse is a collection of planes (described somewhat like [[pocket universe]]s) which are usually named after the primary planet contained within them. Travel between these planes is possible, and powerful beings known as Planeswalkers are capable of traversing between them.&lt;ref&gt;https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/you-are-planeswalker-2008-07-25&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Blind Eternities===

The Blind Eternities is the term more commonly used to describe the space between the planes of reality. Filled with chaotic, raw energies such as Aether, Mana and temporal energy, it is a place where matter and life as known within the planes of reality cannot subsist. (The only exceptions are the Planeswalkers, who briefly pass physically through it when they "walk" between planes.) As such, not much is known or understood about the Blind Eternities. Unfathomable, reality-warping cosmic horrors known as the Eldrazi are said to be born there.

===Aether===

Aether (previously spelled Æther) is the main type of energy filling the blind eternities, although it can also appear in variable quantities within the planes. It is inextricably associated with magic within Magic's [[shared fictional universe]] and the use of the word in several Magic cards implies that casting magic involves channeling and manipulating Aether. Similarly, "summoning" the creatures around which combat and much of gameplay in Magic revolves is described as "pulling (them) from the Aether".

===Dominaria===
The majority of the ''Magic'' story was set on the plane of Dominaria prior to [[Mirrodin]], encompassing long time periods each detailed in certain card sets or books. Dominaria is a unique nexus between all the other planes of the Multiverse.  Occasionally, such as in [[Time Spiral]], the storyline returns to it.

==Storylines==
* '''The Thran''':  The Thran were a race of master artificers who were destroyed by [[Yawgmoth]] and his [[Phyrexians]] (converted Thran following him) during the Thran-Phyrexian War about 5,000 years before the [[Antiquities (Magic: The Gathering)|Brothers]]. They are only hinted at in the game, but [[J. Robert King]]'s novel ''The Thran'' explores their culture in some depth.
* '''[[Antiquities (Magic: The Gathering)|The Brothers' War]]''': War between Urza and Mishra, two brothers who were trained by the archaeologist and artificer Tocasia in creating magical devices based on ancient Thran technology. As their powers grew, so did their enmity, eventually erupting in an all-out war utilizing powerful constructs. Marshalling vast armies aided by their impressive machines (some of the old Thran Empire, some newly made) the brothers staged a series of battles. The war devastated the land of Terisiare on the plane of Dominaria and culminated in a world-devastating climax on the island of Argoth. This caused the Dark, the climate changes which led to the Fall of the Sarpadian Empires and finally to the Ice Age. This story is the basis for the ''Antiquities'' expansion and later the ''Urza's Saga'' Block.
* '''[[The Dark (Magic: The Gathering)|The Dark]]'''  The devastation wrought by the Brothers led to the fall of many civilizations and the beginning of a Dark Age in Dominaria. The destruction of Argoth caused a [[nuclear winter]] that would later lead to the Dominarian Ice Age.  This story is portrayed in the ''Fallen Empires'' and ''The Dark'' expansions. In this age Terisiare's survivors were bitterly opposed to magic. Tiny, insular villages dotted a wasted, goblin-infested landscape. Fanatical priests controlled a few powerful city-states. Preachers and witch-hunters hunted the countryside for the few remaining wizards. Despite this oppression, it is during this era that mortal wizards first discover the five-color nature of magic. This story is fully explained in the novel ''The Gathering Dark'' by Jeff Grubb. The following Ice Age is detailed in ''Eternal Ice'' and ''The Shattered Alliance'', also by Jeff Grubb.
*'''[[Fallen Empires (Magic: The Gathering)|Fallen Empires]]''' The harsh climatic changes that followed the destruction of Argoth caused the southern continent, Sarpadia, to struggle for survival. The elves and humans of Sarpadia begin breeding primitive but adaptable subspecies: saprolings and thrulls, respectively. These creatures soon turn on their creators and terrorize the people of Sarpadia, while the Merfolk suffered an invasion of crustacean-like homarids, which benefitted from the cooling oceans. Barraged by invading orcs, goblins, homarids, thrulls, and even fungus, the civilizations of Sarpadia are destroyed, and the continent falls into darkness.
*'''[[Ice Age (Magic: The Gathering)|The Ice Age]]''':  The climate-altering effects of the devastation continued leading to a global ice age. New empires rose and fought in the cold. Eventually this cooling climate was reversed and life returned to normal.  This story is portrayed in the ''Ice Age'', ''Alliances'', and ''Coldsnap'' expansions, and in the novels ''Eternal Ice'' and ''Shattered Alliance'' by Jeff Grubb. Jeff Grubb also wrote a short story "continuing" the story for ''Coldsnap'', which is located in the Player's Guide insert you can find in a ''Coldsnap'' Fat Pack.
*'''[[Homelands (Magic: The Gathering)|The Homelands]]'''  This short interlude depicts the decimated plane of Ulgrotha, in which many civilizations struggle for power against Baron Sengir, a powerful vampire who has manipulated a number of other characters into serving his ends. The [[planeswalker]]s Serra and Feroz turn the balance in favor of the light, but are killed in battle against a crazed alien planeswalker. The story has no concrete ending.
*'''[[Mirage (Magic: The Gathering)|Jamuraa]]''': The story concerns three of the most powerful nations of [[Jamuraa]] (a tropical continent) — the militaristic kingdom of the Zhalfirins, the religious state of Femeref, and the trading province of the Suq'Ata empire. Zhalfir was the warrior nation, based mainly on red. Femeref was mainly white, and featured clerics and healers, while the seafaring traders of Suq'Ata were mostly blue. Mirage concerned these three nations and their struggle against the evil wizard Kaervek. Kaervek has imprisoned the powerful wizard and diplomat Mangara in an amber prison and the bulk of the story details the Jamuraans attempting to free Mangara. In addition to these events the [[planeswalker]] Teferi has caused his island to disappear from existence for almost 200 years. It is the phasing of the entire island that led Kaervek and Mangara to Jamuraa in the first place.
*'''The Phyrexian Invasion''':  After millennia of peace, the machine-like Phyrexians, who originate on a hellish mechanical world, invade the world of Dominaria led by the former Thran [[Yawgmoth]] from the [[pocket universe]] of Rath. The Phyrexian invasion divides in many sub-stories.
** '''[[Urza block|The Urza Saga]]''': Following the destruction of Argoth, Urza becomes a planeswalker and foresees the invasion of Dominaria. Urza's travels lead the war to the peaceful universe of Serra's realm which is destroyed by Phyrexian armies; survivors of the plane flee to Dominaria and Ulgrotha. In preparation for the invasion, Urza creates the Tolarian academy, a research and development laboratory-school in which he and other mighty wizards train mages for the upcoming invasion and  experiment on weaponry development, time-travel and genetic manipulation in hopes of creating a defensive army. The time experiments lead to a temporal collapse and the academy becomes laced with time fractures, which are both dangerous and useful to the inhabitants. Urza himself develops a fearful Legacy Weapon and Karn, a self-aware golem which, combined, can defeat any foe.  This story arc is linked to The Thran, Antiquities, The Dark, Ice Age and Homelands and is depicted in the books ''The Brothers War'', ''Planeswalker'' and ''Time Streams''.
** '''[[Rath block|The Legacy]]''': This follows the travels of many brave adventurers from all across Dominaria who, aboard Urza's vessel "The Weatherlight", seek to collect the different artifacts left by Urza and necessary to assemble the Legacy Weapon. Opposed to them, many Phyrexian allies or lords will try to stop them from their quest. This story arc is the longest in the Magic continuity, and its characters are depicted in the Weatherlight, Tempest, Stronghold, Exodus, Mercadian Masques, and Nemesis card sets; later, the story continues and concludes in the Invasion arc.
** '''[[Masques block|Prophecy]]''':  Parallel to the "Legacy" history, and following the Mirage and Urza's Saga histories, in Dominaria the warrior kingdom of Keld ensues war all across Jamuraa. Many wizards from the Tolarian academy aid the federation of Jamuraa and succeed in stopping the Keldons' warmongering.
** '''[[Invasion (Magic: The Gathering)|The Invasion]]''': The dreaded Phyrexians finally come to Dominaria across many "planar portals" and Urza, who has been spending thousands of years planning a defense against the Invasion, implements his plans. The Weatherlight leads the Dominarian forces, but the widespread chaos, and the uncompromising nature of Urza's tactics, threaten to destroy the plane. The arrival of Yawgmoth himself leads to the Apocalypse, but he is finally defeated by the fully assembled Legacy Weapon. The Invasion itself occurs in the ''Invasion'' block, but is linked to all previous story arcs. From this point on, the publishers switch to a series of self-contained plotlines with occasional links to older stories, rather than sweeping epics spanning years of card releases.
*'''[[Odyssey (Magic: The Gathering)|Odyssey]]''': One hundred years after the devastation of the Invasion, Dominaria is still in the process of rebuilding. This part of the story takes place in Otaria, a devastated continent that was, surprisingly, the place least affected by the Invasion. It centers on Kamahl, a barbarian, and his quest to get the Mirari, a magical orb of seemingly endless power.
**'''[[Onslaught (Magic: The Gathering)|Onslaught]]''': Having acquired the Mirari with devastating effects, Kamahl renounces it and tries to be rid of it, but the events he triggered have gone far beyond his control. The story shifts to a battle between Akroma, an angel, and Phage, Kamahl's corrupted sister, who kills with a touch. As zealous armies gather behind each of them, Kamahl needs to end their escalating conflict before Otaria itself is decimated. To this end, he recovers the slumbering Mirari and allies himself with three ancient gods who have been waiting for these events to happen again. This story is linked to Mirrodin, and sets the scene for the first major storyline not set on Dominaria.
*'''[[Mirrodin]]''':  The story of Mirrodin takes place on a new, metal world, created by the planeswalker Karn and populated by races stolen from other worlds. Glissa, an elf, and her allies strive to assemble the mythical Kaldra, so that they can defeat the crazed Memnarch, who lives inside the hollow world. All the while, we learn about the history of Mirrodin, and its loose, but nonetheless present, connection to previous storylines based on Dominaria. The Mirrodin story is the first of the new year-long, three-set story arcs, having started in 2003 with the release of ''Moons of Mirrodin'' and continuing with 2004's ''The Darksteel Eye'' and ''The Fifth Dawn''.
*'''[[Kamigawa|The Kami War]]''': The plane of Kamigawa is naturally divided in two: the kakuriyo Kami world (spirit world) and the utsushiyo material world; both working and operating harmoniously until the Kami began to attack the material world twenty years before the story opens. The books follow the lone [[samurai]] Toshiro Umezawa and the princess Michiko as they try to bring peace to Kamigawa. As well as giving the game an unusual, strong Oriental feel, this storyline is interesting in that the designers deliberately tried to give the story a strong influence over the game itself. Instead of relying on the traditional "color wheel" conflict (the game of Magic: the Gathering is based on a five-point circle of allied and enemy color affiliations), the color of any given card may often be less important than whether it has a Kami or Material theme.
*'''[[Ravnica]]''': Ravnica is a plane covered almost entirely in cityscape. The city's ten "guilds", political organizations each based on a different two-color mana pairing, warred for a long period of time. After the conflict, a magical document, the Guildpact, was created to ensure that the plane remained at peace and that the guilds would constrain themselves to their social roles. The main storyline begins 9,999 years later, as anticipation of the decimillennial anniversary builds. The once-noble guilds have corrupted and decayed over time, and a great political gridlock is all that keeps Ravnica stable. A series of protagonists - most notably Agrus Kos, a law enforcement officer from the Boros League, and Teysa Karlov, a lawmage from the Orzhov Syndicate, uncover the plots of the various guildmasters, as well as the ambitions of the "secret guild", House Dimir. The flavor of the cards again exerted considerable influence over the mechanics of the game, encouraging players to build decks devoted to a particular guild.
*'''[[Time Spiral (Magic: The Gathering)|Time Spiral]]''': The Time Spiral block returns to a post-apocalyptic Dominaria. Teferi, a planeswalker, abandoned Urza during the Phyrexian Invasion by "phasing" (temporarily removing from reality) two landmasses known as Shiv and Zhalfir out. He returns to Dominaria to find it in a state of ruin. In addition to having been almost totally devastated by the Apocalypse, mysterious "time rifts" have opened in the skies across the plane, making planeswalking and spellcasting more difficult. Teferi wants to ensure that Zhalfir and Shiv return to Dominaria safely - however, the time rifts, and the considerably deteriorated state of the plane itself, mean that the two continents no longer "fit." Should Zhalfir and Shiv land, Dominaria and the entire Multiverse would be destroyed. The Time Spiral block was billed as Magic's [[nostalgia]] block, and would revisit themes and characters from every storyline up to the end of the Otaria arc. As the Invasion did before, the Time Spiral story is linked to any other story arc before it, harkening back to many earlier settings and characters, even those outside of Dominaria.  It was during this block that The Mending occurred, greatly reducing the powers of all planeswalkers.
*'''[[Lorwyn]]''': Whereas most blocks consist of three sets, it was decided to turn the 2007/08 block into two mini blocks of two sets each. The focus of the first is the plane of Lorwyn, an idyllic, perpetually sunlit world populated by a wide variety of civilized species. These tribes are generally peaceful but keen to keep to themselves. The story centers around an elf outcast named Rhys who has triggered a series of events foreseen by his mentor, Colfenor, and a flamekin pilgrim named Ashling who believes her path and Rhys's are the same. The coming [[Aurora (astronomy)|Aurora]], an annual event when the plane darkens and lights appear in the sky, is the key to whatever it is that Rhys needs to do.
**'''[[Shadowmoor]]''': Rather than passing harmlessly as it normally does, the Aurora instead transforms Lorwyn into an eerie reflection of itself. The idyllic, sunlit world is replaced by the shadows and omnipresent malice of Shadowmoor. Landscapes, races and even individuals become twisted alternatives with no indication that their Lorwyn selves ever existed. Ashling, now known as the Extinguisher, has a central role in this shift, and it falls to Rhys (an elvish hero in this place) and Maralen, a mysterious elf and one of the very few unchanged by the transformation, to discover why.
*'''[[Alara block|Alara]]''': The plane of Alara was shattered long ago by an unknown force; it is now split unequally into five unique shards, each having no knowledge of the others. Each shard was denied two of the five colors of magic by the event (the inhabitants of each shard have had no recollection of the missing two colors of mana for centuries), and have evolved around their remaining three: The militant, feudal, sun-dappled plane of Bant; the scientific, order-obsessed, windy and cloud covered plane of Esper; the desperate, lifeless, blackened plane of Grixis; the violent, harsh, volcanic plane of Jund; and the green, lush, stampeding plane of Naya. Many species die off, evolve, or border extinction in each shard due to insufficient mana sustenance (Zombies can't survive without black mana, angels can't survive without white mana, etc.), and others thrived. The force that shattered the plane is unknown, but believed to be the five-headed hydra Progenitus (for unknown reasons) who disappears at the shattering of the plane and reappears in the expansion "Alara - Conflux" when the shards are reunited.
**'''Conflux''': As the Shards of Alara draw closer together, the millennia-long machinations of a hidden evil come closer to bearing a dire harvest. Nicol Bolas, once one of the most powerful planeswalkers, has been manipulating the civilizations of Alara for his own reasons. As the shards violently collide with each other after centuries apart, war erupts on all sides, and in the chaos, Bolas seeks to harness the power of the Maelstrom, the chaotic center of the plane where all five colors come together in a magical storm of unimaginable energies and power. The planeswalker Elspeth Tirel and the valiant knight Rafiq start to catch wind of an insidious plot and begin investigating.
*'''[[Zendikar]]''': A new plane is introduced: Zendikar, a world with powerful, uncontrollable mana and many dangerous features, including the Roil. Planeswalkers are drawn to Zendikar because of its powerful mana. Many of Zendikar's residents must fight against the land itself as mountains become alive and forests move. It is revealed that thousands of years ago three planeswalkers locked powerful, unstoppable beings known as the Eldrazi in a complex prison on Zendikar, causing the plane's complex problems. When three more planeswalkers enter the prison, the Eldrazi are released and start destroying Zendikar as they cannot escape from the plane.
*'''[[Scars of Mirrodin]]''': As the storyline returns to the metallic plane of Mirrodin, it is found divided.  A corrupted Karn has returned and brought with him the rot of Phyrexia.  As the world faces off, Mirran versus Phyrexian, the idyllic plane is brought to a new form.  This set also marked a deviation from the five color wheel, instead pushing players to align their decks to the Mirran or Phyrexian side of the conflict; to reenforce this, they created a web site devoted to the war where the player can switch between sides. In February 2011, it was announced that Phyrexia had won, and the set New Phyrexia played out as a war amongst five Praetors of Phyrexia, battling each other for dominance.
*'''[[Innistrad]]''': A new plane is introduced: Innistrad, set in a gothic-themed world, where vampires, werewolves, and demons run rampant. Before the events of the block, the human population of Innistrad was constantly beset by supernatural creatures. In response, the planeswalker Sorin created the arch-angel Avacyn to protect the humans. Avacyn set out to eradicate all of Innistrad's demons, leading to an epic battle against the elder demon, Griselbrand. During the battle, Griselbrand was able to trick Avacyn into locking both beings in the magical prison known as the Helvault. With Avacyn gone, the angel's protection disappeared and soon creatures of darkness were free to prey on mankind once more. When Sorin finds out about this he goes straight to Innistrad (presumably from Zendikar) to see what can be done. While he is searching for Avacyn, Liliana Vess is there searching for Griselbrand so she can slay him and release herself from their bargain for Liliana's soul. Liliana discovers the Hellvault and releases Griselbrand and Avacyn. Liliana slays Griselbrand, and Avacyn's restored powers guard humanity from the zombies, werewolves, and dangers of Innistrad.
*'''[[Return to Ravnica]]''': Returning to the megalopolis of Ravnica, the guilds have been in a state of constant warfare ever since the events of Dissension, when the Guildpact was dissolved. The Izzet League's guild leader Niv-Mizzet discovers a maze passing through the Tenth District of the city. He sets his entire guild on figuring out the point of this "Implicit Maze". It is learned later in the story that the being who traverses the maze will become the Ruler of Ravnica. Niv-Mizzet makes an announcement all over the city of Ravnica, asking all guilds to send a champion to run the maze. The planeswalker Jace Beleren solves the mystery of the maze and lauds himself the Living Guildpact, settling disputes for the ten guilds.
*'''[[Theros]]''': On a new plane, Theros, based on the heroes, myths, and monsters of [[Ancient Greece]], Elspeth arrives and is declared the Champion of the sun god, Heliod. The planeswalker Xenagos becomes the God of Revels, angering the established pantheon of the other Gods. Heliod gives Elspeth the Godsend, a sword with which to slay Xenagos. Ajani Goldmane, another planeswalker, helps Elspeth to kill Xenagos. Meanwhile, the planeswalker Kiora is searching the seas of Theros for something that will help to defeat the Eldrazi that will inevitably eventually destroy the Multiverse. The merfolk begin to worship Kiora, mistaking her for Thassa, the God of the Sea. At this point all of the Gods of Theros are very angry at the planeswalkers. After Elspeth kills Xenagos, Heliod takes the Godsend and kills Elspeth with it, sending Elspeth to the underworld of Theros. Ajani is angered and stays on Theros looking for a way to get even with the Gods.
*'''[[Khans of Tarkir]]''': A new plane (Tarkir) is the setting of this block. Tarkir is the homeworld of Sarkhan Vol, a planeswalker known for an obsession with dragons, and the five warring clans, each aligned towards 3 colours. The Mardu (RWB), The Abzan (WBG), The Jeskai (URW), The Sultai (BGU) and the Temur (GUR). All dragons have gone extinct on Tarkir, hunted to extinction by the 5 clans many years ago, but Sarkhan returns to find the source of the voice within his mind. The Planeswalker Sorin also comes to Tarkir where he discovers that Ugin, one of the Planeswalkers that helped to seal the Eldrazi on Zendikar, has died many years ago. Sorin leaves Tarkir saddened by this loss. With the help of the Jeskai leader Narset, Sarkhan makes his way to the resting place of Ugin and travels back in time through the Nexus (the remains of Ugin form this Nexus) but not before he sees Narset killed by Zurgo Helmsmasher, Khan of the Mardu.
**'''[[Fate Reforged]]''': Sarkhan travels through the Nexus 1000 years into the past and discovers the world of Tarkir before the fall of the Dragons. He discovers that the Dragons are formed within great tempests and that these tempests are powered by Ugin himself. He arrives in time to see Ugin confront his nemesis Nicol Bolas, Sarkhan's old master (although at this point in time Nicol Bolas had not met Sarkhan yet). Sarkhan sees Nicol Bolas kill Ugin and leave Tarkir, leaving Sarkhan distraught that he could not save the great Dragon. Using the power of the Hedron he had recovered from Zendikar, Sarkhan encases Ugin within a cocoon of Hedrons and seals him away to save his life. This act changes the future history of Tarkir, as with Ugin still alive the Dragon Tempests would never end, preventing the humans from hunting the Dragons into extinction. Due to his actions changing his own past, Sarkhan is pulled from the past Tarkir and back into the present.
**'''[[Dragons of Tarkir]]''': Sarkhan returns to the present day Tarkir to find the Dragons have survived and now live together with the humans. Although the 5 clans still clash among each other, they are now led by the powerful Dragon Lords instead of the human Khans of Sarkhan's own past. He sees many people he knew from his own timeline, however none of them remember him and all have changed as Sarkhan's actions have influenced this new Tarkir. Sarkhan travels again to the resting place of Ugin and discovers the revived Elder Dragon is gone. He cannot sense Ugin's power in his plane but takes refuge in the fact that Ugin is safe. Sarkhan then goes to find Narset where he discovers his old friend has now left the confines of the Dragons Clans and has learnt the secret history of Tarkir, including the history of Sarkhan himself. We also learn that Narset's spark has ignited and she has become a Planeswalker. We leave the pair on Tarkir, neither of them intending to leave for a long time, with too much to see and learn upon the reinvigorated plane of Tarkir.
*'''[[Battle for Zendikar]]''': The set picks up the storyline of Zendikar where the released Eldrazi devastate the plane. Ulamog, one of the 3 released Eldrazi titans, slowly consumes the land itself. The Zendikari population either flees or unites their strength to fight the Eldrazi together under the leadership of the planeswalker Gideon Jura. Gideon also convinces Jace on Ravnica to help Zendikar. Jace agrees, also since he is partly responsible for releasing the Eldrazi from their prison. He is convinced that the hedrons and leylines of the plane are the key to imprison the Eldrazi once again. The planeswalker Nissa with her unique connection to the plane itself and Kiora, with the weapon she stole from Thassa on Theros join the fight as well. With joint forces the Planeswalker and the Zendikari build a trap of aligned hedrons. For a moment they can imprison Ulamog again, but they were sabotaged by the reignited Demon Planeswalker Ob Nixilis who frees Ulamog, seeking revenge on Nissa and destruction of the plane he despises. He awakens Kozilek as well leaving the Plane with two ravaging Eldazi titans.
*'''[[Shadows over Innistrad]]''': The denizens of Innistrad are beset on all sides.  Their faith in the archangel Avacyn brought them strength when fighting against demons, werewolves, vampires, and all manners of horrors.  But, now the mighty protector of the plane has been twisted into something monstrous by an outside influence.  A very familiar force has stepped into the gothic world, and its corrupting tendrils now touch everything.  The next set, Eldritch Moon, focuses on the fact that Emrakul, the most powerful Eldrazi titan who had been missing from the Battle for Zendikar storyline, is now on Innistrad. Together, the Gatewatch must find a way to save the plane from Emrakul's influence. This story also focuses on cosmic horror instead of the traditional gothic horror of old Innistrad.
*'''[[Kaladesh]]''': The Gatewatch go to Chandra Nalaar's home world, the titular plane of Kaladesh, where she finds her mother (presumed dead) and almost kills Tezzeret. Tezzeret later kidnaps Rashmi, winner of the famous Inventor's Fair, and begins a dastardly plot to control the ruling Consulate. With the Consulate imprisoning inventors and confiscating their devices following the Fair, tensions between the populace and the government reach a boiling point, as depicted in Aether Revolt. The block focuses on a Steampunk aesthetic, with the steam replaced by the powerful material aether.
*'''[[Amonkhet]]''': The Gatewatch set out to destroy the evil dragon planeswalker Nicol Bolas after learning of his dominion over the titular desert plane Amonkhet. In the desert, they find a city (Naktamun) teeming with food, water, and life, ruled by five gods, with Bolas seemingly absent altogether. The people of Naktamun train their entire lives to die in ritual combat, hoping to experience pure bliss in the afterlife when the God-Pharaoh (Bolas) returns to Amonkhet. In Hour of Devastation, Bolas returns as prophesied, only to raze Naktamun and reveal the true purpose of the training and combat: to create an army of physically-perfect and combat-adept mummies to serve as an unquestionably loyal army. The block's setting is based ancient Egypt, with themes of social hierarchy and contrast between life and death.
*'''[[Ixalan]]''': The plane is home to four primary tribes, each with distinct synergies and advantages that draw off of one another.  As for the tale: the golden city of Orazca, bured deep in the jungle, houses a great secret.  The immortal sun, an artifact of immense power, is hidden there.  Now, that secret has become known.  The great forces of the plane gather to combat one another in a contest to see who will claim the mighty prize.  The merfolk River Herals, the vampiric Legion of Dusk, the Brazen Coalition of pirates, and the Sun Empire's dinosaur riders all meet in open conflict to decide the fate of their world.
*'''[[Dominaria]]''': A return to the place of so many of Magic: The Gathering's storylines in celebration of the game's 25th anniversary.

==Additional plots==
There are numerous other smaller plots and subplots that take place in Dominaria and on the many planes of the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]] of '''Dominia''' as well as events after the invasion of Dominaria by the Phyrexians.

* The sets from ''Weatherlight'' up to ''Apocalypse'' follow the epic story arc of the crew of the airship ''Weatherlight'', their trek across several planes, and their ultimate role in defending Dominaria from the Phyrexian invasion.
* The sets from ''Odyssey'' to ''Scourge'', set in the era of upheaval after the Invasion, involve the Dominarian continent of Otaria and the struggle between various factions for the powerful artifact known as the Mirari.
* The sets from ''Mirrodin'' to ''Fifth Dawn'' are set in the world of Mirrodin, where artificial and natural life are inseparably entwined.
* Several [[Magic: The Gathering video games]] have their own storylines and worlds.
* Starting with The Mending during ''Time Spiral'', many of the stories revolve around the newly created, de-powered Planeswalkers. These characters recur in multiple sets, and may receive reprints or entirely new cards in new sets.

'''Nora Barnacle''' (21 March 1884 – 10 April 1951) was the [[Artistic inspiration|muse]] and wife of Irish author [[James Joyce]].

Barnacle and Joyce had their first romantic assignment on a date celebrated worldwide as the ‘Bloomsday’ of his modernist novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', a book that she did not, however, enjoy. Their sexually explicit letters have aroused much curiosity, especially as Joyce normally disapproved of coarse language, and they fetch high prices at auction. 

Barnacle was played by [[Susan Lynch]] in the 1999 bio-pic ''[[Nora (2000 film)|Nora]]''.

==Early life==
{{redirect|Michael Bodkin|the GAA referee|Michael Bodkin (referee)}}
Barnacle was born in [[Galway]] [[workhouse]] on 21 March 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://civilrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/images/birth_returns/births_1884/02698/1993624.pdf|title=General Registrar's Office|website=IrishGenealogy.ie|access-date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her entry in the birth register, which gives her first name as "Norah", is dated 22 March. Her father, Thomas Barnacle, a baker in [[Connemara]], was an illiterate man who was 38 years old when she was born. Her mother, Annie Honoria Healy, was 28 and worked as a dressmaker.

Between 1886 and 1889, Barnacle's parents sent her to live with her maternal grandmother, Catherine Mortimer Healy. During these years, she began studies at a convent, eventually graduating from a national school in 1891. In 1896, Barnacle completed her schooling and began to work as a porteress and laundress. In the same year, her mother threw her father out for drinking and the couple separated. Barnacle went to live with her mother and her uncle, Tom Healy, at 4 Bowling Green, Galway.

In 1896, at age 12, Barnacle fell in love with a teenager named [[Michael Feeney (schoolteacher)|Michael Feeney]], who died soon after of [[typhoid]] and [[pneumonia]]. In a dramatic coincidence, another boy she loved, Michael Bodkin, died in 1900 – causing some of her friends to call her "man-killer." Joyce later based the final short story in ''[[Dubliners]]'', "[[The Dead (short story)|The Dead]]", on these incidents. It was rumoured that she sought comfort from her friend, budding English theatre starlet, Laura London, who introduced her to a Protestant named [[Willie Mulvagh]]. In 1903, she left Galway after her uncle learned of the affair and friendship, and went to [[Dublin]] where she worked as a [[maid|chambermaid]] at Finn's Hotel (later the name of the hotel was used as the title for a posthumously-published collection of ten short narrative pieces written by Joyce, ''[[Finn's Hotel]]'', in 2013).&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/14/james-joyce-collection-published James Joyce's 'last undiscovered' collection to be published | Books | theguardian.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with Joyce==
Barnacle met Joyce on 10 June 1904 while still in Dublin and they had their first romantic liaison on 16 June. Joyce later chose 16 June 1904 as the date for the setting for his novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' and the date has come to be known and celebrated around the world as [[Bloomsday]]. The 1904 rendezvous began a long relationship that eventually led to marriage in 1931&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=James (Augustine Aloysius) Joyce Biography (1882–1941) | url =https://www.biography.com/people/james-joyce-9358676 | accessdate = 8 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued until Joyce's death.

Barnacle's and Joyce's relationship was complex. They had different personalities, tastes and cultural interests. Of their first meeting, she recalled: "I mistook him for a Swedish sailor – His electric blue eyes, yachting cap and [[Plimsoll shoe|plimsolls]]. But when he spoke, well then, I knew him at once for just another Dublin [[jackeen]] chatting up a country girl."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Joyce: a graphic guide|last1=Norris |first1=David |last2=Flint |first2=Carl |publisher=Icon Books Ltd|year=1994|isbn=978-184831-351-4|location=London|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numerous erotic letters they exchanged suggest they loved each other passionately.&lt;ref name="Maddox - Guardian 2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jul/09/books.booksnews|title=Ah yes – but what ever happened to Nora's side of the correspondence?|last=Maddox|first=Brenda|date=8 July 2004|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are also of interest because of Joyce’s lifelong dislike of swearing and crude language.&lt;ref&gt;://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3877209.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce seems to have admired and trusted her, and Barnacle clearly loved Joyce and trusted him enough to agree to leave Ireland with him for the Continent. In anticipation of the move to Paris, she began studying French and Barnacle cooked English puddings at Joyce's request during their travels.

In 1904, Barnacle and Joyce left Ireland for continental Europe and the following year set up house in [[Trieste]] (at that time in [[Austria-Hungary]]). On 27 June 1905, Nora Barnacle gave birth to a son, Giorgio and later to a daughter, [[Lucia Joyce|Lucia]], on 26 July 1907. A miscarriage in 1908 coincided with the beginning of a difficult time for both. Though she remained by his side, and the couple were legally married in London in 1931, she complained to her sister both about his personal qualities and his writings.

In these letters to her sister, she said he drank too much and wasted too much money. As for his literary activity, she lamented that his writings were obscure and lacking in sense. She was always fiercely proud of him, although she occasionally expressed impatience at his meetings with other artists and admitted she would have preferred him had he been a musician—in his youth, he was a talented singer—rather than a writer.

Lucia's mental illness, which became acute in the early 1930s, posed another challenge to the couple's relationship. Nora believed the condition required hospitalisation, which Joyce opposed. They brought in many specialists, and Lucia was for a time the patient of [[Carl Jung]]. She was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]] and admitted to a clinic in 1936. Her father visited her there often, but not her mother. As Nora's biographer Brenda Maddox recorded, 'Lucia was rarely out of Nora's mind. Because she had aroused Lucia's most florid schizophrenic reactions, Nora was not allowed to accompany Joyce on his ritual Sunday afternoon visits to Ivry. Not only did this exclude her from any contact with her daughter, it also required her to spend much of each week arranging for someone to accompany Joyce, who could not easily go alone... Joyce liked to portray himself as safe from Lucia's violence, as if he was the only other permitted inhabitant of her private world. Yet once when Giorgio went with his father, Lucia saw them and cried, 'Che bello! Che bello!' then lunged and tried to strangle them.' As Maddox also noted, 'There is no record that Nora ever saw her daughter again.'{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Later life and death==

After Joyce's death in [[Zurich]] in 1941, Nora decided to remain there. She died in Zurich of [[acute renal failure]] in 1951, at age 67.

==Maddox biography==
{{main|Nora (2000 film)}}

In 1988, Nora Barnacle was the subject of a biography by [[Brenda Maddox]], ''Nora: A Biography of Nora Joyce''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Brenda|last= Maddox|title=Nora: Biography of Nora Joyce|publisher= Hamish Hamilton |year=1988|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QtRaAAAAMAAJ|isbn=9780241123850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This in turn was made into a film in 1999, directed by Pat Murphy and starring [[Susan Lynch]] and [[Ewan McGregor]].

==Auction of letter from Joyce to Nora==
In 2004, an erotic letter from Joyce to Barnacle sold at [[Sotheby's]] for £240,800, a record amount for a modern-day letter at auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Joyce letter smashes sale record | date=8 July 2004 | publisher =BBC News | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3877209.stm | accessdate = 17 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5393">[[File:OHANDA logo.svg|thumbnail| Logo of the Open Hardware and Design Alliance (OHANDA)]]

The '''Open Hardware and Design Alliance''' (OHANDA) aims at encouraging the sharing of open hardware and designs. The core of the project is a free online service where manufacturers of [[Open hardware]] and designs can register their products with a common label. This label maps the four freedoms of [[Free Software]] to physical devices and their documentation. It is similar to a non-registered [[trademark]] for hardware and can be compared to other certificates such as U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) or [[CE mark]]. OHANDA thus has the role of a self-organized registration authority.

== License ==

The Open Hardware and Design Alliance has rewritten the four freedoms of [[free software]] as follows to match them to hardware resp. hardware documentation:

{{Quotation | 
# Freedom 0: The freedom to use the device for any purpose.
# Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the device works and change it to make it to do what you wish. Access to the complete design is precondition to this.
# Freedom 2: Redistribute the device and/or design (remanufacture).
# Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the device and/or design, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits. Access to the complete design is precondition to this.|http://www.ohanda.org}}

The idea to create a label that makes open hardware and designs recognizable is because [[copyright]] and [[copyleft]] are hard to realize in the context of physical devices. Instead of going through the lengthy and expensive process of [[patent]]ing hardware to make it open, hardware developers and designers can put their products under a public domain license by registering them on the OHANDA website. They can license their work under their own names and keep the devices' reuse open.

The procedure is the following: A hardware designer or manufacturer creates an account on the OHANDA website to get a unique producer ID. This account can either be for a person or for an organization. The terms and conditions he accepts to use the label imply that she grants the Four Freedoms to the users. The documentation of the product must be published under a "copyleft" or public domain license. Next, the manufacturer registers the product or design. A unique product ID will be issued. This ID is also referred to as the "OKEY". Now the manufacturer or designer can print or engrave the OHANDA label and the OKEY onto the device. This way, the device always carries the link to the open documentation and to all past contributors. Via the OHANDA website, users can trace back the artefact. At the same time, the label makes the openness of the product visible. Everyone is free to change the device and to share the new design with a new product ID on the website. The development can be seen by following the associations online.&lt;ref&gt;http://opendesignnow.org/index.php/case/ohanda-jurgen-neumann/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The idea of creating a label for open source hardware came up at the GOSH! Summit (Grounding Open Source Hardware) at [[Banff Centre]] in [[Banff, Alberta]] in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.banffcentre.ca/programs/program.aspx?id=888&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the active community members developed the project website&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohanda.org&lt;/ref&gt; where OHANDA-labeled hardware can be registered. OHANDA launched a sticker campaign: The stickers show a crossed out closed box, symbolizing closed "black boxes". The stickers are meant to be put on all sorts of devices to make visible how little open source devices exist.

In 2011, OHANDA community members met at the Piksel11 festival in [[Bergen]]/[[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;http://piksel.no/ocs/index.php/piksel/piksel11/paper/view/777&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, they have been using the term "reables" as a replacement for "Free/Libre Open Source Hardware".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohanda.org/reables&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Some biographers believe Pierrot Barra was born in 1937, while others contend it was 1942; despite the disagreement around the specific date of his birth, it is known for certain that he was born in a district of Port-au-Prince called Bel Air.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His mother, a ''mambo'' or Vodou priestess, made and sold Vodou flags at the Iron Market in Port-au-Prince.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vodou Things: The Art of Pierrot Barra and Marie Cassaise|last=Cosentino|first=Donald|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=1998|isbn=|location=Jackson|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Barra assisted his mother in her work and business for thirty years, and it was from her that he gained the necessary skills to begin making his own art.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

At the age of thirteen, he became an ''oungan'', or Vodou priest.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  He was also a part of the Bizango secret society, reaching one of its highest ranks of president.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hidden Religion: The Greatest Mysteries and Symbols of the world's Religious Beliefs|last=Issitt|first=Micah Lee|last2=Main|first2=Carlyn|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2014|isbn=|location=Santa Barbara, California|pages=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the Bizango society is feared and controversial force among the Haitian people, Barra claimed he was a member for protection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Pierrot Barra and Marie Cassaise, also a Vodou priestess, were married in 1971 and have been creating art together since then.  Together, the two had several children, most notably Roland and Franz, who helped create pieces when Barra’s popularity grew in the late 1990’s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vodou Things: The Art of Pierrot Barra and Marie Cassaise|last=Cosentino|first=Donald|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=1998|isbn=|location=Jackson|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Barra also had between eight and ten other wives as well, with whom he had between twenty and thirty children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vodou Things: The Art of Pierrot Barra and Marie Cassaise|last=Cosentino|first=Donald|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=1998|isbn=|location=Jackson|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Barra died on July 31, 1999 due to heart failure.  His funeral was attended by many, including art historians, customers, and foreigners who admired his work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In his stead, Marie Cassaise and his sons Roland and Franz continue to work in his style.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Works ==
[[File:Collectie Nationaal Museum van Wereldculturen AM-670-7 Paquet Kongo Haiti Pierot Barra (Vervaardiging).jpg|thumb|A [[paquet congo]] created by Pierrot Barra&lt;br&gt;({{ill|National Museum of World Cultures|nl|Nationaal Museum van Wereldculturen}})]]
Pierrot Barra sold his work, what he calls “Vodou Things,” from a stall in the Iron Market in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.  It is unknown whether Barra ever considered his pieces fine art.  While Marie Cassaise is frequently credited with helping him create his work, there is very little written about her or how little or how much she contributed to the process.

Many of Barra’s pieces can be considered ''gads'', very personal items imbued with spiritual power to benefit its owner, or ''reposwa'', items that contains a Haitian Vodou spirit, known as a ''lwa'' or a ''djab'' (devil), instead of altars or altar pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vodou Things: The Art of Pierrot Barra and Marie Cassaise|last=Cosentino|first=Donald|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=1998|isbn=|location=Jackson|pages=23–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like other Haitian Vodou art, Barra’s work is filled with shiny cloth, sequins, symbols associated with the different Haitian spirits or ''lwa'', and imagery from Catholicism.  This is because West African slaves brought to Haiti incorporated Catholicism into their belief system in order to gain understanding and power over their French white masters, creating what is now known as Haitian Vodou.  Sequins and shimmery elements are used because they attract the Vodou lwa, in some cases for preparation for a Vodou ritual or possession (known as “riding”).

The main guiding ''lwa'' of Barra’s life and art, his ''met tet'', are St. Jacques Majeur, Ezili Danto, Ogou Badagri, and Agwe.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vodou Things: The Art of Pierrot Barra and Marie Cassaise|last=Cosentino|first=Donald|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=1998|isbn=|location=Jackson|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his dreams, sometimes these ''lwa'' commanded him to make work and other times he used the dreams for inspiration for pieces.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Sometimes, the ''lwa'' would first appear to him as creatures with a hundred heads, but as he communicated more with them, he claimed they began to look like average people.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vodou Things: The Art of Pierrot Barra and Marie Cassaise|last=Cosentino|first=Donald|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=1998|isbn=|location=Jackson|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these dreams, Barra would also see the customer who would buy the piece; he claimed each piece was for a specific person.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vodou Things: The Art of Pierrot Barra and Marie Cassaise|last=Cosentino|first=Donald|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=1998|isbn=|location=Jackson|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barra’s works rely heavily on accumulation, a technique heavily used in Haitian and Vodou art and brought over from Africa.  The changing nature of the ''lwa'' are why they love so many different kinds of materials and why so many different materials are used for sculptures, altars, and other reverent pieces.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Some of his works contain ''pwen'', or points of spiritual power allowing the spirit world to seep into the world of flesh.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The most iconic part of Barra’s works are the plastic dolls, which some scholars believe is his greatest contribution to Haitian art and sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cosentino|first=Donald|date=November 2011|title=Baby on the Blender: A Visual History of Catastrophe in Haiti|url=|journal=Small Axe|volume=15|pages=141|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These dolls are not like the “voodoo” dolls of New Orleans, nor are they stuck with pins; rather they function as messengers to the spirits, represent humans or ''lwa'', or serve in place of humans for punishment or channeling magic.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  He claimed the materials for his pieces were always brought to him by people through the lwa as described to him in a dream, although some believe he had runners that got the materials for him.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Donald Cosentino coined the term “mojo board” to describe Barra’s work that developed in the middle of his artistic career, which is a sculpture with the pieces affixed to a cloth-covered board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vodou Things: The Art of Pierrot Barra and Marie Cassaise|last=Cosentino|first=Donald|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=1998|isbn=|location=Jackson|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the genre of sculpture for which Barra is most well-known.

Barra’s work has been described as having an Antillean Aesthetic, but also being postmodern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vodou Things: The Art of Pierrot Barra and Marie Cassaise|last=Cosentino|first=Donald|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=1998|isbn=|location=Jackson|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cosentino|first=Donald|date=Spring 1996|title=Lavilokan|url=|journal=African Arts|volume=29|pages=28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His art is not considered traditional (although it contains traditional Vodou elements, such as sequins), but it is easily recognizable by Vodou practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vodou Things: The Art of Pierrot Barra and Marie Cassaise|last=Cosentino|first=Donald|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=1998|isbn=|location=Jackson|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even within the ever-changing culture of Vodou and Vodou art, Barra’s work has been called “revolutionary.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vodou Things: The Art of Pierrot Barra and Marie Cassaise|last=Cosentino|first=Donald|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=1998|isbn=|location=Jackson|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Present in Barra’s work are symbols of the Bizango spirits, a sect of the Vodou ''lwa'' pantheon.

'''''Reel Power: Hollywood Cinema and American Supremacy''''' is a 2010 [[Pluto Press]] book by Matthew Alford, which argues that even many of the most politically critical films, such as ''[[Hotel Rwanda]]'', ''[[Thirteen Days (film)|Thirteen Days]]'' and ''[[Three Kings (1999 film)|Three Kings]]'', provide favourable mythology for the United States' government. Alford draws attention to the power of corporate moguls and the role of the government in the production of various films, such as ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'', ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'', and ''[[Transformers]]''.  The foreword is written by [[Michael Parenti]].  A French translation emerged in August 2018, with a new preface.

== Reception ==
In the British ''[[Morning Star (UK newspaper)|Morning Star]]'', James Walsh commented that the book "is an engaging look at the innards of the dream factory process" and that although the revelations of film-maker collusion with the Pentagon are not surprising "the details are fascinating" especially in relation to "films traditionally considered nuanced or critical of US foreign policy".&lt;ref&gt;James Walsh [http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/index.php/news/content/view/full/97424 Review: ''Reel Power'',] ''Morning Star'', 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]'' called it "One part cultural studies analysis, and another part expose", adding that it "offers a salient critique for those who are concerned about the long term implications of the power of film to act as site of ideological instruction".&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Popular Culture Volume 45, Number 4 (August 2012), p. 908-10&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Sociology called it "an attractive and up-to-date set of tools for the critical literacy that should be mandatory in today’s media-saturated environments".&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary Sociology: A Journal of Reviews July 2011 vol. 40 no. 4 501&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Kinnear from ''[[Total Film]]'' gave ''Reel Power'' four stars out of five and called it a "laudable study" and "an eye opening expose". "Alford's occasionally guilty of straw-clutching", he said, "but you'll watch the next gung-ho blockbuster a little closer".&lt;ref&gt;Simon Kinnear "Reel Power: Book Review", ''Total Film'', December 2010, p.160&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Lobster Magazine]]'', [[Robin Ramsay (editor)|Robin Ramsay]] observes that "If Alford isn’t quite describing the corporations and the state running joint psy-ops, it will do until joint psy-ops come along".  Ramsay reviews the book as "competently done, decently written and, if you’ve seen a lot of American movies – and I have – it is interesting to have the ideological content articulated. I could do it myself, and I’m sort of subliminally aware of it; but most of the time I’m just watching the movie. So the author’s considerable efforts are both useful and entertaining"&lt;ref&gt;Robin Ramsay [http://www.lobster-magazine.co.uk/free/lobster60/lobster60.pdf Book Review: Reel Power,] ''Lobster'', Winter 2010, pp. 148-150&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Roy Stafford, former editor of ''In the Picture'' magazine, says that ''Reel Power'' is a "solid introduction" to Hollywood and American politics but one which is a journalistic popularisation of Alford's more overtly academic work and as such, he implies unfortunately, "renders much that Film Studies has tried to do over the last fifty years... as effectively wasted effort."&lt;ref&gt;Roy Stafford [http://itpworld.wordpress.com/2010/10/15/reel-power-hollywood-cinema-and-american-supremacy/ Book Review: ''The Case for Global Film''], 15 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Scotsman]]'', Hannah McGill, artistic director of the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]] opined that ''Reel Power'' "has its valid points to make [and] is at its best when it identifies and analyses cases of direct influence being brought to bear on film production by the US political establishment [...] its stonewalling of more contentious projects [...] or individuals in positions of constant influence" but that "I felt, on frequent occasion, as if I was in the company of the character Jane Horrocks played in Mike Leigh's [[Life Is Sweet (film)|Life is Sweet]]: the moodily self-righteous teen who hurled the word "FASCIST!" at anyone who failed to mirror her every conviction and desire" &lt;ref&gt;[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/books/Book-review-Reel-Power.6572532.jp?articlepage=1 Book Review: Reel Power,] ''The Scotsman'', 9 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further Work==
A 2017 book, ''[[National Security Cinema]]: The Shocking New Evidence of Government Control in Hollywood'', by Matthew Alford and archivist Tom Secker, updates some of the case studies and uses the Freedom of Information Act to establish more specifically how certain films and TV shows have been affected by [[The Pentagon]] and [[CIA]].

'''Resist dyeing''' ('''resist-dyeing''') is a traditional method of [[dyeing]] [[textile]]s with patterns.  Methods are used to "[[resist]]" or prevent the dye from reaching all the cloth, thereby creating a pattern and ground. The most common forms use [[wax]], some type of paste made from starch or mud,&lt;ref name="BGAfrica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Batik in Africa |url=http://www.batikguild.org.uk/historyAfrica.asp | publisher=The Batik Guild| accessdate=April 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a mechanical resist that manipulates the cloth such as tying or stitching.  Another form of resist involves using a chemical agent in a specific type of dye that will repel another type of dye [[textile printing|printed]] over the top.  The best-known varieties today include [[tie-dye]] and  [[batik]].

==Basic methods==
'''Wax or paste''': melted [[wax]] or some form of paste is applied to cloth before being dipped in dye. Wherever the wax has seeped through the fabric, the dye will not penetrate. Sometimes several colors are used, with a series of dyeing, drying and waxing steps. The wax may also be applied to another piece of cloth to make a [[stencil]], which is then placed over the cloth, and dye applied to the assembly; this is known as '''resist printing'''.

'''Stencils''': a [[stencil]] is placed over the fabric where it is to be shielded from ink, similar to how [[screenprinting|screen prints]] are made.

'''Mechanical''': the cloth is tied, stitched, or clamped using clothespegs or wooden blocks to shield areas of the fabric.

'''Chemical''':  a modern textile printing method, commonly achieved using two different classes of fiber [[reactive dyes]], one of which must be of the vinyl sulfone type.  A chemical-resisting agent is combined with dye Type A, and printed using the [[screenprint]] method and allowed to dry.  A second dye, Type B, is then printed overtop.  The resist agent in Type A chemically prevents Type B from reacting with the fabric, resulting in a crisp pattern/ground relationship.&lt;ref name="chemicalresist"&gt;{{cite web |title = Vinyl Sulfone Fiber Reactive Dyes: Using Remazol Dyes for Chemical Resist Dyeing |url=http://www.pburch.net/dyeing/remazol.shtml#chemicalresist
|publisher=All About Hand Dyeing |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate = April 13, 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Resist dyeing has been very widely used in Eurasia and Africa since ancient times. The first discoveries of pieces of linen was from Egypt and date from the fourth century. Cloth, used for mummy wrappings, was coated with wax, scratched with a sharp stylus, and dyed with a mixture of blood and ashes. After dyeing the cloth was washed in hot water to remove the wax. In Asia, this technique was practiced in China during the T'ang dynasty (618–907), in India and Japan in the Nara period (645–794). In Africa it was originally practiced by the Yoruba tribe in Nigeria, Soninke and Wolof in Senegal.&lt;ref name="BGAfrica"/&gt;

==Traditions using wax or paste==
* [[Guizhou|Guizhou Province]] of China had a strong tradition of wax dyeing

[[Image:Roketsuzome printing wheels.jpg|thumb|200px|Rōketsuzome printing wheels at Roketsuzome Yamamoto, [[Kyoto]].]]
* [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[India]] – [[Batik]] with wax
* [[Japan]] – [[Rōketsuzome]] with wax, [[Katazome]], Yūzen and [[Tsutsugaki]] with rice-paste
* [[Africa]] – Yoruba people of [[Nigeria]] uses cassava paste as a resist while the people of [[Senegal]] use rice paste. Among other terms, [[Madiba shirt|Madiba]].&lt;ref name="BGAfrica"/&gt;

==Traditions using tying or stitching==
* [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]] – [[Ikat]], where only the [[warp (weaving)|warp]] or [[weft]] is dyed (article covers similar techniques elsewhere).
* [[India]]
* Africa – [[Adire (textile art)|Adire]] 
* Modern West – [[Tie-dye]]
* Japan – [[Shibori]]

==Traditions using printing==
* [[Japan]]- [[Katazome|Katagami]] and [[Bingata]] with stencils
* [[China]] – about 500 AD  the ''jia xie'' method for dyeing (usually silk) using wood blocks was invented.  An upper and a lower block is made, with carved out compartments opening to the back, fitted with plugs. The cloth, usually folded a number of times, is inserted and clamped between the two blocks. By unplugging the different compartments and filling them with dyes of different colours, a multi-coloured pattern can be printed over quite a large area of folded cloth.&lt;ref name="cave"&gt;Shelagh Vainker in Anne Farrer (ed), "Caves of the Thousand Buddhas" , 1990, British Museum publications, {{ISBN|0-7141-1447-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rockport Art Association''' is one of the oldest [[art association]]s in the United States. It started as an artist's cooperative and became a gathering place of New England artists of the 20th century. The artists [[Aldro Hibbard]], Antonio Cirino, [[Paul Strisik]], [[Anthony Thieme]], W. Lester Stevens and [[Harry Vincent]] were contemporaries closely tied to its early days.

==Information==
The Rockport Art Association was founded in the year of 1921. Its history has expanded over the past 90 years. In the year of 1921, a group of artists that were attracted to the city of Rockport decided to form the association. The association began in the previous art studio of Aldro T. Hibbard. The Rockport Art Association is commonly called by its acronym of RAA. RAA was originally established as an artist cooperative for art lovers and creators. In the year of 1929, the Rockport Art Association had been placed in its permanent location of an Old Tavern building on Main Street. The RAA had taken location in  a sea captain’s house and over the years it has also been an inn, a tavern, and a stage coach stop before it was founded in its permanent location.

The '''Symphony No. 1''' by [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] was composed between 1973 and 1976, and is dedicated to Sir [[William Glock]], "as a mark of friendship and of appreciation of his work for contemporary music in his years as music controller at the B.B.C." {{harv|Davies|1978|loc=5}}. It was commissioned by the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]], which gave the premiere of the symphony at the [[Royal Festival Hall]], London, on 2 February 1978, with [[Simon Rattle]] conducting.

==Character and materials==
In his First Symphony, Davies addresses both the [[Beethoven]] model of the symphony and [[Sibelius]]'s reinterpretation of it {{harv|Pruslin|1978|loc=7}}. Davies began work on what would become his First Symphony in 1973: a commission by the Philharmonia Orchestra intended to be performed the next year, resulting in a single-movement work of moderate length, provisionally titled ''Black Pentecost''. However, the composer withdrew this score before it could be performed, feeling that it was not complete and needed to extend beyond the already-finished movement. In order to increase his understanding of large-scale orchestral composition, Davies analysed a number of other composers' works, and cites Sibelius's [[Symphony No. 5 (Sibelius)|Fifth Symphony]], the opening of Schumann's [[Symphony No. 2 (Schumann)|Second Symphony]], and the first movement, "Don", from Pierre Boulez's ''[[Pli selon pli]]'' as precedents for specific moments of the composition. As the work evolved, Davies came to the conviction that it "could mark the possibility of a beginning of an orchestral competence", and so decided to designate it a Symphony. The pitches, note values, and longer time-spans are shaped and transformed by [[magic squares]]. Several [[plainsongs]] occur, and are transformed from one into another. The overall tonal centre is F, with a "modal dominant" of D{{Music|flat}} {{harv|Davies|1978|loc=2–3}}.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for piccolo (doubling alto flute), two flutes (second doubling second piccolo), two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, double bassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, timpani, four percussionists (playing marimba, tubular bells, [[flexatone]], glockenspiel, and crotales), harp, celesta, and strings.

==Analysis==
The symphony is in four movements:
# Presto – Allegro molto – Allegro sempre
# Lento – Andante con moto – Allegro moderato – Allegro – Allegro vivo – Presto – Poco meno presto
# Adagio – Più lento
# Presto

After brass and pizzicato strings introduce the basic harmonies of the movement, the symphony proceeds as an allegro movement with "a ghost of a sonata form somewhere behind it", though there are no distinct first and second themes, and development is replaced by processes of transformation {{harv|Davies|1978|loc=3}}.

The second movement is a lento that turns into a scherzo, beginning with a statement of the plainsong [[Ave maris stella]] in the alto flute. It has D as its tonic, and a modal dominant of F{{Music|sharp}} {{harv|Davies|1978|loc=2, 4}}. 

The third movement is the slow movement proper, and has as its tonic the previous movement’s modal dominant, F{{Music|sharp}}, and the corresponding modal dominant A{{Music|sharp}}/B{{Music|flat}} and becomes an invocation of the "extraordinary, almost unearthly, treeless winter land and seascape of the Orkney island" where the composer lives {{harv|Davies|1978|loc=2, 4}}.

The finale parallels the tonal shape of the first. It reaches a climax with an emergence of the "Ave maris stella" material in the form found in Davies's composition of the same title {{harv|Davies|1978|loc=4}}. The silences broken by jabbed chords at the end of the movement refers to the endings of the Fifth Symphonies of both Beethoven and Sibelius. The relationship to Beethoven is expressed exclusively in terms of rhythm {{harv|Pruslin|1978|loc=8}}.

'''''The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith''''' is a 1978 Australian [[drama film]] directed, written and produced by [[Fred Schepisi]], and starring [[Tom E. Lewis]] (billed at the time as Tommy Lewis), Freddy Reynolds and [[Ray Barrett]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/60699 The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1978)] at [[British Film Institute]] website&lt;/ref&gt; The film also featured early appearances by [[Bryan Brown]], [[Arthur Dignam]], and [[John Jarratt]]. It is an adaptation of the novel ''[[The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith]]'' by [[Thomas Keneally]].

The story is about an exploited [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal Australian]] who commits murder and goes into hiding. It is based on actual events surrounding [[Jimmy Governor]].

For Schepisi the film's reception was a disillusioning experience and he left Australia soon after to work in Hollywood, returning to Australia ten years later to make ''[[Evil Angels (film)|Evil Angels]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith'' at the [http://australianscreen.com.au/titles/chant-jimmie-blacksmith/ Australian screen]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Murray |editor-first=Scott |title=Australian Cinema|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin/AFC|location= St.Leonards, NSW.|year=1994|page=85|isbn=1863733116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not prosecuted for obscenity, the film was seized and confiscated in the UK under Section 3 of the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959]] during the [[video nasty]] panic.

== Plot ==

Jimmie Blacksmith, a half-caste child of an Aboriginal mother and a white father, is raised to adulthood by the Reverend Neville and his wife Martha, hoping their influence will civilize him and provide him greater opportunities in early twentieth century Australia. With a letter of recommendation from his foster family, he goes out in search of work to establish himself, but is taken advantage of by multiple parties. His first employer, Healey, repeatedly shortchanges his pay by nitpicking his fencebuilding work, and refuses to write a job recommendation to avoid admitting he himself is illiterate. Jimmie then works for a local constable, Farrell, who uses him as muscle against other local Aboriginals, including capturing a former friend who is later molested and murdered while in custody, and forced to cover up the death. Jimmie finds some stability working on the farm of the Newby family, who still treat him little better than other employers, and decides to summon and marry a white girlfriend, Gilda Marshall, who is already very pregnant when she arrives to move in with him. Gilda later gives birth to a white child, obviously not fathered by Jimmie; while upset at the public embarrassment, he eagerly embraces being a parent.

Shortly after the birth, Jimmie's full-caste brother Mort and uncle Tabidgi come to the Newby property, and Jimmie enlists their help in his fence-building work. However, Mr. Newby uses their presence as an excuse to deny Jimmie his pay and needed provisions, claiming the extra men were not part of their arrangement. Meanwhile, Mrs. Newby and a schoolteacher friend Miss Graf try to convince Gilda to take her baby and leave Jimmie for a teaching opportunity in another part of the country, which Gilda refuses. Furious at the mistreatment his family is facing, Jimmie enlists Tabidgi to help put a "scare" into the Newby women while the men are away, planning to threaten them with hatchets. This suddenly and brutally turns into a rampage that leaves Mrs. Newby, Miss Graf, and all the Newby daughters but one infant dead. Jimmie's family flee the compound, and shortly after Tabidgi, Gilda, and the child are left behind as Jimmie and Mort continue on the run. They soon murder Jimmie's previous employer Healey as well, with Jimmie announcing that he has declared war, in the manner he once heard the fighting against the Boers described. As press coverage about Jimmie's killings become nationwide news, a reporter makes regular probing inquiries to his butcher, whom he is aware doubles as the city's hangman for the police, about what may take place when Jimmie is captured. Tabidgi, since captured and sentenced to death for accessory to murder, tells the convicting court that the decision to kill was not part of the plan and came to them on impulse.

Still uncaptured, Jimmie and Mort come upon a schoolteacher, McCready, who they initially wound by gunfire; he convinces them not to kill him by showing them a newspaper article about their national notoriety. They decide to take him as a hostage instead and take him from his home. As the brothers argue about the morality of their crimes of killing women and children, McCready makes bitterly humorous observations about the influence of white people on the native Aboriginies. He convinces Jimmie to go on alone and abandon Mort by indicating that Mort's soul has had none of Jimmie's detrimental white influences. Mort in turn takes McCready to a farm to recover, but is killed by a hunting party led by the Newby males and Miss Graf's fiancee Dowie Steed. Jimmie himself is shot at in a lake, but manages to crudely tend to his wounds and hide out in a convent for a night. He is found the next morning and taken by police, who vainly try to prevent townspeople from beating him as they take him to jail. In the final scene, Jimmie is read the last rites by Rev. Neville in his cell, as the butcher/hangman from earlier observes them, and declares that despite the (perceived) unique physical characteristics of Jimmie, his hanging will likely go as normal as any other.

It is the second scene in the chronological sequence on the ceiling, depicting the third and fourth day of the [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation narrative]]. 

On the left side of the painting God is depicted from behind, extending his arm towards a bush, alluding to the plant world. On the right side another image of God points towards the Sun with his right hand and toward the faint Moon with his left. His face expresses the force needed for the creation of the abode of living beings. The abstract patterns of [[drapery]] emphasize the motion of both figures of God.

''The Creation of the Sun, Moon and Planets'' is featured on the postage stamps of Vatican City (issue of 1994) and India (issue of 1975).

The '''''Haywain Triptych''''' is a [[panel painting]] by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], currently housed in the [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid, Spain. A date of around 1516 has been established by means of [[dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] research. The central panel, signed "Jheronimus Bosch", measures 135 by 200 centimeters and the wings measure 147 × 66&amp;nbsp;cm. The outside shutters feature a version of Bosch's ''[[The Wayfarer]]''.

==History==
The painting was part of a group of six acquired by king [[Philip II of Spain]] in 1570, and shipped to [[El Escorial]] four years later.  It was later sold to the Marquis of Salamanca, and divided into three paintings. In 1848, the central panel was bought by [[Isabella II of Spain]] and brought to [[Aranjuez]], the right one was returned to Escorial and the left went to the Prado. The triptych was finally recomposed in 1914 in the latter museum.&lt;ref name="Var160"&gt;{{cite book|first=Franca |last=Varallo|title=Bosch |publisher=Skira|location=Milan|year=2004|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy exists at the Escorial.

[[file:The Pedlar, closed state of The Hay Wain by Hieronymus Bosch.jpg|240px|thumb|The closed triptych]]

==Description==

===Shutters===
The exterior of the shutters, like most contemporary Netherlandish triptychs, were also painted, although in this case Bosch used full colors instead of the usual [[grisaille]]. When closed, they form a single scene depicting a wayfarer. Around him is a series of miniatures including the robbery of another wayfarer and a hanged man. The man uses a stick to repel a dog.

According to the most recent interpretations, this figure may represent the man who follows his road in spite of the temptation of sins (such as lust, perhaps symbolized by the two dancing shepherds) and the evil acts occurring around him.&lt;ref name="Var160"/&gt;

===Main panels===
The Haywain triptych follows a similar narrative to ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''.  The left panel shows God giving form to [[Eve]].  Unlike the ''Garden'', though, a narrative sequence flows through the panel in different scenes.  At the top, the rebel angels are cast out of Heaven while God sits enthroned, the angels turning into insects as they break through the clouds. Below this, God creates Eve from the rib of Adam. Next, Adam and Eve find the serpent and the tree; [[Serpent (Bible)|the serpent]] offers them an apple. Finally, at the lowest part of the panel, the angel forces the two out of the [[Garden of Eden]]. Adam speaks with the angel; Eve, in a melancholic pose, looks ahead to the right.

The central panel features a large wagon of hay surrounded by a multitude of fools engaged in a variety of sins, quite apart from the sins of lust which dominates the ''Garden of Earthly Delights''. In the center panel Bosch shows [[Christ]] in the sky, not paralleled in the ''Garden''.  An angel on top of the wagon looks to the sky, praying, but none of the other figures see Christ looking down on the world.  The rightward bow of the figures around the wagon provides the force for the viewer’s eye to move with them on their journey and the cart is drawn by infernal beings which drag everyone to [[Hell]], depicted on the right panel.

The forward kinetic motion of the participants moves the viewer from present-day sin into unadulterated torture in the realms of Hell. The procession on the left side of this panel bends back into the middle ground, but the right side figures continue in a straight line with the wagon, a more evident progress into damnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minnick|first=Nathaniel|title=Hieronymus Bosch’s Triptychs in the Netherlandish Tradition|publisher=University of Michigan|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting materials==
The triptych was thoroughly investigated by the scientists at the Bosch Research and Conservation Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://boschproject.org/ The Bosch Research and Conservation Project]&lt;/ref&gt; with the results published in book form.&lt;ref&gt;Luuk Hoogstede, Ron Spronk, Matthijs Ilsink, Robert G. Erdmann, Jos Koldeweij, Rik Klein Gotink, Hieronymus Bosch, Painter and Draughtsman: Technical Studies, Yale University Press, 2016, pp. 296–313.&lt;/ref&gt; Bosch's palette was rather limited with [[pigments]] including [[azurite]], [[lead-tin-yellow|lead-tin yellow]], [[vermilion]] and [[ochres]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/hieronymus-bosch-haywain-triptych/ Hieronymus Bosch, ''The Haywain Triptych''], ColourLex&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Paradoxes of the Infinite''''' (German title: ''Paradoxien des Unendlichen'') is a mathematical work by [[Bernard Bolzano]] on the theory of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]. It was published by a friend and student, [[František Přihonský]], in 1851, three years after Bolzano's death. The work contained many interesting results in [[set theory]]. Bolzano expanded on the theme of [[Galileo's paradox]], giving more examples of correspondences between the elements of an infinite set and [[proper subset]]s of infinite sets. In the work he also explained the term ''Menge'', rendered in English as "set", which he had coined and used in several works since the 1830s.

The actual construction was done by two Dutch (joint venture) specialist companies, Van Oord and Boskalis. The same companies also created the [[Palm Jumeirah]].

Construction of the 300 islands began in 2003, only to halt due to the [[2008 financial crisis]].&lt;ref name="Sinking"&gt;{{cite news|title='The World' is sinking|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/international/4594274/The-World-is-sinking|accessdate=28 January 2011|newspaper=The Age|date=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though 60 percent of the islands had been sold off to private contractors back in 2008, development on most of these islands has failed to initiate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schaffer|first1=Sierra|title=The "World" Is Sinking Back Into The Sea, Dubai's World Islands That Is – TechMalak|url=https://www.techmalak.com/the-world-is-sinking-back-into-the-sea-dubais-world-that-is/#.WS2awHXyukA|work=TechMalak|date=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2012, the Lebanon Island was developed and was the only island that had so far been developed commercially, being used for private corporate events and public parties. As of late 2013, only two of the islands had been developed. In January 2014, Kleindienst Group announced the launch of "The Heart of Europe" project;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jk-properties.com/newsletters/january2014/ |title= KLEINDIENST GROUP LAUNCHES ICONIC THE HEART OF EUROPE PROJECT|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= January 2014 |publisher= JK Properties |accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by February 2014, one of Kleindienst Group's brands - JK Properties - announced in their monthly newsletter that the project was "well underway".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jk-properties.com/newsletters/february2014/ |title= WORK CONTINUES TO PROGRESS AT A PACE ON THE HEART OF EUROPE  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= February 2014  |publisher= JK Properties |accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these series of islands will be Europe, Sweden and Germany with development led by Kleindienst Group.

==Project==
Islands in the project range from {{convert|14000|to|42000|m2|sqft}} in area.&lt;ref name="Progress Update"/&gt; Distances between islands average {{convert|100|m|ft}}; they are constructed from {{convert|321,000,000|m3|abbr=out}} of sand and 386 million tons of rock.&lt;ref name="Progress Update"/&gt; Designed by [[Creative Kingdom Dubai]], the development is an area that covers {{convert|6|by|9|km|mi}} and is surrounded by an oval-shaped [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] island. Roughly {{convert|232|km|abbr=on}} of shoreline was created. The World's overall development costs were estimated at $13 billion [[Canadian Dollar|CAD]] in 2005.

==History==
The project was unveiled in May 2003 by Sheikh Mohammed&lt;ref name="AB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/507983-the-world-islands-in-dubai-completed |publisher=''ArabianBusiness.com'' |title=The World islands in Dubai complete |date=2008-01-10 |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dredging began four months later in September 2003.&lt;ref name="AB"/&gt;  By January 2008, 60% of the islands were sold, 20 of which were bought in the first four months of 2007.&lt;ref name="Progress Update"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AB"/&gt;  On 10 January 2008 the final stone on the breakwater was laid, completing development of the archipelago.&lt;ref name="AB"/&gt; As of July 2012, a second island, the Lebanon Island was developed and was 'the only island that has so far been developed commercially, is used for private corporate events and public parties.' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/the-world-is-back-on-dubais-map|title=The World is back on Dubai's map|author=Colin Simpson|publisher=|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of early 2011, only one of the islands had been occupied by a building (a show home) on it,&lt;ref name=Sinking/&gt; and commercial or residential properties were not currently being constructed on any of the other islands.

The world economic recovery from the [[Great Recession]] has resulted in a rebound for the Dubai real estate market: it has been reported that "residential prices [in Dubai] rose by 17.9% from August 2012 to 2013, while rents soared by 14.9% in the same period." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jk-properties.com/newsletters/november2013/|title=JK Properties Monthly Newsletter (Nov. 2013) "A BRIGHT OUTLOOK FOR DUBAI’S PROPERTY MARKET" |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=November 2013 |publisher=JK Properties |accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purchase and development plans==

The World was supposed to be serviced by four major transportation hubs linked by waterways. Land parcels are supposedly zoned for various uses: estate, mid density, high density, resorts and commercial.&lt;ref name="video"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.ae/videoGallery.html | title=The World Video Gallery|author=Nakheel}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Dubai Infinity Holdings construction planner has stated that developers have been negotiating with Nakheel about temporary siting of a cement batching plant on one of the islands to supply subdivided construction.&lt;ref name="national3quarters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/property/the-world-three-quarters-sold-out|title=‘The World’ three-quarters sold out|author=The National Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan was for utilities to be routed under water, with water plants at each of the hubs pumping fresh water to the islands. Power was to be supplied by the Dubai Grid and distributed through underwater cables, however as of February 2015 no cables had been laid, so that developers currently have to provide their own power from diesel generators. Waste water and refuse systems are an individual concern for each island.&lt;ref name="video"/&gt;

Nakheel Group is itself further developing a resort named Coral Island over 20 islands that make up the North American part of The World. The low-rise development will include a marina and hotel village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uaeinteract.com/docs/Nakheel_unveils_super-luxury_resort_at_Coral_Island_of_The_World/25125.htm|title=Nakheel unveils super-luxury resort at Coral Island of The World |date=2007-03-05|publisher=National Media Council UAE|accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The second largest confirmed development is the purchase of 14 islands that make up Australia and New Zealand by Investment Dar of [[Kuwait]].  The islands are being [[terraforming|terraformed]] to be developed as a resort named [[OQYANA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiatraveltips.com/news05/134-TheWorld.shtml|title=Nakheel sells Australasia segment of The World|date=2005-04-13|publisher=AsiaTravelTips.com|accessdate=2006-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish business consortium Larionovo had plans to develop the [[Ireland]] island into an Irish-themed resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theislandofireland.com/|title=The Island of Ireland|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans include a large internal marina, apartments and villas, a gym, hotel, and an Irish-themed pub. In July 2007 it was announced that the Ireland Island would feature a recreation of [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[Giant's Causeway]]. However, on 25 November 2008 a provisional liquidator was appointed to Larionovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Tom De Haven''' (born 1949) is an American [[author]], [[editing|editor]], [[journalist]], and writing teacher. His recurring subjects include literary and [[film noir]], the [[Studio system|Hollywood studio system]] and the American comics industry. De Haven is noted for his comics-themed novels, including the ''Derby Dugan'' trilogy and ''[[It's Superman]]''.

==Life and career==
De Haven was born in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="thunderchild" /&gt; He attended [[Catholic School]], where he was a classmate of fellow author [[George R. R. Martin]], though he notes that they weren't friends, even though Martin was an editor of the school newspaper where he was a [[cartoonist]].&lt;ref name="Caroline Miniscule"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thethunderchild.com/Interviews/Books/TomDeHaven2.html |title=Tom DeHaven's Biography |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author=Caroline Miniscule |work= |publisher=ThunderChild}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Haven originally wanted to be cartoonist before attending college,&lt;ref name="Michaux Dempster"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/v4n2/features/de_haven_t_021506/de_haven_t_text.htm |title=An Interview with Tom De Haven |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author=Michaux Dempster |date=Fall 2005 |work=Vol 4, No. 2 |publisher=Blackbird}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by the time he graduated from the university, he realized that he would never be a professional cartoonist, and considers the realization "the First Great Disappointment Of My Life".&lt;ref name="Caroline Miniscule"/&gt; He received a [[Sociology]] degree from [[Rutgers University]] in 1971 and an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] from [[Bowling Green State University]] in 1973.

An avid reader of [[comic book]]s and [[graphic novel]]s, De Haven considers himself a [[Narrative#Literary theory|narrative writer]], and considers the storytelling style of comics to have been a major influence on his writing since he was a child of almost six or seven.&lt;ref name="Michaux Dempster"/&gt;

He began teaching creative writing [[part-time]] at [[Hofstra University]] in 1981, before moving in 1987 to Rutgers to teach [[American Studies]] (including one of the first college courses on American comics) before relocating to Richmond, Virginia to become a [[full-time]] teacher.

De Haven is currently{{When|date=December 2009}} a full professor of Creative Writing at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]] in the MFA program, and often teaches at least one American Studies course, including "The Graphic Novel",&lt;ref name="Caroline Miniscule"/&gt; De Haven is also the co-creator with author Laura Browder of the [[First Novelist|VCU's First Novelist Award]], honoring the best debut novel published during a calendar year. He is also a licensed private investigator.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} He considers himself a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], and has been criticized for anti-[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] statements he has made over the years.&lt;ref name="thunderchild"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thethunderchild.com/Interviews/Books/TomDeHaven.html |title=The Thunder Child Interview |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author=Caroline Miniscule |work=interview |publisher=The ThunderChild}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author noted in an interview that he agreed with [[Robert Crumb]]'s observation that the Thirties was the pinnacle of American culture. He also notes in the same interview that he finds truth to [[Art Spiegelman]]'s statement "that we are, for whatever reason, most nostalgic for the decade before the one we were born in", as he was born in the Forties.&lt;ref name="thunderchild" /&gt;

As a freelance journalist, he has written [[Literary criticism|criticism]] for publications such as the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. De Haven’s novels include the ''Funny Paper'' trilogy (consisting of ''Funny Papers'' (1985), ''Derby Dugan’s Depression Funnies'' (1996) and ''Dugan Under Ground'' (2001)). The trilogy's [[Plot (narrative)|storyline]] stretches from  the beginnings of the newspaper [[comic strip]]s in the 1890s to the 1970s.

The ''New York Times Book Review'' called the ''Derby'' books "a mighty accomplishment: [[John Dos Passos]]’s [[U.S.A. trilogy]] for comic [[geeks]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/07/13/nnp/19817.html |title=Mighty Accomplishment |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author= |year=2001 |work=New York Times Book Review |publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boston Globe]] hails the trilogy as a "wild ride" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chroniclebooks.com/Chronicle/pressroom/0811844358.pdf |title=It's Superman! |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author= |work=Pressroom |publisher=Chronicle Books |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313233804/http://www.chroniclebooks.com/Chronicle/pressroom/0811844358.pdf |archivedate=13 March 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, his novel ''It’s Superman'' reinvented the early years of the well-known superhero of the same name amidst the [[Great Depression]]. The author noted his initial apprehension when he was contacted by [[DC Comics]] in 1997 in regards to writing a novel about [[Superman]]: "[S]hould I do a novel with a character that I don’t own? So I had to think about it, but I didn’t think about it very long, really. I just thought...this is too good to let go...they were giving me [[blank cheque|carte blanche]]."&lt;ref name="Michaux Dempster"/&gt; He states that his prior novels about comic strips are what prompted DC to contact him about writing the [[period piece]]. For the novel, he took as his inspiration the early Superman stories of the thirties through the fifties; wherein the hero is not fighting super-villains and Lex Luthor, but clearing slums in the [[New Deal]] era and expose corrupt politicians.&lt;ref name="Michaux Dempster"/&gt; De Haven says he was aiming for his hero to develop a social conscience during the Great Depression. He states in the interview that only real departure from the Superman that [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] originally created is that while their original hero lived in Cleveland, De Haven places his hero in the real "[[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]" of New York.&lt;ref name="Michaux Dempster"/&gt;

==Awards and honors==
De Haven's awards include a fellowship from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, and he has twice won fellowships from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/v4n2/features/de_haven_t_021506/de_haven_t.htm |title=Tom De Haven |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author=Michaux Dempster |date=November 2005 |work=Interview |publisher=Blackbird}}&lt;/ref&gt; His novel, ''Depression Funnies'', received an [[American Book Award]] in 1997. ''Dugan Under Ground'' received the [[Library of Virginia]] Fiction Award (also called the Library of Virginia Literary Awards.

'''Šovinistička farsa''' ({{lang-sr|Шовинистичка фарса}}), ''Chauvinistic Farce'' in [[English language|English]] is a theatre play, written by [[Radoslav Pavlović]] that performed across former [[Yugoslavia]] prior to and during its dissolution. A total of 4 sequels of the play were produced from 1985 to 1998, and according to one of the main actors, [[Predrag Ejdus]], the play was performed more than 1800 times,&lt;ref name=ejdus/&gt; and was performed in almost every city in former [[Yugoslavia]] that had a decent theatre.&lt;ref name=nadlanu/&gt; Thanks to its great popularity with the audience, the play launched the carriers of then young and later famous, main actors [[Josif Tatić]] and [[Predrag Ejdus]].

The play is mostly set as a dialog between a stereotypical [[Serbs|Serb]], Slobodan Mihajlovic (played by [[Josif Tatić|Tatić]]) and a stereotypical [[Croats|Croat]], Bernard Drah (played by [[Predrag Ejdus|Ejdus]]), both of whom drink heavily. The script derives its capacity to make the audience laugh from the everlasting differences between Serbs and Croats, and the destiny of two people historically, culturally and geographically bound to one another. At first the play may have been seen as controversial due to its departure from then omnipresent dogma of [[Brotherhood and unity]] of the two people. The later events of dissolution of [[Yugoslavia]] have shown the script to be the predictor of an inevitable divorce.

[[Radoslav Pavlović]] received an award for Best script at 11th Satire days ({{lang-hr|Dani satire}}) in [[Zagreb]], 1986.&lt;ref name=kerempuh/&gt;

==Trivia==
[[Petar Božović]] and [[Lazar Ristovski]] were initially cast to play the main roles but abandoned the project during rehearsals. The director then replaced them by [[Josif Tatić|Tatić]] and [[Predrag Ejdus|Ejdus]].
In addition to the main production of the play that toured across the country, independent plays based on the script of ''Šovinistička farsa'' were also produced in [[Zagreb]],  (with Željko Vukmirica and Mladen Crnobrnja playing the main two roles), [[Kruševac]], [[Sombor]], [[Banja Luka]], [[Rijeka]] and [[Varaždin]]. The version of the play produced in [[Zagreb]] was performed for more than 300 times.
