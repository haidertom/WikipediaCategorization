An '''additive group''' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] of which the group operation is to be thought of as ''addition'' in some sense.  It is usually [[abelian group|abelian]], and typically written using the symbol '''+''' for its binary operation.

This terminology is widely used with structures equipped with several operations for specifying the structure obtained by forgetting the other operations. Examples include the ''additive group''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=N. |last=Bourbaki |title=Algebra I: Chapters 1–3 |chapter=§8.1 Rings |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=STS9aZ6F204C&amp;pg=PA97 |year=1998 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-64243-5 |page=97 |origyear=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[integers]], of a [[vector space]] and of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. This is particularly useful with rings and [[field (mathematics)|fields]] to distinguish the additive underlying group from the [[multiplicative group]] of the [[unit (ring theory)|invertible element]]s.

[[File:Backmasking.ogg|thumb|Example of a backmasked recording.]]

'''Backmasking''' is a [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] technique in which a sound or message is recorded backward onto a track that is meant to be played forward. Backmasking is a deliberate process, whereas a message found through [[phonetic reversal]] may be unintentional.

Backmasking was popularised by [[The Beatles]], who used backward instrumentation on their 1966 album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]''.&lt;ref name="sullivan"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sullivan |first=Mark |title='More Popular Than Jesus': The Beatles and the Religious Far Right |journal=Popular Music |date=October 1987 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=313–326 |doi=10.1017/S0261143000002348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists have since used backmasking for artistic, comedic and satiric effect, on both analogue and digital recordings. The technique has also been used to censor words or phrases for "clean" releases of [[Profanity|explicit]] songs.

In 1969, rumors of a backmasked message in the Beatles song "[[Revolution 9]]" sparked the [[Paul is dead]] urban legend.&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.salon.com/2017/06/24/what-exactly-lurks-within-the-backward-grooves-of-stairway-to-heaven/ |title=[Led Zeppelin IV] |last=Erik |first=Davis |date=2005 |work=Salon |publisher=Continuum |isbn=0826416586 |location=New York, NY |language=en-US |oclc=57452450 |access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, Christian groups in the United States alleged that backmasking was being used by prominent [[rock music]]ians for [[satanism|Satanic]] purposes, leading to record-burning protests and proposed anti-backmasking legislation by state and federal governments.&lt;ref&gt;Billiter, Bill (April 28, 1982). "Satanic Messages Played Back for Assembly Panel". ''Los Angeles Times'', page B3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many popular musicians have since been accused of including backmasked messages in their music. However, apparent backmasked messages may in fact be examples of [[pareidolia]] - the brain's tendency to recognize patterns in meaningless data - or coincidental [[phonetic reversal]].&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt;

==History==

===Development===
In 1877, [[Thomas Edison]] invented the [[phonograph]], a device allowing [[sound]] to be [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded and reproduced]] on a rotating cylinder with a [[stylus]] (or "needle") attached to a diaphragm mounted at the narrow end of a horn. [[Emile Berliner]] invented the familiar lateral-cut disc [[gramophone record|phonograph record]] in 1888.

In addition to recreating recorded sounds by placing the stylus on the cylinder or disc and rotating it in the same direction as during the recording, one could hear different sounds by rotating the cylinder or disc backwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kittler |first=Friedrick |title=The Gramophone |work=Adventures in CyberSound |publisher=[[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]] |url=http://www.acmi.net.au/AIC/PHONO_KITTLER.html |archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/13071/20040303-0000/www.acmi.net.au/AIC/PHONO_KITTLER.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-03-03 |accessdate=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, Edison noted that, when played backwards, "the song is still melodious in many cases, and some of the strains are sweet and novel, but altogether different from the song reproduced in the right way".{{sfn|Blecha|2004|p=48}} The backwards playing of records was advised as training for magicians by occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], who suggested in his 1913 book ''[[Magick (Book 4)]]'' that an [[adept]] "train himself to think backwards by external means", one of which was to "listen to phonograph records, reversed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crowley |first=Aleister |authorlink=Aleister Crowley |title=[[Magick (Book 4)]] |origyear=1913 |publisher=Weiser |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-87728-919-7 |page=648}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt; In the movie ''[[Gold Diggers of 1935]]'', the end of the dancing pianos musical number "The Words Are in My Heart" is filmed in [[reverse motion]] with the accompanying instrumental score incidentally being reversed.

[[File:Reel-to-reel recorder tc-630.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tape recorder]]s allowed backward recording in [[recording studio]]s]]

The 1950s saw two new developments in audio technology: the development of ''[[musique concrète]]'', an [[avant-garde]] form of [[electronic music]], which involves [[audio engineering|editing]] together fragments of natural and industrial sounds; and the concurrent spread of the use of [[tape recorder]]s in [[recording studio]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=White |first=Ray |title=Musique Concrète |url=http://whitefiles.org/rws/rx01.htm |publisher = whitefiles.org | accessdate=2007-11-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071118094321/http://whitefiles.org/rws/rx01.htm| archivedate= November 18, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two trends led to tape music compositions, composed on [[magnetic tape|tape]] using techniques including [[reverse tape effects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Peters |first=Michael |title=The Birth of Loop: A Short History of Looping Music |url=http://www.loopers-delight.com/history/Loophist.html |publisher=loopers-delight.com|accessdate=2007-03-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070328220400/http://www.loopers-delight.com/history/Loophist.html| archivedate= March 28, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Beatles]], who incorporated the techniques of ''concrète'' into their recordings, were responsible for popularizing the concept of backmasking.&lt;ref name="sullivan" /&gt; Singer [[John Lennon]] and producer [[George Martin]] both claimed they discovered the backward recording technique during the recording of 1966's ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]''; specifically the album tracks "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]" and "[[I'm Only Sleeping]]", and the single "[[Rain (Beatles song)|Rain]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mugan |first=Chris |title=Subliminal advertising: The voice within |newspaper=The Independent | location = London |date=October 13, 2006 |url=http://arts.independent.co.uk/music/features/article1847509.ece |accessdate=2007-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon stated that, while under the influence of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], he accidentally played the tapes for "Rain" in reverse and enjoyed the sound. The following day he shared the results with the other Beatles, and the effect was used first in the [[guitar solo]] for "Tomorrow Never Knows" and later in the [[Coda (music)|coda]] of "Rain".&lt;ref name="stevens"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stevens |first=John |title=The Songs of John Lennon: The Beatles Years |year=2002 |publisher=Berklee Press |isbn=978-0-634-01795-7 |pages=149, 155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aldridge |first=Alan |title=The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics |year=1991 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=978-0-395-59426-1 |page=135 |quote=On the end of 'Rain' you hear me singing it backwards. We'd done the main thing at EMI and the habit was then to take the song home and see what you thought a little extra gimmick or what the guitar piece would be. So I got home about five in the morning, stoned out of my head, I staggered up to my tape recorder and I put it on, but it came out backwards, and I was in a trance in the earphones, what is it, what is it. It's too much, you know, and I really wanted the whole song backwards almost, and that was it. So we tagged it on the end.&lt;!-- This quote needs to attributed to the speaker, I assume it was Lennon but have not verified from source --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Martin, the band had been experimenting with changing the speeds of and reversing the "Tomorrow Never Knows" tapes, and Martin got the idea of reversing Lennon's vocals and guitar, which he did with a clip from "Rain". Lennon then liked the effect and kept it.&lt;ref name="ev"&gt;{{cite web |last=Olcott |first=Evan |title=Audio Reversal In Popular Culture |url=http://www.triplo.com/ev/reversal/ |publisher = Triplo Press | accessdate=2006-08-26|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060821143244/http://www.triplo.com/ev/reversal/ |archivedate = August 21, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Giuliano |first=Geoffrey |first2=Vrnda |last2= Devi |title=Glass Onion: The Beatles in their own words |year=1999 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0-306-80895-1 |page=265 |quote=I'd introduced John to backwards music on 'Rain' when I took his voice and turned it 'round when he was out on a coffee break.

Rain&amp;nbsp;... When the rain comes, they run and hide their heads" ({{Audio-nohelp|Rain backwards.ogg|listen}}; the last line is the reversed first verse of the song).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cross |first=Craig |title=The Beatles: Day-by-Day, Song-by-Song, Record-by-Record | publisher = iUniverse |year=2005 | location = New York |isbn=978-0-595-34663-9 |page=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
The Beatles were involved in the spread of backmasking both as a recording technique and as the center of a [[controversy]]. The latter has its roots in an event in 1969, when [[WNIC|WKNR-FM]] DJ [[Russ Gibb]] received a phone call from a student at [[Eastern Michigan University]] who identified himself as "Tom". The caller asked Gibb about a rumor that Beatle [[Paul McCartney]] [[Paul is dead|had died]], and claimed that the Beatles song "[[Revolution 9]]" contained a backward message confirming the rumor. Gibb played the song backwards on his turntable, and heard "Turn me on, dead man&amp;nbsp;... turn me on, dead man&amp;nbsp;... turn me on, dead man&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref name="reeve"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reeve |first=Andru J |title=Turn Me On, Dead Man: The Beatles And The "Paul-Is-Dead" Hoax |publisher=AuthorHouse |pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibb began telling his listeners about what he called "The Great Cover-up",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yoakum |first=Jim |title=The Man Who Killed Paul McCartney |journal=[[Gadfly Online|The Gadfly]] |date=May–June 2000 |url=http://www.gadflyonline.com/archive/MayJune00/archive-mccartney.html |accessdate=2007-10-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011195426/http://gadflyonline.com/archive/MayJune00/archive-mccartney.html| archivedate= October 11, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the original clue were added various others, including the alleged backmasked message "Paul is a dead man, miss him, miss him, miss him", in "[[I'm So Tired]]".&lt;ref name="reeve" /&gt;

The "[[Paul is dead]]" rumor popularized the idea of backmasking in [[popular music]].&lt;ref name="sullivan" /&gt; After Gibb's show, many more songs were found to contain phrases that sounded like known spoken languages when reversed. Initially, the search was done mostly by fans of [[rock music]]; but, in the late 1970s,{{sfn|Blecha|2004|p=49}} during the rise of the [[Christian right]] in the United States,&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|last=Holden |first=Stephen |title=Serious Issues Underlie a New Album from Styx |publisher=New York Times |date=1983-03-27 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/27/arts/serious-issues-underlie-a-new-album-from-styx.html |accessdate=2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[fundamentalist Christian]] groups began to claim that backmasked messages could bypass the [[Consciousness|conscious mind]] and reach the [[unconscious mind]], where they would be unknowingly accepted by the listener.{{sfn|Poundstone|1986|pp= 227–32}} In 1981, Christian DJ Michael Mills began stating on Christian radio programs that [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Stairway to Heaven]]" contained hidden Satanic messages that were heard by the unconscious.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=David |editor-last= Barker |title=33{{fraction|1|3}} Greatest Hits, Volume One |publisher=Continuum |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-8264-1903-3 |chapter=Led Zeppelin IV |last=Davis |first=Erik |pages=212–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1982, the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]]'s [[Paul Crouch]] hosted a show with self-described neuroscientist William Yarroll, who argued that rock stars were cooperating with the [[Church of Satan]] to place hidden subliminal messages on records.{{sfn|Denisoff|1988|p=289}} Also in 1982, fundamentalist Christian pastor Gary Greenwald held public lectures on dangers of backmasking, along with at least one mass record-smashing.&lt;ref name="devil"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vokey |first=John R. |first2=J. Don |last2= Read |title=Subliminal messages: Between the devil and the media |journal=[[American Psychologist]] |date=November 1985 |pages=1231–1239 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.40.11.1231 |volume=40 |pmid=4083611 |issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, thirty North Carolina teenagers, led by their pastor, claimed that singers had been possessed by Satan, who used their voices to create backward messages, and held a record-burning at their church.&lt;ref name="robinson"&gt;{{cite web |title=Backmasking on records: Real, or hoax? |last=Robinson |first=B. A |publisher=[[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]] |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_cul5.htm |accessdate=2006-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegations of demonic backmasking were also made by [[social psychology|social psychologists]], parents and critics of rock music,&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news |last=Searcey |first=Dionne |title=Behind the Music: Sleuths Seek Messages In Lyrical Backspin |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2006-01-09 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113677367081541303 |accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] (formed in 1985),&lt;ref name="ev2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Olcott |first=Evan |title=Backwards Messages|journal=Music and Technology |publisher=Triplo Press |url=http://www.triplo.com/ev/column/04.html | accessdate=2007-03-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061122142845/http://www.triplo.com/ev/column/04.html |archivedate = 2006-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which accused Led Zeppelin of using backmasking to promote [[Satanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox |first=Edward |title=Popular music restrictions in America in the late 1980s/early 90s |publisher=edcox.net |url=http://www.edcox.net/research/pre/rockmusic.asp |accessdate=2007-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927033409/http://www.edcox.net/research/pre/rockmusic.asp |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
One result of the furor was the firing of five radio DJs who had encouraged listeners to search for backward messages in their record collections.{{sfn|Blecha|2004|p=49}} A more serious consequence was legislation by the state governments of [[Arkansas]] and [[California]]. The 1983 California bill was introduced to prevent backmasking that "can manipulate our behavior without our knowledge or consent and turn us into disciples of the [[Antichrist]]".{{sfn|Blecha|2004|p=51}} Involved in the discussion on the bill was a [[California State Assembly]] Consumer Protection and Toxic Materials Committee hearing, during which "Stairway to Heaven" was played backwards, and William Yaroll testified.{{sfn|Denisoff|1988|p=290}} The successful bill made the distribution of records with undeclared backmasking an invasion of privacy for which the distributor could be sued.&lt;ref name="devil" /&gt; The Arkansas law passed unanimously in 1983, referenced albums by [[The Beatles]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Electric Light Orchestra]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]],&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; and mandated that records with backmasking include a warning sticker: "Warning: This record contains backward masking which may be perceptible at a subliminal level when the record is played forward." However, the bill was returned to the state senate by Governor [[Bill Clinton]] and defeated.&lt;ref name="devil" /&gt; House Resolution 6363, introduced in 1982 by Representative [[Bob Dornan]] (R-California), proposed mandating a similar label;{{sfn|Poundstone|1983|pp=200–14}} the bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Commerce, Transportation and Tourism and was never passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|97|HR|6363}} from [[THOMAS]]&lt;/ref&gt; Government action was also called for in the legislatures of Texas and Canada.&lt;ref name="devil" /&gt;

[[File:Compact Disc.jpg|thumb|right|The [[compact disc]] made finding backward messages difficult, causing interest in backmasking to decline.]]

With the advent of [[compact disc]]s in the 1980s, but prior to the advent of sound editing technology for [[personal computer]]s in the 1990s, it became more difficult to listen to recordings backwards, and the controversy died down.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt;

===Resurgence===
Although the backmasking controversy peaked in the 1980s, the general belief in subliminal manipulation became more widespread in the United States during the following decade,&lt;ref name="brannon" /&gt; with belief in Satanic backmasking on records persisting into the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first= Kenneth J. |editor-last= Bindas |title=America's Musical Pulse: Popular Music in Twentieth-Century Society|publisher=Praeger |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-275-94306-6 |last=Racocy |first=Rudolf E. |chapter=Introduction: The Importance of Music to People |pages=xvi–xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the development of [[digital audio editor|sound editing software]] with audio reversal features simplified the process of reversing audio,&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt; which previously could only be done with full fidelity using a professional tape recorder.{{sfn|Poundstone|1986|pp= 227–32}} The [[Sound Recorder (Windows)|Sound Recorder]] utility, included with [[Microsoft Windows]] from [[Windows 95]] to [[Windows XP]], allows one-click audio reversal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Help with Windows Sound Recorder |publisher=Capital Community College |url=http://www.ccc.commnet.edu/dl/dl-help/help-SoundRecorder.htm |accessdate=2007-05-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070429121019/http://www.ccc.commnet.edu/DL/dl-help/help-SoundRecorder.htm| archivedate= April 29, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does popular [[Open-source software|open source]] sound editing software [[Audacity (audio editor)|Audacity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Audacity: Features |url=http://audacity.sourceforge.net/about/features|publisher = SourceForge.net | accessdate=2007-05-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070504192124/http://audacity.sourceforge.net/about/features| archivedate= May 4, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the growth of the [[Internet]], backmasked message searchers used such software to create websites featuring backward music samples, which became a widely used method of exploring backmasking in popular music.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt;

In January 2014, the first backmasked video was released as part of a Grammy Awards promotional campaign. A customized video player allowed the user to watch a piece of film accompanied by a music soundtrack both forwards and backwards. The backwards content contained a hidden visual story and the words 'music unleashes you' embedded into the reversed audio track.

[[File:Digital.signal.svg|thumb|right|The switch to [[digital audio]] made recording backmasked messages quicker and easier.]]

Backmasking has been used as a [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] technique since the 1960s. In the era of [[magnetic tape sound recording]], backmasking required that the source [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] tape actually be played backwards, which was achieved by first being wound onto the original takeup reel, then reversing the reels so as to use that reel as the source (this would reverse the stereo channels as well). [[Digital audio]] recording has greatly simplified the process.&lt;ref name="radar" /&gt;

Backmasked words are unintelligible noise when played forward, but when played backwards are clear speech.&lt;ref name="robinson" /&gt; Listening to backmasked audio with most [[phonograph|turntables]] requires disengaging the drive and rotating the album by hand in reverse&lt;ref name="seattle" /&gt; (though some can play records backwards).{{sfn|Poundstone|1986|pp= 227–32}} With [[magnetic tape]], the tape must be reversed and spliced back into the cassette.&lt;ref name="seattle" /&gt; [[Compact Disc|Compact disc]]s were difficult to reverse when first introduced, but [[digital audio editor]]s, which were first introduced in the late 1980s and became popular during the next decade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Portable Digital Audio Workstations (Buyer's Guide) |journal=Theatre Crafts International |date=1997-02-01 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-9303362.html |accessdate=2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; allow easy reversal of audio from digital sources.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt;

===Satanic backmasking===
In the 1973 film ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', a tape of noises from the possessed victim was discovered to contain a message when the tape was played backwards. This scene might have inspired subsequent copycat musical effects.
Although the Satanic backmasking controversy involved mainly [[classic rock]] songs, whose authors denied any intent to promote [[Satanism]], backmasking has been used by [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands to deliberately insert messages in their lyrics or imagery. Bands have utilized Satanic imagery for commercial reasons.{{sfn|Blecha|2004|p=52}} For example, [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]] included at the start of the band's 1985 album ''[[Hell Awaits]]'' a deep backmasked voice chanting "Join Us" over and over ({{Audio-nohelp||listen}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenson |first=K.

When played backwards, the songs "665" and "667" reveal a song about [[Santa Claus]].
[[Marilyn Manson]] used this technique. For example, in the beginning of his song "Tourniquet" when played backwards, his voice is heard saying "This is my lowest point of vulnerability" as explained in his book ''[[The Long Hard Road Out of Hell]]''.

===Aesthetic use===
Backmasking is often used for aesthetics, i.e., to enhance the meaning or sound of a track.{{sfn|Blecha|2004|p=49}} During the [[Judas Priest]] subliminal message trial, lead singer [[Rob Halford]] admitted to recording the words "In the dead of the night, love bites" backwards into the track "Love Bites", from the 1984 album ''[[Defenders of the Faith]]''. Asked why he recorded the message, Halford stated that "When you're composing songs, you're always looking for new ideas, new sounds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Judas Priest's lead singer testifies |newspaper=New York Times |date=August 1, 1990 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/01/arts/judas-priest-s-lead-singer-testifies.html?sec=health |accessdate=2007-04-20 |agency= Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Kubrick]] used "Masked Ball", an adaptation by [[Jocelyn Pook]] of her earlier work "Backwards Priests" (from the album Flood) featuring reversed [[Romanian language|Romanian]] chanting, as the background music for the [[masquerade ball]] scene in ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Zwerin |title=Kubrick's approval sets seal on classical crossover success: Pook's unique musical mix |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/27/style/27iht-pook.t.html |work=[[International Herald Tribune]] | location = Paris |date=October 27, 1999 |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of "[[Before I Forget (song)|Before I Forget]]" by [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], lead singer [[Corey Taylor]]'s voice can be heard saying "...&amp;nbsp;You're wasting it" which is in reference to how [[Rick Rubin]], the producer of their album ''[[Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses]]'', wanted Taylor to change the chorus vocal melody because he felt it wasn't catchy; however, Taylor stood his ground and the chorus stayed unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;"Corey Taylor Interview at 98 KUPD".

One backmasking technique is to reverse an earlier part of a song. [[Missy Elliott]] used this technique in one of her songs, "[[Work It (Missy Elliott song)|Work It]]",&lt;ref name="rap"&gt;{{cite web |last=Corbin |first=Dean |title=Rap/Hip Hop |publisher=Backmask Online |url=http://www.backmaskonline.com/rap.html |accessdate=2006-08-06| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060311023706/http://www.backmaskonline.com/rap.html| archivedate = March 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Jay Chou]] ("[[You Can Hear]]", from ''[[Ye Hui Mei]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jay Chou FAQ |publisher=Jay-Chou.net |url=http://www.jay-chou.net/forums/faq.php?faq=new_faq_item2 |accessdate=2006-06-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628030930/http://www.jay-chou.net/forums/faq.php?faq=new_faq_item2 |archivedate=June 28, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[At the Drive-In]] ("[[300&amp;nbsp;MHz]]", from ''[[Vaya (EP)|Vaya]]''),&lt;ref name="modernrock"&gt;{{cite web |last=Corbin |first=Dean |title=Modern Rock |publisher=Backmask Online |url=http://www.backmaskonline.com/modernrock.html |accessdate=2006-08-06| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060526195316/http://www.backmaskonline.com/modernrock.html| archivedate = May 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lacuna Coil]] ("[[Self Deception]]", from ''[[Comalies]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lacuna Coil—Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Emptyspiral.net—The Lacuna Coil Community |date=October 12, 2006 |url=http://emptyspiral.net/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=69 |accessdate=2006-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707120824/http://emptyspiral.net/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=69 |archivedate=July 7, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A related technique is to reverse an entire instrumental track. [[John Lennon]] originally wanted to do so with "[[Rain (The Beatles song)|Rain]]", but objections by producer [[George Martin]] and bandmate [[Paul McCartney]] cut the backward section to 30 seconds.&lt;ref name="stevens" /&gt; [[The Stone Roses]] have made heavy use of this technique in songs including "[[Don't Stop (Stone Roses song)|Don't Stop]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pomroy |first=Matt |title=The Stone Roses: self-titled |date=October 22, 2002 |publisher=[[PopMatters]] |url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/s/stoneroses-st.shtml |accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Guernica (song)|Guernica]]", and "[[Simone (song)|Simone]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Brown |first=Ian |interviewer=Adam Walton |date=February 2, 2000|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/walesmusic/2011/11/ian-brown-stone-roses-interview-2000.shtml|accessdate=2012-01-25|title=I've only served eight weeks, I can't really write a concept album about jail |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111112003944/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/walesmusic/2011/11/ian-brown-stone-roses-interview-2000.shtml |archivedate= November 12, 2011 |publisher= BBC |work= Wales Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are all backwards versions of other Stone Roses tracks, sometimes overdubbed with new vocals that sound somewhat similar to the initial track when backmasked. Meanwhile, [[Klaatu (band)|Klaatu]] used the reversed vocals from "[[Anus of Uranus]]" (from their first album, ''[[3:47 EST]]'') as the vocals for the song "[[Silly Boys]]" (on their third album, ''[[Sir Army Suit]]''). The lyrics for "Silly Boys" on the lyric sheet from ''Sir Army Suit'' are accordingly printed backwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bradley |first=David |title=Klaatu Identities and Beatles Rumors |url=http://www.klaatu.org/klaatu1.html |date=January 24, 2004 |work=The Official Klaatu Homepage |accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Danish people|Danish]] band [[Mew (band)|Mew]]'s 2009 album ''[[No More Stories...]]'' contains a track, "New Terrain", which, when listened to in reverse, reveals a new song, entitled "Nervous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Terrain / Nervous |publisher=MewX |date=July 28, 2009 |url=http://www.mewx.info/wp/?p=464 |accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When done on tape, such use of backmasking is known as ''[[reverse tape effects]]''. One example is [[Matthew Sweet]]'s 1999 album ''[[In Reverse]]'', which includes reversed guitar parts which were played directly onto a tape running in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simons |first=David |title=Matthew Sweet: Rebuilding the Wall of Sound |journal=[[Guitar Player]] |date=January 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For live concerts, the guitar parts were played live on stage using a backward emulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Simons |first=David |title=Back on the bus |magazine=Onstage |date=January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humorous and parody messages===
[[File:Sox Satanic Subliminals.png|thumb|right|The manual for the popular sound program [[SoX]] includes the "reverse" option "for finding Satanic subliminals"]]

A common use of backmasking is hiding a comedic or parodical message backwards in a song. The [[B-side]] of the 1966 [[Napoleon XIV]] single "[[They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!]]" is a reversed version of the entire forwards record, titled "!aaaH-aH ,yawA eM ekaT oT gnimoC er'yehT". The forward version reached #3 in the US charts and #4 in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= They're Coming To Take Me Away, Ha-haaa by Napoleon XIV |editor-last= Wiser |editor-first= Carl |work=Songfacts |publisher= songfacts.com |url= http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=675 |accessdate= 2007-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WWE]] wrestler [[Al Snow]] had a theme song that had backmasking in it. The song was mostly instrumental, but at one point a clearly audible voice can be heard saying a line of gibberish. When the song is played backward, the gibberish is actually saying "I AM THE ONE IN CONTROL". The message played on Al Snow's character as an unstable mad man.

[[The Beatles]] song "[[Free as a Bird]]" was originally composed and recorded in 1977 as a home demo by John Lennon.  In 1995 a studio version of the recording, incorporating contributions from Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, was released as a new single from ''The Beatles Anthology 1'' project, 25 years after their break-up and 15 years after Lennon's death.  In a humorous self-parody and tribute to Lennon, the surviving Beatles inserted a backmasked clip of Lennon saying "Turned out nice again" at the very end of the song.

[[Pink Floyd]] dropped a backmasked message into "[[Empty Spaces]]":
* ''...&amp;nbsp;Congratulations. You have just discovered the secret message. Please send your answer to Old Pink, care of the Funny Farm, Chalfont&amp;nbsp;...''
* ''Roger! Carolyne's on the phone!''
* ''Okay.''

The first line may refer to former lead singer [[Syd Barrett]], who is thought to have suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] years earlier.{{sfn|Patterson|2004|p=186}} The first known instance of Pink Floyd having a backwards message is on the song "[[Bike (song)|Bike]]". When played backward, it produces a nonsense poem.

In [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]'s "Nature Trail to Hell", from 1984's ''[["Weird Al" Yankovic in 3-D]]'', Yankovic's backmasked voice declares that "[[Satan]] eats [[Cheez Whiz]]" ({{Audio-nohelp||listen}}).&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt; Another early example can be found on [[the J. Geils Band]] track "No Anchovies, Please", from 1980s album ''[[Love Stinks (album)|Love Stinks]]''. The message, disguised as a foreign-sounding language spoken under the narration, is, "It doesn't take a genius to tell the difference between chicken shit and chicken salad."{{sfn|Poundstone|1986|pp= 227–32}}

[[Electric Light Orchestra]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]], following their involvement in the 1980s backmasking controversy, released songs that parody the allegations made against them. ELO, after being accused of Satanic backmasking on their 1974 album ''[[Eldorado (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Eldorado]]'', included backmasked messages in two songs on their next album, 1975's ''[[Face the Music (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Face The Music]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Michel |first=Rob |title=1974: Electric Light Orchestra: Eldorado |work=Counting Out Time |publisher=Dutch Progressive Rock Page |date=August 2002 |url=http://www.dprp.net/proghistory/index.php?i=1974_03 |accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Down Home Town]]" begins with a voice twice repeating (in reverse) "Face the mighty waterfall".&lt;ref name="elo"&gt;{{cite web |title=Secret Messages |work=My Electric Light Orchestra Fan Site |publisher=FutureBright |url=http://elo.futurebright.com/Secrets.htm |accessdate=2006-07-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060828074741/http://elo.futurebright.com/Secrets.htm| archivedate= August 28, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; And the opening instrumental "[[Fire On High]]" contains the backmasked message "The music is reversible, but time is not.

Some messages chastise or poke fun at the listener who is playing the song backwards. One such message was included by "Weird Al" Yankovic in "[[I Remember Larry]]", from the 1996 album ''[[Bad Hair Day]]'', on which Yankovic lightly chastises the listener with the backmasked remark, "Wow, [you] must have an awful lot of free time on your hands" ({{Audio-nohelp||listen}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lick |first=Marty "Gumby" |author2="Happy Steve" Chai| title="Weird Al" Yankovic Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Al-oholics Anonymous |url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/index.html |accessdate=2007-03-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070210010935/http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/index.html| archivedate= February 10, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[The B-52's|B-52's]] song "Detour Through your Mind", from the 1986 LP ''[[Bouncing off the Satellites]]'', contains the message, "I buried my parakeet in the backyard.

[[Devo]]'s hit song "[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]" has [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] saying "Hey come over here!" when the song is played backwards.

Backmasking was also parodied in a 2001 episode of the television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' titled "[[New Kids on the Blecch]]." [[Bart Simpson]] joins a [[boy band]] called the Party Posse, whose song "Drop Da Bomb" includes the repeated lyric "Yvan eht nioj." [[Lisa Simpson]] becomes suspicious and plays the song backward, revealing the backmasked message "Join the Navy", which leads her to realize that the boy band was created as a subliminal recruiting tool for the United States Navy.

The [[Futurama]] episode [[Calculon 2.0]] also has a scene where an installation disc is played backward on what looks like an old fashioned gramophone player, with the words "rise from the dead in the name of Satan" coming from it.

===Critical or explicit messages===
[[File:Zappa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frank Zappa]] used backmasking to avoid censorship.]]

Backmasking has also been used to record statements perhaps too critical or explicit to be used forwards. Frank Zappa used backmasking to avoid censorship of the track "[[Hot Poop]]", from ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'' (1968). The released version contains at the end of its side "A" the backmasked message "Better look around before you say you don't care. / Shut your fucking mouth 'bout the length of my hair. / How would you survive / If you were alive / shitty little person?" This profanity-laced verse, originally from the song "Mother People", was censored by Verve Records, so Zappa edited the verse out, reversed it, and inserted it elsewhere in the album as "Hot Poop" (though even in the backward message the word "fucking" is censored).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=We're Only In It for the Money |last=Pacholski |first=Luke |url=http://www.lukpac.org/~handmade/patio/vinylvscds/money.html |publisher=lukpac.org |accessdate=2006-07-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060718065134/http://www.lukpac.org/~handmade/patio/vinylvscds/money.html| archivedate= July 18, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same album, a modified backmasking can be heard in "[[Harry, You're a Beast]]" with Madge saying, "Don't come in me, in me" repeatedly before she starts crying. In at least one bootleg version of the album, these words are very clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frank Zappa - Bootleg (We're only in it for the money 1967) Parte2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAEyXHOY0qk|website=youtube.com|accessdate=1 August 2016|date=Oct 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is found in [[Roger Waters]]' 1992 album ''[[Amused to Death]]'', on which Waters recorded a backward message, possibly critical of film director [[Stanley Kubrick]], who had refused to let Waters sample a breathing sound from ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Simon |first=Michael |title=Amused To Death Trivia |publisher=Roger Waters International Fan Club |url=http://www.rogerwaters.org/atdtrivia.html |accessdate=2007-03-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208094658/http://www.rogerwaters.org/atdtrivia.html |archivedate=February 8, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The message appears in the song "[[Perfect Sense Part 1]]", in which Waters' backmasked voice says, "Julia, however, in light and visions of the issues of Stanley, we have changed our minds. We have decided to include a backward message, Stanley, for you and all the other book burners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Roger Waters – Perfect Sense |publisher=[[UGO Networks]] |url=http://www.ugo.com/music/backmasked-tracks/?cur=perfect-sense |accessdate=2009-06-13 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120605002334/http://www.ugo.com/music/backmasked-tracks/?cur=perfect-sense |archive-date=June 5, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Censorship===
A further use of backmasking is to [[censorship|censor]] words and phrases deemed inappropriate on [[radio edit]]s and "[[Expurgation|clean]]" album releases.&lt;ref name="nelson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson |first=Chris |title=Sticker Ban Policy: Family Values Or Consumer Fraud? |publisher=[[VH1]] |date=1998-09-08 |url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/501064/19980908/story.jhtml |accessdate=2007-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001091203/http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/501064/19980908/story.jhtml |archivedate=October 1, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[The Fugees]]' clean version of the album ''[[The Score (Fugees album)|The Score]]'' contains various backmasked [[profanity|profanities]];&lt;ref name="nelson" /&gt; thus, when playing the album backwards, the censored words are clearly audible among the backward gibberish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=mcc |publisher=[[Everything2]] |title=Music that sounds better backward than forward |url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=677630 |accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used with the word "shit", this type of backmasking results in a sound similar to "ish". As a result, "[[wikt:ish|ish]]" became a [[euphemism]] for "shit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |editor-last=Rader |editor-first= Walter |work=The Online Slang Dictionary |author= Emily M. |origyear= November 12, 1997 |date= March 5, 2011 |url= http://onlineslangdictionary.com/definition+of/ish |title= Definition of ish: noun |accessdate= 2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Britney Spears]]' 2011 song "[[Till The World Ends]]", Spears says "if you want this good shit". However, on the official version, "shit" is reversed, creating the "ish" sound; therefore, the official version says "if you want this good ish". Backmasking is also used to censor the word "[[joint (cannabis)|joint]]" in the video for "[[You Don't Know How It Feels]]" by [[Tom Petty]], resulting in the line "Let's roll another tnioj".&lt;ref name="TomPettySun"&gt;{{cite web

[[Electric Light Orchestra]] was accused of hiding a backward Satanic message in their 1974 album ''[[Eldorado (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Eldorado]]''. The title track, "[[Eldorado (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Eldorado]]", was said to contain the message "He is the nasty one / Christ, you're infernal / It is said we're dead men / Everyone who has the mark will live."{{sfn|Poundstone|1983|pp=200–14}} ELO singer and songwriter [[Jeff Lynne]] responded by calling this accusation (and the related charge of being "devil-worshippers") "[[bollocks|skcollob]]",&lt;ref name="ftm"&gt;{{cite web |title=Electric Light Orchestra Biogs |publisher=Face The Music |url=http://www.ftmusic.com/biogs/elo/elo_biog.html |accessdate=2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stating that the message "is absolutely manufactured by whoever said, 'That's what it said.' It doesn't say anything of the sort."{{sfn|Patterson|2004|p=174}} The group included several backward messages in later albums in response to the accusations.

In 1981, [[Styx (band)|Styx]] was accused of putting the backward message "Satan move through our voices" on the song "[[Snowblind (Styx song)|Snowblind]]", from ''[[Paradise Theatre (album)|Paradise Theatre]]''.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; Guitarist [[James Young (American musician)|James Young]] called these charges "rubbish,"&lt;ref name="arar"&gt;{{cite news |last=Arar |first=Yardena |title=Satanic records or balderdash: Just what the devil's going on? |newspaper=The Daily Herald | location = Arlington Heights, IL |date=May 26, 1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and responded, "If we want to make a statement, we'll do it in a way that people can understand us and not in a way where you have to go out and buy a $400 tape player to understand us." The vinyl reproduction of ''[[Paradise Theatre (album)|Paradise Theater]]'' had laser etching on side one, spelling out Styx at the top, and two ladies facing each other on the sides. But on side two, the side with the song (Snow Blind) it had a black label with a small hole cut out where you could place the eraser side of a pencil, and play the album backwards to hear the backward message.&lt;ref name="kilroy"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hoekstra |first=Dave |title=Styx makes a statement |newspaper=Suburban Sun-Times | location = Chicago |date=April 1, 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the band released a concept album, ''[[Kilroy Was Here (album)|Kilroy Was Here]]'', satirizing the [[Moral Majority]].

A well-known alleged message is found in rock group [[Led Zeppelin]]'s 1971 song "[[Stairway to Heaven]]". The backwards playing of a portion of the song purportedly results in words beginning with "Here's to my sweet Satan" ({{Audio-nohelp|STH reverse.ogg|listen}}).&lt;ref name="milner"&gt;{{cite web |last=Milner |first=Jeff |title=Jeff Milner's Backmasking Site |url=http://jeffmilner.com/backmasking.htm |publisher = jeffmilner.com |accessdate=2007-03-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070314014834/http://jeffmilner.com/backmasking.htm| archivedate= March 14, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swan Song Records]] issued a statement to the contrary: "Our turntables only play in one direction—forwards."&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt; Led Zeppelin vocalist [[Robert Plant]] denied the accusations in an interview: "To me it's very sad, because 'Stairway To Heaven' was written with every best intention, and as far as reversing tapes and putting messages on the end, that's not my idea of making music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Plant |first=Robert |subjectlink=Robert Plant |interviewer=J.D.

===Subliminal persuasion===
{{further|Subliminal message}}

====Fundamentalist Christian groups====
Various [[fundamentalist Christian]] groups have declared that Satan—or Satan-influenced musicians—use backmasked messages to subliminally alter behavior. Pastor Gary Greenwald claimed that subliminal messages backmasked into rock music induce listeners towards sex and drug use.{{sfn|Vokey|2005|p=258}} Minister Jacob Aranza wrote in his 1982 book ''Backward Masking Unmasked'' that rock groups "are using backmasking to convey satanic and drug related messages to the subconscious."{{sfn|Blecha|2004|p=49}} Christian DJ Michael Mills argued in 1981 that "the subconscious mind is being successfully affected by the repetition of beat and lyrics—being affected through a subliminal message."&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Michael. [http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2007/01/365_days_1_the_.html Hidden and Satanic Messages In Rock Music]. Radio interview, 1981, blog.wfmu.org. [http://blogfiles.wfmu.org/DP/2007/01/001_Michael_Mills_01_Introduction.mp3 Introduction], at 1:22&lt;/ref&gt; Mills has toured America warning Christian parents about subliminal messages in [[rock music]].&lt;ref name="devil" /&gt;

Some Christian websites have claimed that backmasking is widely used for Satanic purposes.&lt;ref name="robinson" /&gt; The web page for Alabama group [[Dial-the-Truth Ministries]] argues for the existence of Satanic backmasking in "[[Stairway to Heaven]]", saying that the song contains the backward message, "It's my sweet Satan&amp;nbsp;... Oh I will sing because I live with Satan."&lt;ref name="watkins" /&gt;

====PMRC====
In 1985, Joe Stuessy testified to the [[United States Congress]] at the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] hearings that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The message [of a piece of heavy metal music] may also be covert or subliminal. Sometimes subaudible tracks are mixed in underneath other, louder tracks. These are heard by the subconscious but not the conscious mind. Sometimes the messages are audible but are backward, called backmasking. There is disagreement among experts regarding the effectiveness of subliminals. We need more research on that.&lt;ref name="pmrc"&gt;{{citation |author= United States Senate |year= 1985 |url= http://www.joesapt.net/superlink/shrg99-529/ |title= Record Labeling: Hearing before the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation |work= United States Senate, Ninety-ninth Congress, First Session on Contents of Music and the Lyrics of Records (September 19, 1985) |location= Washington, DC |publisher= U.S. Government Printing Office |pages= 118–25 |via= Joesapt.net |accessdate= 2007-06-09 |postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Stuessy's written testimony stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some messages are presented to the listener backwards. While listening to a normal forward message (often somewhat nonsensical), one is simultaneously being treated to a backwards message (in other words, the lyric sounds like one set of words going forward, and a different set of words going backwards). Some experts believe that while the conscious mind is absorbing the forward lyric, the subconscious is working overtime to decipher the backwards message.&lt;ref name="pmrc" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Court cases====
Serial killer [[Richard Ramirez]], on trial in 1988, stated that [[AC/DC]]'s music, and specifically the song "[[Night Prowler]]" on ''[[Highway to Hell (album)|Highway to Hell]]'', inspired him to commit murder.&lt;ref name="watkins"&gt;{{cite web |last=Watkins |first=Terry |title=Rock Music: The Devil's Advocate |publisher=[[Dial-the-Truth Ministries]] |url=http://www.av1611.org/rock.html |accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reverse speech]] advocate [[David John Oates]] claimed that "[[Highway to Hell (song)|Highway to Hell]]", on the same album, contains backmasked messages including "I'm the law", "my name is Lucifer", and "she belongs in hell".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Von Ulrich |first=Meyerratken |url=http://www.reversespeech.com/esotera.htm |title=Untitled |work=reversespeech.com |others=Edited by George, Michael, translated from German by Galbraith, Evan |accessdate=2007-03-17 |postscript=. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230184800/http://www.reversespeech.com/esotera.htm |archivedate=December 30, 2006 |df=mdy }} Originally published in ''Esotera'' magazine (June 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; AC/DC's [[Angus Young]] responded that "you didn't need to play [the album] backwards, because we never hid [the messages].

In 1990, British [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Judas Priest]] was sued over a [[suicide pact]] made by two young men in [[Nevada]]. The lawsuit by their families claimed that the 1978 Judas Priest album ''[[Stained Class]]'' contained hidden messages, including the forward subliminal words "Do it" in the song "[[Better By You, Better Than Me]]" (a cover version of a [[Spooky Tooth]] song), and various backward subliminal messages. The case was dismissed by the judge for insufficient evidence of Judas Priest's placement of subliminal messages on the record,{{sfn|Vokey|2005|p=261}} and the judge's ruling stated that "The scientific research presented does not establish that subliminal stimuli, even if perceived, may precipitate conduct of this magnitude. There exist other factors which explain the conduct of the deceased independent of the subliminal stimuli."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sophia |first=Cassiel |title=Subliminal Suicide? |publisher=Metareligion |url=http://www.meta-religion.com/Secret_societies/Conspiracies/Mind_Control/subliminal_suicide.htm |accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judas Priest members commented that if they wanted to insert subliminal commands in their music, messages leading to the deaths of their fans would be counterproductive, and they would prefer to insert the command "Buy more of our records."&lt;ref&gt;Van Taylor, David. KNPB Channel 5 Public Broadcasting, 1982: ''Dream Deceivers: The Story Behind James Vance Vs. Judas Priest''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skepticism===
[[Skepticism|Skeptic]] [[Michael Shermer]] claims that the emergence of the "[[Paul is dead]]" phenomenon, including the alleged message at the end of "[[I'm So Tired]]", was caused by faulty perception of a pattern. Shermer argues that the human brain evolved with a strong [[pattern recognition]] ability that was necessary to process the large amount of [[noise]] in man's environment, but that today this ability leads to [[false positive]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shermer |first=Michael |title=Turn Me On, Dead Man |date=May 2005 |work =Scientific American |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=turn-me-on-dead-man|accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanford University]] psychology professor Brian Wandell postulates that the observance of backward messages is a mistake arising from this pattern recognition facility, and argues that subliminal persuasion theories are "bizarre" and "implausible."&lt;ref name="seattle"&gt;{{cite news |last=Holguin |first=Jaime |title=Backmasking unmasked!

Eric Borgos of audio reversal website talkbackwards.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.talkbackwards.com/ |title= Backmasking and Reverse Speech |work= TalkBackwards.com |accessdate= 2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that "Mathematically, if you listen long enough, eventually you'll find a pattern",&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt; while Jeff Milner&lt;ref name="milner" /&gt; recounts, "Most people, when I show them the site, say that they're not able to hear anything, until, of course, I show them the reverse lyrics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hopper |first=Tristin |title=Student sets up "backmasking" website |date=January 26, 2006 |work=The Charlatan | location = Carleton University, Ottawa |url=http://www.charlatan.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=16842&amp;Itemid=27 |accessdate=2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audio engineer Evan Olcott claims that messages by artists including Queen and Led Zeppelin are coincidental [[phonetic reversal]]s, in which the spoken or sung [[phoneme]]s form new combinations of words when listened to backwards.&lt;ref name="ev" /&gt; Olcott states that "Actually engineering or planning a phonetic reversal is next to impossible, and even more difficult when trying to design it with words that fit into a song."&lt;ref name="ev2" /&gt;

In 1985, University of Lethbridge psychologists John Vokey and J. Don Read conducted a study using [[Psalm 23]] from the [[Bible]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]", and other sound passages made up for the experiment. Vokey and Read concluded that if backmasking does exist, it is ineffective. Participants had trouble noticing backmasked phrases when the samples were played forwards, were unable to judge the types of messages (Christian, Satanic, or commercial), and were not led to behave in a certain way as a result of being exposed to the backmasked phrases. Vokey concluded that "we could find no effect of the meaning of engineered, backward messages on listeners' behaviour, either consciously or unconsciously."{{sfn|Vokey|2005|p=260}} Similar results to Vokey and Read's were obtained by D. Averill in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Averill |first=D. |date=September 12, 1982 |title=Did the Devil make you do it? |newspaper =Tulsa World |location = Oklahoma |page=17}} Cited in {{Harvnb|Zusne &amp; Jones|1989|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1988 experiment by T.E.

The finding of backward Satanic messages has been explained as caused by the [[observer-expectancy effect]]. The ''[[Skeptic's Dictionary]]'' states that "you probably won't hear [backmasked] messages until somebody first points them out to you. Perception is influenced by expectation and expectation is affected by what others prime you for."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=Robert Todd |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |chapter= Backwards satanic messages (backmasking) |title= The Skeptic's Dictionary |edition= online |date=December 28, 2006 |url=http://www.skepdic.com/backward.html |accessdate=2007-04-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070501094630/http://www.skepdic.com/backward.html| archivedate= May 1, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, S.

The '''''CORPS''''' game system, or '''''Complete Omniversal Role Playing System''''', is a [[generic role-playing game system]]. It was created by [[Greg Porter (game designer)|Greg Porter]] in 1990.

When the game was first published, it was available in game stores and conventions. Beginning in 2003, [[Blacksburg Tactical Research Center]] ended publication of CORPS books and related materials. They are available only in a [[PDF]] format download, or printed [[Print on demand|on demand]].

== History ==
In 1987, [[Blacksburg Tactical Research Center|Blacksburg Tactical Research Center ("BTRC")]] published its first game, ''[[Timelords (role-playing game)|Timelords]]'', in which players played characters based upon themselves in a time travel setting.  As a time travel/science fiction based game crossing many possible settings, much of the groundwork was already laid for converting the base system into a truly universal RPG, and in fact some players were already using it as a generic game system.  The CORPS system is loosely based on the ''Timelords'' system, but dropping detailed realism in exchange for speed and playability.

The ''CORPS'' game book was first published in 1990 in a small (by comparison to other RPGs) print run and limited marketing.  This was standard business practice for BTRC, which has tried to never go into excessive debt to introduce a product.  The system was initially criticized for not being a truly universal RPG, focusing only on human centered settings. BTRC attempted to learn from this criticism and make changes in the design of its 2nd edition, published in 1995, and later in its next universal system, ''[[EABA]]''.

In August 2008, [[Applied Vectors]] entered into a new contract to create the CORPS Rules Expansion, which included a host of addons for the original game, including a bestiary and reprinted material from the original first edition game. Although this was a new contract, it followed an unrealised earlier contract entered into some time before. This was made available in April 2009.

In September 2011 [[Applied Vectors]] announced a license agreement with BTRC to produce the 3rd edition of the CORPS roleplaying game. This was intended to be a complete overhaul of the system, but as of March 31, 2018 no product other than the CORPS Rules Expansion has appeared and the company seems to be concentrating its efforts on other game systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/556/Applied-Vectors&lt;/ref&gt;

==System==
''CORPS'' uses a custom d10 based system for most actions.

===Characters===
A character in ''CORPS'' is built based on two types of [[statistic (role-playing games)|statistic]] based on '''Attributes''' and '''Skills'''. These are purchased in a points based system, using Attribute Points (AP) to purchase attributes, and Skill Points (SP) to purchase skills.  The total number of points available to spend depends on the setting and Game Master.  A "normal" human might start with 100AP and 50SP, while a superhero character might start with 200AP and SP (or more).

===Attributes===
Attributes are ranked on a 1-10 scale, with an average human rating a 4-5 in any one attribute and 10 being human maximum. ''CORPS'' uses six basic Attributes: '''Strength''', '''Agility''', '''Awareness''', '''Willpower''', '''Health''' and '''Power'''.

The cost of an Attribute is the square of the Attribute rank purchased, so a Strength of 4 would cost 16AP, and an Agility of 5 would cost 25AP.

===Skills===
Skills are linked to attribute scores via aptitudes (attribute/4) and applied to a specific area. Certain skill level requires Skill Points equal to square of the desired skill level minus the square of the related aptitude. Hence character with a high attribute would have to spend less Skill Points to develop skills related to that attribute.

Skills are further broken down into '''Primary''', '''Secondary'''  and '''Tertiary''' skills.  These break down specializations of specific skills. Secondary skills have a maximum level of one-half of the associated Primary skill, and Tertiary skills have a maximum level of one-half of the associated Secondary skill. The aptitude savings apply only to primary skills.

For example, the character with the ''Firearms'' skill of 4 may decide to also purchase the associated Secondary skill of ''Longarms'' with a maximum of 2, and the Tertiary skill of ''M-16A2'' with a maximum of 1.  This character could then use an M-16A2 rifle with a total skill of 7.

===Ads and disads===
Players can also use the points for additional advantages or gain more points by accepting disadvantages. These are very generic like Age, Authority/Duty, Natural Aptitude/Debility, Physical Advantage/Limitation, Psychological Limitation and Wealth (positive or negative). The system also gives some points for writing a character background and drawing a character portrait.

===Success Rolls===
To keep the system simple and fast moving, success rolls are not needed for many actions.  Any action a character may attempt is rated based on difficulty.  If the character's appropriate skill level is equal to or higher than the difficulty, the action succeeds automatically. If it is lower, the player may roll 1d10. If they roll less than 11 minus the difference between their skill and the difficulty of the action times 2, they succeed.  

For example, the character above with a total skill of 7 attempts an action with a difficulty of 8. It is higher than his skill, so it's not automatic. The difference is only 1, so he needs to roll a 9 or less. (11 - (2x1) = '''9'''). If the action had a difficulty of 9, he would need to roll a 7 or less.

While it may seem confusing at first, this system makes success rolls very quick and predictable. The only rolls ever needed are 9, 7, 5, 3, or 1. Any action with a difficulty more than 5 points higher than a character's skill is therefore impossible unless the campaign uses the "long shot" rule; if the player rolls 1, they may roll again with a -5 difficulty.

===Advancement===
Characters advance by increasing their skills and attributes. During play, characters earn additional Attribute and Skills Points related to the attributed and skills they used in play. The cost to increase a skill or attribute is the difference between the cost of the level they currently have, and the cost of the level they want. Therefore, to improve a Strength score from 5 to 6 would cost 11 points (6² - 5² = '''11'', omitting aptitude savings).

A '''cartogram''' is a [[map]] in which some thematic mapping variable – such as travel time, population, or [[Gross National Product|GNP]] – is substituted for land area or distance. The geometry or space of the map is distorted, sometimes extremely, in order to convey the information of this alternate variable. They are primarily used to display emphasis and for analysis as [[Nomography|nomographs]].&lt;ref&gt;

Two common types of cartograms are area and distance cartograms.  Cartograms have a fairly long history, with examples from the mid-1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Area cartograms ==

An area cartogram is sometimes referred to as a ''value-by-area map'' or an ''isodemographic map'', the latter particularly for a ''population cartogram'', which illustrates the relative sizes of the [[population]]s of the [[countries of the world]] by scaling the area of each country in proportion to its population; the shape and relative location of each country is retained to as large an extent as possible, but inevitably a large amount of distortion results. Other synonyms in use are ''anamorphic map'', ''density-equalizing map'' and ''Gastner map''.&lt;ref name="GN-Diffusion"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Michael T. Gastner |author2=Mark E. J.

Area cartograms may be contiguous or noncontiguous. The area cartograms shown on this page are all contiguous, while a good example of a noncontiguous cartogram was published in [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/11/02/opinion/20081102_OPCHART.html ''The New York Times''].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Cartograms may be classified also by the properties of shape and topology preservation. Classical area cartograms (shown on this page) are typically distorting the shape of spatial units to some degree, but they are strict at preserving correct neighborhood relationships between them. Scaled-down cartograms (from the NY Times example) are strictly shape-preserving. Another branch of cartograms introduced by Dorling, replaces actual shapes with circles scaled according to the mapped feature. Circles are distributed to resemble the original topology. Demers cartogram is a variation of Dorling cartogram, but it uses rectangles instead of circles, and attempts to retain visual cues at the expense of minimum distance. Schematic maps based on quad trees can be seen as non shape-preserving cartograms with some degree of neighborhood preservation.

A collection of contiguous area cartograms is available at Worldmapper,&lt;ref&gt;[https://worldmapper.org/ Worldmapper: Rediscover the world as you've never seen it before]&lt;/ref&gt; which was started by a collaborative team of researchers at the [[University of Sheffield|Universities of Sheffield]] and [[University of Michigan|Michigan]].

One of the first cartographers to generate cartograms with the aid of computer visualization was [[Waldo Tobler]] of [[University of California, Santa Barbara|UC Santa Barbara]] in the 1960s. Prior to Tobler's work, cartograms were created by hand (as they occasionally still are). The [[National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis]] located on the UCSB campus maintains an online [http://www.ncgia.ucsb.edu/projects/Cartogram_Central/index.html Cartogram Central] with resources regarding cartograms.

A number of software packages generate cartograms. Most of the available cartogram generation tools work in conjunction with other [[GIS software]] tools as add-ons or independently produce cartographic outputs from GIS data formatted to work with commonly used GIS products. Examples of cartogram software include ScapeToad,&lt;ref&gt;[http://scapetoad.choros.ch/ ScapeToad]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://artofsoftware.org/2012/02/08/cartogram-crash-course/ The Art of Software: Cartogram Crash Course]&lt;/ref&gt; Cart,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cart/ Cart: Computer software for making cartograms]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Cartogram Processing Tool (an ArcScript for [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]]'s [[ArcGIS]]), which all use the Gastner-Newman algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=d348614c97264ae19b0311019a5f2276 Cartogram Geoprocessing Tool]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The [[R (programming language)#CRAN|CRAN]] package [https://cran.r-project.org/package=recmap recmap] provides an implementation of  a rectangular cartogram algorithm.&lt;ref name="recmap" /&gt;

Cartograms can also be constructed manually, either by hand or in a computer-assisted environment. Block cartograms are constructed by arranging geometrically regular equal-sized blocks, with the number of blocks allocated to each district proportional to the population variable. Several examples of block cartograms were published during the 2016 U.S. presidential election season by ''The Washington Post'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poll: Redrawing the Electoral Map|url=https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo#plus&amp;electoral-map|website=Washington Post|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the ''FiveThirtyEight'' blog  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Election Forecast|url=https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo#plus&amp;electoral-map|website=FiveThirtyEight blog|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the ''Wall Street Journal'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Draw the 2016 Electoral College Map|url=http://graphics.wsj.com/elections/2016/2016-electoral-college-map-predictions/|website=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, among others.

A law based on a prior court decision"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For additional cites giving this definition, see [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|the section on the connotations of the term "common law,"]] below.&lt;/ref&gt;  The defining characteristic of “common law” is that it arises as precedent.  In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past [[precedent]]ial decisions of relevant courts, and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts.  If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as ''[[stare decisis]]''). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a "[[Case of first impression|matter of first impression]]"), and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question, judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue (one party or the other has to win, and on disagreements of law, judges make that decision).&lt;ref&gt;''Marbury v. Madison'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=5&amp;page=137 5 U.S. 137] (1803) ("It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each.")&lt;/ref&gt; The court states an [[legal opinion|opinion]] that gives reasons for the decision, and those reasons agglomerate with past decisions as [[precedent]] to bind future judges and litigants. Common law, as the body of law made by judges,&lt;ref name="HolmesSouthernPacificBrooding"&gt;“The common law is not a brooding omnipresence in the sky, but the articulate voice of some sovereign or quasi sovereign that can be identified,” ''Southern Pacific Company v. Jensen'', 244 U.S. 205, 222 (1917) (Oliver Wendell Holmes, dissenting).  By the early 20th century, legal professionals had come to reject any idea of a higher or natural law, or a law above the law.  The law arises through the act of a sovereign, whether that sovereign speaks through a legislature, executive, or judicial officer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CarpenterColumbiaCourtDecisions"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carpenter |first=Charles E.|year=1917 |title=Court Decisions and the Common Law|journal=Columbia Law Review |volume=17 |issue=7 |pages=593–607}} (common law court "decisions are themselves law, or rather the rules which the courts lay down in making the decisions constitute law.")&lt;/ref&gt; stands in contrast to and on equal footing with [[statute law|statutes]] which are adopted through the legislative process, and [[Regulation (law)|regulations]] which are promulgated by the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] (the interactions among these different sources of law are explained [[Common law#Interaction with statute|later]] in this article).

== Definitions ==
The term ''common law'' has many connotations. The first three set out here are the most-common usages within the legal community. Other connotations from past centuries are sometimes seen, and are sometimes heard in everyday speech.

=== Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law {{Anchor|Disambiguate_statute}} ===
The first definition of "common law" given in ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'', 10th edition, 2014, is "The body of law derived from judicial decisions, rather than from statutes or constitutions; [synonym] CASELAW, [contrast] STATUTORY LAW."  &lt;ref name="Blacks10thDef1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary – Common law|date=2014|edition=10th|p=334|quote=1. The body of law derived from judicial decisions, rather than from statutes or constitutions; [synonym] CASE LAW [contrast to] STATUTORY LAW.}}  ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' is the most-used legal dictionary used among legal professionals in the U.S.{{cite web|url=https://library.law.yale.edu/us-legal-dictionaries|title=U.S. Legal Dictionaries|last=|first=|date=|website=library.law.yale.edu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage is given as the first definition in modern legal dictionaries, is characterized as the “most common” usage among legal professionals, and is the usage frequently seen in decisions of courts.&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DuhaimeDef1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WashingtonProbateDef1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USvTexas"&gt;For an example of this usage in a decision of the United States Supreme Court, see the quote from ''United States v Texas'' in the section “[[Common law#Interaction with statute|Interaction of constitutional, statutory and common law]]” below.&lt;/ref&gt; In this connotation, "common law" distinguishes the authority that promulgated a law. For example, the law in most [[Anglo-America]]n [[jurisdiction]]s includes "[[statute|statutory law]]" enacted by a [[legislature]], "[[Regulation (law)|regulatory law]]" (in the U.S.) or “[[Primary and secondary legislation|delegated legislation]]” (in the U.K.) promulgated by [[executive branch]] agencies pursuant to delegation of rule-making authority from the legislature, and common law or "[[case law]]", ''i.e.'', decisions issued by [[courts]] (or [[quasi-judicial]] [[tribunal]]s within agencies).&lt;ref name="salmond32"&gt;{{harvnb|Salmond|1907|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|first connotation]] can be further differentiated into
; (a) pure common law: arising from the traditional and inherent authority of courts to define what the law is, even in the absence of an underlying statute or regulation. Examples include most [[criminal law]] and [[procedural law]] before the 20th century, and even today, most [[contract law]]&lt;ref&gt;E. Allen Farnsworth, Farnsworth on Contracts, §&amp;nbsp;1.7, Aspen (2004) (although certain fields of contract law have been modified by statute, "judicial decisions [remain] the dominant primary source of contract law.")&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[law of torts]].&lt;ref name="SpeiserLawOfTorts"&gt;Stuart Speiser, et al., The American Law of Torts, §§&amp;nbsp;1:2, 1:5, and 1:6, Thompson Reuters (2013) (describing common law development of tort law in England and the United States, and the "little reluctance [of courts] to overrule (or disapprove statements in) decisions in tort law either now deemed wrong or inadvisedly considered" and disinclination toward any contention that change must be by legislation).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GeneralCommonLaw_w_NoStatute"&gt;''E.g.'', Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Exch 341 (defining a new rule of contract law with no basis in statute); ''Marbury v. Madison'', 137 5 U.S. 137 (1803) ("It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.");''MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.'', 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (N.Y. 1916) (discussed [[common law#CL Common Law Evolves|elsewhere in this article]], adjudicating the tort of negligence that existed in no statute, and expanding the law to cover parties that had never been addressed by statute);  Alexander Hamilton, ''[[The Federalist]]'', Nos. 78 and 81 (J. Cooke ed. 1961), 521–530, 541–55 ("The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution, is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body."); see [[rule against perpetuities]] for a judicially created law originating in 1682 that governs the validity of trusts and [[future interests]] in [[real property]], [[Rule in Shelley's Case]] for a rule created by judges in 1366 or before, and [[life estate]] and [[fee simple]] for rules of real property ownership that were judicially created in the late 12th century as the crown began to give law-making power to courts.&lt;/ref&gt;
; (b) interstitial common law: court decisions that analyze, interpret and determine the fine boundaries and distinctions in law promulgated by other bodies. This body of common law, sometimes called "interstitial common law", includes judicial interpretation of the [[Constitution]], of legislative statutes, and of [[Regulation (law)|agency regulations]], and the application of law to specific facts.&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef0" /&gt;
Publication of decisions, and indexing, is essential to the development of common law, and thus governments and private publishers publish [[law reports]].&lt;ref&gt;In the United States, large legal publishers include West Publishing and Lexis. In the UK, examples of private reports are the [[All England Law Reports]] and the [[Lloyd's Law Reports]]&lt;/ref&gt; While all decisions in [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law jurisdictions]] are precedent (at varying levels and scope as discussed throughout the article on [[precedent]]), some become "leading cases" or "landmark decisions" that are cited especially often.

=== Common law legal systems as opposed to civil law legal systems {{Anchor|Disambiguate_civil_law}} ===
''Black's Law Dictionary'' 10th Ed., definition 2, differentiates "common law" jurisdictions and legal systems from "[[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]" or "[[Codification (law)|code]]" jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Blacks10thDef2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef1"/&gt; Common law systems place great weight on court decisions, which are considered "law" with the same force of law as statutes—for nearly a millennium, common law courts have had the authority to make law where no legislative statute exists, and statutes mean what courts interpret them to mean.&lt;ref&gt;It is characteristic of the common law to adopt an approach based "on precedent, and on the development of the law incrementally and by analogy with established authorities".  ''Robinson v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police'', Supreme Court, [2018] UKSC 4, para.21.[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2018/4.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, in civil law jurisdictions (the legal tradition that prevails, or is combined with common law, in Europe and most non-Islamic, non-common law countries), courts lack authority to act if there is no statute.  Civil law judges tend to give less weight to judicial precedent, which means that a civil law judge deciding a given case has more freedom to interpret the text of a statute independently (compared to a common law judge in the same circumstances), and therefore less predictably. For example, the [[Napoleonic code]] expressly forbade French judges to pronounce general principles of law.&lt;ref&gt;"5. The judges are forbidden to pronounce, by way of general and legislative determination, on the causes submitted to them." [http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/code/book1/c_preliminary.html Code of Napoleon, Decree of March 5, 1803, Law 5]&lt;/ref&gt; The role of providing overarching principles, which in common law jurisdictions is provided in judicial opinions, in civil law jurisdictions is filled by giving greater weight to scholarly literature, as explained [[Common law#CL academic writings|below]].

Common law systems trace their history to England, while civil law systems trace their history through the [[Napoleonic Code]] back to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] of [[Roman law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radford.edu/~junnever/law/commonlaw.htm|title=Description and History of Common Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.berkeley.edu/library/robbins/CommonLawCivilLawTraditions.html|title=The Common Law and Civil Law Traditions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This split propagated to many of the colonies, including the United States. For most purposes, most jurisdictions, including the U.S. federal system and most states, have merged the two courts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule2.htm Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 2] ("There is one form of action—the civil action.") (1938)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="friedmanxix"&gt;{{harvnb|Friedman|2005|p=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, even before the separate courts were merged, most courts were permitted to apply both law and equity, though under potentially different procedural law. Nonetheless, the historical distinction between "law" and "equity" remains important today when the case involves issues such as the following:
* categorizing and prioritizing [[rights to property]]—for example, the same article of property often has a "[[Equitable title#Equitable versus legal title|legal title]]" and an "[[equitable title]]", and these two groups of ownership rights may be held by different people.
* in the United States, determining whether [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|the Seventh Amendment's]] right to a [[jury trial]] applies (a determination of a fact necessary to resolution of a "common law" claim)&lt;ref&gt;"In Suits at common law ... the right of [[Jury trial|trial by jury]] shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law."&lt;/ref&gt; vs. whether the issue will be decided by a [[judge]] (issues of what the law is, and all issues relating to equity).
* the standard of review and degree of deference given by an appellate tribunal to the decision of the lower tribunal under review (issues of law are reviewed ''de novo'', that is, "as if new" from scratch by the appellate tribunal, while most issues of equity are reviewed for "abuse of discretion", that is, with great deference to the tribunal below).
* the remedies available and rules of procedure to be applied.
Courts of equity rely on common law principles of binding precedent.

=== Archaic meanings and historical uses {{Anchor|4. Historical uses}} ===

In addition, there are several historical (but now archaic) uses of the term that, while no longer current, provide background context that assists in understanding the meaning of "common law" today.

In one usage that is now archaic, but that gives insight into the history of the common law, "common law" referred to the pre-Christian system of law, imported by the Saxons to England, and dating to before the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]], and before there was any consistent law to be applied.&lt;ref name="JeffersonToCooper"&gt;One example of this usage is in a letter from Thomas Jefferson to Dr. Thomas Cooper. {{cite web|last=Jefferson|first=Thomas|title=Letter to Dr. Thomas Cooper|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/jefferson_cooper.html|accessdate=11 July 2012|date=February 10, 1814|quote=Authorities for what is common law may therefore be as well cited, as for any part of the Lex Scripta, and there is no better instance of the necessity of holding the judges and writers to a declaration of their authorities than the present; where we detect them endeavoring to make law where they found none, and to submit us at one stroke to a whole system, no particle of which has its foundation in the common law. For we know that the common law is that system of law which was introduced by the Saxons on their settlement in England, and altered from time to time by proper legislative authority from that time to the date of Magna Carta, which terminates the period of the common law, or lex non scripta, and commences that of the statute law, or Lex Scripta. This settlement took place about the middle of the fifth century. But Christianity was not introduced till the seventh century; the conversion of the first christian king of the Heptarchy having taken place about the year 598, and that of the last about 686. Here, then, was a space of two hundred years, during which the common law was in existence, and Christianity no part of it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JeffersonToCartwright&gt;Another example of this usage is in another letter of Jefferson, to John Cartright.{{cite web|last=Jefferson|first=Thomas|title=Letter To Major John Cartwright|url=http://www.yamaguchy.com/library/jefferson/cartwright.html|accessdate=11 July 2012|date=June 5, 1824|quote=I was glad to find in your book a formal contradiction, at length, of the judiciary usurpation of legislative powers; for such the judges have usurped in their repeated decisions, that Christianity is a part of the common law. The proof of the contrary, which you have adduced, is incontrovertible; to wit, that the common law existed while the Anglo-Saxons were yet Pagans, at a time when they had never yet heard the name of Christ pronounced, or knew that such a character had ever existed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; That usage is obsolete today. It is both underinclusive and overinclusive.

"Common law" as the term is used today in common law countries contrasts with ''[[ius commune]]''. While historically the ''ius commune'' became a secure point of reference in continental European legal systems, in England it was not a point of reference at all.&lt;ref name="Ius Commune' p.20"&gt;[[David John Ibbetson]], ''Common Law and Ius Commune'' p.20 (2001) {{ISBN|978-0-85423-165-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]] dealt with lawsuits in which the Monarch had no interest, i.e., between commoners.

''Black's Law Dictionary'' 10th Ed., definition 3 is "General law common to a country as a whole, as opposed to special law that has only local application."&lt;ref name="Blacks10th"&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary – Common law|date=2014|edition=10th|p=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; From at least the 11th century and continuing for several centuries after that, there were several different circuits in the royal court system, served by [[Circuit court|itinerant judges]] who would travel from town to town dispensing the King's justice in "[[assize]]s". The term "common law" was used to describe the law held in common between the circuits and the different stops in each circuit.&lt;ref name="Blacks10th" /&gt; The more widely a particular law was recognized, the more weight it held, whereas purely local customs were generally subordinate to law recognized in a plurality of jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Blacks10th" /&gt;

== Basic principles of common law ==

=== Common law adjudication ===

In a common law jurisdiction several stages of research and analysis are required to determine "what the law is" in a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Kent Gionfriddo, Thinking Like a Lawyer: The Heuristics of Case Synthesis, 40 Texas Tech. L.Rev. 1 (Sep. 2007) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1012220] [https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1209]&lt;/ref&gt; First, one must ascertain the facts. Then, one must locate any relevant statutes and cases. Then one must extract the principles, analogies and statements by various courts of what they consider important to determine how the next court is likely to rule on the facts of the present case. Later decisions, and decisions of higher courts or legislatures carry more weight than earlier cases and those of lower courts.&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'', ''Ex parte Holt'', 19 USPQ2d 1211, 1214 (Bd. Patent App. &amp; Interf. 1991) (explaining the hierarchy of precedent binding on tribunals of the United States Patent Office)&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, one integrates all the lines drawn and reasons given, and determines "what the law is". Then, one applies that law to the facts.

In practice, common law systems are considerably more complicated than the simplified system described above. The decisions of a court are binding only in a particular [[jurisdiction]], and even within a given jurisdiction, some courts have more power than others. For example, in most jurisdictions, decisions by [[appellate courts]] are binding on lower courts in the same jurisdiction, and on future decisions of the same appellate court, but decisions of lower courts are only non-binding persuasive authority. Interactions between common law, [[constitutional law]], [[statutory law]] and [[Regulation (law)|regulatory law]] also give rise to considerable complexity.

=== The common law evolves to meet changing social needs and improved understanding {{anchor|CL_Common_Law_Evolves}} ===
[[File:Holmes Nomination.JPG|thumb|Nomination of Oliver Wendell Holmes to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, 1902.]]
[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] cautioned that "the proper derivation of general principles in both common and constitutional law ... arise gradually, in the emergence of a consensus from a multitude of particularized prior decisions."&lt;ref&gt;Frederic R. Kellog, Law, Morals, and Justice Holmes, 69 Judicature 214 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Cardozo|Justice Cardozo]] noted the "common law does not work from pre-established truths of universal and inflexible validity to conclusions derived from them deductively", but "[i]ts method is inductive, and it draws its generalizations from particulars".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin N. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 22–23 (1921).&lt;/ref&gt;

The common law is more malleable than statutory law. First, common law courts are not absolutely bound by precedent, but can (when extraordinarily good reason is shown) reinterpret and revise the law, without legislative intervention, to adapt to new trends in political, legal and [[social philosophy]]. Second, the common law evolves through a series of [[incrementalism|gradual steps]], that gradually works out all the details, so that over a decade or more, the law can change substantially but without a sharp break, thereby reducing disruptive effects.&lt;ref&gt;The beneficial qualities of the common law's incrementalist evolution was most eloquently expressed by the future [[Lord Mansfield]], then Solicitor General Murray, in the case of ''Omychund v. Barker'', who contended that "a statute very seldom can take in all cases; therefore the common law, that works itself pure by rules drawn from the fountain of justice, is for that reason superior to an [[Act of Parliament|act of parliament]]." I Atk. 21, 33, 26 Eng. Rep. 15, 22–23 (Ch. 1744)&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to common law incrementalism, the legislative process is very difficult to get started, as legislatures tend to delay action until a situation is totally intolerable. For these reasons, legislative changes tend to be large, jarring and disruptive (sometimes positively, sometimes negatively, and sometimes with unintended consequences).

One example of the gradual change that typifies evolution of the common law is the gradual change in liability for negligence. The traditional common law rule through most of the 19th century was that a plaintiff could not recover for a defendant's negligent production or distribution of a harmful instrumentality unless the two were in [[privity of contract]]. Thus, only the immediate purchaser could recover for a product defect, and if a part was built up out of parts from parts manufacturers, the ultimate buyer could not recover for injury caused by a defect in the part. In an 1842 English case, ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Winterbottom v. Wright'', 10 M&amp;W 109, 152 Eng.Rep. 402, 1842 WL 5519 (Exchequer of pleas 1842)&lt;/ref&gt; the postal service had contracted with Wright to maintain its coaches. Winterbottom was a driver for the post. When the coach failed and injured Winterbottom, he sued Wright. The ''Winterbottom'' court recognized that there would be "absurd and outrageous consequences" if an injured person could sue any person peripherally involved, and knew it had to draw a line somewhere, a limit on the causal connection between the negligent conduct and the injury. The court looked to the contractual relationships, and held that liability would only flow as far as the person in immediate contract ("privity") with the negligent party.

A first exception to this rule arose in 1852, in the case of ''[[Thomas v. Winchester]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/thomas_winchester.htm ''Thomas v. Winchester''], 6 N.Y. 397 (N.Y. 1852)&lt;/ref&gt; when New York's highest court held that mislabeling a poison as an innocuous herb, and then selling the mislabeled poison through a dealer who would be expected to resell it, put "human life in imminent danger". ''Thomas'' relied on this reason to create an exception to the "privity" rule. In, 1909, New York held in ''Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co.''&lt;ref&gt;''Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co.'', 195 N.Y. 478, 480 (N.Y. 1909)&lt;/ref&gt; that a coffee urn manufacturer was liable to a person injured when the urn exploded, because the urn "was of such a character inherently that, when applied to the purposes for which it was designed, it was liable to become a source of great danger to many people if not carefully and properly constructed".

Yet the privity rule survived. In ''Cadillac Motor Car Co. v. Johnson'',&lt;ref&gt;''Cadillac Motor Car Co. v. Johnson'', 221 F. 801 (2nd Cir. 1915)&lt;/ref&gt; (decided in 1915 by the federal appeals court for New York and several neighboring states), the court held that a car owner could not recover for injuries from a defective wheel, when the automobile owner had a contract only with the automobile dealer and not with the manufacturer, even though there was "no question that the wheel was made of dead and ‘dozy‘ wood, quite insufficient for its purposes." The ''Cadillac'' court was willing to acknowledge that the case law supported exceptions for "an article dangerous in its nature or likely to become so in the course of the ordinary usage to be contemplated by the vendor". However, held the ''Cadillac'' court, "one who manufactures articles dangerous only if defectively made, or installed, e.g., tables, chairs, pictures or mirrors hung on the walls, carriages, automobiles, and so on, is not liable to third parties for injuries caused by them, except in case of willful injury or fraud,"
[[File:Cardozo Nomination.JPG|thumb|Nomination of Benjamin Cardozo to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, 1932.]]
Finally, in the famous case of ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.'', 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (N.Y. 1916)[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/macpherson_buick.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1916, [[Benjamin Cardozo|Judge Benjamin Cardozo]] for New York's highest court pulled a broader principle out of these predecessor cases. The facts were almost identical to ''Cadillac'' a year earlier: a wheel from a wheel manufacturer was sold to Buick, to a dealer, to MacPherson, and the wheel failed, injuring MacPherson. Judge Cardozo held:

{{quote|It may be that Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co. have extended the rule of Thomas v. Winchester. If so, this court is committed to the extension. The defendant argues that things imminently dangerous to life are poisons, explosives, deadly weapons—things whose normal function it is to injure or destroy. But whatever the rule in Thomas v. Winchester may once have been, it has no longer that restricted meaning. A scaffold (Devlin v. Smith, supra) is not inherently a destructive instrument. It becomes destructive only if imperfectly constructed. A large coffee urn (Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co., supra) may have within itself, if negligently made, the potency of danger, yet no one thinks of it as an implement whose normal function is destruction. What is true of the coffee urn is equally true of bottles of aerated water (Torgesen v. Schultz, 192 N. Y. 156). We have mentioned only cases in this court. But the rule has received a like extension in our courts of intermediate appeal. In Burke v. Ireland (26 App. Div. 487), in an opinion by CULLEN, J., it was applied to a builder who constructed a defective building; in Kahner v. Otis Elevator Co. (96 App. Div. 169) to the manufacturer of an elevator; in Davies v. Pelham Hod Elevating Co. (65 Hun, 573; affirmed in this court without opinion, 146 N. Y. 363) to a contractor who furnished a defective rope with knowledge of the purpose for which the rope was to be used. We are not required at this time either to approve or to disapprove the application of the rule that was made in these cases. It is enough that they help to characterize the trend of judicial thought.

We hold, then, that the principle of ''Thomas v. Winchester'' is not limited to poisons, explosives, and things of like nature, to things which in their normal operation are implements of destruction. If the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made, it is then a thing of danger. Its nature gives warning of the consequences to be expected. If to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser, and used without new tests then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully. ... There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable.}}

Cardozo's new "rule" exists in no prior case, but is inferrable as a synthesis of the "thing of danger" principle stated in them, merely extending it to "foreseeable danger" even if "the purposes for which it was designed" were not themselves "a source of great danger". ''MacPherson'' takes some care to present itself as foreseeable progression, not a wild departure. Cardozo continues to adhere to the original principle of ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright|Winterbottom]]'', that "absurd and outrageous consequences" must be avoided, and he does so by drawing a new line in the last sentence quoted above: "There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable." But while adhering to the underlying principle that ''some'' boundary is necessary, ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.|MacPherson]]'' overruled the prior common law by rendering the formerly dominant factor in the boundary, that is, the privity formality arising out of a contractual relationship between persons, totally irrelevant. Rather, the most important factor in the boundary would be the nature of the thing sold and the foreseeable uses that downstream purchasers would make of the thing.

The example of the evolution of the law of negligence in the preceding paragraphs illustrates two crucial principles: (a) The common law evolves, this evolution is in the hands of judges, and judges have "made law" for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name="SpeiserLawOfTorts" /&gt; (b) The [[ratio decidendi|reasons given for a decision]] are often more important in the long run than the outcome in a particular case. This is the reason that judicial opinions are usually quite long, and give rationales and policies that can be balanced with judgment in future cases, rather than the bright-line rules usually embodied in statutes.

=== Publication of decisions ===

All law systems rely on written publication of the law,&lt;ref name="BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil" /&gt; so that it is accessible to all. Common law decisions are published in [[law reports]] for use by lawyers, courts and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=148|title=Legal Dictionary – Law.com|work=Law.com Legal Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the American Revolution, Massachusetts became the first state to establish an official Reporter of Decisions. As newer states needed law, they often looked first to the Massachusetts Reports for authoritative precedents as a basis for their own common law.&lt;ref name="BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil"&gt;Social Law Library, Common Law or Civil Code?, Boston Mass.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States federal courts relied on private publishers until after the Civil War, and only began publishing as a government function [[United States Reports#history|in 1874]]. [[West (publisher)|West Publishing in Minnesota]] is the largest private-sector publisher of law reports in the United States. Government publishers typically issue only decisions "in the raw," while private sector publishers often add indexing, editorial analysis, and similar finding aids.

=== Interaction of constitutional, statutory and common law{{anchor|Interaction_with_statute}} ===

In common law legal systems, the common law is crucial to understanding almost all important areas of law. For example, in [[English law|England and Wales]], in English Canada, and in most states of the [[Law of the United States|United States]], the basic law of [[contract]]s, [[tort]]s and [[property law|property]] do not exist in statute, but only in common law (though there may be isolated modifications enacted by statute). As another example, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1877,&lt;ref&gt;''Meister v. Moore'', 96 U.S. 76 (1877) ("No doubt a statute may take away a common law right, but there is always a presumption that the legislature has no such intention unless it be plainly expressed.")&lt;/ref&gt; held that a [[Michigan]] statute that established rules for [[solemnization]] of marriages did not abolish pre-existing [[common-law marriage]], because the statute did not affirmatively require statutory solemnization and was silent as to preexisting common law.

In almost all areas of the law (even those where there is a statutory framework, such as contracts for the sale of goods,&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', [https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/ Uniform Commercial Code, Article 2, on Contracts for the Sales of Goods]&lt;/ref&gt; or the criminal law),&lt;ref&gt;[[Model Penal Code]] as adopted in several states, for example, [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/nycodes/c82.html New York's Penal Law]&lt;/ref&gt; legislature-enacted statutes generally give only terse statements of general principle, and the fine boundaries and definitions exist only in the [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|interstitial common law]]. To find out what the precise law is that applies to a particular set of facts, one has to locate [[precedent]]ial decisions on the topic, and reason from those decisions by [[analogy]].

In ([[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law jurisdictions (in the sense opposed to "civil law")]], legislatures operate under the assumption that [[statute]]s will be interpreted against the backdrop of the pre-existing common law. As the United States Supreme Court explained in ''United States v Texas'', 507 U.S. 529 (1993):

:Just as longstanding is the principle that "[s]tatutes which invade the common law ... are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident." ''Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson'', 343 U.S. 779, 783 (1952); ''Astoria Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. v. Solimino'', 501 U.S. 104, 108 (1991). In such cases, Congress does not write upon a clean slate. ''Astoria'', 501 U.S. at 108. In order to abrogate a common-law principle, the statute must "speak directly" to the question addressed by the common law. ''Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham'', 436 U. S. 618, 625 (1978); ''Milwaukee v. Illinois'', 451 U. S. 304, 315 (1981).

For example, in most U.S. states, the criminal statutes are primarily codification of pre-existing common law. ([[Codification (law)|Codification]] is the process of enacting a statute that collects and restates pre-existing law in a single document—when that pre-existing law is common law, the common law remains relevant to the interpretation of these statutes.) In reliance on this assumption, modern statutes often leave a number of terms and fine distinctions unstated—for example, a statute might be very brief, leaving the precise definition of terms unstated, under the assumption that these fine distinctions will be inherited from pre-existing common law. (For this reason, many modern American law schools teach the common law of crime as it stood in England in 1789, because that centuries-old English common law is a necessary foundation to interpreting modern criminal statutes.)

With the transition from English law, which had common law crimes, to the new legal system under the [[U.S. Constitution]], which prohibited [[ex post facto law|''ex post facto'' laws]] at both the federal and state level, the question was raised whether there could be common law crimes in the United States. It was settled in the case of [[United States v. Hudson and Goodwin|''United States v. Hudson'']],&lt;ref name="USvHudson"&gt;[[United States v. Hudson and Goodwin|''United States v. Hudson'']], {{ussc|11|32|1812}}&lt;/ref&gt; which decided that federal courts had no jurisdiction to define new common law crimes, and that there must always be a (constitutional) statute defining the offense and the penalty for it.

Still, many states retain selected common law crimes. For example, in Virginia, the definition of the conduct that constitutes the crime of robbery exists only in the common law, and the robbery statute only sets the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;''Johnson v. Commonwealth'', 209 Va. 291, 293, 163 S.E.2d 570, ___ (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Code of Virginia|Virginia Code]] section 1-200 establishes the continued existence and vitality of common law principles and provides that "The common law of England, insofar as it is not repugnant to the principles of the Bill of Rights and Constitution of this Commonwealth, shall continue in full force within the same, and be the rule of decision, except as altered by the General Assembly."

By contrast to statutory codification of common law, some statutes displace common law, for example to create a new [[cause of action]] that did not exist in the common law, or to legislatively overrule the common law. An example is the [[tort]] of [[wrongful death]], which allows certain persons, usually a spouse, child or [[estate (law)|estate]], to sue for damages on behalf of the deceased. There is no such tort in English common law; thus, any jurisdiction that lacks a wrongful death statute will not allow a lawsuit for the wrongful death of a loved one. Where a wrongful death statute exists, the compensation or other remedy available is limited to the remedy specified in the statute (typically, an upper limit on the amount of damages). Courts generally interpret statutes that create new causes of action narrowly—that is, limited to their precise terms—because the courts generally recognize the legislature as being supreme in deciding the reach of judge-made law unless such statute should violate some "second order" constitutional law provision (''cf''. [[judicial activism]]).

Where a tort is rooted in common law, all traditionally recognized damages for that tort may be sued for, whether or not there is mention of those [[damages]] in the current statutory law. For instance, a person who sustains bodily injury through the [[negligence]] of another may sue for medical costs, pain, suffering, loss of earnings or earning capacity, mental and/or emotional distress, loss of [[quality of life]], disfigurement and more. These damages need not be set forth in statute as they already exist in the tradition of common law. However, without a wrongful death statute, most of them are extinguished upon death.

In the United States, the power of the federal judiciary to review and invalidate unconstitutional acts of the federal executive branch is stated in the constitution, Article III sections 1 and 2: "The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. ... The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority..." The first [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark decision]] on "the judicial power" was ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', {{ussc|5|137|1803|Cranch|1}}. Later cases interpreted the "judicial power" of Article III to establish the power of federal courts to consider or overturn any action of Congress or of any state that conflicts with the Constitution.

The interactions between decisions of different courts is discussed further in the article on [[precedent]].

=== Overruling precedent—the limits of ''stare decisis'' ===
The [[Common law#United States federal system (1789 and 1938)|United States federal courts]] are divided into twelve regional circuits, each with a [[United States courts of appeals|circuit court of appeals]] (plus a thirteenth, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears appeals in patent cases and cases against the federal government, without geographic limitation). Decisions of one circuit court are binding on the district courts within the circuit and on the circuit court itself, but are only persuasive authority on sister circuits. District court decisions are not binding precedent at all, only persuasive.

Most of the U.S. federal courts of appeal have adopted a rule under which, in the event of any conflict in decisions of panels (most of the courts of appeal almost always sit in panels of three), the earlier panel decision is controlling, and a panel decision may only be overruled by the court of appeals sitting ''en banc'' (that is, all active judges of the court) or by a higher court.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''South Corp. v. United States'', 690 F.2d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1982) (''en banc'' in relevant part) (explaining order of precedent binding on the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit); ''Bonner v. City of Prichard, Alabama'', 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981) (''en banc'') (after the Eleventh Circuit was split off from the Fifth Circuit, adopting precedent of Fifth Circuit as binding until overruled by the Eleventh Circuit ''en banc'': "The [pre-split] Fifth followed the absolute rule that a prior decision of the circuit (panel or ''en banc'') could not be overruled by a panel but only by the court sitting ''en banc''. The Eleventh Circuit decides in this case that it chooses, and will follow, this rule."); ''Ex parte Holt'', 19 USPQ2d 1211, 1214 (Bd. Patent App. &amp; Interf. 1991) (explaining the hierarchy of precedent binding on tribunals of the United States Patent Office).&lt;/ref&gt; In these courts, the older decision remains controlling when an issue comes up the third time.

Other courts, for example, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the Supreme Court, always sit ''en banc'', and thus the ''later'' decision controls. These courts essentially overrule all previous cases in each new case, and older cases survive only to the extent they do not conflict with newer cases. The interpretations of these courts—for example, Supreme Court interpretations of the constitution or federal statutes—are stable only so long as the older interpretation maintains the support of a majority of the court. Older decisions persist through some combination of belief that the old decision is right, and that it is not sufficiently wrong to be overruled.

In the jurisdictions of [[England and Wales]] and of [[Northern Ireland]], since 2009, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] has the authority to overrule and unify criminal law decisions of lower courts; it is the final court of appeal for civil law cases in all three of the UK jurisdictions but not for criminal law cases in Scotland. From 1966 to 2009, this [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|power]] lay with the [[House of Lords]], granted by the Practice Statement of 1966.&lt;ref&gt;83 Cr App R 191, 73 Cr App R 266&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's federal system, described [[Common law#CL Canada federal|below]], avoids regional variability of federal law by giving national jurisdiction to both layers of appellate courts.

=== Common law as a foundation for commercial economies ===

The reliance on judicial opinion is a strength of common law systems, and is a significant contributor to the robust commercial systems in the United Kingdom and United States. Because there is reasonably precise guidance on almost every issue, parties (especially commercial parties) can predict whether a proposed course of action is likely to be lawful or unlawful, and have some assurance of consistency. As [[Justice Brandeis]] famously expressed it, "in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right."&lt;ref&gt;''Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.'', 285 U.S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; This ability to predict gives more freedom to come close to the boundaries of the law.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Yeo Tiong Min, "[http://www.singaporelaw.sg/content/SomeDifferences.html A Note on Some Differences in English Law, New York Law, and Singapore Law] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502093747/http://www.singaporelaw.sg/content/SomeDifferences.html |date=2007-05-02 }}" (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many commercial contracts are more economically efficient, and create greater wealth, because the parties know ahead of time that the proposed arrangement, though perhaps close to the line, is almost certainly legal. Newspapers, taxpayer-funded entities with some religious affiliation, and political parties can obtain fairly clear guidance on the boundaries within which their [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] rights apply.

In contrast, in jurisdictions with very weak respect for precedent,&lt;ref&gt;for example, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] issues very few of its decisions in precedential form, Kate Gaudry &amp; Thomas Franklin, Only 1 in 20,631 ex parte appeals designated precedential by PTAB, IPWatchdog (Sep. 27, 2015), and various lower tribunals in the Patent Office give very weak respect to earlier superior decisions.&lt;/ref&gt; fine [[Question of law|questions of law]] are redetermined anew each time they arise, making consistency and prediction more difficult, and procedures far more protracted than necessary because parties cannot rely on written statements of law as reliable guides. In jurisdictions that do not have a strong allegiance to a large body of precedent, parties have less ''a priori'' guidance (unless the written law is very clear and kept updated) and must often leave a bigger "safety margin" of unexploited opportunities, and final determinations are reached only after far larger expenditures on legal fees by the parties.

This is the reason&lt;ref name="EisenbergMillerNewYork" /&gt; for the frequent choice of the law of the State of New York in commercial contracts, even when neither entity has extensive contacts with New York—and remarkably often even when neither party has contacts with the United States.&lt;ref name="EisenbergMillerNewYork"&gt;Theodore Eisenberg &amp; Geoffrey P. Miller, The Flight to New York: An Empirical Study of Choice of Law and Choice of Forum Clauses in {{Sic|hide=y|Publicly|-}}Held Companies’ Contracts (2008). New York University Law and Economics Working Papers. Paper 124, http://lsr.nellco.org/nyu_lewp/124 (based on a survey of 2882 contracts, "New York law plays a role for major corporate contracts similar to the role Delaware law plays in the limited setting of corporate governance disputes. ... New York's dominance is striking. It is the choice of law in approximately 46 percent of contracts," and if merger contracts excluded, over half)&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial contracts almost always include a "choice of law clause" to reduce uncertainty. Somewhat surprisingly, contracts throughout the world (for example, contracts involving parties in Japan, France and Germany, and from most of the other states of the United States) often choose the law of New York, even where the relationship of the parties and transaction to New York is quite attenuated. Because of its history as the United States' commercial center, New York common law has a depth and predictability not (yet) available in any other jurisdictions of the United States. Similarly, American corporations are often formed under Delaware [[Corporations law|corporate law]], and American contracts relating to corporate law issues ([[Mergers and acquisitions|merger and acquisitions]] of companies, rights of shareholders, and so on.) include a Delaware [[choice of law]] clause, because of the deep body of law in Delaware on these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg &amp; Miller at 19–20 (Delaware is chosen in about 15% of contracts, "Delaware dominates for one type of contract—[merger] trust agreements. ... The dominance of Delaware for this specialized type of contract is apparently due to the advantages and flexibility which Delaware's business trust statute.")&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some other jurisdictions have sufficiently developed bodies of law so that parties have no real motivation to choose the law of a foreign jurisdiction (for example, England and Wales, and the state of California), but not yet so fully developed that parties with no relationship to the jurisdiction choose that law.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg &amp; Miller at 19, only about 5% of commercial contracts designate California choice of law, where nearly 50% designate New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the United States, parties that are in different jurisdictions from each other often choose the law of England and Wales, particularly when the parties are each in former British colonies and members of the Commonwealth. The common theme in all cases is that commercial parties seek predictability and simplicity in their contractual relations, and frequently choose the law of a common law jurisdiction with a well-developed body of common law to achieve that result.

Likewise, for litigation of commercial disputes arising out of unpredictable torts (as opposed to the prospective choice of law clauses in contracts discussed in the previous paragraph), certain jurisdictions attract an unusually high fraction of cases, because of the predictability afforded by the depth of decided cases. For example, [[London]] is considered the pre-eminent centre for litigation of [[Admiralty law|admiralty]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/london-becomes-litigation-capital-of-the-world-1031231.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Richard | last=Osley | title=London becomes litigation capital of the world | date=2008-11-23}}. London is also forum for many defamation cases, because UK law is more plaintiff-friendly—in the United States, the First Amendment protection for freedom of the press allows for statements concerning public figures of questionable veracity, where in the UK, those same statements support a judgment for libel.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not to say that common law is better in every situation. For example, civil law can be clearer than case law when the legislature has had the foresight and diligence to address the precise set of facts applicable to a particular situation. For that reason, civil law statutes tend to be somewhat more detailed than statutes written by common law legislatures—but, conversely, that tends to make the statute more difficult to read (the United States tax code is an example).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Taxpayer Advocate Service, 2008 Report to Congress, https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/08_tas_arc_msp_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===
The common law{{mdash}}so named because it was "common" to all the king's courts across England{{mdash}}originated in the practices of the courts of the English kings in the centuries following the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066.{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}  Prior to the Norman Conquest, much of England's legal business took place in the local folk courts of its various [[shires]] and [[Hundred (county division)|hundreds]].{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}  A variety of other individual courts also existed across the land: urban boroughs and merchant fairs held their own courts, as did the [[University of Oxford|universities of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and large landholders also held their own manorial and seigniorial courts as needed.{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}  Additionally, the [[Catholic Church]] operated its own court system that adjudicated issues of [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canon law]].{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}

The main sources for the history of the common law in the Middle Ages are the [[plea rolls]] and the [[Year Books]]. The plea rolls, which were the official court records for the Courts of Common Pleas and King's Bench, were written in Latin. The rolls were made up in bundles by law term: Hilary, Easter, Trinity, and Michaelmas, or winter, spring, summer, and autumn. They are currently deposited in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|the UK National Archives]], by whose permission images of the rolls for the Courts of Common Pleas, King's Bench, and Exchequer of Pleas, from the 13th century to the 17th, can be viewed online at the Anglo-American Legal Tradition site (The O'Quinn Law Library of the University of Houston Law Center).&lt;ref&gt;Documents from Medieval and Early Modern England from the National Archives in London.[http://aalt.law.uh.edu/]  Publications of the [[Selden Society]] include a Year Books series and other volumes transcribing and translating the original manuscripts of early common law cases and law reports, each volume having its editor's scholarly introduction.

The form of reasoning used in common law is known as [[casuistry]] or [[case-based reasoning]]. The common law, as applied in [[civil case]]s (as distinct from [[criminal case]]s), was devised as a means of [[damages|compensating]] someone for wrongful acts known as [[tort]]s, including both [[intentional tort]]s and torts caused by [[negligence]], and as developing the body of law recognizing and regulating [[contract]]s. The type of [[legal procedure|procedure]] practiced in common law courts is known as the [[adversarial system]]; this is also a development of the common law.

=== Medieval English common law ===

The early development of case-law in the thirteenth century has been traced to [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton's]] ''On the Laws and Customs of England'' and led to the yearly compilations of court cases known as [[Year Books]], of which the first extant was published in 1268, the same year that Bracton died.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Plucknett|T. F. T. Plucknett]], ''A Concise History of the Common Law, 5th edition, 1956, London and Boston, pp.260-261&lt;/ref&gt; The Year Books are known as the law reports of medieval England, and are a principal source for knowledge of the developing legal doctrines, concepts, and methods in the period from the 13th to the 16th centuries, when the common law developed into recognizable form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/law/faculty-scholarship/legal-history-the-year-books/ BUSL, ''Legal History: The Year Books'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge History of English and American Literature ''The Year Books and their Value''[http://www.bartleby.com/218/1309.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Westminster Hall edited.jpg|thumb|A view of [[Westminster Hall]] in the [[Palace of Westminster]], [[London]], early 19th century.]]

In 1154, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] became the first [[Plantagenet]] king. Among many achievements, Henry institutionalized common law by creating a unified system of law "common" to the country through incorporating and elevating local custom to the national, ending local control and peculiarities, eliminating arbitrary remedies and reinstating a [[jury]] system—citizens sworn on oath to investigate reliable criminal accusations and civil claims. The jury reached its [[verdict]] through evaluating common [[Traditional knowledge|local knowledge]], not necessarily through the presentation of [[evidence (law)|evidence]], a distinguishing factor from today's civil and criminal court systems.

Henry II developed the practice of sending judges from his own central court to hear the various disputes throughout the country. His judges would resolve disputes on an [[ad hoc]] basis according to what they interpreted the customs to be. The king's judges would then return to London and often discuss their cases and the decisions they made with the other judges. These decisions would be recorded and filed. In time, a rule, known as ''stare decisis'' (also commonly known as precedent) developed, whereby a judge would be bound to follow the decision of an earlier judge; he was required to adopt the earlier judge's interpretation of the law and apply the same principles promulgated by that earlier judge if the two cases had similar facts to one another. Once judges began to regard each other's decisions to be binding precedent, the pre-Norman system of local customs and law varying in each locality was replaced by a system that was (at least in theory, though not always in practice) common throughout the whole country, hence the name "common law".

Henry II's creation of a powerful and unified court system, which curbed somewhat the power of [[canon law|canonical]] (church) courts, brought him (and England) into conflict with the church, most famously with [[Thomas Becket]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. The murder of the Archbishop gave rise to a wave of popular outrage against the King. Henry was forced to repeal the disputed laws and to abandon his efforts to hold church members accountable for secular crimes (see also [[Constitutions of Clarendon]]).

The English [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]] was established after [[Magna Carta]] to try lawsuits between commoners in which the monarch had no interest. Its judges sat in open court in the Great Hall of the king's [[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Palace of Westminster]], permanently except in the vacations between the four terms of the [[Legal year]].

Judge-made common law operated as the primary source of law for several hundred years, before [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] acquired legislative powers to create [[statutory law]]. It is important to understand that common law is the older and more traditional source of law, and legislative power is simply a layer applied on top of the older common law foundation. Since the 12th century, courts have had parallel and co-equal authority to make law&lt;ref name="William Burnham 2006"&gt;William Burnham, ''Introduction to the Law and Legal System of the United States'', 4th ed. (St. Paul, Thomson West, 2006), 42.&lt;/ref&gt;—"legislating from the bench" is a traditional and essential function of courts, which was carried over into the U.S. system as an essential component of the "judicial power" specified by Article III of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref name="GeneralCommonLaw_w_NoStatute" /&gt; Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] summarized centuries of history in 1917, "judges do and must legislate."&lt;ref name="HolmesSouthernPacificLegislate"&gt;''Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen'', 244 U.S. 205, 221 (1917) (Holmes, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; There are legitimate debates on how the powers of courts and legislatures should be balanced. However, the view that courts lack law-making power is historically inaccurate and constitutionally unsupportable.

In England, judges have devised a number of rules as to [[Mechanisms of the English common law|how to deal with precedent decisions]].

=== Influence of Roman law ===
The term "common law" is often used as a contrast to Roman-derived "civil law", and the fundamental processes and forms of reasoning in the two are quite different. Nonetheless, there has been considerable cross-fertilization of ideas, while the two traditions and sets of foundational principles remain distinct.

By the time of the rediscovery of the [[Roman law]] in Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, the common law had already developed far enough to prevent a Roman law reception as it occurred on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., R. C. van Caenegem, ''The Birth of the English Common Law'' 89–92 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first common law scholars, most notably [[Ranulf de Glanvill|Glanvill]] and [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]], as well as the early royal common law judges, had been well accustomed with Roman law. Often, they were clerics trained in the Roman canon law.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [[Peter Birks]], Grant McLeod, ''Justinian's Institutes'' 7 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first and throughout its history one of the most significant treatises of the common law, Bracton's ''De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae'' (On the Laws and Customs of England), was heavily influenced by the division of the law in Justinian's ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis|Institutes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., George E. Woodbine (ed.), Samuel E. Thorne (transl.), ''Bracton on the Laws and Customs of England'', Vol. I (Introduction) 46 (1968); Carl Güterbock, ''Bracton and his Relation to the Roman Law'' 35–38 (1866).&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of Roman law had decreased sharply after the age of Bracton, but the Roman divisions of actions into ''[[in rem]]'' (typically, actions against a ''thing'' or property for the purpose of gaining title to that property; must be filed in a court where the property is located) and ''[[in personam]]'' (typically, actions directed against a person; these can affect a person's rights and, since a person often owns things, his property too) used by Bracton had a lasting effect and laid the groundwork for a return of Roman law structural concepts in the 18th and 19th centuries. Signs of this can be found in Blackstone's ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'',&lt;ref&gt;Stephen P. Buhofer, ''Structuring the Law: The Common Law and the Roman Institutional System'', Swiss Review of International and European Law (SZIER/RSDIE) 5/2007, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and Roman law ideas regained importance with the revival of academic law schools in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stein, ''Continental Influences on English Legal thought, 1600–1900'', ''in'' Peter Stein, ''The Character and Influence of the Roman Civil Law'' 223 ''et seq''. (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, today, the main systematic divisions of the law into property, contract, and tort (and to some extent [[unjust enrichment]]) can be found in the civil law as well as in the common law.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Stephen P. Buhofer, ''Structuring the Law: The Common Law and the Roman Institutional System'', Swiss Review of International and European Law (SZIER/RSDIE) 5/2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coke and Blackstone ===

The first attempt at a comprehensive compilation of centuries of common law was by Lord Chief Justice [[Edward Coke]], in his treatise, ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'' in the 17th century.

The next definitive historical treatise on the common law is ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', written by Sir [[William Blackstone]] and first published in 1765–1769.

=== Propagation of the common law to the colonies and Commonwealth by reception statutes ===

{{anchor|CL_Reception_Statutes}}A [[reception statute]] is a statutory law adopted as a former British colony becomes independent, by which the new nation adopts (i.e. receives) pre-independence common law, to the extent not explicitly rejected by the [[legislative body]] or [[constitution]] of the new nation. Reception statutes generally consider the English common law dating prior to independence, and the precedent originating from it, as the default law, because of the importance of using an extensive and predictable body of law to govern the conduct of citizens and businesses in a new state. All U.S. states, with the partial exception of [[Common law#Louisiana (1700s)|Louisiana]], have either implemented reception statutes or adopted the common law by judicial opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wl3KFBnC0P0C Thinking like a lawyer: an introduction to legal reasoning] (Westview Press, 1996), pg. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of reception statutes in the United States, the states of the U.S., Canada and its provinces, and Hong Kong, are discussed in the [[reception statute]] article.

Yet, adoption of the common law in the newly-independent nation was not a foregone conclusion, and was controversial. Immediately after the American Revolution, there was widespread distrust and hostility to anything British, and the common law was no exception.&lt;ref name=BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil /&gt; Jeffersonians decried lawyers and their common law tradition as threats to the new republic. The Jeffersonians preferred a legislatively-enacted civil law under the control of the political process, rather than the common law developed by judges that—by design—were insulated from the political process. The Federalists believed that the common law was the birthright of Independence: after all, the natural rights to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" were the rights protected by common law. Even advocates for the common law approach noted that it was not an ideal fit for the newly-independent colonies: judges and lawyers alike were severely hindered by a lack of printed legal materials. Before Independence, the most comprehensive law libraries had been maintained by Tory lawyers, and those libraries vanished with the loyalist expatriation, and the ability to print books was limited. Lawyer (later president) John Adams complained that he "suffered very much for the want of books". To bootstrap this most basic need of a common law system—knowable, written law—in 1803, lawyers in Massachusetts donated their books to found a law library.&lt;ref name=BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil /&gt;  A Jeffersonian newspaper criticized the library, as it would carry forward "all the old authorities practiced in England for centuries back ... whereby a new system of jurisprudence [will be founded] on the high monarchical system [to] become the Common Law of this Commonwealth... [The library] may hereafter have a very unsocial purpose."&lt;ref name=BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil /&gt;

=== Decline of Latin maxims and "blind imitation of the past", and adding flexibility to ''stare decisis'' {{Anchor|History_and_Holmes}} ===
Well into the 19th century, ancient maxims played a large role in common law adjudication. Many of these maxims had originated in Roman Law, migrated to England before the introduction of Christianity to the British Isles, and were typically stated in Latin even in English decisions. Many examples are familiar in everyday speech even today, "[[Nemo iudex in causa sua|One cannot be a judge in one's own cause]]" (see [[Dr. Bonham's Case]]), rights are reciprocal to obligations, and the like. Judicial decisions and treatises of the 17th and 18th centuries, such at those of Lord Chief Justice [[Edward Coke]], presented the common law as a collection of such maxims.

Reliance on old maxims and rigid adherence to precedent, no matter how old or ill-considered, came under critical discussion in the late 19th century, starting in the United States. [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] in his famous article, "The Path of the Law",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=10 |journal=Harvard Law Review |pages=457, 469 |year=1897|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2373|title=The Path of the Law|first=Oliver Wendell |last=Holmes, Jr.|doi=10.2307/1322028|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; commented, "It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past." Justice Holmes noted that study of maxims might be sufficient for "the man of the present", but "the man of the future is the man of statistics and the master of economics". In an 1880 lecture at Harvard, he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[[The Common Law (Holmes)|The Common Law]] [https://archive.org/details/commonlaw00holmuoft O. W. Holmes, Jr., ''The Common Law'']&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience. The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow men, have had a good deal more to do than the [[:w:syllogism|syllogism]] in determining the rules by which men should be governed. The law embodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the [[:w:axiom|axioms]] and corollaries of a book of mathematics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the early 20th century, [[Louis Brandeis]], later appointed to the United States Supreme Court, became noted for his use of policy-driving facts and economics in [[Brandeis Brief|his briefs]], and extensive appendices presenting facts that lead a judge to the advocate's conclusion. By this time, briefs relied more on facts than on Latin maxims.

Reliance on old maxims is now deprecated.&lt;ref&gt;''Acree v. Republic of Iraq'', 370 F.3d 41 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (Roberts, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt; Common law decisions today reflect both precedent and policy judgment drawn from economics, the social sciences, business, decisions of foreign courts, and the like. The degree to which these external factors ''should'' influence adjudication is the subject of active debate, but it is indisputable that judges ''do'' draw on experience and learning from everyday life, from other fields, and from other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roper v. Simmons]], 543 U.S. 551 (2005) (holding unconstitutional to impose capital punishment for crimes committed while under the age of 18, based on "evolving standards of decency", largely based on other nations' law)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1870 through 20th century, and the procedural merger of law and equity ===
&lt;!-- "Fusion of law and equity" redirects here. Please edit redirect if changing the name of this section header --&gt;
As early as the 15th century, it became the practice that litigants who felt they had been cheated by the common law system would petition the King in person. For example, they might argue that an award of damages (at [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|common law (as opposed to equity)]]) was not sufficient redress for a trespasser occupying their land, and instead request that the trespasser be evicted. From this developed the system of [[Equity (law)|equity]], administered by the [[Lord Chancellor]], in the courts of [[Court of equity|chancery]]. By their nature, equity and law were frequently in conflict and litigation would frequently continue for years as one court countermanded the other,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Salmond|1907|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though it was established by the 17th century that equity should prevail.

In England, courts of law ([[Common law#Disambiguate equity|as opposed to equity]]) were combined with [[Court of equity|courts of equity]] by the [[Judicature Acts]] of 1873 and 1875, with equity prevailing in case of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Lobban, Michael "Preparing for Fusion: Reforming the Nineteenth-Century Court of Chancery, Part II | year=2004 | work=Law and History Review, 2004 (University of Illinois Press) . {{ISSN|0738-2480}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, parallel systems of [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law]] (providing money [[damages]], with cases heard by a jury upon either party's request) and equity (fashioning a remedy to fit the situation, including injunctive relief, heard by a judge) survived well into the 20th century. The [[United States federal courts]] procedurally separated law and equity: the same judges could hear either kind of case, but a given case could only pursue causes in law or in equity, and the two kinds of cases proceeded under different procedural rules. This became problematic when a given case required both money damages and injunctive relief. In 1937, the new [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] combined [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law]] and equity into one form of action, the "civil action". Fed.R.Civ.P. {{frcp|2}}. The distinction survives to the extent that issues that were "[[Common law#Disambiguate equity|common law (as opposed to equity)]]" as of 1791 (the date of adoption of the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]]) are still subject to the right of either party to request a jury, and "equity" issues are decided by a judge.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.'', 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996) ("[W]e [the U.S. Supreme Court] have understood that the right of trial by jury thus preserved is the right which existed under the English [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|common law (as opposed to equity)]] when the Amendment was adopted. In keeping with our longstanding adherence to this 'historical test,', we ask, first, whether we are dealing with a cause of action that either was tried at [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law (as opposed to equity)]] at the time of the founding or is at least analogous to one that was. If the action in question belongs in the law category, we then ask whether the particular trial decision must fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance of the common-law right as it existed in 1791." citations and quotations omitted, holding that interpretation of the scope of a patent had no analogy in 1790, and is thus a question to be decided by a judge, not a jury)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Delaware]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Tennessee]] still have separate courts of [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law]] and equity, for example, the [[Delaware Court of Chancery|Court of Chancery]]. In many [[U.S. state|states]] there are separate divisions for law and equity within one court.

=== Common law pleading and its abolition in the early 20th century ===

For centuries, through the 19th century, the common law recognized only specific [[Form of action|forms of action]], and required very careful drafting of the opening pleading (called a [[writ]]) to slot into exactly one of them: Debt, Detinue, Covenant, Special Assumpsit, General Assumpsit, Trespass, Trover, Replevin, Case (or Trespass on the Case), and Ejectment.&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Maitland, ''The Forms of Action at Common Law'', 1909, Lecture I, online [https://legacy.fordham.edu/Halsall/basis/maitland-formsofaction.asp] or John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common Law Pleading (1894) or [[James Barr Ames|Ames]], [[Joseph Chitty|Chitty]], [[Henry John Stephen|Stephen]], [[James Bradley Thayer|Thayer]] and other writers named in the preface of Perry's ''Common-law Pleading: its history and principles'' (Boston, 1897)[http://www.lawfulpath.com/ref/commonlawpleadin00perr.pdf] or [https://kateofgaia.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/handbook-of-common-law-pleadings1.pdf ''Handbook of Common Law Pleading, Koffler and Reppy, 1969, online'']&lt;/ref&gt; To initiate a lawsuit, a pleading had to be drafted to meet myriad technical requirements: correctly categorizing the case into the correct legal pigeonhole (pleading in the alternative was not permitted), and using specific "magic words" encrusted over the centuries. Under the old common law pleading standards, a suit by a ''pro se'' ("for oneself," without a lawyer) party was all but impossible, and there was often considerable procedural jousting at the outset of a case over minor wording issues.

One of the major reforms of the late 19th century and early 20th century was the abolition of common law pleading requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Note that the remainder of the "common law" discussed in the rest of the article remained intact; all that was abolished were the highly technical requirements for language of the paper provided by the plaintiff to the defendant to initiate a case.&lt;/ref&gt; A plaintiff can initiate a case by giving the defendant "a short and plain statement" of facts that constitute an alleged wrong.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 4, a complaint must contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."&lt;/ref&gt; This reform moved the attention of courts from technical scrutiny of words to a more rational consideration of the facts, and opened access to justice far more broadly.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 1, civil procedure rules "should be construed, administered, and employed by the court and the parties to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives to common law systems ==

=== Civil law systems--comparisons and contrasts to common law{{anchor|Contrasts between common law and civil law systems}} ===
[[File:Corpus Iuris Civilis 02.jpg|thumb|A 16th century edition of ''Corpus Juris Civilis Romani'' (1583)]]

The main alternative to the common law system is the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, which is used in [[Continental Europe]], and most of the rest of the world.

==== Judicial decisions play only a minor role in shaping civil law ====
The primary contrast between the two systems is the role of written decisions and precedent.

In common law jurisdictions, nearly every case that presents a ''bona fide'' disagreement on the law is resolved in a written opinion. The legal reasoning for the decision, known as ''[[ratio decidendi]]'', not only determines the court's judgment between the parties, but also stands as precedent for resolving future disputes. In contrast, civil law decisions typically do not include explanatory opinions, and thus no precedent flows from one decision to the next.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, H. Law, Liberty and the Constitution: A Brief History of the common Law (2018)&lt;/ref&gt;
In common law systems, a single decided case is binding [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law (connotation 1)]] to the same extent as statute or regulation, under the principle of ''stare decisis''. In contrast, in civil law systems, individual decisions have only advisory, not binding effect. In civil law systems, case law only acquires weight when a long series of cases use consistent reasoning, called ''[[jurisprudence constante]]''. Civil law lawyers consult case law to obtain their best prediction of how a court will rule, but comparatively, civil law judges are less bound to follow it.

For that reason, statutes in civil law systems are more comprehensive, detailed, and continuously updated, covering all matters capable of being brought before a court.&lt;ref&gt;''The Common Law and Civil Law Traditions'', Robbins Collection, University of California at Berkeley.[https://www.law.berkeley.edu/library/robbins/CommonLawCivilLawTraditions.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Adversarial system vs. inquisitorial system ====
[[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|Common law systems]] tend to give more weight to separation of powers between the judicial branch and the executive branch. In contrast, civil law systems are typically more tolerant of allowing individual officials to exercise both powers.  One example of this contrast is the difference between the two systems in allocation of responsibility between prosecutor and adjudicator.&lt;ref name="LawteacherInquisitorialAdversarial"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawteacher.net/free-law-essays/constitutional-law/inquisitorial-and-adversarial-system-of-law-constitutional-law-essay.php|title=Inquisitorial And Adversarial System Of Law|website=lawteacher.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PortsmouthAdversarialInquisitory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://compass.port.ac.uk/UoP/file/c7ffec37-0632-475f-84ba-ae018a2f0f38/1/Types_of_law_IMSLRN.zip/page_10.htm|title=Types of Legal System: Adversarial v. Investigatory Trial Systems|first=|last=LangstoT|website=compass.port.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common law courts usually use an [[adversarial system]], in which two sides present their cases to a neutral judge.&lt;ref name="LawteacherInquisitorialAdversarial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PortsmouthAdversarialInquisitory" /&gt; In contrast, in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, criminal proceedings proceed under an [[inquisitorial system]] in which an examining magistrate serves two roles by developing the evidence and arguments for one side and then the other during the investigation phase.&lt;ref name="LawteacherInquisitorialAdversarial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PortsmouthAdversarialInquisitory" /&gt;

The examining magistrate then presents the dossier detailing his or her findings to the president of the bench that will adjudicate on the case where it has been decided that a trial shall be conducted. Therefore, the president of the bench's view of the case is not neutral and may be biased while conducting the trial after the reading of the dossier. Unlike the common law proceedings, the president of the bench in the inquisitorial system is not merely an umpire and is entitled to directly interview the witnesses or express comments during the trial, as long as he or she does not express his or her view on the guilt of the accused.

The proceeding in the inquisitorial system is essentially by writing. Most of the witnesses would have given evidence in the investigation phase and such evidence will be contained in the dossier under the form of police reports. In the same way, the accused would have already put his or her case at the investigation phase but he or she will be free to change her or his evidence at trial. Whether the accused pleads guilty or not, a trial will be conducted. Unlike the adversarial system, the conviction and sentence to be served (if any) will be released by the trial jury together with the president of the trial bench, following their common deliberation.

There are many exceptions in both directions. For example, most proceedings before U.S. federal and state agencies are inquisitorial in nature, at least the initial stages (''e.g.'', a patent examiner, a social security hearing officer, and so on), even though the law to be applied is developed through common law processes.

==== Contrasting role of treatises and academic writings in common law and civil law systems{{anchor|CL academic writings}} ====
The role of the legal academy presents a significant "cultural" difference between common law ([[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|connotation 2]]) and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions.  In both systems, treatises compile decisions and state overarching principles that (in the author's opinion) explain the results of the cases.  In neither system are treatises considered "law," but the weight given them is nonetheless quite different.

In common law jurisdictions, lawyers and judges tend to use these treatises as only "finding aids" to locate the relevant cases. In common law jurisdictions, scholarly work is seldom cited as authority for what the law is.&lt;ref&gt;At least in the U.S., practicing lawyers tend to use "law professor" or "law review article" as a pejorative to describe a person or work that is insufficiently grounded in reality or practicality—every young lawyer is admonished repeatedly by senior lawyers not to write "law review articles," but instead to focus on the facts of the case and the practical effects of a given outcome.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chief Justice Roberts noted the "great disconnect between the academy and the profession."&lt;ref&gt;A Conversation with Chief Justice Roberts, June 11, 2011 [https://www.c-span.org/video/?300203-1/conversation-chief-justice-roberts] at 30:30.&lt;/ref&gt; When common law courts rely on scholarly work, it is almost always only for factual findings, policy justification, or the [[Legal history|history and evolution of the law]], but the court's legal conclusion is reached through analysis of relevant statutes and common law, seldom scholarly commentary.

In contrast, in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, courts give the writings of [[law school|law professors]] significant weight, partly because civil law decisions traditionally were very brief, sometimes no more than a paragraph stating who wins and who loses. The rationale had to come from somewhere else: the academy often filled that role.

==== Narrowing of differences between common law and civil law ====
The contrast between civil law and common law legal systems has become increasingly blurred, with the growing importance of [[jurisprudence]] (similar to [[case law]] but not binding) in civil law countries, and the growing importance of statute law and codes in common law countries.

Examples of common law being replaced by statute or codified rule in the United States include [[Common law offence#United States|criminal law]] (since 1812,&lt;ref name="USvHudson" /&gt; U.S. federal courts and most but not all of the States have held that criminal law must be embodied in statute if the public is to have fair notice), [[commercial law]] (the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] in the early 1960s) and procedure (the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] in the 1930s and the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] in the 1970s). But note that in each case, the statute sets the general principles, but the [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|interstitial common law]] process determines the scope and application of the statute.

An example of convergence from the other direction is shown in the 1982 decision ''Srl CILFIT and Lanificio di Gavardo SpA v Ministry of Health'' ({{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1982:335}}), in which the [[European Court of Justice]] held that questions it has already answered need not be resubmitted. This showed how a historically distinctly common law principle is used by a court composed of judges (at that time) of essentially civil law jurisdiction.

=== Other alternatives ===

The former [[Soviet Bloc]] and other Socialist countries used a [[Socialist law]] system.

Much of the [[Muslim world]] uses [[Sharia]] (also called [[Sharia|Islamic law]]).

== Common law legal systems in the present day ==
=== In jurisdictions around the world ===
The common law constitutes the basis of the legal systems of:
* [[Law of Australia|Australia]] (both federal and individual states),
* [[Law of Bangladesh|Bangladesh]],
* [[Belize]],
* Brunei,
* Canada (both [[Common law#CL Canada federal|federal]] and the [[Common law#CL Canada provinces|individual provinces]] (except Quebec)),
* the Caribbean jurisdictions of Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Bahamas, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Trinidad and Tobago,

* United States (both the [[Common law#CL United States federal|federal]] system and the individual [[Common law#CL United States|states]] (with the partial exception of [[Common law#Louisiana (1700s)|Louisiana]])),

and many other generally [[English-speaking countries]] or [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries (except the UK's [[Common law#CL Scotland|Scotland]], which is [[bijuridicial law|bijuridicial]], and [[Malta]]). Essentially, every country that was colonised at some time by England, Great Britain, or the United Kingdom uses common law except those that were formerly colonised by other nations, such as [[Law of Quebec|Quebec]] (which follows the [[bijuridicial law|law]] of France in part), South Africa and Sri Lanka (which follow [[Common law#CL Roman Dutch|Roman Dutch law]]), where the prior civil law system was retained to respect the [[civil rights]] of the local colonists. Guyana and Saint Lucia have mixed Common Law and Civil Law systems.

The remainder of this section discusses jurisdiction-specific variants, arranged chronologically.

=== Scotland{{anchor|CL Scotland}} ===
[[Scotland]] is often said to use the civil law system, but it has [[Scots law|a unique system]] that combines elements of an uncodified civil law dating back to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] with an element of its own common law long predating the [[Act of Union (1707)|Treaty of Union]] with England in 1707 (see [[Legal institutions of Scotland in the High Middle Ages]]), founded on the customary laws of the tribes residing there. Historically, [[Scots Law|Scottish common law]] differed in that the use of ''precedent'' was subject to the courts' seeking to discover the principle that justifies a law rather than searching for an example as a ''precedent'',&lt;ref&gt;Stair Memorial Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; and principles of [[natural justice]] and fairness have always played a role in Scots Law. From the 19th century, the Scottish approach to precedent developed into a ''stare decisis'' akin to that already established in England thereby reflecting a narrower, more modern approach to the application of case law in subsequent instances. This is not to say that the substantive rules of the common laws of both countries are the same although in many matters (particularly those of UK-wide interest) they are similar.

Scotland shares the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], with England, Wales and Northern Ireland for civil cases; the court's decisions are binding on the jurisdiction from which a case arises but only influential on similar cases arising in Scotland. This has had the effect of converging the law in certain areas. For instance, the modern UK [[negligence|law of negligence]] is based on ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'', a case originating in Paisley, Scotland.

Scotland maintains a separate criminal law system from the rest of the UK, with the [[High Court of Justiciary]] being the final court for criminal appeals. The highest court of appeal in civil cases brought in Scotland is now the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] (before October 2009, final appellate jurisdiction lay with the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/about/role-of-the-supreme-court.html|title=Role of The Supreme Court – The Supreme Court|first=The Supreme|last=Court|website=www.supremecourt.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
==== States of the United States (17th century on){{anchor|CL United States}} ====
The centuries-old authority of the common law courts in England to develop law case by case and to apply statute law&lt;ref name="William Burnham 2006" /&gt;—"legislating from the bench"— is a traditional function of courts, which was carried over into the U.S. system as an essential component of the "judicial power" specified by Article III of the U.S. constitution.&lt;ref name="GeneralCommonLaw_w_NoStatute" /&gt; Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] summarized centuries of history in 1917, "judges do and must legislate” (in the federal courts, only interstitially, in state courts, to the full limits of common law adjudicatory authority).&lt;ref name="HolmesSouthernPacificLegislate" /&gt;

===== New York (17th century) =====
The state of [[New York (state)|New York]], which also has a civil law history from its [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch colonial]] days, began a [[Codification (law)|codification]] of its law in the 19th century. The only part of this codification process that was considered complete is known as the [[Field Code]] applying to [[civil procedure]]. The original colony of [[New Netherland]] was settled by the Dutch and the law was also Dutch. When the English captured pre-existing colonies they continued to allow the local settlers to keep their civil law. However, the Dutch settlers revolted against the English and the colony was [[Second Anglo-Dutch War|recaptured]] by the Dutch. When the English finally regained control of New Netherland they forced, as a punishment unique in the history of the British Empire, the English imposed common law upon all the colonists, including the Dutch. This was problematic, as the [[patroon]] system of land holding, based on the [[Feudalism|feudal system]] and civil law, continued to operate in the colony until it was abolished in the mid-19th century. The influence of [[Roman-Dutch law]] continued in the colony well into the late 19th century. The codification of a law of general obligations shows how remnants of the civil law tradition in New York continued on from the Dutch days.

===== Louisiana (1700s){{anchor|Louisiana (1700s)}} =====

Under [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana's codified system]], the [[Louisiana Civil Code]], private law—that is, [[substantive law]] between private sector parties—is based on principles of law from continental Europe, with some common law influences. These principles derive ultimately from [[Roman law]], transmitted through [[Law of France|French law]] and [[Law of Spain|Spanish law]], as the state's current territory intersects the area of North America colonized by Spain and by France. Contrary to popular belief, the Louisiana code does not directly derive from the [[Napoleonic Code]], as the latter was enacted in 1804, one year after the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. However, the two codes are similar in many respects due to common roots.

Louisiana's [[criminal law]] largely rests on English common law. Louisiana's [[administrative law]] is generally similar to the [[administrative Procedure Act (United States)|administrative law of the U.S. federal government]] and other U.S. states. Louisiana's [[procedural law]] is generally in line with that of other U.S. states, which in turn is generally based on the U.S. [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]].

Historically notable among the Louisiana code's differences from common law is the role of property rights among women, particularly in inheritance gained by widows.

===== California (1850s) =====
The [[U.S. state]] of [[California]] has a system based on common law, but it has [[Codification (law)|codified]] the law in the manner of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. The reason for the enactment of the [[California Codes]] in the 19th century was to replace a pre-existing system based on Spanish civil law with a system based on common law, similar to that in most other states. California and a number of other [[Western United States|Western states]], however, have retained the concept of [[community property]] derived from civil law. The California courts have treated portions of the codes as an extension of the common-law tradition, subject to judicial development in the same manner as judge-made common law. (Most notably, in the case ''[[Li v. Yellow Cab Co.]]'', 13 Cal.3d 804 (1975), the [[California Supreme Court]] adopted the principle of [[comparative negligence]] in the face of a [[California Civil Code]] provision codifying the traditional common-law doctrine of [[contributory negligence]].)

==== United States federal courts (1789 and 1938){{anchor|CL United States federal}} ====
[[File:Uscatitle11.jpg|thumb|USCA: some annotated volumes of the [[United States Code|official compilation]] and codification of federal statutes.]]

The United States federal government (as opposed to the states) has a variant on a common law system. [[United States federal courts]] only act as interpreters of statutes and the constitution by elaborating and precisely defining broad statutory language ([[Common law#Disambiguate statute|connotation 1(b)]] above), but, unlike state courts, do not act as an independent source of common law.

Before 1938, the federal courts, like almost all other common law courts, decided the law on any issue where the relevant legislature (either the U.S. Congress or state legislature, depending on the issue), had not acted, by looking to courts in the same system, that is, other federal courts, even on issues of state law, and even where there was no express grant of authority from Congress or the Constitution.

In 1938, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins]]'' [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=304&amp;page=64 304 U.S. 64, 78] (1938), overruled earlier precedent,&lt;ref&gt;''Swift v. Tyson'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=41&amp;page=1 41 U.S. 1] (1842). In ''Swift'', the [[United States Supreme Court]] had held that federal courts hearing cases brought under their [[diversity jurisdiction]] (allowing them to hear cases between parties from different states) had to apply the statutory law of the states, but not the common law developed by state courts. Instead, the Supreme Court permitted the federal courts to make their own common law based on general principles of law. ''Erie v. Tompkins'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=304&amp;page=64 304 U.S. 64] (1938). ''Erie'' overruled ''Swift v. Tyson'', and instead held that federal courts exercising diversity jurisdiction had to use all of the same [[substantive law]] as the courts of the states in which they were located. As the ''Erie'' Court put it, there is no "general federal common law", the key word here being '''''general'''''. This history is elaborated in
[[federal common law]].&lt;/ref&gt; and held "There is no federal general common law," thus confining the federal courts to act only as interpreters of law originating elsewhere. ''E.g.'', ''Texas Industries v. Radcliff'', {{ussc|451|630|1981}} (without an express grant of statutory authority, federal courts cannot create rules of intuitive justice, for example, a right to contribution from co-conspirators). Post-1938, federal courts deciding issues that arise under state law are required to defer to state court interpretations of state statutes, or reason what a state's highest court would rule if presented with the issue, or to certify the question to the state's highest court for resolution.

Later courts have limited ''Erie'' slightly, to create a few situations where [[United States federal courts]] are permitted to create [[federal common law]] rules without express statutory authority, for example, where a federal rule of decision is necessary to protect uniquely federal interests, such as foreign affairs, or financial instruments issued by the federal government. ''See, e.g.'', ''[[Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States]]'', {{ussc|318|363|1943}} (giving federal courts the authority to fashion common law rules with respect to issues of federal power, in this case [[negotiable instrument]]s backed by the federal government); ''see also'' ''[[International News Service v. Associated Press]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=248&amp;page=215 248 U.S. 215] (1918) (creating a cause of action for misappropriation of "hot news" that lacks any statutory grounding); ''but see National Basketball Association v. Motorola, Inc.'', 105 F.3d 841, 843–44, 853 (2d Cir. 1997) (noting continued vitality of ''INS'' "hot news" tort under New York state law, but leaving open the question of whether it survives under federal law). Except on Constitutional issues, Congress is free to legislatively overrule federal courts' common law.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Boerne v. Flores'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=521&amp;invol=507 521 U.S. 507] (1997) (invalidating the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]], in which Congress had attempted to redefine the court's jurisdiction to decide constitutional issues); ''Milwaukee v. Illinois'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=451&amp;invol=304 451 U.S. 304] (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United States executive branch agencies (1946) ====
Most executive branch agencies in the United States federal government have some adjudicatory authority. To greater or lesser extent, agencies honor their own precedent to ensure consistent results. Agency decision making is governed by the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] of 1946.

For example, the [[National Labor Relations Board]] issues relatively few [[regulations]], but instead promulgates most of its substantive rules through [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law (connotation 1)]].

=== India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh (19th century and 1948){{anchor|CL India and Pakistan}} ===
The law of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are largely based on [[English law|English]] common law because of the long period of [[British Empire|British colonial influence]] during the period of the [[British India|British Raj]].

[[History of India|Ancient India]] represented a distinct tradition of law, and had an historically independent school of legal theory and practice. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'', dating from 400 BCE and the ''[[Manusmriti]]'', from 100 CE, were influential treatises in India, texts that were considered authoritative legal guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]'s central philosophy was tolerance and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], and was cited across [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in this period, which finally culminated in the creation of the [[Gupta Empire]], relations with ancient Greece and Rome were not infrequent. The appearance of similar fundamental institutions of international law in various parts of the world show that they are inherent in international society, irrespective of culture and tradition.{{sfn|Alexander|1952|pp=289–300}} Inter-State relations in the pre-Islamic period resulted in clear-cut rules of warfare of a high humanitarian standard, in rules of neutrality, of treaty law, of customary law embodied in religious charters, in exchange of embassies of a temporary or semi-permanent character.&lt;ref&gt;Viswanatha, S.T., ''International Law in Ancient India'', 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

When India became part of the [[British Empire]], there was a break in tradition, and Hindu and Islamic law were supplanted by the common law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the failed [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion]] against the British in 1857, the [[British Parliament]] took over control of India from the [[British East India Company]], and [[British India]] came under the direct rule of [[the Crown]]. The British Parliament passed the [[Government of India Act 1858|Government of India Act of 1858]] to this effect, which set up the structure of British government in India.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/393/ |title = Official, India |work = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1890–1923 |accessdate = 2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It established in Britain the office of the [[Secretary of State for India]] through whom the Parliament would exercise its rule, along with a [[Council of India]] to aid him. It also established the office of the [[Governor-General of India]] along with an Executive Council in India, which consisted of high officials of the British Government. As a result, the present judicial system of the country derives largely from the British system and has little correlation to the institutions of the pre-British era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jain|2006|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify-inline|date=August 2015}}

Legislation first introduced by the British is still in effect in modified form today. During the drafting of the [[Indian Constitution]], laws from Ireland, the United States, Britain, and France were all synthesized to produce a refined set of Indian laws. Indian laws also adhere to the [[United Nations]] guidelines on [[human rights law]] and [[environmental law]]. Certain [[international trade law]]s, such as those on [[intellectual property]], are also enforced in India.

The exception to this rule is in the state of [[Goa]], annexed in stages in the 1960s through 1980s. In Goa, a Portuguese [[uniform civil code]] is in place, in which all religions have a common law regarding marriages, divorces and adoption.

The division of [[jurisdiction]] between the federal and provincial Parliaments is specified in the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-5.html#anchorbo-ga:s_91-gb:s_91 Constitution Act, 1867], s. 91(10), (18)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canadian provincial law{{anchor|CL Canada provinces}} ====

Each [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province and territory]] is considered a separate jurisdiction with respect to common law matters. As such, only the provincial legislature may enact legislation to amend private law. Each has its own procedural law, statutorily created provincial courts and superior trial courts with inherent jurisdiction culminating in the Court of Appeal of the province. This is the highest court in provincial jurisdiction, only subject to the Supreme Court of Canada in terms of appeal of their decisions. All but one of the provinces of [[Law of Canada|Canada]] use a common law system (the exception being [[Law of Quebec|Quebec]], which uses a French-heritage civil law system for issues arising within provincial jurisdiction, such as property ownership and contracts).

==== Canadian federal law{{anchor|CL Canada federal}} ====

Canadian Federal Courts operate under a separate system throughout Canada and deal with narrower subject matter than superior courts in provincial jurisdiction. They hear cases reserved for federal jurisdiction by the Canadian constitution, such as immigration, intellectual property, judicial review of federal government decisions, and admiralty. The [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] is the appellate level court in federal jurisdiction and hears cases in multiple cities, and unlike the United States, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal is not divided into appellate circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fca-caf.gc.ca/index_e.shtml |title=Federal Court of Appeal – Home |publisher=Fca-caf.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal law is uniform throughout Canada. It is based on the constitution and federal statutory Criminal Code, as interpreted by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. The administration of justice and enforcement of the criminal code are the responsibilities of the provinces.

Canadian federal statutes must use the terminology of both the common law and civil law for those matters; this is referred to as legislative bijuralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canada.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/harmonization/bijurilex/aboutb-aproposb.html|title=Department of Justice – About Bijuralism|first=Government of Canada, Department of Justice, Legislative Services|last=Branch|website=canada.justice.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nicaragua ===
[[Nicaragua]]'s legal system is also a mixture of the English Common Law and Civil Law.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} This situation was brought through the influence of British administration of the Eastern half of the [[Mosquito Coast]] from the mid-17th century until about 1894, the [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] period from about 1855 through 1857, USA interventions/occupations during the period from 1909 to 1933, the influence of USA institutions during the [[Somoza family]] administrations (1933 through 1979) and the considerable importation between 1979 and the present of USA culture and institutions.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Israel (1948){{anchor|CL Israel}} ===
[[Israeli law|Israel]] has a common law legal system. Its basic principles are inherited from the law of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]] and thus resemble those of British and American law, namely: the role of courts in creating the body of law and the authority of the [[Supreme Court of Israel|supreme court]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lawofisrael.com/israeli-supreme-court-decisions | title=Supreme court decisions database}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reviewing and if necessary overturning legislative and executive decisions, as well as employing the adversarial system. One of the primary reasons that the [[Constitution of Israel|Israeli constitution]] remains [[unwritten constitution|unwritten]] is the fear by whatever party holds power that creating a written constitution, combined with the common-law elements, would severely limit the powers of the [[Knesset]] (which, following the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], holds near-unlimited power).{{sfn|Mahler|2004|p=126}}

=== Roman Dutch Common law{{anchor|CL Roman Dutch}} ===
[[Roman Dutch law|Roman Dutch Common law]] is a bijuridical or mixed system of law similar to the common law system in [[Scotland]] and [[Common law#Louisiana (1700s)|Louisiana]]. Roman Dutch common law jurisdictions include [[Law of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Botswana]], [[Lesotho]], [[Namibia]], [[Swaziland]], [[Sri-Lanka]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. Many of these jurisdictions recognise customary law, and in some, such as South Africa the Constitution requires that the common law be developed in accordance with the Bill of Rights. Roman Dutch common law is a development of [[Roman Dutch law]] by courts in the Roman Dutch common law jurisdictions. During the Napoleonic wars the Kingdom of the Netherlands adopted the French ''code civil'' in 1809, however the Dutch colonies in the Cape of Good Hope and Sri Lanka, at the time called Ceylon, were seized by the British to prevent them being used as bases by the French Navy. The system was developed by the courts and spread with the expansion of British colonies in Southern Africa. Roman Dutch common law relies on legal principles set out in Roman law sources such as Justinian's Institutes and Digest, and also on the writing of Dutch jurists of the 17th century such as [[Hugo Grotius|Grotius]] and [[Johannes Voet|Voet]]. In practice, the majority of decisions rely on recent precedent.

=== Ghana ===
Ghana follows the English common-law&lt;ref&gt;The common law as used in this paper designates the English common-law as a legal tradition which is made up of law (generally referred to as the common law), and the doctrine of equity.&lt;/ref&gt; tradition which was inherited from the British during her colonisation. Consequently, the laws of Ghana are, for the most part, a modified version of imported law that is continuously adapting to changing socio-economic and political realities of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Obiri-Korang P "Private international law of contract in Ghana: the need for a paradigm shift" (2017) P 8; Quansah ''The Ghana Legal System'' (2011) P 51&lt;/ref&gt; The Bond of 184&lt;ref&gt;The Bond was a pact between the British and some chiefs from the southern states of the Gold Coast under which British protection was extended to the signatories in exchange for judicial authority over them.&lt;/ref&gt; 4 was the first most important event in the history of Ghana (then Gold Coast) that marked the critical period when the people ceded their independence to the British&lt;ref&gt;See, generally, Benion ''The Constitutional Law of Ghana'' (1962). Boahen, however, submits that the Bond of 1844 is not as important as held by some Ghanaian historians. He further posits that it cannot be the Mgna Carta of Ghana or the basis for British rule or law – see Boahen ''Ghana: Evolution and Change in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Century'' (1975) 36.&lt;/ref&gt; and gave the British judicial authority. Later, the Supreme Court Ordinance of 1876 “formally” introduced British law, be it the common law or statutory law, in the Gold Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Asante “Over a hundred years of a national legal system in Ghana: a review and critique” 1988 ''Journal of African Law'' 31 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 14&lt;ref&gt;This states that “the common law, the doctrines of equity, and Statutes of general application which were in force in England at the date when the colony obtained a local legislature, that is to say, on the 24th of July 1874, shall be in force within the jurisdiction of the court”.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Ordinance formalised the application of the common-law tradition in the country.

Ghana, after independence, did not do away with the common law system inherited from the British, and today it has been enshrined in the 1992 Constitution of the country. Chapter four of Ghana's Constitution, entitled “The Laws of Ghana”, has in Article 11(1) the list of laws applicable in the state. This comprises (a) the Constitution; (b) enactments made by or under the authority of the Parliament established by the Constitution; (c) any Orders, Rules and Regulations made by any person or authority under a power conferred by the Constitution; (d) the existing law; and (e) the common law.&lt;ref&gt;According to Article 11(2) of Ghana’s Constitution, the common law of Ghana shall comprise the rule of law generally known as the common law, the rules generally known as the doctrine of equity and the rules of customary law, including those determined by the Superior Court of Judicature.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the modern-day Constitution of Ghana, like those before it, embraced the English common law by entrenching it in its provisions. The doctrine of judicial precedence which is based on the principle of ''stare decisis'' as applied in England and other pure common law countries also applies in Ghana.

== Scholarly works ==
[[File:WilliamBlackstone.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sir William Blackstone]] as illustrated in his ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]''.]]
[[Edward Coke]], a 17th-century Lord Chief Justice of the English Court of Common Pleas and a [[Member of Parliament]], wrote several legal texts that collected and integrated centuries of case law. Lawyers in both England and America learned the law from his ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England|Institutes]]'' and ''Reports'' until the end of the 18th century. His works are still cited by common law courts around the world.

The next definitive historical treatise on the common law is ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', written by Sir [[William Blackstone]] and first published in 1765–1769. Since 1979, a facsimile edition of that first edition has been available in four paper-bound volumes. Today it has been superseded in the English part of the United Kingdom by [[Halsbury's Laws of England]] that covers both common and statutory English law.

While he was still on the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]], and before being named to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] published a short volume called ''[[The Common Law (Holmes)|The Common Law]]'', which remains a classic in the field. Unlike Blackstone and the Restatements, Holmes' book only briefly discusses what the law ''is''; rather, Holmes describes the common law ''process''. Law professor [[John Chipman Gray]]'s ''The Nature and Sources of the Law'', an examination and survey of the common law, is also still commonly read in [[Law school in the United States|U.S. law schools]].

In the United States, [[Restatement of the Law|Restatements]] of various subject matter areas (Contracts, Torts, Judgments, and so on.), edited by the [[American Law Institute]], collect the common law for the area. The ALI Restatements are often cited by American courts and lawyers for propositions of uncodified common law, and are considered highly persuasive authority, just below binding precedential decisions. The [[Corpus Juris Secundum]] is an encyclopedia whose main content is a compendium of the common law and its variations throughout the various state jurisdictions.

Scots ''common law'' covers matters including murder and theft, and has sources in custom, in legal writings and previous court decisions. The legal writings used are called ''Institutional Texts'' and come mostly from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Examples include Craig, ''Jus Feudale'' (1655) and Stair, ''The Institutions of the Law of Scotland'' (1681).

Founded in 1954, CEF is a non profit US-American membership organization based in Buffalo (New York).

==History==
The organization was established in 1954 by the advertising specialist and creative professional [[Alex F. Osborn]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativeeducationfoundation.org/about-us/brief-history CEF website: History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502053825/http://creativeeducationfoundation.org/about-us/brief-history |date=2013-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was known as the inventor of the term and the [[creativity technique]] of [[Brainstorming]]. As an early contribution according to its mission statement the organization held in 1955 the first annual Creative Problem Solving Institute (CPSI), an international creativity conference, at the [[University of Buffalo]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040903161948/http://www.buffalostate.edu/orgs/cbir/readingroom/html/Sharkey-Januale-99.html ICSC-website]&lt;/ref&gt;

For years the organization had been directed by Alex Osborn together with the creativity theorist and education researcher [[Sid Parnes]]. When Alex Osborn died in 1966, Parnes took over the initiative and the chair. He installed the lifetime creative achievement award which was granted upon suggestion to persons who earned outstanding merits in the field of applied creativity. Also he installed a media-program of CEF-publications.

In 1987 John Meyerhoff took over as the CEO. He expanded CEF’s educational perspective to include business training.

Further CEOs added partnership programs and VIP-days and reinstalled CEF consulting and training programs.

==Work==
In the beginning the focus relied on organizing the annual conference, evolving and applying creativity tools and techniques which can be used professionally and personally, conducting research in the field of applied creativity, problem solving and innovation, publishing books and teaching materials, and in the development of a comprehensive educational program which includes creativity specifically for scholars and young people.

As a part of its research aspirations, in 1967, the organization launched  the [[Journal of Creative Behavior| Journal of Creative Behavior (JCB)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)2162-6057|title=The Journal of Creative Behavior|journal=The Journal of Creative Behavior|publisher=|doi=10.1002/(issn)2162-6057}}&lt;/ref&gt; a peer-reviewed first research publication devoted to the science of creativity, published by [[Wiley-Blackwell]]. Later, in 1972 it was followed by Creativity in Action, CEF’s monthly newsletter.

Since 1979 the CPSI-conference has offered four major program streams: Springboard for novices, Leadership Development Program, CPSI YouthWise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mycoted.com/Creative_Education_Foundation|title=Creative Education Foundation - Mycoted|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Extending sessions for exploratory studies.

Since 1989 the organization sponsored creativity conferences in the CPSI-sense on different continents promote creativity and creative education; it started with the first Australian CPSI &lt;!-- no specific date found yet--&gt; and was later followed by the South African ACRE-conference (since 1994) and the European CREA-conference (since 2003).

In 2003 the CEF YouthWise-program was launched in South Africa, and in 2011 the Creativity in the 21st Century Classroom course enhanced the CPSI program.

Today the goals of CEF span a range of fostering creativity and giftedness including dialogue, serious play and training programs, conferences, programs, publications and other services in order to pursue the idea of creativity as human capacity which can be developed and nurtured.&lt;ref name="creativeeducationfoundation.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativeeducationfoundation.org/|title=Creative Education Foundation - Creating Innovative Thinkers.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The CPS Process==
Central to the Creative Education Foundation is their belief in the CPS Process. The steps are clarify, ideate, develop and implement; while the core principles include convergent and divergent thinking must be balanced, ask problems as questions, suspend judgement, and focus on "yes and..." rather than "no, but...". &lt;ref name="creativeeducationfoundation.org"/&gt;

==Research==
'''The Journal of Creative Behavior:'''
CEF publishes a quarterly academic citing research in creative thinking titled, ''"The Journal of Creative Behavior"''. Edited by  Ronald A. Beghetto  from the [[University of Connecticut]], the journal deals with methods to foster creative productivity, giftedness, management of creative personnel, testing, creativity in business and industry, development of creative curricula, creativity in the arts and sciences, and reviews of literature on creativity and problem solving. The content also focuses on the creative process. After self-publishing 45 volumes since 1967, the Journal of Creative Behavior moved to [[Wiley-Blackwell]], a commercial publisher of academic journals.&lt;ref name="creativeeducationfoundation.org"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10121">In [[mathematics]], the '''curve complex''' is a [[simplicial complex]] ''C''(''S'') associated to a finite type [[Surface (topology)|surface]]  S, which encodes the combinatorics of [[simple closed curve]]s on&amp;nbsp;''S''. The curve complex turned out to be a fundamental tool in the study of the geometry of the Teichmüller space, of mapping class groups and of Kleinian groups.

== Curve complexes ==

=== Definition ===

Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a finite type connected oriented surface. More specifically, let &lt;math&gt;S=S_{g,b,n}&lt;/math&gt; be a connected oriented surface of genus &lt;math&gt;g\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;b\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; boundary components and &lt;math&gt;n\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; punctures.

The ''curve complex''  &lt;math&gt;C(S)&lt;/math&gt; is the simplicial complex defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Farb and Margalit, Ch. 4.1, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

*The vertices are the free [[homotopy class]]es of essential (neither homotopically trivial nor peripheral) simple closed curves on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;;
*If &lt;math&gt;c_1, \ldots, c_n&lt;/math&gt; represent distinct vertices of &lt;math&gt;C(S)&lt;/math&gt;, they span a simplex if and only if they can be homotoped to be pairwise disjoint.

=== Examples ===

For surfaces of small complexity (essentially the [[torus]], punctured torus, and four-holed sphere), with the definition above the curve complex has infinitely many connected components. One can give an alternate and more useful definition by joining vertices if the corresponding curves have minimal intersection number. With this alternate definition, the resulting complex is isomorphic to the [[Farey graph]].

== Geometry of the curve complex ==

=== Basic properties ===

If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a compact surface of genus &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; boundary components the dimension of &lt;math&gt;C(S)&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;\xi(S) = 3g - 3 + b&lt;/math&gt;. In what follows, we will assume that &lt;math&gt;\xi(S) \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;. The complex of curves is never locally finite (i.e. every vertex has infinitely many neighbors). A result of Harer &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harer|first=John L.|date=1986-02-01|title=The virtual cohomological dimension of the mapping class group of an orientable surface|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01388737|journal=Inventiones mathematicae|language=en|volume=84|issue=1|pages=157–176|doi=10.1007/BF01388737|issn=0020-9910|bibcode=1986InMat..84..157H}}&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that &lt;math&gt;C(S)&lt;/math&gt; is in fact it is [[Homotopy equivalence|homotopically equivalent]] to a [[wedge sum]] of spheres.

=== Intersection numbers and distance on ''C''(''S'') ===

The combinatorial distance on the 1-skeleton of &lt;math&gt;C(S)&lt;/math&gt; is related to the intersection number between simple closed curves on a surface, which is the smallest number of intersections of two curves in the isotopy classes. For example{{sfn|Schleimer|2006|loc=Lemma 1.21}}

: &lt;math&gt;d_S (\alpha, \beta) \le 2 \log_2 (i(\alpha, \beta)) + 2&lt;/math&gt;

for any two nondisjoint simple closed curves &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta&lt;/math&gt;. One can compare in the other direction but the results are much more subtle (for example there is no uniform lower bound even for a given surface) and harder to prove.{{sfn|Bowditch|2006}}

=== Hyperbolicity===

It was proved by [[Howard Masur|Masur]] and [[Yair Minsky|Minsky]]{{sfn|Masur|Minsky|1999}} that the complex of curves is a [[Gromov hyperbolic space]]. Later work by various authors gave alternate proofs of this fact and better information on the hyperbolicity.{{sfn|Bowditch|2006}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Aougab | first=Tarik | title=Uniform hyperbolicity of the graphs of curves | journal=Geom. Topol. | volume=17 | date=2013 | pages=2855–2875 | mr=3190300 | doi=10.2140/gt.2013.17.2855| arxiv=1212.3160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation with the mapping class group and Teichmüller space ==

=== Action of the mapping class group ===

The [[mapping class group]] of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; acts on the complex &lt;math&gt;C(S)&lt;/math&gt; in the natural way: it acts on the vertices by &lt;math&gt;\phi\cdot\alpha = \phi_*\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and this extends to an action on the full complex. This action allows to prove many interesting properties of the mapping class groups.{{sfn|Ivanov|1992|loc=Chapter 7}}

While the mapping class group itself is not an [[hyperbolic group]], the fact that &lt;math&gt;C(S)&lt;/math&gt; is hyperbolic still has implications for its structure and geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Manganas | first=Johanna | title=Uniform uniform exponential growth of subgroups of the mapping class group | journal=Geom. Funct. Anal. | volume=19 | date=2010 | pages=1468–1480 | mr=2585580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dahmani|first1=François|last2=Guirardel|first2=Vincent|last3=Osin|first3=Denis|title=Hyperbolically embedded subgroups and rotating families in groups acting on hyperbolic spaces|url=http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/1111.7048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison with Teichmüller space ===

There is a natural map from [[Teichmüller space]] to the curve complex, which takes a marked hyperbolic structures to the collection of closed curves realising the smallest possible length (the [[Systolic geometry|systole]]). It allows to read off certain geometric properties of the latter, in particular it explains the empirical fact that while Teichmüller space itself is not hyperbolic it retains certain features of hyperbolicity.

== Applications to 3-dimensional topology ==

=== Heegaard splittings ===

A simplex in &lt;math&gt;C(S)&lt;/math&gt; determines a "filling" of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to a handlebody. Choosing two simplices in &lt;math&gt;C(S)&lt;/math&gt; thus determines a [[Heegaard splitting]] of a three-manifold,{{sfn|Hempel|2001}} with the additional data of an Heegaard diagram (a maximal system of disjoint simple closed curves bounding disks for each of the two handlebodies). Some properties of Heegaard splittings can be read very efficiently off the relative positions of the simplices:

*the splitting is reducible if and only if it has a diagram represented by simplices which have a common vertex;
*the splitting is weakly reducible if and only if it has a diagram represented by simplices which are linked by an edge.

In general the minimal distance between simplices representing diagram for the splitting can give information on the topology and geometry (in the sense of the [[geometrisation conjecture]] of the manifold) and vice versa.{{sfn|Hempel|2001}} A guiding principle is that the minimal distance of a Heegaard splitting is a measure of the complexity of the manifold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Abrams | first1=Aaron | last2=Schleimer | first2=Saul | title=Distances of Heegaard splittings | journal=Geom. Topol. | volume=9 | date=2005 | pages=95–119 | mr=2115669 | doi=10.2140/gt.2005.9.95| arxiv=math/0306071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kleinian groups ===

As a special case of the philosophy of the previous paragraph, the geometry of the curve complex is an important tool to link combinatorial and geometric propertoes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and hence it is a useful tool in the study of Kleinian groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bowditch | first=Brian H. | chapter=Hyperbolic 3-manifolds and the geometry of the curve complex | title=European Congress of Mathematics | pages=103–115 | publisher=Eur. Math. Soc. | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it has been used in the proof of the [[ending lamination conjecture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Minsky|first=Yair|date=2010|title=The classification of Kleinian surface groups, I: models and bounds|url=http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2010/171-1/p01|journal=Annals of Mathematics|language=en-US|volume=171|issue=1|pages=1–107|doi=10.4007/annals.2010.171.1|issn=0003-486X|arxiv=math/0302208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brock|first=Jeffrey|last2=Canary|first2=Richard|last3=Minsky|first3=Yair|date=2012|title=The classification of Kleinian surface groups, II: The Ending Lamination Conjecture|url=http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2012/176-1/p01|journal=Annals of Mathematics|language=en-US|volume=176|issue=3|pages=1–149|doi=10.4007/annals.2012.176.1.1|issn=0003-486X|arxiv=math/0412006}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Random manifolds ===

A possible model for random 3-manifolds is to take random Heegaard splittings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dunfield | first1=Nathan M. | last2=Thurston | first2=William P. | title=Finite covers of random 3-manifolds | journal=Invent. Math. | volume=166 | date=2006 | pages=457–521 | mr=2257389 | doi=10.1007/s00222-006-0001-6| arxiv=math/0502567 | bibcode=2006InMat.166..457D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proof that this model is hyperbolic almost surely (in a certain sense) uses the geometry of the complex of curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Joseph | last=Maher | title=Random Heegaard splittings | journal=J.

The term '''directed evolution''' is used within the [[transhumanist]] community to refer to the idea of applying the principles of [[directed evolution]] and [[experimental evolution]] to the control of human evolution.&lt;ref name=mehlman&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maxwell|first1=Mehlman|title=Will Directed Evolution Destroy Humanity, and If So, What Can We Do About It?|url=http://www.slu.edu/Documents/law/SLUJHP/Mehlman_Article.pdf|publisher=3 St. Louis U.J. Health L. &amp; Pol'y 93, 96-97 (2009]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210230309/http://www.slu.edu/Documents/law/SLUJHP/Mehlman_Article.pdf|archivedate=2015-12-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, it is distinct from the use of the term in [[biochemistry]], which refers only to the evolution of [[proteins]] and [[RNA]]. Maxwell J. Melhmanh has described directed evolution of humans as the Holy Grail of [[transhumanism]].&lt;ref name = mehlman/&gt;
Oxford philosopher [[Julian Savulescu]] wrote that:
{{Quote
 |quote  = Humanity until this point has been a story of evolution for the survival genes - survival and reproduction ... we are entering a new phase of human evolution—evolution under reason—where human beings are masters of their destiny. Power has been transferred from nature to science.
 |source = [[Julian Savulescu]] &lt;ref name=Savulescu&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savulescu|first1=Julian|title=Human-Animal Transgenesis and Chimeras Might Be an Expression of Our Humanity|journal=Journal of Bioethics|date=2003|volume=3|pages=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

According to [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] biophysicist [[Gregory Stock]]:
{{Quote
 |quote  = Humanity is leaving its childhood and moving into its adolescence as its powers infuse into realms hitherto beyond our reach.
 |source = [[Gregory Stock]] &lt;ref name=gstock&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stock|first1=Gregory|title=Germinal Choice Technology and the Human Future|journal=Ethics L. &amp; Moral Phil. Reprod. Biomedicine|date=2005|volume=10|pages=27–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 |width  = 90%

[[Riccardo Campa]], from the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]], wrote that "self-directed evolution" can be coupled with many different political, philosophical, and religious views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campa|first1=Riccardo|title=Toward a transhumanist politics|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/campa20090622/|website=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the term==
Andrew Askland, from the [[Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law]] claims that referring to [[transhumanism]] as directed evolution is problematic because evolution is ateleological and transhumanism is [[teleological]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Askland|first1=Andrew|title=The Misnomer of Transhumanism as Directed Evolution|journal=International Journal of Emerging Technologies and Society|date=2011|volume=9|issue=1|pages=71–78|url=https://www.law.asu.edu/Portals/31/Askland_transhumanism_IJETS.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227044619/https://www.law.asu.edu/Portals/31/Askland_transhumanism_IJETS.pdf|archivedate=2015-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participant evolution==
Participant evolution is an alternative term that refers to the process of deliberately redesigning the [[human body]] and [[Human brain|brain]] using [[Technology|technological]] means, rather than through the natural processes of [[mutation]] and [[natural selection]], with the goal of removing "biological limitations" and human enhancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=28HEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45|title=Human Nature in an Age of Biotechnology: The Case for Mediated Posthumanism|first=Tamar|last=Sharon|date=11 October 2013|publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=LiOheK_2uZ8C&amp;pg=PA376|title=Biomedicalization: Technoscience, Health, and Illness in the U.S.|first1=Adele E.|last1=Clarke|first2=Laura|last2=Mamo|first3=Jennifer Ruth|last3=Fosket|first4=Jennifer R.|last4=Fishman|first5=Janet K.|last5=Shim|date=1 January 2009|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=WgPHCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT179|title=The Cybernetics Moment: Or Why We Call Our Age the Information Age|first=Ronald R.|last=Kline|date=25 June 2015|publisher=[[JHU Press]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=mZLV5wLbQvAC&amp;pg=PA58|title=Iphigenias at Aulis: Textual Multiplicity, Radical Philology|first=Sean Alexander|last=Gurd|date=1 January 2005|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=WK3Wj2bwHScC&amp;pg=PA169|title=Panic Diaries: A Genealogy of Panic Disorder|first=Jackie|last=Orr|date=8 February 2006|publisher=Duke University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=Ix1HCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7|title=Transcend the Flesh: Transhumanism debate|first=Tobiasz|last=Mazan|date=17 April 2015|publisher=Tobiasz Mazan|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=g7mZw8FSHpwC|title=Beyond Human: From Animality to Transhumanism|first1=Charlie|last1=Blake|first2=Claire|last2=Molloy|first3=Steven|last3=Shakespeare|date=15 March 2012|publisher=[[A&amp;C Black]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=7CIeXt8yIhkC&amp;pg=PA9|title=Frontiers of Cyberspace|first=Daniel|last=Riha|date=28 December 2016|publisher=Rodopi|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=629wC2skzb0C&amp;pg=PA125|title=Rape of the Wild: Man's Violence Against Animals and the Earth|first1=Andrée|last1=Collard|first2=Joyce|last2=Contrucci|date=1 January 1989|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=pDg3jDHDBSUC&amp;pg=PA94|title=Shaw and Science Fiction|first=Milton T.|last=Wolf|date=1 January 1997|publisher=[[Penn State Press]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoundmusic.com/home/microsound/.blogs/post8883/Drugs%2C%20Space%2C%20and%20Cybernetics%3B%20Evolution%20to%20Cyborgs.pdf |date=1961 |title=Drugs, Space, and Cybernetics: Evolution to Cyborgs |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208174752/http://www.microsoundmusic.com/home/microsound/.blogs/post8883/Drugs%2C%20Space%2C%20and%20Cybernetics%3B%20Evolution%20to%20Cyborgs.pdf |archivedate=2016-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Whilst Clynes and Kline saw participant evolution as the process of creating [[cyborg]]s, the idea has been adopted and propounded by [[Transhumanism|transhumanists]] who argue that individuals should have the choice of using [[human enhancement]] technologies on themselves and their children, to progressively become [[transhuman]] and ultimately [[posthuman]], as part of a voluntary regimen of participant evolution.

'''Economic freedom''' or '''economic liberty''' is the ability of people of a society to take economic actions. This is a term used in economic and [[policy debate]]s as well as in the [[philosophy of economics]].&lt;ref name=Bronfenbrenner1955&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bronfenbrenner|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Bronfenbrenner|year=1955|journal=[[Ethics (journal)|Ethics]]|title=Two Concepts of Economic Freedom|volume=65|issue=3|jstor=2378928|pages=157–70 |doi=10.1086/290998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SenRationalityFreedom&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sen|first=Amartya|authorlink=Amartya Sen|title=Rationality and Freedom|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; One approach to economic freedom comes from [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] traditions emphasizing [[free market]]s, [[free trade]], and [[private property]] under free enterprise.

The [[free market]] viewpoint defines economic liberty as the freedom to produce, trade and consume any goods and services acquired without the use of force, fraud or theft. This is embodied in the rule of law, property rights and freedom of contract, and characterized by external and internal openness of the markets, the protection of property rights and freedom of economic initiative.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaPubChoice" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Surjit S.

Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-15342-5}} pp. 57, 64&lt;/ref&gt; There are several [[indices of economic freedom]] that attempt to measure free market economic freedom. Based on these rankings correlative studies have found higher economic growth to be correlated with higher scores on the country rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ayal|first1=Eliezer B.|last2=Karras|first2=Georgios|title=Components of economic freedom and growth: an empirical study|journal=Journal of Developing Areas|volume=32|issue=3|pages=327–38|publisher=Western Illinois University|date=Spring 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=December 2017}} With regards to other measures, such as equality, corruption, political and social violence and their correlation to economic freedom it has been argued that the economic freedom indices conflate unrelated policies and policy outcomes to conceal negative correlations between economic growth and economic freedom in some subcomponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Economic Freedom and Growth: Decomposing the Effects|first1 = Fredrik| last1 = Carlsson |first2 = Susanna |last2= Lundström|url=http://swopec.hhs.se/gunwpe/papers/gunwpe0033.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the free market view, a secure system of [[property rights (economics)|private property rights]] is an essential part of economic freedom.  Such systems include two main rights: the right to control and benefit from property and the right to transfer property by voluntary means. These rights offer people the possibility of autonomy and self-determination according to their personal values and goals.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Harper. ''Foundations of Entrepreneurship and Economic Development''. (1999). Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-15342-5}} p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Milton Friedman]] sees property rights as "the most basic of human rights and an essential foundation for other human rights."&lt;ref&gt;Rose D. Friedman, Milton Friedman. ''Two Lucky People: Memoirs''. (1998). University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-26414-9}} p. 605&lt;/ref&gt; With property rights protected, people are free to choose the use of their property, earn on it, and transfer it to anyone else, as long as they do it on a voluntary basis and do not resort to force, fraud or theft. In such conditions most people can achieve much greater personal freedom and development than under a regime of government coercion. A secure system of property rights also reduces uncertainty and encourages investments, creating favorable conditions for an economy to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard H. Siegan.

(1997). {{ISBN|1-56000-974-8}} pp. 9, 230&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empirical evidence]] suggests that countries with strong property rights systems have economic growth rates almost twice as high as those of countries with weak property rights systems, and that a market system with significant private property rights is an essential condition for democracy.&lt;ref&gt;David L.

====Freedom of contract====
[[Freedom of contract]] is the right to choose one's contracting parties and to trade with them on any terms and conditions one sees fit. Contracts permit individuals to create their own enforceable legal rules, adapted to their unique situations.&lt;ref&gt;John V. Orth. ''Contract and the Common Law''. Published in '' The State and Freedom of Contract''. (1998). Stanford University Press {{ISBN|0-8047-3370-8}} p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all contracts need to be enforced by the state. For example, in the United States there is a large number of third-party [[arbitration]] tribunals which resolve disputes under private commercial law.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Harper. ''Foundations of Entrepreneurship and Economic Development''. (1999). Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-15342-5}} pp. 82–88&lt;/ref&gt; Negatively understood, freedom of contract is freedom from government interference and from imposed value judgments of fairness. The notion of "freedom of contract" was given one of its most famous legal expressions in 1875 by Sir [[George Jessel (jurist)|George Jessel]] [[Master of the Rolls|MR]]:&lt;ref&gt;Hans van Ooseterhout, Jack J. Vromen, Pursey Heugensp. ''Social Institutions of Capitalism: Evolution and Design of Social Contracts''. (2003). Edward Elgar Publishing. {{ISBN|1-84376-495-4}} p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|[I]f there is one thing more than another public policy requires it is that men of full age and competent understanding shall have the utmost liberty of contracting, and that their contracts when entered into freely and voluntarily shall be held sacred and shall be enforced by courts of justice. Therefore, you have this paramount public policy to consider – that you are not lightly to interfere with this freedom of contract.}}

The doctrine of freedom of contract received one of its strongest expressions in the [[US Supreme Court]] case of [[Lochner v New York]] which struck down legal restrictions on the working hours of bakers. [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/capitalism/landmark_lochner.html]

Critics of the classical view of freedom of contract argue that this freedom is illusory when the bargaining power of the parties is highly unequal, most notably in the case of contracts between employers and workers. As in the case of restrictions on working hours, workers as a group may benefit from legal protections that prevent individuals agreeing to contracts that require long working hours. In its [[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish]] decision in 1937, overturning Lochner, the Supreme Court cited an earlier decisions {{cquote|The legislature has also recognized the fact, which the experience of legislators in many States has corroborated, that the proprietors of these establishments and their operatives do not stand upon an equality, and that [p. 394] their interests are, to a certain extent, conflicting. The former naturally desire to obtain as much labor as possible from their employees, while the latter are often induced by the fear of discharge to conform to regulations which their judgment, fairly exercised, would pronounce to be detrimental to their health or strength. In other words, the proprietors lay down the rules and the laborers are practically constrained to obey them. In such cases, self-interest is often an unsafe guide, and the legislature may properly interpose its authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0300_0379_ZO.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
From this point on, the Lochner view of freedom of contract has been rejected by US courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Supreme Court . Capitalism and Conflict . Landmark Cases . Lochner v. New York (1905) {{!}}PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/capitalism/landmark_lochner.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic and political freedom===
Some free market advocates argue that political and [[civil liberties]] have simultaneously expanded with market-based economies, and present empirical evidence to support the claim that economic and [[political freedom]]s are linked.&lt;ref&gt;''Freedom in the World.'' (1999). Transaction Publishers. {{ISBN|0-7658-0675-4}} p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis F. Abbott. ''British Democracy: Its Restoration &amp; Extension'', ISR/Google Books, 2006, 2010.  Chapter Five: “The Legal Protection Of Democracy &amp; Freedom: The Case For A New Written Constitution &amp; Bill Of Rights”. [https://books.google.com/books?id=xwN-MIMtE6sC&amp;dq=ISBN090632131X]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' (1962), Friedman further developed Friedrich Hayek's argument that economic freedom, while itself an extremely important component of total freedom, is also a necessary condition for political freedom. He commented that [[centrally planned economy|centralized control of economic activities]] was always accompanied with political repression. In his view, voluntary character of all transactions in a free market economy and wide diversity that it permits are fundamental threats to repressive political leaders and greatly diminish power to coerce. Through elimination of centralized control of economic activities, economic power is separated from political power, and the one can serve as counterbalance to the other. Friedman feels that competitive capitalism is especially important to minority groups, since impersonal market forces protect people from discrimination in their economic activities for reasons unrelated to their productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Milton Friedman. ''Capitalism and freedom''. (2002). The University of Chicago. {{ISBN|0-226-26421-1}} pp. 8–21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] argued that economic and political freedom were mutually dependent: "The idea that political freedom can be preserved in the absence of economic freedom, and vice versa, is an illusion. Political freedom is the corollary of economic freedom. It is no accident that the age of capitalism became also the age of government by the people."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Von Mises]]. Planning for Freedom. Libertarian Press. 1962. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', Hayek argued that "Economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends."&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Hayek]], ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', University Of Chicago Press; 50th Anniversary edition (1944), {{ISBN|0-226-32061-8}} p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek criticized [[socialist]] policies as the slippery slope that can lead to totalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Road to Serfdom: Text and Documents |last=Hayek |first= Friedrich |year=2007 |publisher= University of Chicago Press |isbn= 978-0-226-32055-7 |pages=53–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon Tullock]] has argued that "the Hayek-Friedman argument" predicted totalitarian governments in much of Western Europe in the late 20th century – which did not occur. He uses the example of Sweden, in which the government at that time controlled 63 percent of [[GNP]], as an example to support his argument that the basic problem with ''The Road to Serfdom'' is "that it offered predictions which turned out to be false. The steady advance of government in places such as Sweden has not led to any loss of non-economic freedoms." While criticizing Hayek, Tullock still praises the classical liberal notion of economic freedom, saying, "Arguments for political freedom are strong, as are the arguments for economic freedom. We needn’t make one set of arguments depend on the other."&lt;ref name=Tullock&gt;{{cite book |last = Tullock|first=Gordon|author-link = Gordon Tullock|editor-last=Walker|editor-first=Michael A.|title=Freedom, Democracy and Economic Welfare|pages=60–64|publisher=The Fraser Institute|place=Vancouver, B.C., Canada|year=1988|url=http://fraser.stg.devlin.ca/commerce.web/publication_details.aspx?pubID=2942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indices of economic freedom===
{{Main|Indices of economic freedom}}

The annual surveys ''[[Economic Freedom of the World]]'' (EFW) and ''[[Index of Economic Freedom]]'' (IEF) are two indices which attempt to measure the degree of economic freedom in the world's nations. The EFW index, originally developed by Gwartney, Lawson and Block at the [[Fraser Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;Gwartney, L., R. Lawson, and W. Block (1996). ''[[Economic Freedom of the World]]'', 1975–1995. Vancouver: Fraser Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; was likely the most used in empirical studies as of 2000.&lt;ref name=Heckelman&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heckelman | first1 = Jac C. | last2 = Stroup | first2 = Michael D. | year = 2000 | title = Which Economic Freedoms Contribute to Growth? | url = | journal = Kyklos | volume = 53 | issue = 4| pages = 527–44 | doi = 10.1111/1467-6435.00132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other major index, which was developed by [[The Heritage Foundation]] and [[The Wall Street Journal]] appears superior for data work, although as it only goes back to 1995, it is less useful for historical comparisons.&lt;ref name=Heckelman/&gt;

According to the creators of the indices, these rankings correlate strongly with higher average income per person, higher income of the poorest 10%, higher life expectancy, higher literacy, lower infant mortality, higher access to water sources and less corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freetheworld.com/2004/efw2004ch1.pdf Economic Freedom of the World: 2004 Annual Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316215702/http://www.freetheworld.com/2004/efw2004ch1.pdf |date=2016-03-16 }} (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/chapters/pdf/index2008_execsum.pdf Index of Economic Freedom – Executive Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227044144/http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/chapters/pdf/index2008_execsum.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }} (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; The people living in the top one-fifth of countries enjoy an average income of $23,450 and a growth rate in the 1990s of 2.56 percent per year; in contrast, the bottom one-fifth in the rankings had an average income of just $2,556 and a -0.85 percent growth rate in the 1990s. The poorest 10 percent of the population have an average income of just $728 in the lowest ranked countries compared with over $7,000 in the highest ranked countries. The life expectancy of people living in the highest ranked nations is 20 years longer than for people in the lowest ranked countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buckeyeinstitute.org/article/318|title=Issues|author=|date=|website=The Buckeye Institute|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher economic freedom, as measured by both the Heritage and the Fraser indices, correlates strongly with higher self-reported happiness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=8179 In Pursuit of Happiness Research. Is It Reliable? What Does It Imply for Policy?] The Cato institute. April 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Erik Gartzke of the Fraser Institute estimates that countries with a high EFW are significantly less likely to be involved in wars, while his measure of [[democracy]] had little or no impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pubs/efw/efw2005/efw2005-2.pdf Chapter2: Economic Freedom and Peace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016060114/http://www.cato.org/pubs/efw/efw2005/efw2005-2.pdf |date=2008-10-16 }}, Economic Freedom of the World 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Economic Freedom of the World'' score for the entire world has grown considerably in recent decades. The average score has increased from 5.17 in 1985 to 6.4 in 2005. Of the nations in 1985, 95 nations increased their score, seven saw a decline, and six were unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freetheworld.com/release_2005.html|title=Economic Freedom of the World: 2005 Annual Report|author=|date=|website=freetheworld.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the 2008 Index of Economic Freedom methodology world economic freedom has increased 2.6 points since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS49743+15-Jan-2008+PRN20080115|title=Economic Freedom Holding Steady |author=|date=|website=reuters.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[World Bank Group]] also use ''Index of Economic Freedom'' as the indicator of investment climate, because it covers more aspects relevant to the private sector in wide number of countries.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://psdblog.worldbank.org/psdblog/2006/08/our_effectivene.html Improving Investment Climates]'', World Bank Publications, 2006. {{ISBN|0-8213-6282-8}} pp. 221–24&lt;/ref&gt;

====Critiques====
The nature of economic freedom is often in dispute. [[Robert Lawson (economist)|Robert Lawson]], the co-author of ''EFW'', even acknowledges the potential shortcomings of freedom indices: "The purpose of the EFW index is to measure, no doubt imprecisely, the degree of economic freedom that exists."&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Robert A. 2006. "'On Testing the Connection between
Economic Freedom and Growth." ''Econ Journal Watch'' 3(3): 398–406. [http://econjwatch.org/issues/volume-3-number-1-september-2006]&lt;/ref&gt; He likens the recent attempts of economists to measure economic freedom to the initial attempts of economists to measure GDP: "They [macroeconomists] were
scientists who sat down to design, as best they could with the tools at hand, a measure of the current economic activity of the nation. Economic activity exists and their job was to measure it.  Likewise economic freedom exists. It is a thing. We can define and measure it."
Thus, it follows that some [[economists]], [[socialists]] and [[anarchists]] contend that the existing indicators of economic freedom are too narrowly defined and should take into account a broader conception of economic freedoms.

Critics of the indices (e.g. [[Thom Hartmann]]) also oppose the inclusion of business-related measures like corporate charters and [[intellectual property]] protection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thomhartmann.com/index.php option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=183&lt;/ref&gt; John Miller in [[Dollars &amp; Sense]] has stated that the indices are "a poor barometer of either freedom more broadly construed or of prosperity." He argues that the high correlation between living standards and economic freedom as measured by IEF is the result of choices made in the construction of the index that guarantee this result. For example, the treatment of a large informal sector (common in poor countries) as an indicator of restrictive government policy, and the use of the change in the ratio of government spending to national income, rather than the level of this ratio. Hartmann argues that these choices cause the [[social democratic]] European countries to rank higher than countries where the government share of the economy is small but growing.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dollarsandsense.org/archives/2005/0305miller.html |title=Free, Free at Last &amp;#124; Dollars &amp; Sense |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists [[Dani Rodrik]] and [[Jeffrey Sachs]] have separately noted that there appears to be little correlation between measured economic freedom and economic growth when the least free countries are disregarded, as indicated by the strong growth of the Chinese economy in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Sachs, ''The End of Poverty; How We Can Make It Happen In Our Lifetime'' (Penguin Books, 2005), pp. 320–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2007/10/is-there-a-grow.html |title=Dani Rodrik's weblog: Is there a growth payoff to economic freedom? |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris Altman found that there is a relatively large correlation between economic freedom and both per capita income and per capita growth. He argues that this is especially true when it comes to sub-indices relating to property rights and sound money, while he calls into question the importance of sub-indices relating to labor regulation and government size once certain threshold values are passed.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Altman, "How Much Economic Freedom is Necessary for Economic Growth? Theory and Evidence," ''Economics Bulletin'', Vol. 15 (2008), no. 2, pp. 1–20.&lt;/ref&gt; John Miller further observes that [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]], both only "partially free" according to [[Freedom House]], are leading countries on both economic freedom indices and casts doubt on the claim that measured economic freedom is associated with political freedom.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; However, according to the Freedom House, "there is a high and statistically significant correlation between the level of political freedom as measured by Freedom House and economic freedom as measured by the Wall Street Journal/Heritage Foundation survey."&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Karatnycky. ''Freedom in the World: The Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties''. Transaction Publishers. 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-7658-0101-2}}. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Choice sets and economic freedom==
{{Expand section|date=September 2010}}

[[Amartya Sen]] and other economists consider economic freedom to be measured in terms of the set of economic choices available to individuals. Economic freedom is greater when individuals have more economic choices available – when, in some technical sense, the [[choice set]] of individuals expands.

===Positive and negative freedom===
The differences between alternative views of economic freedom have been expressed in terms of [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s distinction between [[positive freedom]] and [[negative freedom]]. Classical liberals favour a focus on negative freedom as did Berlin himself. By contrast [[Amartya Sen]] argues for an understanding of freedom in terms of capabilities to pursue a range of goals.&lt;ref name=Sen1993MAF&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sen|first=Amartya K.|authorlink=Amartya Sen|year=1993|journal=[[Oxford Economic Papers]]|title=Markets and Freedoms: Achievements and Limitations of the Market Mechanism in Promoting Individual Freedoms|volume=45|issue=4|pages=519–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; One measure which attempts to assess freedom in the positive sense is Goodin, Rice, Parpo, and Eriksson's measure of discretionary time, which is an estimate of how much time people have at their disposal during which they are free to choose the activities in which they participate, after taking into account the time they need to spend acquiring the necessities of life.&lt;ref name="Goodin"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Goodin | first1 = Robert E. | last2 = Rice | first2 = James Mahmud | last3 = Parpo | first3 = Antti | last4 = Eriksson | first4 = Lina | title = Discretionary Time: A New Measure of Freedom | place = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-521-70951-4 |pages=1–54 |url=http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521709514}} Chapter 1 and 2 discusses the context and validity of the new measure.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''Capitalism and Freedom'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedman|first1=Milton|title=Capitalism and Freedom|date=1962|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milton Friedman explains the preservation of freedom is the reason for limited and decentralized governments. It creates positive freedom within the society allowing for freedom of choice for an individual in a free society.

==Freedom from want==
[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] included [[freedom from want]] in his [[Four freedoms]] speech. Roosevelt stated that freedom from want "translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants-everywhere in the world".{{cn|date=February 2017}} In terms of US policy, Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] included economic freedoms such as freedom of [[trade union]] organisation, as well as a wide range of policies of government intervention and redistributive taxation aimed at promoting freedom from want.{{cn|date=February 2017}} Internationally, Roosevelt favored the policies associated with the [[Bretton Woods Agreement]] which fixed exchange rates and established international economic institutions such as the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]].{{cn|date=February 2017}}

[[Herbert Hoover]] saw economic freedom as a fifth freedom, which secures survival of Roosevelt's Four freedoms. He described economic freedom as freedom "for men to choose their own calling, to accumulate property in protection of their children and old age, [and] freedom of enterprise that does not injure others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=President Herbert Hoover |last=Whisenhunt |first=Donald W. |year=2007 |publisher=Nova Publishers |isbn=978-1-60021-476-9 |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of association and unions==
The Philadelphia Declaration (enshrined in the constitution of the [[International Labour Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/english/iloconst.htm#annex |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091222152631/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/english/iloconst.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-12-22 |title=Constitution of the International Labour Organization |work= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) states that "all human beings, irrespective of race, creed or sex, have the right to pursue both their material well-being and their spiritual development in conditions of freedom and dignity, of economic security and equal opportunity." The ILO further states that "The right of workers and employers to form and join organizations of their own choosing is an integral part of a free and open society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/global/Themes/Freedom_of_Association_and_the_Right_to_Collective_Bargaining/lang--en/index.htm |title=Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining – Themes |work= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204135134/http://www.ilo.org./global/Themes/Freedom_of_Association_and_the_Right_to_Collective_Bargaining/lang--en/index.htm |archivedate=2008-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socialist views==
The [[socialist]] view of economic freedom conceives of freedom as a concrete situation as opposed to an abstract or moral concept. This view of freedom is closely related to the socialist view of human creativity and the importance ascribed to creative freedom. Socialists view creativity as an essential aspect of human nature, thus defining freedom as a situation or state of being where individuals are able to express their creativity unhindered by constraints of both material scarcity and coercive social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Bhargava. ''Political Theory: An Introduction''. Pearson Education India, 2008. p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxist]]s stress the importance of freeing the individual from what they view as coercive, [[Exploitation (Marxism)|exploitative]] and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienating]] social relationships of production they are compelled to partake in, as well as the importance of economic development as providing the material basis for the existence of a state of society where there are enough resources to allow for each individual to pursue his or her genuine creative interests.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Goodwin. Using Political Ideas. West Sussex, England, UK: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd., 2007. p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socioeconomic impact of economic freedom==
One of the ways to measure economic competitiveness is by comparing an extent of economic freedom that countries have, which as surveys show can also largely explain differences in economic well-being across the world.  Generally, countries with higher economic freedom have higher gross domestic product per capita and its growth rates, as well as better health care, education quality, environment protection, income equality, and happiness results. These trends of increasing prosperity are confirmed even when we compare these indicators within territories of countries. 
Nevertheless, despite these benefits societies have to be aware that with increasing economic freedom they will have to face going through a phase of increasing [[economic inequality|inequality]], which basically is a result of decreased redistribution, as well as other negative effects from [[economic liberalization]], i.e., running of local enterprises out of business, takeover of competitive firms, enforcing of interests of foreign companies, dependence on foreign capital, deteriorating work rights, harmful manufacturing for the environment, introducing of commercial practices that are not favorable for consumers, as well as endangerment for survival of national cultures.
However, on the bright side, these negative effects from economic freedom tend to be felt in a shorter term, and if countries use the opportunities of economic freedom in our increasingly globalized economy in a right way, as research shows their socioeconomic conditions will be significantly better than in a case of less economic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Rožāns, Edgars, The Socioeconomic Impact of Economic Freedom. Humanities and Social Sciences, pp. 105–25, 2015. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2683493&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced|date=August 2017}}
An '''entity''' is something that [[Existence|exists]] as itself, as a subject or as an object, actually or potentially, concretely or abstractly, physically or not.  It need not be of material existence. In particular, [[abstraction]]s and [[legal fiction]]s are usually regarded as entities. In general, there is also no presumption that an entity is [[Life|animate]], or [[present]].

The word is abstract in intention. It may refer, for example, to [[Bucephalus]], the horse of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]; to a stone; to a [[cardinal number]]; to a language; or to [[ghost]]s or other [[spirit]]s.

The word ''entitative'' is the adjective form of the noun entity. Something that is entitative is considered in its own right.

== In philosophy ==
{{Main article|Ontology}}
Ontology is the study of being, existence and the recognition of entities. The words ontic and entity are derived respectively from the ancient Greek and Latin present participles that mean "[[being]]".

== In law ==
{{Main article|Legal person}}
In [[law]], a legal entity is an entity that is capable of bearing legal [[rights]] and [[obligation]]s, such as a [[natural person]] or an [[Legal person|artificial person]] (e.g. business entity or a corporate entity).

== In politics ==
{{Main article|Polity}}
In [[politics]], ''entity'' is used as term for territorial divisions of some countries (e.g. [[Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]]).

== In medicine ==
{{Main article|Medicine}}
In [[medicine]], a disease entity is an illness due to a particular definite cause or to a specific pathological process. While a disease entity is not defined by a [[syndrome]], it may or may not be manifest in one or more particular syndromes.

'''Environmental inequality in the United Kingdom''' is the way in which the quality of the environment differs between different communities in the UK.&lt;ref name="defra1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/reports/cat09/0701110944_AQinequalitiesFNL_AEAT_0506.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415121248/http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/reports/cat09/0701110944_AQinequalitiesFNL_AEAT_0506.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences are felt across a number of aspects of the environment, including air pollution, access to green space and exposure to flood risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lsx.org.uk/resources/EJIDefinition_page3198.aspx |title=London Sustainability Exchange |publisher=LSX |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425162529/http://www.lsx.org.uk/resources/EJIDefinition_page3198.aspx# |archive-date=2012-04-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The concept of 'environmental inequality'==
===Definitions===
[[The Environment Agency]], a British non-departmental public body of the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (DEFRA), defines 'environmental inequality' as follows: 'To observe or claim an environmental inequality is to point out that an aspect of the environment is distributed unevenly amongst different social groups (differentiated by social class, ethnicity, gender, age, location, etc.)'.&lt;ref name="staffs1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staffs.ac.uk/schools/sciences/geography/links/IESR/downloads/SC020061_SR1%20report%20-%20inequalities%20%20flood%20risk.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - PUBLISHED FLOOD.doc |website=Staffs.ac.uk |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sustainable Development Research Network (SDRN) define environmental inequality as follows: 'Environmental inequality refers to the unequal distribution of environmental risks and hazards and access to environmental goods and services.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sd-research.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/sdrnbriefingtwo_final_000.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425162529/http://www.sd-research.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/sdrnbriefingtwo_final_000.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon Walker (professor)|Gordon Walker]] (Department of Geography, Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University and Malcolm Eames (University of Cardiff) define 'environmental inequality' as 'covering a wide range of questions of difference or unevenness, including:

*Who has good quality and safe environment to live in, who experiences pollution, hazards and risks and who is distanced or protected from such impacts?
*Who accesses and consumes environmental resources and who is unable to do so, or limited in their degree of access and consumption?
*Who is able to shape environmental decision-making and who is not? Who is included who is excluded?'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.lancs.ac.uk/envjustice/eiseminars/downloads/ei_discussion.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313100328/http://geography.lancs.ac.uk/envjustice/eiseminars/downloads/ei_discussion.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist Liam Downey (2005) has distinguished five different ways of defining environmental inequality:

i) Intentional racism definitions: According to this definition, environmental inequalities arise when environmental hazards are intentionally placed in minority neighbourhoods by private companies.

ii) Disparate exposure definitions: According to this definition, environmental inequalities arise 'when members of a specific social group are more highly exposed to some set of environmental pollutants than we would expect if group members were randomly distributed across residential space'.

iii) Disparate health impact definitions: According to this definition, environmental inequalities arise 'when the negative health effects of residential proximity or exposure to environmental hazards are distributed unequally across social groups.'

iv) Disparate social impacts definitions: According to this definition, environmental inequalities arise 'when members of a specific social group are more likely to live in environmentally hazardous neighborhoods than we would expect if group members were randomly distributed across residential space.'

v) Relative distribution of burdens versus benefits definitions: According to this definition, environmental inequalities arise when groups that receive greater benefits from capitalist social relations (according to proponents of this definition, this means whites and the middle and upper classes) are less burdened by industrial pollution than groups that receive fewer benefits from capitalist social relations (according to proponents of this definition, this means people of colour, the poor and the working classes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3162366 | pmid=21874079 | doi=10.1080/027321790518870 | volume=25 | title=Assessing Environmental Inequality: How the conclusions we draw vary according to the definitions we employ | year=2005 | journal=Sociol Spectr | pages=349–369 | last1 = Downey | first1 = L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History ===
The concept of environmental inequality emerged in the context of the movement for [[Environmental Justice]]. The Environmental Justice movement originated in the US in the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ejrc.cau.edu/ejinthe21century.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125172813/http://www.ejrc.cau.edu/ejinthe21century.htm |archivedate=2011-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to concerns about communities from poor, black and minority ethnic environments being disproportionately affected by environmental issues and excluded from environmental decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;See Schlosberg, David. (2007) Defining Environmental Justice: Theories, Movements, and Nature. [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Much initial progress on promoting an Environmental Justice agenda in the UK was made in Scotland, beginning with a speech made by [[Jack McConnell]], First Minister of the [[Scottish Executive]] in 2002. McConnell said: '... the reality is that the people who have the most urgent environmental concerns in Scotland are those who daily cope with the consequences of a poor quality of life, and live in a rotten environment – close to industrial pollution, plagued by vehicle emissions, streets filled by litter and walls covered in graffiti. This is true for Scotland and also true elsewhere in the world. These are circumstances which would not be acceptable to better off communities in our society, and those who have to endure such environments in which to bring up a family, or grow old themselves are being denied environmental justice.'&lt;ref name="scotland2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/05/23091323/12 |title=Sustainable Development: A Review of International Literature |website=Scotland.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this speech, and in light of Environmental Justice campaigning by [[Friends of the Earth]] Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foe-scotland.org.uk/access-to-justice |title=Access to Environmental Justice &amp;#124; Friends of the Earth Scotland |website=Foe-scotland.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  references to Environmental Justice have been made in several Scottish policy documents ( e.g. Scottish Executive 2002c, 2003, 2003a (the Partnership Agreement); Scottish Executive Development Department, 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2005). The Scottish Executive, in 2005, commissioned research into ways of making environmental information more accessible to the public, and has also recently commissioned a study that investigates the social impacts of flooding.&lt;ref name="scotland2006"/&gt;

An Environmental Justice agenda has also been emerging in England since the late 1990s. In 1999, Environment Minister [[Michael Meacher]] wrote, in a foreword to 'Equality and the Environment' by Brenda Boardman: 'environmental problems are serious and impact most heavily on the most vulnerable members of society: the old, the very young and the poor.'&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/reports/environmental_justice.pdf |format=PDF |title=Environmental justice : Rights and means to a healthy environment for all |website=Foe.co.uk |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2001 speech, Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] spoke about the need to address environmental issues such as access to green space and air quality in deprived urban areas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://number10.gov.uk/page158 |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20061004085342/number10.gov.uk/page158 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-10-04 |title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT&amp;#93; UK Government Web Archive – The National Archives |website=Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a speech given to the UN in New York, 2007, Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] said that 'the consequences of climate change will be disproportionately felt by the poorest who are least responsible for it – making the issue of climate change one of justice as much as economic development...economic progress social justice and environmental care now go together.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6924570.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; UK Politics &amp;#124; In full: Brown's speech at UN |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-07-31 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of this agenda became clear at a policy level in England, in [[DEFRA]]'s 1999 Sustainable Development Strategy 'A Better Life', in which there was a focus on access to environmental information, decision making and justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sustainable-development.gov.uk/publications/uk-strategy99/index.htm |title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT&amp;#93; UK Government Web Archive – The National Archives |website=Collections.europarchive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080530153425/http:/www.sustainable-development.gov.uk/publications/uk-strategy99/index.htm |archivedate=2008-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Environmental Justice theme was evident again in the 2004 Sustainable Development Strategy, which commissioned a public consultation on issues around environmental justice and equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sustainable-development.gov.uk/publications/pdf/finalsummary.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Draft final.doc |website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080530153425/http://www.sustainable-development.gov.uk/publications/pdf/finalsummary.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, in 2003, the government's Social Exclusion Unit published a report that examined issues around inequalities in transport and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/social_exclusion_task_force/assets/publications_1997_to_2006/making_transport_2003.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100907154242/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/social_exclusion_task_force/assets/publications_1997_to_2006/making_transport_2003.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-09-07 |format=PDF |title=Making the Connections: Final Report on Transport and Social Exclusion |website=Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |accessdate=2016-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One governmental actor involved in pushing forward the Environmental Justice agenda was The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. In 2004, it included environmental factors in its indices of deprivation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/communities/pdf/131209.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081211181656/http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/communities/pdf/131209.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 2005, it commissioned research into the links between social and economic conditions and environmental quality.&lt;ref&gt;'Improving the prospects of people living in areas of multiple deprivation in England' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The UK Environmental Justice agenda was also taken on by the government's [[Sustainable Development Commission]] (SDC). In their November 2001 review of the UK's Sustainable Development Strategy, SDC approached issues of regeneration, poverty and the environment with an environmental justice perspective,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/data/files/publications/011101%20Review%202001%20-%20headlining%20sustainable%20development.pdf |format=PDF |title=Review 2001: headlining sustainable development |website=Sd-commission.org.uk |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in their 2002 report 'Vision for Sustainable Regeneration, Environment and Poverty', SDC stressed the need for a new approach to sustainable regeneration that acknowledges the importance of environmental inequalities and the links between poverty and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/data/files/publications/021001%20Vision%20for%20sustainable%20regeneration,%20environment.pdf |format=PDF |title=Vision for sustainable regeneration, environment &amp; poverty – the missing link |website=Sd-commission.org.uk |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discourse around environmental justice in the UK is often framed in terms of 'environmental equality', following DEFRA's decision to use environmental equality as one of its sustainable development indicators.&lt;ref name="defra2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sd.defra.gov.uk/2011/09/defra-invites-feedback-on-proposals-for-new-indicators/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20111108152326/http://sd.defra.gov.uk/2011/09/defra-invites-feedback-on-proposals-for-new-indicators/ |archivedate=2011-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sd.defra.gov.uk/progress/national/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20111108125944/http://sd.defra.gov.uk/progress/national/ |archivedate=2011-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==People affected==
The Environment Agency states that 'People who are socially and economically disadvantaged often live in the worst environments. For example, those living in the most deprived parts of England experience the worst air quality and have less access to green space and adequate housing. These problems can affect people's health and well being and can add to the burden of social and economic deprivation. They can also limit the opportunities available for people to improve their lives and undermine attempts to renew local neighbourhoods. Those affected tend to be the most vulnerable and excluded in society.'&lt;ref name="Archived copy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/research/library/position/41189.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529041353/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/research/library/position/41189.aspx |archivedate=2012-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence that people from [[Black and ethnic minority|BME]] (black and minority ethnic) backgrounds suffer the worst environmental conditions, and are excluded from environmental decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Agyeman, J., 'Ethnic minorities in Britain: short change, systematic indifference and sustainable development', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; UK NGO and think-tank Capacity Global, in 'BMEs – Tackling Social and Environmental Justice', argue that several barriers exist, which hinder BAME communities' action on tackling environmental problems.&lt;ref name="capacity1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capacity.org.uk/downloads/BAMEs_tackling_social_environmental_justice.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402025518/http://www.capacity.org.uk/downloads/BAMEs_tackling_social_environmental_justice.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Access to parks, green spaces and the natural environment===
The most affluent 20 per cent of council wards have five times the amount of parks or general green space (excluding gardens) per person than the most deprived 10 per cent of wards.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cabe.org.uk/files/urban-green-nation.pdf |title=Online Casino - Play Blackjack, Roulette, Slots &amp; More &amp;#124; Casino Oasis |website=Cabe.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wards with a population with fewer than 2% black and minority ethnic residents have six times as many parks and eleven times more public green space as wards where more than 40 per cent of the population are people from black and minority ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

According to a 2011 DEFRA White Paper on the Natural Environment, people in deprived areas are nearly six times less likely than those in affluent ones to describe their area as 'green', and 'those living in deprived areas, minority ethnic communities, elderly people and those with disabilities have less access to green spaces or tend to use them less.' This paper also noted that the frequency of exposure to the natural environment (incorporating a broad array of living things including wildlife, forests, rivers, streams, lakes, seas, countryside, farmed land and urban green space) is 'significantly lower' amongst those aged above 65, BME populations and those on low incomes (members of DE socioeconomic groups).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm80/8082/8082.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725050649/http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm80/8082/8082.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the government's [[Forestry Commission]], several factors interact to prevent black and minority ethnic groups from having the same access to woodland as other groups. These are: economic factors; lack of awareness, familiarity, knowledge, confidence or interest; cultural attitudes and preferences; feeling unwelcome and out of place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/FR290807_RESFinalReport.pdf/$FILE/FR290807_RESFinalReport.pdf |title=Race Equality and the Forestry Commission - Final Report |website=Forestry.gov.uk |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exposure to flood risk===
Deprived communities are more exposed to flood risk, with eight times more people in the most deprived 10% of the population living in tidal floodplains than the least deprived 10%. People in deciles 1 and 2 (decile 1 being the most deprived 10% of the population and decile 2 the second most deprived 10%) are 47 per cent more likely to be living at risk of flooding than the rest of the population for zone 2 floodrisk areas, and 62% more likely for zone 3.&lt;ref name="staffs1"/&gt;

===Air pollution===
The worst levels of [[air pollution]] are experienced by people in the most deprived 10% areas in England. These people are also subject to 41% higher concentrations of nitrogen dioxide from transport and industry than the average.&lt;ref name="defra1"/&gt; The average black or black-British African in the UK person is exposed to 27.25 micrograms per cubic metre of harmful pollutant PM10. This is over 28% higher than the average urban white person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endsreport.com/docs/20090820a.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710192634/http://www.endsreport.com/docs/20090820a.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exposure to harmful chemicals===
A 1999 Friends of the Earth report found that 82% of all carcinogenic chemical emissions were released by factories in the most deprived 20% wards. Further, the report suggested that because 70% of all people from ethnic minorities in the UK live in the 88 most deprived wards, this exposure to harmful chemicals disproportionately affects these people.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Transport-related problems===
Over a quarter  of child pedestrian casualties happen in the most deprived 10% of wards. In Wales, children and people aged over 65 are twice as likely to be injured by motor vehicles in deprived areas than in more advantaged areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustrans.org.uk/assets/files/AT/Publications/health_inequality_FINAL.pdf) ]{{dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proximity to waste and landfill sites===
An investigation by the Environment Agency into Environmental Justice in South Yorkshire revealed that in South Yorkshire, people in decile 1 are twice as likely to be living next to a recycling site, a waste transfer site or a landfill site as the rest of the population and three times more likely to be living near to an amenity site.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Justice in South Yorkshire: Locating Social Deprivation and Poor Environments using Multiple Indicators Fairburn J, Butler B and Smith G, Local Environment Vol. 14 (2) 2009 pp 139 – 154 Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK as a whole, deprived communities are more likely to live near waste sites except landfill sites, where it is the least deprived populations that are located nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.lancs.ac.uk/EnvJustice/downloads/SR3%20Waste.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512064536/http://geography.lancs.ac.uk/EnvJustice/downloads/SR3%20Waste.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Innospec]], a company based in [[Ellesmere Port]], is the last remaining manufacturer of [[tetraethyl lead]] in the world.

==Causes==
As for the causes of environmental inequalities in the UK, the Environment Agency writes: 'The causes of these inequalities are often complex and long-standing. Some problems are due to the historical location of industry and communities; others are the result of the impacts of new developments such as traffic. Often these environmental problems are caused by the actions of others who do not live in the affected community. Often those most affected have not been involved in the decisions that affect the quality of their environment.'&lt;ref name="Archived copy"/&gt; Environmental equity advocates often argue that environmental inequalities are entrenched due to the fact that the vulnerable communities exposed to environmental burdens lack the means necessary to change their situation due to factors such as limited economic means, exclusion from decision-making processes and [[institutionalised racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbecal.org/pdf/healthy-communities.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007040211/http://www.cbecal.org/pdf/healthy-communities.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work being done==
The UK government has included environmental equality as one of its [[sustainable development]] indicators since the establishment of these indicators in 1992.&lt;ref name="defra2"/&gt;  Further, [[DEFRA]] have incorporated an environmental inequalities analysis into its work,&lt;ref name="defra1"/&gt; and the Environment Agency have published several reports on environmental inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/PDF/SCHO0507BMRW-E-E.pdf |title=Publications - GOV.UK |website=Publications.environment-agency.gov.uk |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/PDF/SCHO0905BJOK-E-E.pdf |title=Publications - GOV.UK |website=Publications.environment-agency.gov.uk |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/PDF/SCHO0507BMRU-E-E.pdf |title=Publications - GOV.UK |website=Publications.environment-agency.gov.uk |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/PDF/SCHO0507BMRV-E-E.pdf |title=Publications - GOV.UK |website=Publications.environment-agency.gov.uk |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Wales, action around environmental inequalities has primarily been coordinated through the [[Welsh Assembly]]'s Community First initiative, which has attempted to enable deprived communities to take action themselves on sustainable development issues, with a particular focus on health inequalities and the health benefits of access to environmental goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wcva.org.uk/all/dsp_text.cfm?0%3D0%26display_sitetextid%3D1504 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208213351/http://www.wcva.org.uk/all/dsp_text.cfm?0=0&amp;display_sitetextid=1504 |archivedate=2011-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Welsh Assembly have recognised the environmental aspects of deprivation, incorporating this into its 2008 index of multiple deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wales.gov.uk/docs/statistics/2010/100712wimd08summaryen.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.proni.gov.uk/20110830024651/http://wales.gov.uk/docs/statistics/2010/100712wimd08summaryen.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several UK academics have published widely around environmental inequalities. Academics working on environmental inequalities include Gordon Walker of Lancaster University and Professor Malcolm Eames of Cardiff University.&lt;ref&gt;See a paper co-written by Walker and Eames called 'Environmental inequalities : reflections on a transdisciplinary seminar series.' Local Environment, 13 (8). pp. 663-667&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Brunel University and Lancaster University organised a series of seminars on environmental inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.lancs.ac.uk/envjustice/eiseminars/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002232803/http://geography.lancs.ac.uk/envjustice/eiseminars/ |archivedate=2011-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was supported by the Economic &amp; Social Research Council, the Natural Environment Research Council, the Sustainable Development Research Council, the Environment Agency and DEFRA.

The following UK NGOs work on issues around environmental inequalities:
* [[Friends of the Earth]] do some work on issues around environmental justice and inequalities.

{{Evolutionary biology}}

[[Evolution (term)|Evolutionary]] ideas during the periods of the [[Renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment | the Enlightenment]] developed over a time when [[natural history]] became more sophisticated during the 17th and 18th centuries, and as the [[scientific revolution]] and the rise of  [[mechanical philosophy]] encouraged viewing the natural world as a machine with workings capable of analysis. But the evolutionary ideas of the early 18th century were of a religious and spiritural nature. In the second half of the 18th century more materialistic and explicit ideas about biological [[evolution]] began to emerge, adding further strands in the [[history of evolutionary thought]].

==17th and early 18th century==
The word ''evolution'' (from the [[Latin]] ''evolutio'', meaning "to unroll like a scroll") appeared in English in the 17th century, referring to an orderly sequence of events, particularly one in which the outcome was somehow contained within it from the start. Notably, in 1677 Sir [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]], attacking the [[atheist]]ic [[atomism]] of [[Democritus]] and [[Epicurus]], used the term ''evolution'' to describe his opponent's ideas that vibrations and collisions of atoms in the void &amp;mdash; without divine intervention &amp;mdash; had formed "Primordial Seeds" (semina) which were the "immediate, primitive, productive Principles of Men, Animals, Birds and Fishes."&lt;ref name="Goodrum2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodrum|first=Matthew R.|title=Atomism, Atheism, and the Spontaneous Generation of Human Beings: The Debate over a Natural Origin of the First Humans in Seventeenth-Century Britain|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=63| issue =  2|pages=207–224|date=April 2002|doi=10.1353/jhi.2002.0011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Hale, this mechanism was "absurd", because "it must have potentially at least the whole Systeme of Humane Nature, or at least that Ideal Principle or Configuration thereof, in the '''evolution''' whereof the complement and formation of the Humane Nature must consist ... and all this drawn from a fortuitous coalition of senseless and dead Atoms."&lt;ref name="Goodrum2002" /&gt;

While Hale (ironically) first used the term evolution in arguing ''against'' the exact mechanistic view the word would come to symbolize, he also demonstrates that at least some [[evolutionism|evolutionist]] theories explored between 1650 and 1800 postulated that the universe, including life on earth, had developed mechanically, entirely without divine guidance. Around this time, the [[mechanical philosophy]] of [[Descartes]], reinforced by the [[physics]] of [[Galileo]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], began to encourage the machine-like view of the universe which would come to characterise the [[scientific revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowler 2003 pp. 33-38&lt;/ref&gt; However, most contemporary theories of evolution, including those developed by the German idealist philosophers [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Hegel]] (and mocked by [[Schopenhauer]]), held that evolution was a fundamentally ''spiritual'' process, with the entire course of natural and human evolution being "a self-disclosing revelation of the Absolute".&lt;ref&gt;Schelling, ''System of Transcendental Idealism'', 1800&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical of these theorists, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] postulated in 1714 that "[[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]s" inside objects caused motion by internal forces, and maintained that "the 'germs' of all things have always existed ... [and] contain within themselves an internal principle of development which drives them on through a vast series of metamorphoses" to become the geological formations, lifeforms, psychologies, and civilizations of the present. Leibniz clearly felt that evolution proceeded on divine principles &amp;mdash; in his ''De rerum originatione radicali'' (1697), he wrote: "A cumulative increase of the beauty and universal perfection of the works of God, a perpetual and unrestricted progress of the universe as a whole must be recognized, such that it advances to a higher state of cultivation."&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy 1936, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[J. G. von Herder]], expressed similar ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy 1936, pp. 183–184, 279–280, 369&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1603 and 1613 [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] was a prisoner in the [[Tower of London]] awaiting execution; in this period he wrote a history of the world in five volumes where he described his American experiences and adventures, in it he wondered whether all the new species discovered in the new continent could have found their place on [[Noah's Ark]]. A very serious question at the time, he postulates that only animals from the old continent found place on the Ark; eventually, after the Flood, some of these animals would migrate to the new continent and, under environmental pressure, change their appearances to create new species.&lt;ref&gt;Wendt Herbert, ''In Search of Adam'', 1955, pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty years later, Matthew Hale went even further, and said that only the prototypes of all animal species were welcomed on the Ark; these would eventually differentiate after their release.&lt;ref&gt;Wendt Herbert, ''In Search of Adam'', 1955, pp. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Many clergymen were happy with Raleigh and Hale ideas since they appeared to solve the problem of the Ark's tonnage.

==Mid 18th century==
In his ''Venus Physique'' in 1745, and ''System of Nature'' in 1751, [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] veered toward more materialist ground. He wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over the course of many generations, producing races and even new species. He also anticipated in general terms the idea of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowler 2003 pp. 73–75&lt;/ref&gt;

Vague and general ideas of evolution continued to proliferate among the mid-eighteenth century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers. [[G. L. L. Buffon]] suggested that what most people referred to as species were really just well-marked varieties. He thought that the members of what was then called a genus (which in terms of modern [[scientific classification]] would be considered a family) are all descended from a single, common ancestor. The ancestor of each family had arisen through [[spontaneous generation]]; environmental effects then caused them to diverge into different species. He speculated that the 200 or so species of mammals then known might have descended from as few as 38 original forms. Buffon's concept of evolution was strictly limited. He believed there were "internal molds" that shaped the spontaneous generation of each family and that the families themselves were entirely and eternally distinct. Thus, lions, tigers, leopards, pumas and house cats could all share a common ancestor, but dogs and house cats could not.&lt;ref&gt;Bowler 2003 pp. 75–80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larson 2004 pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Darwin's foreword to his 6th edition of ''Origin'' credited [[Aristotle]] with foreshadowing the concept of [[natural selection]], he also wrote that "the first author who in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon".&lt;ref&gt;Darwin 1872 p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 18th-century writers speculated about human evolution. [[John Mitchell (geographer)|John Mitchell]], a [[physician]] and [[cartographer]], wrote a book in 1744 called ''An Essay upon the Causes of the Different Colours of People in Different Climates'' in which he claimed that the first [[race (classification of humans)|race]] on earth had been a brown and reddish colour he said "that an intermediate tawny colour found amongst Asiatics and Native Amerindians" had been the “original complexion of mankind” and that others races came about by the original race spending generations in different climates.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Kidd, The forging of races: race and scripture in the Protestant Atlantic world, 1600 - 2000, 2006, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1767 and 1792 [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo]] included in his writings not only the concept that man had descended from other primates, but also that, in response to their environment, creatures had found methods of transforming their characteristics over long time intervals. He also produced research on the evolution of [[linguistics]], which was cited by Erasmus Darwin in his poem ''Temple of Nature''.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Erasmus 1825 p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Jan-Andrew Henderson states that Monboddo was the first to articulate the theory of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1792, the philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] presented, in his ''[[Critique of Judgement]]'', what he referred to as “a daring venture of reason”, in which “one organic being [is] derived from another organic being, although from one which is specifically different; e.g., certain water-animals transform themselves gradually into marsh-animals and from these, after some generations, into land-animals.”&lt;ref&gt;Kant 1792 Section 80&lt;/ref&gt; Some 20th-century philosophers, such as [[Eric Voegelin]], credit Kant with foreshadowing modern evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Voegelin, CW VOL 3,Chapter 14, The Unfolding of the World of Organic Forms pp 142-144.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1796, [[Erasmus Darwin]] published his ''[[Zoönomia]]'', which suggested "that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament ... with the power of acquiring new parts"&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Erasmus 1818 Vol I section XXXIX&lt;/ref&gt; in response to stimuli, with each round of improvements being inherited by successive generations. In his 1802 poem ''Temple of Nature'', he described the rise of life from minute organisms living in the mud to its modern diversity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
First forms minute, unseen by spheric glass,&lt;br&gt;
Move on the mud, or pierce the watery mass;&lt;br&gt;
These, as successive generations bloom,&lt;br&gt;
New powers acquire and larger limbs assume;&lt;br&gt;
Whence countless groups of vegetation spring,&lt;br&gt;
And breathing realms of fin and feet and wing.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Erasmus 1825 p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An '''explanandum''' (a [[Latin]] term) is a sentence describing a [[phenomenon]] that is to be [[explanation|explained]], and the '''explanans''' are the sentences adduced as explanations of that phenomenon. For example, one person may pose an ''explanandum'' by asking "Why is there smoke?", and another may provide an ''explanans'' by responding "Because there is a fire". In this example, "smoke" is the ''explanandum'', and "fire" is the ''explanans''.

==In scientific method==
[[Carl Gustav Hempel]] and [[Paul Oppenheim]] (1948),&lt;ref name="HempelOppenheim1948"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Hempel CG, Oppenheim P |year=1948 |title=Studies in the Logic of Explanation |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=XV |pages=135–175 |doi=10.1086/286983|citeseerx=10.1.1.294.3693 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in their [[deductive-nomological model]] of scientific explanation, motivated the distinction between explanans and explanandum in order to answer why-questions, rather than simply what-questions:

{{Quotation|"the event under discussion is explained by subsuming it under general laws, i.e., by showing that it occurred in accordance with those laws, by virtue of the realization of certain specified antecedent conditions"|Hempel &amp; Oppenheim, 1948|(p.152)&lt;ref name="HempelOppenheim1948"/&gt;}}

Specifically, they define the concepts as follows:

{{Quotation|"By the ''explanandum'', we understand the sentence describing the phenomenon to be explained (not that phenomenon itself); by the ''explanans'', the class of those sentences which are adduced to account for the phenomenon"|Hempel &amp; Oppenheim, 1948|(p.152)&lt;ref name="HempelOppenheim1948"/&gt;}}

The crucial comment, with respect to the scientific method, is given as follows:

{{Quotation|"It may be said... that an explanation is not fully adequate unless its explanans, if taken account of in time, could have served as a basis for predicting the phenomenon under consideration....  It is this potential predictive force which gives scientific explanation its importance: Only to the extent that we are able to explain empirical facts can we attain the major objective of scientific research, namely not merely to record the phenomena of our experience, but to learn from them, by basing upon them theoretical generalizations which enable us to anticipate new occurrences and to control, at least to some extent, the changes in our environment"|Hempel &amp; Oppenheim, 1948|(p.154)&lt;ref name="HempelOppenheim1948"/&gt;}}

'''Fair trade''' is a foundation whose stated goal is to help producers in [[developing country|developing countries]] achieve better trading conditions. Members of the movement advocate the payment of higher prices to exporters, as well as improved social and [[environmental law|environmental standards]]. The movement focuses in particular on commodities, or products which are typically exported from developing countries to [[developed country|developed countries]], but also consumed in domestic markets (e.g. Brazil, India and Bangladesh) most notably [[handicrafts]], [[Economics of coffee|coffee]], [[Cocoa bean#Production|cocoa]], wine, sugar, fresh fruit, [[chocolate]], flowers and gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Brough | first = David | url = http://ca.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idCAL213911220080110 | title = Briton finds ethical jewellery good as gold | newspaper = Reuters | place = [[North America|NA]] | date = January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Moseley | first = WG | year = 2008 | title = Fair Trade Wine: North Africa's Post Apartheid Vineyards and the YouTube Global Economy| journal = Globalizations | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 291–304 | doi=10.1080/14747730802057753}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement seeks to promote greater equity in international trading partnerships through dialogue, [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]], and respect. It promotes [[sustainable development]] by offering better trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalized producers and workers in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title =WFTO | url = http://www.wfto.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1082&amp;Itemid=334&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fair trade is grounded in three core beliefs; first, producers have the power to express unity with consumers. Secondly, the world trade practices that currently exist promote the unequal [[distribution of wealth]] between nations. Lastly, buying products from producers in developing countries at a fair price is a more efficient way of promoting sustainable development than traditional charity and aid.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Fair Trade from the Ground Up|last = Linton|first = April|publisher = University of Washington Press|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0-295-99172-6|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fair trade labelling organizations commonly use a definition of ''fair trade'' developed by [[FINE]], an informal association of four international fair trade networks: [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]], [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (WFTO), [[Network of European Worldshops]] and [[European Fair Trade Association]] (EFTA). Specifically, fair trade is a trading partnership, based on dialogue, [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]], and respect, that seeks greater equity in international trade. Fair trade organizations, backed by consumers, are engaged actively in supporting producers, [[raising awareness|awareness raising]], and in campaigning for changes in the rules and practice of conventional international trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = What | publisher = European fair trade association | url = http://www.european-fair-trade-association.org/efta/Doc/What.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several recognized fair trade certifiers, including [[FLO International|Fairtrade International]] (formerly called FLO, Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International), IMO, [[Make Trade Fair]] and Eco-Social. Additionally, [[Fair Trade USA]], formerly a licensing agency for the Fairtrade International label, broke from the system and is implementing its own fair trade labelling scheme, which has resulted in controversy due to its inclusion of independent smallholders and estates for all crops. In 2008, Fairtrade International certified approximately (€3.4B) of products.&lt;ref name="FLO2008"&gt;{{Citation | title = Facts &amp; figures | publisher = Fair trade | url = http://www.fairtrade.net/facts_and_figures.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = WTO | url = http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/statis_e/its2006_e/its06_general_overview_e.pdf |format=PDF |title= General overview | year = 2006 | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Trade Organization]] publishes annual figures on the world trade of goods and services.

The fair trade movement is popular in the UK, where there are 500 Fairtrade towns, 118 universities, over 6,000 churches, and over 4,000 UK schools registered in the Fairtrade Schools Scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Paull | first = J | year = 2011 | contribution-url = http://orgprints.org/19527/1/Paull2011FairtradeISOFAR.pdf | contribution = The Fairtrade movement: Six lessons for the organics sector | title = Proceedings of the Third Scientific Conference of the International Society of Organic Agriculture Research | place = Namyangju, Korea | pages = 317–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, over 1.2 million farmers and workers in more than 60 countries participated in Fairtrade International's fair trade system, which included €65 million in fairtrade premium paid to producers for use developing their communities.&lt;ref name="fairtrade2009"&gt;{{Citation | title = Annual report | publisher = Fair trade | format = PDF | year = 2009 | url = http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/resources/2011-12_AnnualReport_web_version_small_FairtradeInternational.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fairtrade International, nearly six out of ten consumers have seen the Fairtrade mark and almost nine in ten of them trust it.&lt;ref name="fairtrade2009"/&gt;

Some criticisms have been raised about fair trade systems. One 2015 study in a journal published by the [[MIT Press]] concluded that producer benefits were close to zero because there was an oversupply of certification, and only a fraction of produce classified as fair trade was actually sold on fair trade markets, just enough to recoup the costs of certification.&lt;ref name="mitpressjournals.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Janvry|first1=Alain|last2=McIntosh|first2=Craig|last3=Sadoulet|first3=Elisabeth|title=Fair Trade and Free Entry: Can a Disequilibrium Market Serve as a Development Tool?|journal=The Review of Economics and Statistics|date=July 2015|volume=97|issue=3|pages=567–73|doi=10.1162/REST_a_00512}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research indicates that the implementation of certain fair trade standards can cause greater inequalities in some markets where these rigid rules are inappropriate for the specific market.&lt;ref name="Booth, P 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Booth | first1 = P. | last2 = Whetstone | first2 = L. | year = 2007 | title = Half a Cheer for Fair Trade | url = | journal = Economic Affairs | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 29–36 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0270.2007.00727.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perso2010"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carimentrand|first1= A.|last2= Ballet|first2= J. |year=2010|title= When Fair Trade increases unfairness: The case of quinoa from Bolivia|url= http://ethique.perso.sfr.fr/Working%20paper%20FREE-Cahier%20FREE%20n%B05-2010.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doppler, F. 2006"&gt;Working paper FREE-Cahier FREE n°5-2010; Doppler, F., &amp; Cabañas, A.A.

Some suppliers use relationships started in a fair trade system to autonomously springboard into direct sales relationships they negotiate themselves, whereas other direct trade systems are supplier-initiated for social responsibility reasons similar to a fair trade system.

== System ==
There are a large number of fair trade and ethical marketing organizations employing different [[marketing strategies]].{{Sfn | Ballet | Carimentrand | 2010}} Most fair trade marketers believe it is necessary to sell the products through supermarkets to get a sufficient [[volume of trade]] to affect the developing world.{{Sfn | Ballet | Carimentrand | 2010}} The Fairtrade brand is by far the biggest of the fair trade [[coffee]] brands.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Packers in developed countries pay a fee to The Fairtrade Foundation for the right to use the brand and logo, and nearly all the fee goes to marketing. Packers and retailers can charge as much as they want for the coffee. The coffee has to come from a certified fair trade cooperative, and there is a minimum price when the world market is oversupplied. Additionally, the cooperatives are paid an additional 10c per lb premium by buyers for [[community development]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bowes | first = John | year = 2010 | title = The Fair Trade Revolution | place = London | publisher = Pluto Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Pages needed |date=December 2014}} The cooperatives can, on average, sell only a third of their output as fair trade, because of lack of demand, and sell the rest at world prices.{{Sfn | Mohan | 2010}}{{Pages needed | date = December 2014}}{{Sfn | Kilian | Jones | Pratt | Villalobos | 2006}}{{Sfn | Berndt | 2007}}{{Sfn | Kohler | 2006}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Renard | first1 = MC | first2 = VP | last2 = Grovas | year = 2007 | chapter = 9.

Some meet other costs. Some is spent on social projects such as building schools, health clinics and baseball pitches. Sometimes there is money left over for the farmers. The cooperatives sometimes pay farmers a higher price than farmers do, sometimes less, but there is no evidence on which is more common.&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections"&gt;{{Citation | last = Speaker | first = Griffiths | title = Why Fair trade isn't | url = http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm}}{{Self-published source|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The marketing system for fair trade and non-fair trade coffee is identical in the consuming countries, using mostly the same importing, packing, distributing and retailing firms. Some independent brands operate a "virtual company", paying importers, packers and distributors and advertising agencies to handle their brand, for cost reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, IA and A Crane, "Ethical Decision Making in Fair Trade Companies". ''Journal of Business Ethics'' 45: 79–92, 2003. p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; In the producing country, fair trade is marketed only by fair trade cooperatives, while other coffee is marketed by fair trade cooperatives (as uncertified coffee), by other cooperatives and by ordinary traders.{{Sfn | Mohan | 2010}}{{Sfn | Kilian | Jones | Pratt | &amp; Villalobos | 2006}}{{Sfn | Berndt | 2007}}{{Sfn | Riedel | Lopez | Widdows | Manji | 2005}}{{Sfn | Kohler | 2006}}

To become certified fair trade producers, the primary cooperative and its member farmers must operate to certain political standards, imposed from Europe. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="FLOCERT"&gt;{{Citation | title = FLO-Cert | url = http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090918131636/http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en | archivedate = 2009-09-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[fair trade debate]] there are many complaints of failure to enforce these standards, with producers, cooperatives, importers and packers profiting by evading them.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, LT 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Utting, K 2009, p 139"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = J | last1 = Valkila| last2 = Haaparanta | first2 = P | last3 = Niemi | first3 = N | year = 2010 | title = Empowering Coffee Traders?

== Effect on growers ==
Fair trade is benefiting farmers in developing countries, whether that be considerably or just a little. The nature of fair trade makes it a global phenomenon, therefore, there are diverse motives for understanding group formation related to fair trade. The social transformation caused by the fair trade movement also varies around the world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

[[File:Young women soil testing.jpg|thumb|Three young Nicaraguan women demonstrate to visiting US buyers and consumers the use of organic soil testing methods.|alt=Teaching organic soil testing in Nicaragua.]]

A study of coffee growers in [Guatemala illustrates the effect of fair trade practices on growers. In this study, thirty-four farmers were interviewed. Of those thirty-four growers, twenty-two had an understanding of fair trade based on internationally recognized definitions, for example, describing fair trade in market and economical terms or knowing what the social premium is and how their cooperative has used it. Three growers explained a deep understanding of fair trade, showing a knowledge of both fair market principles and how fair trade affects them socially. Nine growers had erroneous or no knowledge of Fair Trade.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The three growers who had a deeper knowledge of the social implications of fair trade all have responsibilities within their cooperatives. One is a manager, one is in charge of the wet mill, and one is his group's treasurer. These farmers did not have a pattern in terms of years of education, age, or years of membership in the cooperative; their answers to the questions, "Why did you join?" differentiate them from other members and explain why they have such an extensive knowledge of fair trade. These farmers cited switching to organic farming, wanting to raise money for social projects, and more training offered as reasons for joining the cooperative, other than receiving a better price for their coffee.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Many farmers around the world are unaware of fair trade practices that they could be implementing to earn a higher wage. Coffee is one of the most highly traded commodities in the world, yet the farmers who grow it typically earn less than $2 a day.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Fair Trade Awareness and Engagement: A Coffee Farmer's Perspective|last = Fergus|first = Andrew|date = 2014|journal = Journal of the Center of Business Ethics, Bentley University|doi = 10.1111/basr.12037|pmid = |last2 = Gray |volume=119 |issue = 3|pages=359–384}}&lt;/ref&gt; When surveyed, farmers from Cooperativa Agraria Cafetalera Pangoa (CAC Pangoa) in San Martín de Pangoa, Peru, could answer positively that they have heard about fair trade, but were not able to give a detailed description about what fair trade is. They could, however, identify fair trade based on some of its possible benefits to their community. When asked, overall, farmers cited that fair trade has had a positive effect on their lives and communities. They also wanted consumers to know that fair trade is important for supporting their families and their [[cooperatives]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some producers also profit from the indirect benefits of fair trade practices. Fair trade cooperatives create a space of solidarity and promote an entrepreneurial spirit among growers. When growers feel like they have control over their own lives within the network of their cooperative, it can be very empowering. Operating a profitable business allows growers to think about their future, rather than worrying about how they are going to survive in poverty.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As far as farmers' satisfaction with the fair trade system, the growers want consumers to know that fair trade has provided important support to their families and their cooperative. Overall, farmers are satisfied with the current fair trade system, but some farmers, such as the Mazaronquiari group from CAC Pangoa, desire yet a higher price for their products in order to live a higher quality of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Social premium ===
A component of trade is the social premium that buyers of fair trade goods pay to the producers or producer-groups of such goods. An important factor of the fair trade social premium is that the producers or producer-groups decide where and how it is spent. These premiums usually go towards socioeconomic development, wherever the producers or producer-groups see fit. Within producer-groups, the decisions about how the social premium will be spent is handled democratically, with transparency and participation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Producers and producer-groups spend this social premium to support socioeconomic development in a variety of ways. One common way to spend the social premium of fair trade is to privately invest in public goods that infrastructure and the government are lacking in. These public goods include environment initiatives, public schools, and water projects. At some point, all producer-groups re-invest their social premium back into their farms and businesses. They buy capital, like trucks and machinery, and education for their members, like organic farming education. Thirty-eight percent of producer-groups spend the social premium in its entirety on themselves, but the rest invest in public goods, like paying for teachers' salaries, providing a community health care clinic, and improving infrastructure, such as bringing in electricity and bettering roads.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Farmers' organisations that use their social premium for public goods often finance educational scholarships. For example, Costa Rican coffee co-operative, Coocafé, has supported hundreds of children and youth at school and university through the financing of scholarships from funding from their fair trade social premium. In terms of education, the social premium can be used to build and furnish schools too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 50 Reasons to Buy Fair Trade|last = Litvinoff|first = Miles|publisher = Pluto Press|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-7453-2584-2|location = |pages = |last2 = Madeley|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations promoting fair trade ==
Most of the fair trade import organizations are members of, or certified by one of several national or international federations. These federations coordinate, promote, and facilitate the work of fair trade organizations. The following are some of the largest:
* The [[FLO International]] (Fairtrade International), created in 1997, is an association of three producer networks and twenty national labeling initiatives that develop Fairtrade standards, license buyers, label usage and market the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark|Fair trade Certification Mark]] in consuming countries. The Fairtrade International labeling system is the largest and most widely recognized standard setting and certification body for [[Fairtrade labeling|labeled Fair trade]]. Formerly named Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International, it changed its name to Fairtrade International in 2009, when its producer certification and standard setting activities were separated into two separate, but connected entities. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="FLOCERT" /&gt; Fairtrade International, the non-profit arm, oversees standards development and licensing organization activity. Only products from certain developing countries are eligible for certification, and for some products such as coffee and cocoa, certification is restricted to cooperatives. Cooperatives and large estates with hired labor may be certified for bananas, tea and other crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Fair trade | contribution = Generic standards | contribution-url = http://www.fairtrade.net/generic_standards.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fair Trade USA&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Fair trade | url = http://fairtradeusa.org/ | place = US}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an independent, nonprofit organization that sets standards, certifies, and labels products that promote sustainable livelihoods for farmers and workers and protect the environment. Founded in 1998, Fair Trade USA currently partners with around 800 brands, as well as 1.3 million farmers and workers across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | year = 2014 | title = General media kit | publisher = Fair trade | place = US | format = PDF | url = http://fairtradeusa.org/sites/default/files/General%20Media%20Kit%202014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Global Goods Partners]] (GGP), a fair-trade nonprofit organization, founded in 2005, which provides support and U.S. market access to women-led cooperatives in the developing world. 
* [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (formerly the International Fair Trade Association) is a global association created in 1989 of fair trade producer cooperatives and associations, export marketing companies, importers, retailers, national, and regional fair trade networks and fair trade support organizations. In 2004 WFTO launched the FTO Mark which identifies registered fair trade organizations (as opposed to the FLO system, which labels products).
* The [[Network of European Worldshops]] (NEWS!), created in 1994, is the umbrella network of 15 national [[worldshop]] associations in 13 different countries all over Europe.
* The [[European Fair Trade Association]] (EFTA), created in 1990, is a network of European [[alternative trading organization]]s which import products from some 400 economically disadvantaged producer groups in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. EFTA's goal is to promote fair trade and to make fair trade importing more efficient and effective. The organization also publishes yearly various publications on the evolution of the fair trade market. EFTA currently has eleven members in nine different countries.

In 1998, the first four federations listed above joined together as [[FINE]], an informal association whose goal is to harmonize fair trade standards and guidelines, increase the quality and efficiency of fair trade monitoring systems, and advocate fair trade politically.
* Additional certifiers include IMO (Fair for Life, Social and Fair Trade labels), Eco-Social and Fair Trade USA.
* The [[Fair Trade Federation]] (FTF), created in 1994, is an association of Canadian and American fair trade wholesalers, importers, and retailers. The organization links its members to fair trade producer groups while acting as a clearinghouse for information on fair trade and providing resources and networking opportunities to its members. Members self-certify adherence to defined fair trade principles for 100% of their purchasing/business. Those who sell products certifiable by Fairtrade International must be 100% certified by FI to join FTF.

Student groups have also been increasingly active in the past years promoting fair trade products.&lt;ref name="fairtradecampaigns.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairtradecampaigns.org/campaign-type/universities/ |title=Universities &amp;#124; Campaign Types |publisher=Fair Trade Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although hundreds of independent student organizations are active worldwide, most groups in North America are either affiliated with United Students for Fair Trade (USA, the Canadian Student Fair Trade Network (Canada), or Fair Trade Campaigns&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairtradecampaigns.org/|title=Fair Trade Campaigns|website=fairtradecampaigns.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (USA), which also houses Fair Trade Universities&lt;ref name="fairtradecampaigns.org" /&gt; and Fair Trade Schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairtradecampaigns.org/campaign-type/schools/ |title=Schools &amp;#124; Campaign Types |publisher=Fair Trade Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The involvement of church organizations has been and continues to be an integral part of the Fair Trade movement:

== History ==
{{Main article|History of fair trade}}
The first attempts to commercialize fair trade goods in Northern markets were initiated in the 1940s and 1950s by religious groups and various politically oriented [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs). Ten Thousand Villages, an NGO within the [[Mennonite Central Committee]] (MCC) and [[SERRV International]] were the first, in 1946 and 1949 respectively, to develop fair trade [[supply chain]]s in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = History | url = http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history3.shtml | publisher = IFAT | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061215142239/http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history3.shtml | archivedate = 2006-12-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The products, almost exclusively handicrafts ranging from [[jute]] goods to [[cross-stitch]] work, were mostly sold in churches or fairs. The goods themselves had often no other function than to indicate that a donation had been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Unisg | title = Oikos foundation | url = http://www.oikos-foundation.unisg.ch/homepage/fairtrade.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060823071706/http://www.oikos-foundation.unisg.ch/homepage/fairtrade.pdf | archivedate = 2006-08-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solidarity trade ===
[[File:Fair Trade Products.jpg|thumb|Fair trade goods sold in worldshops]]
The current fair trade movement was shaped in Europe in the 1960s. Fair trade during that period was often seen as a political gesture against neo-imperialism: radical student movements began targeting multinational corporations and concerns that traditional business models were fundamentally flawed started to emerge. The slogan at the time, "Trade not Aid", gained international recognition in 1968 when it was adopted by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) to put the emphasis on the establishment of fair trade relations with the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | archivedate = October 22, 2014 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141022065406/http://www.wfto.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=17&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=1 | url = http://www.wfto.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=17&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=1 |title= Where did it all begin?| accessdate = 24 June 2009 | date = 7 June 2009|publisher= WFTO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 1965 saw the creation of the first [[Alternative Trading Organization]] (ATO): that year, British NGO [[Oxfam]] launched "Helping-by-Selling", a program which sold imported handicrafts in Oxfam stores in the UK and from mail-order catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = One Village | place = Charlbury, UK |url= http://onevillage.org/fairtrade-history.htm |title = Fair trade history | last = Scott | first = Roy | date=2003-03-07 |accessdate= 2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1968, the oversized newsprint publication, the [[Whole Earth Catalog]], was connecting thousands of specialized merchants, artisans, and scientists directly with consumers who were interested in supporting independent producers, with the goal of bypassing corporate retail and department stores. The Whole Earth Catalog sought to balance the international free market by allowing direct purchasing of goods produced primarily in US and Canada, but also in Central and South America.

In 1969, the first [[worldshop]] opened its doors in the Netherlands. The initiative aimed at bringing the principles of fair trade to the retail sector by selling almost exclusively goods produced under fair trade terms in "underdeveloped regions". The first shop was run by volunteers and was so successful that dozens of similar shops soon went into business in the [[Benelux]] countries, Germany, and other Western European countries.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, important segments of the fair trade movement worked to find markets for products from countries that were excluded from the mainstream trading channels for political reasons. Thousands of volunteers sold coffee from Angola and Nicaragua in worldshops, in the back of churches, from their homes, and from stands in public places, using the products as a vehicle to deliver their message: give disadvantaged producers in developing countries a fair chance on the world's market.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}}

=== Handicrafts vs. agricultural goods ===
In the early 1980s, [[Alternative Trading Organizations]] faced major challenges: the novelty of some fair trade products began to wear off, demand reached a plateau, and some handicrafts began to look "tired and old fashioned" in the marketplace. The decline of segments of the handicrafts market forced fair trade supporters to rethink their business model and their goals. Moreover, several fair trade supporters during this period were worried by the contemporary effect on small farmers of structural reforms in the agricultural sector as well as the fall in [[commodity]] prices. Many of them came to believe it was the movement's responsibility to address the issue and remedies usable in the ongoing crisis in the industry.

In the subsequent years, fair trade agricultural commodities played an important role in the growth of many ATOs: successful on the market, they offered a much-needed, renewable source of income for producers and provided Alternative Trading Organizations a complement to the handicrafts market. The first fair trade agricultural products were tea and coffee, quickly followed by: dried fruits, cocoa, sugar, fruit juices, rice, spices and nuts. While in 1992, a sales value ratio of 80% handcrafts to 20% agricultural goods was the norm, in 2002 handcrafts amounted to 25% of fair trade sales while commodity food lines were up at 69%.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, A. &amp; Opal, C. (2004). Fair Trade: Market-Driven Ethical Consumption. London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rise of labeling initiatives ===
[[File:Oldftlogos2.jpg|thumb|Early Fairtrade Certifications Marks]]&lt;!-- FAIR USE of Oldftlogos2.jpg: see image description page at [[:File:Oldftlogos2.jpg]] for rationale --&gt;Sales of fair trade products only really took off with the arrival of the first [[Fairtrade certification]] initiatives. Although buoyed by ever growing sales, fair trade had been generally contained to relatively small worldshops scattered across Europe and to a lesser extent, North America. Some felt that these shops were too disconnected from the rhythm and the lifestyle of contemporary developed societies. The inconvenience of going to them to buy only a product or two was too high even for the most dedicated customers. The only way to increase sale opportunities was to start offering fair trade products where consumers normally shop, in large distribution channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0743-0167(02)00051-7 | last = Renard | first = M-C | year= 2003| title = Fair Trade: quality, market and conventions | url = |journal=Journal of Rural Studies|volume=19 | pages =87–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was to find a way to expand distribution without compromising consumer trust in fair trade products and in their origins.

A solution was found in 1988, when the first Fairtrade certification initiative, [[Stichting Max Havelaar|Max Havelaar]], was created in the Netherlands under the initiative of [[Nico Roozen]], [[Frans Van Der Hoff]], and Dutch development NGO [[Solidaridad]]. The independent certification allowed the goods to be sold outside the worldshops and into the mainstream, reaching a larger consumer segment and boosting fair trade sales significantly. The [[Fairtrade labelling|labeling initiative]] also allowed customers and distributors alike to track the origin of the goods to confirm that the products were really benefiting the producers at the end of the supply chain.

The concept caught on: in the ensuing years, similar non-profit Fairtrade labelling organizations were set up in other European countries and North America. In 1997, a process of convergence among labelling organizations – or "LIs" (for "Labeling Initiatives") – led to the creation of Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (FLO). FLO is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers, and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/tasks.html | title = Main Tasks | work = Fair trade | accessdate = 27 January 2009 | year=2006 | publisher = FLO International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, FLO launched for the first time an International Fairtrade Certification Mark. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the Mark on supermarket shelves, facilitate cross border trade, and simplify procedures for both producers and importers. At present, the certification mark is used in over 50 countries and on dozens of different products, based on FLO's certification for coffee, tea, rice, bananas, mangoes, cocoa, cotton, sugar, honey, fruit juices, nuts, fresh fruit, quinoa, herbs and spices, wine, [[Football (ball)|footballs]], etc.

With the rise of ethical labeling, consumers are able to take moral responsibility for their economic decisions and actions. This supports the notion of fair trade practices as "moral economies."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The presence of labeling give consumers the feeling of "doing the right thing" with a simple purchase.

These labeling practices place the burden of getting certification on the producers in the Global South, furthering inequality between the Global North and the Global South. The process of securing certification is excessively burdensome and expensive. Northern consumers are able to just make a simple choice without these burdens and expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Alternative production and consumption relations?: fair trade, the state, and cooperatives in the global South|journal = Journal of Contemporary African Studies|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 0258-9001|pages = 1–17|volume = 31|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/02589001.2012.752958|first = Michelle|last = Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychology ==
Consumers of fair trade products usually make the intentional choice to purchase fair trade goods based on attitude, moral norms, perceived behavioral control, and social norms. It is useful to include of measure of moral norms to improve the predictive power of intentions to buy fair trade over the basic predictors, like attitude and perceived behavioral control.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

University students have significantly increased their consumption of fair trade products over the last several decades. Women college students have a more favorable attitude than men toward buying fair trade products and they feel more morally obligated to do so. Women are also reported to have stronger intentions to buy fair trade products.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Gender Differences in Psychosocial Determinants of University Students' Intentions to Buy Fair Trade Products|last = Valois|first = Pierre|date = 16 May 2014|journal = Journal of Consumer Policy|doi = 10.1007/s10603-014-9262-4|pmid = |last2 = de Leeuw|last3 = Morin|last4 = Schmidt |volume=37 |issue = 4|pages=485–505}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to the intentions to buy fair trade products, gender had no direct effect.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Producers organize and strive for fair trade certification for several reasons, either through religious ties, wants for social justice, wants for autonomy, political liberalization, or simply because they want to be paid more for their labor efforts and products. Farmers are more likely to identify with [[organic farming]] than fair trade farming practices because organic farming is a very visible way that these farmers are different than their neighbors and it actually influences the way they farm. They place a significant importance on natural growing methods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fair trade farmers are also more likely to attribute their higher paid prices to the quality of their products rather than fair market prices.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Product certification ==
{{Main article|Fair trade certification}}
''Note: Customary spelling of Fairtrade is one word when referring to the FLO product labeling system, see [[Fairtrade certification]]''
[[File:Fairtrade Certification Mark.svg|thumb|200px|International Fairtrade Certification Mark]]
Fairtrade labelling (usually simply Fairtrade or Fair Trade Certified in the United States) is a certification system designed to allow consumers to identify goods which meet agreed standards. Overseen by a standard-setting body ([[FLO International]]) and a certification body ([[FLO-CERT]]), the system involves independent auditing of producers and traders to ensure the agreed standards are met. For a product to carry either the International Fairtrade Certification Mark or the [[Fair Trade Certified Mark]], it must come from FLO-CERT inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be grown and harvested in accordance with the international Fair trade standards set by FLO International. The supply chain must also have been monitored by FLO-CERT, to ensure the integrity of the labelled product.

Fairtrade certification purports to guarantee not only fair prices, but also the principles of [[ethical purchasing]]. These principles include adherence to ILO agreements such as those banning child and [[slave labour]], guaranteeing a safe workplace and the right to unionise, adherence to the [[United Nations]] charter of [[human rights]], a fair price that covers the cost of production and facilitates social development, and protection and conservation of the environment. The Fairtrade certification system also attempts to promote long-term business relationships between buyers and sellers, crop prefinancing, and greater transparency throughout the supply chain and more.

The Fairtrade certification system covers a growing range of products, including bananas, honey, coffee, oranges, Cocoa bean, cocoa, cotton, dried and fresh fruits and vegetables, juices, nuts and oil seeds, quinoa, rice, spices, sugar, tea, and wine. Companies offering products that meet the Fairtrade standards may apply for licences to use one of the Fairtrade Certification Marks for those products. The International Fairtrade Certification Mark was launched in 2002 by FLO, and replaced twelve Marks used by various Fairtrade labelling initiatives. The new Certification Mark is currently used worldwide (with the exception of the United States). The Fair Trade Certified Mark is still used to identify Fairtrade goods in the United States.

There is widespread confusion because the fair trade industry standards provided by Fairtrade International (The Fairtrade Labelling Organization) use the word "producer" in many different senses, often in the same specification document. Sometimes it refers to farmers, sometimes to the primary cooperatives they belong to, to the secondary cooperatives that the primary cooperatives belong to, or to the tertiary cooperatives that the secondary cooperatives may belong to&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-07-11_SPO_EN.pdf Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.

== WFTO Fair Trade Organization membership ==
In an effort to complement the Fairtrade product certification system and allow most notably handcraft producers to also sell their products outside worldshops, the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO) launched in 2004 a new Mark to identify fair trade organizations (as opposed to products in the case of FLO International and Fairtrade). Called the FTO Mark,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/the-fairtrade-marks.html |title=Fairtrade International (FLO): The Fairtrade Marks |publisher=Fairtrade.net |date=2017-09-17 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; it allows consumers to recognize registered Fair Trade Organizations worldwide and seeks to guarantee that standards are being implemented regarding working conditions, wages, child labour, and the environment. The FTO Mark offers Fair Trade Organizations (including [[handcrafts]] producers) definable standards which inform consumers, business partners, governments, and donors of the applicable trading standard. in 2014 the Fairtrade Program Mark was introduced to create new sales opportunities, initially for cocoa, sugar and cotton producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fairtrade-sourcing-programs.html |title=Fairtrade International (FLO): Fairtrade International |publisher=Fairtrade.net |date=2017-09-17 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the same round logo alongside the word '''FAIRTRADE''' in black and underneath the program title in '''&lt;span style="color:turquoise"&gt;turquoise&lt;/span&gt;'''.

== Alternative trading organizations ==
{{Main article|Alternative trading organization}}
[[File:Cafedirectcoffeeshop.JPG|thumb|right|[[Cafedirect]] coffee shop on [[Regent Street]] in central London.]]

An alternative trading organization (ATO) is usually a non-governmental organization (NGO) or mission-driven business aligned with the Fair Trade movement, aiming "to contribute to the alleviation of poverty in developing regions of the world by establishing a system of trade that allows marginalized producers in developing regions to gain access to developed markets".&lt;ref name="European Fair 1998 p.23 &amp; 25"&gt;European Fair Trade Association (1998). Fair Trade Yearbook: Towards 2000. p.23 &amp; 25&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative trading organizations have Fair Trade at the core of their mission and activities, using it as a development tool to support disadvantaged producers and to [[poverty reduction|reduce poverty]], and combine their marketing with awareness-raising and campaigning.

Alternative trading organizations are often, but not always, based in political and religious groups, though their secular purpose precludes sectarian identification and evangelical activity. Philosophically, the grassroots political-action agenda of these organizations associates them with progressive political causes active since the 1960s: foremost, a belief in [[collective action]] and commitment to moral principles based on social, economic and [[trade justice]].

According to EFTA, the defining characteristic of alternative trading organizations is that of equal partnership and respect – partnership between the developing region producers and importers, shops, labelling organizations, and consumers. Alternative trade "humanizes" the trade process – making the producer-consumer chain as short as possible so that consumers become aware of the culture, identity, and conditions in which producers live. All actors are committed to the principle of alternative trade, the need for advocacy in their working relations and the importance of awareness-raising and advocacy work.&lt;ref name="European Fair 1998 p.23 &amp; 25" /&gt; Examples of such organisations are Ten Thousand Villages, Greenheart Shop, [[Equal Exchange]] and SERRV International in the US and [[Equal Exchange Trading]], [[Traidcraft]], Oxfam Trading, [[Twin Trading]] and Alter Eco in Europe as well as Siem Fair Trade Fashion in Australia.

== Universities ==
The concept of a Fair Trade school or Fair Trade university emerged from the [[United Kingdom]], where the Fairtrade Foundation now maintains a list of colleges and schools that comply with the needed requirements to be labeled such a university. In order to be considered a Fair Trade University, a school or university must have established a Fairtrade School Steering Group. They must have a written and implemented a school-wide Fair Trade Policy. The school or university must be dedicated to selling and using Fair Trade products. They have to learn and educate about Fair Trade issues. Finally, the Fairtrade Foundation requires that schools promote Fair Trade not only within the school, but throughout the wider community.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A Fair Trade University is one that develops all aspects of Fair Trade practices in their coursework. In 2007, the Director of the Environmental Studies program at the [[University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh]], David Barnhill, started a push to become the first Fair Trade University. This push received positive reactions from faculty and students. To begin the process, the University as a whole agreed that it would need support from four institutional groups—faculty, staff, support staff, and students—to maximize support and educational efforts. The University officially endorsed the Earth Charter and created a Campus Sustainability Plan to align with the efforts of becoming a Fair Trade University.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The University of Wisconsin- Oshkosh also offers many courses in many different disciplines that implement fair trade learning. They offer a business course with a trip to [[Peru]] to visit coffee farmers, an environmental science class that discusses fair trade as a way for cleaner food systems, an English course that focuses on the [[Earth Charter]] and the application of fair trade principles, and several upper-level anthropology courses make fair trade the center of the class.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sustainability in Higher Education|last = Feldman|first = James|publisher = The MIT Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0-262-01949-1|location = |pages = 241–248|last2 = Barnhill|jstor = j.ctt9qf6bw.26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 2010, the [[University of California, San Diego]] became the second Fair Trade University in the United States. The University of California at San Diego understood the efforts of the Fairtrade Foundation in the UK, but they recognized they wanted to be more detailed about how their declaration as a Fair Trade University would make an actual change in the way on-campus franchises do business with the university. They also required constant assessment and improvement. The main premise of being a Fair Trade University for the University of California at San Diego is the promise between the university and the students about the continual effort by the university to increase the accessibility of Fair Trade Certified food and drinks and to encourage sustainability in other ways, such as buying from local, organic farmers and decreasing waste.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Fair Trade Universities have been successful because they are a "feel good" movement. The movement also has an established history, making it a true movement rather just a fad. Thirdly, Fair Trade Universities are effective because they raise awareness about an issue and offer a solution. The solution is an easy one for college students to handle, just paying about five cents more for a cup of coffee or tea can make a real difference.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Worldshops ==
{{Main article|Worldshop}}
[[File:Oxfam shop on Drury Lane.jpg|thumb|[[Oxfam#Shops|Oxfam shop]] on [[Drury Lane]] in [[Covent Garden]], [[London]]]]
Worldshops or fair trade shops are specialized retail outlets offering and promoting fair trade products. Worldshops also typically organize various educational fair trade activities and play an active role in trade justice and other North-South political campaigns. Worldshops are often [[not-for-profit]] organizations and run by locally based volunteer networks. Although the movement emerged in Europe and a vast majority of worldshops are still based on the continent, worldshops can also be found today in North America, Australia and New Zealand.

Worldshops' aim is to make trade as direct and fair with the trading partners as possible. Usually, this means a producer in a [[developing country]] and consumers in [[industrialisation|industrialized]] countries. The worldshops' target is to pay the producers a fair price that guarantees substinence and guarantees positive social development. They often cut out any intermediaries in the import chain. A web movement has begun in the 2000s to provide fair trade items at fair prices to the consumers. One popular one is Fair Trade a Day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairtradeaday.com/|title=fairtradeday.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a different fair trade item is featured each day.

Every year the sales of Fair Trade products grow close to 30% and in 2004 were worth over $500 million USD. In the case of coffee, sales grow nearly 50% per year in certain countries.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2004"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Raynolds | first1 = Laura T | first2 = Douglas | last2 = Murray | first3 = Peter Leigh | last3 = Taylor | title = Fair Trade Coffee: Building Producers Capacity Via Global Networks | journal = Journal of International Development | year = 2004 | pages = 1109–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, 16,000 tons of Fairtrade coffee was purchased by consumers in 17 countries.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2004" /&gt; "Fair trade coffee is currently produced in 24 countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia".&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2004" /&gt; The 165 FLO associations in Latin America and Caribbean are located in 14 countries and together export over 85% of the world's Fair Trade coffee.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2004" /&gt; There is a North/South divide of fair trade products with producers in the South and consumers in the North.

=== Africa ===
Africa's exports come from the places such as South Africa, Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. These exports are valued at $24 million USD.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2009"&gt;Raynolds, Laura T., and Siphelo Unathi Ngcwangu. "Fair Trade Rooibos Tea: Connecting South African Producers and American Consumer Markets." Geoforum (2009): 74-83. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the years of 2004 and 2006 Africa quickly expanded their number of FLO certified producer groups, rising from 78 to 171; nearly half of which reside in Kenya, following closely behind are Tanzania and South Africa.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2009" /&gt; The FLO products Africa is known for are tea, cocoa, flowers and wine.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2009" /&gt; In Africa there are smallholder cooperatives and plantations which produce Fair Trade certified tea.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2009" /&gt; Cocoa-producing countries in West Africa often form cooperatives that produce [[fair trade cocoa]] such as [[Kuapa Kokoo]] in [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; West African countries without strong fair trade industries are subject to deterioration in cocoa quality as they compete with other countries for a profit. These countries include [[Cameroon]], [[Nigeria]], and the [[Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

=== Latin America ===
Studies in the early 2000s show that the income, education and health of coffee producers involved with Fair Trade in Latin America were improved, versus producers who were not participating.&lt;ref name="Geiger-Onteo, Stephanie 2011"&gt;Geiger-Onteo, Stephanie, and Eric J. Arnould. "Alternative Trade Organization and Subjective Quality of Life: The Case of Latin American Coffee Producers." Journal of Macromarketing (2011): 276-290. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil, Nicaragua, Peru and Guatemala, having the biggest population of coffee producers, make use of some of the most substantial land for coffee production in Latin America and do so by taking part in Fair Trade.&lt;ref name="Geiger-Onteo, Stephanie 2011" /&gt; Countries in Latin America are also large exporters of [[fair trade bananas]]. The [[Dominican Republic]] is the largest producer of fair trade bananas, followed by [[Mexico]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Costa Rica]]. Producers in the Dominican Republic have set up associations rather than cooperatives so that individual farmers can each own their own land but meet regularly.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Fundación Solidaridad was created in [[Chile]] to increase the earnings and social participation of handicraft producers. These goods are marketed locally in Chile and internationally.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; Fair trade handicraft and jewellery production has also shown a significant uplift over recent years, aided by North American and European online retailers developing direct relationships to import and sell the products online. The sale of fair trade handicrafts online has been of particular importance in aiding the development of female artisans in Latin America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mixyfandino.com/empowering-the-female-artisan/|title=mixyfandino.com/empowering-the-female-artisan/|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===
The Asia Fair Trade Forum aims to increase the competency of fair trade organizations in Asia so they can be more competitive in the global market. Garment factories in Asian countries including [[China]], [[Burma]], and [[Bangladesh]] consistently receive charges of human rights violations, including the use of child labour.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; These violations conflict with the principles outlined by fair trade certifiers. In [[India]], Trade Alternative Reform Action (Tara) Projects formed in the 1970s have worked to increase production capacity, quality standards, and entrance into markets for home-based craftsmen that were previously unattainable due to their lower caste identity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

=== Australia ===
The Fair Trade Association of Australia and New Zealand (FTAANZ) is a member-based organization that supports two systems of fair trade. The first is the Australia and New Zealand member of FLO International, which unites Fairtrade producer and labelling initiatives across Europe, Asia, Latin America, North America, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The second, is the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO), of over 450 worldwide members, to which FTAANZ is one. Fairtrade (one word) refers to FLO certified commodity and associated products. Fair trade (two words) encompasses the wider Fair Trade movement, including the Fairtrade commodities and other artisan craft products.

==Commodities ==
Fair trade commodities are goods that have been exchanged from where they were grown or made to where they are purchased, and have been certified by a fair trade certification organization, such as [[Fair Trade USA]] or [[World Fair Trade Organization]]. Such organizations are typically overseen by Fairtrade International. Fairtrade International sets international fair trade standards and supports fair trade producers and cooperatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/about_us.html |title=Fairtrade International (FLO): Fairtrade International |publisher=Fairtrade.net |date=2017-09-17 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty percent of the fair trade market revolves around food products such as coffee, tea, cocoa, honey, and bananas.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura 2000"&gt;Raynolds, Laura. "Re-embedding Global Agriculture: The International Organic and Fair Trade Movements." Agriculture and Human Values 17.3 (2000): 297-309. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-food commodities include crafts, textiles, and flowers. It has been suggested by Shima Baradaran of Brigham Young University that fair trade techniques could be productively applied to products which might involve [[child labor]].&lt;ref name="Fair Trade and Child Labor"&gt;{{cite journal|first2=Stephanie H. |last2=Barclay|title=Fair Trade and Child Labor|journal=Columbia Human Rights Law Review, Forthcoming|date=April 26, 2011|ssrn=1823546|accessdate=|author=Shima Baradaran|quote=fair trade should be considered as a proven alternative to current strategies to eliminate child labor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although fair trade represents only .01% of the food and beverage industry in the United States, it is growing rapidly and may become a significant portion of the national food and beverage industry.&lt;ref&gt;Raynolds, Laura T., Douglas L. Murray, and John Wilkinson. Fair Trade: The Challenges of Transforming Globalization. London: Routledge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coffee ===
{{Main article|Fair trade coffee}}
[[File:Coffee beans being sorted and pulped.jpg|thumb|Fair trade [[coffee bean]]s being sorted]]
Coffee is the most well-established fair trade commodity. Most Fair Trade coffee is ''[[Coffea arabica]],'' a type of coffee known to be grown at high altitudes. A lot of emphasis is put on the quality of the coffee when dealing in Fair Trade markets because Fair Trade markets are usually specialized markets that appeal to customers who are motivated by taste rather than price. The Fair Trade movement fixated on coffee first because it is a highly traded commodity for most producing countries and almost half the world's coffee is produced by smallholder farmers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While initially sold at small scale, currently multinationals like Starbucks and Nestlé use fair trade coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Weak Coffee: Certification and Co-Optation in the Fair Trade Movement|url = http://socpro.oxfordjournals.org/content/59/1/94|journal = Social Problems|date = 2012-02-01|issn = 0037-7791|pages = 94–116|volume = 59|issue = 1|doi = 10.1525/sp.2012.59.1.94|first = Daniel|last = Jaffee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally recognized Fair Trade coffee standards have been outlined by FLO and are as follows: small producers are grouped in democratic cooperatives or groups, buyers and sellers establish long-term, stable relationships, buyers must pay the producers at least the minimum Fair Trade price or when the market price is higher, they must pay the market price, and finally, buyers must also pay a social premium of 20 cents per pound of coffee to the producers. The current minimum Fair Trade price for high-grade, washed Arabica coffee $1.40 per pound; the price increases to $1.70 per pound if the coffee is also organic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Locations ====
The largest sources of fair trade coffee are Uganda and Tanzania, followed by Latin American countries such as Guatemala and Costa Rica.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura 2000" /&gt; As of 1999, major importers of fair trade coffee included Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. There is a North/South divide between fair trade consumers and producers. North American countries are not yet among the top importers of fair trade coffee.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura 2000" /&gt;

==== Labour ====
Starbucks began to purchase more fair trade coffee in 2001 because of charges of labor rights violations in Central American plantations. Several competitors, including Nestlé, followed suit.&lt;ref name="Jaffee, Daniel 2012 pp. 94-116"&gt;Jaffee, Daniel: "Weak Coffee: Certification and Co-Optation in the Fair Trade Movement." Social Problems, Vol. 59, No. 1 (February 2012), pp. 94-116&lt;/ref&gt; Large corporations that sell non-fair trade coffee take 55% of what consumers pay for coffee while only 10% goes to the producers. Small growers dominate the production of coffee, especially in Latin American countries such as Peru. Coffee is the fastest expanding fairly traded commodity, and an increasing number of producers are small farmers that own their own land and work in cooperatives. Even the incomes of growers of fair trade coffee beans depend on the market value of coffee where it is consumed, so farmers of fair trade coffee do not necessarily live above the poverty line or get completely fair prices for their commodity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ransom, David. The No-nonsense Guide to Fair Trade. Oxford: New Internationalist Publications, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Unsustainable farming practices can harm plantation owners and laborers. Unsustainable practices such as using chemicals and unshaded growing are risky. Small growers who put themselves at economic risk by not having diverse farming practices could lose money and resources due to fluctuating coffee prices, pest problems, or policy shifts.&lt;ref name="Rice, Robert A 1999"&gt;Rice, Robert A (1999). "A Place Unbecoming: The Coffee Farm of Northern Latin America." Geographical Review: 89(4): 554-579.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of Fairtrade is questionable; workers on Fairtrade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the Fairtrade system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2014/05/agriculture-ethiopia-and-uganda?fsrc=scn/fb/wl/bl/notsofairtrade|accessdate=3 July 2014|title=Agriculture in Ethiopia and Uganda: Not so fair trade|work=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sustainability ====
As coffee becomes one of the most important export crops in certain regions such as northern Latin America, nature and agriculture are transformed. Increased productivity requires technological innovations, and the coffee agroecosystem has been changing rapidly. In the nineteenth century in Latin America, coffee plantations slowly began replacing sugarcane and subsistence crops. Coffee crops became more managed; they were put into rows and unshaded, meaning diversity of the forest was decreased and [[Coffea]] trees were shorter. As plant and tree diversity decreased, so did animal diversity. Unshaded plantations allow for a higher density of Coffea trees, but negative effects include less protection from wind and more easily eroded soil. Technified coffee plantations also use chemicals such as fertilizers, insecticides, and fungicides.&lt;ref name="Rice, Robert A 1999" /&gt;

Fair trade certified commodities must adhere to sustainable agro-ecological practices, including reduction of chemical fertilizer use, prevention of erosion, and protection of forests. Coffee plantations are more likely to be fair trade certified if they use traditional farming practices with shading and without chemicals. This protects the biodiversity of the ecosystem and ensures that the land will be usable for farming in the future and not just for short-term planting.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura 2000" /&gt; In the United States, 85% of fair trade certified coffee is also organic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;DeCarlo, Jacqueline. Fair Trade: A Beginner's Guide. Oxford, England: Oneworld, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Consumer attitudes ====
Consumers typically have positive attitudes for products that are ethically made. These products may include promises of fair labor conditions, protection of the environment, and protection of human rights. All fair trade products must meet standards such as these. Despite positive attitudes toward ethical products including fair trade commodities, consumers often are not willing to pay the higher price associated with fair trade coffee. The attitude-behavior gap can help explain why ethical and fair trade products take up less than 1% of the market. Coffee consumers can say they would be willing to pay a higher premium for fair trade coffee, but most consumers are actually more concerned with the brand, label, and flavor of the coffee. However, socially conscious consumers with a commitment to buying fair trade products are more likely to pay the premium associated with fair trade coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pelsmacker | first1 = De | last2 = Patrick | first2 = | last3 = Driesen | first3 = Liesbeth | last4 = Rayp | first4 = Glenn | year = 2005| title = Do Consumers Care about Ethics?

[[Safeway Inc.]] began carrying fair trade coffee after individual consumers dropped off postcards asking for it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Jaffee, Daniel.

=== Cocoa ===
Many countries that export [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] rely on cocoa as their single export crop. In Africa in particular, governments tax cocoa as their main source of revenue. Cocoa is a permanent crop, which means that it occupies land for long periods of time and does not need to be replanted after each harvest.&lt;ref name="Willer and Yussefi 2008"&gt;Willer, Helga; Yussefi-Menzler, Minou und Sorensen, Neil, (Hrsg.) (2008) "The World of Organic Agriculture – Statistics and Emerging Trends 2008." IFOAM, Bonn and FiBL, Frick&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Locations ====
Cocoa is farmed in the tropical regions of West Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. In Latin America, cocoa is produced in Costa Rica, Panama, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil. Much of the cocoa produced in Latin America is an organic and regulated by an [[Internal control]] system. Bolivia has fair trade cooperatives that permit a fair share of money for cocoa producers. African cocoa-producing countries include Cameroon, Madagascar, São Tomé and Príncipe, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, and Côte d'Ivoire.&lt;ref name="Willer and Yussefi 2008" /&gt; Côte d'Ivoire exports over a third of the world's cocoa beans.&lt;ref name="Brown, Michael Barratt 2007"&gt;Brown, Michael Barratt. "'Fair Trade' with Africa." Review of African Political Economy 34.112 (2007): 267-77&lt;/ref&gt; Southeast Asia accounts for about 14% of the world's cocoa production. Major cocoa-producing countries are Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldcocoafoundation.org/our-work/where-we-work/ |title=Where We Work |publisher=World Cocoa Foundation |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Labour ====
One suggestion for the reason that laborers in Africa are marginalized in world trade is because the colonial division of labor kept Africa from developing its own industries. Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fair trade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system.&lt;ref name="Brown, Michael Barratt 2007" /&gt; Most cocoa comes from small family-run farms in West Africa. These farms have little market access and thus rely on middlemen to bring their products to market. Sometimes middlemen are unfair to farmers. Farmers do not get a fair price for their product despite relying on cocoa sales for the majority of their income.&lt;ref name="Houston, Holly 2012"&gt;Houston, Holly, and Terry Wyer. "Why Sustainable Cocoa Farming Matters for Rural Development." Center for Strategic and International Studies, 6 Sept. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an [[Agricultural cooperative]]. Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodman | first1 = Michael K | year = 2004 | title = Reading fairtrade: political ecological imaginary and the moral economy of fairtrade foods | url = | journal = Political Geography | volume = 23 | issue = 7| pages = 891–915 | doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2004.05.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. In reality, much of this money goes to community projects such as water wells rather than to individual farmers. Nevertheless, cooperatives such as fair trade-endorsed [[Kuapa Kokoo]] in Ghana are often the only Licensed Buying Companies that will give farmers a fair price and not cheat them or rig sales.&lt;ref name="Berlan, Amanda 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berlan | first1 = Amanda | year = 2008 | title = Making or Marketing a Difference? An Anthropological Examination of the Marketing of Fair Trade Cocoa from Ghana | url = | journal = Research in Economic Anthropology | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 171–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers in cooperatives are frequently their own bosses and get bonuses per bag of cocoa beans. These arrangements are not always assured and fair trade organizations can't always buy all of the cocoa available to them from cooperatives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==== Marketing ====
The marketing of fair trade cocoa to European consumers often portrays the cocoa farmers as dependent on western purchases for their livelihood and well-being. Showing African cocoa producers in this way is problematic because it is reminiscent of the imperialistic view that Africans cannot live happily without the help of westerners. It puts the balance of power in favor of the consumers rather than the producers.&lt;ref name="Berlan, Amanda 2008" /&gt;

Consumers often aren't willing to pay the extra price for fair trade cocoa because they do not know what fair trade is. Activist groups are vital in educating consumers about the unethical aspects of unfair trade and promoting demand for fairly traded commodities. Activism and ethical consumption not only promote fair trade but also act against powerful corporations such as [[Mars, Incorporated]] that refuse to acknowledge the use of forced child labor in the harvesting of their cocoa.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

==== Sustainability ====
Smallholding farmers not only frequently lack access to markets, they lack access to resources that lead to sustainable cocoa farming practices. Lack of sustainability can be due to pests, diseases that attack cocoa trees, lack of farming supplies, and lack of knowledge about modern farming techniques.&lt;ref name="Houston, Holly 2012" /&gt; One issue pertaining to cocoa plantation sustainability is the amount of time it takes for a cocoa tree to produce pods. A solution to this is to change the type of cocoa tree being farmed. In Ghana, a hybrid cocoa tree yields two crops after three years rather than the typical one crop after five years.

==== Harkin-Engel Protocol ====
The [[Harkin-Engel Protocol]], also commonly known as the Cocoa Protocol, is an international agreement that was created to end some of the world's worst forms of child labor, as well as forced labor in the cocoa industry. It was first negotiated by Senator Tom Harkin and Representative Eliot Engel after watching a documentary that showed the cocoa industry's widespread issue of child slavery and trafficking. The parties involved agreed to a six-article plan:

# Public statement of the need for and terms of an action plan—The cocoa industry acknowledged the problem of forced child labor and will commit "significant resources" to address the problem.
# Formation of multi-sectoral advisory groups—By 1 October 2001, an advisory group will be formed to research labor practices. By 1 December 2001, industry will form an advisory group and formulate appropriate remedies to address the worst forms of child labor.
# Signed joint statement on child labor to be witnessed at the ILO—By 1 December 2001, a statement must be made recognizing the need to end the worst forms of child labor and identify developmental alternatives for the children removed from labor.

=== Textiles ===
Fair trade [[textile]]s are primarily made from fair trade cotton. By 2015, almost 75,000 cotton farmers in developing countries have obtained Fairtrade certification. The minimum price that Fair trade pays allows cotton farmers to sustain and improve their livelihoods.&lt;ref name="Farmers' self-determination"&gt;Singh Anup Kumar. in E+Z / D+C [http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/fairtrade-improving-cotton-farmers-lot-africa-and-india] February, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Fair trade textiles are frequently grouped with fair trade crafts and goods made by artisans in contrast to cocoa, coffee, sugar, tea, and honey, which are agricultural commodities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==== Locations ====
India, Pakistan and West Africa are the primary exporters of fair trade cotton, although many countries grow fair trade cotton.&lt;ref name="Bassett, Thomas J 2010"&gt;Bassett, Thomas J. "Slim pickings: Fairtrade cotton in West Africa." Geoforum, 2010. 41(1): 44-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Littrell, M. A. 1998"&gt;Littrell, M. A., and M. A. Dickson. "Fair Trade Performance in a Competitive Market." Clothing and Textiles Research Journal 16.4 (1998): 176-89&lt;/ref&gt; Textiles and clothing are exported from Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==== Labour ====
Labour is different for textile production than for agricultural commodities because textile production takes place in a factory, not on a farm. Children provide a source of cheap labor, and [[child labor]] is prevalent in Pakistan, India, and Nepal. Fair trade cooperatives ensure fair and safe labor practices, including disallowing child labor.&lt;ref name="Grimes, Kimberly M. 2000"&gt;Grimes, Kimberly M., and B. Lynne Milgram. Artisans and Cooperatives: Developing Alternative Trade for the Global Economy. Tucson: University of Arizona, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Fair trade textile producers are most often women in developing countries. They struggle with meeting the consumer tastes in North America and Europe. In Nepal, textiles were originally made for household and local use. In the 1990s, women began joining cooperatives and exporting their crafts for profit. Now handicrafts are Nepal's largest export. It is often difficult for women to balance textile production, domestic responsibilities, and agricultural work. Cooperatives foster the growth of democratic communities in which women have a voice despite being historically in underprivileged positions.&lt;ref name="Grimes, Kimberly M. 2000" /&gt; For fair trade textiles and other crafts to be successful in western markets, [[World Fair Trade Organization]]s require a flexible workforce of artisans in need of stable income, links from consumers to artisans, and a market for quality ethnic products.&lt;ref name="Littrell, M. A. 1998" /&gt;

However, making cotton and textiles fair trade does not always benefit laborers. Burkina Faso and Mali export the largest amount of cotton in Africa. Although many cotton plantations in these countries attained fair trade certification in the 1990s, participation in fair trade further ingrains existing power relations and inequalities that cause poverty in Africa rather than challenging them. Fair trade does not do much for farmers when it does not challenge the system that marginalizes producers. Despite not empowering farmers, the change to fair trade cotton has positive effects including female participation in cultivation.&lt;ref name="Bassett, Thomas J 2010" /&gt;

Textiles and garments are intricate and require one individual operator, in contrast to the collective farming of coffee and cocoa beans. Textiles are not a straightforward commodity because to be fairly traded, there must be regulation in cotton cultivation, dyeing, stitching, and every other step in the process of textile production.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Fair trade textiles must not be confused with the sweat-free movement although the two movements intersect at the worker level.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Forced or unfair labor in textile production is not limited to developing countries. Charges of use of [[sweatshop]] labor are endemic in the United States. Immigrant women work long hours and receive less than minimum wage. In the United States, there is more of a stigma against child labor than forced labor in general. Consumers in the United States are willing to suspend the importation of textiles made with child labor in other countries but do not expect their exports to be suspended by other countries, even when produced using [[forced labor]].&lt;ref&gt;Bhagwati, Jagdish.

=== Seafood ===
With increasing media scrutiny of the conditions of fishermen, particularly Southeast Asia, the lack of transparency and traceability in the [[seafood]] industry prompted new efforts. In 2014, [[Fair Trade USA]] created its Capture Fisheries Program that led to the first instance of Fair Trade fish being sold globally in 2015. The program "requires fishermen to source and trade according to standards that protect fundamental human rights, prevent forced and child labor, establish safe working conditions, regulate work hours and benefits, and enable responsible resource management." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Responsibility in the Global Seafood Industry|url=https://www.fishwise.org/images/white_papers/Social_Responsibility_in_the_Global_Seafood_Industry.pdf|website=FishWise|publisher=FishWise|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Large companies and commodities ===
Large transnational companies have begun to use fair trade commodities in their products. In April 2000, [[Starbucks]] began offering fair trade coffee in all of their stores. In 2005, the company promised to purchase ten million pounds of fair trade coffee over the next 18 months. This would account for a quarter of the fair trade coffee purchases in the United States and 3% of Starbucks' total coffee purchases.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; The company maintains that increasing its fair trade purchases would require an unprofitable reconstruction of the supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Macdonald | first1 = Kate | year = 2007 | title = Globalising Justice within Coffee Supply Chains? Fair Trade, Starbucks and the Transformation of Supply Chain Governance | url = | journal = Third World Quarterly | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 793–812 | doi=10.1080/01436590701336663}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fair trade activists have made gains with other companies: [[Sara Lee Corporation]] in 2002 and [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (the maker of [[Folgers]]) in 2003 agreed to begin selling a small amount of fair trade coffee. [[Nestlé]], the world's biggest coffee trader, began selling a blend of fair trade coffee in 2005.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; In 2006, [[The Hershey Company]] acquired [[Dagoba Chocolate|Dagoba]], an organic and fair trade chocolate brand.

Much contention surrounds the issue of fair trade products becoming a part of large companies. Starbucks is still only 3% fair trade – enough to appease consumers, but not enough to make a real difference to small farmers, according to some activists. The ethics of buying fair trade from a company that is not committed to the cause are questionable; these products are only making a small dent in a big company even though these companies' products account for a significant portion of global fair trade.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

=== Luxury commodities ===

There have been efforts to introduce fair trade practices to the [[luxury goods]] industry, particularly for gold and diamonds.

==== Diamonds and sourcing ====

In parallel to efforts to commoditize diamonds, some industry players have launched campaigns to introduce benefits to mining centers in the developing world. Rapaport Fair Trade was established with the goal "to provide ethical education for jewelry suppliers, buyers, first time or seasoned diamond buyers, social activists, students, and anyone interested in jewelry, trends, and ethical luxury."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rapaportfairtrade.com/What-is-RapFT/About.aspx |title=About Us |publisher=Rapaport Fair Trade |accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's founder, [[Martin Rapaport]], as well as [[Kimberley Process]] initiators Ian Smillie and [[Global Witness]], are among several industry insiders and observers who have called for greater checks and certification programs among many other programs that would ensure protection for miners and producers in developing countries. Smillie and Global Witness have since withdrawn support for the Kimberley Process. Other concerns in the diamond industry include working conditions in diamond cutting centers as well as the use of child labor. Both of these concerns come up when considering issues in Surat, India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/01/02/rough_cut Rough Cut] Foreign Policy, 2 Jan 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gold ====
Brilliant Earth has committed itself to using fair-trade-certified gold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/style/article/Couple-s-ringing-endorsement-of-ethical-jewelry-3217614.php Couple's ringing endorsement of ethical jewelry] SFGate&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, the United Kingdom's Fairtrade Foundation became the first NGO to begin certifying gold under the fair trade rubric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shapingsustainablemarkets.iied.org/fairtrade-gold |title=Fairtrade Gold &amp;#124; Shaping Sustainable Markets |publisher=Shapingsustainablemarkets.iied.org |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pornography or Sex industry ===
The concept of fair trade also influence the [[porn]] industry. Feminist columnists in several publication have written articles toward a pornography industry with mutual consent and no exploiting labor condition to actors and actresses. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/life/ethical-porn-474913&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dailydot.com/irl/ethical-porn/&lt;/ref&gt; There are also academic discourse about these facets. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1080/23268743.2014.888251|title = Fair-trade porn + niche markets + feminist audience|journal = Porn Studies|volume = 1|pages = 189–192|year = 2014|last1 = Mondin|first1 = Alessandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1177/0966735010384332|title = Fair Trade Sex: Reflections on God, Sex, and Economics|journal = Feminist Theology|volume = 19|issue = 2|pages = 194–207|year = 2010|last1 = Cooper|first1 = Thia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===
[[File:Faitrade display.jpg|thumb|Display of Fairtrade products at the [[Derbyshire County Council]] head office]]
In 1994, the [[European Commission]] prepared the "Memo on alternative trade" in which it declared its support for strengthening Fair Trade in the South and North and its intention to establish an EC Working Group on Fair Trade. Furthermore, the same year, the [[European Parliament]] adopted the "Resolution on promoting fairness and solidarity in North South trade" (OJ C 44, 14 February 1994), a resolution voicing its support for fair trade. In 1996, the [[Economic and Social Committee]] adopted an "Opinion on the European 'Fair Trade' marking movement". A year later, in 1997, the document was followed by a resolution adopted by the European Parliament, calling on the [[European Commission]] to support Fair Trade banana operators. The same year, the European Commission published a survey on "Attitudes of EU consumers to Fair Trade bananas", concluding that Fair Trade bananas would be commercially viable in several EU Member States.&lt;ref name="FINE2006"&gt;FINE (2006). Business Unusual. Brussels: Fair Trade Advocacy Office&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the European Parliament adopted the "Resolution on Fair Trade" (OJ C 226/73, 20 July 1998), which was followed by the Commission in 1999 that adopted the "Communication from the Commission to the Council on 'Fair Trade'" COM(1999) 619 final, 29 November 1999. In 2000, public institutions in Europe started purchasing Fairtrade Certified coffee and tea. Furthermore, that year, the [[Cotonou Agreement]] made specific reference to the promotion of Fair Trade in article 23(g) and in the Compendium. The [[European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/36/EC]] also suggested promoting Fair Trade.&lt;ref name="FINE2006" /&gt; In 2001 and 2002, several other EU papers explicitly mentioned fair trade, most notably the 2001 Green Paper on [[Corporate Social Responsibility]] and the 2002 Communication on Trade and Development.

In 2004, the [[European Union]] adopted the "Agricultural Commodity Chains, Dependence and Poverty – A proposal for an EU Action Plan", with a specific reference to the Fair Trade movement which has "been setting the trend for a more socio-economically responsible trade." (COM(2004)0089). In 2005, in the European Commission communication "Policy Coherence for Development – Accelerating progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals", (COM(2005) 134 final, 12 April 2005), fair trade is mentioned as "a tool for poverty reduction and sustainable development".&lt;ref name="FINE2006" /&gt;

On July 6, 2006, the European Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution on fair trade, recognizing the benefits achieved by the Fair Trade movement, suggesting the development of an EU-wide policy on Fair Trade, defining criteria that need to be fulfilled under fair trade to protect it from abuse and calling for greater support to Fair Trade (EP resolution "Fair Trade and development", 6 July 2006). "This resolution responds to the impressive growth of Fair Trade, showing the increasing interest of European consumers in responsible purchasing," said [[European Green Party|Green]] MEP [[Frithjof Schmidt]] during the plenary debate. [[Peter Mandelson]], EU Commissioner for External Trade, responded that the resolution will be well received at the [[European Commission]]. "Fair Trade makes the consumers think and therefore it is even more valuable. We need to develop a coherent policy framework and this resolution will help us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade-advocacy.org/ftao-publications/press-releases/press-release-2006/157-european-parliament-supports-fair-trade|title=European Parliament supports Fair Trade|website=www.fairtrade-advocacy.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
In 2005, French [[French National Assembly|parliament]] member [[Antoine Herth]] issued the report "40 proposals to sustain the development of Fair Trade". The report was followed the same year by a law, proposing to establish a commission to recognize fair trade Organisations (article 60 of law no. 2005-882, Small and Medium Enterprises, 2 August 2005).&lt;ref name="FINE2006" /&gt; In parallel to the legislativents, also in 2006, the French chapter of [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] (AFNOR) adopted a reference document on Fair Trade after five years of discussion.

=== Italy ===
In 2006, Italian lawmakers started debating how to introduce a law on fair trade in [[Parliament of Italy|Parliament]]. A consultation process involving a wide range of stakeholders was launched in early October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vita.it/articolo/index.php3?NEWSID=72176 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312214105/http://www.vita.it/articolo/index.php3?NEWSID=72176 |archivedate=2007-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common definition of fair trade was most notably developed. However, its adoption is still pending as the efforts were stalled by the [[2008 Italian political crisis]].

=== Netherlands ===
The Dutch province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] was sued in 2007 by coffee supplier [[Douwe Egberts]] for explicitly requiring its coffee suppliers to meet fair trade criteria, most notably the payment of a minimum price and a development premium to producer cooperatives. Douwe Egberts, which sells a number of coffee brands under self-developed ethical criteria, believed the requirements were discriminatory. After several months of discussions and legal challenges, the province of Groningen prevailed in a well-publicized judgement. Coen de Ruiter, director of the Max Havelaar Foundation, called the victory a landmark event: "it provides governmental institutions the freedom in their purchasing policy to require suppliers to provide coffee that bears the fair trade criteria, so that a substantial and meaningful contribution is made in the fight against poverty through the daily cup of coffee".&lt;ref&gt;Max Havelaar Foundation (2007). [85.82.218.199/fileadmin/Bruger_filer/Dokument_database/IKAvaerktoej/EU_siden/Max_Havalaar.pdf Dutch Province of Groningen wins summary brought by Doug Egberts and can continue specifying fair trade coffee]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{Main article|Fair trade debate}}
{{Criticism section|date=February 2013}}
While there have been studies claiming fair trade as beneficial and efficient,&lt;ref name="Bacon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bacon|first=Christopher|title=Confronting the Coffee Crisis: Can Fair Trade, Organic, and Specialty Coffees Reduce Small-Scale Farmer Vulnerability in Northern Nicaragua?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X04002062|accessdate=31 December 2012|doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2004.10.002|volume=33|issue=3|journal=World Development|pages=497–511|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; other studies have been less favourable; showing limitations to fair trade benefits. Sometimes the criticism is intrinsic to fair trade, sometimes efficiency depends on the broader context such as the lack of government help or volatile prices in the global market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Utting-chamorro|first=Karla|title=Does fair trade make a difference?

=== Ethical basis===
Studies have shown a significant number of consumers were content to pay higher prices for fair trade products, in the belief that this helps the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchising.com/news/20080612_costa_coffee_hosts_national_foundation_day_to_enco.html |title=Costa Coffee Hosts National 'Foundation Day' To Encourage Ethical Coffee Consumption |publisher=Franchising.com |date=2008-06-12 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Niemi|first= N. |year=2010|title=Empowering Coffee Traders?

Furthermore, research has cited the implementation of certain Fairtrade standards as a cause for greater inequalities in markets where these rigid rules are inappropriate for the specific market.&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections" /&gt;{{Self-published source|date=March 2015}}&lt;ref name="Booth, P 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doppler, F. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Philip "Don't bully the faithful into buying Fairtrade", The Catholic Herald, 20 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perso2010"/&gt;

=== What occurs with the money? ===

==== Little money may reach the developing countries ====
The Fairtrade Foundation does not monitor how much extra retailers charge for fair trade goods, so it is rarely possible to determine how much extra is charged or how much reaches the producers, in spite of l unfair trading legislation. In four cases it has been possible to find out. One British café chain was passing on less than one percent of the extra charged to the exporting cooperative;&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections" /&gt; in Finland, Valkila, Haaparanta and Niemi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Valkila | first1 = J. | last2 = Haaparanta | first2 = P. | last3 = Niemi | first3 = N. | year = 2010 | title = Empowering Coffee Traders?

==== Less money reaches farmers ====
The Fairtrade Foundation does not monitor how much of the extra money paid to the exporting cooperatives reaches the farmer. The cooperatives incur costs in reaching fair trade political standards, and these are incurred on all production, even if only a small amount is sold at fair trade prices. The most successful cooperatives appear to spend a third of the extra price received on this: some less successful cooperatives spend more than they gain. While this appears to be agreed by proponents and critics of fair trade,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Utting-Chamorro, K (2005). Does Fairtrade make a difference? The case of small coffee producers in Nicaragua. Development in Practice, Volume 15, Numbers 3 and 4, June 2005, Berndt, C.E. (2007). Is Fair Trade in coffee production fair and useful? Evidence from Costa Rica and Guatemala and implications for policy. Washington DC.: Mercatus 65 Policy Series, Policy Comment 11, Mercatus Centre, George Mason University.&lt;/ref&gt; there is a dearth of economic studies setting out the actual revenues and what the money was spent on. FLO figures&lt;ref name="Labelling"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International |title=Annual Report 2009–2010 |year= 2010 |accessdate=May 27, 2011 |url= http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/resources/FLO_Annual-Report-2009_komplett_double_web.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; are that 40% of the money reaching the [[developing world]] is spent on 'business and production' which would include these costs, as well as costs incurred by any inefficiency and corruption in the cooperative or the marketing system. The rest is stated to be spent on social projects, rather than being passed on to farmers.

Anecdotes state that farmers were paid more or less by traders than by fair trade cooperatives. Few of these anecdotes address the problems of price reporting in developing world markets,&lt;ref&gt;See Bowbrick, P, "Are price reporting systems of any use?", British Food Journal. 90(2) 65–69 March/April. 1988. Current international research on developing world market information systems is given at [http://www.sim2g.org/ sim2.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and few appreciate the complexity of the different price packages which may or may not include credit, harvesting, transport, processing, etc. Cooperatives typically average prices over the year, so they pay less than traders at some times, more at others. Bassett (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Bassett, T. (2009). Slim pickings: Fairtrade cotton in West Africa. Geoforum.&lt;/ref&gt; is able to compare prices only where Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade farmers have to sell cotton to the same monopsonistic ginneries which pay low prices. Prices would have to be higher to compensate farmers for the increased costs they incur to produce fair trade. For instance, fair trade encouraged Nicaraguan farmers to switch to organic coffee, which resulted in a higher price per pound, but a lower net income because of higher costs and lower yields.&lt;ref&gt;Kilian, B., Jones, C., Pratt, L., &amp; Villalobos, A. (2006). "Is Sustainable Agriculture a Viable Strategy to Improve Farm Income in Central America? A Case Study on Coffee". ''Journal of Business Research'' 59(3), 322–330.; Valkila, J. (2009). Fair Trade organic coffee production in Nicaragua – Sustainable development or a poverty trap? ''Ecological Economics'' 68 3018–25; Wilson, B. R. (2009). Indebted to Fair Trade? Coffee and Crisis in Nicaragua. Geoforum.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effects of low barriers to entry ====
A 2015 study concluded that the low barriers to entry in a competitive market such as coffee undermines any effort to give higher benefits to producers through fair trade. They used data from Central America, to establish that the producer benefits were close to zero. This is because there is an oversupply of certification, and only a fraction of produce classified as fair trade is actually sold on fair trade markets, just enough to recoup the costs of certification.&lt;ref name="mitpressjournals.org"/&gt;

=== Inefficient marketing system ===
One reason for high prices is that fair trade farmers have to sell through a [[monopsonist]] cooperative, which may be inefficient or corrupt – certainly some private traders are more efficient than some cooperatives. They cannot choose the buyer who offers the best price, or switch when their cooperative is going bankrupt&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, R., &amp; J. Bastiaensen, J. (2003). Fair Trade and the Coffee Crisis in the Nicaraguan Segovias. Small Enterprise Development, 14(2), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; if they wish to retain fairtrade status. There are also complaints that Fairtrade deviates from the free market ideal of some economists. [[Brink Lindsey]] calls fair trade a "misguided attempt to make up for market failures" encouraging market inefficiencies and overproduction.&lt;ref name="Brink"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamsmith.org/pdf/groundsforcomplaint.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517134810/http://www.adamsmith.org/pdf/groundsforcomplaint.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fair trade harms other farmers ===

==== Overproduction argument ====
Critics argue that fair trade harms all non-Fairtrade farmers. Fair trade claims that its farmers are paid higher prices and are given special advice on increasing yields and quality. Economists&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections" /&gt;{{Self-published source|date=March 2015}}&lt;ref name="Brink" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, P. and L. Whetstone (2007) 'Half a Cheer for Fair Trade', Economic Affairs, 27, 2, 29–36; Sidwell, M. (2008) Unfair Trade, London: Adam Smith Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harford, T: "The Undercover Economist.", 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Markets, poverty, and Fair Trade | author = Sam Bowman | date = 11 March 2011 | url = http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/tax-and-economy/markets,-poverty,-and-fair-trade/ | publisher = [[Adam Smith Institute]] | accessdate = 2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{ cite journal | journal = The Economist | date = Dec 7, 2006 | url = http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8380592 | title = Voting with your trolley }}&lt;/ref&gt; state that, if this is indeed so, Fairtrade farmers will increase production. As the demand for coffee is highly elastic, a small increase in supply means a large fall in market price, so perhaps a million Fairtrade farmers get a higher price and 24 million others get a substantially lower price. Critics quote the example of farmers in Vietnam being paid over the world price in the 1980s, planting lots of coffee, then flooding the world market in the 1990s. The fair trade minimum price means that when the world market price collapses, it is the non-fair trade farmers, particularly the poorest, who have to cut down their coffee trees. This argument is supported by mainstream economists, not just free marketers.{{refneeded|date=October 2017}}

=== Other ethical issues ===

==== Secrecy ====
Under EU law ([[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive|Directive 2005/29/EC]] on Unfair Commercial Practices) the criminal offence of Unfair Trading is committed if (a) 'it contains false information and is therefore untruthful or in any way, including overall presentation, deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer, even if the information is factually correct', (b) 'it omits material information that the average consumer needs ... and thereby causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise' or (c) 'fails to identify the commercial intent of the commercial practice ... [which] causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise.' [[Peter Griffiths (economist)| 	
Peter Griffiths]] (2011)&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections" /&gt; points to false claims that fair trade producers get higher prices, the almost universal failure to disclose the extra price charged for fair trade products, to disclose how much of this actually reaches the developing world, to disclose what this is spent on in the developing world, to disclose how much, if any, reaches farmers, and to disclose the harm that Fairtrade does to non-fair trade farmers. He also points to the failure to disclose when 'the primary commercial intent' is to make money for retailers and distributors in rich countries.

==== Unethical selling techniques ====
[[Philip Booth (economist)|Philip Booth]] says that the selling techniques used by some sellers and some supporters of fair trade are bullying, misleading, and unethical.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org.uk/record.jsp?type=book&amp;ID=437&lt;/ref&gt; There are problems with the use of boycott campaigns and other pressure to force sellers to stock a product they think ethically suspect. However, the opposite has been argued, that a more participatory and multi-stakeholder approach to auditing might improve the quality of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntd.co.uk/idsbookshop/details.asp?id=807 |title=IDS Bookshop – Item details |publisher=Ntd.co.uk |accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people argue that these practices are justifiable: that strategic use of labeling may help embarrass (or encourage) major suppliers into changing their practices. They may make transparent corporate vulnerabilities that activists can exploit. Or they may encourage ordinary people to get involved with broader projects of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Julie Guthman | year = 2007 | journal = Antipode | title = The Polanyian Way? Voluntary Food Labels as Neoliberal Governance | volume = 39 | pages = 456–78 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8330.2007.00535.x | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Failure to monitor standards ===
There are complaints that the standards are inappropriate and may harm producers, sometimes making them work several months more for little return.&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections" /&gt;{{Self-published source|date=March 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Utting-Chamorro | first1 = K | year = 2005 | title = Does Fairtrade make a difference? The case of small coffee producers in Nicaragua | url = | journal = Development in Practice | volume = 15 | issue = 3, 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moberg M (2005). "Fairtrade and Eastern Caribbean Banana Farmers: Rhetoric and Reality in the Anti-Globalization Movement." Human Organization 64:4–16, Cited in Nelson and Pound (2009) p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="valkila2009" /&gt;

Adherence to fair trade standards by producers has been poor, and enforcement of standards by Fairtrade is weak. Notably by Christian Jacquiau&lt;ref name="Hamel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Fair_trade_firm_accused_of_foul_play.html?cid=5351232 |title=Fair trade firm accused of foul play I |publisher=Swissinfo.ch |date=2006-08-03 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Paola Ghillani, who spent four years as president of Fairtrade Labelling Organizations&lt;ref name="Hamel" /&gt; There are many complaints of poor enforcement problems: labourers on Fairtrade farms in Peru are paid less than the minimum wage;&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, H. (2006, August 9). 'Fair' coffee workers paid below minimum wage. Financial Times; Weitzman, H. (2006, September 9). ''Ethical-coffee' workers paid below legal minimum. Financial Times.&lt;/ref&gt; some non-Fairtrade coffee is sold as Fairtrade&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, H.: 2006, The bitter cost of 'Fair Trade' coffee. Financial Times, September 8.&lt;/ref&gt; 'the standards are not very strict in the case of seasonally hired labour in coffee production.'&lt;ref name="valkila2009" /&gt; 'some fair trade standards are not strictly enforced'&lt;ref name="Reed" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, G., Gibbon, J., &amp; Slack, R.: 2006, 'The mainstreaming of Fair Trade: a macromarketing perspective', Journal of Strategic Marketing, 14, 329–52.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a ''[[Financial Times]]'' journalist found that ten out of ten mills visited had sold uncertified coffee to co-operatives as certified. It reported that "The FT was also handed evidence of at least one coffee association that received an organic, Fair Trade or other certifications despite illegally growing some 20 per cent of its coffee in protected national forest land.&lt;ref name="ft.com"&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d191adbc-3f4d-11db-a37c-0000779e2340.html | newspaper =FT | place = Americas | title = The bitter cost of 'fair trade' coffee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trade justice and fair trade ===
Segments of the [[trade justice]] movement have also criticized fair trade in the past years for allegedly focusing too much on individual small producer groups while stopping short of advocating immediate trade policy changes that would have a larger effect on disadvantaged producers' lives. French author and [[Radio France Internationale|RFI]] correspondent [[Jean-Pierre Boris]] championed this view in his 2005 book ''Commerce inéquitable''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Boris | first = Jean-Pierre | year = 2005 | title = Commerce inéquitable | publisher = Hachette Littératures | place = Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political objections ===
There have been largely political criticisms of fair trade from the left and the right. Some believe the fair trade system is not radical enough. French author Christian Jacquiau, in his book ''Les coulisses du commerce équitable'', calls for stricter fair trade standards and criticizes the fair trade movement for working within the current system (i.e., partnerships with mass retailers, [[multinational corporation]]s, etc.) rather than establishing a new fairer, fully autonomous (i.e. [[state monopoly|government monopoly]]) trading system. Jacquiau also supports significantly higher fair trade prices in order to maximize the effect, as most producers only sell a portion of their crop under fair trade terms.{{Sfn | Jacquiau | 2006}}{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}} It has been argued that the approach of the FairTrade system is too rooted in a Northern consumerist view of justice which Southern producers do not participate in setting. "A key issue is therefore to make explicit who possesses the power to define the terms of Fairtrade, that is who possesses the power to determine the need of an ethic in the first instance, and subsequently command a particular ethical vision as the truth."&lt;ref&gt;Catherine S. Dolan (2008), ''Research in Economic Anthropology'', "Arbitrating risk through moral values: the case of Kenyan fairtrade", volume 28, pp. 271–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9936">'''Geometrical-optical illusions''' are [[visual illusions]], also [[optical illusions]], in which the geometrical properties of what is seen differ from those of the corresponding objects in the visual field.

==Geometrical properties==
In studying geometry one concentrates on the position of points and on the length, orientation and curvature of lines.  Geometrical-optical illusions then relate in the first instance to object characteristics as defined by geometry. Though vision is three-dimensional, in many situations depth can be factored out and attention concentrated on a simple view of a two-dimensional tablet with its x and y co-ordinates. '

==Illusions are in visual space==
Whereas their counterparts in the observer's object space are public and have measurable properties, the illusions themselves are private to the observer's (human or animal) experience.  Nevertheless, they are accessible to portrayal by verbal and other communication and even to measurement by [[psychophysics]]. A nulling technique is particularly useful in which a target is deliberately given an opposing deformation in an effort to cancel the illusion.

== Categories of visual illusions ==

[[Image:Mach band.svg|thumb|left|120px|Mach bands = visual illusion of brightness (intensive property)]] [[Image:PoggZoelMuel.png|thumb|120px|right|Illusions of position (Poggendorff), orientation (Zöllner) and, below, length (Müller-Lyer)]] 
[[Image:Heringill.png|thumb|right|120px|Hering Illusion of curvature]] 
[[Image:Delboeufill.png|thumb|left|120px|Delboeuf Illusion of size: left inner circle and right outer circle are actually equal]] 
[[Image:HorVert.png|thumb|right|120px|Vertical-horizontal Illusion]] 
[[Image:Shifted chessboard.svg|thumb|left|120px|Shifted chessboard illusion]]

Visual or Optical Illusions can be categorized according to the nature of the difference between objects and percepts. For example, these can be in brightness or color, called ''intensive'' properties of targets, e.g. [[Mach bands]]. Or they can be in their location, size, orientation or depth, called ''extensive''.  When an illusion involves properties that fall within the purview of geometry it is ''geometrical-optical'', a term given to it in the first scientific paper devoted to the topic by J.J. Oppel, a German high-school teacher, in 1854.  It was taken up by [[Wilhelm Wundt]], widely regarded as the founder of experimental psychology, and is now universally used.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, J.O. (1998) ''The Psychology of Visual Illusion''. Dover, Mineola, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coren, S. and Girgus, J.S. (1978) ''Seeing is Deceiving: The Psychology of Visual Illusions''. Erlbaum, Hillsdale, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wade, N. (1982) ''The Art and Science of Visual Illusions''. Routledge, London&lt;/ref&gt; That by 1972 the first edition of Robinson's book devotes 100 closely printed pages and over 180 figures to these illusions attests to their popularity.

==Examples of geometrical-optical Illusions==
The easiest to explore are the geometrical-optical illusions that show up in ordinary black and white line drawings. A few examples are drawn from the list of optical illusions. They illustrate illusions of position ([[Poggendorff illusion]]), of length ([[Müller-Lyer illusion]]), of orientation  ([[Zöllner illusion]],  [[Münsterberg illusion]] or shifted-chess-board illusion and its [[café wall illusion]] variant), of rectilinearity or straightness of lines ([[Hering illusion]]), of size ([[Delboeuf illusion]])  and of vertical/horizontal anisotropy ([[Vertical-horizontal illusion]]), in which the vertical extension appears exaggerated.

==Related phenomena==
[[Image:Necker cube.svg|thumb|right|120px|Necker cube = reversible figure]] [[Image:Penrose triangle.svg|thumb|120px|left|Penrose triangle = unrealizable object]] [[Image:Kanizsa triangle.svg|thumb|120px|left|Kanizsa triangle = illusory contours]]  Visual illusions proper should be distinguished from some related phenomena.  Some simple targets such as the [[Necker Cube]] are capable of more than one interpretation, which are usually seen in alternation, one at a time. They may be called ambiguous configurations rather than illusion, because what is seen at any time is not actually illusory.  The configurations of the [[Roger Penrose|Penrose]] or [[M. C. Escher|Escher]] type are illusory in the sense that only on a detailed logical analysis it becomes apparent that they are not physically realizable. If one thinks of an ''illusion'' as something out there that is misinterpreted, and of a ''delusion'' when a demonstrable substrate is lacking, the distinction breaks down for such effects as the [[Kanizsa triangle]]  and ''[[illusory contours]].''

==Explanations ==
Explanations of geometrical-optical illusion are based on one of two modes of attack: 
* the ''physiological'' or ''bottom-up,'' seeking the cause of the deformation in the eye's optical imaging or in signal misrouting during neural processing in the retina or the first stages of the brain, the primary visual cortex, or
* the ''cognitive'' or ''perceptual'', which regards the deviation from true size, shape or position as caused by the assignment of a percept to a meaningful but false or inappropriate object class.

The first stage in the operations that transfer information from a visual target in front of an observer into its neural representation in the brain and then allow a percept to emerge, is the imaging by the eye and the processing by the neural circuits in the retina.  Some components of geometrical-optical illusions can be ascribed to aberrations at that level.  Even if this does not fully account for an illusion, the step is helpful because it puts elaborate mental theories in a more secure place. The [[moon illusion]] is a good example.  Before invoking concepts of apparent distance and [[size constancy]], it helps to be sure that the retinal image hasn't changed much when the moon looks larger as it descends to the horizon. 
   
Once the signals from the retina enter the visual cortex, a host of local interactions are known to take place.  In particular, neurons are tuned to target orientation and their response are known to depend on context.  The widely accepted interpretation of, e.g. the Poggendorff and Hering illusions as manifestation of expansion of acute angles at line intersections, is an example of successful implementation of a "bottom-up," physiological explanation of a geometrical-optical illusion.

[[Image:PonzoType.png|thumb|left|120px|Ponzo illusion in a purely schematic form and, below, with perspective clues]] However, almost all geometrical optical illusions have components that are at present not amenable to physiological explanations.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, R.L. 1997 ''Eye and Brain''. Princeton University Press: Princeton N.J.&lt;/ref&gt;  The subject, therefore, is a fertile field for propositions based in the disciplines of perception and cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Howe CQ, Purves D (2005) ''Perceiving geometry : geometrical illusions explained by natural scene statistics''  Springer : New York&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate: Instead of interpreting them as just a pair the sloping lines within which one feature is seen smaller than an identical one nearer to the point of convergence, the Ponzo pattern may be taken for a railroad track rendered as a [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] drawing. A barrel lying within the rails would have to be physically wider to cover the increased portion of the width of the track if it were farther away.  The consequence is the judgment that the barrels differ in diameter, whereas their physical size in the drawing is equal.

A scientific study will include the recognition that a representation of the visual word is embodied in the state of the organism's nervous system at the time the illusion is experienced. In the discipline of experimental neuroscience, a top-down influence has the meaning that signals originating in higher neural centers, repository of memory traces, innate patterns and decision operations, travel down to lower neuronal circuits where they cause a shift of the excitation balance in the deviated direction.  Such a concept is to be distinguished from the bottom-up approach which would look for aberrations that are imposed on the input in its path through the sensory apparatus. Top-down neural signaling would be a fitting implementation of the [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]] concept enunciated by [[Max Wertheimer]] &lt;ref&gt;Wertheimer, M. (1938) in W.D. Ellis (Ed) ''A Source Book of Gestalt Psychology''. Harcourt Brace : New York&lt;/ref&gt; that the "properties of any of the parts are determined by the intrinsic structural laws of the whole."

==Mathematical transformation==
When objects and associated percepts, in their respective spaces, correspond to each other albeit with deformations describable in terms of geometry, the mathematically inclined are tempted to search for transformations, perhaps non-Euclidean,&lt;ref&gt;Luneburg, R.K. (1947) ''Mathematical Analysis of Binocular Vision''. Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt; that map them on each other. Application of differential geometry has so far not been notably successful [https://bspace.berkeley.edu/access/content/user/54855/Spatrans.pdf]; the variety and complexity of the phenomena, significant differences between individuals and dependence on context, previous experience and instruction set a high bar for satisfying formulations.&lt;ref&gt;Westheimer, G. (2008) "Geometrical-optical illusions and the neural representation of space". ''Vision Res'', 48, 2128-2142&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Getting lost''' is the occurrence of a person or animal losing spatial reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Paul A.

==Process==
[[File:Maze.JPG|{{largethumb}}|In a [[maze]] one can get lost on a voluntary basis]]
[[Psychology]] and [[neuroscience]] help to understand the underlying processes which take place before, during and after getting lost. Getting lost is an aspect of [[behavioral geography]], in which human [[wayfinding]] and cognitive and environmental factors play a role. For successful travel, it is necessary to be able to identify origin and destination, to determine turn angles, to identify segment lengths and directions of movement, to recognize on route and distant landmarks. This information is required to plot a course designed to reach a destination (previously known or unknown) or to return to a home base after wandering. If a destination is known but is not directly connected by a path, road, or track to the origin, successful travel may involve search and exploration, spatial updating of one's location, finding familiar landmarks, recognition of segment length and sequencing, identification of a frame of reference. Human movement is often guided by external aids (cartographic maps, charts, compasses, pedometers, and the like).&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Reginald G. Golledge}}, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=TjzxpAWiamUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=cognitive+processes+and+geography&amp;ots=T8W1z316N9&amp;sig=PZ71cLoy1udZjvK4fsLMP76YRzw#v=onepage&amp;q=cognitive%20processes%20and%20geography&amp;f=false ''Wayfinding Behavior: Cognitive Mapping and Other Spatial Processes''] (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Getting lost is particularly problematic for children (who have not yet developed tools and strategies for maintaining their bearings) and for the [[elderly]], particularly those experiencing the onset of [[dementia]].&lt;ref name="Rudd"&gt;Betty Rudd, ''Introducing Psychopathology'' (2013), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Such individuals "can get lost while trying to find their local shop – due to their diminishing memory they can forget where the shop is, or where they live and why they went out of their house in the first place".&lt;ref name="Rudd"/&gt; People experiencing dementia also get lost more easily in poor visibility conditions because the mind fails to appropriately fill in cues as to missing landmarks.&lt;ref name="Rudd"/&gt; Getting lost in unfamiliar terrain can lead even an adult with a healthy mind to [[panic]] and engage in unthinking behaviors that make the situation even worse.&lt;ref name="Huth"&gt;John Edward Huth, ''The Lost Art of Finding Our Way'' (2013), p. 30-38.&lt;/ref&gt; The tendency of the mind to seek patterns and familiar signs can contribute to this in two ways. First the lost person may mistake features of the terrain for markers that were seen before they became lost, creating a false sense of orientation that may lead the lost person to pursue routes that take them even further off course. Second, the lost person may mistake such features for markers that were seen ''after'' they became lost, creating a false sense that they have made a circle and returned to an earlier point of their effort to find their bearings.&lt;ref name="Huth"/&gt;

==Historical occasions==
There have been some historically notable instances of people getting lost and either being rescued or dying. [[George Shannon (explorer)|George Shannon]], the youngest adult member of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] got lost on two occasions after being separated from the expedition. On August 26, 1804, he was sent to retrieve two pack horses; he was separated from the party for sixteen days and nearly starved, as he went without food for twelve days except for some grapes and rabbits. At first he thought he was behind the expedition, so he sped up thinking he could catch up.  Then, getting hungry, he went downstream to look for a trading party he could stay with. Finally [[John Colter]] was sent to find him. The second time was on August 6, 1805, when the expedition was at the [[Three Forks, Gallatin County, Montana|Three Forks]]. Shannon was dispatched up a fork the party had named Wisdom (the middle fork was named Jefferson and the placid fork, Philanthropy). He rejoined the party after three days by backtracking to the forks and following the trail of the others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:Hs40SqVO0tIJ:www.heinzhistorycenter.org/secondary.aspx%3Fid%3D55%26contentID%3D494+lewis+and+clark+pittsburgh+1803&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiPP2H7MEk7K8VINv8XQ0R4_gfv-abmcUwhmM4BHIye7up3Cf2BQgWhGAepUQDGk_Y_ljhM57MzjJFozGtijoN-vkPszpY1JuKBVpAR-sf8hJZsukRAnxGNYO5cE4UcP6gDRqc3&amp;sig=AHIEtbSCubTHn2lUz2h2yZ9kTwIlt5lwxA "Chapter 4: Lewis and Clark".]  Heniz History Center exhibit.  Retrieved 2011-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Muir]] wrote in his journals of an occasion when a visiting artist named Billy Simms "went forth to sketch while I was among the glaciers, and got lost - was thirty-six hours without food".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Muir]], in William Frederic Badè, ''The Writings of John Muir'' (1923), Vol. 9, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; Mentally ailing Church of England mission priest [[Alexander Mackonochie]] died after getting lost on December 14, 1887, while walking in the [[Mamore Forest|Forest of Mamore]], near [[Loch Leven (Highlands)|Loch Leven]], Scotland: the circumstances were later commemorated in a poem by [[William McGonagall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGonagall|first=William|title=The Tragic Death of the Rev. A. H. Mackonochie|url=http://www.mcgonagall-online.org.uk/gems/the-tragic-death-of-the-rev-a-h-mackonochie}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, Soviet and Russian mathematician [[Alexey Chervonenkis]] got lost in [[Losiny Ostrov National Park]]; a later search operation found him dead near [[Mytishchi]], a suburb of Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kp.ru/daily/26285/3163696/|script-title=ru:Известный ученый Алексей Червоненкис погиб в Москве|publisher=kp.ru|date=23 September 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction==
People are sometimes depicted in fiction and literature as getting lost, with substantial consequences. For example, due to "the physical structure of [[Rome]], whose streets were notoriously labyrinthine", it has been observed that "getting lost in Rome was staple of travel narratives".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wrigley, ''Regarding Romantic Rome'' (2007), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of getting lost is also a commonly reported theme of [[dream]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Gislason, ''Neuroscience Notes'' (2015), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Howard Rachlin''' (born 1935) is an American psychologist and the founder of [[teleological behaviorism]]. He is Emeritus Research Professor of Psychology, Department of Psychology, State University of New York, Stony Brook ([[State University of New York|SUNY]], Stony Brook, New York 11794, USA.  His initial work was in the quantitative analysis of operant behavior in pigeons, on which he worked with [[William M. Baum]], developing ideas from [[Richard Herrnstein]]'s [[matching law]].  He subsequently became one of the founders of [[Behavioral Economics]].  His current research focuses on patterns of choice over time and how those patterns affect self-control (on which he worked with [[George Ainslie (psychologist)|George Ainslie]]), including cooperation over time. His interests in Behavioral Economics include: decision making, the [[prisoner's dilemma]], addiction, and  gambling. He was one of the first board members of the [[Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior]].

This article deals with the activities of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], an agency of the [[Federal government of the United States]], that violate [[human rights]].

==General principles==
In 2003, Patricia Derian, who served as Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights in the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|Carter Administration]] wrote, "Through these U.S. military and intelligence agencies the United States government is sending a dangerous and double message. If this continues, it will subvert our entire human rights policy."&lt;ref name="NSAEBB85"&gt;{{Citation | publisher = George Washington University National Security Archive

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In understanding the CIA's role in human rights, there are challenging problems of ethics. [[John R. Stockwell]], a CIA officer who left the Agency and became a public critic, said of the CIA field officers: "They do not meet the death squads on the streets where they are actually chopping up people or laying them down on the street and running trucks over their heads. The CIA people in San Salvador meet the police chiefs, and the people who run the death squads, and they do liaise with them, they meet them beside the swimming pool of the villas. And it is a sophisticated, civilized kind of relationship. And they talk about their children, who are going to school at UCLA or Harvard and other schools, and they do not talk about the horrors of what is being done. They pretend like it is not true."&lt;ref name="Stockwell"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Florencio Caballero, a former Honduran Army interrogator, said that he had been trained by the Central Intelligence Agency, which the ''New York Times'' confirmed with US and Honduran officials. Much of his account was confirmed by three American and two Honduran officials, and may be the fullest given of how army and police units were authorized to organize death squads that seized, interrogated and killed suspected leftists. He said that while Argentine and Chilean trainers taught the Honduran Army kidnapping and elimination techniques, the CIA explicitly forbade the use of physical torture or assassination.&lt;ref name="Lemoyne1987-05-02"&gt;{{citation

 | journal=The New York Times
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caballero described the CIA role as ambiguous. "Caballero said his superior officers ordered him and other members of army intelligence units to conceal their participation in death squads from CIA advisers. He added that he was sent to Houston for six months in 1979 to be trained by CIA instructors in interrogation techniques. "They prepared me in interrogation to end the use of physical torture in Honduras - they taught psychological methods", Mr. Caballero said of his American training. "So when we had someone important, we hid him from the Americans, interrogated him ourselves and then gave him to a death squad to kill."

===Torture techniques===

There are balancing assertions that CIA personnel attempted to minimize abuses by foreign governments who practiced torture before any involvement with CIA.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} There is evidence that CIA has funded academic research, unwitting in some cases, which was then used to develop harsh interrogation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;

There has been considerable domestic and international protest against these practices. The [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|
United Nations' Special Rapporteur on Torture]], [[Human Rights Watch]], and American legal scholars have called for the prosecution of Bush administration officials who ordered torture, conspired to provide legal cover for torture, and CIA and DoD personnel and contract workers who carried it out.&lt;ref name="CallsforProsection"&gt;Calls for Prosecution

Torture and harsh imprisonment accusations (as well as documented examples)  were not limited to the recent War on Terror. [[Yuri Nosenko]], a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[KGB]] defector, was held in stark conditions of solitary confinement in a clandestine CIA facility in the continental US from 1966 to 1969.&lt;ref name="Bagley"&gt;{{citation

=====Waterboarding=====
{{Main|Waterboarding}}
Waterboarding is a method that gives the subject the sensation of drowning, and may cause permanent damage to the lungs and other parts of the body. Some individuals being waterboarded, who may have had preexisting cardiac or respiratory disease, died under the method.

For example, the CIA used [[waterboarding]], and other interrogation techniques against three suspected Al Quaeda members, [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], [[Abu Zubaydah]] and [[Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=CIA admit 'waterboarding' al-Qaida suspects |publisher=The Guardian newspaper (UK) |accessdate=2008-02-29 |date=2008-02-08 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/05/india.terrorism | location=London | first=Mark | last=Tran}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1322866 |title=CIA's Harsh Interrogation Techniques Described |publisher=ABC news (USA) |date=18 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Finding of War Crimes culpability=====
In 2007, [[Red Cross]] investigators concluded in a secret report that the Central Intelligence Agency's interrogation methods for high-level al Qaeda prisoners constituted torture which could make the Bush administration officials who approved them guilty of war crimes, according to the book ""Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals,"" by [[Jane Mayer]] a journalist for ''The New Yorker''.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;

According to the book, the report of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] found that the methods used on Abu Zubaydah, the first major al Qaeda figure captured by the United States, were "categorically" torture, which is illegal under both United States law and international conventions to which the U.S. is a party. A copy of the report was given to the CIA in 2007. For example, the book states that Abu Zubaydah was confined in a box "so small he said he had to double up his limbs in the fetal position" and was one of several prisoners to be "slammed against the walls," according to the Red Cross report.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;''New York Times'', 11 July 2008, "Book Cites Secret Red Cross Report of C.I.A. Torture of Qaeda Captives" https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/washington/11detain.html&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA has admitted that Abu Zubaydah and two other prisoners were waterboarded, a practice in which water is poured on the nose and mouth to create the sensation of suffocation and drowning.

====Training in torture====
{{further|U.S. Army and CIA interrogation manuals}}
On 24 January 1997, two CIA manuals were declassified in response to a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) request filed by the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' in 1994. The first manual, "[[KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation]]", dated July 1963, is the source of much of the material in the second manual. The second manual, "[[Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual - 1983]]", was used in at least seven U.S. training courses conducted in Latin American countries, including [[Honduras]], between 1982 and 1987. Both manuals deal exclusively with interrogation and have an entire chapter devoted to "coercive techniques."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Interrogation rooms should be windowless, soundproof, dark and without toilets. Suspects should be held incommunicado and should be deprived of any kind of normal routine in eating and sleeping. The manuals describe coercive techniques to be used "to induce psychological regression in the subject by bringing a superior outside force to bear on his will to resist."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

While the US manuals contained coercive measures, they did not rise to the level of what is generally defined as torture. Torture, however, has been culturally a part of authoritarian South American governments, especially in 1973-1983 ([[Dirty War]]). Argentina had learned such methods from the French in [[Operation Charly]] and its secret services trained the personnel of other South American countries. It is not clear to what extent field personnel and leadership of agencies of the Federal government of the United States (notably the CIA, Defense and State Departments, AID) were aware of this, condoned it, or actively assisted it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In 2007, the chief Argentinian interrogator, Ernesto Guillermo Barreiro, was arrested in the United States.&lt;ref name="NYT2007-04-05"&gt;{{Citation

The other two arrested were Peruvians, Telmo Ricardo Hurtado and Juan Manuel Rivera Rondon, accused of having participated in the massacre of 69 peasants in an Andean village in 1985, when President [[Alan García]] was trying to suppress the [[Maoist]] [[Shining Path]] guerrilla movement. Garcia was the President of Peru again from 2006 to 2011.

CIA involvement ranged from no knowledge, to knowledge but no participation, to knowledge with the suggestion that less brutal techniques were appropriate, to participation or observation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Rendition and disappearance===
[[Extraordinary rendition]] is the process of clandestinely moving a prisoner from where he was captured, to an interrogation center in a country not subject to US law regarding extreme methods of interrogation. Some reports indicate CIA personnel operated the prison and performed the interrogations, while others state that while the CIA delivered the prisoner, third-country intelligence personnel did the actual interrogation. The Wikipedia [[:Category:Black sites]] details the list of known or suspected [[Black Site|black sites]] where CIA prisoners may be detained. Known or suspected aircraft used to transport prisoners are in [[Rendition aircraft]].

A claim that the black sites existed was made by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in November 2005 and before by [[human rights]] [[NGO]]s.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com" /&gt; [[President of the United States|US President]] [[George W. Bush]] acknowledged the existence of secret prisons operated by the CIA during a speech on 6 September 2006.&lt;ref name="cnn.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk" /&gt;

====2007 status of ghost detainees====
{{main|Ghost detainee}}
A 50-page  [[Human Rights Watch]] report, "Ghost Prisoner: Two Years in Secret CIA Detention," contains a detailed description of a secret CIA prison from a Palestinian former detainee who was released from custody the previous year. Human Rights Watch has also sent a public letter to U.S. President George W. Bush requesting information about the fate and whereabouts of the missing detainees.&lt;ref name="HRWghost"&gt;{{citation

"President Bush told us that the last 14 CIA prisoners were sent to Guantanamo, but there are many other prisoners 'disappeared' by the CIA whose fate is still unknown," said Joanne Mariner, terrorism and counterterrorism director at Human Rights Watch. "The question is: what happened to these people and where are they now?"&lt;ref name="HRW2007-02-27"&gt;{{Citation

In early September 2006, 14 detainees were transferred from secret CIA prisons to military custody at Guantanamo Bay. In a televised speech on 6 September 2006, President Bush announced that with those 14 transfers, no prisoners were left in CIA custody.

In the early 1970s, the Congress became concerned over the apparent absence of clear policy guidelines and the use of program funds to support repressive regimes that committed human rights' abuses. As a result, "the [[United States Congress|Congress]] determined that it was inadvisable for the United States to continue supporting any foreign police organizations".&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05" /&gt; Both the CIA and military intelligence with  [[Counter-intelligence#Counterintelligence force protection source operations|Counterintelligence Force Protection Source Operations]]&lt;ref name="Gleghorn"&gt;{{citation

The [[Bureau of Diplomatic Security]], under the [[Department of State]] representatives at any embassy is expected to be aware of all contacts between US personnel and local law enforcement organizations.  The 1973 legislation significantly limited police training of all sorts, partially in response to human rights concerns.

The majority of this training went to Latin America, but some did go to countries elsewhere in the world, according to Senator [[Alan Cranston]],&lt;ref name="Cranston1992"&gt;{{citation
 | journal = [[Congressional Record]]
 | title= U.S. Security
 | date=5 March 1992
 | page= S2874 [Senate]
 | url = https://fas.org/irp/gao/920300-train.htm
}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially those with narcotics or terrorism problems. Cranston cited six reasons why the Congress, in 1974, banned police training, after learning of training and equipping "police in [[Iran]], [[Vietnam]], [[Brazil]], and other countries were involved in torture, murder, and the suppression of legitimate political activity":

{{quote|First, training was provided to so-called friendly anti-Communist regimes, without regard to whether they were dictatorships or not.

Second, law enforcement efforts were subordinated to U.S. counterinsurgency goals. As the GAO noted, U.S. training included such topics as counterinsurgency techniques, weapons use, and Communist ideology. This also meant, in practice, reinforcing the control of recipient countries' militaries over the police.

Third, and this is clearly borne out in the [[A. J. Langguth|Langguth]] book,&lt;ref name="Langguth"&gt;{{Citation
 | title = [[Hidden Terrors: The Truth About U.S. Police Operations in Latin America]]
 | author =  Langguth, A.J.
  | authorlink =A. J. Langguth
 | publisher = Pantheon
 | year = 1978
}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. trainers were not always the best America had to offer.

Fourth, U.S. intelligence agencies were given an important role in the development and execution of these programs.

Fifth, police training was not placed in the broader context of administration of justice, with its emphasis on judicial and prison reform.

And, finally, human rights was rarely a factor in policy considerations at the time.}}

Cranston went on to say,

{{quote|This ban remained virtually ironclad until 1985, when Congress authorized the President to support `programs to enhance investigative capabilities conducted under judicial or prosecutorial control' in functioning democracies in the Western hemisphere.

As a result, the Department of Justice--together with the State Department and the Agency for International Development--established the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program [[ICITAP]]. Operational responsibility was left entirely to ICITAP under the supervision of officials in the Deputy Attorney General's office, with policy guidance provided by the Department of State.}}

In principle, training and assistance to police, as opposed to military organization, is against US law, but the relevant law allows Presidential waiver of most provisions. A GAO report&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05"&gt;{{citation
 | title = Foreign Aid: Police Training and Assistance; report to Congressional requesters
 | author = [[U.S. General Accounting Office]], National Security and International Affairs Division

&lt;blockquote&gt;... provides information on (1) the legislative authority for providing assistance to foreign law enforcement agencies and personnel, (2) the extent and cost of U.S. activities, and (3) experts' opinions on the management of these programs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===General Accounting Office investigation===

In 1973 and 1974, the Congress enacted legislation forbidding U.S. agencies from using foreign economic or military assistance funds to assist foreign police, but it subsequently granted numerous exemptions to permit assistance in some countries and in various aspects of police force development, including material and weapons support, force management, narcotics control, and [[counterterrorism]] tactics. The 1974 prohibition did not apply to the use of other funds by agencies such as the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ) or [[United States Department of Transportation]] (DOT) to train or assist foreign law enforcement personnel.

No government agency is in charge of calculating the cost. However, the General Accounting Office identified 125 countries that received U.S. training and assistance for their police forces during fiscal year 1990 at a cost of at least $117 million.&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05Results"&gt;{{citation

The prohibition did not apply to Drug Enforcement Administration [[DEA]] and Federal Bureau of Investigation [[FBI]] assistance to combat international narcotics trafficking.

During fiscal year 1990 at a cost of about $117 million, the GAO estimated the major programs were: U.S. programs providing :
*[[United States Department of State]](DOS)International Narcotics Control($45 million) Antiterrorism Assistance ($10 million)
*[[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] ICITAP ($20 million)
**[[United States Department of Defense]]'s (DOD) national police forces assistance ($42 million).&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05App2AT"&gt;{{citation

a clear policy, or program objectives, on the role of U.S. assistance to police forces in the new and emerging democracies, a focal point for coordination and decision-making, and a means for determining whether individual programs and activities support U.S. policy or contribute to overall U.S. interests.

They noted that each program is managed individually, and the only place that coordination is occurring is at the U.S. embassy in the country.

====Scope and methodology on investigation on CIA training assistance====

The US [[General Accounting Office]] obtained information on CIA training and assistance provided to foreign law enforcement personnel, reviewed the legislative authority for providing this training and assistance, and identified efforts to coordinate these activities. They did not review program implementation in recipient countries. They interviewed officials and obtained records from AID and the Departments of State, Justice, and Defense, in Washington, D.C.; reviewed legislation and agency legal opinions on foreign police assistance; interviewed academic and legal experts on current U.S. assistance to foreign police; and reviewed literature published on foreign police assistance and AID's public safety program.&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05Scope"&gt;{{citation

===Legislative exemptions to the prohibition on U.S. assistance to foreign police===
Congressionally approved exemptions generally authorize activities that benefit a specific U.S. goal, such as countering the terrorist threat to U.S. citizens overseas or combating drug trafficking.&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05AppI"&gt;{{citation

Exemptions were also extended by:
*The International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1981 - for [[Haiti]]&lt;ref name="ISDC-1989"&gt;The International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1981 (U.S. Congress): P.L. 97-113, sec. 721(d), 95 stat. 1519&lt;/ref&gt;
*International Security and Development Assistance Authorizations Act of 1983 - antiterrorism program to allow training in relation to aviation security, crisis management, document screening techniques, facility security, maritime security, protection for [[VIP]]s, and handling of detector dogs.&lt;ref&gt;International Security and Development Assistance Authorizations Act of 1983&lt;/ref&gt;
*International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985 - El Salvador &amp; [[Honduras]]&lt;ref name="ISD1985"&gt;International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985&lt;/ref&gt;
It also expanded the judicial reform program and the police training exemption to countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. In 1988 the Congress further expanded the judicial reform program to allow police assistance to promote investigative and forensic skills, develop law enforcement training curricula, and improve administration and management of law enforcement organizations. This act specifically prohibited the Department of Defense (DOD) and the U.S. armed forces from providing training under this program.&lt;ref name="ISD1985" /&gt;

Maritime subjects were exempted from the section 660 prohibition, as well as the prohibition for any country that has a long-standing democratic tradition, does not have armed forces, and does not engage in a consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights. The act permitted such countries to receive any type of police assistance.

*International Narcotics Control Acts
This series of acts approved certain police assistance activities in [[Latin America]] and the Caribbean for narcotics control purposes. The 1988 act expanded DOD's role and allowed it to provide training and weapons and ammunition in fiscal years 1989 and 1990 to foreign police units that are specifically organized for narcotics enforcement in eligible countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. This act also allowed economic support funds to be provided to Colombian police for the protection of judges, government officials, and members of the press against narco-terrorist attacks. The 1989 Act extended DOD's authority to train police units in [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], and [[Peru]] in fiscal year 1990, if the units are only for narcotics enforcement.  It also allowed DOD to provide, in addition to weapons and ammunition, other defense articles such as helicopters, vehicles, radios, and personnel gear.
The 1990 act authorized DOD to continue to train and equip police forces in the [[Andes|Andean region]].&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05IntNarc"/&gt;
*Urgent Assistance for Democracy in Panama Act of 1990 - after the U.S. invasion of [[Panama]], the Congress significantly enhanced the U.S. role in the development of the new police force in Panama. T.&lt;ref&gt;Urgent Assistance for Democracy in Panama Act of 1990&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act for 1991 - Eastern Caribbean exemption&lt;ref&gt;The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act for 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other exceptions to police assistance prohibition====

In addition to the exemptions previously discussed, there are other authorities that waive the prohibition on assistance to police forces of foreign countries. For example, the President may authorize foreign assistance when `it is important to the security interests of the United States'. This allows the President to waive any provision of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, including section 660.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, 22 USC 2364&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. assistance provided to foreign police===

====Antiterrorism assistance====

This aims to improve foreign governments' antiterrorist capabilities to better protect U.S. citizens and interests.&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05App2AT" /&gt; In 1990, the U.S. provided assistance to 49 countries at a cost of nearly $10 million. Sixty-two percent of the funds were spent in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Europe, and less than $500,000 was used to purchase equipment. The Department of State manages the program and contracts with other U.S. government agencies, state or local police departments, and private firms to conduct the training. The [[Federal Aviation Administration]],&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05App2AT" /&gt; U.S. [[Customs Service]], the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]], the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]], and the [[U.S. Marshals Service]] are regular trainers. In compliance with legislative requirements, most training takes place in the United States.

====International narcotics control====

One of the objectives of the Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics Matters (INM) international narcotics control training program is to strengthen host country enforcement and interdiction capabilities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} During fiscal year 1990, INM provided a minimum of $45 million in training and equipment to foreign police, principally in [[Mexico]], [[Jamaica]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]], [[Pakistan]], [[Thailand]], and [[Turkey]]. These are all narcotics producing and trafficking countries.

INM reimburses other U.S. government agencies, primarily the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Customs, and Coast Guard, to conduct the actual training. DEA provides narcotics investigative training, Customs teaches air, sea and land port search procedures, and [[Coast Guard]] teaches courses in maritime interdiction. Other agencies may also be requested to train on a reimbursable basis in areas where they have specific expertise. For example, DOD provides helicopter training to police in drug trafficking countries. Training is conducted both overseas and in the United States and is reviewed and approved by INM.&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05IntNarc"&gt;{{citation

In addition, DOD used military assistance funds to train and equip narcotics enforcement police in several drug producing and trafficking countries. Documents provided by DOD show that in fiscal year 1990, DOD provided training and equipment with a value of at least $17 million to Mexico, $1.3 million to Bolivia, $10 million to Colombia, $1 million to Ecuador, and $1 million to Peru. DOD officials informed us that training and equipment valued at more than these amounts may also have been provided. However, documentation was not available at the Washington, D.C., agency headquarters level that specified the amounts for law enforcement activities. The equipment provided consisted of UH-1 helicopters and spare parts, ammunition, small arms, riot control equipment, radios, and miscellaneous personal gear.

====Investigative and international police training====
In FY1986,  AID transferred funds to DOJ to design, develop, and implement projects to improve and enhance the investigative capabilities of law enforcement agencies in the Latin America and the Caribbean region. This was part of AID's effort to reform judicial systems. Using these funds, DOJ established the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP).&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05Train"&gt;{{citation

 | date=5 March 1992
 | chapter =INVESTIGATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL POLICE TRAINING
 | url = https://fas.org/irp/gao/920300-train.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operating under State Department oversight, ICITAP has conducted criminal justice sector needs assessments in the region and has expanded its training to include basic police management and police academy development. In fiscal year 1990, ICITAP received $7 million from the Department of State for its regional program. It trained more than 1,000 students from the Caribbean, Central and South America and sponsored 7 conferences. Training includes police management, criminal investigation, crime scene search, and forensic medicine courses. Except for students sent to training programs in the United States, ICITAP training takes place overseas.

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) also provides limited training for foreign law enforcement officials.&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05Train" /&gt; Each year approximately 100 international police officials attend the 11-week college level course at the FBI National Academy that includes studies on management and forensic sciences. The FBI pays for the training and subsistence, but does not pay for the students' transportation. Over the last 10 years, more than 1,100 foreign police officials from 89 countries have graduated from this course.

Using its own funds, the FBI created two training courses:
*Training for Mexican police to better assist the United States in its investigations. Mexican officers receive a 3-day course in basic law enforcement techniques to include crime scene management, collection and preservation of evidence, hostage negotiations, forensic science, and investigative techniques. Since 1987, over 400 Mexican border police have been trained. FBI officials stated that the FBI plans to establish a training school in Mexico during 1992 at an estimated cost of about $250,000 annually, excluding salaries.
*The second course developed by the FBI for foreign police was to provide mid-level management training for police officials from the Pacific Island nations. The 4-week course includes first-line supervision, investigative techniques, and hostage negotiations. During 1991, 52 students graduated from the course held in [[Guam]] at a cost to the FBI of about $35,000. About 50 students are expected to attend this course during the spring of 1992.

The FBI also provides other training and assistance to foreign police as requested, but the cost is unknown.&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05Train" /&gt; For example, the [[National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime]] provided training to [[Canada|Canadian]] police. The Criminal Investigative Division conducted a training seminar for officers from Italy's three national law enforcement agencies on the use of sensitive investigative techniques such as the operation of confidential sources, undercover operations, and electronic surveillance. The FBI also furnishes on-the-job assistance to governments who request help during particularly difficult or sensitive investigations.

====Counterterrorism and military assistance====
DOD supplies a limited amount of military training and assistance to police officials. During fiscal years 1986 and 1987, DOD trained and equipped the El Salvadoran and Honduran police to counter urban terrorist activities.&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05Train" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05CTMA"&gt;{{citation

 | date=5 March 1992
 | chapter =COUNTERTERRORISM AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE
 | url = https://fas.org/irp/gao/920300-train.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This assistance was authorized in response to the murder of U.S. Marines by terrorists in El Salvador and was managed and delivered by the U.S. Army Military Police. The assistance consisted of training in counterterrorism techniques and the supply of police vehicles, communications, weapons, and other equipment. This effort cost $19.8 million, of which $17 million was provided to El Salvador.

In fiscal year 1990, DOD spent $6.4 million in previously authorized but unused military assistance funds to purchase needed equipment and weapons for Panama's newly formed national police force. Items procured included police vehicles, communications equipment, small arms, and personal gear. This assistance was a one-time, emergency program.

DOD has an ongoing military assistance program to support Costa Rican police. In fiscal year 1990, DOD supplied $431,000 in military equipment and $232,000 in military training to the Costa Rican Civil Guard to help them carry out their responsibility to protect the border regions of the country. DOD provided equipment such as vehicles, personnel gear, and radios, and military training in areas such as coastal operations. Additionally, DOD conducted technical training courses in equipment maintenance and medical skills among others.&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05CTMA" /&gt;

DOD, along with the United Kingdom, supports the Eastern Caribbean Regional Security System&lt;ref name="CIP"&gt;{{citation 
 | url = http://ciponline.org/facts/ecr03.htm
 | author = Center for International Policy
 | title = Eastern Caribbean Overview
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2015}} that was formed after the U.S. intervention in [[Grenada]]. The Security System is composed of a few permanently assigned military officers, but largely depends upon island nation police officers who can be called up for military duty in case of emergency. The United States equips and trains these personnel to prepare them for such an eventually. In fiscal year 1990, DOD provided $4.2 million in military assistance funds that were used to purchase equipment such as jeeps, small arms, uniforms, and communications gear. DOD also provided $300,000 for training in special operations, rural patrol, field survival, and surveillance, as well as technical courses in communications, navigation, maintenance, and medicine.

====Difficulties in determining cost and extent of assistance====
Since some agencies fund assistance out of their own budgets, without necessarily having a line item for police assistance, the GAO "could not accurately determine the extent or cost of assistance to foreign police" In the GAO estimates, "some double counting of students may be occurring and agencies may not be differentiating between assistance provided to police and assistance provided to the military." This might happen when "the agency supplying the training and the agency paying for the training may both include the trainees in their reporting systems, such as when ICITAP pays for students attending the FBI academy."

While the DOJ was asked to calculate information on its work with foreign police, it could not assign a dollar value to items including "travel expenses, salaries, and expendable items such as course materials." H.&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05PolAsst"&gt;{{citation

 | chapter = Appendix II. U.S. Assistance Provided to Foreign Police: DIFFICULTIES IN DETERMINING COST AND EXTENT OF ASSISTANCE
 | url = https://fas.org/irp/gao/920300-train.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
"Also, GAO could not always determine whether a student was a police officer or a military member because some agencies do not collect such data, DOD officials informed us that once they receive permission to train police in a specific activity they do not provide a further accounting breakdown. For example, training provided to the Eastern Caribbean Regional Security System was for law enforcement personnel, although a few trainees may have belonged to military organizations."

==Human experimentation==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2014}}
Project [[MKULTRA]], or [[MK-ULTRA]], was the code name for a CIA mind-control research program that began in 1950, involved primarily with the experimentation of drugs and other "chemical, biological and radiological" stimuli on both willing and uninformed subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=471+U.S.+159&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,33&amp;case=16297847318525168348&amp;scilh=0 CIA v. Sims], 471 U.S. 159, 161-162 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rockefeller Commission===
In December 1974, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the CIA had conducted illegal domestic activities, including experiments on U.S. citizens, during the 1960s. The report prompted investigations by both the U.S. Congress (in the form of the [[Church Committee]]) and a presidential commission (known as the [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]]). The congressional investigations and the Rockefeller Commission report revealed that the CIA and the Department of Defense had in fact conducted experiments to influence and control human behavior through the use of psychoactive drugs such as LSD and mescaline and other chemical, biological, and psychological means. Experiments were often conducted without the subjects' knowledge or consent.

MK-ULTRA was started on the order of CIA director Allen Dulles, largely in response to alleged Soviet, Chinese, and North Korean use of mind-control techniques on U.S. prisoners of war in Korea. The goal of the experiments was to study mind-control in order to develop methods of interrogation and behavior modification and manipulation, as well as to develop a possible [[truth drug]].

===Outcome===
[[MK-ULTRA]] research ultimately proved useless to the CIA and they have abandoned the program. Because most MK-ULTRA records were deliberately destroyed in 1973 by order of then CIA Director Richard Helms, it is difficult if not impossible to have a complete understanding of the more than 150 individually funded research sub-projects sponsored by MK-ULTRA and related CIA programs.

Following the recommendations of the [[Church Committee]], President Gerald Ford in 1976 issued the first Executive Order on Intelligence Activities which, among other things, prohibited "experimentation with drugs on human subjects, except with the informed consent, in writing and witnessed by a disinterested party, of each such human subject" and in accordance with the guidelines issued by the National Commission. Subsequent orders by Presidents Carter and Reagan expanded the directive to apply to any human experimentation.

==Assassination and targeted killing==
{{Main|Targeted killing}}
:''See [[United States involvement in regime change]]

===Targeted Killing===
At least since World War II, a distinction has been drawn between assassination of civilian leaders, and [[targeted killing]]s of leaders of fighting organizations. Some cases were blurry, such as the British-Czech [[Operation Anthropoid]], the killing of uniformed SS officer [[Reinhard Heydrich]], the acting [[Reichsprotektor]] of [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|The Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. A failed attempt, by British troops, to kill [[Field Marshal]] [[Erwin Rommel]] was clearly aimed at a military leader, as was the successful shooting down of [[Admiral]] [[Death of Isoroku Yamamoto|Isoroku Yamamoto]].

CIA has admitted being involved in assassination attempts against foreign leaders. Recently, there have been targeted killings of suspected terrorists, typically with missiles fired from [[unmanned aerial vehicles]], in a manner that a number of legal authorities believe was a legitimate act as opposed to a prohibited assassination.

===Assassinations===
Of the cases cited, it appears that no CIA personnel or even directly controlled foreign agents personally killed any leader, but there certainly were cases where the CIA knew of, or supported, plots to overthrow foreign leaders. In the cases of Lumumba in 1960/61 and Castro in the 50s and 60s, the CIA was involved in preparing to kill the individual. In other cases, such as Diem, the Agency knew of a plot but did not warn him, and communications at White House level indicated that the Agency had, with approval, told the plotters the US didn't object to their plan. The gun or poison, however, was not in the hands of a CIA officer.

CIA personnel were involved in attempted assassinations of foreign government leaders such as [[Fidel Castro]].  They provided support to those that killed [[Patrice Lumumba]]. In yet another category was noninterference in the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) coup in which President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] was killed.

A distinction has been drawn between political assassinations and [[CIA transnational anti-terrorism activities#Targeted killing in war versus assassination|"targeted killing" of leaders of non-state belligerents]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

====Castro====
{{Original research section|date=June 2015}}
{{main|Assassination attempts on Fidel Castro}}
Perhaps the best-documented account of CIA-sponsored assassination plans were against [[President]] [[Fidel Castro]] of [[Cuba]].

According to columnist Jack Anderson,&lt;ref name="Anderson1971-06-18"&gt;{{citation
 | journal = Washington Post

 | title = 6 Attempts to Kill Castro laid to CIA
}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first attempt was part of the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] operation, but five more teams were sent, the last apprehended on a rooftop within rifle range of Castro, at the end of February or beginning of March 1963. Anderson speculated that President [[Fidel Castro]] may have become aware of it, and somehow recruited [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] to retaliate against President [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/cuba/9151787/Fidel-Castro-knew-Lee-Harvey-Oswald-would-assassinate-John-F-Kennedy.html|title=Fidel Castro 'knew Lee Harvey Oswald would assassinate John F Kennedy'|last=Allen|first=Nick|date=2012-03-19|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maheu was identified as the team leader, who recruited [[John Roselli]], a gambler with contacts in the American and Cuban underworlds. The CIA assigned two operations officers, [[William King Harvey]] and James O'Connell, to accompany Roselli to Miami to recruit the actual teams.

Anderson's story appears to be confirmed by two CIA documents, the first referring to an Inspector General report of investigation of allegations that the Agency conspired to assassinate Fidel Castro. The story first appeared in Drew Pearson's column and has since appeared in Jack Anderson's column. "While the columns contained many factual errors, the allegations are basically true.&lt;ref name="NSAEBB222-1973-05-08"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the CIA was aware "Roselli intended to expose his participation in the plot should we not intervene in his behalf. The DCI at the time, [[John McCone]],  decided to take a calculated risk and accept the consequences of possible disclosure. Two articles by [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] discuss the plot, as well the ''Washington Post'' Sunday magazine, ''Parade''

Individuals who were aware of this project were: [[Director of Central Intelligence]] [[Allen Dulles]], [[Richard M. Bissell Jr.]] (Deputy Director for Plans (DDP)) Colonel [[J.C. King]] (Chief, Western Hemisphere Division, DDP), Colonel [[Sheffield Edwards]], [[William Harvey]], and [[James P. O'Connell]]. Also included were [[Robert Maheu|Robert A. Maheu]] (former FBI agent, public relations agent who did work for the CIA, and later an aide to [[Howard Hughes]]), and his attorneys Edward P. Morgan and [[Edward Bennett Williams]].

On 26 February 1971, Osborne arranged with the Commissioner of the U.S. [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] to flag any deportation. INS confirmed they did this again for 1972.

====Diem====
In summary, CIA, Embassy, and other US personnel, up to White House level, were aware of yet another coup being planned against [[President]] [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] of [[South Vietnam]]. While the US had no direct participation in the coup, the plotters were told, in a deniable way, that the US did not object to it. No documentary evidence has surfaced that the US knew that Diem and his brother were to be killed, and it is unclear that all the Vietnamese plotters knew or agreed to it. [[President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] was aware of the coup plans, but apparently had not considered the hazard to Diem.

According to the ''Pentagon Papers'', the final US loss of confidence in Diem began when his government violently suppressed a protest on Buddha's Birthday, 8 May 1963. Up to that point, the majority Buddhists had not been very politically active, even though Diem had given preference to the Catholic minority. Quickly, however, the Buddhists put a "cohesive and disciplined [political] organization" into action. By June, the situation moved from dissidence from a religious group to a "grave crisis of public confidence".&lt;ref name="PP2-4-201"&gt;{{citation

Then-Ambassador [[Frederick Nolting]] had tried to persuade Diem to moderate government action against Buddhists, but with no success. While Nolting was on leave, [[President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] appointed [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]] as the new Ambassador. In June 1963, senior leaders began, for the first time, to discuss the effect of a coup to remove Diem. Nolting and the US military in Vietnam, however, argued that Diem was keeping chaos at bay. Nolting left permanently in mid-August, but the assurances from Diem died with multiple August 21 night raids on Buddhist temples in many parts of Vietnam. Two days later, a US representative was approached by generals considering a coup. On 23 August, the first contact with a U.S. representative was made by generals who had begun to plan a coup against Diem. They were told that the U.S. had determined that Diem's brother, who had led the raids on the Buddhists, could not stay in any kind of power, and that, "then, we must face the possibility that Diem himself cannot be preserved."

{{quote|A White House tape of President Kennedy and his advisers, published this week in a new book-and-CD collection and excerpted on the Web, confirms that top U.S. officials sought the 1 November 1963 coup against then-South Vietnamese leader Ngo Dinh Diem without apparently considering the physical consequences for Diem personally (he was murdered the following day). The taped meeting and related documents show that U.S. officials, including JFK, vastly overestimated their ability to control the South Vietnamese generals who ran the coup 40 years ago this week [November 2003].

The Kennedy tape from 29 October 1963 captures the highest-level White House meeting immediately prior to the coup, including the President's brother voicing doubts about the policy of support for a coup: "I mean, it's different from a coup in the Iraq or South American country; we are so intimately involved in this ...&lt;ref name="NSAEBB101"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An 8 May 1973 memorandum&lt;ref name="NSAEBB222-1973-05-08" /&gt; states that "An Inspector General report of  investigation of allegations that the Agency was instrumental in bringing about the assassination of [[President]] [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] of [[South Vietnam]]. The allegations were determined to be without foundation."

Nevertheless, the Pentagon Papers observed,

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the military coup d'etat against Ngo Dinh Diem, the U.S. must accept its full share of responsibility. Beginning in August 1963 we variously authorized, sanctioned and encouraged the coup efforts of the Vietnamese generals and offered full support for a successor government. In October we cut off aid to Diem in a direct rebuff, giving a green light to the generals. We maintained clandestine contact with them throughout the planning and execution of the coup and sought to review their operational plans and proposed new government. Thus, as the nine-year rule of Diem came to a bloody end, our complicity in his overthrow heightened our responsibilities and our commitment in an essentially leaderless Vietnam.&lt;ref name="PP2-4-201" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Lumumba====

The [[Church Committee]] concluded it had "solid evidence of a plot to assassinate [[Patrice Lumumba]] [the first elected [[Prime Minister]] of the [[Republic of Congo]]]. Strong hostility to Lumumba, voiced at the very highest levels of government may have been intended to initiate an assassination operation; at the least it engendered such an operation. The evidence indicates that it is likely that [[President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]'s expression of strong concern about Lumumba at a meeting of the National Security Council on 18 August 1960, was taken by ([[Director of Central Intelligence]]) [[Allen Dulles]] as authority to assassinate Lumumba. There is, however, testimony by Eisenhower Administration officials, and ambiguity and lack of clarity in the records of high-level policy meetings, which tends to contradict the evidence that the President intended an assassination effort against Lumumba. In a footnote, the Committee cited an unnamed official as saying he had heard Eisenhower order the assassination."

=====Approval discussions and meetings=====
The week after the August 18 NSC meeting, a presidential advisor reminded the Special Group of the "necessity for very straightforward action" against Lumumba and prompted a decision not to rule out consideration of "any particular kind of activity which might contribute to getting rid of Lumumba." The Special Group is one of the many names for the often-reorganized committee that approved CIA covert action proposals. It has been called the 303 committee, Special Group (counterinsurgency), Operations Advisory Group, 5412 committee, and Forty Committee. "The following day, Dulles cabled a CIA Station Officer in Leopoldville, Republic of the Congo,* that "in high quarters" the "removal" of Lumumba was "an urgent and prime objective."

&lt;blockquote&gt;Shortly thereafter the CIA's clandestine service formulated a plot to assassinate Lumumba. The plot proceeded to the point that lethal substances and instruments specifically intended for use in an assassination were delivered by the CIA to the Congo Station. There is no evidence that these instruments of assassination were actually used against Lumumba.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====Events overtaken by events=====
In the meantime, Lumumba was dismissed from his post by  Congolese [[President]] [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]], an act of dubious legality; in retaliation, Lumumba attempted to dismiss Kasa-Vubu from the presidency, an act of even more dubious legality. On 14 September, a coup d'état endorsed by the CIA and organized by Colonel [[Joseph Mobutu]] removed Lumumba from office.

Lumumba was killed, in 1961, by forces under the control of the [[President]], [[Moise Tshombe]] of [[State of Katanga|Katanga]], a province that had declared its independence of the Republic of the Congo. Lumumba was taken by Katangan soldiers commanded by Belgians, and eventually shot by a Katangan firing squad under Belgian leadership.

=====Planning in the clandestine services=====

The independent [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] was declared on 30 June 1960, with [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] as President and [[Patrice Lumumba]] as Prime Minister. It shared a name with the neighboring [[Republic of the Congo]] to the west, a French colony that also gained independence in 1960, and the two were normally differentiated by also stating the name of the relevant capital city, so Congo (Léopoldville) versus Congo (Brazzaville).

[[Larry Devlin]] became [[Chief of Station]] in Congo in July 1960, a mere 10 days after the country's independence from Belgium and shortly before Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]]'s two-month term in office, dismissal from power and ultimate execution. In his memoir, Devlin reveals that late in 1960, he received instructions from an agent ("Joe from Paris") who was relaying instructions from CIA headquarters that he (Devlin) was to effect the assassination of Lumumba. Various poisons, including one secreted in a tube of toothpaste, were proffered. The directive had come from the CIA Deputy Chief of Plans [[Richard M. Bissell, Jr.|Dick Bissell]], but Devlin wanted to know if it had originated at a higher level and if so, how high. "Joe" had been given to understand that it had come from President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], but Devlin to this day does not know for sure. Devlin writes (and has recently said in public speaking engagements) that he felt an assassination would have been "morally wrong" and likely to backfire and work against U.S. interests. In the event, he temporized, neglecting to act, and Lumumba was ultimately murdered by his enemies in [[State of Katanga|Katanga]], with Belgian government participation. U.S. intelligence was kept apprised.

The United Nations Security Council was called into session on 7 December 1960 to consider Soviet demands that the U.N. seek Lumumba's immediate release, the immediate restoration of Lumumba as head of the Congo government, the disarming of the forces of Mobutu, and the immediate evacuation of Belgians from the Congo.  Soviet Representative [[Valerian Zorin]] refused U.S. demands that he disqualify himself as Security Council President during the debate. [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], answering Soviet attacks against his Congo operations, said that if the U.N. forces were withdrawn from the Congo "I fear everything will crumble."

Following a U.N. report that Lumumba had been mistreated by his captors, his followers threatened (on 9 December 1960) to seize all Belgians and "start cutting off the heads of some of them" unless Lumumba was released within 48 hours.

====Mahdawi====
{{Main|CIA activities in Iraq}}
According to the [[Church Committee]] report:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In February 1960, CIA's Near East Division sought the endorsement of what the Division Chief &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[James H. Critchfield]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; called the "Health Alteration Committee" for its proposal for a "special operation" to "incapacitate" an [[Iraq]]i Colonel believed to be "promoting Soviet bloc political interests in Iraq." The Division sought the Committee's advice on a technique, "which while not likely to result in total disablement would be certain to prevent the target from pursuing his usual activities for a minimum of three months," adding: "We do not consciously seek subject's permanent removal from the scene; we also do not object should this complication develop."&amp;nbsp;... In April [1962], the [Health Alteration] Committee unanimously recommended to the DDP [Deputy Director for Plans, [[Richard M. Bissell Jr.]]] that a "disabling operation"  be undertaken, noting that the Chief of Operations advised that it would be "highly desirable." Bissell's deputy, [[Tracy Barnes]], approved on behalf of Bissell&amp;nbsp;... The approved operation was to mail a monogrammed handkerchief containing an incapacitating agent to the colonel from an Asian country. [James] Scheider [Science Advisor to Bissell] testified that, while he did not now recall the name of the recipient, he did remember mailing from the Asian country, during the period in question, a handkerchief "treated with some kind of material for the purpose of harassing that person who received it."&amp;nbsp;... During the course of this Committee's investigation, the CIA stated that the handkerchief was "in fact never received (if, indeed, sent)."

Mahdawi and some of his family members ''were'' stricken with a serious case of what Mahdawi dubbed "influenza" in 1962, but it is unknown whether this ailment was related to the CIA's plan to poison him; Nathan J.

====Trujillo====
An Inspector General report of investigation of allegations that the Agency was instrumental in bringing about the
assassination of [[Rafael Trujillo]], dictator of the [[Dominican Republic]]. Trujillo was effective head of government at the time of his assassination in 1961.

Conditions leading to a desire, by Dominicans, appeared to begin [[Johnny Abbes García|Johnny Abbes]], took control the Intelligence Military Service (the secret police), and the country developed more internal violence and increasingly isolated from other nations. This isolation compounded Trujillo's fears, prompting him to worsen his foreign interventionism.

To be sure, Trujillo did have cause to resent the leaders of some nations, such as Cuba's [[Fidel Castro Ruz|Fidel Castro]], who assisted a small, abortive invasion attempt by dissident Dominicans in 1959. Trujillo, however, expressed greater concern over Venezuela's president [[Rómulo Betancourt]] (1959–64). An established and outspoken opponent of Trujillo, Betancourt had been associated with some individual Dominicans who had plotted against the dictator. Trujillo developed an obsessive personal hatred towards Betancourt and supported numerous plots of Venezuelan exiles to overthrow him. This pattern of intervention led the Venezuelan government to take its case against Trujillo to the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS).

This development infuriated Trujillo, who ordered his foreign agents to plant a bomb inside Betancourt's car. The assassination attempt, carried out on 24 June 1960, injured but did not kill the Venezuelan president.The firestorm caused from the incident inflamed world opinion against Trujillo. The members of the OAS, expressing this outrage, voted unanimously to sever diplomatic relations and to impose strong economic sanctions on the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/military-history/the-assassination-of-rafael-trujillo/|title=The Assassination of Rafael Trujillo|website=warfarehistorynetwork.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally on the night of the 30 May 1961, Rafael Trujillo was shot to death on San Cristobal Avenue, Santo Domingo.  He was the victim of an ambush plotted by a number of Dominicans. According to American reporter [[Bernard Diederich]], the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) had supplied some of the guns used to kill the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Bernard Diederich]] |title=Trujillo. The Death of the Goat. |publisher=Little, Brown, and Co, 1978 |page=88| isbn=0-316-18440-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report to the Deputy [[Attorney General of the United States]], CIA officials described the agency as having "no active part" in the assassination and only a "faint connection" with the groups that planned the killing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/family_jewels_wilderotter.pdf Justice Department Memo, 1975;] [[National Security Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; but the internal CIA investigation, by its Inspector General, "disclosed quite extensive Agency involvement with the plotters."&lt;ref name="NSAEBB222-1973-05-08" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

====Sukarno====
According to an 86-page portion of the [[United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]] investigating the CIA's domestic activities that was removed at the behest of the [[Presidency of Gerald Ford|Ford administration]] and did not become public until 2016:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Richard] Bissell [Deputy Director of Plans for the CIA] also testified that there was discussion within the Agency of the possibility of an attempt on the life of President Achmed [[Sukarno]] of [[Indonesia]] which "progressed as far as the identification of an asset who it was felt might be recruited for this purpose. The plan was never reached, was never perfected to the point where it seemed feasible." He said the Agency had "absolutely nothing" to do with the death of Sukarno.&amp;nbsp;... He stated that no assassination plans would have been undertaken without authorization outside the Agency, and that no such authorization was undertaken for plans against either Lumumba or Sukarno.&amp;nbsp;... Since no evidence was found to bring the Sukarno and Lumumba matters within the scope of the Commission's investigative authority, no further investigation in these two areas was undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/dc.html?doc=2719480-Document-19|title=Summary of Facts: Investigation of CIA Involvement in Plans to Assassinate Foreign Leaders|work=[[United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States]]|date=1975-06-05|accessdate=2017-07-14|pp=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prados|first1=John|last2=Jimenez-Bacardi|first2=Arturo|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB543-Ford-White-House-Altered-Rockefeller-Commission-Report/|title=Gerald Ford White House Altered Rockefeller Commission Report in 1975; Removed Section on CIA Assassination Plots|work=[[National Security Archive]]|date=2016-02-29|accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European tribunal said the "two high-value prisoners" were "subjected to maltreatment and arbitrary incarceration at the CIA black site.

'''Idappaccayatā''' (Pali, also ''idappaccayata''; Sanskrit: ''idaṃpratyayatā'') is a [[Buddhist]] term that is translated as "specific conditionality" or "this/that conditionality". It refers to the principal of causality–that all things arise and exist due to certain causes (or conditions), and cease once these causes (or conditions) are removed. This principle is expressed in the following simple formula that is repeated hundreds of times in the Buddhist discourses:
{{quote|
When this is, that is.&lt;br /&gt;
From the arising of this comes the arising of that.&lt;br /&gt;
When this isn't, that isn't.&lt;br /&gt;
From the cessation of this comes the cessation of that.
}}

''Idappaccayatā'' (''specific conditionality''), as expressed in the above formula, is identified as a key expression of the doctrine of ''[[pratītyasamutpāda]]'' (''interdependent origination'').

==Expression of ''pratītyasamutpāda''==
''Idappaccayatā'' (this/that conditionality), as expressed in the this/that formula, is identified as a key expression of the doctrine of ''[[pratītyasamutpāda]]'' (interdependent origination).{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=idap|The this/that formula is considered to represent a key expression of ''[[pratītyasamutpāda]]'' (interdependent origination):
* Thich Nhat Hanh states: "The Buddha expressed interdependent Co-Arising very simply: "This is, because that is. This is not, because that is not. This comes to be, because that comes to be. This ceases to be, because that ceases to be." These sentences occur hundreds of times in both the Northern and Southern transmissions. They are the Buddhist genesis."{{sfn|Thich Nhat Hanh|1999|pp=221-222}}
* Peter Harvey states: In its abstract form, the doctrine states: 'That being, this comes to be; from the arising of that, this arises; that being absent, this is not; from the cessation of that, this ceases.' (S.II.28) This states the principle of conditionality, that all things, mental and physical, arise and exist due to the presence of certain conditions, and cease once their conditions are removed: nothing (except ''Nibbana'') is independent.{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=54}}
* Christina Feldman states: "The basic principle of dependent origination is simplicity itself. The Buddha described it by saying: 'When there is this, that is. / With the arising of this, that arises. / When this is not, neither is that. / With the cessation of this, that ceases.' When all of these cycles of feeling, thought, bodily sensation, all of these cycles of mind and body, action, and movement, are taking place upon a foundation of ignorance—that’s called samsara.&lt;ref group=web name=feldman1&gt;Feldman, Christina. "Dependent Origination," http://www.dharma.org/ij/archives/1999a/christina.htm. Accessed 25 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Joseph Goldstien states: "At the heart of his teaching is the principle of dependent origination: because of this, that arises; when this ceases, that also ceases. The law of dependent origination is central to understanding not only the arising of our precious human birth, but also the unfolding process of life itself, in all its pain and beauty."{{sfn|Goldstein|2011|p=53}}
* Rupert Gethin: "Another succinct formula states the principle of causality (idaṃpratyayatā) as ‘this existing, that exists; this arising, that arises; this not existing, that does not exist; this ceasing, that ceases’. (Majjhima Nikāya iii. 63; Samyutta Nikāya v. 387; etc.) ...the succinct formula state[s] baldly that the secret of the universe lies in the nature of causality—the way one thing leads to another.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=141}} }} For example, Thich Nhat Hanh states:{{sfn|Thich Nhat Hanh|1999|pp=221-222}} 
: The Buddha expressed interdependent Co-Arising very simply: "This is, because that is. This is not, because that is not. This comes to be, because that comes to be. This ceases to be, because that ceases to be." These sentences occur hundreds of times in both the Northern and Southern transmissions. They are the Buddhist genesis.

Rupert Gethin states "..the succinct formula state[s] baldly that the secret of the universe lies in the nature of causality—the way one thing leads to another."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=141}}

===Equivalence to ''pratītyasamutpāda''===
Ajahn Payutto describes ''idappaccayatā'' as another name for ''pratītyasamutpāda''.&lt;ref group=web name=payutto&gt;[http://www.buddhistteachings.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Significance-of-Dependent-Origination.pdf Significance of Dependent Origination, by Ajahn Payutto]&lt;/ref&gt; Ajahn Payutto provides the following quote from the Pali sutta S. II. 25-6:&lt;ref group=web name=payutto/&gt;
{{quote|
Whether Tathāgatas [Buddhas] arise or not, that principle of specific conditionality [''idappaccayatā''] is constant, certain and a law of nature.
Having fully awakened to and penetrated to this truth, a Tathāgata announces it, teaches it, clarifies it, formulates it, reveals it, and analyzes it. And he says: ‘See! With ignorance as condition, there are volitional formations....
Thus, bhikkhus, this actuality (tathatā), this inerrancy (avitathatā), this invariability (anaññathatā)—this specific conditionality (idappaccayatā)—this is called dependent origination.}}

===Direct experience===
The Access to Insight glossary emphasizes that ''idappaccayatā'' relates to direct experience. The glossary states:&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/glossary.html#i Access to Insight glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;
: This name for the causal principle the Buddha discovered on the night of his Awakening stresses the point that, for the purposes of ending suffering and stress, the processes of causality can be understood entirely in terms of forces and conditions that are experienced in the realm of direct experience, with no need to refer to forces operating outside of that realm.

===Translations of this/that formula===
There are many translations of the ''idappaccayatā'' formula by contemporary scholars and translators. 
Contemporary translator Thanissaro Bikkhu provides the following translation:&lt;ref group=web name=sn1261&gt;Bhikkhu Thanissaro, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.061.than.html Assutavā Sutta: Uninstructed (SN 12.61)], Access To Insight, accessdate=5 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

From the arising of this comes the arising of that.&lt;br /&gt;

— AN 10.92

There are many possible ways of interpreting this formula, but only one does justice both to the way the formula is worded and to the complex, fluid manner in which specific examples of causal relationships are described in the Canon. That way is to view the formula as the interplay of two causal principles, one linear and the other synchronic, that combine to form a non-linear pattern. The linear principle — taking (2) and (4) as a pair — connects events, rather than objects, over time; the synchronic principle — (1) and (3) — connects objects and events in the present moment. The two principles intersect, so that any given event is influenced by two sets of conditions: input acting from the past and input acting from the present. Although each principle seems simple, the fact that they interact makes their consequences very complex.}}

===Repetition in the sutras===
The formula of ''idappaccayatā'' (''specific conditionality'') is repeated hundreds of times throughout the sutras. Thich Nhat Hanh states: "these sentences occur hundreds of times in both the Northern and Southern transmissions. They are the Buddhist genesis."{{sfn|Thich Nhat Hanh|1999|pp=221-222}}

==Etymology==
The Pali term ''idappaccayatā'', is composed of three Pali words: ''ida'', ''paccaya'' and ''tā''. Translator Patrick Kearney explains these terms as follows:&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.dharmasalon.net/Writings/Dependent%20arising/files/01_Introduction.pdf This is how I heard it, by Patrick Kearney]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
''Paccaya'' is derived from the verb ''pacceti'' ([...] “come back to,” fig. “fall back on,” “find one’s hold in”). Literally meaning “support,” its applied meaning is “reason, cause, ground, condition.” The other parts of the compound are: ''ida'', which means “this;” and the abstract suffix - ''tā''. }}

Ven. Dhammanando provides the following explanation:&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.dhammawheel.com/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=6014 Pali Term: Idappaccayatā]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
Idappaccayatā [equals] idaṃ + paccaya + tā.

‘Idaṃ’ means ‘this’, being the neuter nominative or accusative singular of the adjective/pronoun ‘ima’. However, when ‘idaṃ’ occurs in a compound word, with elision of the niggahīta, it may stand for any of the oblique cases of ‘ima’. Here it is understood by the commentators to stand for ‘imesaṃ’, the genitive plural — ‘of these’.

‘Paccaya’ [equals] ‘paccayā’ (nominative plural) — conditions.

The suffix ‘-tā’ forms a noun of state, like the English ‘-ness’.

Literally: “conditions-of-these-ness”}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1649">'''Inevitable disclosure''' is a [[legal doctrine]] through which an employer can claim [[trade secret]] to [[enjoin]] a former employee from working in a job that may result in the use of trade secrets without the need for proof or evidence.  

The inevitable-disclosure doctrine is one's means in demonstrating a revelation of trade secrets, and some have recently found some renewed judicial support. Where it is acceptable, the doctrine allows the court to find that a former employee would disclose proprietary information in their position with a new employer, even if there is no evidence of actual disclosure. Thus, allowing a company to make a critical showing, when it can't do so if required to come forward with evidence of misconduct. However, because it also rests on a prediction about a future harm, inevitable disclosure also is in tension with the general principle that injunctive relief will not be given to prevent a conjectural injury at any means.

The '''International System of Units''' ('''SI''', abbreviated from the [[French language|French]] ''{{lang|fr|Système international (d'unités)}}'') is the modern form of the [[metric system]], and is the most widely used [[system of measurement]]. It comprises a [[Coherence (units of measurement)|coherent]] system of [[units of measurement]] built on seven [[SI base unit|base unit]]s, which are the [[ampere]], [[kelvin]], [[second]], [[metre]], [[kilogram]], [[candela]], [[Mole (unit)|mole]], and a set of twenty [[Metric prefix|prefix]]es to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system also specifies names for 22 [[SI derived unit|derived units]], such as lumen and watt, for other common physical quantities.

The base units are derived from invariant constants of nature, such as the [[speed of light]] in vacuum and the [[triple point of water]], which can be observed and measured with great accuracy, and one physical artefact. The artefact is the [[international prototype kilogram]], certified in 1889, and consisting of a cylinder of [[Platinum-iridium alloy|platinum-iridium]], which nominally has the same mass as one litre of water at the freezing point. Its stability has been a matter of significant concern, culminating in a [[2019 redefinition of SI base units|proposed revision of the definition of the base units]] entirely in terms of constants of nature, scheduled to be put into effect on 20 May 2019.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}&lt;!-- unsuitable ref for this claim:&lt;ref name="25th CGPM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/25th-CGPM-Convocation.pdf#page=32 |title=Convocation of the General Conference on Weights and Measures (25th meeting) |page=32 |publisher=International Bureau of Weights and Measures |access-date=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Derived units may be defined in terms of base units or other derived units. They are adopted to facilitate measurement of diverse quantities. The SI is intended to be an evolving system; units and prefixes are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The most recent derived unit, the [[katal]], was defined in 1999.

The reliability of the SI depends not only on the precise measurement of standards for the base units in terms of various physical constants of nature, but also on precise definition of those constants. The set of underlying constants is modified as more stable constants are found, or may be more precisely measured. For example, in 1983 the metre was redefined as the distance that light propagates in vacuum in a given fraction of a second, thus making the value of the speed of light in terms of the defined units exact.
 
The motivation for the development of the SI was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the [[centimetre–gram–second system of units|centimetre–gram–second]] (CGS) systems (specifically the inconsistency between the systems of [[electrostatic units]] and [[electromagnetic units]]) and the lack of coordination between the various [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]]s that used them. The [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (French: ''{{lang|fr|Conférence générale des poids et mesures}}'' – CGPM), which was established by the [[Metre Convention]] of 1875, brought together many international organisations to establish the definitions and standards of a new system and standardise the rules for writing and presenting measurements. The system was published in 1960 as a result of an initiative that began in 1948. It is based on the [[MKS system of units|metre–kilogram–second system of units]] (MKS) rather than any variant of the CGS. Since then, the SI has been [[Metrication|adopted]] by all [[countries]] except the [[United States]], [[Liberia]] and [[Myanmar]].&lt;ref name="CIA Factbook Appendix G"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/appendix-g.html |title=The World Factbook Appendix G |publisher=CIA |access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Coherent SI units}} Units and prefixes==
The International System of Units consists of a set of [[SI base unit|base unit]]s, [[SI derived unit|derived unit]]s, and a set of decimal-based multipliers that are used as [[SI prefix|prefix]]es.&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|103–106}} The units, excluding prefixed units,&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For historical reasons, the kilogram rather than the gram is treated as the coherent unit, making an exception to this characterisation.&lt;/ref&gt; form a [[coherent system of units]], which is based on a system of quantities in such a way that the equations between the numerical values expressed in coherent units have exactly the same form, including numerical factors, as the corresponding equations between the quantities. For example, 1&amp;nbsp;N = 1&amp;nbsp;kg × 1&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; says that ''one'' newton is the force required to [[Acceleration|accelerate]] a mass of ''one'' kilogram at ''one'' [[metre per second squared]], as related through the principle of coherence to the equation relating the corresponding quantities: {{math|1=''F'' = ''m'' × ''a''}}.

Derived units apply to derived quantities, which may by definition be expressed in terms of base quantities, and thus are not independent; for example, [[electrical conductance]] is the inverse of [[electrical resistance]], with the consequence that the siemens is the inverse of the ohm, and similarly, the ohm and siemens can be replaced with a ratio of an ampere and a volt, because those quantities bear a defined relationship to each other.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Ohm's law: {{nowrap|1=1 Ω = 1 V/A}} from the relationship {{nowrap|1=''E'' = ''I'' × ''R''}}, where ''E'' is electromotive force or voltage (unit: volt), ''I'' is current (unit: ampere), and ''R'' is resistance (unit: ohm).&lt;/ref&gt; Other useful derived quantities can be specified in terms of the SI base and derived units that have no named units in the SI system, such as acceleration, which is defined in SI units as m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Base units===
{{main|SI base units}}
The SI base units are the building blocks of the system and all the other units are derived from them. When [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] first introduced the concept of a coherent system, he identified three quantities that could be used as base units: mass, length and time. [[Giovanni Giorgi|Giorgi]] later identified the need for an electrical base unit, for which the unit of electric current was chosen for SI. Another three base units (for temperature, amount of substance and luminous intensity) were added later.

The early metric systems defined a unit of weight as a base unit, while the SI defines an analogous unit of mass. In everyday use, these are mostly interchangeable, but in scientific contexts the difference matters. Mass, strictly the inertial mass, represents a quantity of matter. It relates the acceleration of a body to the applied force via [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's law]], {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''m'' × ''a''}}: force equals mass times acceleration. A force of 1&amp;nbsp;N (newton) applied to a mass of 1&amp;nbsp;kg will accelerate it at 1&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This is true whether the object is floating in space or in a gravity field e.g. at the Earth's surface. Weight is the force exerted on a body by a gravitational field, and hence its weight depends on the strength of the gravitational field. Weight of a 1&amp;nbsp;kg mass at the Earth's surface is {{nowrap|''m'' × ''g''}}; mass times the acceleration due to gravity, which is 9.81&amp;nbsp;newtons at the Earth's surface and is about 3.5&amp;nbsp;newtons at the surface of Mars. Since the acceleration due to gravity is local and varies by location and altitude on the Earth, weight is unsuitable for precision measurements of a property of a body, and this makes a unit of weight unsuitable as a base unit.

===Derived units===
{{main|SI derived unit}}
The derived units in the SI are formed by powers, products or quotients of the base units and are unlimited in number.&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|103}}&lt;ref name="NIST330"/&gt;{{rp|3}} Derived units are associated with derived quantities; for example, [[velocity]] is a quantity that is derived from the base quantities of time and length, and thus the SI derived unit is metre per second (symbol m/s). The dimensions of derived units can be expressed in terms of the dimensions of the base units.

Combinations of base and derived units may be used to express other derived units. For example, the SI unit of [[force]] is the [[Newton (unit)|newton]] (N), the SI unit of [[pressure]] is the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa)—and the pascal can be defined as one newton per square metre (N/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Units &amp; Symbols for Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineers |url=http://www.theiet.org/students/resources/units-symbols.cfm |publisher=Institution of Engineering and Technology |date=1996 |pages=8–11 |access-date=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prefixes===
{{main|Metric prefix}}
Prefixes are added to unit names to produce multiples and sub-multiples of the original unit. All of these are integer powers of ten, and above a hundred or below a hundredth all are integer powers of a thousand. For example, ''kilo-'' denotes a multiple of a thousand and ''milli-'' denotes a multiple of a thousandth, so there are one thousand millimetres to the metre and one thousand metres to the kilometre. The prefixes are never combined, so for example a millionth of a metre is a ''micrometre'', not a millimillimetre. Multiples of the kilogram are named as if the gram were the base unit, so a millionth of a kilogram is a ''milligram'', not a microkilogram.&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|122}}&lt;ref name="NIST811"&gt;{{cite book |author-first1=Ambler |author-last1=Thompson |author-first2=Barry N. |author-last2=Taylor |date=2008 |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf |title=Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI) (Special publication 811) |location=Gaithersburg, MD |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}} When prefixes are used to form multiples and submultiples of SI base and derived units, the resulting units are no longer coherent.&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|7}}

The BIPM specifies twenty prefixes for the International System of Units (SI):

{{SI prefixes (infobox)}}

===Non-SI units accepted for use with SI===
{{Main|non-SI units accepted for use with SI}}
Many non-SI units continue to be used in the scientific, technical, and commercial literature. Some units are deeply embedded in history and culture, and their use has not been entirely replaced by their SI alternatives. The CIPM recognised and acknowledged such traditions by compiling a list of [[non-SI units accepted for use with SI]], which are grouped as follows:&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|123–129}}&lt;ref name="NIST811"/&gt;{{rp|7–11}}&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;This grouping reflects the 2014 revision of the 8th Edition of the SI Brochure (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CubeLitre.svg|right|thumb|The litre is classed as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI.&lt;br /&gt;The litre differs from the SI coherent unit m{{sup|3}} by a factor 0.001 and is therefore not a [[Coherence (units of measurement)|coherent unit]] of measure with respect to SI.]]
*'''Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI''' (Table 6):
*:Certain units of time, angle, and legacy non-SI units have a long history of consistent use. Most societies have used the solar day and its non-decimal subdivisions as a basis of time and, unlike the [[Foot (unit)|foot]] or the [[Pound (mass)|pound]], these were the same regardless of where they were being measured. The [[radian]], being {{sfrac|2π}} of a revolution, has mathematical advantages but it is cumbersome for navigation{{fact|date=June 2018}}, and, as with time, the units used in navigation are largely consistent around the world. The [[tonne]], [[litre]], and [[hectare]] were adopted by the CGPM in 1879 and have been retained as units that may be used alongside SI units, having been given unique symbols. The catalogued units are
*::[[minute]], [[hour]], [[day]], [[Degree (angle)|degree of arc]], [[minute of arc]], [[second of arc]], [[hectare]], [[litre]], [[tonne]], [[astronomical unit]]
*:Some of the units listed in Table 7 and Table 8 are also accepted for use with the SI.
* '''Non-SI units whose values in SI units must be obtained experimentally''' (Table 7):
*:Physicists often use units of measure that are based on natural phenomena, particularly when the quantities associated with these phenomena are many orders of magnitude greater than or less than the equivalent SI unit. The most common ones have been catalogued in the SI Brochure together with consistent symbols and accepted values, but with the caveat that their values in SI units need to be measured.
*::[[electronvolt]] (symbol eV), and [[Atomic mass unit|dalton/unified atomic mass unit]] (Da or u)
[[File:Clinical Mercury Manometer.jpg|thumb|[[Sphygmomanometer]] – the traditional device that measures blood pressure using [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] in a manometer. Pressures are recorded in "[[Pressure measurement#Liquid column (manometer)|millimetres of mercury]]" – a non-SI unit]]
* '''Other non-SI units''' (Table 8):
*:A number of non-SI units that had never been formally sanctioned by the CGPM have continued to be used across the globe in many spheres including [[health care]] and [[navigation]]. As with the units of measure in Tables 6 and 7, these have been catalogued by the CIPM in the SI Brochure to ensure consistent usage, but with the recommendation that authors who use them should define them wherever they are used.
*::[[Bar (unit)|bar]], [[millimetre of mercury]], [[ångström]], [[nautical mile]], [[Barn (unit)|barn]], [[knot (unit)|knot]], [[neper]], bel and [[decibel]]
*:The neper, bel and decibel have been accepted for use with the SI by the CIPM.
*:In the interests of standardising health-related units of measure used in the nuclear industry, the 12th CGPM (1964) accepted the continued use of the [[curie]] (symbol Ci) as a non-SI unit of activity for radionuclides;&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|152}} the [[#Derived units|SI derived units]] becquerel, sievert and gray were adopted in later years. Similarly, the [[millimetre of mercury]] (symbol mmHg) was retained for measuring blood pressure.&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|127}}
* '''Non-SI units associated with the CGS and the CGS-Gaussian system of units''' (Table 9):
*:The SI manual also catalogues a number of legacy units of measure that are used in specific fields such as [[geodesy]] and [[geophysics]] or are found in the literature, particularly in [[Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field#Curved spacetime|classical and relativistic electrodynamics]] where they have certain advantages. The units that are catalogued are:
*::[[erg]], [[dyne]], [[Poise (unit)|poise]], [[Stokes (unit)|stokes]], [[Stilb (unit)|stilb]], [[phot]], [[Gal (unit)|gal]], [[Maxwell (unit)|maxwell]], [[Gauss (unit)|gauss]], and [[oersted]].

===Common notions of the metric units===
The basic units of the metric system, as originally defined, represented common quantities or relationships in nature. They still do – the modern precisely defined quantities are refinements of definition and methodology, but still with the same magnitudes. In cases where laboratory precision may not be required or available, or where approximations are good enough, the original definitions may suffice.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;While the second is readily determined from the Earth's rotation period, the metre, originally defined in terms of the Earth's size and shape, is less amenable; however, that the Earth's circumference is very close to 40,000&amp;nbsp;km may be a useful mnemonic.&lt;/ref&gt;

*A second is 1/60 of a minute, which is 1/60 of an hour, which is 1/24 of a day, so a second is 1/86400 of a day; a second is the time it takes a dense object to freely fall 4.9 metres from rest.
*The metre is close to the length of a pendulum that has a period of 2 seconds; most dining tabletops are about 0.75 metre high; a very tall human (basketball forward) is about 2 metres tall.
*The kilogram is the mass of a litre of cold water; a cubic centimetre or millilitre of water has a mass of one gram; a 1-euro coin, 7.5&amp;nbsp;g; a Sacagawea US 1-dollar coin, 8.1&amp;nbsp;g; a UK 50-pence coin, 8.0&amp;nbsp;g.
*A candela is about the luminous intensity of a moderately bright candle, or 1 candle power; a 60&amp;nbsp;W tungsten-filament incandescent light bulb has a luminous intensity of about 64 candela.
*A mole of a substance has a mass that is its [[molecular mass]] expressed in units of grams; the mass of a mole of table salt is 58.4&amp;nbsp;g.
*A temperature difference of one kelvin is the same as one degree Celsius: 1/100 of the temperature differential between the freezing and boiling points of water at sea level; the absolute temperature in kelvins is the temperature in degrees Celsius plus about 273; human body temperature is about 37&amp;nbsp;°C or 310&amp;nbsp;K.
*A 60&amp;nbsp;W incandescent light bulb consumes 0.5 amperes at 120&amp;nbsp;V (US mains voltage) and about 0.26 amperes at 230&amp;nbsp;V (European mains voltage).

==Lexicographic conventions==
===Unit names===
The symbols for the SI units are intended to be identical, regardless of the language used,&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|130–135}} but unit names are ordinary nouns and use the character set and follow the grammatical rules of the language concerned. Names of units follow the grammatical rules associated with [[common noun]]s: in English and in French they start with a lowercase letter (e.g., newton, hertz, pascal), even when the symbol for the unit begins with a capital letter. This also applies to "degrees Celsius", since "degree" is the unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/symbol.html |title=Using Abbreviations or Symbols |date=2004-07-14 |access-date=2013-12-11 |author-first=Russ |author-last=Rowlett |publisher=[[University of North Carolina]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npl.co.uk/reference/measurement-units/si-conventions/ |title=SI Conventions |access-date=2013-12-11 |publisher=National Physical Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official British and American spellings for certain SI units differ – [[British English]], as well as Australian, Canadian and New Zealand English, uses the spelling ''deca-'', ''metre'', and ''litre'' whereas [[American English]] uses the spelling ''deka-'', ''meter'', and ''liter'', respectively.&lt;ref name="NIST330"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

===Unit symbols and the values of quantities {{anchor|SI_writing_style}}===
Although the writing of unit names is language-specific, the writing of unit symbols and the values of quantities is consistent across all languages and therefore the SI Brochure has specific rules in respect of writing them.&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|130–135}} The guideline produced by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST)&lt;ref name="nist style"&gt;
{{Cite web |url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec07.html |title=NIST Guide to SI Units&amp;nbsp;– Rules and Style Conventions |access-date=2009-12-29 |author-last1=Thompson |author-first1=A. |date=July 2008 |author-last2=Taylor |author-first2=B. N. |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; clarifies language-specific areas in respect of American English that were left open by the SI Brochure, but is otherwise identical to the SI Brochure.&lt;ref name="NISTInterprepation"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2008-05-09 |url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2008/pdf/E8-11058.pdf |title=Interpretation of the International System of Units (the Metric System of Measurement) for the United States |journal=Federal Register |volume=73 |issue=96 |pages=28432–28433 |id=FR Doc number E8-11058 |access-date=2009-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====General rules====
General rules&lt;ref name="generalrules" group="Note"&gt;Except where specifically noted, these rules are common to both the SI Brochure and the NIST brochure.&lt;/ref&gt; for writing SI units and quantities apply to text that is either handwritten or produced using an automated process:
* The value of a quantity is written as a number followed by a space (representing a multiplication sign) and a unit symbol; e.g., 2.21&amp;nbsp;kg, {{val|7.3|e=2|u=m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, 22&amp;nbsp;K. This rule explicitly includes the percent sign (%)&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp |134}} and the symbol for degrees of temperature (°C).&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|133}} Exceptions are the symbols for plane angular degrees, minutes, and seconds (°,&amp;nbsp;&amp;prime;, and&amp;nbsp;&amp;Prime;), which are placed immediately after the number with no intervening space.
* Symbols are mathematical entities, not abbreviations, and as such do not have an appended period/full stop (.), unless the rules of grammar demand one for another reason, such as denoting the end of a sentence.
* A prefix is part of the unit, and its symbol is prepended to a unit symbol without a separator (e.g., k in km, M in MPa, G in GHz, μ in μg). Compound prefixes are not allowed. A prefixed unit is atomic in expressions (e.g., km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is equivalent to (km)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).
* Symbols for derived units formed by multiplication are joined with a [[dot operator|centre dot]] (⋅) or a non-breaking space; e.g., N⋅m or N&amp;nbsp;m.
* Symbols for derived units formed by division are joined with a [[solidus (punctuation)|solidus]] (/), or given as a negative [[exponent]]. E.g., the "metre per second" can be written m/s, m&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, or {{sfrac|m|s}}. A solidus must not be used more than once in a given expression without parentheses to remove ambiguities; e.g., kg/(m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and kg⋅m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; are acceptable, but kg/m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is ambiguous and unacceptable.
[[File:981ms2.png|thumb|Acceleration due to gravity.&lt;br /&gt;The lowercase letters (neither "metres" nor "seconds" were named after people), the space between the value and the units, and the superscript "2" to denote "squared".]]
* The first letter of symbols for units derived from the name of a person is written in [[upper case]]; otherwise, they are written in [[lower case]]. E.g., the unit of [[pressure]] is named after [[Blaise Pascal]], so its symbol is written "Pa", but the symbol for mole is written "mol". Thus, "T" is the symbol for [[tesla (unit)|tesla]], a measure of [[magnetic field strength]], and "t" the symbol for [[tonne]], a measure of [[mass]]. Since 1979, the [[litre]] may exceptionally be written using either an uppercase "L" or a lowercase "l", a decision prompted by the similarity of the lowercase letter "l" to the numeral "1", especially with certain typefaces or English-style handwriting. The American NIST recommends that within the United States "L" be used rather than "l".
* A plural of a symbol must not be used; e.g., 25&amp;nbsp;kg, not 25&amp;nbsp;{{Not a typo|kgs}}.
* Uppercase and lowercase prefixes are not interchangeable. E.g., the quantities 1&amp;nbsp;mW and 1&amp;nbsp;MW represent two different quantities (milliwatt and megawatt).
* The symbol for the [[decimal marker]] is either a [[full stop|point]] or [[comma]] on the line. In practice, the decimal point is used in most English-speaking countries and most of Asia, and the comma in most of [[Latin America]] and in continental [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|European countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=March–April 2008 |title=Period or Comma? Decimal Styles over Time and Place |url=http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/files/scienceeditor/v31n2p042-043.pdf |journal=Science Editor |volume=31 |issue=2 |page=42 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228062258/http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/files/scienceeditor/v31n2p042-043.pdf |archive-date=2013-02-28 |author-first=Amelia A. |author-last=Williamson |access-date=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spaces should be used as a [[thousands separator]] ({{val|1000000}}) in contrast to commas or periods (1,000,000 or 1.000.000) to reduce confusion resulting from the variation between these forms in different countries.
* Any line-break inside a number, inside a compound unit, or between number and unit should be avoided. Where this is not possible, line breaks should coincide with thousands separators.
* Since the value of "billion" and "trillion" can [[Long and short scales|vary from language to language]], the dimensionless terms "ppb" (parts per [[Billion (word)|billion]]) and "ppt" (parts per [[long and short scales|trillion]]) should be avoided. No alternative is suggested in the SI Brochure.

====Printing SI symbols====
The rules covering printing of quantities and units are part of ISO 80000-1:2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:80000:-1:ed-1:v1:en |title=ISO 80000-1:2009(en) Quantities and Units—Past 1:General |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |date=2009 |access-date=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further rules&lt;ref name="generalrules" group="Note"/&gt; are specified in respect of production of text using [[printing press]]es, [[word processor]]s, [[typewriter]]s and the like.

[[File:SI Brochure Cover.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of brochure ''[http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/ The International System of Units]'']]
The CGPM publishes a brochure that defines and presents the SI.&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"&gt;{{SIbrochure8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its official version is in French, in line with the [[Metre Convention]].&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|102}} It leaves some scope for local interpretation, particularly regarding names and terms in different languages.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For example, the United States' [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) has produced a version of the CGPM document (NIST SP 330) which clarifies local interpretation for English-language publications that use [[American English]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NIST330"&gt;{{Cite book |author-first1=Barry N. |author-last1=Taylor |author-first2=Ambler |author-last2=Thompson |title=The International System of Units (SI) (Special publication 330) |url=https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2016/12/07/sp330.pdf |access-date=2017-08-04 |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |location=Gaithersburg, MD |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantities and equations that provide the context in which the SI units are defined are now referred to as the ''[[International System of Quantities]]'' (ISQ).
The system is based on the [[Quantity#Quantity in physical science|quantities]] underlying each of the seven base units of the SI. Other quantities, such as [[area]], [[pressure]], and [[electrical resistance]], are derived from these base quantities by clear non-contradictory equations. The ISQ defines the quantities that are measured with the SI units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International vocabulary of metrology – Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM) |date=2012 |publisher=International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM): Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology |edition=3rd |chapter-url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2012.pdf |access-date=2015-03-28 |chapter=1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISQ is defined in the international standard [[ISO/IEC 80000]], and was finalised in 2009 with the publication of [[ISO 80000-1]].&lt;ref&gt;S.

Metrologists carefully distinguish between the definition of a unit and its realisation. The definition of each base unit of the SI is drawn up so that it is unique and provides a sound theoretical basis on which the most accurate and reproducible measurements can be made. The realisation of the definition of a unit is the procedure by which the definition may be used to establish the value and associated uncertainty of a quantity of the same kind as the unit. A description of the ''mise en pratique''&lt;ref group="Note" name="Translation"&gt;This term is a [[#Metre Convention|translation]] of the official [French] text of the SI Brochure.&lt;/ref&gt; of the base units is given in an electronic appendix to the SI Brochure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/si/new_si/mise-en-pratique.html |title=What is a mise en pratique? |publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] |access-date=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|168–169}}

The published ''mise en pratique'' is not the only way in which a base unit can be determined: the SI Brochure states that "any method consistent with the laws of physics could be used to realise any SI unit."&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|111}} In the current (2016) exercise to [[New SI definitions|overhaul the definitions of the base units]], various consultative committees of the CIPM have required that more than one ''mise en pratique'' shall be developed for determining the value of each unit.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In particular:
* At least three separate experiments be carried out yielding values having a relative standard uncertainty in the determination of the [[kilogram]] of no more than {{val|5|e=-8}} and at least one of these values should be better than {{val|2|e=-8}}. Both the [[Kibble balance]] and the [[Avogadro project]] should be included in the experiments and any differences between these be reconciled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/CCM12.pdf#page=23 |title=Recommendations of the Consultative Committee for Mass and Related Quantities to the International Committee for Weights and Measures |website=12th Meeting of the CCM |date=2010-03-26 |publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures |location=Sèvres |access-date=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/CCQM16.pdf#page=40 |title=Recommendations of the Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance – Metrology in Chemistry to the International Committee for Weights and Measures |website=16th Meeting of the CCQM

==Evolution of the SI==
===Changes to the SI===
The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) has described SI as "the modern metric system".&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|95}} Changing technology has led to an evolution of the definitions and standards that has followed two principal strands – changes to SI itself, and clarification of how to use units of measure that are not part of SI but are still nevertheless used on a worldwide basis.

Since 1960 the CGPM has made a number of changes to the SI to meet the needs of specific fields, notably chemistry and radiometry. These are mostly additions to the list of named derived units, and include the ''[[Mole (unit)|mole]]'' (symbol mol) for an amount of substance, the ''[[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]'' (symbol Pa) for [[pressure]], the ''[[Siemens (unit)|siemens]]'' (symbol S) for electrical conductance, the ''[[becquerel]]'' (symbol Bq) for "[[Radioactive decay|activity]] referred to a [[radionuclide]]", the ''[[Gray (unit)|gray]]'' (symbol Gy) for ionising radiation, the ''[[sievert]]'' (symbol Sv) as the unit of dose equivalent radiation, and the ''[[katal]]'' (symbol kat) for [[catalytic activity]].&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|156}}&lt;ref&gt;p. 221 – McGreevy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|156}}&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|158}}&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|159}}&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|165}}

Acknowledging the advancement of precision science at both large and small scales, the range of defined prefixes pico- (10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;) to tera- (10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) was extended to 10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|152}}&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|158}}&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|164}}

The 1960 definition of the standard metre in terms of wavelengths of a specific emission of the krypton 86 atom was replaced with the distance that light travels in a vacuum in exactly {{sfrac|{{val|299792458}}}} second, so that the speed of light is now an exactly specified constant of nature.

A few changes to notation conventions have also been made to alleviate lexicographic ambiguities. An analysis under the aegis of [[CSIRO]], published in 2009 by the [[Royal Society]], has pointed out the opportunities to finish the realisation of that goal, to the point of universal zero-ambiguity machine readability.&lt;ref name="Foster_2009"&gt;{{Citation |last=Foster |first=Marcus P. |year=2009 |title=Disambiguating the SI notation would guarantee its correct parsing |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society#Proceedings of the Royal Society A|Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] |volume=465 |issue= 2104|pages=1227–1229 |url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsa/465/2104/1227.full.pdf |doi=10.1098/rspa.2008.0343 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2019 redefinitions===
[[File:Relations between New SI units definitions.svg|thumb |right |Dependencies of SI units upon seven [[physical constant]]s, which are assigned numerical values. Unlike the previous definitions, the base units are all derived exclusively from constants of nature.]]
{{main|Redefinition of SI base units}}

After the [[History of the metre|metre was redefined]] in 1960, the kilogram remained the only SI base unit directly based on a specific physical artefact, the [[international prototype of the kilogram]] (IPK), for its definition and thus the only unit that was still subject to periodic comparisons of national standard kilograms with the IPK.&lt;ref name="NPL kg"&gt;{{cite web |title=Redefining the kilogram |url=http://www.npl.co.uk/educate-explore/redefining-the-kilogram/|publisher=UK National Physical Laboratory |access-date=2014-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2nd and 3rd Periodic Verification of National Prototypes of the Kilogram, a significant divergence had occurred between the mass of the IPK and all of its official copies stored around the world: the copies had all noticeably increased in mass with respect to the IPK. During ''extraordinary verifications'' carried out in 2014 preparatory to redefinition of metric standards, continuing divergence was not confirmed. Nonetheless, the residual and irreducible instability of a physical IPK undermined the reliability of the entire metric system to precision measurement from small (atomic) to large (astrophysical) scales.

A proposal was made that:
*In addition to the speed of light, four constants of nature – the [[Planck constant]], an [[elementary charge]], the [[Boltzmann constant]] and the [[Avogadro number]] – be defined to have exact values
*The International Prototype Kilogram be retired
*The current definitions of the kilogram, ampere, kelvin and mole be revised
*The wording of base unit definitions should change emphasis from explicit unit to explicit constant definitions.

The redefinitions were adopted at the 26th CGPM in November 2018, and will come into effect in May 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/cc/TGFC/Allowed/Minutes/CODATA_Minutes_14-BIPM-public.pdf |title=Report on the Meeting of the CODATA Task Group on Fundamental Constants |date=3–4 November 2014 |place=[[BIPM]] |author-first=B. |author-last=Wood |page=7 |quote=[BIPM director Martin] Milton responded to a question about what would happen if ... the CIPM or the CGPM voted not to move forward with the redefinition of the SI.

{{main|History of the metric system}}

===The improvisation of units===
The units and unit magnitudes of the metric system which became the SI were improvised piecemeal from everyday physical quantities starting in the mid-18th century. Only later were they moulded into an orthogonal coherent decimal system of measurement.

The degree centigrade as a unit of temperature resulted from the scale devised by Swedish astronomer [[Anders Celsius]] in 1742. His scale counter-intuitively designated 100 as the freezing point of water and 0 as the boiling point. Independently, in 1743, the French physicist [[Jean-Pierre Christin]] described a scale with 0 as the freezing point of water and 100 the boiling point. The scale became known as the centi-grade, or 100 gradations of temperature, scale.

The metric system was developed from 1791 onwards by a committee of the [[French Academy of Sciences]], commissioned to create a unified and rational system of measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/history-si/name_kg.html |title=The name 'kilogram' |publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] |access-date=2006-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514110300/http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/history-si/name_kg.html |archivedate=14 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group, which included preeminent French men of science,&lt;ref name="Alder"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Measure of all Things—The Seven-Year-Odyssey that Transformed the World |author-last=Alder |author-first=Ken |date=2002 |publisher=Abacus |location=London |isbn=978-0-349-11507-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|89}} used the same principles for relating length, volume, and mass that had been proposed by the English clergyman [[John Wilkins]] in 1668&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/from-artefacts-to-atoms-the-bipm-and-the-search-for-ultimate-measurement-standards/oclc/705716998/viewport |title=From artefacts to atoms: the BIPM and the search for ultimate measurement standards |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=2012 |page=xxvii |author-first=Terry |author-last=Quinn |quote=he [Wilkins] proposed essentially what became ... the French decimal metric system |isbn=978-0-19-530786-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=John Wilkins |author-first=John |author-last=Wilkins |date=1668 |title=An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language |chapter=VII |pages=190–194 |publisher=The Royal Society}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/WilkinsTranslationLong.pdf |title=Reproduction (33 MB) |access-date=2011-03-06}}; {{cite web |url=http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/WilkinsTranslationShort.pdf |access-date=2011-03-06 |title=Transcription}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the concept of using the Earth's [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] as the basis of the definition of length, originally proposed in 1670 by the French abbot [[Gabriel Mouton|Mouton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830903071.html |title=Mouton, Gabriel |website=Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography |date=2008 |publisher=[[encyclopedia.com]] |access-date=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mouton"&gt;{{MacTutor |title=Gabriel Mouton |id=Mouton |date=January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1791, the Assembly adopted the committee's proposed principles for the new decimal system of measure including the metre defined to be 1/10,000,000th of the length of the quadrant of earth's meridian passing through Paris, and authorised a survey to precisely establish the length of the meridian. In July 1792, the committee proposed the names ''[[metre]]'', ''[[are (unit)|are]]'', ''[[litre]]'' and ''[[grave (unit)|grave]]'' for the units of length, area, capacity, and mass, respectively. The committee also proposed that multiples and submultiples of these units were to be denoted by decimal-based prefixes such as ''centi'' for a hundredth and ''kilo'' for a thousand.&lt;ref name="Tavernor"&gt;{{cite book |title=Smoot's Ear: The Measure of Humanity |author-first=Robert |author-last=Tavernor |date=2007 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |isbn=978-0-300-12492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}}

Later, during the process of adoption of the metric system, the Latin ''[[gram]]me'' and ''[[kilogram]]me'', replaced the former provincial terms ''gravet'' (1/1000 ''grave'') and ''grave''. In June 1799, based on the results of the meridian survey, the standard ''[[mètre des Archives]]'' and ''[[kilogramme des Archives]]'' were deposited in the [[Archives nationales (France)|French National Archives]]. Subsequently, that year, the metric system was adopted by law in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Bigourdan |author-first=Guillaume |author-link=Guillaume Bigourdan |title=Le Système Métrique Des Poids Et Mesures: Son Établissement Et Sa Propagation Graduelle, Avec L'histoire Des Opérations Qui Ont Servi À Déterminer Le Mètre Et Le Kilogramme (facsimile edition) |language=French |trans-title=The Metric System of Weights and Measures: Its Establishment and its Successive Introduction, with the History of the Operations Used to Determine the Metre and the Kilogram |orig-year=1901 |date=2012 |publisher=Ulan Press |asin=B009JT8UZU |asin-tld=co.uk |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon ridiculed it, and in 1812, introduced a replacement system, the ''mesures usuelles'' or "customary measures" which restored many of the old units, but redefined in terms of the metric system.

During the first half of the 19th century there was little consistency in the choice of preferred multiples of the base units: typically the myriametre ({{val|10000}}&amp;nbsp;metres) was in widespread use in both France and parts of Germany, while the kilogram ({{val|1000}} grams) rather than the myriagram was used for mass.&lt;ref name="Europa1842"/&gt;

In 1832, the German [[mathematician]] [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], assisted by [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]], implicitly defined the second as a base unit when he quoted the Earth's magnetic field in terms of millimetres, grams, and seconds.&lt;ref name="SIHistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/si/history-si/ |title=Brief history of the SI |publisher=International Bureau of Weights and Measures |access-date=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, the strength of the Earth's magnetic field had only been described in [[Relative change and difference|relative term]]s. The technique used by Gauss was to equate the [[torque]] induced on a suspended magnet of known mass by the Earth's magnetic field with the torque induced on an equivalent system under gravity. The resultant calculations enabled him to assign dimensions based on mass, length and time to the magnetic field.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The strength of the earth's magnetic field was designated 1&amp;nbsp;G (gauss) at the surface ({{nowrap|1== 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;−1/2&lt;/sup&gt;⋅g&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/translations/gaussMagnetic.pdf |title=The intensity of the Earth's magnetic force reduced to absolute measurement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A candlepower as a unit of illuminance was originally defined by an 1860 English law as the light produced by a pure [[spermaceti]] candle weighing {{frac|1|6}} pound (76 grams) and burning at a specified rate. Spermaceti, a waxy substance found in the heads of sperm whales, was once used to make high-quality candles. At this time the French standard of light was based upon the illumination from a [[Carcel lamp|Carcel oil lamp]]. The unit was defined as that illumination emanating from a lamp burning pure [[rapeseed oil]] at a defined rate. It was accepted that ten standard candles were about equal to one Carcel lamp.

{{main|Metre Convention}}
A French-inspired initiative for international cooperation in [[metrology]] led to the signing in 1875 of the [[Metre Convention]], also called Treaty of the Metre, by 17 nations.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Argentina, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, France, German Empire, Italy, Peru, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Ottoman Empire, United States and Venezuela.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alder"/&gt;{{rp|353–354}} Initially the convention only covered standards for the metre and the kilogram. In 1921, the Metre Convention was extended to include all physical units, including the ampere and others thereby enabling the CGPM to address inconsistencies in the way that the metric system had been used.&lt;ref name="LordKelvin"&gt;{{cite book |title=Lord Kelvin, His Influence on Electrical Measurements and Units |author-first=Paul |author-last=Tunbridge |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bZUK624LZBMC&amp;pg=PR2 |pages=42–46 |isbn=978-0-86341-237-0 |publisher=Peter Pereginus Ltd |date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|96}}

One of each was selected at random to become the [[International prototype metre]] and [[International prototype kilogram]] that replaced the ''[[mètre des Archives]]'' and ''[[kilogramme des Archives]]'' respectively.

In the 1860s, [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (later Lord Kelvin) and others working under the auspices of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], built on Gauss' work and formalised the concept of a coherent system of units with base units and derived units christened the [[centimetre–gram–second system of units]] in 1874. The principle of coherence was successfully used to define a number of units of measure based on the CGS, including the [[erg]] for [[energy]], the [[dyne]] for [[force]], the [[barye]] for [[pressure]], the [[Poise (unit)|poise]] for [[dynamic viscosity]] and the [[Stokes (unit)|stokes]] for [[kinematic viscosity]].&lt;ref name="BIPMCentenary"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nOG0SxxEu64C&amp;pg=PA240 |page=12 |title=The International Bureau of Weights and Measures 1875–1975: NBS Special Publication 420 |date=1975-05-20 |editor-last1=Page

In 1879, the CIPM published recommendations for writing the symbols for length, area, volume and mass, but it was outside its domain to publish recommendations for other quantities. Beginning in about 1900, physicists who had been using the symbol "μ" (mu) for "micrometre" or "micron", "λ" (lambda) for "microlitre", and "γ" (gamma) for "microgram" started to use the symbols "μm", "μL" and "μg".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-first=Thomas |author-last=McGreevy |editor-first1=Peter |editor-last1=Cunningham |title=The Basis of Measurement: Volume 2 – Metrication and Current Practice |pages=222–224 |isbn=978-0-948251-84-9 |date=1997 |publisher=Pitcon Publishing (Chippenham) Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the close of the 19th century three different systems of units of measure existed for electrical measurements: a [[CGS-based system for electrostatic units]], also known as the Gaussian or ESU system, a [[CGS-based system for electromechanical units]] (EMU) and an International system based on units defined by the Metre Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Weights, Measures and Units |author-first=Donald |author-last=Fenna |at=International unit |isbn=978-0-19-860522-5 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; for electrical distribution systems. 
Attempts to resolve the electrical units in terms of length, mass, and time using [[dimensional analysis]] was beset with difficulties—the dimensions depended on whether one used the ESU or EMU systems.&lt;ref name="Maxwell2"&gt;{{cite book |title=A treatise on electricity and magnetism |volume=2 |author-first=J. C. |author-last=Maxwell |author-link= |date=1873 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |url=https://archive.org/stream/electricandmag02maxwrich |pages=242–245 |access-date=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This anomaly was resolved in 1901 when [[Giovanni Giorgi]] published a paper in which he advocated using a fourth base unit alongside the existing three base units. The fourth unit could be chosen to be [[electric current]], [[voltage]], or [[electrical resistance]].&lt;ref name="IECGiorgi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iec.ch/about/history/beginning/giovanni_giorgi.htm |title=Historical figures: Giovanni Giorgi |date=2011 |publisher=[[International Electrotechnical Commission]] |access-date=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electric current with named unit 'ampere' was chosen as the base unit, and the other electrical quantities derived from it according to the laws of physics. This became the foundation of the MKS system of units.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a number of non-coherent units of measure based on the gram/kilogram, centimetre/metre and second, such as the ''[[Pferdestärke]]'' (metric horsepower) for [[Power (physics)|power]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ptb.de/cms/fileadmin/internet/Themenrundgaenge/hueterin_der_einheiten/einheiten_d.pdf |title=Die gesetzlichen Einheiten in Deutschland |language=German |page=6 |trans-title=List of units of measure in Germany |publisher=[[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt]] (PTB) |access-date=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;''Pferd'' is [[German language|German]] for "horse" and ''Stärke'' is German for "strength" or "power". The Pferdestärke is the power needed to raise 75&amp;nbsp;kg against gravity at the rate of one metre per second. ({{nowrap|1=1 PS = 0.985 HP}}).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[darcy (unit)|darcy]] for [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmse.ed.ac.uk/MSE3/Topics/MSE-permeability.pdf |publisher=Materials Science and Engineering, Division of Engineering, The [[University of Edinburgh]] |title=Porous materials: Permeability |page=3 |website=Module Descriptor, Material Science, Materials 3 |date=2001 |access-date=2012-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602124630/http://www.cmse.ed.ac.uk/MSE3/Topics/MSE-permeability.pdf |archivedate=2 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Torr#Manometric units of pressure|millimetres of mercury]]" for [[Atmospheric pressure|barometric]] and [[blood pressure]] were developed or propagated, some of which incorporated [[standard gravity]] in their definitions.&lt;ref group = "Note"&gt;This constant is unreliable, because it varies over the surface of the earth.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the [[Second World War]], a number of different systems of measurement were in use throughout the world. Some of these systems were metric system variations; others were based on [[Systems of measurement|customary system]]s of measure, like the U.S customary system and Imperial system of the UK and British Empire.

===The ''Practical system of units''===
{{missing info|section|changeover centigrade→Kelvin and candlepower→candela|date=December 2017}}
In 1948, the 9th CGPM commissioned a study to assess the measurement needs of the scientific, technical, and educational communities and "to make recommendations for a single practical system of units of measurement, suitable for adoption by all countries adhering to the Metre Convention".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/9/6/|title=BIPM - Resolution 6 of the 9th CGPM|website=Bipm.org|accessdate=22 August 2017|date = 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; This working document was ''Practical system of units of measurement''. Based on this study, the 10th CGPM in 1954 defined an international system derived from six base units including units of temperature and optical radiation in addition to those for the MKS system mass, length, and time units and [[Giovanni Giorgi|Giorgi]]'s current unit. Six base units were recommended: the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, degree Kelvin, and candela.

The 9th CGPM also approved the first formal recommendation for the writing of symbols in the metric system when the basis of the rules as they are now known was laid down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/9/7/ |title=Resolution 7 of the 9th meeting of the CGPM (1948): Writing and printing of unit symbols and of numbers |access-date=2012-11-06 |publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rules were subsequently extended and now cover unit symbols and names, prefix symbols and names, how quantity symbols should be written and used and how the values of quantities should be expressed.&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|104,130}}

In 1960, the 11th CGPM synthesised the results of the 12-year study into a set of 16 resolutions. The system was named the ''International System of Units'', abbreviated SI from the French name, {{lang|fr|Le Système International d'Unités}}.&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|110}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/11/12/|title=BIPM - Resolution 12 of the 11th CGPM|website=Bipm.org|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Functions}}
{{Distinguish|Multiplicative inverse}}
In [[mathematics]], an '''inverse function''' (or '''anti-function'''&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt;) is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that "reverses" another function: if the function {{mvar|f}} applied to an input {{mvar|x}} gives a result of {{mvar|y}}, then applying its inverse function {{mvar|g}} to {{mvar|y}} gives the result {{mvar|x}}, and vice versa, i.e., {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''y''}} [[if and only if]] {{math|1=''g''(''y'') = ''x''}}.&lt;ref name="Keisler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheinerman_2013"/&gt;

As an example, consider the real-valued function of a real variable given by {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = 5''x'' − 7}}. Thinking of this as a step-by-step procedure (namely, take a number {{mvar|x}}, multiply it by 5, then subtract 7 from the result), to reverse this and get {{mvar|x}} back from some output value, say {{mvar|y}}, we should undo each step in reverse order. In this case that means that we should add 7 to {{mvar|y}} and then divide the result by 5. In functional notation this inverse function would be given by,
:&lt;math&gt;g(y) = \frac{y + 7}{5}.&lt;/math&gt;
With {{math|1=''y'' = 5''x'' − 7}} we have that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''y''}} and {{math|1=''g''(''y'') = ''x''}}.

Not all functions have inverse functions. In order for a function {{math|''f'': ''X'' → ''Y''}} to have an inverse,&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB1"/&gt; it must have the property that [[for every]] {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|Y}} there must be [[uniqueness quantification|one, and only one]] {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|X}} so that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''y''}}. This property ensures that a function {{math|''g'': ''Y'' → ''X''}} will exist having the necessary relationship with {{mvar|f}}.

==Definitions==
[[Image:Inverse Functions Domain and Range.png|thumb|right|240px|If {{mvar|f}} maps {{mvar|X}} to {{mvar|Y}}, then {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}} maps {{mvar|Y}} back to {{mvar|X}}.]]

Let {{mvar|f}} be a function whose [[domain of a function|domain]] is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{mvar|X}}, and whose [[Range (mathematics)|image (range)]] is the set {{mvar|Y}}. Then {{mvar|f}} is ''invertible'' if there exists a function {{mvar|g}} with domain {{mvar|Y}} and image {{mvar|X}}, with the property:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = y\,\,\Leftrightarrow\,\,g(y) = x.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{mvar|f}} is invertible, the function {{mvar|g}} is [[unique (mathematics)|unique]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|2004|loc=p. 101, Theorem 4.5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that there is exactly one function {{mvar|g}} satisfying this property (no more, no less). That function {{mvar|g}} is then called ''the'' inverse of {{mvar|f}}, and is usually denoted as {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB2"/&gt;

Stated otherwise, a function, considered as a [[binary relation]], has an inverse if and only if the [[converse relation]] is a function on the range {{mvar|Y}}, in which case the converse relation is the inverse function.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Eggen|St. Andre|2006|loc=p. 202, Theorem 4.9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all functions have an inverse. For a function to have an inverse, each element {{math|''y'' ∈ ''Y''}} must correspond to no more than one {{math|''x'' ∈ ''X''}}; a function {{mvar|f}} with this property is called one-to-one or an [[injective function|injection]]. If {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is to be a [[function (mathematics)|function]] on {{mvar|Y}}, then each element {{math|''y'' ∈ ''Y''}} must correspond to some {{math|''x'' ∈ ''X''}}. Functions with this property are called [[surjective function|surjections]]. This property is satisfied by definition if {{mvar|Y}} is the image (range) of {{mvar|f}}, but may not hold in a more general context. To be invertible a function must be both an injection and a surjection. Such functions are called [[bijections]]. The inverse of an injection {{math| ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y''}} that is not a bijection, that is, a function that is not a surjection, is only a [[partial function]] on {{mvar|Y}}, which means that for some {{math|''y'' ∈ ''Y''}}, {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;(''y'')}} is undefined. If a function {{mvar|f}} is invertible, then both it and its inverse function {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} are bijections.

There is another convention used in the definition of functions. This can be referred to as the "set-theoretic" or "graph" definition using [[ordered pair]]s in which a [[codomain]] is never referred to.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1998|loc=p.198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this convention all functions are surjections,&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB3"/&gt; and so, being a bijection simply means being an injection. Authors using this convention may use the phrasing that a function is invertible if and only if it is an injection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|Patty|1988|loc=p. 116 Theorem 5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two conventions need not cause confusion as long as it is remembered that in this alternate convention the codomain of a function is always taken to be the range of the function.

===Example: Squaring and square root functions===
The function {{math|''f'': ℝ → [0,∞)}} given by {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is not injective since each possible result ''y'' (except 0) corresponds to two different starting points in {{mvar|X}} – one positive and one negative, and so this function is not invertible. With this type of function it is impossible to deduce an input from its output. Such a function is called non-[[Injective function|injective]] or, in some applications, information-losing.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

If the domain of the function is restricted to the nonnegative reals, that is, the function is redefined to be {{math|''f'': [0, ∞) → [0, ∞)}} with the same ''rule'' as before, then the function is bijective and so, invertible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lay|2006|loc=p.69 Example 7.24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inverse function here is called the ''(positive) square root function''.
&lt;!-- Repetitive. To be held for a short time until refactor is finished. 
===Inverses in higher mathematics===
The definition given above is commonly adopted in [[set theory]] and [[calculus]]. In higher mathematics, the notation
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon X \to Y &lt;/math&gt;
means "{{mvar|f}} is a function mapping elements of a set {{mvar|X}} to elements of a set {{mvar|Y }}".  The source, {{mvar|X}}, is called the domain of {{mvar|f}}, and the target, {{mvar|Y}}, is called the [[codomain]].  The codomain contains the range of {{mvar|f}} as a [[subset]], and is part of the definition of {{mvar|f}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Eggen|St. Andre|2006|loc=p. 179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When using codomains, the inverse of a function {{math| ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y''}} is required to have domain {{mvar|Y}} and codomain {{mvar|X}}.  For the inverse to be defined on all of {{mvar|Y}}, every element of {{mvar|Y}} must lie in the range of the function {{mvar|f}}.  A function with this property is called ''onto'' or ''[[Surjective function|surjective]]''.  Thus, a function with a codomain is invertible if and only if it is both ''[[Injective function|injective]]'' (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).  Such a function is called a one-to-one correspondence or a [[bijection]], and has the property that every element {{math| ''y'' ∈ ''Y''}} corresponds to exactly one element {{math| ''x'' ∈ ''X''}}.
--&gt;

==={{anchor|Compositional inverse}}Inverses and composition===
{{See also|Inverse element}}

If {{mvar|f}} is an invertible function with domain {{mvar|X}} and range {{mvar|Y}}, then

:&lt;math&gt; f^{-1}\left( \, f(x) \, \right) = x&lt;/math&gt;, for every &lt;math&gt;x \in X. &lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[composition of functions]] we can rewrite this statement as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; f^{-1} \circ f = \operatorname{id}_X, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|id&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[identity function]] on the set {{mvar|X}}; that is, the function that leaves its argument unchanged. In [[category theory]], this statement is used as the definition of an inverse [[morphism]].

Considering function composition helps to understand the notation {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Repeatedly composing a function with itself is called [[iterated function|iteration]]. If {{mvar|f}} is applied {{mvar|n}} times, starting with the value {{mvar|x}}, then this is written as {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}; so {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''f'' (''f'' (''x''))}}, etc. Since {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;(''f'' (''x'')) {{=}} ''x''}}, composing {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} yields {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, "undoing" the effect of one application of {{mvar|f}}.

===Note on notation===

While the notation {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} might be misunderstood, {{math|(''f''(''x''))&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} certainly denotes the [[multiplicative inverse]] of {{math|''f''(''x'')}} and has nothing to do with the inverse function of {{mvar|f}}.

In keeping with the general notation, some English&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt; authors use expressions like {{math|sin&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} to denote the inverse of the sine function applied to {{mvar|x}} (actually a [[#Partial inverses|partial inverse]]; see below)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1972|loc=pp. 304-309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors feel that this may be confused with the notation for the multiplicative inverse of {{math|sin (''x'')}}, which can be denoted as {{math|(sin (''x''))&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. To avoid any confusion, an [[inverse trigonometric function]] is often indicated by the prefix "[[arc (function prefix)|arc]]" (for Latin ''arcus'').&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korn_2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlas_2009"/&gt; For instance, the inverse of the sine function is typically called the [[arcsine]] function, written as {{math|[[arcsin]](''x'')}}.&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korn_2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlas_2009"/&gt; Similarly, the inverse of a [[hyperbolic function]] is indicated by the prefix "[[ar (function prefix)|ar]]" (for Latin ''area'').&lt;ref name="Atlas_2009"/&gt; For instance, the inverse of the [[hyperbolic sine]] function is typically written as {{math|[[arsinh]](''x'')}}.&lt;ref name="Atlas_2009"/&gt; Other inverse special functions are sometimes prefixed with the prefix "inv" if the ambiguity of the {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}} notation should be avoided.&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlas_2009"/&gt;

==Properties==
Since a function is a special type of [[binary relation]], many of the properties of an inverse function correspond to properties of [[converse relation]]s.

===Uniqueness===
If an inverse function exists for a given function {{mvar|f}}, then it is unique.&lt;ref name="Wolf72"&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1998|loc=p. 208 Theorem 7.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This follows since the inverse function must be the converse relation which is completely determined by {{mvar|f}}.

===Symmetry===
There is a symmetry between a function and its inverse. Specifically, if {{mvar|f}} is an invertible function with domain {{mvar|X}} and range {{mvar|Y}}, then its inverse {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}} has domain {{mvar|Y}} and range {{mvar|X}}, and the inverse of {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the original function {{mvar|f}}. In symbols, for functions {{math|''f'':''X'' → ''Y''}}  and {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;:''Y'' → ''X''}},&lt;ref name=Wolf72 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\circ f = \operatorname{id}_X &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f \circ f^{-1} = \operatorname{id}_Y.&lt;/math&gt;

This statement is a consequence of the implication that for {{mvar|f}} to be invertible it must be bijective. The [[involution (mathematics)|involutory]] nature of the inverse can be concisely expressed by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Eggen|St. Andre|2006|loc=pg. 141 Theorem 3.3(a)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\left(f^{-1}\right)^{-1} = f.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Composition of Inverses.png|thumb|right|240px|The inverse of {{math| ''g'' ∘ ''f'' }} is {{math| ''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt; ∘ ''g''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.]]
The inverse of a composition of functions is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lay|2006|loc=p. 71 Theorem 7.26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;(g \circ f)^{-1} = f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that the order of {{mvar|g}} and {{mvar|f}} have been reversed; to undo {{mvar|f}} followed by {{mvar|g}}, we must first undo {{mvar|g}} and then undo {{mvar|f}}.

For example, let {{math|1= ''f''(''x'') = 3''x''}} and let {{math|1= ''g''(''x'') = ''x'' + 5}}.  Then the composition {{math| ''g'' ∘ ''f''}} is the function that first multiplies by three and then adds five,
:&lt;math&gt;(g \circ f)(x) = 3x + 5.&lt;/math&gt;
To reverse this process, we must first subtract five, and then divide by three,
:&lt;math&gt;(g \circ f)^{-1}(x) = \tfrac13(x - 5).&lt;/math&gt;
This is the composition
{{math| (''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt; ∘ ''g''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;)(''x'')}}.

===Self-inverses===
If {{mvar|X}} is a set, then the [[identity function]] on {{mvar|X}} is its own inverse:

:&lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{id}_X}^{-1} = \operatorname{id}_X.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, a function {{math| ''f'' : ''X'' → ''X''}} is equal to its own inverse if and only if the composition {{math| ''f'' ∘ ''f''}} is equal to {{math|id&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Such a function is called an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]].

==Inverses in calculus==
Single-variable [[calculus]] is primarily concerned with functions that map [[real number]]s to real numbers. Such functions are often defined through [[formula]]s, such as:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = (2x + 8)^3 .&lt;/math&gt;
A surjective function {{mvar|f}} from the real numbers to the real numbers possesses an inverse as long as it is one-to-one, i.e. as long as the graph of {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} has, for each possible {{mvar|y}} value only one corresponding {{mvar|x}} value, and thus passes the [[horizontal line test]].

The following table shows several standard functions and their inverses:

===Formula for the inverse===
One approach to finding a formula for {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, if it exists, is to solve the [[equation]] {{math|1= ''y'' = ''f''(''x'') }} for {{mvar|x}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|2004|loc=p. 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if {{mvar|f}} is the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = (2x + 8)^3 &lt;/math&gt;

then we must solve the equation {{math|1= ''y'' = (2''x'' + 8)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} for {{mvar|x}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      y         &amp; = (2x+8)^3 \\
  \sqrt[3]{y}   &amp; = 2x + 8   \\
\sqrt[3]{y} - 8 &amp; = 2x       \\
\dfrac{\sqrt[3]{y} - 8}{2} &amp; = x .
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the inverse function {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y) = \frac{\sqrt[3]{y} - 8} 2.&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes the inverse of a function cannot be expressed by a formula with a finite number of terms.  For example, if {{mvar|f}} is the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x - \sin x ,&lt;/math&gt;

then {{mvar|f}} is a bijection, and therefore possesses an inverse function {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  The [[Kepler's equation#Inverse Kepler equation|formula for this inverse]] has an infinite number of terms:

:&lt;math&gt; f^{-1}(y) =
\sum_{n=1}^\infty
 \frac{y^{n/3}}{n!} \lim_{ \theta \to 0} \left(
 \frac{\mathrm{d}^{\,n-1}}{\mathrm{d} \theta^{\,n-1}} \left(
 \frac \theta { \sqrt[3]{ \theta - \sin( \theta )} } \right)^n
\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

===Graph of the inverse===
[[Image:Inverse Function Graph.png|thumb|right|The graphs of {{math|1= ''y'' = ''f''(''x'') }} and {{math|1= ''y'' = ''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}. The dotted line is {{math|1= ''y'' = ''x''}}.]]
If  {{mvar|f}} is invertible, then the graph of the function

:&lt;math&gt;y = f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

is the same as the graph of the equation

:&lt;math&gt;x = f(y) .&lt;/math&gt;

This is identical to the equation {{math|1= ''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} that defines the graph of {{mvar|f}}, except that the roles of {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} have been reversed.  Thus the graph of {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be obtained from the graph of {{mvar|f}} by switching the positions of the {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} axes.  This is equivalent to [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflecting]] the graph across the line
{{math|1= ''y'' = ''x''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Briggs|Cochran|2011|loc=pp. 28-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inverses and derivatives===
A [[continuous function]] {{mvar|f}} is invertible on its range (image) if and only if it is either strictly [[monotonic function|increasing or decreasing]] (with no local [[maxima and minima|maxima or minima]]).  For example, the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^3 + x&lt;/math&gt;

is invertible, since the [[derivative]]
{{math|1= ''f&amp;prime;''(''x'') = 3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 }} is always positive.

If the function {{mvar|f}} is [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] on an interval {{mvar|I}} and {{math| ''f&amp;prime;''(''x'') ≠ 0}} for each {{math|''x'' ∈ ''I''}}, then the inverse {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}} will be differentiable on {{math|''f''(''I'')}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lay|2006|loc=p. 246 Theorem 26.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If {{math|1= ''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}}, the derivative of the inverse is given by the [[inverse function theorem]],
:&lt;math&gt;\left(f^{-1}\right)^\prime (y)  = \frac{1}{f'\left(x \right)}. &lt;/math&gt;
Using [[Leibniz's notation]] the formula above can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dy} = \frac{1}{dy / dx}. &lt;/math&gt;
This result follows from the [[chain rule]] (see the article on [[inverse functions and differentiation]]).

The inverse function theorem can be generalized to functions of several variables.  Specifically, a differentiable [[real multivariable function|multivariable function]] {{math| ''f '': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is invertible in a neighborhood of a point {{mvar|p}} as long as the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian matrix]] of {{mvar|f}} at {{mvar|p}} is [[invertible matrix|invertible]].  In this case, the Jacobian of {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}} at {{math|''f''(''p'')}} is the [[matrix inverse]] of the Jacobian of {{mvar|f}} at {{mvar|p}}.

== Real-world examples ==
* Let {{mvar|f}} be the function that converts a temperature in degrees [[Celsius]] to a temperature in degrees [[Fahrenheit]],
::&lt;math&gt; F = f(C) = \tfrac95 C + 32 ;&lt;/math&gt;
:then its inverse function converts degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius,
::&lt;math&gt; C = f^{-1}(F) = \tfrac59 (F - 32) ,&lt;/math&gt;
:since
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f^{-1} (f(C)) = {} &amp; f^{-1}\left(  \tfrac95 C + 32 \right) = \tfrac59 \left( (\tfrac95 C + 32 ) - 32 \right) =  C, \\
&amp; \text{for every value of } C, \text{ and } \\[6pt]
f\left(f^{-1}(F)\right) = {} &amp; f\left(\tfrac59 (F - 32)\right) = \tfrac95 \left(\tfrac59 (F - 32)\right) + 32 = F, \\
&amp; \text{for every value of } F.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

* Suppose {{mvar|f}} assigns each child in a family its birth year. An inverse function would output which child was born in a given year. However, if the family children born in the same year (for instance, twins or triplets, etc.) then the output cannot be known when the input is the common birth year. As well, if a year is given in which no child was born then a child cannot be named. But if each child was born in a separate year, and if we restrict attention to the three years in which a child was born, then we do have an inverse function. For example,
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 f(\text{Allan})&amp;=2005 , \quad &amp; f(\text{Brad})&amp;=2007 , \quad &amp; f(\text{Cary})&amp;=2001 \\
 f^{-1}(2005)&amp;=\text{Allan} , \quad &amp; f^{-1}(2007)&amp;=\text{Brad} , \quad &amp; f^{-1}(2001)&amp;=\text{Cary}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

* Let {{mvar|R}} be the function that leads to an {{mvar|x}} percentage rise of some quantity, and {{mvar|F}} be the function producing an {{mvar|x}} percentage fall. Applied to $100 with {{mvar|x}} = 10%, we find that applying the first function followed by the second does not restore the original value of $100, demonstrating the fact that, despite appearances, these two functions are not inverses of each other.

==Generalizations==

===Partial inverses===
[[Image:Inverse square graph.svg|thumb|right|The square root of {{mvar|x}} is a partial inverse to {{math|1= ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.]]
Even if a function {{mvar|f}} is not one-to-one, it may be possible to define a '''partial inverse''' of {{mvar|f}} by [[Function (mathematics)#Restrictions and extensions|restricting]] the domain.  For example, the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2&lt;/math&gt;

is not one-to-one, since {{math|1= ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (−''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  However, the function becomes one-to-one if we restrict to the domain {{math| ''x'' ≥ 0}}, in which case

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y) = \sqrt{y} . &lt;/math&gt;

(If we instead restrict to the domain {{math| ''x'' ≤ 0}}, then the inverse is the negative of the square root of {{mvar|y}}.)  Alternatively, there is no need to restrict the domain if we are content with the inverse being a [[multivalued function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y) = \pm\sqrt{y} . &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Inversa d'una cúbica gràfica.png|right|thumb|The inverse of this [[cubic function]] has three branches.]]
Sometimes this multivalued inverse is called the '''full inverse''' of {{mvar|f}}, and the portions (such as {{sqrt|{{mvar|x}}}} and −{{sqrt|{{mvar|x}}}}) are called ''branches''.  The most important branch of a multivalued function (e.g. the positive square root) is called the ''[[principal branch]]'', and its value at {{mvar|y}} is called the ''principal value'' of {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;(''y'')}}.

For a continuous function on the real line, one branch is required between each pair of [[minima and maxima|local extrema]].  For example, the inverse of a [[cubic function]] with a local maximum and a local minimum has three branches (see the adjacent picture).

[[Image:Gràfica del arcsinus.png|right|thumb|The [[arcsine]] is a partial inverse of the [[sine]] function.]]
These considerations are particularly important for defining the inverses of [[trigonometric functions]].  For example, the [[sine function]] is not one-to-one, since

:&lt;math&gt;\sin(x + 2\pi) = \sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for every real {{mvar|x}} (and more generally {{math|1= sin(''x'' + 2{{pi}}''n'') = sin(''x'')}} for every [[integer]] {{mvar|n}}).  However, the sine is one-to-one on the interval
{{closed-closed|−{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}}}, and the corresponding partial inverse is called the [[arcsine]].  This is considered the principal branch of the inverse sine, so the principal value of the inverse sine is always between −{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} and {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}.  The following table describes the principal branch of each inverse trigonometric function:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Briggs|Cochran|2011|loc=pp. 39-42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Left and right inverses===
If {{math|''f'': ''X'' → ''Y''}}, a '''left inverse''' for {{mvar|f}} (or ''[[retract (category theory)|retraction]]'' of {{mvar|f}} ) is a function {{math| ''g'': ''Y'' → ''X''}} such that

: &lt;math&gt;g \circ f = \operatorname{id}_X . &lt;/math&gt;

That is, the function {{mvar|g}} satisfies the rule

: &lt;math&gt;\text{If } f(x) = y, \text{ then } g(y) = x .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, {{mvar|g}} must equal the inverse of {{mvar|f}} on the image of {{mvar|f}}, but may take any values for elements of {{mvar|Y}} not in the image. A function {{mvar|f}} with a left inverse is necessarily injective. In classical mathematics, every injective function {{mvar|f}} with a nonempty domain necessarily has a left inverse; however, this may fail in [[constructive mathematics]]. For instance, a left inverse of the inclusion {{math|{0,1} → '''R'''}} of the two-element set in the reals violates [[indecomposability]] by giving a [[Retract (category theory)|retraction]] of the real line to the set {{math|{0,1} }}.

A '''right inverse''' for {{mvar|f}} (or ''[[section (category theory)|section]]'' of {{mvar|f}} ) is a function {{math| ''h'': ''Y'' → ''X''}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;f \circ h = \operatorname{id}_Y . &lt;/math&gt;

That is, the function {{mvar|h}} satisfies the rule

:If &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle h(y) = x&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f(x) = y .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, {{math|''h''(''y'')}} may be any of the elements of {{mvar|X}} that map to {{mvar|y}} under {{mvar|f}}.  A function {{mvar|f}} has a right inverse if and only if it is surjective (though constructing such an inverse in general requires the [[axiom of choice]]).

An inverse which is both a left and right inverse must be unique. However, if {{mvar|g}} is a left inverse for {{mvar|f}}, then {{mvar|g}} may or may not be a right inverse for {{mvar|f}}; and if {{mvar|g}} is a right inverse for {{mvar|f}}, then {{mvar|g}} is not necessarily a left inverse for {{mvar|f}}. For example, let {{math|''f'': '''R''' &amp;rarr; {{closed-open|0, ∞}}}} denote the squaring map, such that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|'''R'''}}, and let  {{math|{{mvar|g}}: {{closed-open|0, ∞}} &amp;rarr; '''R'''}} denote the square root map, such that {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} }}{{radic|{{mvar|x}}}} for all {{math|''x'' ≥ 0}}. Then {{math|1=''f''(''g''(''x'')) = ''x''}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{closed-open|0, ∞}}; that is, {{mvar|g}} is a right inverse to {{mvar|f}}. However, {{mvar|g}} is not a left inverse to {{mvar|f}}, since, e.g., {{math|1=''g''(''f''(−1)) = 1 ≠ −1}}.

===Preimages===
If {{math|''f'': ''X'' → ''Y''}} is any function (not necessarily invertible), the '''preimage''' (or '''inverse image''') of an element {{math| ''y'' &amp;isin; ''Y''}} is the set of all elements of {{mvar|X}} that map to {{mvar|y}}:

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(\{y\}) = \left\{ x\in X : f(x) = y \right\} . &lt;/math&gt;

The preimage of {{mvar|y}} can be thought of as the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of {{mvar|y}} under the (multivalued) full inverse of the function {{mvar|f}}.

Similarly, if {{mvar|S}} is any [[subset]] of {{mvar|Y}}, the preimage of {{mvar|S}} is the set of all elements of {{mvar|X}} that map to {{mvar|S}}:

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(S) = \left\{ x\in X : f(x) \in S \right\} . &lt;/math&gt;

For example, take a function {{math|''f'': '''R''' → '''R'''}}, where {{math|''f'': ''x'' ↦ ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This function is not invertible for reasons discussed [[#Example: squaring and square root functions|above]]. Yet preimages may be defined for subsets of the codomain:

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(\left\{1,4,9,16\right\}) = \left\{-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The preimage of a single element {{math| ''y'' &amp;isin; ''Y''}} – a [[singleton set]] {{math|{''y''} }} – is sometimes called the ''[[fiber (mathematics)|fiber]]'' of {{mvar|y}}.  When {{mvar|Y}} is the set of real numbers, it is common to refer to {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;({''y''})}} as a ''[[level set]]''.

'''Jennifer Des''' (born 1975) is a Belgian photographer.

==Style==
She is inspired by [[Francis Bacon (artist)]] in the treatment of the human corpse by manipulating images of [[plastic surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.younggalleryphoto.com/photography/des/des.html The mutilated corpses]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Brussels]], she studied at the '''École de recherche graphique''' in her hometown. She put into practice her studies in [[Kinshasa]] where she worked for six months for the [[French Community of Belgium]].  She had her first individual  exhibition in 2003 at the ''galerie Pascal Polar'' in Brussels. She was selected for the collective exhibition ''175 years of Belgium'' by the Belgian Photography Museum and at the ''Espace Blanche'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espaceblanche.be/crbst_84.html Espace Blanche]&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Frédéric Beigbeder]] as her mentor. She exposed with [[Wim Delvoye]] and [[Delphine Boël]] at the Salle des Beaux Arts du [[Sablon (Brussels)|Sablon]] for the ''[[Pierre Bergé]] – [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] Foundation'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://be.linkedin.com/pub/philippe-lichtfus/20/980/254 Concept Interview with Philippe Lichtfus]&lt;/ref&gt;  She made in 2009 an exhibition ''Les Sangtiments'' at the ''Young Gallery'' with her human body work from pictures made (with special admission) from parts of the human body found in the clinic rooms of hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lesphotographes.com/interviews/jennifer-des-expose-ses-sangtiments Young Galery ]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012  she had her exposition in the SohoPhoto Gallery in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sohophoto.com/exhibitions/archive/december-2012-exhibitions SohoPhoto Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt;
Now Jennifer Des is working on the high-definition photography of the personalized [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] on a [[cosmos|cosmic]] background for the EYE-D project exhibited at the ''Mercedes House'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercedeshouse.be/fr/event/mercedes-house-concerts  Mercedes House concerts p.6]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011, at the ''Top Marques'' in [[Monaco]] in 2014 and at the ''Café de Paris'' in [[Monte Carlo]] March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Monaco Hebdo, 5 March Number 915, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015 at the Park Lenôtre [[Mougins]] with [[Robert Hossein]] and [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://comtesse-tatiana.com/mecenat-prix/#asso Comtesse Tatiana]&lt;/ref&gt;  Invités d'Honneurs.
She had an exposition in March 2016 in the Dark Room Galerie &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkroomgalerie.fr Dark Room Galerie]&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Irina Brook]] and [[Soulwax]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.tribuca.legal/online/2016/10/834/#/30 Tribune Bulletin côte d'azur]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelriviera.com/cr2/ Channel Riviera]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelriviera.com/cr2/Article/5291/Darkroom_Galerie_un_regard_sur_la_Vie_un_clin_d_%c5%93il_a_l_Eternite Channel Riviera Web TV]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&amp;v=wwskb3W7Ah8 Galerie Dark Room Vernissage]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiochalomnitsan.com/upload/podcasts/audios/570505fac7d183.64622224.mp3 Radio explication du concept EYE-D]&lt;/ref&gt;

==EYE-D Project: Retinal imprint==
Jennifer Des creates each of her pieces in relation to the model and the request. In addition to its retinal imprint, the stellar presence highlights the dominant planets.
With the help of a professional astrologer, an astral map is made.  Jennifer Des gets her inspiration from this to add extra material to her art. She then integrates it to the eye imprint.  Her clients can also have their own portrait, as well as a portrait with their family member's eyes. Human eyes, just like DNA or fingerprints define our unique identity.&lt;ref&gt;Connexions des Arts, numéro 9, Printemps 2016, p. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://galerieoscar.com Galerie Oscar]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabsconnexions.com Site de Connexion des Arts] &lt;/ref&gt;

==ETERNITY Vision: a new universal and individual perception of astral proportions==
Jennifer Des redefines her subject's individuality as a planetary center of new cosmic dimensions ready for eternity. As she shot the eyes of her mother, she discovered a new meaning to eternity and what this could represent for us.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meta.mc Meta Monte Carlo] &lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer had an expostion at the Gallery Riccadonna Rue Grimaldi in Monaco on the 5th of July with her recent works. &lt;ref&gt;[https://monacomadame.org/2018/07/09/eternity-vision/ Monaco Madame]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kanun''' is a set of traditional [[Albania]]n laws. The Kanun was primarily oral and only in the 20th century was it published in writing.&lt;ref name="Co22"&gt;{{cite book| last = Cook| first = Bernard| title = Europe since 1945 an encyclopedia| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ox_gXq2jpdYC&amp;pg=PA22| accessdate = 2010-07-01| year = 2001| publisher = Garland Publishing| isbn = 0-8153-4057-5| page = 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kanun of [[Lekë Dukagjini]] ({{lang|sq|Kanuni i Lekë Dukagjinit}}) was codified in the 15th century.  Six later variations eventually evolved:
*The Old Kanun ({{lang-sq|Kanun i vjetër}});
*The Kanun of [[Mirdita]] ({{lang-sq|Kanuni i Mirditës}});
*The Kanun of [[Pukë]] ({{lang-sq|Kanuni i Pukës}});
*The Kanun of [[Çermenikë]] ({{lang-sq|Kanuni i Çermenikës}});
*The Kanun of Pope Julius ({{lang-sq|Kanuni i Papa Zhulit}});
*The Kanun of [[Labëria]] ({{lang-sq|Kanuni i Labërisë}});&lt;ref&gt;R. Zojzi The Code of Labëria ({{lang-sq|"Kanuni i Labërisë" Tirana}} (Institute of Folk Culture Archives&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Kanun of [[Skanderbeg]] ({{lang-sq|Kanuni i Skënderbeut}})&lt;ref&gt;Ilia, I.F. Kanuni i Skenderbegut (1993) The Code of Skanderbeg Shkoder Publisher:Archbishop of Shkodra.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Young| first = Antonia| title = Women Who Become Men Albanian Sworn Virgins| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jDgqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA732| year = 2000| publisher = Bloomsbury Academic| isbn = 978-1-85973-340-0| page = 732 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as The Kanun of Arbëria ({{lang-sq|Kanuni i Arbërisë}}).

The Kanun of Skanderbeg is the closest in similarity with the Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini, and the latter is usually the most known and is also regarded as a synonym of the word ''kanun''. The Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini was developed by Lekë Dukagjini, who codified the existing customary laws.&lt;ref name="Gawrych30"/&gt; It has been used mostly in northern and central [[Albania]] and surrounding areas formerly in Yugoslavia where there is a large [[ethnic Albanian]] population; [[Montenegro]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. It was first codified in the 15th century but the use of it has been outspread much earlier in time. It was used under that form until the 20th century, and revived recently after the fall of the [[History of Communist Albania|communist regime]] in the early 1990s.

==Etymology==
The term ''kanun'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "{{lang|el|κανών}}" ("canon"), meaning amongst others "pole" or "rule"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkanw%2Fn κανών], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and was transported from Greek to Arabic and then into early Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Marii͡a Nikolaeva Todorova| title = Balkan Identities Nation and Memory| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4EVGvQNFD7gC&amp;pg=PA111| year = 2004| publisher = NYU Press| isbn = 978-0-8147-8279-8| page = 111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kanun was also known by the word of ''Doke''.

== Origin ==
The practice of the oral laws that [[Lekë Dukagjini]] codified in the Kanun was suggested by [[Edith Durham]] as dating back to the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref name="kolor"&gt;{{cite book| last = Foyer-Merib| first = the| title = Kolor. Journal on moving communities| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SZqcmmn2YsgC&amp;pg=PA10| year = 2006| publisher = Garant| isbn = 90-441-2008-5| page = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have conjectured that the Kanun may derive from ancient Illyrian tribal laws.&lt;ref&gt;Dukagjini, L., Gjecov, S., Fox, L. ''Kanuni i Lekë Dukagjinit''. Gjonlekaj Publishing Co., 1989. p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have suggested that the Kanun has retained elements from Indo-European prehistoric eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Cancik| first1 = Hubert| last2 = Schneider| first2 = Helmuth| title = Brill's New Pauly Encyclopaedia of the Ancient World. Classical Tradition| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UqE5SwAACAAJ| year = 2002| publisher = Brill| isbn = 90-04-14221-5| page = 92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However several stratifications can be easily observed in the code, beginning with pre-Indo-European, Indo-European, Ancient Greek, Roman, general Balkan and Osmanli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Sellers| first1 = Mortimer| last2 = Tomaszewski| first2 = Tadeusz| title = The Rule of Law in Comparative Perspective| year = 2010| publisher = Springer Verlag| isbn = 978-90-481-3748-0| page = 205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Serbian authors T. O. Oraovac&lt;ref&gt;T. O. Oraovac, Albansko pitanje i srpsko pravo, Beograd, 1913, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; and S. S. Djuric, it is largely based on [[Dušan's Code]], the constitution of the [[Serbian Empire]] (enacted 1349), which at the time [[Albania under the Serbian Empire|held the whole of Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Wilhelm-Stempin| first = Nikolaus| title = Das albanische Gewohnheitsrecht aus der Perspektive der rechtlichen Volkskunde| year = 2009| publisher = GRIN Verlag| isbn = 3-640-40128-X| page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Noel Malcolm speculates that an article in Dušan's Code was an early attempt to clamp down on the self-administered customary law of the mountains, as later codified in the Kanun of Lek Dukagjin, and if so, this would be the earliest evidence that such [[customary law]]s were in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Malcolm| first = Noel| title = Kosovo A short history| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vcrWnQEACAAJ| year = 1998| publisher = New York University Press| isbn = 0-8147-5598-4| page = 54| location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the similarities the majority of scientists agree that the Code of Leke Dukagjini is not the same as Dusans Code and that such conclusions are "far-fetched". When the Turkish invaders conquered the medieval Serbian state many customary laws of social life amongst the Balkan peoples were brought back to use, this included the Albanians.&lt;ref name="The Code of Leke Dukagjini"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trnavci|first1=Professor Genc|title=Dr Genc Trnavci - The Code of Leke Dukajgini|url=http://www.design.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~hoken/Kazuhiko/2008Customarylaw.pdf|website=www.design.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~hoken/Kazuhiko/2008Customarylaw.pdf|page=13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615120555/http://www.design.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~hoken/Kazuhiko/2008Customarylaw.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The town of Shkodra had for example, before Dušan's Code, its own customary laws and rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lala|first1=Etleva|title=Women's Status in Medieval Albanian Laws|url=https://www.docdroid.net/vB0Ly5t/womens-status-in-medieval-albanian-laws.pdf.html|website=Etleva Lala, Sixth conference of the International Research Network, "Gender differences in the History of European Legal Cultures"|publisher=Solivagus, Kiel 2014|accessdate=5 February 2016}} P. 3-4 of the PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development and usage ==
The Law of Lek Dukagjini (kanun) was named after a medieval prince [[Lekë Dukagjini]] of the fifteenth century who ruled in northern Albania and codified the customary laws of the highlands.&lt;ref name="Gawrych30"/&gt; The code was written down only in the 19th century by [[Shtjefën Gjeçovi]] and partially published in the ''[[Hylli i Drites]]'' periodical in 1913.&lt;ref name=Co22/&gt; The full version appeared only in 1933 after Gjeçovi's death in 1926.&lt;ref name=Co22/&gt; In 1989 a dual English-Albanian version was published.&lt;ref name=Co22/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author4=Shtjefën Gjeçovi |author5=Leonard Fox| last1 = Dukagjini| first1 = Lekë| last2 = Gjeçov| first2 = Shtjefën| last3 = Fox| first3 = Leonard| title = Kanuni i Lekë Dukagjinit| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dZ-RAAAAMAAJ| accessdate = 2010-07-01| year = 1989| publisher = Gjonlekaj Pub.

Although the laws are attributed to Lekë Dukagjini, the laws evolved over time as a way to bring law and rule to these lands. The Kanun is divided into [[Kanun (Albania)#Content|12 sections]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciaonet.org/wps/yoa01/ Religion and Society in Present-Day Albania] by Antonia Young&lt;/ref&gt; and Gjeçovi's version has 1,262 articles which regulate all aspects of the mountainous life: economic organisation of the household, hospitality, brotherhood, clan, boundaries, work, marriage, land, and so on.&lt;ref name=Co22/&gt; The ''[[Besa (Albanian culture)|Besa]]'' (personal honour, compare with [[Latin language|Lat.]] ''fides'') and [[Honour#Cultures of honour and cultures of law|nderi]] (family honour, [[Latin language|Lat.]] ''honor'') are of prime importance throughout the code as the cornerstone of personal and social conduct.&lt;ref name=Co22/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych115"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=115.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kanun applies to both Christian and Muslim Albanians.&lt;ref name=Co22/&gt;

Some of the most controversial rules of the Kanun (in particular book 10 section 3) specify how murder is supposed to be handled, which often in the past and sometimes still now led to [[blood feud]]s that last until all the men of the two involved families are killed.&lt;ref name=spiegel_06June2014/&gt; In situations of murder tribal law stipulates the principle of ''koka për kokë'' (head for a head) where the relatives of the victim are obliged to seek ''gjakmarje'' (blood vengeance).&lt;ref name="Gawrych30"/&gt;  Women are only seen as producers of offspring and are referred to in a [[Misogyny|discriminatory manner]] and so are not considered worthy targets.&lt;ref name=spiegel_06June2014&gt;{{cite news|title='We'll Get You': An Albanian Boy's Life Ruined by Blood Feuds|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/blood-feuds-still-prevalent-in-albania-a-973498.html|accessdate=12 June 2014|work=[[Spiegel Online]]|publisher=Spiegel Online GmbH|date=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Albanian name for blood feud is ''[[Gjakmarrja]]''. In some parts of the country, the Kanun resembles the Italian vendetta.&lt;ref name="kanun"&gt;{{cite news |title=Reportage : Albanie, la Bible contre la vendetta |author=Angélique Kourounis |author2=Thomas Iacobi |author3= Jean Christophe Georgoustsos|author4=Nikos Arapoglou|url=http://www.rts.ch/video/emissions/religion/faut-pas-croire/4439559-reportage-albanie-la-bible-contre-la-vendetta.html |format=video|newspaper=Faut pas croire |publisher= [[Radio télévision suisse]]|location=Geneva, Switzerland|date= 17 November 2012|accessdate=25 January 2013 |language=French}} Des jeunes catholiques, soutenus par une religieuse, ont brisé la loi du silence pour combattre le « kanun », un code d'honneur ancestral qui justifie la vengeance et le meurtre.&lt;/ref&gt; These rules have resurfaced during the 1990s in Northern Albania, since people had no faith in the powerless local government and police. There are organizations that try to mediate between feuding families and try to get them to "pardon the blood" ({{lang-sq|Falja e Gjakut}}), but often the only resort is for men of age to stay in their homes, which are considered a safe refuge by the Kanuni, or flee the country. Tribal also held that thieves would need to pay fines to the relative amount that was stolen.&lt;ref name="Gawrych30"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=30.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albanian tribes from the Dibra region (known as the "Tigers of Dibra") governed themselves according to the Law of Skanderbeg, named after a fifteenth century warrior who fought the Ottomans.&lt;ref name="Gawrych36"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gawrych|first=George|title=The Crescent and the Eagle: Ottoman rule, Islam and the Albanians, 1874–1913|year=2006|location=London|publisher=IB Tauris|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=wPOtzk-unJgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+crescent+and+the+eagle:+Ottoman+rule,+Islam+and+the+Albanians,+1874-1913+lexicon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT94zl8ebXAhWJT7wKHYRLADEQ6AEIJjAA#v=snippet&amp;q=law%20of%20Lek&amp;f=false|isbn=9781845112875|pages=36.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former communist leader of Albania [[Enver Hoxha]] effectively stopped the practice of Kanun with hard repression and a very strong state police. However, after the fall of communism, some communities have tried to rediscover the old traditions, but some of their parts have been lost, leading to fears of misinterpretation.

Notably, the current Albanian Penal Code does not contain any provisions from the Kanun that deal with blood feuds, and no acknowledgment of this code is made in the contemporary Albanian legal system.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} In 2014 about 3,000 Albanian families were estimated to be involved in blood feuds and this since the fall of Communism has led to the deaths of 10,000 people.&lt;ref name=spiegel_06June2014/&gt;

== Pillars of the Kanun ==
The Kanun is based on four pillars:
* Honour ({{lang-sq|Nderi}})
* Hospitality ({{lang-sq|Mikpritja}})
* Right Conduct ({{lang-sq|Sjellja}})
* Kin Loyalty ({{lang-sq|Fis}})

==Kanun in literature and film==
Albanian writer [[Ismail Kadare]] evokes the Kanun several times in his books and has it as the main theme in his novel [[Broken April]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longitudebooks.com/find/p/67067/mcms.html|title=Broken April - Ismail Kadare|publisher=Longitude|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also evoques the kanun in his novel {{lang|sq|Komisioni i festës}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Komisioni i festës|last=Kadare|first=Ismail|year=1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VjHIOgAACAAJ|location=Prishtinë|publisher=Rilindja}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-en|The Celebration Commission}}), where Kadare literally describes the [[Monastir massacre of 1830]] as the struggle between two empires: the Albanian Kanun with its code of ''besa'' and the Ottoman Empire itself.&lt;ref name="Co82"&gt;{{cite book| last = Colafato| first = Michele| title = Emozioni e confini per una sociologia delle relazioni etniche| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KS5NwIa3Pc0C| accessdate = 2010-07-01| year = 1998| publisher = Meltemi Editore srl| isbn = 88-86479-69-7| page = 82 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kadare in his [[Literary criticism|literary critique]] book {{lang|sq|Eskili, ky humbës i madh}} ({{lang-en|Aeschylus, this big loser}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Kadare| first = Ismail| title = Eskili, ky humbës i madh| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1t6eLAAACAAJ| accessdate = 2010-07-01| year = 2006| publisher = Onufri| location = Tirana| isbn = 99943-32-63-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where ''loser'' refers to the great number of tragedies that were lost from [[Aeschylus]], there are evident similarities between the ''kanun'' and the [[feud|vendetta]]&lt;ref name="kanun" /&gt; customs in all the Mediterranean countries.

[[Barbara Nadel]]'s ''Deep Waters''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Nadel| first = Barbara| title = Deep Waters| url = https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Waters-Inspector-Ikmen-Mysteries/dp/0747267197| year = 2002| publisher = Headline Book Pub Limited| isbn = 0-7472-6719-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to Kanun and [[Gjakmarrja]].

[[Joshua Marston]]'s 2011 film [[The Forgiveness of Blood]], a drama set in modern-day Albania, deals with the Kanun. The film relates a blood feud between two families in Northern Albania, focusing primarily on how the feud affects the children of one family.

The Kanun is referred to in season 6, episode 9 of [[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]] ("[[Blasters (Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent)|Blasters]]") as the explanation for the sudden retreat of a group of Albanian assassins.

The Kanun plays a major role in the Belgian movie [[Dossier K]].

[[Elvira Dones]]'s ''Sworn Virgin''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Dones| first = Elvira| title = Sworn Virgin| url = https://www.amazon.com/Sworn-Virgin-Elvira-Dones-ebook/dp/B00IHH2NZI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1400792599&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sworn+virgin| year = 2014| publisher = And Other Stories| isbn = 978-1-908276-34-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to Kanun and women's practice of swearing celibacy in return to being accepted as men by all local villagers.

Belgian TV maker Tom Waes visited Albania during one of the shows in his series Reizen Waes. He was served spit roasted goat and was offered the head of the goat. According to Kanun rules, this is how they honor a guest during dinner.&lt;ref&gt;http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/cultuur%2Ben%2Bmedia/media/1.2235741&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kanun is referred to in "The Closer" Season 6 | Episode 14 "The investigation into the Albanian blood feud" &lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1626048/

== Yoga Practice and Training ==
Huggins began practicing yoga in 2002 to counteract chronic back pain.  In 2010 he became a registered yoga teacher with a 200-Hour Level certification from Power Yoga Works recognized by [[Yoga Alliance]]. Later that year he trained with Street Yoga to teach yoga and mindfulness to at-risk youth and vulnerable populations. He has since trained at the [[Kripalu Center|Kripalu Yoga Center]], [[Omega Institute for Holistic Studies]], the Prison Yoga Project, Power Yoga Works, and other organizations to gain additional skills as a teacher, including for incarcerated populations and veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bense|first1=Michelle|title=Transformation Yoga Project Uses Yoga to Heal Addiction and Trauma|url=http://issuu.com/nabuxmont/docs/na_buxmont_june15_/20|website=issuu.com|publisher=Natural Awakenings|accessdate=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Michael Huggins|url=https://www.yogaalliance.org/TeacherPublicProfile?tid=30284|website=yogaalliance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huggins studied Accounting at [[Villanova University]] and received an MBA from the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Profile: Michael Huggins|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=8295616&amp;privcapId=7407998|website=bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has worked as a Senior Auditor at [[Arthur Andersen]] and Co., Manager of Treasury Operations for [[Kenner Products|Kenner Parker Toys]], Vice President of Administration for Town &amp; County Corp., CFO/COO for Spectra Science, President and COO for [[Synthes|Synthes, Inc.]], CEO for Scient’x, and most recently as a Consultant for MDH Advisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scient'x, S.A.

== Incarceration ==
In July 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice charged [[Synthes]] and a subsidiary with various offenses relating to a bone cement regulated by the federal government as a medical device.  The government also charged four company executives, including Michael Huggins, with a strict liability misdemeanor offense.  After pleading guilty to the strict liability misdemeanor charge, Huggins was sentenced in November 2011 to a nine-month prison term, a $100,000 fine, and three months of supervised release following his release from custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judgment in a Criminal Case|url=http://www.circare.org/lex/09cr00403_judghug_20111121.pdf|website=circare.org|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transformation Yoga Project ==
In 2010, Huggins began working with community organizations to provide yoga to at-risk youth, and as after-school programming for young people. During his first weeks in prison Huggins began teaching yoga and [[guided meditation]] to his fellow inmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Huggins|first1=Michael|title=Back to Basics: Yoga in Prison|url=http://www.phillyareayoga.com/back-to-basics-a-yogis-view-from-prison/|website=phillyareayoga.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of his teaching spurred him to train fellow inmates as teachers also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bense|first1=Michelle|title=Transformation Yoga Project Uses Yoga to Heal Addiction and Trauma|url=http://issuu.com/nabuxmont/docs/na_buxmont_june15_/20|website=issuu.com|publisher=Natural Awakenings|accessdate=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his release from prison, Huggins attended a Prison Yoga Project training course and soon after began returning to prisons as a volunteer yoga instructor. Huggins found that yoga could be a therapy and build emotional tools against the traumas of living in prison as well as the traumas that came before incarceration, such as [[homelessness]], [[Addiction|drug abuse]], and [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pence|first1=Mary|title=Why Teach Yoga to Prisoners?|url=http://www.maryspence.org/blog/2015/06/04/why-teach-yoga-to-prisoners/|website=maryspence.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Michael|first1 = Huggins|url = https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCW26WAmaB0Dkw9x45O635w|website = youtube.com|title = Transformation Yoga Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Huggins founded Transformation Yoga Project as a non-profit organization with a mission to train and provide teachers with yoga and mindfulness techniques that specifically support people with traumatic or addictive backgrounds in an effort to heal, build emotional stability, and reduce the stresses of imprisoned, rehabilitative, post-traumatic, or transitional living circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yoga for Trauma and Addiction – Teacher Training From Transformation Yoga Project|url=http://www.phillyareayoga.com/event/yoga-for-trauma-and-addiction-teacher-training-from-transformation-yoga-project/|website=phillyareayoga.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transformation Yoga Project encourages the yoga teachers it trains to embrace [[Selfless service|seva]], the religious concept of serving selflessly. The goals of Transformation Yoga Project include curbing recidivism rates by enabling inmates to heal, develop greater maturity, and create positive growth for themselves. Many within prison administrations embrace yoga and mindfulness programs because of the benefits to the inmate populations during and after incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yoga for Trauma and Addiction – Teacher Training From Transformation Yoga Project|url=http://www.phillyareayoga.com/event/yoga-for-trauma-and-addiction-teacher-training-from-transformation-yoga-project/|website=phillyareayoga.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schware|first1=Rob|title=Transforming Yoga: Healing Through Empowerment In Prisons And Drug Rehabilitation Facilities|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rob-schware/transforming-yoga-healing_b_6141496.html|website=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clarke-Fields|first1=Hunter|title=Prison Yoga Transformation with Mike Huggins|url=http://www.hunteryoga.com/blog/024-prison-yoga/|website=hunteryoga.com|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transformation Yoga Project runs programs in numerous facilities including at the [[State Correctional Institution – Graterford|State Correctional Institute at Graterford]], the [[Philadelphia Prison System|Philadelphia Prison System’s Cambria Community Center]], the Montgomery County Youth Detention Center, the Montgomery County Youth Shelter, the Delaware County Juvenile Detention Center, the [[Federal Detention Center, Philadelphia|Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia]], the [[Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital|Kirkbride Center for recovery]], [[State Correctional Institution – Chester|Gaudenzia house]], the Divine Light Recovery House, the ODDAT Synergy House, and at the Veterans Hospital in Coatesville, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yoga for Recovery|url=http://www.transformationyogaproject.org/who-we-serve-1#yoga-for-recovery|website=transformationyogaproject.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15683">In 1938, [[Henry Murray]]  developed a system of [[needs]] as part of his theory of personality, which he called 'personology.' He argued that everyone had a set of universal basic needs, with individual differences on these needs leading to the uniqueness of personality through varying dispositional tendencies for each need; in other words, specific needs are more important to some than to others. In his theory, Murray argues that needs and presses (another component of the theory) acted together to create an internal state of disequilibrium; the individual is then driven to engage in some sort of behavior to reduce the tension. Murray believed that the study of personality should look at the entire person over the course of their lifespan – that people needed to be analysed in terms of complex interactions and whole systems rather than individual parts – and an individual's behaviors, needs and their levels, etc. are all part of that understanding. Murray also argued that there was a biological (specifically neurological) basis for personality and behavior&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Henry A|title=Explorations in Personality|date=1938|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flett|first1=Gordon L|title=Personality theory and research: an international perspective|date=2014|publisher=Wiley Global Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Needs ==

Murray defines a need as a drive that has the potential to prompt a behavior from the person. For example, the need for affiliation may drive a person to join social organization. Needs are often influenced by environmental stimulus or 'presses,' another component of Murray's theory.

Individual differences in levels of needs lead to the uniqueness of a person's personality; in other words, specific needs may be more important to some than to others. According to Murray, human needs are psychogenic in origin, function on an unconscious level, and can play a major role in defining personality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Frustration of these psychogenic needs plays a central role in the origin of [[psychological pain]].&lt;ref name="Shneidman_1996"&gt;{{vcite book | author = Shneidman ES | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = The Suicidal Mind | edition = | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = | year = 1996 | pages =  | isbn = | chapter =  | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=rn4pf7-dca0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+suicidal+mind&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qIGjSw106n&amp;sig=A2b8DvJxC9gwoHPAJiiiEFaqdeU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=N74RUMWMDKjmiwKX8oHIAQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20suicidal%20mind&amp;f=false | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed that these needs could be measured by projective tests, specifically one he had developed, known as the [[thematic apperception test]] (TAT). Unlike [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], Murray's needs are not based on a hierarchy; individuals may be high in one and low in the other, and multiple needs may be affected by a single action.

Murray differentiated each need as unique, but recognized commonalities among them, codified at least partially in his categorization system. Behaviors may meet more than one need:  for instance, performing a difficult task for your fraternity may meet the needs of both achievement and affiliation. While each need is important in and of itself, he also believed that needs can support or conflict with one another, and can be interrelated. He coined the term 'subsidation of needs' to describe when two or more needs are combined in order to satisfy a more powerful need, and the term 'fusion of needs' to describe when a single action satisfies more than one need.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, the need for dominance may conflict the need with affiliation when overly controlling behavior drives away family, romantic partners, and friends. A need may be a purely internal state, but more often it is evoked by a press.

== Presses ==

Murray argued environmental factors play a role in how psychogenic needs are displayed in behavior. He used the term 'presses' to describe external influences on motivation that may influence an individual's level of a need as well as their subsequent behavior. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The 'press' of an object is what it can do for or to the subject.

Any stimulus with the potential to affect the individual in a positive or negative way is referred to as 'pressive,' and everything else is referred to as inert. 'Pressive Perception' is how the subject interprets a press as either a positive or negative stimulus. 'Pressive Apperception' refers to the subjects anticipation that the stimulus will be perceived as either positive or negative. Murray notes that both Pressive Perception and Apperception are largely unconscious. Presses may have positive or negative effects, may be mobile (affecting the subject if they do nothing) or immobile (affecting the subject if they take an action), and may be an alpha press (real effects) or a beta press (merely perceived).

== Needs by Category ==
Murray divides needs into several binary categories; Manifest (Overt) or Latent (Covert), Conscious or Unconscious, and Primary (viscerogenic) and Secondary (psychogenic) needs&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Manifest (sometimes called overt) needs are those that are allowed to be directly expressed, while latent (sometimes called covert) needs are not outwardly acted on&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Paul|last2=Culbertson|first2=Amy L.|last3=Magnusson|first3=Paul|title=Human Needs: A Literature Review and Cognitive Life Span Model|journal=Navy Personnel Research and Development Center|date=April 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Conscious needs as those that a subject can self-report, while Unconscious needs are all others. This is distinct from manifest vs latent in that a person may directly express a need they are unaware of, or not express a need they are aware of. The categorization most commonly referred to is the division between Primary (viscerogenic) and Secondary (psychogenic) needs.

=== Primary/Viscerogenic Needs ===
Primary (Viscerogenic) needs are defined by Murray&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as needs involving some biological process and arise in response to certain stimuli or events that drive the body towards a certain outcome ('positive' or 'negative').For example, dehydration would trigger a "need for water," which in turn drives a person to seek out and intake water. The first six primary needs; Air, Water, Food, Sentience, Sex, and Lactation, are considered 'positive' needs, as they drive a person towards a certain object or action. The remaining seven; Expiration, Urination, Defecation, and the four avoidance needs (see 'Retraction' below), are considered to be 'negative' needs as they drive a person away from an object (or in some cases towards the expulsion of an object).

=== Secondary/Psychogenic Needs ===
Secondary (Psychogenic) needs emerge from or are influenced by primary needs. Murray identified 17 secondary needs, each belonging to one of eight need domains: Ambition, Materialism, Status, Power, Sado-Masochism, Social-Conformance, Affection, and Information. Needs in each domain have similar themes underpinning them; for instance, the Ambition domain contains all those needs which relate to achievement and recognition.

==Applications==

===Personality testing===

Murray's system of needs has influenced the creation of personality testing, including both objective and subjective measures&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. A personality test is a questionnaire or other standardized instrument designed to reveal aspects of an individual's character or psychological makeup. Murray's system of needs directly influenced the development of a variety of personality measures, including the ''Personality Research Form'' and the ''Jackson Personality Inventory''&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Henry A|title=Thematic apperception test.|date=1943|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Thematic apperception test===

Henry Murray, along with [[Christiana Morgan]], developed the [[thematic apperception test]] (TAT) as a tool to assess personality. The TAT is based on the assumption that human unconscious needs are directed towards an external stimulus. Murray and Morgan created the TAT to evaluate "press" and "need," which Murray emphasized in his theory of personality. The TAT is administered  by an  assessor, who chooses a subset of cards (generally concerning a particular theme, or those that they feel best suit the subject) out of the 32 available; Murray recommended selecting 20&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cramer|first1=P|title=Storytelling, narrative, and the Thematic Apperception Test.|date=2004|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Each card features various ambiguous scenes which relate to interpersonal situations. The test-taker is asked to give a detailed explanation of what they see. For example, an explanation may include a narrative of what is happening and what may unfold, and what the characters in the scene are feeling or thinking. From this narrative, the assessor uses Murray's theoretical themes to infer personality characteristics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Further research===

Murray's theory of personality was the basis for several areas of further psychological research. Three of the needs he identified–the [[need for power]], the [[need for affiliation]], and the [[need for achievement]]–were later the subject of substantial study and considered especially significant; used to develop theories such as [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], [[David McClelland]]'s 'Achievement Motivation Theory', aspects of [[Richard Boyatzis]]' competency-based models of management effectiveness, and more.

Murray's concept of the 'press' and his emphasis on the importance of environmental events (and their subjective interpretation) were also highly significant to later psychological research. Behavioral psychology-pioneered by [[John B. Watson]] and [[B. F. Skinner]]-focused on environmental events, while cognitive psychology included a focus on subjective interpretation of events, based on another one of Murray's ideas (his categorization of presses as either Alpha or Beta).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Salem health: psychology &amp; mental health|last1=Piotrowski|first1=Nancy A|date=2010|publisher=Salem Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

Although Murray's theory has had a substantial influence on personality testing and research, some critics say that his system of needs is too broad and rather subjective. One criticism of this hierarchy is that it lacks the objective criterion for needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality: Determinants, Dynamics, and Potentials|last=Cervone|first=Daniel|last2=Vittorio Caprara|first2=Gian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=0521587484|location=|pages=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be said that some of the needs can conflict with each other like achievement and nurturance, which deal with opposing ideas of having to obstacles with achievement being active and nurturance being passive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When evaluating the TAT, critics have claimed that the test has a low test-retest reliability and validity. This could possibly be due to contrasting instructions from the experimenters.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19237">'''Natural genetic engineering''' (NGE) is a class of process proposed by molecular biologist [[James A. Shapiro|James Shapiro]] to account for novelty created in the course of biological evolution. Shapiro developed this work in several peer-reviewed publications from 1992 onwards, and later in his 2011 book '''''Evolution: A View from the 21st Century'''''&lt;!--redirects here--&gt;. He uses NGE to account for several proposed counterexamples to the [[central dogma of molecular biology]] (the subsequently partly rejected proposal of 1970 that the direction of the flow of sequence information is only from DNA to DNA or DNA to RNA to proteins, and never the reverse). Shapiro drew from work as diverse as the adaptivity of the mammalian immune system, [[ciliate]] [[Macronucleus|macronuclei]] and [[epigenetics]]. The work gained some measure of notoriety after being championed by proponents of [[Intelligent Design]], despite Shapiro's explicit repudiation of that movement.

==Concept==
Shapiro first laid out his ideas of natural genetic engineering in 1992&lt;ref name="Shapiro 1992" /&gt; and has continued to develop them in both the primary scientific literature&lt;ref name="Shapiro 1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro 1999b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2002" /&gt; and in work directed to wider audiences,&lt;ref name="Shapiro 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2007" /&gt; culminating in the 2011 publication of ''Evolution: A View from the 21st Century''.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2011" /&gt;

Natural genetic engineering is a reaction against the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] and the [[central dogma of molecular biology]]. The modern synthesis was formulated before the elucidation of the double-helix structure of [[DNA]] and the establishment of [[molecular biology]] in its current status of prominence. Given what was known at the time a simple, powerful model of genetic change through undirected mutation (loosely described as "[[Randomness|random]]") and natural selection, was seen as sufficient to explain evolution as observed in nature. With the discovery of the nature and roles of [[nucleic acid]]s in genetics, this model prompted [[Francis Crick]]'s so-called Central Dogma of Molecular Biology: "[Sequential] information cannot be transferred back from protein to either protein or nucleic acid."&lt;ref name="crick1958"&gt;Crick, F.H.C. (1958): [http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/B/F/T/_/scbbft.pdf On Protein Synthesis.] Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. XII, 139-163. (pdf, early draft of original article)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crick1970"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crick | first1 = F | title = Central dogma of molecular biology. | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/crick/pdf/crick227.pdf | pmid = 4913914  |name-list-format=vanc | journal = Nature | doi=10.1038/227561a0 | volume=227 | issue=5258 | pages = 561–3 |date=August 1970 | bibcode=1970Natur.227..561C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shapiro points out that multiple cellular systems can affect DNA in response to specific environmental stimuli.  These "directed" changes stand in contrast to both the undirected mutations in the modern synthesis and (in Shapiro's interpretation) the ban on information flowing from the environment into the genome.

In the 1992 ''[[Genetica]]'' paper that introduced the concept, Shapiro begins by listing three lessons from molecular genetics:
* there is a surprising amount of genetic conservation across taxonomic boundaries,
* the mosaic structure of the genome results in multiple nonlocal genes having multiple phylogenic effects, and, drawing on the work of his friend and collaborator [[Barbara McClintock]],
* the existence of multiple cellular mechanisms (including [[mobile genetic elements]]) that can restructure DNA.
From these, Shapiro concludes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[I]t can be argued that much of genome change in evolution results from a genetic engineering process utilizing the biochemical systems for mobilizing and reorganizing DNA structures present in living cells.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 1992" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Relation with Intelligent Design==
In a 1997 [[Boston Review]] article, Shapiro lists
four categories of discoveries made in molecular biology that, in his
estimation, are not adequately accounted for by the [[Modern_synthesis_(20th_century)|Modern Synthesis]]:  [[genome]] organization, [[DNA repair|cellular repair]] capabilities, [[mobile genetic elements]] and cellular information processing.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 1997 Third Way" /&gt;  Shapiro concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What significance does an emerging interface between biology and information
science hold for thinking about evolution? It opens up the possibility of
addressing scientifically rather than ideologically the central issue so hotly
contested by fundamentalists on both sides of the Creationist-Darwinist debate:
Is there any guiding intelligence at work in the origin of species displaying
exquisite adaptations that range from lambda prophage repression and the Krebs
cycle through the mitotic apparatus and the eye to the immune system, mimicry,
and social organization?&lt;ref name="Shapiro 1997 Third Way" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within the context of the article in particular and Shapiro's work on Natural
Genetic Engineering in general, the "guiding intelligence" is to be found
within the cell.  (For example, in a [[Huffington Post]] essay entitled
[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-a-shapiro/cell-cognition_b_1354889.html Cell Cognition and Cell Decision-Making]&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2012a" /&gt; Shapiro
defines cognitive actions as those that are "knowledge-based and involve decisions appropriate
to acquired information," arguing that cells meet this criteria.)  However,
the combination of disagreement with the Modern Synthesis and discussion of
a creative intelligence has brought his work to the attention of advocates
of [[Intelligent Design]].

Natural genetic engineering has been cited as a legitimate scientific controversy (in contrast to the controversies raised by various branches of [[creationism]]).&lt;ref name="Koperski 2008" /&gt;  While Shapiro considers the questions raised by Intelligent Design to be interesting, he parts ways with creationists by considering these problems to be scientifically tractable (specifically by understanding how NGE plays a role in the evolution of novelty).&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2002" /&gt;

With the publication of ''Evolution:  A View from the 21st Century'',
Shapiro's work again came under discussion in the Intelligent design community.
In a conversation with Shapiro, [[William Dembski]] asked for Shapiro's
thoughts on the origins of natural genetic engineering systems.  Shapiro replied that "where they come from in the first place is not a question we can realistically answer right now."&lt;ref name="Dembski 2012" /&gt;
While Dembski sees this position as at least not inconsistent with Intelligent
Design, Shapiro has explicitly and repeatedly rejected both creationism in
general&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2012b"/&gt; and Intelligent Design in particular.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2012c" /&gt;

==Criticism==

While Shapiro developed NGE in the peer-reviewed literature, the idea attracted far more attention when he summarized his work in his book ''Evolution:  A View from the 21st Century''.
&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2011" /&gt; In part due to its discussion of the Intelligent Design movement, the book was widely and critically reviewed.&lt;ref name="Moran 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Seoighe 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bezak 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Penny 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilkins 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Buratti 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Li 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yu 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ussery 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kutschera 2012" /&gt;  Criticism falls into two main categories:

:#  ''The theory crosses the line into [[teleology]]'', a line exemplified by the review written by Larry Moran.&lt;ref name="Moran 2011" /&gt;  The form of Shapiro's argument has points of resemblance to several creationist arguments to the effect that observed biology cannot be explained by a combination of "random" (undirected) mutation and natural selection.  One of the many standard responses to these arguments is that biology can be sufficiently explained without invoking higher causes.  Shapiro's view differs significantly from that of creationists, not the least because his higher causes exist only at the level of cellular machinery.  However, to a critic unpersuaded of the need for higher causes, it is not persuasive to substitute material higher causes for the supernatural.
:#  ''Shapiro does not give a fair reading of the central dogma.''  Shapiro's reading of the central dogma requires that ''only'' random mutations can be the root of evolutionary change.  If this reading is correct, then, ignoring the looseness of such an application of the term "[[Randomness|random]]", the several mechanisms identified by Shapiro (''e.g.'', [[epigenetics]]) do indeed falsify this theory.  However, Crick and geneticists in general had long been well aware of the existence of mutagens at the time of the formulation and restatement of the central dogma, and in fact before the discovery of the mechanisms of biological heredity.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Thomas Hunt. The mechanism of Mendelian heredity  New York, Holt, 1915 [https://archive.org/details/mechanismmendel00morggoog]&lt;/ref&gt;  A more conservative interpretation, in the words of [[Marshall Nirenberg]], is simply that "DNA makes RNA makes protein."&lt;ref name="Nirenberg" /&gt;  Under this reading, proteins would not be expected to modify DNA, but Shapiro provides multiple examples of where this occurs, including [[histone modification]], mutagenic subclasses of [[DNA repair|excision and repair enzymes]], extensive regulation of mobile genetic elements, and various classes of RNA regulation, and direct modification of nucleotides via [[cytosine methylation]] and [[Cytosine deaminase|enzymatic deamination]].&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2013" /&gt;

Shapiro responded to the review in ''Evolutionary Intelligence''.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2012" /&gt;

In [[ontology]] and the [[philosophy of mind]], a '''non-physical entity''' is a spirit or being that exists outside physical reality. Their existence divides the philosophical school of [[physicalism]] from the schools of [[idealism]] and [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]; with the latter schools holding that they can exist and the former holding that they cannot. If one posits that non-physical entities can exist, there exist further debates as to their inherent natures and their position relative to physical entities.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=9&amp;ndash;10}}

==Abstract concepts==
{{main|Abstract and concrete}}
{{see also|Abstraction}}

Philosophers generally do agree on the existence of [[abstract object]]s. These include concepts such as [[number]]s, mathematical [[set (mathematics)|set]]s and [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, and philosophical [[relation (philosophy)|relation]]s and [[property (philosophy)|properties]]. Such entities are not physical inasmuch as they exist outside [[spacetime|space and time]]. An abstract property such as [[red]]ness also has no location in space-time.{{sfn|Jubien|2003|p=36&amp;ndash;38}}{{sfn|Moreland|Craig|2003|p=184&amp;ndash;185}} There are two concepts one being abstract and the other being concrete. The reason why these concepts are put into two separate categories is to make a distinction between metaphysics and epistemology. While older [[cartesian dualism|Cartesian dualists]] held the existence of non-physical minds, more limited forms of dualism propounded by 20th and 21st century philosophers (such as [[property dualism]]) hold merely the existence of non-physical properties.{{sfn|Balog|2009|p=293}}

== Mind–body dualism ==
{{see also|Dualism (philosophy of mind)}}

Dualism is the division of two contrasted or opposed aspects.The dualist school supposes the existence of non-physical entities, the most widely discussed one being the mind. But beyond that it runs into stumbling blocks.{{sfn|Bechtel|1988|p=82}} [[Pierre Gassendi]] put one such problem directly to [[René Descartes]] in 1641, in response to Descartes's ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy|Meditations]]'':
{{quote|&amp;#91;It&amp;#93; still remains to be explained how that union and apparent intermingling &amp;#91;of mind and body &amp;hellip;&amp;#93; can be found in you, if you are incorporeal, unextended and indivisible &amp;#91;&amp;hellip;&amp;#93;. How, at least, can you be united with the brain, or some minute part in it, which (as has been said) must yet have some magnitude or extension, however small it be ? If you are wholly without parts how can you mix or appear to mix with its minute subdivisions ? For there is no mixture unless each of the things to be mixed has parts that can mix with one another.|sign=Gassendi 1641{{sfn|Bechtel|1988|p=82}}{{sfn|Richardson|1982|p=21}}}}

Descartes' response to Gassendi, and to Princess Elizabeth who asked him similar questions in 1643, is generally considered nowadays to be lacking, because it did not address what is known in the philosophy of mind as the interaction problem.{{sfn|Bechtel|1988|p=82}}{{sfn|Richardson|1982|p=21}} This is a problem for non-physical entities as posited by dualism: by what mechanism, exactly, do they interact with physical entities, and how can they do so? Interaction with physical systems requires physical properties which a non-physical entity does not possess.{{sfn|Jaworski|2011|p=79&amp;ndash;80}}

Dualists either, like Descartes, avoid the problem by considering it impossible for a non-physical mind to conceive the relationship that it has with the physical, and so impossible to explain philosophically, or assert that the questioner has made the fundamental mistake of thinking that the distinction between the physical and the non-physical is such that it prevents each from affecting the other.

Other questions about the non-physical which dualism has not answered include such questions as how many minds each person can have, which is not an issue for physicalism which can simply declare one-mind-per-person almost by definition; and whether non-physical entities such as minds and souls are simple or compound, and if the latter, what "stuff" the compounds are made from.{{sfn|Smith|Jones|1986|p=48&amp;ndash;49}}

== Spirits ==
{{see also|spirit}}

Describing in philosophical terms what a non-physical entity actually is (or would be) can prove problematic. A convenient example of what constitutes a non-physical entity is a [[ghost]]. [[Gilbert Ryle]] once labelled [[Cartesian Dualism]] as positing the "[[ghost in the machine]]". {{sfn|Brown|2001|p=13}}{{sfn|Montero|2009|p=110&amp;ndash;111}} However, it is hard to define in philosophical terms what it is, precisely, about a ghost that makes it a specifically non-physical, rather than a physical entity. Were the existence of ghosts ever demonstrated beyond doubt, it has been claimed that would actually place them in the category of ''physical'' entities.{{sfn|Montero|2009|p=110&amp;ndash;111}}

Purported non-mental non-physical entities include things such as [[god]]s, [[angel]]s, [[demons]], and [[ghost]]s. Lacking demonstrations of their existence, their existences and natures are widely debated, independently of the philosophy of mind.{{sfn|Gracia|1996|p=18}}{{sfn|Malikow|2009|p=29&amp;ndash;31}}

'''OscilloScoop''' is an [[interactive music]] app for [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]] that runs on the [[iPad]], [[iPhone]], and [[iPod Touch]], available through the [[iTunes App Store]]. The app presents a real-time interface for creating electronic music in various [[electronic music]] genres from [[hip hop]] to [[techno]] and [[house music|house]]. The app is designed with a minimalist modern interface of three colored crowns, that spin like potters' wheels. Touching each crown affects the parameters of the audio. The top crown controls pitch, the middle a low pass resonant filter, and the bottom a fader. Controls on the left allow one to change the [[bassline]] beat, while buttons on the right allow the user to save their creation, and a slider below controls tempo.&lt;ref&gt;John Pavlus, [http://www.fastcodesign.com/1663839/oscilloscoop-ipad-app-turns-electro-djing-into-a-video-game Wanted: OscilloScoop iPad App Makes DJing A Video Game], FastCompany Design,  May 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://itunes.com/apps/oscilloscoop OscilloScoop in the iTunes App Store]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, OscilloScoop won the [[Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe|ZKM]] App Art Award, the first award ever given to art apps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.app-art-award.org/jury-winners/ 2011 ZKM App Art Award Winners]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

OscilloScoop was designed by [[Lukas Girling]], a creator of interactive musical interfaces who has worked with world-renowned musicians and music technologists including Laurie Anderson and Max Mathews. The app was created in collaboration with interactive artist and programmer [[Scott Snibbe]], author of the bestselling apps [[Bubble Harp]] and [[Gravilux]]; and [[Graham McDermott]], noted video game and app developer.&lt;ref&gt;Reyhan Harmanci, [http://www.baycitizen.org/blogs/culturefeed/mobile-artists-latest-release-video/ App Artist's Latest Release: OscilloScoop] Bay Citizen / New York Times, retrieved May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snibbe.com/store/oscilloscoop/ OscilloScoop description from snibbe.com], retrieved May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Girling and Snibbe began working together in 1996 at [[Interval Research]] researching new forms of musical instruments with [[Joy Mountford]] and [[Bob Adams (musician)|Bob Adams]]. As part of the research groups there, they were able to collaborate with, and learn from highly regarded musicians and musical pioneers including [[Brian Eno]], [[Laurie Anderson]], and [[Max Mathews]]. Their work at Interval Research was never published, and they recently re-united to produce a new app for [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]] that allows ordinary people to create electronic music with similar results as professionals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativeapplications.net/iphone/oscilloscoop-iphone-ipad-sound/ CreativeApplications.net OscilloScoop review] retrieved May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Their work borrows from the language of DJs, using the body's movements to create music in real-time, rather than composing music slice-by-slice with complex music authoring tools like [[ProTools]] and [[Ableton Live]], creating "something as effortless (and fun) as Super Mario," according to Snibbe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snibbe.com/blog/2011/05/03/music-of-chance/ Music of Chance],  blog posting by Scott Snibbe retrieved May 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers, such as [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], and [[Descartes]], have hypothesized that the feelings of '''pain (or suffering) and pleasure''' are part of a continuum.

There is strong evidence of biological connections between the neurochemical pathways used for the perception of both [[pain]] and [[pleasure]], as well as other psychological rewards.

==Perception of pain==

===Sensory input system===

From a stimulus-response perspective, the perception of physical pain starts with the [[nociceptors]], a type of physiological receptor that transmits neural signals to the brain when activated. These receptors are commonly found in the skin, membranes, deep fascias, mucosa, connective tissues of visceral organs, ligaments and articular capsules, muscles, tendons, periosteum, and arterial vessels.&lt;ref name="Almeida"&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15053950 Almeida, T. F., Roizenblatt, S., &amp; Tufik, S. (2004). "Afferent pain pathways: a neuroanatomical review." ''Brain Research'', 1000(1-2), 40-56.]&lt;/ref&gt; Once stimuli are received, the various afferent action potentials are triggered and pass along various fibers and axons of these nociceptive nerve cells into the dorsal horn of the spinal cord through the dorsal roots. A neuroanatomical review of the pain pathway, "Afferent pain pathways" by Almeida, describes various specific nociceptive pathways of the spinal cord: [[spinothalamic tract]], [[spinoreticular tract]], spinomesencephalic tract, spinoparabrachial tract, spinohypothalamic tract, spinocervical tract, postsynaptic pathway of the [[human vertebral column|spinal column]].&lt;ref name="Almeida" /&gt;

===Neural coding and modulation===

Activity in many parts of the brain is associated with pain perception. Some of the known parts for the ascending pathway include the [[thalamus]], [[hypothalamus]], [[midbrain]], [[lentiform nucleus]], [[somatosensory cortex|somatosensory cortices]], insular, prefrontal, anterior and parietal cingulum.&lt;ref name=Apkarian&gt;{{cite journal|last=Apkarian|first=A. V.|author2=Bushnell, M. C. |author3=Treede, R. D. |author4=Zubieta, J. K. |title=Human brain mechanisms of pain perception and regulation in health and disease|journal=[[European Journal of Pain]]|year=2005|volume=9|issue=4|pages=463–484|url=http://www.apkarianlab.northwestern.edu/publications/Papers/200508_Apkarian.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.ejpain.2004.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Then, there are also the descending pathways for the modulation of pain sensation. One of the brainstem regions responsible for this is the [[periaqueductal gray]] of the midbrain, which both relieves pain by behavior as well as inhibits the activity of the nociceptive neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Other brainstem sites, such as the parabrachial nucleus, the [[dorsal raphe nucleus|dorsal raphe]], [[locus coeruleus]], and the medullary reticular formation also mediate pain relief and use many different neurotransmitters to either facilitate or inhibit activity of the neurons in the dorsal horn. These neurotransmitters include [[norepinephrine|noradrenaline]], [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], [[histamine]], and [[acetylcholine]].

==Perception of pleasure==

Pleasure can be considered from many different perspectives, from physiological (such as the hedonic hotspots that are activated during the experience) to psychological (such as the study of behavioral responses towards reward). Pleasure has also often been compared to, or even defined by many neuroscientists as, a form of alleviation of pain.&lt;ref name=Kringelbach2&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kringelbach |first=M. L. |author2=Berridge, K. C. |title=Towards a functional neuroanatomy of pleasure and happiness |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |year=2009 |volume=13 |issue=11 |pages=479–487 |url=http://www.lsa.umich.edu/psych/research&amp;labs/berridge/publications/Kringelbach%20&amp;%20Berridge%202009%20Toward%20functional%20neuroanatomy%20of%20pleasure%20and%20happiness%20TICS.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2009.08.006 |pmid=19782634 |pmc=2767390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neural coding and modulation===
Pleasure has been studied in the systems of taste, olfaction, auditory (musical), visual (art), and sexual activity. Well known hedonic hotspots involved in the processing of pleasure include the [[nucleus accumbens]], posterior ventral pallidum, [[amygdala]], other cortical and subcortical regions.&lt;ref name=Berridge&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berridge|first=K. C.|author2=Kringelbach, M. L.|title=Affective neuroscience of pleasure: reward in humans and animals|journal=[[Psychopharmacology (journal)|Psychopharmacology]] |year=2008|volume=199 |issue=3|pages=457–480 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h10384324x566083/fulltext.pdf |doi=10.1007/s00213-008-1099-6|pmid=18311558|pmc=3004012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The prefrontal and limbic regions of the [[neocortex]], particularly the orbitofrontal region of the prefrontal cortex, [[anterior cingulate cortex]], and the [[insular cortex]] have all been suggested to be pleasure causing substrates in the brain.&lt;ref name="Kringelbach2" /&gt;

==Psychology of pain and pleasure (reward-punishment system)==

One approach to evaluating the relationship between pain and pleasure is to consider these two systems as a reward-punishment based system. When pleasure is perceived, one associates it with reward. When pain is perceived, one associates with punishment. Evolutionarily, this makes sense, because often, actions that result in pleasure or chemicals that induce pleasure work towards restoring homeostasis in the body. For example, when the body is hungry, the pleasure of rewarding food to one-self restores the body back to a balanced state of replenished energy. Like so, this can also be applied to pain, because the ability to perceive pain enhances both avoidance and defensive mechanisms that were, and still are, necessary for survival.&lt;ref name="Esch"&gt;[http://www.nel.edu/pdf_/NEL250404R01_Esch-Stefano_p_.pdf Esch, T., &amp; Stefano, G. B. (2004). "The neurobiology of pleasure, reward processes, addiction and their health implications." ''Neuroendocrinology Letters'', 25(4), 235-251.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opioid and dopamine systems in pain and pleasure==
The neural systems to be explored when trying to look for a neurochemical relationship between pain and pleasure are the [[opioid]] and [[dopamine]] systems. The opioid system is responsible for the actual experience of the sensation, whereas the dopamine system is responsible for the anticipation or expectation of the experience. Opioids work in the modulation of pleasure or pain relief by either blocking neurotransmitter release or by hyperpolarizing neurons by opening up a potassium channel which effectively temporarily blocks the neuron.&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;[http://www.medaku.com/images/Dr_Fields_Opioids_Effect_Acu.pdf Fields, H. L. (2007). "Understanding how opioids contribute to reward and analgesia." ''Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine.'' 32, 242–246.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pain and pleasure on a continuum==

===Arguments for pain and pleasure on a continuum===
It has been suggested as early as 4th century BC that pain and pleasure occurs on a continuum. [[Aristotle]] claims this antagonistic relationship in his ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'':

:::"We may lay it down that Pleasure is a movement, a movement by which the soul as a whole is consciously brought into its normal state of being; and that Pain is the opposite."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet1-11.html Aristotle. ''Rhetoric'', 11]&lt;/ref&gt;

He describes pain and pleasure very much like a push-pull concept; human beings will move towards something that causes pleasure and will move away from something that causes pain.

====Common neuroanatomy====
On an anatomical level, it can be shown the source for the modulation of both pain and pleasure originates from neurons in the same locations, including the [[amygdala]], the [[globus pallidus|pallidum]], and the [[nucleus accumbens]]. Not only have Leknes and Tracey, two leading neuroscientists in the study of pain and pleasure, concluded that pain and reward processing involve many of the same regions of the brain, but also that the functional relationship lies in that pain decreases pleasure and rewards increase analgesia, which is the relief from pain.&lt;ref name=Leknes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leknes|first=S.|author2=Tracey, I.|title=A common neurobiology for pain and pleasure|journal=[[Nature Reviews Neuroscience]]|year=2008|volume=9|issue=4|pages=314–320|doi=10.1038/nrn2333|url=http://66.199.228.237/boundary/Sexual_Addiction/pain_pleasure_endogenous_opiods_sex.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments against pain and pleasure on a continuum===

====Asymmetry between pain and pleasure====

Thomas Szasz, the late Professor of Psychiatry Emeritus at the State University of New York Health Science Center in Syracuse, New York, explored how pain and pleasure are not opposites ends of a spectrum in his 1957 book, "Pain and Pleasure -a study of bodily feelings".

Szasz notes that although we often refer to pain and pleasure as opposites in such a way, that this is incorrect; we have receptors for pain, but none in the same way for pleasure; and so it makes sense to ask "where is the pain?" but not "where is the pleasure?".  With this vantage point established, the author delves into the topics of metaphorical pain and of legitimacy, of power relations, and of communications, and of myriad others.&lt;ref&gt;Szasz, T.S. (1957) ''Pain and Pleasure – a study of bodily feelings''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary hypotheses for the relationship between pain and pleasure==
Whether or not pain and pleasure are indeed on a continuum, it still remains scientifically supported that parts of the neural pathways for the two perceptions overlap. There is also scientific evidence that one may have opposing effects on the other. So why would it be evolutionarily advantageous to human beings to develop a relationship between the two perceptions at all?

South African neuroscientists presented evidence that there was  a physiological link on a continuum between pain and pleasure in 1980. First, the Neuroscientists, Gillman and Lichtigfeld demonstrated that there were two endogenous endorphin systems, one pain producing and the other pain relieving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillman M A,|first=M. A.|last2=Kok|first2=L|last3=Lichtigfeld|first3=F. J.|year=1980|title=Paradoxical effect of naloxone on nitrous oxide analgesia in man|url=|journal=Eur J Pharmacol|volume=61|pages=175–177|via=|doi=10.1016/0014-2999(80)90160-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillman|first=MA|last2=Lichtigfeld|first2=FJ|year=1981|title=A comparison of the effect of morphine sulphate and nitrous oxide analgesia on chronic pain states in man.|url=|journal=J Neurol Sci|volume=45|pages=41–45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillman MA|first=|last2=Kimmel|first2=I|last3=Lichtigfeld FJ|first3=FJ|year=1981|title=The dual system hypothesis of pain perception.|url=|journal=Neurolog Res|volume=3|pages=317–327|via=|doi=10.1080/01616412.1981.11739607}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short time later they showed that these two systems might also be involved in addiction, which is initially pursued, presumably for the pleasure generating or pain relieving actions of the addictive substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lichtigfeld|first=FJ|last2=Gillman|first2=MA.|year=1982|title=The treatment of alcoholic withdrawal states with oxygen and nitrous oxide.|url=|journal=S Afr Med J|volume=61|pages=349–351|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillman|first=MA|last2=Lichtigfeld|first2=FJ|year=1984|title=. The opioid and anti-opioid system in addiction.|url=|journal=S Afr Med J|volume=66|pages=592|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after they provided evidence that the endorphins system was involved in sexual pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillman|first=MA|last2=Lichtigfeld|first2=FJ|year=1983|title=The effect of nitrous oxide and naloxone on orgasm in human females. A preliminary report|url=|journal=J Sex Res|volume=19|pages=49–57|via=|doi=10.1080/00224498309551168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Kringelbach suggests that this relationship between pain and pleasure would be evolutionarily efficient, because it was necessary to know whether or not to avoid or approach something for survival. According to Dr. [[Norman Doidge]], the brain is limited in the sense that it tends to focus on the most used pathways. Therefore, having a common pathway for pain and pleasure could have simplified the way in which human beings have interacted with the environment (Dr. [[Morten Kringelbach]], personal communication, October 24, 2011).

Leknes and Tracey offer two theoretical perspectives to why a relationship could be evolutionarily advantageous.

===Opponent process theory===
The [[opponent-process theory]] is a model that views two components as being pairs that are opposite to each other, such that if one component is experienced, the other component will be repressed. Therefore, an increase in pain should bring about a decrease in pleasure, and a decrease in pain should bring about an increase in pleasure or pain relief. This simple model serves the purpose of explaining the evolutionarily significant role of homeostasis in this relationship. This is evident since both seeking pleasure and avoiding pain are important for survival. Leknes and Tracey provide an example:&lt;ref name="Leknes2"/&gt;

:::"In the face of a large food reward, which can only be obtained at the cost of a small amount of pain, for instance, it would be beneficial if the pleasurable food reduced pain unpleasantness."&lt;ref name="Leknes2"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Leknes S. |author2=Brooks J. C. W. |author3=Wiech K. |author4=Tracey I. | year = 2008 | title = Pain relief as an opponent process: a psychophysical investigation | url = | journal = European Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 794–801 | doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06380.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They then suggest that perhaps a common currency for which human beings determine the importance of the motivation for each perception can allow them to be weighed against each other in order to make a decision best for survival.&lt;ref name="Leknes2"/&gt;

===Motivation-decision model===
The Motivation-Decision Model, suggested by [http://archives.drugabuse.gov/meetings/painopioides/pdf/fields.pdf Fields], is centered around the concept that decision processes are driven by motivations of highest priority. The model predicts that in the case that there is anything more important than pain for survival will cause the human body to mediate pain by activating the descending pain modulation system described earlier.&lt;ref name="Leknes" /&gt;  Thus, it is suggested that human beings have developed the unconscious ability to endure pain or sometimes, even relieve pain if it can be more important for survival to gain a larger reward. It may have been more advantageous to link the pain and pleasure perceptions together to be able to reduce pain to gain a reward necessary for fitness, such as childbirth. Like the opponent-process theory, if the body can induce pleasure or pain relief to decrease the effect of pain, it would allow human beings to be able to make the best evolutionary decisions for survival.

==Clinical applications==

===Related diseases===
The following neurological and/or mental diseases have been linked to forms of pain or anhedonia: [[schizophrenia]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[addiction]], [[cluster headache]], [[chronic pain]].&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;Green, A.L., Pereira, E.A., Aziz, T.Z. "Deep brain stimulation and pleasure". ''Pleasures of the brain''. Eds. M. L. Kringelbach, K. C. Berridge. (2010). New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 302-319.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal trials===
A great deal of what is known about pain and pleasure today primarily comes from studies conducted with rats and primates.&lt;ref name= "Kringelbach"&gt;Kringelbach, M. L., &amp; Berridge, K. C. (2010). ''Pleasures of the Brain.'' New York, NY: Oxford University Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parkinson surgery.jpg|thumb|250px|Insertion of electrode during [[Deep Brain Stimulation]] surgery using a [[Stereotactic surgery#How it works#Types of stereotactic frame systems|stereotactic frame]]]]

===Deep brain stimulation===

[[Deep brain stimulation]] involves the electrical stimulation of deep brain structures by electrodes implanted into the brain. The effects of this neurosurgery has been studied in patients with [[Parkinson's disease]], [[tremor]]s, [[dystonia]], [[epilepsy]], depression, [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], [[Tourette's syndrome]], [[cluster headache]] and [[chronic pain]].&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt; A fine electrode is inserted into the targeted area of the brain and secured to the skull. This is attached to a pulse generator which is implanted elsewhere on the body under the skin. The surgeon then turns the frequency of the electrode to the voltage and frequency desired. Deep brain stimulation has been shown in several studies to both induce pleasure or even addiction as well as ameliorate pain. For chronic pain, lower frequencies (about 5–50&amp;nbsp;Hz) have produced analgesic effects, whereas higher frequencies (about 120–180&amp;nbsp;Hz) have alleviated or stopped pyramidal tremors in Parkinson's patients.&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt;

There is still further research necessary into how and why exactly DBS works. However, by understanding the relationship between pleasure and pain, procedures like these can be used to treat patients suffering from a high intensity or longevity of pain. So far, DBS has been recognized as a treatment for [[Parkinson's disease]], [[tremor]]s, and [[dystonia]] by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

PES has also been touted as a tool for rural development. In 2007, the [[World Bank]] released a document outlining the place of PES in development.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEEI/Resources/ProPoorPES-2col.pdf|title=Guidelines for "Pro-Poor" Payments for Environmental Services|last=Pagiola|first=Stefano|date=|website=worldbank.org|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the link between the environment and development had been officially recognized long before with the 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment]] and later reaffirmed by the [[Earth Summit|Rio Conference on Environment and Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/documents.multilingual/default.asp?documentid=97&amp;articleid=1503|title=Stockholm 1972 - Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment - United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)|last=UNEP|first=|date=|website=www.unep.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/documents.multilingual/default.asp?documentid=78&amp;articleid=1163|title=Rio Declaration - Rio Declaration on Environment and Development - United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)|last=UNEP|first=|date=|website=www.unep.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to note PES programs are usually not designed to be primarily poverty alleviation schemes, although they may incorporate development mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pagiola|first=Stefano|last2=Arcenas|first2=Agustin|last3=Platais|first3=Gunars|date=2005-02-01|title=Can Payments for Environmental Services Help Reduce Poverty?

Some PES programs involve contracts between consumers of ecosystem services and the suppliers of these services. However, the majority of the PES programs are funded by governments and involve intermediaries, such as non-government organisations. The party supplying the environmental services normally holds the [[property rights]] over an environmental good that provides a flow of benefits to the demanding party in return for compensation. In the case of private contracts, the beneficiaries of the [[ecosystem]] services are willing to pay a price that can be expected to be lower than their welfare gain due to the services. The providers of the ecosystem services can be expected to be willing to accept a payment that is greater than the cost of providing the services.

== Theoretical perspectives ==
There are three main theoretical perspectives concerning PES. The first is that of environmental economics, the second of ecological economics, and the third of those who reject the very idea of ecosystem services.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tacconi|first=Luca|date=2012-01-15|title=Redefining payments for environmental services|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800911004046|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=73|pages=29–36|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.09.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental economics ===
The basic conceptualization of nature from the perspective of environmental economics is that manufactured capital can be used as a substitute for [[natural capital]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gómez-Baggethun|first=Erik|last2=de Groot|first2=Rudolf|last3=Lomas|first3=Pedro L.|last4=Montes|first4=Carlos|date=2010-04-01|title=The history of ecosystem services in economic theory and practice: From early notions to markets and payment schemes|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092180090900456X|journal=Ecological Economics|series=Special Section - Payments for Environmental Services: Reconciling Theory and Practice|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1209–1218|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of PES provided by environmental economics is the most popular: a voluntary transaction between a service buyer and service seller that takes place on the condition that either a specific ecosystem service is provided or land is used in a way to secure that service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wunder|first=Sven|year=2005|title=Payments for environmental services: Some nuts and bolts|journal=Center for International Forestry Research|volume=Occasional Paper No.42}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is directly related to the Coase theorem, upon which PES is strongly based from the environmental economics perspective, which states that in a competitive market, in the absence of transaction costs and in the presence of clear property rights, direct negotiation between private parties can lead to efficient outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coase|first=R. H.|title=[[The Problem of Social Cost]]|url=|journal=The Journal of Law and Economics|volume=3|pages=1–44|doi=10.1086/466560|year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in reality, transaction costs are virtually always present and private parties cannot always reach agreements on their own. One of the main reasons is lack of sustained financing, which often leads governments to provide some type of funding assistance. The environmental economics theorists acknowledge that PES systems can resemble an environmental subsidy, complicating the strict Coasian backing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engel|first=Stefanie|last2=Pagiola|first2=Stefano|last3=Wunder|first3=Sven|date=2008-05-01|title=Designing payments for environmental services in theory and practice: An overview of the issues|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800908001420|journal=Ecological Economics|series=Payments for Environmental Services in Developing and Developed Countries|volume=65|issue=4|pages=663–674|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2008.03.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecological economics ===
The conceptualization of nature as understood by ecological economics is that manufactured capital and natural capital are not exclusive or substitutable, but rather complementary.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; PES as understood by ecological economics comprises three schematic components.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muradian|first=Roldan|last2=Corbera|first2=Esteve|last3=Pascual|first3=Unai|last4=Kosoy|first4=Nicolás|last5=May|first5=Peter H.|date=2010-04-01|title=Reconciling theory and practice: An alternative conceptual framework for understanding payments for environmental services|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800909004558|journal=Ecological Economics|series=Special Section - Payments for Environmental Services: Reconciling Theory and Practice|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1202–1208|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first surrounds the importance of the economic incentive. This idea concerns the relative weight an economic incentive may carry when understood in relation to social, moral, or other non-economic incentives.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; The second component is directness of the transfer, referring to the extent of interaction between ultimate buyers and sellers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; The most direct program would occur between one buyer and one seller, with no intermediaries. A relatively indirect program would remove the buyers and sellers from each other, placing intermediaries between them, commonly in the form of NGOs and governments. The third and final component is the degree of commodification. This addresses the extent to which the environmental service (ES) being provided can be specifically and clearly assessed and measured. Some ES may be relatively easy to assess, such as tons of carbon sequestered, while others may prove difficult.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Rejection of ecosystem services ===
Those who reject the idea of valuation of ecosystem services argue that nature should be conserved and valued for nature's sake, and that nature's value is impossible to quantify because its value is inherently infinite.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCauley|first=Douglas J.|date=2006-09-07|title=Selling out on nature|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7107/full/443027a.html?cookies=accepted|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=443|issue=7107|pages=27–28|doi=10.1038/443027a|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; They posit that the attempt to force the idea of ecosystem services into the market system leads to conservation only when it is deemed useful for human life, abandoning ideals environmental conservation when nature conflicts with human interest or simply does not affect human activity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are also those who support the valuation of nature from a purely practical standpoint, expressed in the idea that "something is better than nothing." They realize and acknowledge the problematic nature of the quantitative valuation of nature but at the same time argue that practically, in a highly commodified society, it is a necessary measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Costanza|first=Robert|last2=Daly|first2=Herman|year=1992|title=Natural Capital and Sustainable Development|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=6|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1992.610037.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commodification]] of natural capital results in undervaluing ecological systems by not accounting for the innumerable wide-range services provided. PES may decrease in utility as 1) wealth becomes concentrated to the point that natural resource scarcity results in higher short-term value for unsustainable resource extraction, and 2) the long-term cost to engineer limited-range replacement services is [[Externality|externalized]] onto citizens. This occurs either through increased expense to the existing systems or as justification to privatize services for further profit. For example, a parent corporation can profit both from the exploitation of an ecosystem, and by engineering and operating the services formerly provided.

==Organizations and motives for incentivizing production of ecosystem services==

Though the goal of all PES programs is the procurement of some sort of ecosystem service, the reasons why organizations or governments would incentivize the production of these services are diverse. For example, the world's largest and longest running PES program is the United States' [[Conservation Reserve Program]],&lt;ref name=jenk/&gt; which pays about $1.8 billion a year under 766,000 contracts with farmers and landowners to "rent" a total {{convert|34700000|acre|km2}} of what it considers "environmentally-sensitive land."&lt;ref name=programe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_1OB/.cmd/ad/.ar/sa.retrievecontent/.c/6_2_1UH/.ce/7_2_5JM/.p/5_2_4TQ/.d/1/_th/J_2_9D/_s.7_0_A/7_0_1OB?PC_7_2_5JM_contentid=2008%2F10%2F0251.xml&amp;PC_7_2_5JM_parentnav=LATEST_RELEASES&amp;PC_7_2_5JM_navid=NEWS_REL |title=USDA Issues $1.8 Billion in Conservation Reserve Payments |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |date=2012-06-29 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; These farmers agree to plant "long-term, resource-conserving covers to improve water quality, control soil erosion and enhance habitats for waterfowl and wildlife."&lt;ref name=programe/&gt; This program has existed in some form or another since the wake of the American [[Dust Bowl]], when the federal government began paying farmers to avoid farming on poor quality, erodible land.&lt;ref name=jenk/&gt;

In 1999, the Chinese central government announced an even more expensive project under its $43 billion [[Grain for Green]] program, by which it offers farmers grain in exchange for not clearing forested slopes for farming, thereby reducing erosion and saving the streams and rivers below from the associated deluge of sedimentation.&lt;ref name="ecosystemmarketplace1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/pages/article.news.php?component_id=4193&amp;component_version_id=6082&amp;language_id=12 |title=Grain for Green |publisher=Ecosystem Marketplace |date=2006-02-24 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, some sources cite the cost of the entire program at $95 billion.&lt;ref name=jenk/&gt; Many less extensive nationally funded PES projects which bear resemblances to the American and Chinese land set-aside programs exist around the world, including programs in Canada, the EU, Japan and Switzerland.&lt;ref name="ecosystemmarketplace1"/&gt;

==Examples==

=== North America ===

==== United States ====
In [[Jamestown, Rhode Island]], [[United States]], farmers usually harvest the hay in their fields twice a year. However, this practice destroys the habitats of many local grassland birds. Economists from the University of Rhode Island and EcoAssets Markets Inc. raised money from residents of Jamestown who were willing to help the birds. The range of investments was between $5 and $200 per person for a total of $9,800. This money was enough to compensate three Jamestown farms for the cost of reducing their yearly harvests and getting their hay from another source. In this way, the birds have sufficient time to nest and leave the grounds without being subject to a hay harvest. In this example, the farmers benefit because they only have to harvest their fields once a year instead of twice, and the contributors benefit because they value the lives of the birds more than the money they contributed to the project.

[[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]], [[United States]] has managed the majority of its watershed since the 1850s through multi-jurisdictional regulatory mechanisms such as specifying allowable uses (and restricting them), and purchasing land or conservation easements. This long-standing, legally-defensible, yet often-overlooked strategy preserves ecosystem services, while still allowing widely utilized recreation including skiing, snowboarding, hiking, mountain biking, and fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blanchard|first=Libby|last2=Vira|first2=Bhaskar|last3=Briefer|first3=Laura|date=2015-10-24|title=The Lost Narrative: Ecosystem service narratives and the missing Wasatch watershed conservation story|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212041615300462|journal=Ecosystem Services|volume=16|pages=105–111|doi=10.1016/j.ecoser.2015.10.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing uses of the land are generally unaffected, and commercial enterprises are restricted to no- or low-impact tourism-related activities.

=== Central and South America ===

==== Costa Rica ====
[[File:Costa_Rica_map_shaded_relief.png|thumb|Costa Rica]]
Costa Rica's PES program, ''Pagos por servicios ambientales'' (PSA) was established in 1997, and was the first PES program to be implemented on a national scale.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pagiola|first=Stefano|date=2008-05-01|title=Payments for environmental services in Costa Rica|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800907004235|journal=Ecological Economics|series=Payments for Environmental Services in Developing and Developed Countries|volume=65|issue=4|pages=712–724|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.07.033}}&lt;/ref&gt; It came on the back of Forestry Law 7575 of 1996 which prioritized environmental services over other forest activities such as timber production, and which established the national fund for forest financing (''Fondo Nacional de Financiamento Forestal),'' FONAFIFO.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ringhofer|first=Lisa|last2=Singh|first2=Simron J.|last3=Smetschka|first3=Barbara|year=2013|title=Climate Change Mitigation in Latin America: A Mapping of Current Policies, Plans and Programs|journal=Institute for Social Ecology|publisher=Alpen-Adria University, Vienna|volume=Working Paper 143|issn=1726-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PSA follows several years of different environmental programs in Costa Rica including the Forest Credit Certificate (''Certificado de Abono Forestal'', CAF) of 1986 and the Forest Protection Certificate (''Certificado para la Protección del Bosque,'' CPB) of 1995.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; One of the main reasons for establishing the PSA program was to reframe conservation subsidies as payments for services.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matulis|first=Brett Sylvester|date=2013-01-01|title=The narrowing gap between vision and execution: Neoliberalization of PES in Costa Rica|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718512001868|journal=Geoforum|series=Global Production Networks, Labour and Development|volume=44|pages=253–260|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2012.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It explicitly recognized four environmental services:  mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, hydrological services, biodiversity protection, and provision of scenic beauty.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; During the early years of the PSA program from 2001 to 2006, it was funded by a World Bank loan and a grant from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) under the project name "Ecomarkets."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; From 2007 to 2014, the World Bank renewed its support for the program through a new project called "Mainstreaming Market-Based Instruments for Environmental Management."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.projects.worldbank.org/P093384/mainstreaming-market-based-instruments-environmental-management-project?lang=en|title=Projects  : Mainstreaming Market-Based Instruments for Environmental Management Project {{!}} The World Bank|website=www.projects.worldbank.org|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This support also generated FONAFIFO's Sustainable Biodiversity Fund (FBS), designed to target PES programs at owners of small pieces of land, indigenous communities, and communities with low development rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fonafifo.go.cr/home/projects/fbs.html#HERMES_TABS_1_1|title=Sustainable Biodiversity Fund (FBS)|website=www.fonafifo.go.cr|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financing of PSA activities was initially accomplished in part through a fuel tax established by Forestry Law 7575. The tax was used to flexibly target ecologically important areas. In 2006 a water tariff was introduced to provide additional funding. The water tariff has a relatively narrow application when compared to the fuel tax. Under the water tariff, holders of water concessions pay fees, a portion of which is transferred for use in the PSA exclusively within the watershed in which the revenues were generated. This removes the potential for revenues to be distributed as needed and has been criticized for concentrating funding in select areas, despite their relatively low ecological importance.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

FONAFIFO acts as a semi-autonomous intermediary organization between service buyers and service sellers. As of 2004, FONAFIFO had contracted 11 different companies in agribusiness, hydropower, municipal water supply, and tourism to pay for the water services they receive. Since then, FONAFIFO has reached agreements with several more companies.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

By the end of 2005, 95% of land enrolled in Costa Rica's PSA was under forest conservation contracts, covering 10% of the country.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It is estimated that from the time the program began to 2005, forest cover area increased form 394,000 hectares to 2.45 million hectares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/WRI_Restoration_Diagnostic_Case_Example_Costa_Rica.pdf|title=The Restoration Diagnostic - Case Example: Costa Rica|last=Buckingham|first=Kathleen|last2=Hanson|first2=Craig|date=|website=www.wri.org|publisher=World Resources Institute|orig-year=2015|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also estimated that the PSA prevented 11 million tons of carbon emissions between 1999 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/env/cc/38523758.pdf|title=Incentives to Reduce GHG Emissions from Deforestation: Lessons Learned from Costa Rica and Mexico|last=Karousakis|first=Katia|date=|year=2007|website=www.oecd.org|publisher=Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these successes, the PSA has been criticized for critical shortcomings. As it stands, the PSA payment system employs a flat rate cash payment to all participating landowners. This has resulted in large swaths of ecologically high value areas being left unenrolled in the program due to associated higher opportunity costs for land-use change not being adequately compensated for by the flat rate payment scheme.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
[[File:22nd_meridian_Bolivia.png|thumb|Bolivia]]

==== Los Negros, Bolivia ====
The program in Los Negros, Bolivia is a small user-financed program of combined payments for watershed and biodiversity services started by local NGO Fundación Natura Bolivia in 2003.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asquith|first=Nigel M.|last2=Vargas|first2=Maria Teresa|last3=Wunder|first3=Sven|date=2008-05-01|title=Selling two environmental services: In-kind payments for bird habitat and watershed protection in Los Negros, Bolivia|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800907006076|journal=Ecological Economics|series=Payments for Environmental Services in Developing and Developed Countries|volume=65|issue=4|pages=675–684|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.12.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The target area of the program is the watershed in Los Negros valley servicing the town of Santa Rosa and other downhill towns. By August 2007, 2774 hectares of  native vegetation were enrolled in the program under 46 landowners.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Funding for the program was initially provided by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, before the Municipality of Pampagrande began making payments for the services&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; One of the program's most unique aspects is the landowners' specific request that they be paid in-kind with beehives. They claimed that they wanted their compensation to last beyond a simple cash transfer. Along with the beehives, payment recipients are able to receive training in apiculture. It also allowed for those who prefer cash to sell their hives.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

An organizational obstacle to the program is that some farmers fear that the scheme is just a way to dispossess them of their land. This was a major factor in deciding to be paid in-kind as it is perceived as less of an attempt at land appropriation. Natura is addressing this issue by maintaining a constant presence in the community and leveraging social networks to convince farmers of the program's benefits.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Another issue regards the service buyer of the program. The Municipality of Pampagrande has received some limited support from irrigators in contributing to the program payments. This structure essentially provides the environmental services to downstream users essentially free of charge. Natura is working to implement a strategy through which beneficiaries of environmental services will directly contribute to their maintenance.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Program evaluation has been impeded by two factors, namely a lack of baseline data and insufficient data as the program develops. These are important in order to establish the additionality of the program. This issue is not unique to Los Negros, however, as many programs suffer from a lack of sufficient monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== Honduras ====
In [[Jesús de Otoro]], [[Honduras]], the Cumes River is the town's main source of clean water. Coffee producers were dumping their waste into the river upstream, polluting the source and directly affecting the consumers downstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watershedmarkets.org/documents/Honduras_Jesus_de_Otoro.pdf|title=Honduras - Jesus de Otoro PASOLAC Initiative|publisher=watershedmarkets.org|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To solve this problem, the local Council for Administration of Water and Sewage Disposal (JAPOE) created a payment program to benefit coffee producers upstream and the town's inhabitants who lived downstream. The villagers downstream paid around $0.06 per household per month to JAPOE, who redirected the money toward the upstream farmers. The farmers complied with guidelines, such as construction of irrigation ditches, proper management of waste, and use of organic fertilizers.

Pico Bonito Forests, near [[La Ceiba]], Honduras, is a mission-driven, for-profit venture between the [[Pico Bonito]] National Park Foundation and the [[EcoLogic Development Fund]]. [[Carbon credits]] are generated by planting native trees to capture, or [[Carbon sequestration|sequester]], carbon dioxide. The credits are then sold though the World Bank's BioCarbon Fund to countries aiming to meet their [[carbon emissions]] reduction targets. The project offers a unique business model because it is owned jointly by investors and the communities near the park. Community members earn income and share profits from implementing the sustainable forestry practices that capture carbon. By 2017, the project is expected to sequester from .45-.55 Mt of carbon through [[reforestation]] and [[agroforestry]] and up to an additional .5 Mt of carbon through avoided [[deforestation]] as destructive practices are replaced with sustainable practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carbonfinance.org/Router.cfm?Page=BioCF&amp;FID=9708&amp;ItemID=9708&amp;ft=Projects&amp;ProjID=9637|title=Carbon Finance|date=|publisher=Carbon Finance|accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mexico ====
The Scolel Té program in [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]], aims to create a market for positive externalities of [[shade-grown coffee]] plantations. Designed by the [[University of Edinburgh]]'s Institute of Ecology and Resource Management along with the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Management, using the Plan Vivo System, Scolel Té is a PES program under which farmers agree to responsible farming and reforestation practices in exchange for payment for carbon offsets. The NGO Ambio manages Scolel Té. Farmers submit their reforestation plans to Ambio, which judges their financial benefits and the amount of carbon sequestration associated with each plan. The farmers then receive payments from the Fondo BioClimatico, managed by Ambio. Funding for the Fondo BioClimatico comes from the sale of [[Voluntary Emissions Reduction]] (VERs) to private groups at a price of $13 per ton of Carbon sequestered.

==== Hoima and Kibaale, Uganda ====
[[File:Ug-map.png|thumb|Uganda]]

The Hoima and Kibaale PES intervention took place from 2010 to 2013 and was especially unique because it was the first PES program set up specifically for a randomized control trial to empirically determine its impact on deforestation&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jayachandran|first=Seema|last2=de Laat|first2=Joost|last3=Lambin|first3=Eric F.|last4=Stanton|first4=Charlotte Y.|year=2016|title=Cash for Carbon: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Payments for Ecosystem Services to Reduce Deforestation|journal=Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA)|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/07/06/this-experiment-could-help-save-endangered-chimps-and-slow-global-warming-at-the-same-time/|title=A cheap, simple experiment just found a very effective way to slow deforestation|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the treatment villages, owners of forested land were paid $28 per year over the course of two years for every hectare of forest land that was left intact, with the possibility of additional payment for planting new trees. The payment scheme amounted to 5% of average annual income for the typical participating landowner.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The program evaluation found there to be significantly less deforestation in participating villages (2%-5%) than in control villages (7%-10%).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

It is important to note that the program did not carry on beyond the evaluation period, and it is assumed that previous forest practice will resume once landowners stop receiving program payments.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The '''Penrose triangle''', also known as the '''Penrose tribar,''' or the '''impossible tribar''',&lt;ref&gt;Pappas, T. "The Impossible Tribar." The Joy of Mathematics. San Carlos, CA: Wide World Publ./Tetra, p. 13, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; is a triangular [[impossible object]]. It was first created by the Swedish artist [[Oscar Reutersvärd]] in 1934. The psychiatrist [[Lionel Penrose]] and his [[mathematician]] son [[Roger Penrose]] independently devised and popularized it in the 1950s, describing it as "impossibility in its purest form". It is featured prominently in the works of artist [[M. C. Escher]], whose earlier depictions of impossible objects partly inspired it.

==Impossible object==
The tribar appears to be a [[solid]] object, made of three straight beams of square cross-section which meet pairwise at right angles at the vertices of the [[triangle]] they form. The beams may be broken, forming cubes or cuboids.

[[File:Perth Impossible Triangle.jpg|thumb|left|500px|Impossible triangle sculpture as an [[optical illusion]], East Perth, Western Australia]]
This combination of properties cannot be realized by any three-dimensional object in ordinary [[Euclidean space]].  Such an object can exist in certain Euclidean [[3-manifold]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Francis|first=George|title=A topological picturebook|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|year=1988|ISBN=0-387-96426-6}}  In the chapter on the Penrose tribar, Francis attributes this observation to [[John Stillwell]].&lt;/ref&gt;  There also exist three-dimensional solid shapes each of which, when viewed from a certain angle, appears the same as the 2-dimensional depiction of the Penrose triangle on this page (such as – for example – the adjacent image depicting a sculpture in [[Perth]], [[Australia]]).  The term "Penrose triangle" can refer to the 2-dimensional depiction or the impossible object itself.

[[M.C. Escher]]'s [[lithograph]] ''[[Waterfall (M. C. Escher)|Waterfall]]'' (1961) depicts a watercourse that flows in a zigzag along the long sides of two elongated Penrose triangles, so that it ends up two stories higher than it began. The resulting waterfall, forming the short sides of both triangles, drives a [[water wheel]]. Escher helpfully points out that in order to keep the wheel turning some water must occasionally be added to compensate for [[evaporation]].

[[Image:LargeTribarGotschuchenAustria.JPG|thumb|200px|Impossible Triangle sculpture, Gotschuchen, Austria]]
If a line is traced around the Penrose triangle, a 4-loop [[Möbius strip]] is formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gardner|first=Martin|title=Mathematical Games, August 1978 A Möbius band has a finite thickness, and so it is actually a twisted prism|publisher=SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, A DIVISION OF NATURE AMERICA, INC.|year=1978|}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Although the tribar is named one of the impossible objects, there exist many more that fit into the same category. Other impossible objects include the [[impossible trident|devil's fork]], the [http://brainden.com/images/elephant-big.gif dancing elephant], and [http://brainden.com/images/impossible-arch-big.jpg impossible arch].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BrainDen.com – Impossible Objects|url = http://brainden.com/impossible-objects.htm|website = BrainDen.com|access-date = 2016-02-09|first = Jan|last = Adamovic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Penrose polygons==
While it is possible to construct analogies to the Penrose triangle with other shapes and regular polygons to create a Penrose polygon, the visual effect is not as striking, and as the sides increase, the object seems merely to be warped or twisted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5500">'''Pointer jumping''' or '''path doubling''' is a [[Algorithm design|design technique]] for [[parallel algorithm]]s that operate on pointer structures, such as [[linked list]]s and [[directed graph]]s. It can be used to find the roots of a [[forest (graph theory)|forest]] of [[rooted tree]]s, and can also be applied to parallelize many other [[graph algorithm]]s including [[connected component (graph theory)|connected component]]s, [[minimum spanning trees]], and [[biconnected components]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite books |first=Joseph |last=JáJá |title=An Introduction to Parallel Algorithms |publisher=Addison Wesley |year=1992 |isbn=0-201-54856-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== List ranking ==

One of the simpler tasks that can be solved by a pointer jumping algorithm is the ''list ranking'' problem. This problem is defined as follows: given a linked list of {{mvar|N}} nodes, find the distance (measured in the number of nodes) of each node to the end of the list. The distance {{mono|d(n)}} is defined as follows, for nodes {{mono|n}} that point to their successor by a pointer called {{mono|next}}:

* If {{mono|n.next}} is [[Null pointer|{{mono|nil}}]], then {{mono|d(n) {{=}} 0}}.
* For any other node, {{mono|d(n) {{=}} d(n.next) + 1}}.

This problem can easily be solved in linear time on a sequential machine, but a parallel algorithm can do better: given {{mvar|n}} processors, the problem can be solved in [[logarithmic time]], {{math|''O''(log ''N'')}}, by the following pointer jumping algorithm:&lt;ref name="clrs"&gt;{{Introduction to Algorithms|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|693}}

&lt;div style="margin-left: 35px; width: 600px"&gt;
{{framebox|blue}}
* Allocate an array of {{mvar|N}} integers.
* Initialize: for each processor/list node {{mvar|n}}, in parallel:
** If {{mono|n.next {{=}} nil}}, set {{mono|d[n] ← 0}}.
** Else, set {{mono|d[n] ← 1}}.
* While any node {{mono|n}} has {{mono|n.next ≠ nil}}:
** For each processor/list node {{mvar|n}}, in parallel:
*** If {{mono|n.next ≠ nil}}:
**** Set {{mono|d[n] ← d[n] + d[n.next]}}.
**** Set {{mono|n.next ← n.next.next}}.
{{frame-footer}}
&lt;/div&gt;

The pointer jumping occurs in the last line of the algorithm, where each node's {{mono|next}} pointer is reset to skip the node's direct successor. It is assumed, as in common in the [[parallel random access machine|PRAM]] model of computation, that memory access are performed in lock-step, so that each {{mono|n.next.next}} memory fetch is performed before each {{mono|n.next}} memory store; otherwise, processors may clobber each other's data, producing inconsistencies.{{r|clrs}}{{rp|694}}

Analyzing the algorithm yields a logarithmic running time. The initialization loop takes constant time, because each of the {{mvar|N}} processors performs a constant amount of work, all in parallel. The inner loop of the main loop also takes constant time, as does (by assumption) the termination check for the loop, so the running time is determined by how often this inner loop is executed. Since the pointer jumping in each iteration splits the list into two parts, one consisting of the "odd" elements and one of the "even" elements, the length of the list pointed to by each processor's {{mono|n}} is halved in each iteration, which can be done at most  {{math|''O''(log ''N'')}} time before each list has a length of at most one.{{r|clrs}}{{rp|694–695}}

== Root finding ==

Following a [[path (graph theory)|path]] in a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is an inherently serial operation, but pointer jumping reduces the total amount of work by following all paths simultaneously and sharing results among dependent operations. Pointer jumping iterates and finds a ''successor'' — a [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] closer to the tree root — each time. By following successors computed for other vertices, the traversal down each path can be doubled every iteration, which means that the tree roots can be found in [[logarithmic time]].

Pointer doubling operates on an array &lt;tt&gt;successor&lt;/tt&gt; with an entry for every vertex in the graph. Each &lt;tt&gt;successor[''i'']&lt;/tt&gt; is initialized with the parent index of vertex &lt;tt&gt;''i''&lt;/tt&gt; if that vertex is not a root or to &lt;tt&gt;''i''&lt;/tt&gt; itself if that vertex is a root. At each iteration, each successor is updated to its successor's successor. The root is found when the successor's successor points to itself.

The following [[pseudocode]] demonstrates the algorithm.

 '''Input:''' An array parent representing a forest of trees. parent[i] is the parent of vertex i or itself for a root
 '''Output:''' An array containing the root ancestor for every vertex
 
 '''for''' ''i'' ← 1 '''to''' length(parent) '''do in parallel'''
     successor[''i''] ← parent[''i'']
 '''while''' true
     '''for''' ''i'' ← 1 '''to''' length(successor) '''do in parallel'''
        successor_next[''i''] ← successor[successor[''i'']]
    '''if''' successor_next = successor '''then'''
        break
     '''for''' ''i'' ← 1 '''to''' length(successor) '''do in parallel'''
        successor[''i''] ← successor_next[''i'']
 '''return''' successor

The following image provides an example of using pointer jumping on a small forest. On each iteration the successor points to the vertex following one more successor. After two iterations, every vertex points to its root node.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19963">'''Pollution prevention (P2)''' is a strategy for reducing the amount of waste created and released into the environment, particularly by industrial facilities, agriculture, or consumers. Many large corporations view P2 as a method of improving the efficiency and profitability of production processes by [[Waste minimisation|waste reduction]] and technology advancements.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-05-01|title=Cleaner production and profitability: analysis of 134 industrial pollution prevention (P2) project reports |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652604000071 |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |volume=13 |issue=6|pages=593–605|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2003.12.025|issn=0959-6526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislative bodies have enacted P2 measures, such as the [[Pollution Prevention Act of 1990]] and the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990]] by the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Freeman |first=Harry |last2=Harten |first2=Teresa |last3=Springer |first3=Johnny|last4=Randall|first4=Paul|last5=Curran|first5=Mary Ann|last6=Stone|first6=Kenneth|date=1992|title=Industrial Pollution Prevention!

== Background ==
[[File:Los Angeles Pollution.jpg|thumb|303x303px|The pollution in Los Angeles is very evident, prompting calls for pollution prevention strategies.]]

=== Significance ===
Pollution prevention is any action (large or small) that reduces the amount of contaminants released into the environment. By implementing P2 processes, fewer hazards will be posed to both public health and natural well being. Thus, P2 is a key method to preserving [[natural resource]]s. It can also have significant financial benefits in large scale processes.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/p2/learn-about-pollution-prevention |title=Learn About Pollution Prevention |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC |access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the long run, by implementing suggested P2 processes, large corporations may realize great benefits. If companies produce less waste, they do not have to worry about proper disposal. Thus, P2 is also a proactive measure to reduce costs of waste disposal and elimination.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt;

=== Sources ===
[[File:Port Auckland (373471767).jpg|thumb|Ships in port often have engines idling for days, releasing copious amounts of pollutants.]]
[[Port|Shipping ports]] are a significant source of pollution due to the heavy cargo traffic that these areas receive. The impact of these ships is quite widespread, affecting coastal communities and ecosystems across the globe. Most major shipping ports are located near environmentally sensitive [[Estuary|estuaries]]. These areas are particularly impacted by high levels of [[diesel exhaust]], [[Particulates|particulate matter]], [[nitrogen oxide]]s, [[ozone]], and [[sulfur oxide]]s. The solution for reducing port-related pollution is multi-fold, encompassing attainable alternatives and long-term reduction goals. Examples of simple steps include a restriction on engine idling for ships in the port and the use of cleaner grade diesel fuels. Some more expensive measures can be taken to mitigate the pollution of ships. Replacing older model ships with ships containing new engines allows the ships to meet modern emission standards. Exhaust systems can also be retrofitted in order to reduce exhaust emissions. Looking ahead into the future, there are a few technologies being developed. For example, plugging ships into “shore-side” power sources may eliminate the need for idling engines. Additionally, various sources of alternative fuel are being developed, the most significant of which is a [[fuel cell]] unit.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2004-10-01 |title=Pollution prevention at ports: clearing the air |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195925504000745 |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |volume=24 |issue=7-8 |pages=749–774 |doi=10.1016/j.eiar.2004.06.005 |issn=0195-9255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to increased trade, the emissions from ships are expected to become the second largest source of diesel particulate matter by 2020. One approach to reduction as set forth by the International Forum on Globalization (IFG) is to increase the amount of local trading, thereby reducing the number of miles that ships have to travel. Another approach regards the strategic placement of ports close to land transportation infrastructure (i.e. roads and railroads). Again, this reduces the number of miles that vehicles have to travel between the initial and final destinations. Railroads that reach all the way to ports are a significant way to produce less toxic pollutants, as this eliminates the need for less-efficient trucks to transport the goods from the coastal port to the inland railroad infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

=== Health Hazards ===
There are many health hazards associated with pollution that P2 strategies aim to mitigate. Long-term exposure to certain pollutants can cause cancer, heart disease, asthma, birth defects, and premature death.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Additionally, excessive pollution to water sources can be detrimental to the [[biodiversity]] present in different areas around the globe.

== U.S. Legislation ==
=== Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 ===
In order to enforce some of the notions of P2, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Pollution Prevention Act of 1990]]. Congress declared that pollution should be prevented and reduced wherever possible; in addition, any waste that must be released into the environment must be done in a responsible, environmentally-conscious manner. The law requires the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to:
* create effective policies
* establish a standard form of measurement of P2
* establish a network and advisory board among EPA offices to coordinate the prevention initiatives and data collection
* create a training program to be distributed to EPA offices
* identify aspects of policies that can be presented to and enforced by Congress
* create a model of source reduction that can be used to teach interested industries of P2 opportunities
* integrate a reward program to encourage companies to comply with regulations.

In order to enforce the points outlined in the Act, EPA is directed to present a report to Congress biennially. Another aspect of the report required that companies fill out a toxic chemical release form allowing EPA to collect information on the levels of pollution released into the environment.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt;

=== Clean Air Act ===
The [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990]] provided many P2 strategies, including governmental intervention, research and development programs, guidelines for efficient technologies, reduction of vehicle emissions, and a suggested Congressional status report.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt;

=== 2010-2014 Pollution Prevention Program Strategic Plan ===
The EPA ''2010-2014 Pollution Prevention Program Strategic Plan'' introduced a number of ways to reduce harmful industrial outputs (i.e. [[greenhouse gas]]es, hazardous materials) while conserving natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/p2/pollution-prevention-law-and-policies |title=Pollution Prevention Law and Policies |publisher=EPA |access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production techniques==
As an environmental management strategy, P2 shares many attributes with [[cleaner production]], a term used more commonly outside the [[United States]]. Pollution prevention encompasses more specialized sub-disciplines including [[green chemistry]] and [[Sustainable design|green design]] (also known as environmentally conscious design).

== Pollution Prevention in Industrial Processes ==
[[File:Truck load of ponderosa pine, Edward Hines Lumber Co, operations in Malheur National Forest, Grant County, Oregon, July 1942.jpg|thumb|Lumber is an example of a raw material that can be saved through implementation of pollution prevention processes.]]
The possibilities of P2 strategies are still being implemented at the corporate level, but benefits are already being realized by many companies. Recently, the view of P2 in industrial businesses has shifted from one of necessity to one of strategic advantage. If companies invest in P2 methods early in their development, they realize greater gains not too far down the road.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; Additionally, if companies do not produce waste, they do not have to worry about properly disposing of it. Thus, P2 is a proactive measure taken to reduce costs in the long run that would have been dedicated to disposal and elimination of waste.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt;

There are two main ways to reduce waste through P2: waste reduction and technology improvements. Waste reduction at the source implies the same amount of input raw materials with less waste and more output of the product. Technology improvements imply changes to the production process that reduce the amount of output waste, such as an improved [[recycling]] process. Companies are moving past simply complying with the minimum environmental requirements, and they are taking a more strategic, forward-thinking stance on tackling the issue. However, the advancements in technology are still limited, implying that P2 techniques are still in the early stages of formation. The most profitable strategy is “in-process recycling.” Though it is not the most efficient form of “reduction at the source,” recycling is very profitable due to its ease of process. By engaging in recycling practices, industries not only cut down on the amount of material discarded as environmentally-hazardous waste, but they also increase profitability by reducing the amount of [[raw material]] purchased. The most widespread strategy is “reduction at the source,” which is the idea that byproducts of production can be reduced through efficient and careful use of natural resources. This method reduces the amount of dangerous pollutants present in waste before the waste is released. In turn, this creates a safer environment free of hazardous waste. This idea ties strongly into the benefits to corporations of investing in newer, more efficient technology.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Pollution Prevention Strategies ==

=== P2 Task Force ===
In order to reduce costs of P2 techniques, many officials are turning to pollution elimination strategies, thereby eliminating any need for end-of-pipe solutions. A task force was created by the EPA in order to directly target reduction strategies. The P2 program task force has 5 main goals:

# create feasible P2 objectives and corresponding time frames
# provide training to the individuals involved in the effort
# oversee the program's main tasks and measure progress
# evaluate the progress of the effort
# maintain the program's goals long term&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2008-01-15 |title=Sustainable development of process facilities: State-of-the-art review of pollution prevention frameworks |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438940701237X |journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials |volume=150 |issue=1 |pages=4–20 |doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.08.062 |issn=0304-3894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voluntary Approach ===
Voluntary approaches to P2 are on the rise. Governmental organization often collaborate with businesses and regulatory agencies to create a structure of guidelines. There are four types of voluntary approach programs: public voluntary programs, negotiated agreements, unilateral commitments, and private agreements. Public voluntary agreements are the least restrictive. Environmental authorities collaborate and create specific guidelines. Companies are then invited to follow these procedures on a strictly voluntary basis. Negotiated agreements are created through collaboration between public authorities and industry authorities. The agreement establishes bargains that are beneficial to the industry. Unilateral commitments are established by industry authorities alone, and the guidelines they set are [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulated]]. Private agreements are established between “polluters” and other affected parties. The regulations set forth create a compromise regarding a variety of pollution regulation strategies. The United States mainly follows the end-of-pipe prevention strategy. However, US President [[Richard Nixon]] created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970, and one of its principal missions was to regulate pollution. EPA’s implementation of policies is almost entirely voluntary.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2011-03-01 |title=A review of international practice in the design of voluntary Pollution Prevention Programs |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652610001150 |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=542–551 |doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.03.015 |issn=0959-6526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a few keys to a successful voluntary approach. First, the program needs a dependable source of funding (from the government, usually). The program also needs a dynamic relationship with the targeted industries. This creates a base of trust between all involved in the agreement. In terms of regulation, the program should be monitored by a reliable source. In order to assure that the program will establish itself long term, there should be visible benefits to the participants and obvious results to the greater community. The long-term establishment of the program also comes from setting attainable goals to measure progress.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Governmental Approach ===
EPA has published waste minimization guidelines that comprise 5 major steps:
# organizing the primary task force
# assessing the current pollution situation
# evaluating the feasibility of different program options
# reporting and planning the preparations based upon the analysis
# implementing the program.

This framework mainly benefits smaller facilities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Waste Reduction Approach ===
The Waste Reduction Algorithm (WRA) is used to quantitatively describe the benefits of different P2 strategies based on each unique facility. The WRA tracks pollutants through the entire production process in order to obtain accurate measurements.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Industrial Efforts ===
By maximizing P2 opportunities, some companies choose to redesign their entire industrial process. Managers focus more on what enters and moves through the entire process, instead of only focusing on the output. Overall, the P2 strategies that financially benefit companies are the most likely to be implemented. However, since P2 has only recently been realized as a cost benefit, many corporations have not adopted significant measures to realize the potential gain.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lober |first=Douglas J. |date=1998 |title=Pollution prevention as corporate entrepreneurship |url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/09534819810369554 |journal=Journal of Organizational Change Management |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=26–37 |doi=10.1108/09534819810369554 |issn=0953-4814|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Potential Benefits ====
Pollution prevention can also be viewed as a form of environmental entrepreneurship, as companies are increasingly concerned with the cost benefits of reducing the amount of waste created. For example, [[3M]] has accrued a savings of over $750 million since 1973 due to their implementation of P2 incentives. If implemented correctly, P2 strategies can result in an increase in yield, a commonly sought after result of industrial processes. Pollution prevention can also reduce the cost of waste removal because of the reduces amount of waste to remove. By preventing the amount of pollution released, companies can avoid some of the liability costs imposed when large amounts of pollution are released and contaminate the land on which the facility is located.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Individual Efforts ===
[[File:Senate Energy-efficient Lighting (28475055803).jpg|thumb|Installing energy efficient lighting and appliances are a relatively cheap way to reduce pollution on a smaller scale.]]
According to EPA, there are some everyday steps that can be taken to prevent pollution:

* Use paper in limited quantities, and print double-sided. Also, look for paper that has been made with recycled materials.
* When shopping, buy in bulk in order to reduce the amount of packaging required to package the goods. Look for products made with recycled materials. Bring reusable bags in which to carry purchased goods in order to reduce the number of disposed paper/plastic bags.
* Use water sparingly by installing water-efficient shower heads and faucets, and install [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient appliances]]. Make sure that sinks and hoses are not dripping. Do not excessively water plants.
* Use transportation efficiently, and utilize mass transportation when possible. Recycling used motor oil is also a way to eliminate the disposal of a hazardous material.
* Eating locally produced foods reduces the amount of fuel required for the food's transportation.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

Additional examples of P2 include using energy efficient machinery, developing clean-burning fuel, reducing the amount of chemicals released into water sources, creating a production process that results in a reduced amount of waste, and utilizing water conservation techniques.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7632">In [[philosophy]], '''practical reason''' is the use of [[reason]] to decide how to [[philosophy of action|act]]. It contrasts with theoretical reason, often called [[speculative reason]], the use of reason to decide what to follow. For example, agents use practical reason to decide whether to build a [[telescope]], but theoretical reason to decide which of two theories of light and [[optics]] is the best.

==Overview==
Practical reason is understood by most philosophers as determining a plan of action. [[Thomism|Thomistic]] ethics defines the first principle of practical reason as "good is to be done and pursued, and evil is to be avoided."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2094.htm#article2 ''Summa Theologiæ'', I-IIª q. 94 a. 2] co.&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], practical reason has a law-abiding quality because the [[categorical imperative]] is understood to be binding one to one's duty rather than subjective preferences. [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarians]] tend to see reason as an instrument for the satisfactions of wants and needs.

In classical philosophical terms, it is very important to distinguish three domains of human activity: theoretical reason, which investigates the truth of [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] events as well as [[Logical truth|necessary truths]]; practical reason, which determines whether a prospective course of action is worth pursuing; and productive or technical reason, which attempts to find the best means for a given end. Aristotle viewed philosophical activity as the highest activity of the human being and gave pride of place to metaphysics or wisdom. Since Descartes, practical judgment and reasoning have been treated with less respect because of the demand for greater certainty and an infallible method to justify beliefs.

In [[cognitive]] research, practical reason is the process of ignoring unproductive possibilities in favor of productive possibilities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  It is considered a form of [[cognitive bias]], because it is illogical.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  An example would be calling all hospitals to look for your missing child, but not checking morgues, as finding his corpse would be 'counter-productive.'

== In argumentation ==

Practical reasoning is basically goal-directed reasoning from an agent's goal, and from some action selected as a means to carry out the goal, to the agent's reasoned decision to carry out the action. The agent can be a person or a technical device, such as a robot or  a software device for multi-agent communications. It is a type of reasoning used all the time in everyday life and all kinds of technology where autonomous reasoning is required. [[Argumentation theory|Argumentation theorist]]s have identified two kinds of practical reasoning: ''instrumental practical reasoning'' that does not explicitly take values into account,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walton|first1=Douglas|authorlink1=Doug Walton|last2=Reed|first2=Chris|last3=Macagno|first3=Fabrizio|title=Argumentation Schemes|date=2008|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=New York|pages=94–95|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''value-based practical reasoning''.&lt;ref name="Atkinson2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atkinson|first1=Katie|last2=Bench-Capon|first2=Trevor|last3=McBurney|first3=Peter|title=A Dialogue Game Protocol for Multi-Agent Argument over Proposals for Action|journal=[[Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems]]|date=2005|volume=11|issue=2|pages=153–71|doi=10.1007/s10458-005-1166-x|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following argumentation scheme for instrumental practical reasoning is given in {{harvtxt|Walton|Reed|Macagno|2008}}. The pronoun ''I'' represents an autonomous agent.

===Argumentation scheme for instrumental practical reasoning===
{|
|-
| MAJOR PREMISE:|| I have a goal G.
|-
| MINOR PREMISE:|| Carrying out this action A is a means to realize G.
|-
| CONCLUSION:|| Therefore, I ought (practically speaking) to carry out this action A.
|}

'''Critical questions'''

:CQ1: What other goals do I have that should be considered that might conflict with G?
:CQ2: What alternative actions to my bringing about A that would also bring about G should be considered?
:CQ3: Among bringing about A and these alternative actions, which is arguably the most efficient?
:CQ4: What grounds are there for arguing that it is practically possible for me to bring about A?
:CQ5: What consequences of my bringing about A should also be taken into account?

It can be seen from CQ5  that argumentation from consequences is closely related to the scheme for practical reasoning.
It has often been disputed in philosophy whether practical reasoning is purely instrumental or whether it needs to be based on values. Argument from values is combined with practical reasoning in the type of argumentation called value-based practical reasoning.&lt;ref name="Atkinson2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atkinson|first1=Katie|last2=Bench-Capon|first2=Trevor|last3=McBurney|first3=Peter|title=Computational Representation of Practical Argument|journal=[[Synthese]]|date=2006|volume=152|pages=157–206.|doi=10.1007/s11229-005-3488-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macagno|first1=Fabrizio|last2=Walton|first2=Douglas|authorlink2=Doug Walton|title=Persuasive Definitions: Values, Meanings and Implicit Disagreements|journal=Informal Logic|date=2008|volume=28|issue=3|pages=203–28|url=http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/article/viewArticle/594}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following argumentation scheme for value-based practical reasoning is given in {{harvtxt|Atkinson|Bench-Capon|McBurney|2005|pp=2–3}}.

===Argumentation scheme for value-based practical reasoning===

:In the current circumstances R

Practical reasoning is used in arguments, but also in explanations used to draw conclusions about an agent's goals, motives or intentions, based on reports of what the agent said or did.

Practical reasoning is centrally important in artificial intelligence, and also vitally important in many other fields such as law, medicine and engineering. It has been known as a distinctive type of argumentation as far back as Aristotle.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3784">'''Prohairesis''' ({{lang-grc|προαίρεσις}}; variously translated as "moral character", "will", "volition", "choice", "intention", or "moral choice"&lt;ref&gt;Keith Seddon, ''Epictetus' Handbook'', p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;) is a fundamental concept in the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy of [[Epictetus]]. It represents the choice involved in giving or withholding assent to impressions ([[Phantasia (philosophy)|phantasiai]]). The use of this Greek word was first introduced into philosophy by [[Aristotle]] in the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain C.: "The meaning of ''Prohairesis'' in Aristotele's Ethics" in ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' 114 (1984) 147-157&lt;/ref&gt; To Epictetus, it is the faculty that distinguishes human beings from all other creatures. The concept of prohairesis plays a cardinal role in the ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]]'' and in the ''[[Enchiridion of Epictetus|Manual]]'': the terms "prohairesis", "prohairetic", and "aprohairetic" appear some 168 times.&lt;ref&gt;Cassanmagnago C.: "Il problema della ''prohairesis'' in Epitteto" in ''Rivista di Filosofia Neoscolastica'' LXIX, 232-246 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dobbin R.: "''Prohairesis'' in Epictetus" in ''Ancient Philosophy'' XI, 111-135 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation by Epictetus==
According to Epictetus, nothing is properly considered either good, or bad, aside from those things that are within our own power to control, and the only thing fully in our power to control is our own volition (prohairesis) which exercises the faculty of choice that we use to judge our impressions. For example, if a person says something critical to us, that is not bad; or, if something complimentary is said, that is not good, because such things are externals and not in our power to control. By exerting the power of choice, it is possible to maintain [[equanimity]] in the face of either criticism and praise, which is a moral good. On the other hand, when people become troubled by criticism, or elated by praise, that is a moral evil because they have misjudged impressions by thinking that things not in their power (such as criticism or praise) have value, and by doing that they place a measure of control of their own life in the hands of others.&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', p. 114-5&lt;/ref&gt; 

The importance of prohairesis for Epictetus is that it exerts a power that allows people to choose how they will react to impressions rationally:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Remember that what is insulting is not the person who abuses or hits you, but the judgment that these things are insulting. So when someone irritates you, realize that it is your own opinion that has irritated you. Try, therefore, in the first place, not to be carried away by the impression; for if you once gain time and respite, you will find it easier to control yourself.&lt;ref&gt; ''The Handbook of Epictetus'' 20.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

By exerting their prohairesis (will, volition, or choice), people can choose rationally how to react to impressions. Prohairesis is the faculty that distinguishes human beings from all other creatures. Epictetus defines it as:
#a rational faculty able to use the impressions and to which all other human faculties are subordinated (e.g., ''Discourses'' II.23.6-15; II.23.20-29)
#a faculty capable of using impressions and understanding their use (e.g., ''Discourses'' II.8.4-8) 
#a self-theoretical faculty able to evaluate all other human faculties (e.g., ''Discourses'' I.1.1-13; I.17.1-3; I.20.1-6)
#a faculty impossible to be enslaved (e.g., ''Discourses'' II.10.1; I.17.21) and impossible to subordinate (e.g., ''Discourses'' II.10.1; I.17.21; IV.1.161)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1927">In [[mathematical logic]], a '''propositional variable''' (also called a '''sentential variable''' or '''sentential letter''') is a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] which can either be '''true''' or '''false'''. Propositional variables are the basic building-blocks of [[propositional formula]]s, used in [[propositional logic]] and higher logics.
==Uses==
Formulas in logic are typically built up recursively from some propositional variables, some number of [[logical connective]]s, and some [[logical quantifier]]s.  Propositional variables are the [[atomic formula]]s of propositional logic. 

;Example
In a given propositional logic, we might define a formula as follows:

*Every propositional variable is a formula.
*Given a formula ''X'' the [[negation]] ''¬X'' is a formula.
*Given two formulas ''X'' and ''Y'', and a [[binary connective]] ''b'' (such as the [[logical conjunction]] ∧), then ''(X b Y)'' is a formula. (Note the parentheses.)

In this way, all of the formulas of propositional logic are built up from propositional variables as a basic unit. Propositional variables should not be confused with the [[metavariable]]s which appear in the [[Propositional_logic#Example_1._Simple_axiom_system|typical axioms of propositional calculus]]; the latter effectively range over well-formed formulae.

==In first order logic==
Propositional variables are represented as nullary [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] in [[first order logic]].

In mathematics, and especially [[topology]], a '''Pytkeev space''' is a [[topological space]] that satisfies qualities more subtle than a [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence]] of a [[sequence]]. They are named after E. G. Pytkeev, who proved in 1983 that [[sequential space]]s have this property.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
 | last = Pytkeev | first = E. G.
 | journal = Trudy Matematicheskogo Instituta imeni V. A. Steklova
 | mr = 733840
 | pages = 209–213
 | title = Maximally decomposable spaces
 | volume = 154
 | year = 1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==

Let ''X'' be a topological space. For a subset ''S'' of ''X'' let &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline;"&gt;''S''&lt;/span&gt; denote the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of ''S''. Then a point ''x'' is called a ''Pytkeev point'' if for every set A with {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∈ &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline;"&gt;''A'' \ {''x''}&lt;/span&gt;}}, there is a countable &lt;math&gt; \pi &lt;/math&gt;-net of infinite subsets of ''A''.  A ''Pytkeev space'' is a space in which every point is a Pytkeev point.&lt;ref name="TAIA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malykhin|first=V. I.|last2=Tironi|first2=G|year=2000|title=Weakly Fréchet–Urysohn and Pytkeev spaces|journal=Topology and its Applications|volume=104|issue=2|pages=181–190|doi=10.1016/s0166-8641(99)00027-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

* Every [[sequential space]] is also a Pytkeev space. This is because, if {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∈ &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline;"&gt;''A'' \ {''x''}&lt;/span&gt;}} then there exists a sequence {''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''} that converges to ''x''. So take the countable π-net of infinite subsets of ''A'' to be {{nowrap|1={''A&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''} = {''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+2&lt;/sub&gt;, …}}}.&lt;ref name="TAIA"/&gt;
* If ''X'' is a Pytkeev space, then it is also a [[Weakly Fréchet–Urysohn space]].

'''Redshift-space distortions''' are an effect in [[observational cosmology]] where the spatial distribution of galaxies appears squashed and distorted when their positions are plotted in redshift-space (i.e. as a function of their [[redshift]]) rather than in real-space (as a function of their actual distance). The effect is due to the [[Peculiar velocity|peculiar velocities]] of the galaxies causing a [[Doppler shift]] in addition to the redshift caused by the [[Expansion of space|cosmological expansion]].

Redshift-space distortions (RSDs) manifest in two particular ways. The '''Fingers of God''' effect is where the galaxy distribution is elongated in redshift space, with an axis of elongation pointed toward the observer.&lt;ref name="Jackson 1972"&gt;Jackson, J.C. (1972).  "A critique of Rees's theory of primordial gravitational radiation".  ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]'', 156, 1P-6P.&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by a Doppler shift associated with the random peculiar velocities of galaxies bound in structures such as clusters. The large velocities that lead to this effect are associated with the [[gravity]] of the cluster by means of the [[virial theorem]]; they change the observed redshifts of the galaxies in the cluster. The deviation from the [[Hubble's law]] relationship between distance and redshift is altered, and this leads to inaccurate distance measurements.

Another, closely related effect is the '''Kaiser effect'''.&lt;ref name="Kaiser 1987"&gt;Kaiser, N. (1987).  "Clustering in real space and in redshift space".  ''Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society'', 227, 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt; This time, the distortion is caused by the coherent motions of galaxies as they fall inwards towards the cluster center as the cluster assembles. Depending on the particular dynamics of the situation, the Kaiser effect usually leads not to an elongation, but an apparent flattening ("pancakes of God"), of the structure. It is a much smaller effect than the fingers of God, and can be distinguished by the fact that it occurs on larger scales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://astron.berkeley.edu/~louis/astro228/redshift.html Cosmology Presentation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous effects are a result of special relativity, and have been observed in real data. There are additional effects that come directly from general relativity. One is called '''gravitational redshift distortion'''.&lt;ref name="McDonald 2009"&gt;McDonald, P. (2009). "Gravitational redshift and other redshift-space distortions of the imaginary part of the power spectrum"  ''Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics'', 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Gravitational redshift distortion comes about from the net [[gravitational redshift]], or blueshift, that is acquired when the photon climbs out of the gravitational potential well of the distant galaxy and then falls into the potential well of the Milky Way galaxy. This effect will make galaxies at a higher gravitational potential than Earth appear slightly closer (generically: less massive galaxies), and galaxies at lower potential will appear farther away (more massive galaxies and near [[galaxy cluster]]s).

The other effects of general relativity on clustering statistics are observed when the light from a background galaxy passes near, or through, a closer galaxy or cluster. These two effects go by the names '''integrated [[Sachs-Wolfe effect]]''' (ISW) and '''[[gravitational lens]]ing'''.&lt;ref name="Yoo 2009"&gt;Yoo, J. (2009). "Complete treatment of galaxy two-point statistics: Gravitational lensing effects and redshift-space distortions"  ''Physical Review D'', 79, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; For ISW, when a photon passes through a low area of gravitational potential it is 'protected' from the cosmological expansion of space, making the background galaxy appear closer. Gravitational lensing, unlike all of the previous effects, distorts the apparent position, and number, of background galaxies.

The RSDs measured in [[Redshift survey|galaxy redshift surveys]] can be used as a cosmological probe in their own right, providing information on how structure formed in the Universe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Percival|first1=Will J.|last2=White|first2=Martin|title=Testing cosmological structure formation using redshift-space distortions|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=11 February 2009|volume=393|issue=1|pages=297–308|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.14211.x|arxiv = 0808.0003 |bibcode = 2009MNRAS.393..297P }}&lt;/ref&gt; and how gravity behaves on large scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raccanelli|first1=A.|last2=Bertacca|first2=D.|last3=Pietrobon|first3=D.|last4=Schmidt|first4=F.|last5=Samushia|first5=L.|last6=Bartolo|first6=N.|last7=Dore|first7=O.|last8=Matarrese|first8=S.|last9=Percival|first9=W.

'''Relativistic dynamics''' refers to a combination of [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] and [[quantum]] concepts to describe the relationships between the motion and properties of a relativistic system and the forces acting on the system. What distinguishes relativistic dynamics from other physical theories is the use of an [[Scale invariance|invariant scalar]] evolution parameter to monitor the historical evolution of [[space-time]] events. In a scale-invariant theory, the strength of particle interactions does not depend on the energy of the particles involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/13/12/2049|title=Information Theory Consequences of the Scale-Invariance of Schröedinger’s Equation|authors=Silvana Flego, Angelo Plastino, and Angel Ricardo Plastino|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Twentieth century experiments showed that the physical description of [[microscopic]] and [[submicroscopic]] objects moving at or near the [[speed of light]] raised questions about such fundamental concepts as space, time, mass, and energy. The theoretical description of the physical phenomena required the integration of concepts from relativity and [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].

[[Vladimir Fock]] &lt;ref&gt;Fock, V.A. (1937): Phys. Z. Sowjetunion 12, 404.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to propose an evolution parameter theory for describing relativistic quantum phenomena, but the evolution parameter theory introduced by [[Ernst Stueckelberg]] &lt;ref&gt;Stueckelberg, E.C.G. (1941): Helv. Phys. Acta 14, 322, 588.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stueckelberg, E.C.G. (1942): Helv. Phys. Acta 14, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; is more closely aligned with recent work.&lt;ref&gt;Fanchi, J.R. (1993): Found. Phys. 23, 487.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fanchi, J.R. (2003): “The Relativistic Quantum Potential and Non-Locality,” published in '''Horizons in World Physics''', 240, Edited by Albert Reimer, ([[Nova Science Publishers]], Hauppauge, New York), pp 117-159.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution parameter theories were used by [[Feynman]],&lt;ref&gt;Feynman, R.P. (1950): Phys. Rev. 80, 440.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]] &lt;ref&gt;Schwinger, J. (1951): Phys. Rev. 82, 664 and 914.&lt;/ref&gt; and others to formulate quantum field theory in the late 1940s and early 1950s. [[Silvan S. Schweber]] &lt;ref&gt;Schweber, S.S. (1986): Rev. Mod. Phys. 58, 449.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a nice historical exposition of Feynman’s investigation of such a theory. A resurgence of interest in evolution parameter theories began in the 1970s with the work of Horwitz and [[Constantin Piron|Piron]],&lt;ref&gt;Horwitz, L.P. and C. Piron (1973): Helv. Phys. Acta 46, 316.&lt;/ref&gt; and Fanchi and Collins.&lt;ref&gt;Fanchi, J.R. and R.E. Collins (1978): Found. Phys. 8, 851.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Invariant Evolution Parameter Concept ==

Some researchers view the evolution parameter as a mathematical artifact while others view the parameter as a physically measurable quantity. To understand the role of an evolution parameter and the fundamental difference between the standard theory and evolution parameter theories, it is necessary to review the concept of time. 

Time t played the role of a monotonically increasing evolution parameter in classical Newtonian mechanics, as in the force law F = dP/dt for a non-relativistic, classical object with momentum P. To Newton, time was an “arrow” that parameterized the direction of evolution of a system. 

[[Einstein]] rejected the [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] concept and identified t as the fourth coordinate of a space-time four-[[vector (geometric)|vector]]. Einstein's view of time requires a physical equivalence between coordinate time and coordinate space. In this view, time should be a reversible coordinate in the same manner as space. Particles moving backward in time are often used to display [[antiparticles]] in Feynman-diagrams, but they are not thought of as really moving backward in time usually it is done to simplify notation. However a lot of people think they are really moving backward in time and take it as evidence for time reversibility.

The development of non-relativistic [[quantum mechanics]] in the early twentieth century preserved the Newtonian concept of time in the Schrödinger equation. The ability of non-relativistic quantum mechanics and special relativity to successfully describe observations motivated efforts to extend quantum concepts to the relativistic domain. Physicists had to decide what role time should play in relativistic quantum theory. The role of time was a key difference between Einsteinian and Newtonian views of classical theory. Two hypotheses that were consistent with [[special relativity]] were possible:

===Hypothesis I===
Assume t = Einsteinian time and reject Newtonian time.

===Hypothesis II===
Introduce two temporal variables: 
*A coordinate time in the sense of Einstein
*An invariant evolution parameter in the sense of Newton

''Hypothesis I'' led to a relativistic probability conservation equation that is essentially a re-statement of the non-relativistic continuity equation. Time in the relativistic probability conservation equation is Einstein’s time and is a consequence of implicitly adopting ''Hypothesis I''. By adopting ''Hypothesis I'', the standard paradigm has at its foundation a temporal paradox: motion relative to a single temporal variable must be reversible even though the second law of [[thermodynamics]] establishes an “arrow of time” for evolving systems, including relativistic systems. Thus, even though Einstein’s time is reversible in the standard theory, the evolution of a system is not time reversal invariant. From the perspective of ''Hypothesis I'', time must be both an irreversible arrow tied to entropy and a reversible coordinate in the Einsteinian sense.&lt;ref&gt;Horwitz, L.P., S. Shashoua and W.C. Schieve (1989): Physica A 161, 300.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of relativistic dynamics is motivated in part by the concern that ''Hypothesis I'' was too restrictive.

The problems associated with the standard formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics provide a clue to the validity of ''Hypothesis I''. These problems included negative probabilities, hole theory, the [[Klein paradox]], non-covariant expectation values, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Fanchi, J.R. (1993): '''Parametrized Relativistic Quantum Theory''' (Kluwer, Dordrecht)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, S. (1995): '''Quantum Theory of Fields''', Volume I (Cambridge University Press, New York).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prugovećki, E. (1995): Found. Phys. 24, 335.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these problems were never solved; they were avoided when [[quantum field theory]] (QFT) was adopted as the standard paradigm. The QFT perspective, particularly its formulation by Schwinger, is a subset of the more general Relativistic Dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Fanchi, J.R. (1979): Phys. Rev. D 20, 2108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fanchi, J.R. (1993): '''Parametrized Relativistic Quantum Theory''' (Kluwer, Dordrecht)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pavsič, M. (1991): Found. Phys. 21, 1005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Pavsič, M. (1991): Nuovo Cim. A 104, 1337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pavsič, M. (2001): Found. Phys. 31, 1185 [hep-th/0011216].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pavsič, M. (2001): '''The Landscape of Theoretical Physics: A Global View''' (Kluwer, Dordrecht).&lt;/ref&gt;

Relativistic Dynamics is based on ''Hypothesis II'' and employs two temporal variables: a coordinate time, and an evolution parameter. The evolution parameter, or parameterized time, may be viewed as a physically measurable quantity, and a procedure has been presented for designing evolution parameter clocks.&lt;ref&gt;Fanchi, J.R. (1986): Phys. Rev. A 34, 1677.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fanchi, J.R. (1993): '''Parametrized Relativistic Quantum Theory''' (Kluwer, Dordrecht)&lt;/ref&gt; By recognizing the existence of a distinct parameterized time and a distinct coordinate time, the conflict between a universal direction of time and a time that may proceed as readily from future to past as from past to future is resolved. The distinction between parameterized time and coordinate time removes ambiguities in the properties associated with the two temporal concepts in Relativistic Dynamics.

'''Robert The''' is a [[New York City]] artist known for his Gun Books and other sculptures made primarily of books.

== Career ==

The's work has been exhibited in notable museums in the US and internationally. According to the [[Chicago Reader]], ''"The is reluctant to betray his trade secrets, saying only that he uses a power saw. Paper is harder to cut than wood', he says"''. Each year ''"he cranks out hundreds of pieces--every one is different"''.  The's book guns have been collected, writes the Chicago Reader, in the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in [[Los Angeles]], and the [[Walker Art Center]] in [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref name=ChicagoReader&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/on-exhibitloaded-words/Content?oid=893423 | title=Chicago Reader | publisher=chicagoreader.com | work=On Exhibit:loaded words | date=May 15, 1997 | accessdate=November 14, 2011 | author=huebner, Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

The [[New York Times]], discussing the future of physical books, wrote that "creative uses for books that do not involve engaging with words on a page already abound", and instances The's books cut "into gun shapes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/magazine/08fob-consumed-t.html?scp=1&amp;sq=%22Robert%20The%22%20gun%20book&amp;st=cse | title=New York Times | publisher=nytimes.com | work=Creative New Uses for Books | date=August 6, 2010 | accessdate=November 14, 2011 | author=Walker, Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Chicago Reader, The "owns up to [the book guns'] sensational aspect", and says he "still gets complaints", the majority (in The's words) "from leftists".&lt;ref name=ChicagoReader /&gt;

GreenMuze writes that "Bookguns by American artist Robert The, are used books that are artfully cut into gun-like shapes. Each book is carefully selected to create a play-on-words or add an ironic dimension to his recycled artwork." Book titles include Salinger's [[Catcher in the Rye]], McLuhan's [[The Medium is the Massage]] and the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greenmuze.com/art/artists/3366-recycled-book-guns.html | title=GreenMuze | publisher=greenmuze.com | work=Recycled Book Guns | date=December 18, 2010 | accessdate=November 14, 2011 | author="Greenmuze staff"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11333">A '''runoff model''' is  a mathematical model describing the [[rainfall]]'''&amp;ndash;'''[[Surface runoff|runoff]] relations of a rainfall ''catchment area'', [[drainage basin]] or ''watershed''. More precisely, it produces a surface runoff [[hydrograph]] in response to a rainfall event, represented by and input as a [[hyetograph]]. In other words, the model calculates the conversion of rainfall into runoff.&lt;br&gt;
A well known runoff model is the ''linear reservoir'', but in practice it has limited applicability.&lt;br&gt;
The runoff model with a ''non-linear reservoir'' is more universally applicable, but still it holds only for catchments whose surface area is limited by the condition that the rainfall can be considered more or less uniformly distributed over the area. The maximum size of the watershed then depends on the rainfall characteristics of the region.  When the study area is too large, it can be divided into sub-catchments and the various runoff hydrographs may be combined using [[Routing (hydrology)|flood routing]] techniques.&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Water cycle.png|thumb|300px]]
Rainfall-runoff models need to be [[calibration|calibrated]] before they can be used.

==Linear reservoir==
[[File:Drainage_basin.png|thumb|200px|A watershed or drainage basin]]
[[File:LinReserv.svg|thumb|150px|Figure 1. A linear reservoir]]
The hydrology of a linear reservoir (figure 1) is governed by two equations.&lt;ref&gt;J.W. de Zeeuw, 1973. ''Hydrograph analysis for areas with mainly groundwater runoff''. In: Drainage Principle and Applications, Vol. II, Chapter 16, Theories of field drainage and watershed runoff. p 321-358. Publication 16, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;
#flow equation''':''' &amp;nbsp; Q = A.S, with units [L/T], where L is length (e.g. mm) and T is time (e.g. h, day)
#continuity or water balance equation''':''' &amp;nbsp; R = Q + dS/dT, with units [L/T]
where:&lt;br&gt;
Q is the ''runoff'' or'' discharge'' &lt;br&gt;
R is the ''effective rainfall'' or ''rainfall excess'' or ''recharge'' &lt;br&gt;
A is the constant ''reaction factor'' or ''response factor'' with unit [1/T] &lt;br&gt;
S is the water storage with unit [L] &lt;br&gt;
dS is a differential or small increment of S&lt;br&gt; 
dT is a differential or small increment of T

'''Runoff equation'''&lt;br&gt;
A combination of the two previous equations results in a [[differential equation]], whose solution is:
* Q2 = Q1 exp { &amp;minus;A (T2 &amp;minus; T1) } + R [ 1 &amp;minus; exp '''{''' &amp;minus;A (T2 &amp;minus; T1) '''}''' ]
This is the ''runoff equation'' or ''discharge equation'', where Q1 and Q2 are the values of Q at time T1 and T2 respectively while T2&amp;minus;T1 is a small time step during which the recharge can be assumed constant.

'''Computing the total hydrograph'''&lt;br&gt;
Provided the value of A is known, the ''total hydrograph'' can be obtained using a successive number of time steps and computing, with the ''runoff equation'', the runoff at the end of each time step from the runoff at the end of the previous time step.

'''Unit hydrograph'''&lt;br&gt;
The discharge may also be expressed as: Q = &amp;minus; dS/dT . Substituting herein the expression of Q in equation (1) gives the differential equation dS/dT = A.S, of which the solution is: S = exp(&amp;minus; A.t) . Replacing herein S by Q/A according to equation (1), it is obtained that: Q = A exp(&amp;minus; A.t) . This is called the [[hydrograph|instantaneous unit hydrograph]] (IUH) because the Q herein equals Q2 of the foregoing runoff equation using ''R'' = 0, and taking S as ''unity'' which makes Q1 equal to A according to equation (1).&lt;br&gt;
The availability of the foregoing ''runoff equation'' eliminates the necessity of calculating the ''total hydrograph'' by the summation of partial hydrographs using the ''IUH'' as is done with the more complicated [[convolution]] method.&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Kraijenhoff van de Leur, 1973. ''Rainfall-runoff relations and computational models''. In: Drainage Principle and Applications, Vol. II, Chapter 16, Theories of field drainage and watershed runoff. p 245-320. Publication 16, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Determining the response factor A'''&lt;br&gt;
When the ''response factor'' A can be determined from the characteristics of the watershed (catchment area), the reservoir can be used as a ''deterministic model'' or ''analytical model'', see [[hydrological modelling]].&lt;br&gt;
Otherwise, the factor A can be determined from a data record of rainfall and runoff using the method explained below under ''non-linear reservoir''. With this method  the reservoir can be used as a [[black box]] model.

'''Conversions'''&lt;br&gt;
1&amp;nbsp;mm/day corresponds to 10&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day per ha of the watershed&lt;br&gt;
1&amp;nbsp;l/s per ha corresponds to 8.64&amp;nbsp;mm/day or 86.4&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day per ha

==Non-linear reservoir==

Contrary to the linear reservoir, the non linear reservoir has a reaction factor A that is not a constant,&lt;ref&gt;''Land drainage and soil salinity: some Mexican experiences''. In: ILRI Annual Report 1995, p. 44-53. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement, Wageningen (ILRI), The Netherlands. On line: [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/mexican.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; but it is a function of S or Q (figure 2, 3).

Normally A increases with Q and S because the higher the water level is the higher the discharge capacity becomes. The factor is therefore called Aq instead of A.&lt;br&gt;
The non-linear reservoir has ''no'' usable [[unit hydrograph]].

During periods without rainfall or recharge, i.e. when ''R'' = 0, the runoff equation reduces to
* Q2 = Q1 exp { &amp;minus; Aq (T2 &amp;minus; T1) }, or:
or, using a ''unit time step'' (T2 &amp;minus; T1 = 1) and solving for Aq:
* Aq = &amp;minus; ln (Q2/Q1)
Hence, the reaction or response factor Aq can be determined from runoff or discharge measurements using ''unit time steps'' during dry spells, employing a [[numerical method]].

Figure 3 shows the relation between Aq (Alpha) and Q for a small valley (Rogbom) in Sierra Leone.&lt;br&gt;
Figure 4 shows observed and ''simulated'' or ''reconstructed'' discharge [[hydrograph]] of the watercourse at the downstream end of the same valley.&lt;ref&gt;A.Huizing, 1988. ''Rainfall-Runoff relations in a small cultivated valley in Sierra Leone''. Wetland Utilization Research Project. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement, Wageningen, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recharge==
[[File:Surface water cycle.svg|thumb|200px|left|Figure 7. Runoff from the water balance]]
The recharge, also called ''effective rainfall'' or ''rainfall excess'', can be modeled by a ''pre-reservoir'' (figure 6) giving the recharge as ''overflow''. The pre-reservoir knows the following elements:
*a maximum storage (Sm) with unit length [L]
*an actual storage (Sa) with unit [L]
*a relative storage: Sr = Sa/Sm
*a maximum escape rate (Em) with units length/time [L/T]. It corresponds to the maximum rate of [[evapotranspiration|evaporation]] plus ''percolation'' and [[groundwater recharge]], which will not take part in the runoff process (figure 5, 6)
*an actual escape rate: Ea = Sr.Em
*a  storage deficiency: Sd = Sm + Ea &amp;minus; Sa

The recharge during a unit time step (T2&amp;minus;T1=1) can be found from ''R'' = Rain &amp;minus; Sd&lt;br&gt;
The actual storage at the end of a ''unit time step'' is found as Sa2 = Sa1 + Rain &amp;minus; ''R'' &amp;minus; Ea, where Sa1 is the actual storage at the start of the time step.

The [[runoff curve number|Curve Number method]] (CN method) gives another way to calculate the recharge. The ''initial abstraction'' herein compares with Sm &amp;minus; Si, where Si is the initial value of Sa.

[[File:Playing janken - school in Japan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=|In [[Education in Japan|Japanese schools]] the ''senpai–kōhai'' relation is taught from an early age as an integral part of daily life.]]
{{see also|Japanese honorifics}}

'''''Senpai''''' ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:先輩|先輩]]}}, "earlier colleague") and '''''kōhai''''' ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:後輩|後輩]]}}, "later colleague") are terms from the [[Japanese language]] describing an informal hierarchical interpersonal relationship found in organizations, associations, clubs, businesses, and schools in [[Japan]].  The concept is based in [[Japanese philosophy]] and has permeated [[Culture of Japan|Japanese society]].

The relationship is an interdependent one, as a ''senpai'' requires a ''kōhai'' and vice versa, and establishes a bond determined by the date of entry to an organization.  The ''kōhai'' defers to the ''senpai''{{'}}s seniority and experience, and speaks to the ''senpai'' using [[Japanese honorifics|honorific language]].

==Concept==

The relationship is an interdependent one, as a ''senpai'' requires a ''kōhai'' and vice versa,{{sfn|Blomberg|1994|p=203}} and establishes a bond determined by the date of entry to an organization.{{sfn|Kodansha|1994|p=310}}  ''Senpai'' refers to the member of higher experience, hierarchy, level, or age in the organization who offers assistance, friendship, and counsel to a new or inexperienced member, known as the ''kōhai'', who must demonstrate gratitude, respect, and occasionally personal loyalty.{{sfn|Kodansha|1994|p=310}}{{sfn|Matsumoto|2005|pp=1480–1481}}  The ''Senpai'' acts at the same time as a friend.{{sfn|Kodansha|1994|p=310}}{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=187}}  This relation is similar to the interpersonal relation between tutor and tutored in Eastern culture, but differs in that the ''senpai'' and ''kōhai'' must work in the same organization.{{sfn|Kopp|2010}}

The relation originates in [[Confucianism|Confucian]] teaching, as well as the morals and ethics that have arrived in Japan from ancient China and have spread throughout various aspects of Japanese philosophy.  The ''senpai–kōhai'' relation is a vertical hierarchy (like a father–son relation) that emphasizes respect for authority, for the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]], and for one's elders, eliminating all forms of internal competition and reinforcing the unity of the organization.{{sfn|Matsumoto|2005|pp=1480–1481}}{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=187}}

Over time this mechanism has allowed the transfer of experience and knowledge, as well as the expansion of acquaintances, to maintaining the art of teaching alive.  It also allows the development of beneficial experiences between both, as the ''kōhai'' benefits from the ''senpai''{{'}}s knowledge and the ''senpai'' learns new experiences from the ''kōhai'' by way of developing a sense of responsibility.{{sfn|Panek|2006|p=135}}{{sfn|Hassell|1983|p=61}}{{sfn|Rubio|Brody|Castrogiovanni|2008|p=37}} This comradeship does not imply friendship; a ''senpai'' and ''kōhai'' may become friends, but such is not an expectation.{{sfn|Brinton|2001|p=159}}

The [[Korean language|Korean]] terms [[Korean_honorifics#Seonbae–hubae|''seonbae'' and ''hubae'']] are written with the same [[Kanji|Chinese characters]] and indicate a similar senior–junior relationship. The terms may have derived from Japanese, and may have had Chinese origins, though the ''senpai–kōhai'' relationship does not exist in Chinese culture.{{sfn|Sechiyama|2013|p=169}} However, it is close to the system of [[sifu]]–student system of Chinese martial arts.

==History==

[[File:Hamamatsu GirlsHighSchool 1911 SportsDay Naginata.jpg|thumb|alt=|Demonstrating the use of the ''[[naginata]]'' at a sports festival in [[Hamamatsu]] in 1911.  Discipline training in school clubs historically has influenced the ''senpai–kōhai'' system with students.]]

The ''senpai–kōhai'' system has existed since the beginning of [[History of Japan|Japanese history]].  Three elements have had a significant impact on its development: [[Confucianism]], the traditional Japanese family system, and the [[Civil Code of Japan|Civil Code of 1898]].{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=188}}

Confucianism arrived from China between the 6th and 9th centuries, but the derived line of thought that brought about deep social changes in Japan was [[Neo-Confucianism]], which became the official doctrine of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] (1603–1867).  The precepts of loyalty and [[filial piety]] as [[tribute]] ({{lang|ja|朝貢}} ''{{transl|ja|chōkō}}'') dominated the Japanese at the time, as respect for elders and ancestor worship that Chinese Confucianism taught were well accepted by the Japanese, and these influences have spread throughout daily life.  Like other Chinese influences, the Japanese adopted these ideas selectively and in their own manner, so that the "loyalty" in Confucianism was taken as loyalty to a [[Daimyō|feudal lord]] or the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]].{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|pp=188–189}}

The Japanese family system ({{lang|ja|家}} ''{{transl|ja|[[Ie (Japanese family system)|ie]]}}'') was also regulated by Confucian codes of conduct and had an influence on the establishment of the ''senpai–kōhai'' relation.  In this family system the father, as male head, had absolute power over the family and the eldest son inherited the family property.  The father had power because he was the one to receive an education and was seen to have superior ethical knowledge.  Since reverence for superiors was considered a virtue in Japanese society, the wife and children had to obey it. In addition to the hereditary system, only the eldest son could receive his father's possessions, and neither the eldest daughter nor the younger children received anything from him.{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=189}}

The last factor influencing the ''senpai–kōhai'' system was the Civil Code of 1898, which strengthened the rules of privilege of [[seniority]] and reinforced the traditional family system, giving clear definitions of hierarchical values within the family.  This was called ''koshusei'' ({{lang|ja|戸主制}}, "family-head system"), in which the head of the household had the right to command his family and the eldest son inherited that position.  These statutes were abolished in [[1947]], after the [[surrender of Japan]] at the end of [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]].  These ideals nevertheless remained during the following years as a psychological influence in Japanese society.{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=189}}

==Terminology==

The seniority rules are reflected in various grammatical rules in the [[Japanese language]].  A person who speaks respectfully to a superior uses [[Honorific speech in Japanese|honorific language]] ({{lang|ja|敬語}} ''{{transl|ja|keigo}}''), which is divided into three categories:{{sfn|Matsuura|Porta Fuentes|2002|p=261}}{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=189}}

* ''{{transl|ja|Sonkeigo}}'' ({{lang|ja|尊敬語}}, "respectful language"): used to denote respect towards a superior with or of whom one speaks, including the actions, objects, characteristics, and persons related to this person.{{sfn|Matsuura|Porta Fuentes|2002|p=261}}
* ''{{transl|ja|Kenjōgo}}'' ({{lang|ja|謙譲語}}, "humble language"): in contrast to ''sonkeigo'', with ''kenjōgo'' the speaker shows respect to a superior by lowering or deprecating him or herself.{{sfn|Matsuura|Porta Fuentes|2002|p=262}}
* ''{{transl|ja|Teineigo}}'' ({{lang|ja|丁寧語}}, "polite language"): differs from the other two in that the speaker shows only to the speaker rather than those being spoken about.&lt;!-- this could be improved --&gt;  Use of the verb ''desu'' ("to be") and the verb ending ''-masu'' are examples of ''teineigo''.{{sfn|Matsuura|Porta Fuentes|2002|p=261}}

''Sonkeigo'' and ''kenjōgo'' have expressions (verbs, nouns, and special prefixes) particular to the type of language; for example, the ordinary Japanese verb for "to do" is ''suru'', but in ''sonkeigo'' is ''nasaru'' and in ''kenjōgo'' is ''itasu''.{{sfn|Matsuura|Porta Fuentes|2002|pp=263–265}}

Another rule in the hierarchical relation is the use of honorific suffixes of address.  A ''senpai'' addresses a ''kōhai'' with the suffix ''-kun'' after the ''kōhai''{{'}}s given name or surname, regardless if the ''kōhai'' is male or female.  A ''kōhai'' similarly addresses a ''senpai'' with the suffix ''-senpai'' or ''-san''; it is extremely unusual for a ''kōhai'' to refer to a ''senpai'' with the suffix ''-sama'', which indicates the highest level of respect to the person spoken to.{{sfn|Matsuura|Porta Fuentes|2002|pp=115–116}}&lt;!--  Although the ''senpai–kōhai'' relation is marked with respect language, the suffixes ''-kun'', ''-senpai'' or ''-san'' are used to indicate there is also a relation of comradery and confidence between the two.  ''Senpai'' can also be used as a pronoun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/lexicon.php?id=20 ''Sempai'']. ''[[Anime News Network]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==Prevalence==

[[File:1gB.jpg|thumb|At the international level the ''senpai–kōhai'' relation has spread through [[martial arts]], in which the members of different ''[[kyū]]'' and ''[[Dan (rank)|dan]]'' levels are sorted by belt colour.]]

One place the ''senpai–kōhai'' relation applies to its greatest extent in Japan is in schools.  For example, in junior and senior high schools (especially in school clubs) third-year students (who are the oldest) demonstrate great power as ''senpais''.  It is common in school sports clubs for new ''kōhais'' to have to perform basic tasks such as retrieving balls, cleaning playing fields, taking care of equipment, and even wash elder students' clothes.  They must also bow to or salute their ''senpais'' when congratulated,{{sfn|Sugimoto|2003|p=132}}{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=191}} and ''senpais'' may punish ''kōhais'' or treat them severely.{{sfn|Blomberg|1994|p=203}}{{sfn|Sugimoto|2003|p=132}}

The main reason for these humble actions is that it is believed that team members can become good players only if they are submissive, obedient, and follow the orders of the trainer or captain, and thus become a humble, responsible, and cooperative citizen in the future.  Relations in Japanese schools also place a stronger emphasis on the age than on the abilities of students.  The rules of superiority between a ''senpai'' and a ''kōhai'' are analogous to the teacher–student relation, in which the age and experience of the teacher must be respected and never questioned.{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=191}}

The ''senpai–kōhai'' relation is weaker in universities, as students of a variety of ages attend the same classes; students show respect to older members primarily through polite language (''teineigo'').  Vertical seniority rules nevertheless prevail between teachers based on academic rank and experience.{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=191}}

The ''senpai–kōhai'' system also prevails in Japanese businesses.  The social environment in Japanese businesses is regulated by two standards: the system of superiority and the system of [[permanent employment]].  The status, salary, and position of employees depend heavily of seniority, and veteran employees generally take the highest positions and receive higher salaries than their subordinates.  Until the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, employment was guaranteed for life and thus such employees did not have to worry about losing their positions.{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=191}}

The ''senpai–kōhai'' relation is a cornerstone in interpersonal relations within the Japanese business world; for example, at meetings the lower-level employee should sit in the seat closest to the door, called ''shimoza'' ({{lang|ja|下座}}, "lower seat"), while the senior employee (sometimes the boss) sits next to some important guest in a position called ''kamiza'' ({{lang|ja|上座}}, "upper seat").  During meetings, most employees do not give their opinions, but simply listen and concur with their superiors, although they can express opinions with the prior consent of the employees of greater rank and influence in the company.{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=192}}

Outside Japan, the ''senpai–kōhai'' relation is often found in the teaching of [[Japanese martial arts]], though misunderstandings arise due to lack of historical knowledge, and as the vertical social hierarchy of Japan does not exist in Western cultures.{{sfn|Lowry|2002|pp=28, 122}}

==Issues==

Despite the ''senpai–kōhai'' relation's deep roots in Japanese society, there have been changes since the end of the 20th century in academic and business organizations.  ''Kōhais'' no longer show as much respect to the experience of their ''senpais'', the relation has become more superficial, and the age factor has begun to lose importance.  The student body has diversified with Japanese students who have spent a large part of their lives overseas and have returned to Japan, as well as foreign students without a mentality rooted in the Japanese hierarchical system.{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=187}}

The collapse of [[Japanese asset price bubble|the economic bubble]] in the early 1990s caused a high level of unemployment, including the laying off of high-ranked employees.  Companies since then first began to consider employees' skills rather than age or length of service with the company, due to which many long-serving employees lost their positions over being incapable of fulfilling expectations.  Gradually many companies have had to restructure their salary and promotion systems, and seniority has thus lost some influence in Japanese society.{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=187}}

Attitudes towards the ''senpai–kōhai'' system vary from appreciation for traditions and the benefits of a good ''senpai–kōhai'' relationship; to reluctant acquiescence; to antipathy.  Those who criticize the system find it arbitrary and unfair, that ''senpais'' were often pushy, and that the system results in students who are shy or afraid of standing out from the group. For example, some ''kōhais'' fear that if they outperform their ''senpais'' in an activity, their ''senpai'' will [[Face (sociological concept)|lose face]], for which ''kōhais'' must apologize.  In some cases, the relation is open to violence and bullying.  Most Japanese people—even those who criticize it—accept the ''senpai–kōhai'' system as [[Common sense|common-sense]] aspect of society, straying from which will have inevitably negative social consequences.{{sfn|McVeigh|2015|pp=220–224}}

The illusion, created in 2003 by web designer Nobuyuki Kayahara,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.procreo.jp/labo.html Nobuyuki Kayahara's website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web | last = Parker-Pope | first = Tara | title = The Truth About the Spinning Dancer | work = Well Blog | publisher = The New York Times | date = 2008-04-28 | url = http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/the-truth-about-the-spinning-dancer/ | accessdate = 2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; involves the apparent direction of motion of the figure. Some observers initially see the figure as spinning [[clockwise]] (viewed from above) and some counterclockwise. Additionally, some may see the figure suddenly spin in the opposite direction.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

The illusion derives from the lack of visual cues for depth. For instance, as the dancer's arms move from viewer's left to right, it is possible to view her arms passing between her body and the viewer (that is, in the foreground of the picture, in which case she would be circling counterclockwise on her right foot) and it is also possible to view her arms as passing behind the dancer's body (that is, in the background of the picture, in which case she is seen circling clockwise on her left foot).

When she is facing to the left or to the right, her breasts and ponytail clearly define the direction she is facing, although there is ambiguity in which leg is which.  However, as she moves away from facing to the left (or from facing to the right), the dancer can be seen (by different viewers, not by a single individual) facing in either of two directions.  At first, these two directions are fairly close to each other (both left, say, but one facing slightly forward, the other facing slightly backward) but they become further and further away from each other until we reach a position where her ponytail and breasts are in line with the viewer (so that neither her breasts nor her ponytail are seen so readily). In this position, she could be facing either away from the viewer or towards the viewer, so that the two positions the two different viewers could see are 180 degrees apart.

== Psychology of visual perception ==

It has been established that the silhouette is more often seen rotating clockwise than counterclockwise. According to an online survey of over 1600 participants, approximately two thirds of observers initially perceived the silhouette to be rotating clockwise. In addition, observers who initially perceived a clockwise rotation had more difficulty experiencing the alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Casual Fridays: TK-421, why can't you spin that woman in reverse? | work = Cognitive Daily | date = 2008-10-10 | url = http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2008/10/casual_fridays_tk421_why_cant.php | accessdate = 2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PET-MIPS-anim.gif|thumb|upright|right|150px|This [[positron emission tomography]] [[Full-body CT scan|scan]] of a woman has a similar effect when viewed spinning]]

These results can be explained by a psychological study providing evidence for a viewing-from-above bias that influences observers' perceptions of the silhouette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Troje N F | first = McAdam M | title = The viewing-from-above bias and the silhouette illusion | work = i-Perception 1(3) 143-148 | date = 2010-11-14 | url = http://i-perception.perceptionweb.com/fulltext/i01/i0408.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110430013619/http://i-perception.perceptionweb.com/fulltext/i01/i0408.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2011-04-30 | accessdate = 2010-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kattinakere | first = Ragu | title = Spinning lady explained | date = 2008-02-03 | url = http://thoughtslot.blogspot.com/2008/02/spinning-nude-lady.html | accessdate = 2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kayahara's dancer is presented with a camera elevation slightly above the horizontal plane. Consequently, the dancer may also be seen from above or below in addition to spinning clockwise or counterclockwise, and facing toward or away from the observer. Upon inspection, one may notice that in Kayahara's original illusion, seeing the dancer spin clockwise is paired with constantly holding an elevated viewpoint and seeing the dancer from above. The opposite is also true; an observer maintaining an anti-clockwise percept has assumed a viewpoint below the dancer. If observers report perceiving Kayahara's original silhouette as spinning clockwise more often than counterclockwise, there are two chief possibilities. They may have a bias to see it spinning clockwise, or they may have a bias to assume a viewpoint from above. To tease these two apart, the researchers created their own versions of Kayahara's silhouette illusion by recreating the dancer and varying the camera elevations. This allowed for clockwise/from-above (like Kayahara's original) and clockwise/from-below pairings. The results indicated that there was no clockwise bias, but rather viewing-from-above bias. Furthermore, this bias was dependent upon camera elevation. In other words, the greater the camera elevation, the more often an observer saw the dancer from above.

In [[popular psychology]], the illusion has been incorrectly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Novella | first = Steven | authorlink = Steven Novella | title = Left Brain - Right brain and the Spinning Girl | work = NeuroLogica Blog | date = 2007-10-11 | url = http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php?p=27 | accessdate = 2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified as a [[personality test]] that supposedly reveals which [[cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere of the brain]] [[Lateralization of brain function|is dominant]] in the observer. Under this wrong interpretation, it has been popularly called the Right Brain–Left Brain test,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Right Brain vs Left Brain test | work = PerthNow | publisher = The Sunday Times | date = 2007-09-26 | url = http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,22492511-5005375,00.html | accessdate = 2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was widely circulated on the Internet during late 2008 to early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Which side of your brain is more dominant? | url = http://en.sommer-sommer.com/braintest/ | accessdate = 2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 paper describes the brain activation related to the switching of perception. Utilizing fMRI in a volunteer capable to switch at will the direction of rotation, it was found that a part of the right parietal lobe is responsible for the switching. The authors relate this brain activation to the recently described spontaneous brain fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;Bernal B, Guillen M, Marquez J. The spinning dancer illusion and spontaneous brain fluctuations: an fMRI study. Neurocase. 2014;20:627-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bistable perception ==

There are other optical illusions that depend on the same or a similar kind of visual ambiguity known as [[multistable perception|multistable, in that case bistable, perception]]. One example is the [[Necker Cube]].

Depending on the perception of the observer, the apparent direction of spin may change any number of times, a typical feature of so-called [[bistable percept]]s such as the [[Necker cube]] which may be perceived from time to time as seen from above or below. These alternations are spontaneous and may randomly occur without any change in the stimulus or [[intention]] by the observer. However some observers may have difficulty perceiving a change in motion at all.

One way of changing the direction perceived is to use averted vision and mentally look for an arm going behind instead of in front, then carefully move the eyes back. Some may perceive a change in direction more easily by narrowing visual focus to a specific region of the image, such as the spinning foot or the shadow below the dancer and gradually looking upwards. One can also try to tilt one's head to perceive a change in direction. Another way is to watch the base shadow foot, and perceive it as the toes always pointing away from you and it can help with direction change. You can also close your eyes and try and envision the dancer going in a direction then reopen them and the dancer should change directions. Still another way is to wait for the dancer's legs to cross in the projection and then try to perceive a change in the direction in what follows. You could also try using your peripheral vision to distract the dominant part of the brain, slowly look away from the ballerina and you may begin to see it spin in the other direction. Perhaps the easiest method is to blink rapidly (slightly varying the rate if necessary) until consecutive images are going in the 'new' direction.  Then open your eyes and the new rotational direction is maintained. It is even possible to see the illusion in a way that the dancer is not spinning at all, but simply rotating back and forth 180 degrees.

Slightly altered versions of the animation have been created with an additional visual cue to assist viewers who have difficulty 'seeing' one rotation direction or the other.  Labels and white edges have been added to the legs, to make it clear which leg is passing in front of the other. ''(see below)'' Looking at one of these can sometimes then make the original dancer image above spin in the corresponding direction.

To create this image, the original was split into its 34 constituent frames, and a horizontal [[panorama]] was created from those frames.}} &lt;!-- As of 2008/08/09, use of a collapsed navbox was attempted to wrap the wide image. Unfortunately, with this set up, the image displays correctly with MF2, but not with MF3 or IE7. With MF3 or IE7, the width of the image is not restricted to the page width as it should be, but instead it is the entire width of the image, and this is a problem. Due to this problem, the navbox was removed. Other collapsible navboxes and a collapsible table were attempted as well, but they all resulted in the same problem. It is hoped that this image doesn't have the same spoiler effect as the images with the visual cue do. --&gt;

[[File:Three-act structure.svg|thumb|500px|A visual representation of the three-act structure]]

The '''three-act structure''' is a model used in [[narrative]] fiction that divides a story into three parts ([[act (drama)|acts]]), often called the Setup, the Confrontation and the Resolution.

== Structure ==
'''The first act''' is usually used for [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], to establish the main characters, their relationships and the world they live in. Later in the first act, a dynamic, on-screen incident occurs, known as the ''[[inciting incident]]'', or ''catalyst'', that confronts the main character (the [[protagonist]]), and whose attempts to deal with this incident lead to a second and more dramatic situation, known as the first plot point, which (a) signals the end of the first act, (b) ensures life will never be the same again for the protagonist and (c) raises a dramatic question that will be answered in the climax of the film. The dramatic question should be framed in terms of the protagonist's call to action, (Will X recover the diamond? Will Y get the girl? Will Z capture the killer?).&lt;ref name="trottier"&gt;Trottier, David: "The Screenwriter's Bible", pp. 5–7. Silman James, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The second act''', also referred to as "rising action", typically depicts the protagonist's attempt to resolve the problem initiated by the first turning point, only to find themselves in ever worsening situations. Part of the reason protagonists seem unable to resolve their problems is because they do not yet have the skills to deal with the forces of [[Antagonist|antagonism]] that confront them. They must not only learn new skills but arrive at a higher sense of awareness of who they are and what they are capable of, in order to deal with their predicament, which in turn changes who they are. This is referred to as ''character development'' or a ''[[character arc]]''. This cannot be achieved alone and they are usually aided and abetted by mentors and co-protagonists.&lt;ref name="trottier"/&gt;

'''The third act''' features the resolution of the story and its subplots. The [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] is the [[Scene (drama)|scene]] or sequence in which the main tensions of the story are brought to their most intense point and the dramatic question answered, leaving the protagonist and other characters with a new sense of who they really are.&lt;ref name="trottier"/&gt;

'''Xulvi-Brunet and Sokolov’s algorithm''' generates [[Network science|networks]] with chosen degree correlations. This method is based on link rewiring, in which the desired degree is governed by parameter ρ. By varying this single parameter it is possible to generate networks from random (when ρ = 0) to perfectly [[Assortativity|assortative]] or disassortative (when ρ = 1).  This algorithm allows to keep network’s [[degree distribution]] unchanged when changing the value of ρ.&lt;ref name="xavi"&gt;Xulvi-Brunet and Sokolov (2005). "Changing correlations in networks: assortativity and dissortativity". Acta Phys. Pol. B 36: 1431-1455. 
http://www.actaphys.uj.edu.pl/fulltext?series=Reg&amp;vol=36&amp;page=1431&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assortative model==
In assortative networks, well-connected nodes are likely to be connected to other highly connected nodes. Social networks are examples of assortative networks. This means that an assortative network has the property that almost all nodes with the same degree are linked only between themselves.&lt;ref name="LSDS"&gt;Pop.(2011). "Resource Management based on Gossip Monitoring Algorithm for LSDS". Scalable Computing: Practice and Experience Volume 12, Number 1, pp. 21–34.  http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=7A0C831420583D5E245EC75FFC6E8426?doi=10.1.1.370.875&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Xulvi-Brunet - Sokolov algorithm for this type of networks is the following. 
In a given network, two links connecting four different nodes are chosen randomly. These nodes are ordered by their degrees. Then, with probability ρ, the links are randomly rewired in such a way that one link connects the two nodes with the smaller degrees and the other connects the two nodes with the larger degrees. If one or both of these links already existed in the network, the step is discarded and is repeated again. Thus, there will be no self-connected nodes or multiple links connecting the same two nodes. Different degrees of assortativity of a network can be achieved by changing the parameter ρ. 
Assortative networks are characterized by highly connected groups of nodes with similar degree. As assortativity grows,the average path length and [[clustering coefficient]] increase.&lt;ref name="xavi"/&gt;

==Disassortative model==
In disassortative networks, highly connected nodes tend to connect to less-well-connected nodes with larger probability than in uncorrelated networks.  Examples of such networks include biological networks.&lt;ref name="LSDS"/&gt;
 
The Xulvi-Brunet and Sokolov’s algorithm for this type of networks is similar to the one for assortative networks with one minor change. As before, two links of four nodes are randomly chose and the nodes are ordered with respect to their degrees. However, in this case, the links are rewired (with probability p) such that one link connects the highest connected node with the node with the lowest degree and the other link connects the two remaining nodes randomly with probability 1 – ρ. Similarly, if the new links already existed, the previous step is repeated. This algorithm does not change the degree of nodes and thus the degree distribution of the network.&lt;ref name="xavi"/&gt;
