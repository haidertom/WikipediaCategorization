The '''adsorption/bio-oxidation process''' is a two-stage modification of the [[activated sludge]] process used for [[wastewater treatment]]. It consists of a high-loaded A-stage and low-loaded B-stage. The process is operated without a primary [[clarifier]], with the A-stage being an open dynamic biological system. Both stages have separate settling tanks and sludge recycling lines, thus maintaining unique microbial communities in both reactors.

==History==
[[Adsorption]]/bio-oxidation process was invented in the mid-1970s by the professor of the [[RWTH Aachen University]] Botho Böhnke. It was based on the finding, made by the German engineer [[Karl Imhoff]] in the 50th.{{Explain|date=March 2017}} Imhoff stated that the treatment efficiency of 60-80 percent could be achieved in highly loaded activated sludge basins.

In 1977 Böhnke published his first article on adsorption/bio-oxidation process.&lt;ref&gt;Böhnke B. (1977). Das Adsorptions-Belebungsverfahren. Korrespondenz Abwasser, 24. Jahrg., 2/77&lt;/ref&gt; The same year the patent was issued. Extensive research of the following years, conducted by prof. Böhnke together with Bernd and Andreas Diering, ended up in 1985 with the establishment of the company Dr.-Ing. Bernd Diering GmbH. The same year AB-process was for the first time applied in a full-scale at the [[Krefeld]], Germany [[sewage treatment]] plant (800 000 P.E.). In 1990, 19 full scale installations existed in Western Germany alone. Further application of the process in Europe was hindered by the tightening of the effluent discharge requirements with respect to nitrogen and phosphorus. The process came into notice in 2000th again due to the increased interest in [[energy recovery]] from [[wastewater]].

==Principle of operation==
The A-stage, or [[adsorption]] stage is the most innovative component of the process. It is not preceded by [[primary treatment]]. [[File:AB process scheme.png|thumb|Simple schematic description of the adsorption/bio-oxidation process]] Influent organic matter is removed in the A-stage mainly by [[flocculation]] and [[sorption]] to sludge due to the high loading rates (2-10 g BOD • g [[Volatile suspended solids|VSS]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; • d&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and low sludge age (typically 4-10 h). [[Hydrolysis]] of complex organic molecules occurs improving biodegradability of the influent of the B-stage. High loading rates and low sludge age favours development of dynamic [[biocoenosis]] with a large fraction of microorganisms present in the exponential growth phase. Diverse sludge biocoenosis increase variety of organic compounds that can be degraded in the A-stage and makes the process more stable towards the shock loads.&lt;ref name=boehnke2/&gt; Altogether, up to 80% of the influent organic matter can be removed in the A-stage.&lt;ref name=boehnke2/&gt; The required reactor volume and oxygen supply are lower if compared to the removal in the conventional [[activated sludge]] process.

The B-stage, or bio-oxidation stage, is a typical low-loaded activated sludge process, where [[biodegradation]] of the remaining organic material occurs. The B-stage can be designed for nitrogen and/or phosphorus removal by alternating aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic zones in the reactor.

===Typical operational conditions of the adsorption/bio-oxidation process===

===Advantages of the process===
* Lower aeration requirements decrease energy consumption and aeration costs for 20 percent if compared with conventional single stage activated sludge plant.&lt;ref name=eolss&gt;[http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c09/E4-11-06-03.pdf Technologies that Transform. Pollutants into Innocuous Components]. www.eolss.net&lt;/ref&gt;
* The volumes of [[Activated sludge#Process description|aeration tanks]] are 40% lower if compared with conventional single stage activated sludge plant.&lt;ref name=eolss/&gt;
* Increased sludge production in the A-stage results in increased [[biogas]] production in the [[Anaerobic digestion|digester]] (for plants with [[anaerobic digestion]] of excess sludge).&lt;ref name=stowa2010-44&gt;[http://waterenenergie.stowa.nl/upload/publicaties/STOWA%202010-44%20European%20report%20100208%20-%20update.pdf Energy efficiency in the European water industry]. Stowa report #2010-44&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stability towards the shock loads (pH, [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD), toxic substances) explained by the wide-ranging biochemical potential, high mutation capacity and adaptability of sludge in the A-stage.&lt;ref name=boehnke2&gt;Boehnke, B., Diering, B., &amp; Zuckut, S. W. (1997). AB process removes organics and nutrients. Water Environment and Technology, 9(3), 23-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A-stage can receive higher organic loads than conventional activated sludge systems.
* Effluent concentrations are more stable because of the two-stage process configuration employed.
* Heavy metals are mainly removed with the A-stage sludge. Therefore, B-stage sludge has lower concentrations of heavy metals than sludge from conventional activated sludge process and may comply with the agricultural standards.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, J.-L., Zhang, J.-T., Chen, X.,`Yi, H.-X. (2011). Characteristics of heavy-metal translating in adsorption and biodegradation activated sludge process. International Conference on Electric Technology and Civil Engineering, ICETCE 2011 - Proceedings.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drawbacks of the process===
* Incomplete denitrification is often observed in the B-stage if the influent C/N ratio is low. Direct by-pass of a part of A-stage influent with high organic matter content to the B-stage is used to increase the C/N ratio.
* High sludge production in the A-stage is a drawback for WWTPs that are not equipped with anaerobic digestion of sludge, because it increases sludge treatment costs.
* Sludge from A-stage has poor settling properties.&lt;ref name=stowa2010-44/&gt;

==Nutrient removal==
Nitrogen removal in the A-stage can reach 30-40%, as nitrogen of organic compounds is incorporated in [[upflow anaerobic sludge blanket]] (UASB) reactor sludge.

The sludge age of the B-stage is typically between 8 and 20 days promoting the growth of [[Nitrification|nitrifiers]]. Therefore, complete nitrification is usually achieved in the B-stage.&lt;ref name=boehnke2/&gt; Complete denitrification is difficult to achieve, because of the low C:N ratio in the influent of the B-stage. Insufficient carbon supply of carbon source to the B-stage occurs due to the high efficiency of organic matter removal in the A-stage. The problem can be solved by decreasing organic matter removal in the A-stage, external carbon source supply, intermittent aeration or decreased HRT of the A-stage and/or on-line control of certain operational parameters.&lt;ref name=wenyi&gt;Wenyi, D., Hong, D., Li-an, Z., Jia, M., Baozhen, W. (2006). Operational retrofits of AB process for biological removal of nitrogen and phosphorus. Water Practice &amp; Technology, 1 (4) doi: 10.2166/WPT.2006078&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal anaerobic and anoxic compartments are introduced before the aerated zone of the B-stage.

Phosphorus removal from the secondary effluent of the B-stage can be achieved by coagulation with ferric and aluminium salts, e.g. FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Xie, J.-L., Shen, X., Peng, Z., Wang, Q. (2011). Study on the phosphorus removal from the secondary effluent of AB process by ferric chloride. 5th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering, ICBBE 2011 - Proceedings&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hu, Y.-Y., Luo, X.-X., Cheng, J.-H., Luo, G. (2008). Experimental investigation of chemically-enhanced phosphorus removal with adsorption-biodegradation process. Journal of South China University of Technology (Natural Science)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications for municipal wastewater treatment==
The adsorption/bio-oxidation process was applied at the Krefeld plant (800 000 P.E.) in 1985 for the first time. The plant was expanded and modified and currently treats municipal and industrial wastewater of 1 200 000 P.E.&lt;ref name=boehnke2/&gt;

Currently adsorption/bio-oxidation process is applied at the municipal treatment plants in [[Germany]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] (WWTP Dokhaven (Rotterdam), WWTP Utrecht, WWTP Garmerwolde (Groningen) etc.), [[Austria]] (WWTP Salzburg, WWTP Strass etc.), [[Spain]], [[United States|USA]], [[China]] etc.&lt;ref name=stowa2&gt;[http://www.stowa.nl/Upload/Presentatie%20Marthe%20de%20Graaff%20%28Inventarisatie%20van%20AB-systemen%20in%20NL%29%20%282%29.pdf Inventarisatie van AB-systemen in NL]. www.stowa.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

Adsorption/bio-oxidation process is a part of innovative wastewater treatment concept WaterSchoon, realized in the Netherlands. 250 apartments in the new district Noorderhoek ([[Sneek]], the Netherlands) are equipped with separate collection systems for toilet wastewater and the rest of the household wastewater (or so-called [[greywater]]). Both streams are treated separately in order to maximize recovery of resources from wastewater. Adsorption/bio-oxidation process is used for grey water treatment to increase sludge production. Sludge, produced in both stages of the process, is digested together with toilet wastewater in the UASB reactor to maximize energy recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterschoon.nl/index.htm]. www.waterschoon.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications for industrial wastewater treatment==
The adsorption/bio-oxidation process is used for treatment of [[industrial wastewater]] with high COD, including wastewater from:
* [[Environmental impact of paper#Water pollution|Pulp and paper industry]]&lt;ref name=knudsen&gt;Knudsen, L., Pedersen, J. A., &amp; Munck, J. (1994). Advanced treatment of paper mill effluents by a two-stage activated sludge process. Water Science and Technology, 30 (3), 173-181&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Textile industry]]&lt;ref name=schulze-rettmer&gt;Schulze-Rettmer, R., Kim, S. S., &amp; Son, S. S. (1992). Experience with two-stage activated sludge plants for industrial wastewaters in Korea. Water Science and Technology, 25 (4-5), 427-428.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Industrial wastewater treatment#Food industry|Food industry]], including dairy industry &lt;ref name=100years&gt;Jenkins, D. &amp; Wanner, J, (Eds.) (2014). Activated Sludge - 100 Years and Counting. IWA publishing {{ISBN|9781780404943}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pharmaceutical industry]]&lt;ref name=100years/&gt;
* [[Tanning (leather)#Health and environmental impact|Leather tanning industry]]&lt;ref name=schulze-rettmer/&gt;

The C/N and C/P ratios of industrial wastewater is often too high for complete aerobic [[biodegradation]] of the influent organic matter, even after the adsorption stage. Addition of nutrients prior to bio-oxidation stage is required in these cases.&lt;ref name=knudsen/&gt;

The '''Al-Yahudu tablets''' are a collection of about 200 clay tablets from the sixth and fifth centuries BCE on the exiled [[Judaism|Judean]] community in [[Babylonia]] following the destruction of the [[First Temple]].&lt;ref name="NH"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hasson|first1=Nir|title=Ancient Tablets Disclose Jewish Exiles’ Life in Babylonia|url=https://archive.is/4ptde|website=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ben-Zion|first1=Ilan|title=‘By the rivers of Babylon’ exhibit breathes life into Judean exile|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/by-the-rivers-of-babylon-exhibit-breathes-life-into-judean-exile/|website=Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Luke|title=Ancient tablets reveal life of Jews in Nebuchadnezzar's Babylon|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-archaeology-babylon/ancient-tablets-reveal-life-of-jews-in-nebuchadnezzars-babylon-idUSKBN0L71EK20150203|website=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contain information on the physical condition of the exiles from Israel and their financial condition in [[Babylon]].&lt;ref name="PLC"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pearce|first1=Laurie|last2=Wunsch|first2=Cornelia|title=Documents of Judean Exiles and West Semites in Babylonia in the Collection of David Sofer|date=2014|publisher=Cornell University Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ULl9oAEACAAJ|isbn=9781934309575}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tablets are named after the central settlement mentioned in the documents, '''al-Yahudu''' ([[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: The city of Judah).

The earliest document in the collection dates back to 572 BCE, about 15 years after the destruction of the Temple, during the reign of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vukosavović|first1=Filip|title=By the Rivers of Babylon: The Story of the Babylonian Exile|date=2015|publisher=Bible Lands Museum|isbn=978-9657027271|ref=FV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent tablet dates back to 477 BCE, during the reign of [[Xerxes I]], about 60 years after the [[Return to Zion]] began and about 20 years before the rise of [[Ezra the Scribe]].

==Discovery and research==
The public records do not contain information on the location and date of the discovery of the documents in [[Iraq]], and it seems that they were not found in an archaeological excavation. The first time the public was exposed to the documents and the settlement of al-Yahudu was in an article by two French researchers in 1999, which dealt with three legal documents of Jews in Babylon, including the city of al-Yahudu itself. These three certificates were part of a small collection of six documents in the possession of [[Israelis|Israeli]] antiquities collector [[Shlomo Moussaieff (businessman)|Shlomo Moussaieff]].

At the beginning of the 21st century, it turned out that this was not a small collection, but a collection of more than 200 documents, most of which were in two other private collections. Some of the documents were presented in 2004 at [[Beth Hatefutsoth]] in [[Tel Aviv]] and were investigated in part by Kathleen Abraham of [[Bar-Ilan University]]. Since then, the entire collection has been investigated mainly by two researchers - Cornelia Wunsch of Germany and Laurie Pearce of the United States. After a series of papers on documentary issues, Wensh and Pierce published in early 2015 the first full translations and analysis of the collection in the author's book.&lt;ref name="PLC" /&gt;

==Geography==
Although no information was given on the circumstances of the discovery of the documents, the plan provides clues as to the location of the communities mentioned in the Jewish exiles. The assessment is based on two main components:

* The mention of familiar sites, such as cities that have been excavated and researched, or concepts that have been evaluated for their location.
* Cross-referencing the names of the few writers mentioned in the documents vis-à-vis the communities mentioned in them and the date of writing the documents. In some cases, this cross-cross has made it possible to estimate the distance between a recognized locality and an unrecognized locality.

Based off this, researchers estimate that al-Yahudu and the other communities mentioned in the documents are located in the area southeast of the city of [[Nippur]].&lt;ref name="PLC" /&gt;

===The localities mentioned in the documents===
Beyond the settlement of al-Yahudu, other settlements were mentioned where Jews were living or working. Some of them are well-known cities and some were apparently satellite settlements of al-Yahudu. The main localities mentioned in the documents are:

* '''Al-Yahudu''': The dominant settlement in the documents. The most ancient document in the collection, dated 572 BCE, is called Al-Yahudiyya ("City of the Jews").
* '''Beit Nashar''': Apparently not far from al-Yahudu. A mixed community, where Jews also lived. The ruler of the settlement, which appears in many of the documents, was Ahikar ben Riemot, who was probably Jewish in origin.
* '''House of Aviram''': Possibly named after [[Abraham]]. Although this locality is located in connection with al-Yahudu, there were no Jews with Jewish names and it is unclear whether Jews lived there. The most famous figure in this locality is Zbava Sher-Ozer, an heir to the Babylonian throne.
* The village of '''Ubu Sha Tubiyama''': Possibly named after the village's founder, Tuviyahu ben Mukhaiahu.
* '''Al-Hazatu''': A community of [[Gaza City|Gazan]] exiles.

The collection also contains documents from the cities of [[Babylon]], [[Nippur]], [[Borsippa]], and even a document signed on the banks of the [[Kebar River]], known in the bible as the site of the Exile and known from the Babylonian records as an irrigation canal which was also used as a transportation channel for commerce and movement of people. The collection contained no references to other biblical-known cities in which the Babylonian exiles resided.&lt;ref name="PLC" /&gt;

==Life of Jews in Babylon as reflected in the documents==
The al-Yahudu tablets cover a period of 100 years under Babylonian rule, especially Persian. In general, the documents show a similarity between the life of the Jews and other exiles in the kingdom at the time. In principle, it can be said that the documents attest to the tension between the preservation of Jewish identity, language, culture and religion and the need, and sometimes the will, to integrate into life in Babylon. In this respect, life in Babylon corresponds to the instruction of the prophet Jeremiah in a letter he sent from Judah to the Babylonian exiles following the exile of [[Jeconiah]] in 577 BCE.

===Status of Exiles===
According to the documents, the Jews were defined as "Shushanu." This status is also known from other documents from the period and relates to foreign exiles who were exiled to Babylon, mainly in order to rehabilitate cities and areas devastated by past wars. These exiles received land lease for their livelihood in the form of service in exchange for land. Although they can be compared to the status of land-bound tenants, they seem to have enjoyed freedom of movement, they were defined as independent entities before the Babylonian and Persian law and enjoyed the possibilities of social and economic integration.

===Service for the Kingdom===
The type of service required of the exiles is mentioned in the documents, both in the context of the designation of the leasehold lands and directly in the jobs that the exiles were required to perform as part of the payment of taxes. Based on other documents dealing with payment of tax and service to the kingdom after their settlement, it seems that other exiles were employed in physical labor. These included construction work, excavation and maintenance of irrigation channels. It is possible that among these were many of the "plow and locksmith," mentioned in connection with the exile of [[Jeconiah]] in 597 BCE. The nature of the service described also appears to indicate a restriction imposed on them in their movement, and to a certain extent may have been in this period a status similar to that of a slave. This period maybe reflected in the famous lines from [[Psalms]] 137 on the exile.

Most of the Jews on the certificates made their living from agriculture. Most of the land they leased grew [[Date palm|dates]] and [[barley]], but [[wheat]], [[spices]] and [[linen]] were also mentioned in the documents. Analysis of the money amounts in the transactions appearing in the certificates shows that they had a low economic status relative to the kingdom. A comparison of the economic agreements from other collections in Babylon indicates the integration of the Jews into the economic life of Babylon, and it seems that they operated on the daily economic level, like other Babylonians, and not necessarily according to the [[Halakha|laws of the Torah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lubetski|first1=Meir|title=New Seals and Inscriptions, Hebrew, Idumean, and Cuneiform|date=2007|publisher=Sheffield Phoenix Press|isbn=978-1905048359|pages=206–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and Economic Integration===
Among the exiles, there are documents of a number of Jews of strong economic standing. Some (such as Raphaiah Ben Smachiho and his son) acted as intermediaries and credit providers to the Jewish population and managed to accumulate substantial capital. These intermediaries provided pure silver coins to concentrate tax payments of various Jews and provided farmers with means of production, such as plowing animals and grain.

===Jewish lifestyle and attitude toward Zion===
Due to the nature of the documents, this subject appears only implicitly. The preservation of Jewish identity can be seen in the sequence of names given to family members for at least four generations, the fact that no documents were found on Jewish holidays, and that dates were not signed on Shabbat.

The documents do not show signs of people leaving for Judea, but at least two Jews have been found who had a desire to return to Zion:
* A man named '''Siddur''', apparently given his name in the hope of returning to the Holy Land.
* A man named '''Yaeli''', who points to his parents' desire that he immigrate to Israel. This refers to the concept of "Yael," which is contained in the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] of 538 BCE, and refers to the immigration of exiles to Israel.

The '''alignment level''' in an audio [[signal chain]] or on an [[audio recording]] is a defined anchor point that represents a reasonable or typical level. It does not represent a particular sound level or signal level or digital representation, but it can be defined as corresponding to particular levels in each of these domains.

For example, alignment level is commonly 0 [[dBu]] (Equal to 0.775 Volts RMS) in [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] chains and in professional audio what is commonly known as "0VU", which is +4dBu (Equal to 1.227 Volts RMS) in places where the signal exists as [[analog signal|analogue]] voltage. Under normal situations the "0VU" reference allowed for a headroom of 18dB or more above the reference level without significant distortion. This is largely due to the use of slow responding VU meters in almost all analog professional audio equipment which, by their design, and by specification responded to an average level, not peak levels.  It most commonly is at −18 [[dB FS]] (18 dB below [[full scale]] digital) on digital recordings for programme exchange, in accordance with [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]] recommendations. Digital equipment must use peak reading metering systems to avoid severe digital distortion caused by the signal going beyond 'full scale' or maximum digital levels. 24-bit original or master recordings commonly have alignment level at −24 dB FS to allow extra [[headroom (audio signal processing)|headroom]], which can then be reduced to match the available headroom of the final medium by [[audio level compression]]. FM broadcasts usually have only 9 dB of headroom as recommended by the EBU, but digital broadcasts, which could operate with 18dB of headroom, given their low noise floor even in difficult reception areas, currently operate in a state of confusion, with some transmitting at maximum level while others operate at much lower level even though they carry material that has been compressed for compatibility with the lower dynamic range of FM transmissions.

== Alignment level as used in the EBU ==
The EBU uses the term "alignment level" not for levelling any real audio signals. In the EBU documents "alignment level" just defines -18 dBFS as the level of the Alignment Signal (1 kHz sinus tone generator resp. 997 Hz in the digital domain).

== The reason for alignment level ==

Using alignment level rather than [[maximum permitted level]] as the reference point allows more sensible headroom management throughout the audio chain, so that quality is only sacrificed through [[audio level compression|compression]] as late as possible.

[[Loudness war]]s have caused a general fall in audio quality, initially on radio stations and more recently on CDs. As radio stations competed for attention and to raise the listener scores their ad revenue is based on, they used audio compression to give their sound more impact. They used level compressors, and in particular multi-band compressors that compress different frequencies independently. Such compressors usually incorporate fast acting limiters to eliminate brief peaks, since brief peaks, though they may not contribute much to perceived loudness, limit the modulation level that can be applied to FM transmissions in particular, if serious clipping and distortion are to be avoided. Digital broadcasting has changed all this: stations are no longer found by tuning across the band, so the loudest stations no longer stand out. Low noise level is also guaranteed regardless of signal level, so that it is no longer necessary to fully modulate to ensure acceptable clarity in poor reception areas. Many professionals feel that the more widespread adoption and understanding of alignment level throughout the audio industry could help bring modulation levels down, leaving headroom to cope with brief peaks, and using a different form of level compression that reduces dynamic range on programmes where this is considered desirable, but does not remove the brief peaks which add 'sparkle' and contribute to clearer sound. CDs in particular have suffered a loss of quality since they were introduced through the widespread use of fast limiting, which, given their very low noise level is quite unnecessary.

[[Digital audio players]] such as the [[iPod]], demonstrate the need for a common alignment level. While tracks taken from recent CDs sound loud enough, many older recordings (such as Pink Floyd albums which notably allowed lots of headroom for stunning dynamic range and rarely reach peak digital level) are far too quiet, even at full volume setting. Older audio systems typically incorporated 12dB of 'overvolume', meaning that it was possible to turn up the loudness on a quiet recording to make maximum use of amplifier output even if peak level was never reached on the recording. Modern devices, however, tend to produce maximum output at full volume only on recordings that reach full-scale digital level. If extra gain is added, then playing a modern CD after listening to a well recorded older one is likely to deafen, requiring the volume control to be turned down by a huge amount. Again, the adoption of a common alignment level (early CDs allowed around 18dB of headroom by common consent) would make sense, improving quality and usability and ending the loudness war.

== Making compression a listening option ==

The incorporation of (switchable) level compression in domestic music systems and car in-car systems would allow higher quality on systems capable of wide dynamic range and in situations that allowed realistic reproduction. Such compression systems have been suggested and tried from time to time, but are not in widespread use — a 'chicken and egg' problem since producers feel they must make programmes and recordings that sound good in car with high ambient noise or on cheap low-power music systems. In the [[UK]], some [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] receivers do incorporate a menu setting for automatic loudness compensation which adds extra gain on [[BBC Radio 3]] and [[BBC Radio 4]], to allow for the fact that these programmes adopt lower levels than, for example, the pop station [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]]. Some television receivers also have a menu setting for [[loudness normalisation]], aimed at helping to reduce excessive loudness on advertisements. However, there is no common agreement to reduce compression and limiting and leave these tasks to the receiver.

The '''Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute''', or '''AARI''' ({{lang-ru|Арктический и антарктический научно-исследовательский институт}}, abbreviated as '''ААНИИ''') is the oldest and largest [[Russia]]n research institute in the field of comprehensive studies of [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctica]]. It is located in [[Saint Petersburg]]. 

The AARI has numerous departments, such as those of [[oceanography]], [[glaciology]], [[meteorology]], [[hydrology]] or Arctic river mouths and water resources, [[geophysics]], polar geography, and others. It also has its own computer center, ice research laboratory, experimental workshops, and a museum (the [[Arctic and Antarctic Museum]]). 

Scientists, such as [[Alexander Karpinsky]], [[Alexander Fersman]], [[Yuly Shokalsky]], [[Nikolai Mikhailovich Knipovich|Nikolai Knipovich]], [[Lev Berg]], [[Otto Schmidt]], [[Rudolf Samoylovich]], [[Professor Vize|Vladimir Vize]], [[Nikolai Zubov]], [[Pyotr Shirshov]], [[Nikolai Urvantsev]], and [[Yakov Gakkel]] have all made their valuable contributions to the work of the AARI.

Throughout its history, the AARI has organized more than a thousand Arctic expeditions, including dozens of high-latitude aerial expeditions, which transported 34(?) manned [[Soviet and Russian manned drifting ice stations|drifting ice station]]s ''Severniy Polyus'' ("Северный полюс", or North Pole) to Central Arctic. 
==History==
The AARI was founded on 3 March 1920 as the '''Northern Research and Trade Expedition''' (Северная научно-промысловая экспедиция) under the Scientific and Technical Department of the [[Vesenkha|All-Union Council of State Economy]]. In 1925, the expedition was reorganized into the '''Institute of Northern Studies''' (Институт по изучению Севера) and five years later - into the '''All-Union Arctic Institute''' (Всесоюзный арктический институт). In 1932, the institute was integrated into the [[Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route]] (Главное управление Северного морского пути). In 1948 the Arctic Geology Research Institute (Научно-исследовательский институт геологии Арктики, or НИИГА) was established on the basis of the [[geology]] department of the All-Union Arctic Institute, which would subordinate to the [[Ministry of Geology of the USSR]]. 

In 1955, the AARI participated in the organization of Antarctic research. In 1958, it began to organize and lead all of the Soviet Antarctic expeditions, which would later make many geographic discoveries, and in the same year the [[All-Union]] Arctic Institute was renamed '''Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute'''. In 1963, the AARI was incorporated into the [[Hydrometeorological Service of the USSR|Chief Administration of the Hydrometeorological Service]] (Главное управление Гидрометеослужбы) under the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers of the USSR]] (now [[Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring of Russia]]).

In 1967, AARI was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]]. In 1968, the institute engaged in research of the areas of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] contiguous to the Arctic and Antarctica.

The '''Arkitera Architecture Center''' is an independent [[architecture]] center based in [[Istanbul]] that has been dedicated to sustain a better architectural practice, enhance the architectural culture and to raise the quality of architecture in [[Turkey]].

The center has a different structure than those of the other centers on the world which are either supported by various funds that are reserved for [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] or by governmental institutions. Arkitera works like an NGO that is not dependent on any institution. All the activities and events of the center are planned with regard to the needs and capacities of the architecture setting in Turkey.

Arkitera Architecture Center started their first web publication Arkitera.com, on 9 October 2000 after several months of preparatory work. Following that, other publications and events were also initiated.

Having supported several activities since the time it was founded, the center has collaborated with several firms, institutions and universities and has assigned the role of being a platform to discuss the problems of the built environment and the city. All the events and activities held are realized with the collaboration of various institutions and the sponsorship of several firms. The sponsorship of more than one firm enables the center to remain independent.

Arkitera was awarded with the “Contribution to the Architectural Education” prize by the Turkish Freelance Architects Association (''Turkiye Serbest Mimarlar Dernegi'') in 2004.

The '''Cascade Center at the Riverplex''' is an indoor and outdoor shopping, dining, and entertainment complex located in downtown [[New Castle, Pennsylvania]]. It opened in 2006. Much of the complex sits on the former site of the Cascade, the first movie theater of the [[Warner Bros.]], hence the name. The complex is at the corner of East Washington Street and Mill Street. As of 2013, the complex is owned by Riverplex Partners, Inc. The top three stories are rented by Refresh Dental Management as their corporate headquarters.

==History==
The [[Warner Bros.|Warners]], residents of nearby [[Youngstown, Ohio]], were sons of [[Polish Jew]]s wanting to break into the then-fledgling film business. The brothers, after successfully showing a used copy of ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' at ''[[Idora Park, Youngstown|Idora Park]]'' in Youngstown,&lt;ref&gt;Warner (1964), pp. 49&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt; traveled to New Castle to screen the movie in a vacant store on the site of what would become the Cascade Center.&lt;ref name="Warner54-55"&gt;Warner and Jennings (1964), pp. 54&amp;ndash;55.&lt;/ref&gt; This makeshift theatre, called the Bijou, was furnished with chairs borrowed from a local undertaker.&lt;ref name="ohiomag-march83"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, the brothers purchased a small theater in New Castle near the Bijou, which they called the Cascade Movie Palace, taking its name from nearby [[Cascade Park (amusement park)|Cascade Park]]. They maintained the theater until moving into film distribution in 1907.

Gradually over time, the building that housed the Bijou would host other business while the Cascade itself would eventually be demolished to make way for a [[parking lot]]. The buildings themselves would become abandoned by the 1980s when New Castle, like most other [[Rust Belt]] cities, saw the collapse of the [[steel]] industry having a ripple effect in the region with the population dropping as well as the general [[suburbanization]] effect that had been happening throughout the [[United States]] since the 1950s.

By the mid-1990s, only two businesses were open on the site that would become the Cascade Center. One of them, Main Street Clothiers &amp; Custom Tailors, is a men's [[Suit (clothing)|suit]] shop that was housed in the building that also housed the Bijou. The other would be the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B&amp;O Railroad]] Federal Credit Union, a [[credit union]] that was in a separate purpose-built building on the site bordering Mill Street and the [[Neshannock Creek]] and had actually been built on the site of the Cascade after the site was used as a parking lot.

In 1996, parts of the wall of the building that housed the Bijou collapsed onto East Washington Street, one of the cities main thoroughfares. The portion that collapsed was next door to Main Street Clothiers, which had just opened three years before on the site. The city of New Castle was very close to issuing a [[Occupancy|condemnation]] notice to the building, but at the 11th hour the building's historical significance was discovered, saving the building. The city then announced redevelopment plans to make it what would eventually become the Cascade Center.

==Development==
The city took most of the property by [[eminent domain]] and stabilized the parts of the wall that had collapsed, closing off the [[sidewalk]] in front of the building to prevent accidents until the wall could be completely rebuilt. The city was later able to persuade the B&amp;O Credit Union—now the First Choice Federal Credit Union—to temporarily move into the nearby mall, the Cascade Galleria, so that the property could be bought and made into the Cascade Center. (The credit union eventually moved out of the mall back into their own building out in neighboring [[Union Township, Lawrence County, Pennsylvania|Union Township]].) Main Street Clothiers was allowed to stay in the building where they remain today, and although their portion of the building is not officially part of the Cascade Center they do advertise in the complex, and have even expanded their business by [[screen-printing]] [[T-shirt]]s as well as serving as the area's [[J. C. Penney]] Catalog Center after [[Rite Aid]] acquired [[Eckerd Corporation|Eckerd Pharmacy]] in 2007 and ended the J. C. Penney Catalog Center's in the former Eckerd locations after they were converted to Rite Aid. Coincidentally, Main Street sits next door to a former J. C. Penney (not the side that had the wall collapse) that is currently being remodeled and eventually having a [[coffeehouse|coffee shop]] open in the building.

Although the downtown streets &amp; sidewalks were rebuilt in the early 2000s to resemble the turn of the 19th century, the complex itself wouldn't begin reconstruction until 2003 and was completed in 2006. The interiors of the existing buildings were completely gutted out while the site of the Cascade itself was completely rebuilt into a close replication of the Cascade. Both the old sections and the newly built sections are like one building inside. The city was also able to acquire the former [[Mellon Financial|Mellon Bank]] parking lot and rebuild it as the parking lot for downtown in general and the Cascade Center specifically. The [[alley]] that ran along Neshannock Creek behind the buildings was permanently closed and added on to the property of the complex, which became a [[Esplanade|promenade]] that leads to an outdoor [[Amphitheatre|amphitheater]] between the former J. C. Penney building and the creek along East Washington Street. The northern terminus of [[Pennsylvania Route 65]] (which runs along East Washington Street) was extended over a mile to near the complex on the other side of the creek.

Much like [[Station Square]] in [[Pittsburgh]], the complex is an example of [[adaptive reuse]], and focuses on the early years of [[Film|motion pictures]] much like Station Square focuses on [[train]]s. The complex largely remains vacant, although businesses have started to open up and events being held both inside the complex and at the amphitheater. The complex has also help draw businesses to downtown.

Despite the historical connection to the Warner Bros. studio, the complex has no association with [[Time Warner]], the current parent company of Warner Bros. Entertainment. Cass Warner, the granddaughter of [[Harry Warner]], did visit the complex just before it officially opened in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncnewsonline.com/archivesearch/local_story_112013504?start:int=30{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tenants==
Although at one point the complex had three tenants, in 2010 all three closed for unknown reasons and the complex was put up for sale. The outdoor promenade and amphitheater, which are publicly owned, are still used by the city for downtown events.
 
It should also be noted that Main Street Clothiers and Custom Tailors, while in the building where the Cascade Center is located, is not an official part of the complex, since it has outdoor access only instead of indoor access like the rest of the businesses and also was pre-existing before the creation of the complex.

Reinvestment in the center has picked up in recent years, with the Two Rivers Coffee Shop and The Commonwealth restaurant both opening in 2014.

In molecular biology, the '''Cfr10I/Bse634I''' family of [[restriction endonucleases]] includes the type II restriction endonucleases Cfr10I and Bse634I. They exhibit a [[conserved sequence|conserved]] tetrameric architecture that is of functional importance, wherein two [[protein dimer|dimers]] are arranged, back-to-back, with their putative DNA-binding clefts facing opposite directions. These clefts are formed between two [[monomer]]s that interact, mainly via [[hydrophobic]] interactions supported by a few hydrogen bonds, to form a U-shaped [[protein dimer|dimer]]. Each monomer is [[protein folding|folded]] to form a compact alpha-beta structure, whose core is made up of a five-stranded mixed [[beta-sheet]]. The monomer may be split into separate N-terminal and C-terminal subdomains at a hinge located in [[helix]] alpha3.&lt;ref name="pmid11842098"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grazulis S, Deibert M, Rimseliene R, Skirgaila R, Sasnauskas G, Lagunavicius A, Repin V, Urbanke C, Huber R, Siksnys V | title = Crystal structure of the Bse634I restriction endonuclease: comparison of two enzymes recognizing the same DNA sequence | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 876–85 |date=February 2002 | pmid = 11842098 | pmc = 100338 | doi = 10.1093/nar/30.4.876| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Cfr10I and Bse634I recognise the double-stranded [[Nucleotide sequence|sequence]] RCCGGY and cleave after the [[purine]] R.&lt;ref name="pmid8568865"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bozic D, Grazulis S, Siksnys V, Huber R | title = Crystal structure of Citrobacter freundii restriction endonuclease Cfr10I at 2.15 A resolution | journal = J.

In [[telecommunication]], a '''combined distribution frame''' (CDF) is a [[distribution frame]] that combines the functions of [[Main distribution frame|main]] and [[intermediate distribution frame]]s and contains both vertical and horizontal terminating blocks.  

The vertical blocks are used to terminate the permanent outside lines entering the station. Horizontal blocks are used to terminate [[inside plant]] equipment. This arrangement permits the association of any outside [[telephone line|line]] with any desired [[terminal equipment]]. These connections are made either with twisted pair wire, normally referred to as jumper wire, or with [[optical fiber]] cables, normally referred to as jumper cables. 

In technical control facilities, the vertical side may be used to terminate equipment as well as outside lines. The horizontal side is then used for [[Patch panel|jackfields]] and battery terminations.

'''C5a''' is a protein fragment released from cleavage of [[Complement component 5|complement component C5]] by protease [[C5-convertase]] into C5a and C5b fragments. C5b is important in late events of the complement cascade, an orderly series of reactions which coordinates several basic defense mechanisms, including formation of the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC), one of the most basic weapons of the innate immune system, formed as an automatic response to intrusions from foreign particles and microbial invaders. It essentially pokes microscopic pinholes in these foreign objects, causing loss of water and sometimes death. C5a, the other cleavage product of C5, acts as a highly inflammatory peptide, encouraging complement activation, formation of the MAC, attraction of innate immune cells, and histamine release involved in allergic responses. The origin of C5 is in the hepatocyte, but its synthesis can also be found in macrophages, where it may cause local increase of C5a. C5a is a chemotactic agent and an anaphylatoxin; it is essential in the innate immunity but it is also linked with the adaptive immunity. The increased production of C5a is connected with a number of inflammatory diseases.&lt;ref name="pmid19464229"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Manthey HD, Woodruff TM, Taylor SM, Monk PN | title=Complement component 5a (C5a) | journal=Int J Biochem Cell Biol | year= 2009 | volume= 41 | issue= 11 | pages= 2114–7 | doi=10.1016/j.biocel.2009.04.005 | pmc= | pmid=19464229  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Human polypeptide C5a contains 74 amino acids and has 11kDa. NMR spectroscopy proved that the molecule is composed of four helices and connected by peptide loops with three disulphide bonds between helix IV and II, III.  There is a short 1.5 turn helix on N terminus but all agonist activity take place in the C terminus. C5a is rapidly metabolised by a serum enzyme [[carboxypeptidase B]] to a 72 amino acid form C5a des-Arg without C terminal arginine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Andreas Klos |author2=Elisabeth Wende |author3=Kathryn J.

==Functions==
C5a is an [[anaphylatoxin]], causing increased expression of adhesion molecules on endothelium, contraction of smooth muscle, and increased vascular permeability. C5a des-Arg is a much less potent anaphylatoxin. Both C5a and C5a des-Arg can trigger [[mast cell]] degranulation, releasing proinflammatory molecules [[histamine]] and [[TNF-α]]. C5a is also an effective [[Chemotaxis#Chemotactic ligands|chemoattractant]], initiating accumulation of complement and phagocytic cells at sites of infection or recruitment of antigen-presenting cells to lymph nodes.
C5a plays a key role in increasing migration and adherence of neutrophils and monocytes to vessel walls. White blood cells are activated by upregulation of [[integrin]] [[avidity]], the [[Prostaglandin#Biosynthesis|lipoxygenase pathway]] and [[arachidonic acid]] metabolism.
C5a also modulates the balance between activating versus inhibitory [[IgG]] [[Fc receptor]]s on leukocytes, thereby enhancing the [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune]] response.&lt;ref name="pmid19464229"/&gt;

==Binding process==
C5a interact with [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] protein C5aR ([[CD88]]) on the surface of target cells such as macrophages, neutrophils and endothelial cells. C5aR is a member of the [[G-protein-coupled receptor]] superfamily of proteins, predicted to have seven transmembrane helical domains of largely hydrophobic [[amino acid]] residues, forming three intra- and three extra-cellular loops, with an extracellular N-terminus and an intracellular C-terminus.

C5a binding to the receptor is a two-stage process: an interaction between basic residues in the helical core of C5a and acidic residues in the extracellular N-terminal domain allows the C-terminus of C5a to bind to residues in the receptor transmembrane domains. The latter interaction leads to receptor activation, and the transduction of the ligand binding signal across the cell [[plasma membrane]] to the cytoplasmic G protein [[Gi alpha subunit|G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]] type [[GNAI2]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mpr.nci.nih.gov/prow/guide/666919736_g.htm PROW and IWHLDA present the GUIDE on: CD88] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724181852/http://mpr.nci.nih.gov/prow/guide/666919736_g.htm |date=2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensitivity of C5aR to C5a stimulation is enhanced by Lipopolysaccharides exposure, yet this is not due to C5aR upregulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Raby AC, Holst B, Davies J, Colmont C, Laumonnier Y, Coles B, Shah S, Hall J, Topley N, Khol J, Morgan BP, Labeta MO | title= TLR activation enhances C5a-induced pro-inflammatory responses by negatively modulating the second C5a receptor, C5L2| journal= European Journal of Immunology | year= 2011| volume= 41| pages=2741–2752 | doi= 10.1002/eji.201041350 | pmid= 21630250 | issue= 9 | pmc= 3638321}}&lt;/ref&gt; C5L2 is another C5a receptor that is thought to regulate the C5a-C5aR effects. There is apparently contradictory evidence showing decoy receptor activity conferring anti-inflammatory properties and also signalling activity conferring pro-inflammatory properties.&lt;ref name="pmid= 23383423"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Klos A, Wende E, Wareham KJ, Monk PN |title=International Union of Pharmacology.

==Diseases==
C5a is a powerful inflammatory mediator, and seems to be a key factor in the development of pathology of many inflammatory diseases involving the complement system such as sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythemotosis, psoriasis. The inhibitor of C5a that can block its effects would be helpful in medical applications.

The '''ecological footprint''' measures human demand on nature, i.e., the quantity of nature it takes to support people or an economy. It tracks this demand through an [[ecological accounting]] system. The accounts contrast the biologically productive area people use for their consumption to the biologically productive area available within a region or the world ([[biocapacity]], the productive area that can regenerate what people demand from nature). In short, it is a measure of [[Human impact on the environment|human impact on Earth's ecosystem]] and reveals the dependence of the human economy on [[natural capital]].

The ecological footprint is defined as the biologically productive area needed to provide for everything people use: fruits and vegetables, fish, wood, fibers, absorption of carbon dioxide from [[fossil fuel]] use, and space for buildings and roads.

Footprint and biocapacity can be compared at the individual, regional, national or global scale. Both footprint and biocapacity change every year with number of people, per person consumption, efficiency of production, and productivity of ecosystems. At a global scale, footprint assessments show how big humanity's demand is compared to what planet [[Earth]] can renew. Since 2003, [[Global Footprint Network]] has calculated the ecological footprint from UN data sources for the world as a whole and for over 200 nations (known as the National Footprint Accounts). Every year the calculations are updated with the newest data. The time series are recalculated with every update since UN statistics also change historical data sets. As shown in Lin et al (2018)&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt; the time trends for countries and the world have stayed consistent despite data updates. Also, a recent study by the Swiss Ministry of Environment independently recalculated the Swiss trends and reproduced them within 1-4% for the time period that they studied (1996-2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Footprints of Switzerland|last=|first=|publisher=Federal Office for the Environment|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Global Footprint Network estimates that, as of 2014, humanity has been using [[natural capital]] 1.7 times as fast as Earth can renew it.&lt;ref name="Data Sources"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.footprintnetwork.org/|title=Data Sources|date=2017-04-17|publisher=Global Footprint Network|accessdate=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org"&gt;Lin, D; Hanscom, L; Murthy, A; Galli, A; Evans, M; Neill, E; Mancini, MS; Martindill, J; Medouar, F-Z; Huang, S; Wackernagel, M.

==Footprint measurements and methodology==
[[File:Blue Marble Western Hemisphere.jpg|thumb|The [[natural resource]]s of [[Earth]] are [[non-renewable resource|finite]], and unsustainably strained by current levels of human activity.]] For 2014, Global Footprint Network estimated humanity's ecological footprint as 1.7 planet Earths. This means that, according to their calculations, humanity's demands were 1.7 times faster than what the planet's ecosystems renewed.&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.footprintnetwork.org|title=Open Data Platform|website=data.footprintnetwork.org|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecological footprints can be calculated at any scale: for an activity, a person, a community, a city, a town, a region, a nation, or humanity as a whole. Cities, due to their [[population density|population concentration]], have large ecological footprints and have become ground zero for footprint reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/8154513/Architecture_of_the_Anthropocene|work=academia.edu|title=Most poignantly... cities in the Anthropocene will remain the ‘ground zero'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecological footprint accounting method at the national level is described on the web page of Global Footprint Network &lt;ref name="Methodology and Data"&gt;{{cite web|title=Methodology and Data |url=https://www.footprintnetwork.org/resources/data/|publisher=Global Footprint Network|accessdate=15 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or in greater detail in academic papers, including Borucke et al.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borucke |first1=M |last2=Moore |first2=D |last3=Cranston |first3=G |last4=Gracey |first4=K |last5=Lazarus |first5=E |last6=Morales |first6=J.C. |last7=Wackernagel |first7=M. |title=Accounting for demand and supply of the biosphere’s regenerative capacity: The National Footprint Accounts’ underlying methodology and framework |journal=Ecological Indicators |date=2013 |volume=24 |pages=518–533 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The National Accounts Review Committee has also published a research agenda on how to improve the accounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brass.cf.ac.uk/uploads/fullpapers/Kitzes_et_al_M65.pdf A Research Agenda for Improving National Ecological Footprint Accounts] Retrieved: 2007-11-11 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128200301/http://www.brass.cf.ac.uk/uploads/fullpapers/Kitzes_et_al_M65.pdf |date=November 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The first academic publication about ecological footprints was by [[William Rees (academic)|William Rees]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rees |first=William E. |authorlink=William Rees (academic) |date=October 1992 |title=Ecological footprints and appropriated carrying capacity: what urban economics leaves out |journal=Environment and Urbanisation |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=121–130 |doi=10.1177/095624789200400212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecological footprint concept and calculation method was developed as the PhD dissertation of [[Mathis Wackernagel]], under Rees' supervision at the [[University of British Columbia]] in Vancouver, Canada, from 1990–1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |degree=PhD |title=Ecological Footprint and Appropriated Carrying Capacity: A Tool for Planning Toward Sustainability |author=Wackernagel, M. |year=1994 |publisher=School of Community and Regional Planning. The University of British Columbia |location=Vancouver, Canada |url=https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/7132/ubc_1994-954027.pdf?sequence=1 |format=PDF |oclc=41839429 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, Wackernagel and Rees called the concept "appropriated carrying capacity".&lt;ref&gt;Wackernagel, Mathis, 1991. "Land Use: Measuring a Community's Appropriated Carrying Capacity as an Indicator for Sustainability"; and "Using Appropriated Carrying Capacity as an Indicator, Measuring the Sustainability of a Community." Report I &amp; II to the UBC Task Force on Healthy and Sustainable Communities, Vancouver.&lt;/ref&gt; To make the idea more accessible, Rees came up with the term "ecological footprint", inspired by a computer technician who praised his new computer's "small footprint on the desk".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/magazine/17wwln-safire-t.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;adxnnlx=1229007727-rHeHNAWQ6qCKYwJ6WbOsVg William Safire, On Language]: Footprint, New York Times Magazine, February 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1996, Wackernagel and Rees published the book ''Our Ecological Footprint: Reducing Human Impact on the Earth'' with illustrations by Phil Testemale.&lt;ref name="Wackernagel &amp; Rees" /&gt;

Footprint values at the end of a survey are categorized for Carbon, Food, Housing, and Goods and Services as well as the total footprint number of Earths needed to sustain the world's population at that level of consumption. This approach can also be applied to an activity such as the manufacturing of a product or driving of a car. This resource accounting is similar to [[life-cycle assessment|life-cycle analysis]] wherein the consumption of [[energy]], [[biomass]] ([[food]], [[fiber]]), [[building material]], [[water]] and other [[natural resource|resources]] are converted into a normalized measure of land area called [[global hectare]]s (gha).

Per capita ecological footprint (EF), or ecological footprint analysis (EFA), is a means of comparing consumption and lifestyles, and checking this against nature's ability to provide for this consumption. The tool can inform policy by examining to what extent a nation uses more (or less) than is available within its territory, or to what extent the nation's lifestyle would be replicable worldwide. The footprint can also be a useful tool to educate people about [[carrying capacity]] and [[overconsumption]], with the aim of altering personal behavior. Ecological footprints may be used to argue that many current lifestyles are not [[sustainable development|sustainable]]. Such a global comparison also clearly shows the inequalities of resource use on this planet at the beginning of the twenty-first century.

In 2007, the average biologically productive area per person worldwide was approximately 1.8 [[global hectare]]s (gha) per capita. The [[United States|U.S.]] footprint per capita was 9.0 gha, and that of [[Switzerland]] was 5.6 gha, while [[China]]'s was 1.8 gha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/footprint_for_nations] or [http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/newsletter/bv/new_data_shows_humanitys_ecological_debt_compounding] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129104811/http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/newsletter/bv/new_data_shows_humanitys_ecological_debt_compounding |date=2009-01-29 }} Living Planet Report 2008 outlines scenarios for humanity's future.

Best Foot Forward. {{ISBN|0-9546042-0-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] claims that the human footprint has exceeded the [[biocapacity]] (the available supply of natural resources) of the planet by 20%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6077798.stm Global ecosystems 'face collapse'] BBC News. Retrieved: 2007-05-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Wackernagel and Rees originally estimated that the available biological capacity for the 6 billion people on Earth at that time was about 1.3 hectares per person, which is smaller than the 1.8 global hectares published for 2006, because the initial studies neither used global hectares nor included bioproductive marine areas.&lt;ref name="Wackernagel &amp; Rees"&gt;Wackernagel, Mathis &amp; Rees, William (1996)"Our Ecological Footprint" (New Society Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of NGOs offer ecological footprint calculators (''see'' [[#External links|Footprint Calculator]], below).

== Global trends in humanity's ecological footprint ==
According to the 2018 edition of the National Footprint Accounts, humanity’s total ecological footprint has exhibited an increasing trend since 1961, growing an average of 2.1% per year (SD= 1.9)&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;. Humanity’s ecological footprint was 7.0 billion gha in 1961 and increased to 20.6 billion gha in 2014&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;. The world-average ecological footprint in 2014 was 2.8 global hectares per person&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;. The carbon footprint is the fastest growing part of the ecological footprint and accounts currently for about 60% of humanity’s total ecological footprint&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;.

The Earth’s biocapacity has not increased at the same rate as the ecological footprint. The increase of biocapacity averaged at only 0.5% per year (SD = 0.7)&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;. Because of agricultural intensification, biocapacity was at 9.6 billion gha in 1961 and grew to 12.2 billion gha in 2014&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;. 

Therefore, the Earth has been in ecological overshoot (where humanity is using more resources and generating waste at a pace that the ecosystem can’t renew) since the 1970’s&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;. In 2018, [[Earth Overshoot Day]], the date where humanity has used more from nature then the planet can renew in the entire year, was estimated to be August 1&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.footprintnetwork.org/our-work/earth-overshoot-day/|title=Earth Overshoot Day|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Now more than 85% of humanity live in countries that run an ecological deficit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.footprintnetwork.org/our-work/ecological-footprint/|title=Ecological Footprint|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This means their ecological footprint for consumption exceeds the biocapacity of that country. 

==Studies in the United Kingdom==
The UK's average ecological footprint is 5.45 [[global hectare]]s per capita (gha) with variations between regions ranging from 4.80 gha (Wales) to 5.56 gha (East England).&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;

Two recent studies{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} have examined relatively low-impact small communities. [[BedZED]], a 96-home [[mixed-income housing]] development in South [[London]], was designed by Bill Dunster Architects and sustainability consultants BioRegional for the [[Peabody Trust]]. Despite being populated by relatively "mainstream" home-buyers, BedZED was found to have a footprint of 3.20 gha due to on-site renewable energy production, energy-efficient architecture, and an extensive green lifestyles program that included on-site London's first [[carsharing]] club. The report did not measure the added footprint of the 15,000 visitors who have toured BedZED since its completion in 2002. [[Findhorn Ecovillage]], a rural [[intentional community]] in [[Moray]], [[Scotland]], had a total footprint of 2.56 gha, including both the many guests and visitors who travel to the community to undertake residential courses there and the nearby campus of [[Cluny Hill]] College. However, the residents alone have a footprint of 2.71 gha, a little over half the UK national average and one of the lowest ecological footprints of any community measured so far in the industrialized world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1596647.0.findhorn_ecofootprint_is_worlds_smallest.php Findhorn eco-footprint is ‘world’s smallest’] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123092120/http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1596647.0.findhorn_ecofootprint_is_worlds_smallest.php |date=2009-01-23 }} ''[[Sunday Herald]]'', August 11, 2008.

==Ecological footprint at the individual level==

In a 2012 study of consumers acting "green" vs. "brown" (where green people are «expected to have significantly lower ecological impact than “brown” consumers»), the conclusion was "the research found no significant difference between the carbon footprints of green and brown consumers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alden Wicker|title=Conscious consumerism is a lie.

Grazi et al. (2007) have performed a systematic comparison of the ecological footprint method with spatial welfare analysis that includes environmental [[externality|externalities]], agglomeration effects and trade advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=F. Grazi |author2=J.C.J.M. van den Bergh |author3=P.

However this should not be surprising, since the two methods address different research questions.

[[Peter Newman (environmental scientist)|Newman]] (2006) has argued that the ecological footprint concept may have an anti-urban bias, as it does not consider the opportunities created by urban growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Peter|date=October 2006|title=The environmental impact of cities|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956247806069599|journal=Environment and Urbanization|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=275–295|doi=10.1177/0956247806069599|issn=0956-2478}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calculating the ecological footprint for densely populated areas, such as a city or small country with a comparatively large population — e.g. New York and Singapore respectively — may lead to the perception of these populations as "parasitic". This is because these communities have little intrinsic biocapacity, and instead must rely upon large ''[[hinterland]]s''. Critics argue that this is a dubious characterization since mechanized rural farmers in developed nations may easily consume more resources than urban inhabitants, due to transportation requirements and the unavailability of [[economies of scale]]. Furthermore, such moral conclusions seem to be an argument for [[autarky]]. Some even take this train of thought a step further, claiming that the Footprint denies the benefits of trade. &lt;!-- which it does not, I'll try to track down Wackernagel's piece on this, it's somewhere on my hard drive. belg4mit --&gt; Therefore, the critics argue that the Footprint can only be applied globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume1/v1i1a2print.html |title=Planning and Markets: Peter Gordon and Harry W. Richardson |publisher=Pam.usc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Something about per capita EF of a nation vs. fairshare should be mentioned here as a counterpoint. i.e; it can provide a frame of reference as to justness --&gt;

The method seems to reward the replacement of original ecosystems with high-productivity agricultural [[monoculture]]s by assigning a higher biocapacity to such regions. For example, replacing ancient woodlands or tropical forests with monoculture forests or plantations may improve the ecological footprint. Similarly, if [[organic farming]] yields were lower than those of conventional methods, this could result in the former being "penalized" with a larger ecological footprint.&lt;ref&gt;Lenzen, M., C. Borgstrom Hansson and S. Bond (2006) [http://www.isa.org.usyd.edu.au/publications/documents/ISA&amp;WWF_Bioproductivity&amp;LandDisturbance.pdf On the bioproductivity and land-disturbance metrics of the Ecological Footprint]. University of Sydney, ISA Research Paper, June, 06, in collaboration with WWF. Retrieved: 2007-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, this insight, while valid, stems from the idea of using the footprint as one's only metric. If the use of ecological footprints are complemented with other indicators, such as one for [[biodiversity]], the problem might be solved. Indeed, [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]'s [[Living Planet Index|Living Planet Report]] complements the biennial Footprint calculations with the Living Planet Index of biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Loh, J., R.

Although the ecological footprint model prior to 2008 treated [[nuclear power]] in the same manner as coal power,&lt;ref name="Questions and Answers"&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090629075214/http://www.footprintnetwork.org/gfn_sub.php?content=faq Questions and Answers], Global Footprint Network&lt;/ref&gt; the actual real world effects of the two are radically different.

[[Image:Greenhouse emissions by electricity source.PNG|500px|right|The Vattenfall study found Nuclear, Hydro, and Wind to have far less greenhouse emissions than other sources represented.]]

The Swedish utility [[Vattenfall]] did a study of full [[life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources]] the utility uses to produce electricity, namely: Nuclear, Hydro, Coal, Gas, Solar Cell, Peat and Wind. The net result of the study was that nuclear power produced 3.3&amp;nbsp;grams of carbon dioxide per kW⋅h of produced power. This compares to 400 for [[natural gas]] and 700 for [[coal]] (according to this study). The study also concluded that nuclear power produced the smallest amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of any of their electricity sources.&lt;ref&gt;nuclearinfo.net.

The world-average ecological footprint in 2013 was 2.8 global hectares per person.&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org"/&gt; The average per country ranges from over 10 to under 1 global hectares per person. There is also a high variation within countries, based on individual lifestyle and economic possibilities.&lt;ref name="Humanity Now Demanding 1.6 Earths"&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanity Now Demanding 1.6 Earths|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/our-work/ecological-footprint/|website=Global Footprint Network|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[GHG footprint]] or the more narrow [[carbon footprint]] are a component of the ecological footprint. Often, when only the carbon footprint is reported, it is expressed in weight of CO2 (or CO2e representing GHG warming potential (GGWP)), but it can also be expressed in land areas like ecological footprints. Both can be applied to products, people or whole societies.&lt;ref name="Guidance on how to measure and report your greenhouse gas emissions"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benn|first1=Hilary|last2=Milliband|first2=Ed|title=Guidance on how to measure and report your greenhouse gas emissions|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/69282/pb13309-ghg-guidance-0909011.pdf|website=GOV.UK|publisher=Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (UK)|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55705">'''Enactivism''' argues that [[cognition]] arises through a dynamic interaction between an acting [[organism]] and its environment.&lt;ref name="Evan Thompson"/&gt; It claims that our environment is one which we selectively create through our capacities to interact with the world.&lt;ref name=Rowlands/&gt; "Organisms do not passively receive information from their environments, which they then translate into internal representations. Natural cognitive systems...participate in the generation of meaning ...engaging in transformational and not merely informational interactions: ''they enact a world''."&lt;ref name=Jaegher1/&gt; These authors suggest that the increasing emphasis upon enactive terminology presages a new era in thinking about cognitive science.&lt;ref name=Jaegher1/&gt; How the actions involved in enactivism relate to age-old questions about [[free will]] remains a topic of active debate.&lt;ref name=Manetti/&gt;

The term 'enactivism' is close in meaning to 'enaction', defined as "the manner in which a subject of perception creatively matches its actions to the requirements of its situation".&lt;ref name=Tascano0/&gt; The introduction of the term ''enaction'' in this context is attributed to  [[Francisco Varela]], [[Evan Thompson]], and [[Eleanor Rosch]],&lt;ref name=Tascano0/&gt;&lt;ref name=RWilson/&gt; who proposed the name to "emphasize the growing conviction that cognition is not the representation of a pre-given world by a pre-given mind but is rather the enactment of a world and a mind on the basis of a history of the variety of actions that a being in the world performs".&lt;ref name=Varela/&gt; This was further developed by Thompson and others,&lt;ref name="Evan Thompson"/&gt; to place emphasis upon the idea that experience of the world is a result of mutual interaction between the sensorimotor capacities of the organism and its environment.&lt;ref name=RWilson/&gt;

The initial emphasis of enactivism upon sensorimotor skills has been criticized as "cognitively marginal",&lt;ref name=ClarkA/&gt; but it has been extended to apply to higher level cognitive activities, such as social interactions.&lt;ref name="Jaegher1"/&gt; "In the enactive view,... knowledge is constructed: it is constructed by an agent through its sensorimotor interactions with its environment, co-constructed between and within living species through their meaningful interaction with each other. In its most abstract form, knowledge is co-constructed between human individuals in socio-linguistic interactions...Science is a particular form of social knowledge construction...[that] allows us to perceive and predict events beyond our immediate cognitive grasp...and also to construct further, even more powerful scientific knowledge."&lt;ref name=Rohde/&gt;

Enactivism is closely related to [[situated cognition]] and [[embodied cognition]], and is presented as an alternative to [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], [[computationalism]], and [[Cartesian dualism]].

==Philosophical aspects&lt;!--'Enaction (philosophy)' redirects here--&gt;==

Enactivism is one of  a cluster of related theories sometimes known as the ''4Es''.&lt;ref name=Gallagher/&gt; As described by [[Mark Rowlands]], mental processes are:
* '''Embodied''' involving more than the brain, including a more general involvement of bodily structures and processes.
* '''Embedded''' functioning only in a related external environment.
* '''Enacted''' involving not only neural processes, but also things an organism ''does''.
* '''Extended''' into the organism's environment.

Enactivism proposes an alternative to [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] as a philosophy of mind, in that it emphasises the interactions between mind, body and the environment, seeing them all as inseparably intertwined in mental processes.&lt;ref name=EThompson/&gt; The self arises as part of the process of an embodied entity interacting with the environment in precise ways determined by its physiology.   In this sense, individuals can be seen to "grow into" or arise from their interactive role with the world.&lt;ref name=Burman/&gt;
:"Enaction is the idea that organisms create their own experience through their actions. Organisms are not passive receivers of input from the environment, but are actors in the environment such that what they experience is shaped by how they act."&lt;ref name=Hutchins/&gt;

In ''The Tree of Knowledge'' Maturana &amp; Varela proposed the term ''enactive''&lt;ref name=Maturana/&gt; "to evoke the view of knowledge that what is known is brought forth, in contraposition to the more classical views of either cognitivism&lt;ref group=Note name=Cognitivism/&gt; or connectionism.&lt;ref group=Note name=Connectionism/&gt; They see enactivism as providing a middle ground between the two extremes of [[representationalism]] and [[solipsism]]. They seek to "confront the problem of understanding how our existence-the [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] of our living- is coupled to a surrounding world which appears filled with regularities that are at every instant the result of our biological and social histories.... to find a ''via media'': to understand the regularity of the world we are experiencing at every moment, but without any point of reference independent of ourselves that would give certainty to our descriptions and cognitive assertions.  Indeed the whole mechanism of generating ourselves, as describers and observers tells us that our world, as the world which we bring forth in our coexistence with others, will always have precisely that mixture of regularity and mutability, that combination of solidity and shifting sand, so typical of human experience when we look at it up close."[''Tree of Knowledge'', p.&amp;nbsp;241]

Enactivism also addresses the [[hard problem of consciousness]], referred to by Thompson as part of the ''[[explanatory gap]]'' in explaining how consciousness and subjective experience are related to brain and body.&lt;ref name=EThompson2/&gt;  "The problem with the dualistic concepts of consciousness and life in standard formulations of the hard problem is that they exclude each other by construction".&lt;ref name=EThompson3/&gt; Instead, according to Thompson's view of enactivism, the study of consciousness or [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] as exemplified by [[Husserl]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]] is to complement science and its objectification of the world. "The whole universe of science is built upon the world as directly experienced, and if we want to subject science itself to rigorous scrutiny and arrive at a precise assessment of its meaning and scope, we must begin by reawakening the basic experience of the world of which science is the second-order expression" (Merleau-Ponty, ''The phenomenology of perception'' as quoted by Thompson, p.&amp;nbsp;165). In this interpretation, enactivism asserts that science is formed or enacted as part of humankind's interactivity with its world, and by embracing phenomenology "science itself is properly situated in relation to the rest of human life and is thereby secured on a sounder footing."&lt;ref name=EThompson4/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldwin/&gt;

Enaction has been seen as a move to conjoin [[representationalism]] with [[phenomenalism]], that is, as adopting a [[constructivist epistemology]], an epistemology centered upon the active participation of the subject in constructing reality.&lt;ref name=Mutelesi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chiari/&gt; However, 'constructivism' focuses upon more than a simple 'interactivity' that could be described as a minor adjustment to 'assimilate' reality or 'accommodate' to it.&lt;ref name=Glaserfeld/&gt; Constructivism looks upon interactivity as a radical, creative, revisionist process in which the knower ''constructs'' a personal 'knowledge system' based upon their experience and tested by its viability in practical encounters with their environment. Learning is a result of perceived anomalies that produce dissatisfaction with existing conceptions.&lt;ref name=Glasersfeld2/&gt;

How does constructivism relate to enactivism? From the above remarks it can be seen that [[Ernst von Glasersfeld|Glasersfeld]] expresses an interactivity between the knower and the known quite acceptable to an enactivist, but does not emphasize  the structured probing of the environment by the knower that leads to the "perturbation relative to some expected result" that then leads to a new understanding.&lt;ref name=Glasersfeld2/&gt; It is this probing activity, especially where it is not accidental but deliberate, that characterizes enaction, and invokes ''affect'',&lt;ref name=Ward2/&gt; that is, the motivation and planning that lead to doing and to fashioning the probing, both observing and modifying the environment, so that "perceptions and nature condition one another through generating one another."&lt;ref name=Diettrich/&gt; The questioning nature of this probing activity is not an emphasis of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] and Glasersfeld.

Sharing enactivism's stress upon both action and embodiment in the incorporation of knowledge, but giving Glasersfeld's mechanism of viability an [[Introduction to evolution|evolutionary]] emphasis,&lt;ref name=Diettrich2/&gt; is [[evolutionary epistemology]]. Inasmuch as an organism must reflect its environment well enough for the organism to be able to survive in it, and to be competitive enough to be able to reproduce at sustainable rate, the structure and reflexes of the organism itself embody knowledge of its environment. This biology-inspired theory of the growth of knowledge is closely tied to [[universal Darwinism]], and is associated with evolutionary epistemologists such as [[Karl Popper]], [[Donald T. Campbell]], [[Peter Munz]], and [[Gary Cziko]].&lt;ref name=Gontier/&gt; According to Munz, "an organism is an ''embodied theory'' about its environment... Embodied theories are also no longer expressed in language, but in anatomical structures or reflex responses, etc."&lt;ref name=Gontier/&gt;&lt;ref name=Munz/&gt;

===Enactive views of perception===
In the enactive view, perception "is not conceived as the transmission of information but more as an exploration of the world by various means. Cognition is not tied into the workings of an 'inner mind', some cognitive core, but occurs in directed interaction between the body and the world it inhabits."&lt;ref name=McGann2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alva Noë]] in advocating an enactive view of perception&lt;ref name=Noe&gt;
{{cite book |author=Alva Noë |title= Action in Perception |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFKvU2hPhxEC&amp;pg=PA1 |pages=1 ''ff'' |chapter=Chapter 1: The enactive approach to perception: An introduction |isbn=9780262140881 |year=2004 |publisher=MIT Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt; sought to resolve how we perceive three-dimensional objects, on the basis of two-dimensional input.  He argues that we perceive this solidity (or 'volumetricity') by appealing to patterns of sensorimotor expectations. These arise from our agent-active  'movements and interaction' with objects, or 'object-active' changes in the object itself. The solidity is perceived through our expectations and skills in knowing how the object's appearance would change with changes in how we relate to it. He saw all perception as an active exploration of the world, rather than being a passive process, something which happens to us.

Noë's idea of the role of 'expectations' in three-dimensional perception has been opposed by several philosophers, notably by [[Andy Clark]].&lt;ref name=ClarkA1/&gt; Clark points to difficulties of the enactive approach.  He points to internal processing of visual signals, for example, in the ventral and dorsal pathways, [[Two-streams hypothesis|the two-streams hypothesis]]. This results in an integrated perception of objects (their recognition and location, respectively) yet this processing cannot be described as an action or actions. In a more general criticism, Clark suggests that perception is not a matter of expectations about sensorimotor mechanisms guiding perception. Rather, although the limitations of sensorimotor mechanisms constrain perception, this sensorimotor activity is drastically filtered to fit current needs and purposes of the organism, and it is these imposed 'expectations' that govern perception, filtering for the 'relevant' details of sensorimotor input (called "sensorimotor summarizing").&lt;ref name=ClarkA1/&gt;

These sensorimotor-centered and purpose-centered views appear to agree on the general scheme but disagree on the dominance issue – is the dominant component peripheral or central. Another view, the closed-loop perception one, assigns equal a-priori dominance to the peripheral and central components. In closed-loop perception, perception emerges through the process of inclusion of an item in a motor-sensory-motor loop, i.e., a loop (or loops) connecting the peripheral and central components that are relevant to that item. The item can be a body part (in which case the loops are in steady-state) or an external object (in which case the loops are perturbed and gradually converge to a steady state). These enactive loops are always active, switching dominance by the need.

Another application of enaction to perception is analysis of the human hand. The many remarkably demanding uses of the hand are not learned by instruction, but through a history of engagements that lead to the acquisition of skills. According to one interpretation, it is suggested that "the hand [is]...an organ of cognition", not a faithful subordinate working under top-down instruction, but a partner in a "bi-directional interplay between manual and brain activity."&lt;ref name="Hutto"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Daniel Hutto]]: "Enactivists are concerned to defend the view that our most elementary ways of engaging with the world and others - including our basic forms of perception and perceptual experience - are mindful in the sense of being phenomenally charged and intentionally directed, despite being non-representational and content-free."&lt;ref name="Hutto2"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Hutto calls this position 'REC' (&lt;u&gt;R&lt;/u&gt;adical &lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;nactive &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;ognition): "According to REC, there is no way to distinguish neural activity that is imagined to be genuinely content involving (and thus truly mental, truly cognitive) from other non-neural activity that merely plays a supporting or enabling role in making mind and cognition possible."&lt;ref name="Hutto2" /&gt;

===Participatory sense-making===

[[Hanne De Jaegher]] and [[Ezequiel Di Paolo]] (2007)&lt;ref name="DeJaeger0"/&gt; have extended the enactive concept of sense-making&lt;ref name="EThompson3"/&gt; into the social domain. The idea takes as its departure point the process of interaction between individuals in a social encounter.&lt;ref name=DeJaegher_etal&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hanne De Jaegher |author2=Ezequiel Di Paolo |author3=Shaun Gallagher |title= Can social interaction constitute social cognition? |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |year=2010  |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages=441–447 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.06.009 |pmid=20674467}}
&lt;/ref&gt; De Jaegher and Di Paolo argue that the interaction process itself can take on a form of autonomy (operationally defined). This allows them to define social cognition as the generation of meaning and its transformation through interacting individuals.

The notion of participatory sense-making has led to the proposal that interaction processes can sometimes play constitutive roles in social cognition (De Jaegher, Di Paolo, Gallagher, 2010).&lt;ref name="DeJaegher1"/&gt; It has been applied to research in [[social neuroscience]]''&lt;ref name="DiPaolo3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SchilbachTimmermans&gt;
{{cite journal |author1=Leonhard Schilbach |author2=Bert Timmermans |author3=Vasudevi Reddy |author4=Alan Costall |author5=Gary Bente |author6=Tobias Schlicht |author7=Kai Vogeley |title= Toward a second-person neuroscience |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |year=2013  |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=393–414 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X12000660}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' and [[autism]].''&lt;ref name="DeJaegher_autism"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hanne De Jaegher |title= Embodiment and sense-making in autism|journal=Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience |year=2012  |volume=7 |pages=15 |doi=10.3389/fnint.2013.00015}}
&lt;/ref&gt;''

In a similar vein, "an inter-enactive approach to agency holds that the behavior of agents in a social situation unfolds not only according to their individual abilities and goals, but also according to the conditions and constraints imposed by the autonomous dynamics of the interaction process itself".&lt;ref name=STorrance&gt;
{{cite journal |title=An Inter-Enactive Approach to Agency: Participatory Sense-Making, Dynamics, and Sociality |author1=Steve Torrance |author2=Tom Froese |url=http://sacral.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pdf/froese_humana_2011.pdf |journal=Human Mente |volume=15 |pages=21–53 |year=2011 }} 
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Torrance, enactivism involves five interlocking themes related to the question "What is it to be a (cognizing, conscious) agent?" It is:&lt;ref name=STorrance/&gt;
:1. to be a biologically autonomous ([[Autopoiesis|autopoietic]]) organism
:2. to generate ''significance'' or ''meaning'', rather than to act via...updated internal representations of the external world
:3. to engage in sense-making via dynamic coupling with the environment
:4. to 'enact' or 'bring forth' a world of significances by mutual co-determination of the organism with its enacted world
:5. to arrive at an experiential awareness via lived embodiment in the world.

Torrance adds that "many kinds of agency, in particular the agency of human beings, cannot be understood separately from understanding the nature of the interaction that occurs between agents." That view introduces the social applications of enactivism. "Social cognition is regarded as the result of a special form of action, namely ''social interaction''...the enactive approach looks at the circular dynamic within a dyad of embodied agents."&lt;ref name=FuchsT&gt;

In [[cultural psychology]], enactivism is seen as a way to uncover cultural influences upon feeling, thinking and acting.&lt;ref name=Verheggen&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 8: Enactivism |author1=Cor Baerveldt |author2=Theo Verheggen |title=The Oxford Handbook of Culture and Psychology  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WljI1r2e-SUC&amp;pg=PA165 |pages=165''ff'' |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195396430.013.0009 |isbn=9780195396430 |date=May 2012 |quote= Whereas the enactive approach in general has focused on sense-making as an embodied and situated activity, enactive cultural psychology emphasizes the expressive and dynamically enacted nature of cultural meaning.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Baerveldt and Verheggen argue that "It appears that seemingly natural experience is thoroughly intertwined with sociocultural realities." They suggest that the social patterning of experience is to be understood through enactivism, "the idea that the reality we have in common, and in which we find ourselves, is neither a world that exists independently from us, nor a socially shared way of representing such a pregiven world, but a world itself brought forth by our ways of communicating and our joint action....The world we inhabit is manufactured of 'meaning' rather than 'information'.&lt;ref name=Baerveldt&gt;

==Artificial intelligence aspects==

{{main|Enactive interfaces}}
The ideas of enactivism regarding how organisms engage with their environment have interested those involved in [[Cognitive robotics|robotics]] and [[Human–computer interaction|man-machine interfaces]]. The analogy is drawn that a robot can be designed to interact and learn from its environment in a manner similar to the way an organism does that,&lt;ref name=Sandini&gt;
{{cite book |chapter=The ''iCub'' cognitive humanoid robot: An open-system research platform for enactive cognition |author1=Giulio Sandini |author2=Giorgio Metta |author3=David Vernon |title=50 Years of Artificial Intelligence: Essays Dedicated to the 50th Anniversary of Artificial Intelligence |editor1=Max Lungarella |editor2=Fumiya Iida |editor3=Josh Bongard |editor4=Rolf Pfeifer |publisher=Springer |year=2007 |isbn= 9783540772958}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and a human can interact with a computer-aided design tool or data base using an interface that creates an enactive environment for the user, that is, all the user's tactile, auditory, and visual capabilities are enlisted in a mutually explorative engagement, capitalizing upon all the user's abilities, and not at all limited to cerebral engagement.&lt;ref name=Bordegoni&gt;
{{cite book |title=Emotional Engineering: Service Development |chapter=§4.5.2 Design tools based upon enactive interfaces |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ow-UFDj15rUC&amp;pg=PA78 |pages=78 ''ff'' |isbn=9781849964234 |year=2010 |publisher=Springer |author=Monica Bordegoni |editor=Shuichi Fukuda}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In these areas it is common to refer to [[affordance]]s as a design concept, the idea that an environment or an interface affords opportunities for enaction, and good design involves optimizing the role of such affordances.&lt;ref name=Norman&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Design of Everyday Things |edition=Revised and expanded |quote=An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVQPAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17 |year=2013 |page=11 |isbn=978-0465050659 |publisher=Basic Books |author=Don Norman |chapter=Affordances }}

The activity in the AI community also has influenced enactivism as whole. Referring extensively to modeling techniques for [[evolutionary robotics]] by Beer,&lt;ref name=Beer&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; McGann, De Jaegher, and Di Paolo discuss how this work makes the dynamics of coupling between an agent and its environment, the foundation of enactivism, "an operational, empirically observable phenomenon."&lt;ref name=McGann3&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Marek McGann |author2=Hanne De Jaegher |author3=Ezequiel Di Paolo |year= 2013 |title=Enaction and psychology |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=203–209 |url= https://www.academia.edu/4993021/Enaction_and_Psychology |doi= 10.1037/a0032935 |quote=Such modeling techniques allow us to explore the parameter space of coupling between agent and environment...to the point that their basic principles (the universals, if such there are, of enactive psychology) can be brought clearly into view.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the AI environment invents examples of enactivism using concrete examples that, although not as complex as living organisms, isolate and illuminate basic principles.

Eurythermy is an aspect of thermoregulation in organisms. It is in contrast with the idea of [[stenothermic]] organisms, which can only operate within a relatively narrow range of ambient temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Hill R, Wyse G, Anderson A. Animal Physiology. 2004. Sinaur Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Through a wide variety of thermal coping mechanisms, eurythermic organisms can either provide or expel heat for themselves in order to survive in cold or hot, respectively, or otherwise prepare themselves for extreme temperatures. Certain species of eurytherm have been shown to have unique protein synthesis processes that differentiate them from relatively stenothermic, but otherwise similar, species.

== Examples ==

* Tardigrades, known for their ability to survive in nearly any [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]], are extreme examples of eurytherms. Certain species of tardigrade, including ''Mi. tardigradum'', are able to withstand and survive temperatures ranging from –273&amp;nbsp;°C (near [[absolute zero]]) to 150&amp;nbsp;°C in their [[Anhydrobiosis|anhydrobiotic]] state.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The desert pupfish, a rare bony fish that occupies places like the [[Colorado River Delta]] in [[Baja California]], small ponds in [[Sonora|Sonora, Mexico]], and drainage sites near the [[Salton Sea]] in [[California]], can function in waters ranging from 8º to 42&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The green crab is a common species of [[Littoral zone|littoral]] crab with a range that extends from [[Iceland]] and Central [[Norway]] in the north to [[South Africa]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria, Australia]] in the south, including more temperate regions like [[Maghreb|Northwest Africa]] in between.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; The green crab has been shown to survive in waters at least as cold as 8&amp;nbsp;°C, and at least as warm as 35&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Folco22"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li href="Category:Animal physiology"&gt;[[Subarctic climate|Boreal]] [[deciduous]] [[Pinophyta|conifers]] (genus ''[[Larch|Larix]]'') are the primary plants occupying the [[Taiga|boreal forests]] of [[Siberia]] and North America.

== Advantages over Stenotherms ==
It is thought that adaptations to cold temperatures (cold-eurythermy) in animals, despite the high cost of [[Adaptation|functional adaptation]], has allowed for mobility and agility. This cold eurythermy is also viewed as a near necessity for survival of the evolutionary crises, including ice ages, that occur with relative frequency over the [[Timeline of the evolutionary history of life|evolutionary timescale]]. Due to its ability to provide the excess energy and aerobic scope required for [[endotherm]]y, eurythermy is considered to be the "missing link" between [[ectotherm]]y and endothermy.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Portner|first=Hans O.|date=2004|title=Climate Variability and the Energetic Pathways of Evolution: The Origin of Endothermy in Mammals and Birds on JSTOR|jstor=10.1086/423742|journal=Physiological and Biochemical Zoology: Ecological and Evolutionary Approaches,|volume=77|pages=959–981|doi=10.1086/423742.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The green crab's success demonstrates one example of eurythermic advantage. Although [[invasive species]] are typically considered to be detrimental to the environment in which they are introduced, and even considered to be a leading cause of animal [[extinction]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clavero|first=Miguel|last2=Garcia-Berthou|first2=Emili|date=2005|title=Invasive species are a leading cause of animal extinctions|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2005.01.003|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=20|issue=3|pages=110–110|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.01.003|issn=0169-5347|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ability of an animal to thrive in various environmental conditions is a form of [[Fitness (biology)|evolutionary fitness]], and therefore is typically a characteristic of successful species. A species' relative eurythermality is one of the main factors in its ability to survive in different conditions. One example of eurythermic advantage can be seen in the failure of many of the world's [[Coral reef|coral reefs.]] Most species of coral are considered to be stenothermic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-01-15|title=Ecospace variability along a carbonate platform at the northern boundary of the Miocene reef belt (Upper Langhian, Austria)|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018212006979|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|language=en|volume=370|pages=232–246|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2012.12.015|issn=0031-0182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worldwide increase in oceanic temperatures has caused many coral reefs to begin bleaching and dying because the coral have begun to expel the [[zooxanthellae]] algae that live in their tissues and provide them with their food and color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glynn|first=P.

==Thermal Coping Mechanisms==
The ability to maintain [[homeostasis]] at varying temperatures is the most important characteristic in defining an endothermic eurytherm, whereas other, thermoconforming eurytherms like tardigrades are simply able to endure significant shifts in their internal body temperature that occur with ambient temperature changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramloy|first=UB|date=2000|title=Aspects of natural cold tolerance in ectothermic animals.|url=|journal=Human Reproduction|volume=15|pages=26–46|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eurythermic animals can be either conformers or regulators, meaning that their internal physiology can either vary with the external environment or maintain consistency regardless of the external environment, respectively.  It is important to note that endotherms do not solely rely on internal thermogenesis for all parts of homeostasis or comfort; in fact, in many ways, they are equally as reliant upon behavior to regulate body temperature as ectotherms are.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Citation|last=Harshaw|first=Christopher|title=Thermoregulation, Energetics, and Behavior.|date=2017-01-16|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307453574_Thermoregulation_Energetics_and_Behavior|last2=Blumberg|last3=Alberts|first2=Mark|first3=Jeffrey|accessdate=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reptiles are ectotherms, and therefore rely upon [[Thermotaxis|positive thermotaxis]], basking (heliothermy), burrowing, and crowding with members of their species in order to regulate their body temperature within a narrow range and even to produce fevers to fight infection.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Similarly, humans rely upon clothing, housing, air conditioning, and drinking to achieve the same goals, although humans are not considered indicative of endotherms on the whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003-02-01|title=The energetic cost of locomotion: humans and primates compared to generalized endotherms|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248402002099|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|language=en|volume=44|issue=2|pages=255–262|doi=10.1016/S0047-2484(02)00209-9|issn=0047-2484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered an invasive species, the green crab's ability to function in a wide range of water and air temperatures allows it to vary widely in its range.]]
The sustained supply of oxygen to body tissues determines the body temperature range of an organism. Eurytherms that live in environments with large temperature changes adapt to higher temperatures through a variety of methods. In green crabs, the process of initial warming results in an increase of oxygen consumption and heart rate, accompanied by a decrease in [[stroke volume]] and [[haemolymph]] oxygen [[partial pressure]]. As this warming continues, dissolved oxygen levels decrease below the threshold for full haemocyanin [[oxygen saturation]]. This heating then progressively releases [[haemocyanin]]-bound oxygen, saving energy in oxygen transport and resulting in an associated leveling off of [[metabolic rate]].&lt;ref name="Folco22"/&gt;

Key to maintaining homeostasis, individual thermoregulation is the ability to maintain internal body temperature in humans, the most recognizable eurytherm. In humans, deep-body temperature is regulated by [[Human skin|cutaneous]] [[Hemodynamics|blood flow]], which maintains this temperature despite changes in the external environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/895500922|title=Human Physiology|last=Ira|first=Stuart Fox|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=9780077836375|edition= 14th|location=New York, NY|pages=450–492|chapter=Cardiac Output, Blood Flow, and Blood Pressure|oclc=895500922}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Homo sapiens|Homo Sapiens]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' ability to survive in different ambient temperatures is a key factor in the species success, and one cited reason for why ''Homo sapiens'' eventually outcompeted Neanderthals (''[[Homo neandertalensis|Homo neanderthalensis]]).''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potts|first=Richard|date=1998|title=Environmental Hypotheses of Hominin Evolution|url=|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=107|pages=93–136|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have two major forms of [[thermogenesis]]. The first is [[shivering]], in which a [[warm-blooded]] creature produces involuntary contraction of [[skeletal muscle]] in order to produce heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opentextbc.ca/anatomyandphysiology/chapter/4-4-muscle-tissue-and-motion/|title=4.4 Muscle Tissue and Motion – Anatomy and Physiology|website=opentextbc.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, shivering also signals the body to produce [[FNDC5|irisin]], a hormone that has been shown to convert [[White adipose tissue|white fat]] to [[Brown adipose tissue|brown fat]], which is used in non-shivering thermogenesis, the second type of human thermogensis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/shivering-activates-brown-fat/|title=Shivering Activates Fat to Keep You Warm|last=Intagliata|first=Christopher|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-shivering thermogenesis occurs in the brown fat, which contains the [[uncoupling protein]] [[thermogenin]]. This protein decreases the proton gradient generated in [[oxidative phosphorylation]] during the synthesis of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], uncoupling the [[Electron transport chain|electron transport]] in the [[mitochondrion]] from the production of chemical energy (ATP). This creation of a gradient across the [[Cell membrane|mitochondrial membrane]] causes energy to be lost as heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/brown-adipose-tissue#ref1182545|title=Brown adipose tissue {{!}} anatomy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, humans have only one method of cooling themselves, biologically speaking: [[Perspiration|sweat]] [[evaporation]]. Cutaneous [[Merocrine|eccrine]] sweat glands produce sweat, which is made up of mostly water with a small amount of ions. Evaporation of this sweat helps to cool the blood beneath the skin, resulting in a cooling of deep-body temperature.

While some organisms are eurythermic due to their ability to regulate internal body temperature, like humans, others have wildly different methods of extreme temperature tolerance. Tardigrades are able to enter an anhydrobiotic state, often called a tun, in order to both prevent [[desiccation]] and endure extreme temperatures. In this state, tardigrades decrease their bodily water to about 1–3% wt./wt.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; Although this state allows certain tardigrades to endure temperatures at the extremes of –273° and 150&amp;nbsp;°C at the extremes, tardigrades in their hydrated state are able to withstand temperatures as low as  –196&amp;nbsp;°C. This displayed [[Extremophile|extremotolerance]] has led scientists to speculate that tardigrades could theoretically survive on [[Mars]], where temperatures regularly fluctuate between –123° and 25&amp;nbsp;°C, as well as even possibly the near absolute zero of [[Outer space|interplanetary space]]. The tardigrade's ability to withstand extremely cold temperatures as a tun is a form of [[cryptobiosis]] called cryobiosis.

In addition to other organisms, plants ([[Plant]]ae) can be either stenothermic or eurythermic. Plants inhabiting the [[Subarctic climate|boreal]] and [[Polar climate|polar]] climates generally tend to be cold-eurythermic, enduring temperatures as cold as –85°, and as warm as at least 20&amp;nbsp;°C, such as boreal deciduous conifers.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Box|first=Elgene O.|date=1996|title=Plant Functional Types and Climate at the Global Scale|jstor=3236274|journal=Journal of Vegetation Science|volume=7|issue=3|pages=309–320|doi=10.2307/3236274}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in direct contrast to plants that typically inhabit more [[Tropics|tropical]] or [[Montane ecosystems|montane]] regions, where plants may have purely tolerable range between only about 10° and 25&amp;nbsp;°C, such as the [[Banyan|banyan tree]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Eurythermal Protein Adaptation ==
The tolerance for extreme body temperatures in a given eurythermic organism is largely due to an increased temperature tolerance by the respective organism's homologous proteins. In particular, the proteins of a warm-adapted species may be inherently more eurythermal than a cold-adapted species, with warm-adapted species' proteins withstanding higher temperatures before beginning to [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]], therefore avoiding possible cell death.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dietz|first=T.

In contrast, carp [[Common carp|(C''yprinus carpio'']]'')'' have shown significantly higher protein synthesis rates after acclimating to higher water temperatures (25&amp;nbsp;°C) than after acclimating to lower water temperatures (10&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loughna|first=P.

A similar example is given by the Senegalese sole (''[[Solea senegalensis]]''), which, when acclimated to temperatures of 26&amp;nbsp;°C, produced a significantly higher amount of [[taurine]], [[Glutamic acid|glutamate]], [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] and [[glycine]] compared to acclimation to 12&amp;nbsp;°C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26762">'''FNA Mapping''' is an application of [[fine-needle aspiration]] (FNA) to the testis for the diagnosis of male infertility. FNA cytology has been used to examine pathological [[Biological tissue|human tissue]] from various organs for over 100 years.&lt;ref name="posner"&gt;, [[Carl Posner|Posner C.]] Die diagnostische Hodenpunktion.

Fine needle tissue aspiration biopsy of the testis.  Fertil Steril 1994;61:367-375.&lt;/ref&gt; testis FNA has not been widely used in U.S. to evaluate male infertility. Recently however, testicular FNA has gained popularity as both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool for the management of clinical male infertility for several reasons:

#The testis is an ideal organ for evaluation by FNA because of its uniform cellularity and easy accessibility.
#The trend toward minimally [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|invasive procedure]]s and cost-containment views FNA favorably compared to surgical testis biopsy.
#The realization that the specific histologic abnormality observed on testis biopsy has no definite correlation to either the etiology of infertility or to the ability to find sperm for [[Reproductive technology|assisted reproduction]].
#Assisted reproduction has undergone dramatic advances such that testis sperm are routinely used for biological pregnancies, thus fueling the development of novel FNA techniques to both locate and procure sperm.

For these reasons, there has been a resurgence of FNA as an important, minimally invasive tool for the evaluation and management of male infertility.

==Changes to Infertility Medicine==

Advances in [[assisted reproductive technology]] (ART) have revolutionized the ability to help men with even the severest forms of male infertility to become fathers. This field began in earnest in 1978 when the first successful [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) cycle was performed. This technique involves controlled ovarian stimulation followed by egg retrieval, in vitro fertilization, and [[embryo transfer]] to the uterus.  In the United States, the number of babies born to infertile couples with IVF has risen logarithmically from 260 babies in 1985 to almost 50,000 in 2003. Another significant advance in ART was the development of [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI) in 1992.&lt;ref name="palermo"&gt;Palermo G, Joris H, Devroey P et al. Pregnancies after intracytoplasmic injection of single spermatozoon into an oocyte. Lancet 1992; 340: 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Performed in conjunction with IVF, ICSI involves the injection of a single, viable sperm directly into the egg cytoplasm [[in vitro]] to facilitate fertilization in cases of low sperm numbers. ICSI has decreased the numerical sperm requirement for egg fertilization with IVF from hundreds of thousands of sperm for each egg to a single sperm. In addition, ICSI allows sperm with limited intrinsic fertilizing capacity, including “immature” sperm obtained from the reproductive tract of men with no sperm in the ejaculate to reliably fertilize eggs.  Indeed, ICSI has become so popular that U.S. clinics have routinely used it in more than 56% of their IVF cases.

The success of ICSI has also encouraged reproductive clinicians to look beyond the ejaculate and into the male reproductive tract to find sperm. Currently, sources of sperm routinely used for ICSI include sperm from the [[vas deferens]], epididymis, and testicle. As ART has evolved, so too have novel FNA techniques to help diagnose and treat severe male infertility. An example of this is use of testicular FNA “mapping” to systemically assess and localize sperm for ART in men with azoospermia (no [[sperm count]]) and with testis failure characterized by “patchy” or “focal” spermatogenesis.&lt;ref name="turek"&gt;Turek PJ, Ljung B-M, Cha I, Conaghan J.  Diagnostic findings from testis fine needle aspiration mapping in obstructed and non-obstructed azoospermic men.  J Urol 2000;163:1709-1716&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, this combination of techniques has allowed men with even the severest forms of infertility, including men who are azoospermic after chemotherapy for cancer, to become fathers.&lt;ref name="damani"&gt;Damani MN, Master V, Meng MV, Turek PJ, Oates RM. Post-chemotherapy ejaculatory azoospermia: Fatherhood with sperm from testis tissue using intracytoplasmic sperm injection. J Clin Oncology 2002; 20: 930-936.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accuracy==
From a contemporary search of the English literature, it is apparent that the diagnostic testis biopsy has been used to study the pathological basis of male infertility for 60 years.&lt;ref name="firket"&gt;Firket J and Damiean-Gillet M. Value and importance of testicular biopsies in Klinefelter's syndrome. Acta Clin Belg 1951; 6:80-1.&lt;/ref&gt; The surgically obtained testis biopsy accurately describes testis architecture, is the best technique to detect [[in situ]] neoplasia or cancer, and allows for the overall assessment of the interstitium (Leydig cell number and hypertrophy). Levin described a [[Qualitative research|qualitative method]] of assessing testis histologic patterns that is commonly used clinically to assess testis pathology in male infertility. Recognized patterns include: normal spermatogenesis, hypoplasia or hyposperm¬ato¬genesis, complete or early maturation arrest, Sertoli cell-only or [[germ cell]] aplasia, incomplete or late maturation arrest, and sclerosis.&lt;ref name="levin"&gt;Levin HS. Testicular biopsy in the study of male infertility: its current usefulness, histologic techniques, and prospects for the future. Hum Pathol 1979;10:569-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnsen proposed a more [[quantitative analysis (chemistry)|quantitative analysis]] of testis [[cellular architecture]] based on the concept that testis damage causes a successive disappearance of the most mature germ cell type.&lt;ref name="johnsen"&gt;Johnsen SG. Testicular biopsy score count--a method for registration of spermatogenesis in human testes: normal values and results in 335 hypogonadal males. Hormones 1970;1:2-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Johnsen scoring system involves a quantitative assessment of individual germ cell types that is very detailed and relatively laborious for routine clinical use.

Regardless of methodology, the analysis of testis biopsy histology lacks clinical value in cases of infertility because there is no clear correlation between histologic patterns or Johnsen score and the underlying etiology of infertility. That is to say, the clinical utility of understanding the histology pattern is low, because biopsy patterns do not correlate well with specific and correctable diseases. In addition, the interobserver variability in testis biopsy readings for infertility is significant. This was aptly demonstrated in a study by Cooperberg et al. in which the histology readings from two independent pathological reviews were prospectively compared with 113 testis biopsies undertaken for infertility.&lt;ref name="cooperberg"&gt;Cooperberg MR, Chi T, Jad A, Cha I, and PJ Turek. Variation in testis biopsy interpretation: implications for male infertility care in the era of intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Fertil Steril 2005; 84: 672-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, in 28% of cases preparation artifact or insufficient biopsy size rendered the sample suboptimal for interpretation. In addition, in 46% of cases, the two reviews disagreed, and this discordance resulted in significant changes in clinical care in 27% of cases. The most common error in pathological review was the under-appreciation of mixed histological patterns that are common and characteristic of infertile men with no sperm counts. Thus, although commonly used, the classical testis biopsy has little or no correlation with specific diseases, is associated with significant variability in interpretation, and can miss mixed patterns of spermatogenesis that may qualify infertile men for assisted reproduction.

==FNA Cytology vs Testis Biopsy==

In many countries, testicular FNA cytology is preferable to surgical testis biopsy for the evaluation of male infertility.  In addition to accurately demonstrating the presence or absence of mature sperm with tails, FNA provides tubular cells for cytologic analysis, also informative for the diagnosis of infertility. Unlike testis biopsy histology, however, FNA cytology has not been rigorously evaluated for the ability to distinguish in situ neoplasia and testis cancer.  Despite this caveat, the correlation of FNA cytology to testis biopsy histology is very high (84-97%) in comparative studies comprising almost 400 patients (Table 1).

Similar to the issue with biopsy histology, although several excellent descriptions of testis seminiferous epithelium cytology have been reported, no individual classification method has been uniformly adopted by cytologists as a standard approach.  Papic et al. quantified each [[cell type]] and calculated various cell indices and ratios and found that cytologic smears correlated well with histologic diagnoses.&lt;ref name="papic"&gt;Papic Z, Katona G, Skrabalo Z:  The cytologic identification and quantification of testicular cell subtypes.  Acta Cytol 1988;32:697-706.&lt;/ref&gt;  Verma et al. also determined differential cell counts in patients with normal spermatogenesis; however, the reported ratios differed dramatically from those of Papic.&lt;ref name="verma"&gt;Verma AK, Basu D, Jayaram G.  Testicular cytology in azoospermia.  Diag Cytopathol 1993;9:37-42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Batra et al. have also published a cytologic schema in which the spermatic index, [[Sertoli cell]] index, and sperm-Sertoli cell indices are categorized into various histologic groups.&lt;ref name="batra"&gt;Batra VV, Khadgawat R, Agarwal A, Krishnani N, Mishra SK, Mithal A, Pandey R.  Correlation of cell counts and indices in testicular FNAC with histology in male infertility.  Acta Cytol 1999;43:617-623.&lt;/ref&gt; Using this system, they reported that differences in cell counts and indices could predict histologic categories.  Among the different classification systems for testis FNA, those that attempt to correlate cytologic findings with biopsy histology hold the most promise to replace histology.

With the goal of replacing the more invasive biopsy histology with FNA cytology, a simple, working classification schema for testis FNA cytology has been proposed that is based on pattern recognition.&lt;ref name="meng"&gt;Meng MV, Cha I, Ljung B-M, Turek PJ. Testicular fine needle aspiration in infertile men:  Correlation of cytologic pattern with histology on biopsy.  Am J Surg Path 2001; 25: 71-79.&lt;/ref&gt;  The identified patterns represent histological diagnoses but are based on relative numbers of three easily identified germ cell types on cytologic assessment: [[Spermatocyte|primary spermatocytes]], spermatids, and spermatozoa.  The various germ and Sertoli cells are not precisely counted but are loosely quantified by assessing the relative number of cells present. In this way, a standard ratio of cell types for comparison to Sertoli cell density is created.  The FNA patterns for hypospermatogenesis, Sertoli cell-only, early maturation arrest, and late maturation arrest show different ratios of these three cell types relative to normal spermatogenesis and are relatively easy to categorize in this way. In a review of 87 patients with paired FNA maps and biopsy, this cytologic classification was observed to be reproducible and accurate.  Histologic categories determined by FNA patterns correlated well with open biopsy histology across all patterns in 94% of cases.&lt;ref name="meng" /&gt; FNA cytology was also able to completely describe mixed histologies in 12 of 14 cases. Thus, the determination of histology by FNA cytology pattern is accurate and suggests that the more invasive testis biopsy is unnecessary to diagnose states of infertility. Alternatively, it is possible that newer processing methods can be applied to testis FNA cytology specimens to concentrate and prepare [[seminiferous tubules]] for sectioning similar to classic histologic preparations.&lt;ref name="stock"&gt;Stock D, Misir V, Johnson S. Optimising FNA processing--a collection fluid allowing Giemsa, PAP and [[H&amp;E stain|H &amp; E]] staining, and facilitating thinprep, cytospin and direct smears and ancillary tests. Cytopathology. 2000; 11:523-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Either way, testis cytology is a viable alternative to histology in the evaluation of male infertility.

==Newer concepts: FNA "Mapping"==

It has become clear to reproductive urologists who regularly perform testis sperm retrieval in azoospermic men for IVF-ICSI that spermatogenesis varies geographically within the testis. This underscores the limitation and inadequacy of a single, localized testis biopsy or a single FNA specimen to accurately reflect the biology of the entire organ. In fact, the current clinical challenges are: (1) to determine which infertile men with azoospermia harbor sperm for IVF-ICSI and (2) to precisely locate the areas of sperm production within atrophic, nonobstructed testes. This clinical need led to the development of testis FNA “mapping” in male infertility by a team of [[University of California San Francisco]] physicians led by Dr. [[Paul J. Turek]] (Figure 1).

[[Image:extended fna mapping template.jpg|frame|Figure 1. Extended FNA mapping template for men with nonobstructive azoospermia used to define the presence or absence of testicular sperm. This example shows 12 individual FNA sites per testis.]]

In a pilot study of 16 men from 1997, testis FNA was used to “map” the organ for mature sperm.&lt;ref name="turek-cha"&gt;Turek PJ, Cha I, Ljung B-M.  Systematic fine-needle aspiration of the testis:  correlation to biopsy and results of organ “mapping” for mature sperm in azoospermic men.  Urology 1997;49:743-748.&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept for mapping testis for sperm was inspired by the work of Gottschalk-Sabag and colleagues&lt;ref name="gottshalk-sabag"&gt;Gottschalk-Sabag S, Glick T, Weiss DB.  Fine needle aspiration of the testis and correlation with testicular open biopsy.  Acta Cytol 1993;37:67-72 |&lt;/ref&gt; and modeled after the approach to prostate biology in which multiple prostate biopsies are used to detect foci of [[prostate cancer]]. Similarly, FNA was applied systematically to detect the presence or absence of sperm in varied geographical areas of the testis. In this study, azoospermic men underwent simultaneous testis biopsies and site-matched FNA, and FNA was found to be more sensitive in detecting sperm, as several men had sperm found by FNA but not on biopsy.&lt;ref name="turek-cha" /&gt;  Additionally, in one-third of patients, localized areas of sperm were detected by FNA in areas distant from biopsy sites without sperm.  These data confirmed intratesticular heterogeneity with respect to sperm distribution and suggested the potential of FNA to localize patches of active spermatogenesis in failing testes.

Testicular FNA mapping is performed using classic FNA technique.&lt;ref name="ljung"&gt;Ljung B-M.  Techniques of aspiration and smear preparation.  In Aspiration Biopsy:  Cytologic Interpretation and Histological Bases.  Second edition.  Edited by LG Koss, S Woyke, W Olszewski.  New York, Igaku-Shoin, 1992, pp 12-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[local anesthesia]] in the office, the testis and scrotal skin are fixed relative to each other with a gauze wrap. The “testicular wrap” is a convenient handle to manipulate the testis and also fixes the scrotal skin over the testis for the procedure. Aspiration sites are marked on the scrotal skin, 5&amp;nbsp;mm apart according to a template.

The number of aspiration sites varies with testis size and ranges from 4 (to confirm obstruction) to 15 per testis (for nonobstructive azoospermia). FNA is performed with a sharp-beveled, 23-gauge, one-inch needle using the established suction cutting technique.&lt;ref name="ljung" /&gt;  Precise, gentle, in-and-out movements, varying from 5&amp;nbsp;mm to 8&amp;nbsp;mm, are used to aspirate tissue fragments.  Ten to 30 needle excursions are made at each site.  Suction is released, and then the tissue fragments are expelled onto a slide, gently smeared, and immediately fixed in 95% [[Ethanol|ethyl alcohol]].  Pressure is applied to each site for hemostasis.  A routine [[Papanicolaou stain]] is performed. Smears are reviewed by experienced cytologists for (a) specimen adequacy (defined as at least 12 clusters of testis cells or at least 2000 well-dispersed testis cells) and (b) the presence or absence of mature sperm with tails. For immediate interpretation, fixed slides are stained with undiluted toluidine blue and read with brightfield microscopy after 15 seconds. Patients take an average of two [[Analgesic|pain pills]] after the procedure. Complications in over 800 patients have included one episode of hematospermia and, in another patient, post-operative pain for 7 days.

In another study, systematic testis FNA was used to determine which men were candidates for IVF-ICSI and to guide sperm retrieval procedures.&lt;ref name="turek-givens"&gt;Turek PJ, Givens C, Schriock ED, Meng MV, Pederson RA, Conaghan J. Testis sperm extraction and intracytoplasmic sperm injection guided by prior fine needle aspiration mapping in nonobstructive azoospermia.  Fertil Steril 1999;71:552-557.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sperm retrieval guided by prior FNA maps was proposed as an alternative to standard sperm retrieval, which is generally performed on the same day as IVF and is associated with a significant chance of sperm retrieval failure.  In 19 azoospermic men, sperm retrieval guided by prior FNA mapping found sufficient sperm for all eggs at IVF in 95% of cases. In addition, FNA-directed procedures enabled simple percutaneous FNA sperm retrieval in 20% of cases, and minimized the number of biopsies (mean 3.1) and the volume of testicular tissue (mean 72&amp;nbsp;mg) taken when open biopsies were required.  Testis sparing procedures are particularly important in men with atrophic or solitary testes, and sperm retrieval guided by information from prior FNA maps can conserve testis tissue. Thus, this study confirmed that FNA maps can accurately identify azoospermic patients who are candidates for sperm retrieval and ICSI.  In addition, it demonstrated that FNA maps can provide crucial information with respect to the precise location of sperm in the testis and can minimize the invasiveness of sperm retrieval.

Currently, two kinds of maps are performed in the evaluation of azoospermic infertile men. A compound map (&gt;4 sites/testis) is typically performed as a diagnostic test to find sperm in failing testes.  For this indication, men have testis atrophy, an elevated serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level, or a prior biopsy revealing abnormal or absent spermatogenesis.  A simple map (&lt; 4 sites/testis) is used to confirm the clinical expectation of sperm production in men who may be obstructed and azoospermic.  Simple FNA maps are offered to those who are planning to have reconstructive procedures (e.g., vasovasostomy) or sperm aspiration from the epididymis and who desire more complete information about spermatogenesis before proceeding with reconstruction or sperm retrieval. Regardless of the type of map, these procedures are generally diagnostic in nature. An experienced cytologist has a much better chance of finding sperm on a stained testis-tissue specimen with its higher resolution than does an andrology lab technician looking at the same tissue as part of a sperm retrieval procedure in an unstained specimen.

==The Biology of Sperm Production from FNA "Mapping"==

From a comprehensive study of 118 consecutive azoospermic, infertile men who underwent FNA mapping, much has been learned about the geography of spermatogenesis in both normal (obstructed) and abnormal (nonobstructed) testes.&lt;ref name="turek" /&gt; In men with [[Azoospermia|obstructive azoospermia]], sperm is found in all sites and in all locations on the FNA map.  However, in men with nonobstructive azoospermia, sperm is found in about 50% of cases.  In the subgroup of men with no sperm on a prior testis biopsy, FNA maps revealed sperm in 27% of cases.  This increased sensitivity in sperm detection is likely due to sampling a larger volume of the testis. There was also an intratesticular (site-to-site within the same testis) variation in sperm presence in 25% of cases and an intertesticular (side-to-side in the same individual) discordance rate of 19%.  This suggests that bilateral examinations are crucial to fully informing men with nonobstructive azoospermia about opportunities for fatherhood.,&lt;ref name="weiss"&gt;Weiss DB, Gottschalk-Sabag S, Bar-On E, Zukerman Z, Gat Y, Bartoov B.  Seminiferous tubule cytological pattern in infertile, azoospermic men in diagnosis and therapy.  Harefuah 1997;132:614-618.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="samli"&gt;Samli M, Sariyuce O, Basar M, Evrenkaya T.  Evaluation of nonobstructive azoospermia with bilateral testicular biopsy.  J Urol 1999;161:342.&lt;/ref&gt; FNA mapping has also been used to determine whether particular geographic sites are more likely to have sperm than others.&lt;ref name="turek" /&gt; In one study, individual testis maps from each side were pooled, and from this analysis all FNA sites showed sperm at about the same frequency; there was no suggestion of sperm “hot spots” in nonobstructive testes. Thus, FNA mapping is a valuable [[Diagnosis|diagnostic tool]] that not only guides the treatment of infertile men but can also provide a wealth of phenotypic information about the infertility condition.

Although the correlation of testis FNA cytology to testis biopsy histology is clear in the literature, how do the global organ findings from testis FNA mapping compare to biopsy histology? In other words, what is the chance of finding sperm on the map with each specific biopsy pattern? In a study of 87 patients, in whom a mean of 1.3 biopsies and 14 FNA sites were taken per patient, striking correlations were observed between FNA and histological results.&lt;ref name="meng-cha"&gt;Meng MV, Cha, I, Ljung B-M, Turek PJ.  Relationship between classic histological pattern and sperm findings on fine needle aspiration map in infertile men.  Hum Reprod 2000;15:1973-1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, sperm was found by FNA mapping in 52% of nonobstructive azoospermic patients.  Pure histologic patterns of Sertoli cell-only and early maturation arrest were associated with a very poor likelihood of sperm detection (4-8%).  In contrast, patients with other pure pattern histologies or mixed patterns had high rates of FNA sperm detection (77-100%).  Thus, sperm detection with FNA showed wide variation depending on testis histology.  In addition, certain histologic patterns may reflect a more global testicular dysfunction due to underlying genetic causes, and thus a poorer likelihood of sperm identification.

==Testis FNA "Mapping" in the Treatment of Severe Male Infertility==

In cases of infertility due to nonobstructive azoospermia, surgical sperm retrieval for IVF-ICSI is successful 40-60% of the time without prior knowledge of the geography of testis sperm production.&lt;ref name="tournaye"&gt;Tournaye H, Liu J, Nagy PZ, Camus M, Goossens A, Silber S, Van Steirtegham AC, Devroey P.  Correlation between testicular histology and outcome after intracytoplasmic sperm injection using testicular spermatozoa.  Hum Reprod 1996;11:127-132.&lt;/ref&gt; With the addition of diagnostic FNA mapping, the rate of successful sperm retrieval can be increased substantially. In addition, based on sperm quantity and distribution in the testes as assessed by the map, sperm retrieval can proceed from the least invasive to the most invasive methods. From a review n=159 cases of nonobstructive azoospermia, one group observed that 44% of mapped cases required sperm retrieval by needle aspiration (TESA); 33% required open, directed surgical biopsies (TESE); and 23% needed microsurgically-assisted dissection of the entire testis parenchyma (mTESE) for successful sperm retrieval. In addition, the majority (78%) of these cases required only unilateral sperm retrieval to find sufficient sperm for IVF-ICSI. Overall, sufficient sperm for all oocytes retrieved was possible in 95% of cases with prior maps, ranging from 100% in simple aspiration cases to 80% of microdissection cases. In addition, among men who underwent a second sperm retrieval procedure, sperm was successfully retrieved in 91% of attempt; and among patients who had a third sperm retrieval, sperm was retrieved in 100% of attempts.  Thus, knowledge of sperm location with FNA mapping can simplify and streamline sperm retrieval procedures in very difficult cases of nonobstructive azoospermia.

==Summary==

#Testis FNA cytology of the testis correlates well with testis biopsy histology in the evaluation of male infertility.
#Testis FNA cytology is rapid and safe and provides information not only on the presence or absence of sperm but, when applied in multiple areas like a “map,” can precisely localize sperm production.
#Testis FNA cytology can direct sperm retrieval procedures and minimize the amount of testicular tissue removed.
#With wider sampling of the testis achieved with FNA cytology, the heterogeneity of sperm production can be more accurately defined and sperm retrieval procedures improved.
#Although assessment of architecture and the [[basement membrane]] is not possible with FNA, whole organ cytologic examination of seminiferous tubule patterns with mapping provides useful phenotypic information about severe male factor infertility.

The '''Far 3 kpc Arm''' was discovered in 2008 by astronomer [[Tom Dame]] (Harvard-Smithsonian CfA), while preparing a talk on the Galaxy's [[spiral arms]] for a meeting of the 212th [[American Astronomical Society]]. It is one of [[Milky Way]]'s spiral arms and it is located in the first [[galactic quadrant]] at a distance of 3 [[parsec|kpc]] (about 10,000 [[light year|ly]]) from the [[galactic center]]. Along with the [[Near 3 kpc Arm]] whose existence is known since the mid-1950s, the counterpart inner arms establish our Galaxy's simple symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD |date=11 July 2008 |title=The Far 3kpc Arm |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Dame and collaborator [[Patrick Thaddeus]] analyzed data obtained using a 1.2-meter-diameter millimeter-wave [[telescope]] located at [[CTIO|Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory]] (CTIO) in Chile. They detected the presence of the spiral arm in a [[Carbon monoxide|CO]] survey and later confirmed their discovery using [[Hydrogen line|21-centimeter]] radio measurements of atomic hydrogen collected by colleagues in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2008/pr200813.html Milky Way's Inner Beauty Revealed], Press Release Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.1752 A New Spiral Arm of the Galaxy: The Far 3-Kpc Arm], T.

'''''Glaucous''''' (from the [[Latin]] ''glaucus'', meaning "bluish-grey or green", from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''glaukós'') is used to describe the pale grey or bluish-green appearance of the surfaces of some plants, as well as in the names of birds, such as the [[glaucous gull]] (''Larus hyperboreus''), [[glaucous-winged gull]] (''Larus glaucescens''), [[glaucous macaw]] (''Anodorhynchus glaucus''), and [[glaucous tanager]] (''Thraupis glaucocolpa'').

The term ''glaucous'' is also used [[botanical]]ly as an [[adjective]] to mean "covered with a greyish, bluish, or whitish [[epicuticular wax|waxy]] coating or bloom that is easily rubbed off" (e.g. glaucous leaves).

The first recorded use of ''glaucous'' as a color name in English was in the year 1671.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

==Examples==
The [[epicuticular wax]] coating on mature [[plum]] fruit gives them a glaucous appearance. Another familiar example is found in the common grape genus (''[[Vitis vinifera]]''). Some [[cacti]] have a glaucous coating on their stem(s). Glaucous coatings are [[hydrophobic]] so as to prevent [[wetting]] by rain. Their [[epicuticular wax|waxy]] character serves to hinder climbing of leaves, stem or fruit by insects. On fruits, '''glaucous''' coatings may function as a deterrent to climbing and feeding by small insects in favor of increased seed dispersal offered by larger animals such as mammals and birds.

The [[Camouflage#In nature|blue-grey camouflage coloring]] of some species of birds and sea and land animals causes their appearance to blend with their surroundings, making their detection by predators or prey difficult.

[[File:What is Gross National Happiness.ogv|thumb|330px|"What is Gross National Happiness", an info-graphical video.]]

[[File:Bhutan Gross National Happiness.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|Slogan about Gross National Happiness in Thimphu's School of Traditional Arts.]]

'''Gross National Happiness''' (also known by the acronym: '''GNH''') is a [[philosophy]] that guides the government of [[Bhutan]]. It includes an index which is used to measure the collective happiness and well-being of a population. Gross National Happiness is instituted as the goal of the government of Bhutan in the [[Constitution of Bhutan]], enacted on 18 July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan|url=http://www.nationalcouncil.bt/assets/uploads/files/Constitution%20%20of%20Bhutan%20English.pdf|website=National Council|publisher=Royal Government of Bhutan|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Gross National Happiness'' was coined in 1972 during an interview by a British journalist for the Financial Times at [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport|Bombay airport]] when the then [[List of rulers of Bhutan|king of Bhutan]], [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]], said "Gross National Happiness is more important than [[Gross domestic product|Gross National Product]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dorji|first1=Tashi|title=The story of a king, a poor country, and a rich idea|url=http://earthjournalism.net/stories/6468|accessdate=1 April 2017|publisher=Business Bhutan|date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://earthjournalism.net/stories/6468|title=The story of a king, a poor country, and a rich idea|last1=Dorji|first1=Tashi|date=15 June 2012|accessdate=1 April 2017|publisher=Business Bhutan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gnhc.gov.bt/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GNH-FAQs-pdf.pdf|title=FAQ on GNH|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, The UN General Assembly passed Resolution "Happiness: towards a holistic approach to development" urging member nations to follow the example of Bhutan and measure happiness and well-being and calling happiness a "fundamental human goal."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://repository.un.org/handle/11176/291712|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017150819/http://repository.un.org/handle/11176/291712|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2017-10-17|title=Happiness : towards a holistic approach to development : resolution / adopted by the General Assembly|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Bhutan's Prime Minister Jigme Thinley and the Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon of the United Nations convened the ''High Level Meeting: Well-being and Happiness: Defining a New Economic Paradigm'' to encourage the spread of Bhutan's GNH philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?page=view&amp;type=400&amp;nr=617&amp;menu=35|title=Defining a New Economic Paradigm: The Report of the High-Level Meeting on Wellbeing and Happiness|author=Bhutan|date=2012|publisher=United Nations|access-date=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the High Level meeting, the first [[World Happiness Report]] was issued.  Shortly after the High Level meeting, 20 March was declared to be International Day of Happiness by the UN in 2012 with resolution 66/28.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/66/281|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 28 June 2012 66/281. International Day of Happiness|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhutan's [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] [[Tshering Tobgay]] proclaimed a preference for focus on more concrete goals instead of promoting GNH when he took office,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/05/world/asia/index-of-happiness-bhutans-new-leader-prefers-more-concrete-goals.html|title=Index of Happiness?

== GNH Defined ==
GNH is distinguishable from [[Gross domestic product|Gross Domestic Product]] by valuing collective happiness as the goal of governance, by emphasizing harmony with nature and traditional values as expressed in the 9 domains of happiness and 4 pillars of GNH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/An%20Extensive%20Analysis%20of%20GNH%20Index.pdf|title=An Extensive Analysis of GNH Index|last1=Ura|first1=Karma|last2=Alkire|first2=Sabina|last3=Zangmo|first3=Tshoki|last4=Wangdi|first4=Karma|date=May 2012|publisher=The Centre for Bhutan Studies|location=Thimphu, Bhutan|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four pillars of GNH's are 1) [[Sustainable development|sustainable]] and [[Social development theory|equitable]] socio-economic development; 2) [[Environmental protection|environmental conservation]]; 3) preservation and promotion of culture; and 4) good governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tenth Five-Year Plan: 2008-2013|publisher=Gross National Happiness Commission - Royal Government of Bhutan, Actual Date of Publishing 25 June 2009 |location=Thimphu, Bhutan|url=http://www.gnhc.gov.bt/wp-content/uploads/2011/10thplan/TenthPlan_Vol1_Web.pdf|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nine domains of GNH are psychological well-being, health, time use, education, cultural diversity and resilience, good governance, community vitality, ecological diversity and resilience, and living standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ura|first1=Karma|date=2008|title=Understanding the Development Philosophy of Gross National Happiness|journal=Interview with Bhutan Broadcasting Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/|title=Welcome to the CBS's works on Gross National Happiness!|website=Gross National Happiness|publisher=www.grossnationalhappiness.com/|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each domain is composed of [[Survey methodology|subjective]] (survey-based) and objective indicators. The domains weigh equally but the indicators within each domain differ by weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ura|first=Karma|date=2012|title=A Short Guide to the Gross National Happiness Index|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Short-GNH-Index-edited.pdf|journal=The Centre for Bhutan Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation of GNH in Bhutan==
The Gross National Happiness Commission is charged with implementing GNH in Bhutan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gnhc.gov.bt/en/|title=Gross National Happiness Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GNH Commission is composed of the Secretaries each of the ministries of the government, the Prime Minister, and the Secretary of the GNH Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gnhc.gov.bt/en/commission-members/|title=Commission Members|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The GNH Commission's tasks include conceiving and implementing the nation's 5-year plan and promulgating policies. The GNH Index is used to measure the happiness and well-being of Bhutan's population. A GNH Policy Screening Tool&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gnhcentrebhutan.org/what-is-gnh/gnh-screening-tool/|title=GNH Screening Tool|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a GNH Project Screening Tool is used by the GNH commission to determine whether to pass policies or implement projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/gnh-policy-and-project-screening-tools/|title=GNH Tools|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The GNH Screening tools used by the Bhutanese GNH Commission for anticipating the impact of policy initiatives upon the levels of GNH in Bhutan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pennock|first1=M|last2=Ura|first2=K|year=|title=Gross national happiness as a framework for health impact assessment|url=|journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review|volume=31|issue=|pages=61–65|doi=10.1016/j.eiar.2010.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the first GNH survey was conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/site/ssfc2011/48920513.pdf|title=The Gross National Happiness Index of Bhutan.

The first GNH surveys consisted of long questionnaires that polled the citizens about living conditions and religious behavior, including questions about the times a person prayed in a day and other [[Karma]] indicators. It took several hours to complete one questionnaire. Later rounds of the GNH Index were shortened, but the survey retained the religious behavioral indicators.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Short-GNH-Index-edited.pdf||title=Short Guide to GNH Index}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bhutan GNH Index was developed by the [[Centre for Bhutan Studies]] with the help of the researchers from Oxford University researchers to help measure the progress of Bhutanese society. The Index function was based on Alkire &amp; Foster method of 2011.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ophi.org.uk/policy/national-policy/gross-national-happiness-index/|title=Bhutan’s Gross National Happiness Index|last=|first=|date=|website=Oxford Poverty and Human Development Index|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the creation of the national GNH Index, the government used the metric to measure national progress and inform policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adler|first=Alejandro|date=2009|title=Gross National Happiness in Bhutan: A Living Example of an Alternative Approach to Progress|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1003&amp;context=sire|journal=Social Impact Research Experience|volume=1|pages=1–137|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Musikanski|first=Laura|date=2014|title=Happiness in Public Policy|url=http://scholarworks.waldenu.edu/jsc/vol6/iss1/5/|journal=Walden University Journal of Social Change|volume=6|pages=55–85|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bhutan GNH Index is considered to measure societal progress similarly to other models such as the [[Gross National Well-being]] of 2005, the OECD [[Better Life Index]] of 2011, and SPI [[Social Progress Index]] of 2013. One distinguishing feature of Bhutan GNH Index from the other models is that the other models are designed for secular governments and do not include religious behavior measurement components.

The data is used to compare the happiness between different groups of [[Citizenship|citizens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ophi.org.uk/policy/national-policy/gross-national-happiness-index/|title=Bhutan’s Gross National Happiness Index|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and changes over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/category/survey-report/|title=A Compass Towards a Just and Harmoneous Society: 2015 GNH Survey Report|date=2016|publisher=Centre for Bhutan Studies &amp; GNH Research|isbn=978-99936-14-86-9|location=Thimphu, Bhutan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread of GNH Outside of Bhutan==
In [[Victoria, British Columbia]], [[Canada]], a shortened version of Bhutan's GNH survey was used by the local government, local foundations and governmental agencies under the leadership of Martha and Michael Pennock to assess the population of Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://victoriafoundation.bc.ca/past-initiatives/happiness-index-partnership/|title=The Happiness Index Partnership|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2011-10-03/measuring-happiness-victoria-british-columbia|title=Measuring Happiness in Victoria, British Columbia|last=Chatterjee|first=Rhitu|date=3 October 2011|website=pri.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[University of Oregon]], United States, a behavioral model of GNH based on the use of positive and negative words in [[social network]] status updates was developed by Adam Kramer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kramer|first1=Adam|title=An unobtrusive behavioral model of "gross national happiness"|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1753326.1753369|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|pages=287–290|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Thailand]] launched its own GNH center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thainews.prd.go.th/website_en/news/news_detail/WNPOL5910120010021|title=Thailand GNH Center|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202044010/http://thainews.prd.go.th/website_en/news/news_detail/WNPOL5910120010021|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former king of Thailand, Bhumibol Adulyadej, was a close friend of King Jigme Singye Wangchuck, and conceived the similar philosophy of [[Sufficiency economy|Sufficiency Economy]].

In the [[Philippines]], the concept of GNH has been lauded by various personalities, notably Philippine senator and UN Global Champion for Resilience [[Loren Legarda]], and former environment minister [[Gina Lopez]]. Bills have been filed in the Philippine Senate and House of Representatives in support of Gross National Happiness in the Philippines. Additionally, Executive Director of Bhutan’s GNH Center, Dr. Saamdu Chetri, has been invited by high-level officials in the Philippines for a GNH Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/242511/242511/|title=How PH can have Gross National Happiness, too|first=Cathy|last=Cañares-Yamsuan|date=|website=inquirer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2016/11/03/gross-national-happiness-for-ph-fvr-still-needed-malacanang/|title=Gross National Happiness for PH; FVR still needed – Malacañang|author=|date=|website=mb.com.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguidon.com/1112/main/2016/10/bhutan-happiness-guru-speaks-gross-national-happiness/|title=Bhutan ‘happiness guru’ speaks on ‘Gross National Happiness’|author=|date=23 October 2016|website=theguidon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other cities and governments have undertaken efforts to measure happiness and well-being (also termed "Beyond GDP"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fabriquespinoza.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/D5-2_BRAINPOoL_Final_Report-2.pdf|title=BRAINPOoL Final Report: Beyond GDP – From Measurement to Politics and Policy|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) since the High Level Meeting in 2012, but have not used versions of Bhutan's GNH index. Among these include the national governments of the [[United Kingdom]]'s Office of National Statistics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/bulletins/measuringnationalwellbeing/2015-09-23|title=Measuring National Well-being: Personal Well-being in the UK, 2014 to 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Arab Emirates]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.happy.ae/en|title=Happy UAE|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cities including [[Somerville, Massachusetts]], United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.somervillema.gov/Happiness/Somerville-Happiness-Survey-responses-2011-2013-20/w898-3dfm|title=Somerville Happiness Survey responses - 2011, 2013, 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bristol]], United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.happycity.org.uk/measurement-policy/happiness-pulse/|title=Happy City Happiness Pulse|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also a number of companies which are implementing sustainability practices in business have been inspired by GNH.&lt;ref&gt;Sander G. Tideman (2016), Gross National Happiness: Lessons for sustainability Leadership, South Asian Journal of Global Business Research, Vol. 5 Iss 2 pp. 190 – 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Gross National Happiness is also promoted in the United States by a nonprofit organization, [http://gnhusa.org/ Gross National Happiness USA].  Headquartered in Vermont, GNHUSA is a 501c(3) tax-exempt non-profit organization with a mission to increase personal happiness and the collective wellbeing by changing how the United States measure their progress and success. GNHUSA was founded after Linda Wheatley of Montpelier, Vermont, attended the 2008 Annual Gross National Happiness Research Conference in Thimphu, Bhutan. Wheatley returned to Vermont determined to introduce the little-known GNH concepts to the general public in the U.S. After establishing the nonprofit in the spring of 2009, representatives of the group attended the fifth international GNH research conference in Brazil in November 2009 and, in June 2010, hosted the first US-based conference on Gross National Happiness and other alternative indicators, at Champlain College in Burlington, Vermont. In May of 2012, GNHUSA with co-sponsors organized Measure What Matters, a conference building a collaborative of data experts in Vermont. The state of Vermont's Governor declared April 13th (President Jefferson’s birthday) “Pursuit of Happiness Day,” and became the first state to pass legislation enabling development of alternative indicators and to assist in making policy. GNHUSA collaborates with the Vermont Data Center to perform a [http://gnhusa.org/alternative-indicators/measuring-well-vermont-leads-way/ periodic study of well-being in the state], as a pilot for other states and municipalities. The organization also collaborates closely with the Happiness Alliance in collecting online GNH data, based on the domain of happiness developed by Bhutan.  In 2017, GNHUSA initiated the process of establishing chapters in all 50 states to work with local governments and institutions on well-being initiatives, beginning with Wisconsin and North Carolina. 
The organization also promotes the U.N.-designated International Happiness Day (March 20) as an opportunity to discuss the concepts of well-being with others at [http://gnhusa.org/happiness-dinners/ Happiness Dinners] across the country.

From August 25, 2012 to the present, GNHUSA has been carrying out a nationwide action research project, [http://gnhusa.org/serious-about-happiness/the-science-of-happiness-walking/ The Happiness Walk], carried out by GNHUSA board members and supporters. On the first leg, two GNHUSA board members walked 594 miles, from Vermont to Washington DC; the Walk most recently completed a leg from Santa Monica, CA to the Bay Area, with a side trip to Hawaii, and resumed March 1, 2018, walking from Petaluma CA to Seattle, Washington, on the 13th leg of the journey. Along the way, Walkers perform audio and video interviews and collect survey responses, introducing the concept of GNH and amassing data that will assist them in tailoring the GNH domains and indicators to American culture.
GNHUSA also posts and promotes a [http://gnhusa.org/charter-for-happiness/ Charter for Happiness] which, as of May 7, 2018, has 469 signatories.

==Criticism==

GNH has been described by critics as a [[propaganda]] tool used by the Bhutanese government to distract from [[Ethnic cleansing in Bhutan|ethnic cleansing]] and [[human rights in Bhutan|human rights abuses]] it has committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thapa|first1=Saurav Jung|title=Bhutan’s Hoax: of Gross National Happiness|work=Wave Magazine|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713000732/http://wavemag.com.np/issue/article3775.html|date=July 2011|archive-date=13 July 2011|url=http://wavemag.com.np/issue/article3775.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Vishal|last1=Arora|title=Bhutan’s Human Rights Record Defies ‘Happiness’ Claim|url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/bhutans-human-rights-record-defies-happiness-claim/|date=25 April 2014|work=The Diplomat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bhutanese democracy|Bhutanese democratic]] government began in 2008. Before that time the [[ethnic cleansing in Bhutan]] of non-Buddhist population of ethnic Nepalese of Hindu faith as a result of the GNH cultural preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/enigma-bhutan/|title=The Enigma of Bhutan|last=Bird|first=Kai|date=March 7, 2012|website=The Nation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2014/05/bhutan-forgotten-people-201452081049514496.html|title=Bhutan's Forgotten People|last=|first=|date=May 30, 2014|website=Aljazeera|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] [[Human Rights Watch]] documented the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/asia/bhutan|title=Bhutan|last=|first=|date=|website=Human Rights Watch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Human Rights Watch, "Over 100,000 or 1/6 of the population of Bhutan of Nepalese origin and [[Hindu]] faith were expelled from the country because they would not integrate with Bhutan’s [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] culture."&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/02/01/bhutans-ethnic-cleansing&lt;/ref&gt; The Refugee Council of Australia stated that "it is extraordinary and shocking that a nation can get away with expelling one sixth of its people and somehow keep its international reputation largely intact. The Government of Bhutan should be known not for Gross National Happiness but for Gross National [[Hypocrisy]]."&lt;ref&gt;The Australian Refugee Council https://www.refugeecouncil.org.au/media/time-to-challenge-bhutans-gross-national-hypocrisy/&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers state that Bhutan's GNH philosophy “has evolved over the last decade through the contribution of western and local scholars to a version that is more [[Democracy|democratic]] and open. Therefore, probably, the more accurate historical reference is to mention the coining of the GNH phrase as a key event, but not the Bhutan GNH philosophy, because the philosophy as understood by western scholars is different from the philosophy used by the King at the time.”&lt;ref&gt;The History of Gross National Happiness https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317151566_The_History_of_Gross_National_Happiness&lt;/ref&gt; Other viewpoints are that GNH is a process of development and learning, rather than an objective norm or absolute end point. Bhutan aspires to enhance the happiness of its people and GNH serves as a measurement tool for realizing that aspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Sander G. Tideman (2016), Gross National Happiness: Lessons for Sustainability Leadership South Asian Journal of Global Business Research, Vol. 5 Iss 2 pp. 190 – 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Other criticism focuses on the standard of living in Bhutan. In an article written in 2004 in the [[The Economist|Economist magazine]], “The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan is not in fact an idyll in a fairy tale. It is home to perhaps 900,000 people most of whom live in grinding poverty."&lt;ref&gt;The Economist Magazine http://www.economist.com/node/3445119&lt;/ref&gt;  Other criticism of GNH cites "increasing levels of [[political corruption]], the rapid spread of diseases such as [[HIV/AIDS|aids]] and [[tuberculosis]], [[Gang|gang violence]], abuses against women and ethnic minorities, shortages in food/medicine, and economic woes."&lt;ref&gt;The GSD Magazine https://www.gsdmagazine.org/the-false-promises-of-bhutans-gross-national-happiness/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://2008.bhutan-360.com/gross-national-happiness-happy-in-bhutan/|title=Gross National Happiness – Happy in Bhutan?|last=|first=|date=December 1, 2008|website=Bhutan, 2008 and Beyond|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Profile ==
{{quotebox|align = left|width=25em|&lt;center&gt;'''Mandate''':&lt;/center&gt;The Institute is mandated with the responsibility to:&lt;ref name="Mandate"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ilri.ernet.in/~iinrg/mandate.html | title=Mandate | accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To plan, conduct and promote researches on lac production technologies.
* To conduct basic and applied researches on processing natural resins (including lac), natural gums and gum resins for farmers and industries.
* To develop value added products of commercial use from natural resins, gums and gum resins, leading to pilot plant demonstration.
* To act as repository and provider of information on lac production and processing, product development, utilization of all natural resins, gums and gum resins.
* To transfer the technologies to farmers, entrepreneurs and processors}}

The Indian Institute of Natural Resins and Gums (IINRG) was originally established as ''Indian Lac Research Institute (ILRI)'' for acting as a nodal agency for the research and development of lac and other natural resins and gums on 20 September 1924. The Institute was mandated to focus its attention on crop harvesting and tapping, produce processing, development of products, training, information repository, technology dissemination and liaison with other national and international agencies.&lt;ref name="IINRG home"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ilri.ernet.in/~iinrg/ | title=IINRG home | accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IINRG owes its origin to the recommendations of Lindsay- Harlow Committee,&lt;ref name="Lindsay- Harlow Committee"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jharkhandobserver.com/research_inst_ilri.php | title=Lindsay- Harlow Committee | accessdate=July 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; appointed by the erstwhile Imperial Government of India, in 1920, to study the various aspects of [[lac]] in the country. On the suggestions of the Committee, Indian Lac Association for Research, a consortium of lac merchants in India was formed. The ''Indian Lac Research Institute'' was started by the Association on 20 September 1920. In 1931, the institute was moved under a newly constituted Indian Lac Cess Committee (ILCC).

Later, when the ''Indian Lac Cess Committee (ILCC)'' was formed&lt;ref name="Indian Lac Cess Committee"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://openlibrary.org/search?publisher_facet=Indian%20Lac%20Cess%20Committee | title=Bibliography of lac | publisher=Indian Lac Cess Committee | date=1933 | accessdate=July 5, 2014 | author=A.C Chatterjee | pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; as per the findings and recommendations of the Royal Commission on Agriculture, the institute was transferred to ILCC on 1 August 1931. ILCC was given the control of the ''London Shellac Research Bureau'', UK and ''Shellac Research Bureau and Polytechnique Institute of Brooklyn'', USA as well.

The status remained in the post-independence India till 1966 when the [[Indian Council of Agricultural Research]] took over the reins of the Institute on 1 April 1966, becoming one of the earlier institutes under ICAR umbrella. On 20 September 2007, the institute was renamed as the Indian Institute of Natural Resins and Gums (IINRG) and was given an expanded mandate to cover all the natural resins and gums of Indian origin.

==Divisions==
[[File:Resin with insect (aka).jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Insect]] trapped in resin]]
The activities of the Institute is primarily handled by three divisions, each entrusted with specific tasks.&lt;ref name="IINRG Division"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ilri.ernet.in/~iinrg/division.html | title=IINRG Division | accessdate=July 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lac Production Division===

LPD is involved in the research on improvement of production technologies of lac for which it focusses on the improvement of host plants and insects. It maintains a ''Lac Host and Lac Gene Bank'' and a biotechnology laboratory specifically for this purpose. Lac insect genetic stocks and host plant [[germplasm]]s are characterized so that the ideal insect/host plant combination may be selected for developing effective production technologies.

===Process and Product Development Division===

[[File:Résine.jpg|thumb|200px|Resin of a pine]]
PPD Division is a later entrant into IINRG and is engaged in the research of processing and value addition processes of natural resins and gums. It attends to the various stages of value addition at the raw, semi-finished and finished natural resins and gums and is an accredited laboratory for the collection, analysis, testing and reporting of lac and lac based products. The Division is ISO-9001 certified and hosts a ''Processing and Demonstrating Unit'' with pilot plants for research, refinement, training and demonstration, aimed at entrepreneurial requirements.

===Transfer of Technology Division===

The Transfer of Technology division is the knowledge bank of IINRG and is responsible for the assessment, refinement and dissemination of the research knowledge as well as imparting training to the farmers and other interested parties on the subject. It also maintains a ''Lac Museum'',&lt;ref name="Lac Museum"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Chemistry-Objects-Conservation-Museology/dp/0750646934 | title=Organic Chemistry of Museum Objects | publisher=Routledge |author1=John Mills |author2=Raymond White | year=2012 | pages=127 | isbn=9781136000010}}&lt;/ref&gt; displaying a comprehensive range of exhibits ranging from samples from different parts of the world, various technologies, uses of lac in industries such as cosmetics, wool dyeing, medicines and jewellery making.&lt;ref name="Uses"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://digi_lib.entomol.ntu.edu.tw/english/specialpub/5/17.htm | title=Chinese Journal of Entomology, Special Publication No. 5 | publisher=Taiwan Agricultural Chemicals and Toxic Substances Research Institute | work=Uses of lac insect in industries | date=1990 | accessdate=July 5, 2014 | author=Hwang J.

==National Network Project==
IINRG is the ''Lead Coordinating Centre'' among 7 centres, for the ''National network Project for Harvesting, Processing and Value Addition of Natural Resins and Gums''. The main objects of research are [[rosin]]s (Pinus roxburghii), [[guar gum]] (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba), [[karaya gum]] (Sterculia urens), [[gum Arabic]] (Acacia Senegal) and [[guggul]] (Commiphora mukul). It is also involved in the preparation of [[agroforestry]] models on resins and gums.&lt;ref name="NNP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.au-ju.org/vc.php | title=National Network project | accessdate=July 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
[[File:Pongamia pinnata.jpg|thumb|Pongam or Honge (''[[Millettia pinnata]]'') is a native of India and grows in profusion, generally planted as avenue trees by the forest department. It's renowned for its shade and is well known in traditional uses for its medicinal properties. It is also grown as a host plant for lac insects. The tree is also one of the food plants for Common Cerulean (''[[Jamides celeno]]'').]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11394">The '''International Corpus of English''' (ICE) is a set of [[text corpus|corpora]] representing varieties of English from around the world. Over twenty countries or groups of countries where English is the first language or an official second language are included.

==History==
[[Sidney Greenbaum]]'s goal to compile corpora that would compare the syntax of world English became the ICE project that was achieved by Professor Charles F. Meyer. Sidney Greenbaum anticipated for international teams of researchers to collect comparable national variations of English both written and spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/projects/ice-gb/beta/getstart2.pdf|title=The ICE Proejct|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparable variations would be British English, American English, and Indian English, that would be represented through a computer corpora.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/projects/ice-gb/beta/getstart2.pdf|title=The ICE Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corpora are used by researchers to compare the syntax of the varieties of English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Gerald|date=May 2004|title=Introduction|url=https://doi-org.ezproxy.uta.edu/10.1111/j.0883-2919.2004.00347.x|journal=World Englishes|language=en|volume=23|issue=2|pages=225–226|doi=10.1111/j.0883-2919.2004.00347.x|issn=0883-2919}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICE corpora completion would have comprehensive linguistic analysis of varieties of English that have emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/projects/ice-gb/beta/getstart2.pdf|title=The ICE Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ongoing research for ICE is implemented by international teams in diversified regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/projects/ice-gb/beta/getstart2.pdf|title=The ICE Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project began in 1990 with the primary aim of collecting material for comparative studies of English worldwide. Twenty-three research teams around the world are preparing electronic corpora of their own national or regional variety of English.  Each ICE corpus consists of one million words of spoken and written English produced after 1989.&lt;ref&gt;http://ice-corpora.net/ice/&lt;/ref&gt; For most participating countries, the ICE project is stimulating the first systematic investigation of the national variety. To ensure compatibility among the component corpora, each team is following a common corpus design, as well as a common scheme for grammatical annotation.

==  Description ==
Each corpus contains one million words in 500 texts of 2000 words,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ice-corpora.net/ice/design.htm|title=Corpus Design @ ICE-corpora.net|website=ice-corpora.net|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the sampling methodology used for the [[Brown Corpus]]. Unlike Brown or the [[LOB Corpus|Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen (LOB) Corpus]] (or indeed mega-corpora such as the [[British National Corpus]]), however, the ''majority'' of texts are derived from spoken data.

With only one million words per corpus, ICE corpora are considered very small for modern standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Gerald|date=|title=The ICE project and world Englishes|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.uta.edu/doi/10.1111/weng.12276/full|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1111/weng.12276/full|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICE corpora are  contain 60% (600,000 words) of orthographically transcribed ''spoken'' English. The father of the project, Sidney Greenbaum, insisted on the primacy of the spoken word, following Randolph Quirk and Jan Svartvik's collaboration on the original London-Lund Corpus (LLC). This emphasis on word-for-word transcription marks out ICE from many other corpora, including those containing, e.g. parliamentary or legal paraphrases.

The corpora consist entirely of data from 1990 or later. The subjects from which the data was collected are all adults who were educated in English and were either born, or moved at an early age, to the country to which their data is attributed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are speech and text samples from both men and women of many age groups, but the corpus website makes it a point to note that, "The proportions, however, are not representative of the proportions in the population as a whole: women are not equally represented in professions such as politics and law, and so do not produce equal amounts of discourse in these fields."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The British Component of ICE, ICE-GB, is fully parsed with a detailed Quirk ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Quirk, Randolph, Greenbaum, Sidney, Leech, Geoffrey and Svartvik, Jan (1985). ''A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language'' London: Longman&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phrase structure rules|phrase structure]] grammar, and the analyses have been thoroughly checked and completed. This analysis includes a [[part-of-speech tagging]] and [[parsing]] of the entire corpus. The treebank can be thoroughly searched and explored with the ''ICE Corpus Utility Program'' or ''ICECUP'' software. More information is in the handbook.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Gerald, Wallis, Sean, and Aarts, Bas (2002). ''Exploring Natural Language. Working with the British Component of the International Corpus of English'' Amsterdam: John Benjamins&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure compatibility between the individual corpora in ICE, each team is following a common corpus design, as well as a common scheme for grammatical annotation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/ice/ The International Corpus of English website&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Many corpora are currently available for download on the ICE official webpage, though some require a license. Others, however, are not ready for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ice-corpora.net/ice/|title=International Corpus of English (ICE) Homepage @ ICE-corpora.net|last=|first=|date=|website=ice-corpora.net|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Textual and Grammatical Annotation ===
Researchers and Linguists follow specific guidelines when annotating data for the corpus, which can be found [http://ice-corpora.net/ice/manuals.htm here], in the International Corpus of English Manuals and Documentation. The three levels of annotation are Text Markup, Wordclass Tagging, Syntactic Parsing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ice-corpora.uzh.ch/en/annotate|title=Annotation|website=www.ice-corpora.uzh.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Textual Markup ====
Original markup and layout such as sentence and paragraph parsing is preserved, with special markers indicating it as original. Spoken data is transcribed orthographically, with indicators for hesitations, false starts, and pauses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Word Class Tagging ====
Word Classes, also called [[Part of speech|Parts of Speech]], are grammatical categories for words based upon their function in a sentence.

British texts are automatically tagged for wordclass by the ICE tagger, developed at University College London, which uses a comprehensive grammar of the English language.

All other languages are tagged automatically using the PENN Treebank and the CLAWS tagset. While the tags are not corrected manually, they are checked regularly for quality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Syntactic Parsing ====
The sentence are parsed automatically and, if necessary, are manually corrected with ICECUP, a syntax tree editor created specifically for the corpus.

Dependency parsing is also done automatically with the Dependency Parser Pro3GreS. The results are not manually verified.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Pragmatic Parsing ====
Ireland is currently the only participant country who includes pragmatic annotation in their data.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4936">'''K correction''' is a correction to an [[Astronomy|astronomical]] object's [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] (or equivalently, its [[flux]]) that allows a measurement of a quantity of light from an object at a [[redshift]] ''z'' to be converted to an equivalent measurement in the [[rest frame]] of the object. If one could measure all the light from an object at all [[wavelength]]s (a bolometric flux), a K correction would not be required. If one measures the light emitted in an [[emission line]], a K-correction is not required. The need for a K-correction arises because an astronomical measurement through a single [[filter (optics)|filter]] or a single bandpass only sees a fraction of the total [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], redshifted into the frame of the observer. So if the observer wants to compare the measurements through a red filter of objects at different redshifts, the observer will have to apply estimates of the K corrections to these measurements to make a comparison.

One claim for the origin of the term "K correction" is [[Edwin Hubble]], who supposedly arbitrarily chose &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; to represent the reduction factor in magnitude due to this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Effects of Red Shifts on the Distribution of Nebulae | authorlink=Edwin Hubble | first=Edwin | last=Hubble | date=1936 | journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]] | volume=84 | pages=517–554 | doi=10.1086/143782 | bibcode=1936ApJ....84..517H| pmc=1076828 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Kinney et al., in footnote 7 on page 48 of their article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Template ultraviolet spectra to near-infrared spectra of star-forming galaxies and their application to K-corrections | first1=Anne | last1=Kinney | date=1996 | journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]] | volume=467 | pages=38–60 | doi=10.1086/177583 | last2=Calzetti | first2=Daniela | last3=Bohlin | first3=Ralph C. | last4=McQuade | first4=Kerry | last5=Storchi-Bergmann | first5=Thaisa | last6=Schmitt | first6=Henrique R. | bibcode=1996ApJ...467...38K}}&lt;/ref&gt; note an earlier origin from [[Carl Wilhelm Wirtz]] (1918),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1002/asna.19182061302 | first=V.C. | last=Wirtz | title=Über die Bewegungen der Nebelflecke | date=1918 | journal=[[Astronomische Nachrichten]] | volume=206 | issue=13 | pages=109|bibcode = 1918AN....206..109W }}&lt;/ref&gt; who referred to the correction as a ''Konstante'' (German for "constant"), hence K-correction.

The K-correction can be defined as follows

:&lt;math&gt; M = m - 5 (\log_{10}{D_L} - 1) - K_{Corr}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

I.E. the adjustment to the standard relationship between [[Absolute magnitude|absolute]] and [[Apparent magnitude|apparent]] magnitude required to correct for the redshift effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogg|first=David|title=The K Correction|url=http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0210394}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, D&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[luminosity distance]] measured in [[parsecs]].

The exact nature of the calculation that needs to be applied in order to perform a K correction depends upon the type of filter used to make the observation and the shape of the object's spectrum. If multi-color [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] measurements are available for a given object thus defining its spectral energy distribution ([[Spectral Energy Distribution|SED]]), K corrections then can be computed by [[Curve fitting|fitting]] it against a theoretical or empirical [[Spectral Energy Distribution|SED]] template.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=astro-ph/0606170|title=K-corrections and filter transformations in the ultraviolet, optical, and near infrared|journal=[[The Astronomical Journal]]|volume=133|issue=2|pages=734|bibcode=2007AJ....133..734B|author1=Blanton|first1=Michael R.|last2=Roweis|first2=Sam|date=2007|doi=10.1086/510127}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that K corrections in many frequently used broad-band filters for low-redshift [[Galaxy|galaxies]] can be precisely approximated using two-dimensional [[polynomial]]s as functions of a [[redshift]] and one observed [[Color index|color]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1002.2360|title=Analytical approximations of K-corrections in optical and near-infrared bands|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|volume=405|pages=1409|bibcode=2010MNRAS.405.1409C|author1=Chilingarian|first1=Igor V.|last2=Melchior|first2=Anne-Laure|last3=Zolotukhin|first3=Ivan Yu.|date=2010|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16506.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is implemented in the K corrections calculator web-service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kcor.sai.msu.ru|title=K-corrections calculator}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of name==
The first MADS-box gene to be identified was ''ARG80'' from budding yeast, ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'',&lt;ref name="debjdfmf"&gt;Dubois E, Bercy J, Descamps F, Messenguy F: Characterization of two new genes essential for vegetative growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: nucleotide sequence determination and chromosome mapping. Gene 1987, 55:265-275.&lt;/ref&gt; but was at that time not recognized as a member of a large gene family. The MADS-box gene family got its name later as an acronym referring to the four founding members,&lt;ref name="gcof" /&gt; ignoring ''ARG80'':
* '''M'''CM1 from the budding yeast, ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'',
* [[agamous|'''A'''GAMOUS]] from the thale cress ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'',
* '''D'''EFICIENS from the snapdragon ''[[Antirrhinum majus]]'',&lt;ref name="pmid1968830"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sommer H, Beltrán JP, Huijser P, Pape H, Lönnig WE, Saedler H, Schwarz-Sommer Z | title = Deficiens, a homeotic gene involved in the control of flower morphogenesis in Antirrhinum majus: the protein shows homology to transcription factors | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 605–13 | date = March 1990 | pmid = 1968830 | pmc = 551713 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Serum response factor|'''S'''RF]] from the human ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.

==Diversity==
MADS-box genes were detected in nearly all eukaryotes studied.&lt;ref name="glrmstg" /&gt; While the genomes of animals and fungi generally possess only around one to five MADS-box genes, genomes of [[flowering plants]] have around 100 MADS-box genes.&lt;ref name="batg"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Becker A, Theissen G | title = The major clades of MADS-box genes and their role in the development and evolution of flowering plants | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 464–89 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14615187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gltghitchhicker"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gramzow L, Theissen G | title = A hitchhiker's guide to the MADS world of plants | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 214 | pmid = 20587009 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2010-11-6-214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two types of MADS-domain proteins are distinguished; the SRF-like or Type I MADS-domain proteins and the MEF2-like (after [[Mef2|MYOCYTE-ENHANCER-FACTOR2]]) or Type II MADS-domain proteins.&lt;ref name="glrmstg" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gramzow L, Theissen G | title = A hitchhiker's guide to the MADS world of plants | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 214 | pmid = 20587009 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2010-11-6-214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SRF-like MADS-domain proteins in animals and fungi have a second conserved domain, the SAM (SRF, ARG80, MCM1) domain.&lt;ref name="spsad"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shore P, Sharrocks AD | title = The MADS-box family of transcription factors | journal = European Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 229 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–13 | date = April 1995 | pmid = 7744019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MEF2-like MADS-domain proteins in animals and fungi have the [[MEF2]] domain as a second conserved domain.&lt;ref name="spsad" /&gt; In plants, the MEF2-like MADS-domain proteins are also termed MIKC-type proteins referring to their conserved domain structure, where the MADS (M) domain is followed by an Intervening (I), a Keratin-like (K) and a [[C-terminal domain]].&lt;ref name="batg" /&gt; In plants, MADS-domain protein form tetramers and this is thought to be central for their function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Theissen G, Saedler H | title = Plant biology.

A [[genetics|geneticist]] intensely investigating MADS-box genes is [[Günter Theißen]] at the [[University of Jena]]. For example, he and his coworkers could show by these genes that the [[order (biology)|order]] of [[Gnetum|Gnetales]] is related more closely to the [[Pinophyta|conifers]] than with the [[flowering plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Winter KU, Becker A, Münster T, Kim JT, Saedler H, Theissen G | title = MADS-box genes reveal that gnetophytes are more closely related to conifers than to flowering plants | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 96 | issue = 13 | pages = 7342–7 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10377416 | pmc = 22087 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function of MADS-box genes==
MADS-box genes have a variety of functions. In animals, MADS-box genes are involved in muscle development and [[cell proliferation]] and differentiation.&lt;ref name="spsad" /&gt; Functions in fungi range from pheromone response to [[arginine]] metabolism.&lt;ref name="spsad"/&gt;

In plants, MADS-box genes are involved in controlling all major aspects of development, including male and female [[gametophyte]] development, embryo and seed development, as well as root, flower and fruit development.&lt;ref name="batg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gltghitchhicker" /&gt;

Some MADS-box genes of flowering plants have homeotic functions like the [[HOX genes]] of animals.&lt;ref name="gcof" /&gt; The floral homeotic MADS-box genes (such as ''AGAMOUS'' and ''DEFICIENS'') participate in the determination of floral organ identity according to the [[ABC model of flower development]].&lt;ref name="cesmem"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coen ES, Meyerowitz EM | title = The war of the whorls: genetic interactions controlling flower development | journal = Nature | volume = 353 | issue = 6339 | pages = 31–7 | date = September 1991 | pmid = 1715520 | doi = 10.1038/353031a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another function of MADS-box genes is flowering time determination. In ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' the MADS box genes ''SOC1''&lt;ref name="pmid10852935"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Onouchi H, Igeño MI, Périlleux C, Graves K, Coupland G | title = Mutagenesis of plants overexpressing CONSTANS demonstrates novel interactions among Arabidopsis flowering-time genes | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 885–900 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10852935 | pmc = 149091 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.12.6.885 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Flowering Locus C]]''&lt;ref name="pmid10330478"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michaels SD, Amasino RM | title = FLOWERING LOCUS C encodes a novel MADS domain protein that acts as a repressor of flowering | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 949–56 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 10330478 | pmc = 144226 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.11.5.949 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''FLC'') have been shown to have an important role in the integration of molecular flowering time pathways. These genes are essential for the correct timing of ''[[flowering]]'', and help to ensure that fertilization occurs at the time of maximal reproductive potential.

In the field of [[control engineering]], a '''map-based controller''' is a controller whose outputs are based on values derived from a pre-defined [[lookup table]]. The inputs to the controller are usually values taken from one or more sensors and are used to index the output values in the lookup table. By effectively placing the [[transfer function]] as discrete entries within a lookup table, engineers free to modify smaller sections or update the whole list of entries as required.

Map-based controllers are frequently used to manage fuel delivery systems in modern [[internal combustion engine]]s.

The '''Marine Biological Laboratory''' ('''MBL''') is an international center for research and education in biological and environmental science. Founded in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]], in 1888, the MBL is a private, nonprofit institution affiliated with the [[University of Chicago]]. After being independent for most of its history, it became affiliated with the university on July 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/uc-affiliation/|title=Affiliation with University of Chicago|website=Affiliation with University of Chicago|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/mbl-uchicago-faq/|title=MBL – University of Chicago Affiliation FAQ|website=www.mbl.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also collaborates with numerous other institutions.

== Introduction ==
The MBL has approximately 250 year-round employees, about half of which are scientists and scientific support staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/mbl-facts/|title=About the MBL|website=www.mbl.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are joined each year by more than 500 visiting scientists, summer staff, and research associates from hundreds of institutions around the world, as well as a large number of faculty and students participating in MBL courses (in 2016, 550 students from  333 institutions and 58 countries).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The MBL's resident research centers are the Eugene Bell Center for Regenerative Biology and Tissue Engineering, the Ecosystems Center, and the Bay Paul Center for Comparative Molecular Biology and Evolution. Visiting scientists are affiliated with the MBL's Whitman Center. Other resources include The Marine Resources Center, an advanced facility for maintaining, culturing, and providing aquatic and marine organisms essential to biological, biomedical, and ecological research; and The National Xenopus Resource, which breeds and maintains Xenopus (frog) genetic stocks; and provides training in Xenopus husbandry, cell biology, imaging, genetics, transgenesis, and genomics.  

Research at the MBL focuses on four themes:

* fundamental biological research, often using marine organisms as novel model systems, encompassing research in regenerative biology, neuroscience, sensory physiology, and comparative evolution and genomics;
* the study of microbiomes and microbial diversity and ecology in a variety of ocean and terrestrial habitats;
* imaging and computation;
* ecosystems science and climate change, and organismal adaptation to changing environments.

The MBL offers a range of courses, workshops, conferences, and internships throughout the year. Central to its programs are more than 20 Advanced Research Training Courses, graduate-level courses in topics ranging from physiology, embryology, neurobiology, and microbiology to imaging and computation integrated with biological research. In addition, the MBL hosts courses for undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Chicago and other colleges and universities, as well as workshops and conferences—accommodating more than 2,600 participants in 2016. (MBL Facts).

Among the scientists with a significant affiliation with the MBL (scientists, course faculty and students) are 57 Nobel Prize winners (since 1929); 124 Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators, early career scientists, international researchers, and professors (since 1960); 263 Members of the National Academy of Sciences (since 1960); and 219 Members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (since 1960). 

The MBL shares a library, the MBLWHOI Library, with [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]]. The MBLWHOI Library holds print and electronic collections in the biological, biomedical, ecological, and oceanographic sciences, and houses a growing archival collection, including photograph and videos from the MBL's 120-year history. The library also conducts digitization and informatics projects.

In September 2018, Nipam Patel became director of the Marine Biological Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/blog/introducing-nipam-patel-director-marine-biological-laboratory/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, Neil Shubin, Ph.D., and Melina Hale, Ph.D., were named interim co-directors of the Marine Biological Laboratory, succeeding [[Huntington F. Willard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/blog/uchicago-faculty-members-to-serve-on-marine-biological-laboratory-interim-leadership-team/|title=UChicago Faculty Members to Serve on MBL Interim Leadership Team|author=|date=|website=www.mbl.edu|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Marine Biological Laboratory grew from the vision of several Bostonians and [[Spencer Fullerton Baird]], the United State's first Fish Commissioner (a government official concerned with the use of [[fisheries]]). Baird had set up a [[United States Fish Commission]] research station in Woods Hole in 1882, and had ambitions to expand it into a major laboratory. He invited [[Alpheus Hyatt]] to move his marine biology laboratory and school which he had founded at the [[Norwood-Hyatt House]] in [[Annisquam, Massachusetts]], to Woods Hole. Inspired by Harvard biologist [[Louis Agassiz]]'s short-lived summer school of natural history on Penikese Island, off the coast of Woods Hole, Hyatt accepted the offer. With $10,000 raised by the Woman's Education Association of Boston and the [[Boston Society of Natural History]], land was purchased, a building was erected, and the MBL was incorporated with Hyatt as the first president of the board of trustees. The Fish Commission supplied crucial support, including marine organisms and running sea water.

[[Charles Otis Whitman]], an embryologist, was retained as the first director of the MBL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/charles-otis-whitman-1842-1910|title=Charles Otis Whitman (1842-1910) {{!}} The Embryo Project Encyclopedia|website=embryo.asu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman, who believed “other things being equal, the investigator is always the best instructor,” emphasized the need to combine research and education at the new laboratory. The MBL's first summer course provided a six-week introduction to invertebrate zoology; facilities for visiting summer investigators were also offered.

The MBL Library was established in 1889, with scientist and future MBL trustee [[Cornelia Clapp]] serving as librarian. In 1899, the MBL began publishing ''[[The Biological Bulletin]]'', a scientific journal that is still edited at the MBL.

[[Gertrude Stein]], later well known as a novelist and art collector, took part in MBL's Embryology course in the summer of 1897, while her brother Leo took part in the Invertebrates course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://comm.archive.mbl.edu/publications/women_stein.html |title=Women of Science, Gertrude Stein (1874-1946) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Inside the MBL |publisher= |access-date=August 2, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date=1897 |title=Embryology Class 1897 |medium=Photograph |url=https://hpsrepository.asu.edu/handle/10776/12859 |access-date= |archive-url= |location=Woods Hole, Massachusetts |publisher=Marine Biological Laboratory Archives |quote=1897 Embryology Class, six women sitting in front row, two rows of men standing behind them, many with hats on, most looking at camera.

The MBL formally affiliated with the [[University of Chicago]] on July 1, 2013. In order to further scientific research and education, the affiliation builds on historical ties with the university, as MBL was led by University of Chicago faculty members in its first four decades.  The president of the university chairs the MBL trustee's board and with their advice appoints its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/uc-affiliation/2013/11/27/university-of-chicago-president-robert-j-zimmer-to-serve-as-chairman-of-marine-biological-laboratory-board-of-trustees-2/|title=University of Chicago President Robert J.

== Research History ==
=== Cell, developmental, and reproductive biology ===
Cell, developmental, and reproductive biology have been a central part of the MBL's programs since the 1890s. Important discoveries in these fields at the MBL reach back to 1899, when [[Jacques Loeb]] demonstrated artificial parthenogenesis in sea urchin eggs; to 1905, when [[Edwin Grant Conklin]] first identified egg cytoplasmic regions that are programmed to form certain tissues or organs; to 1916, when [[Frank Rattray Lillie]] identified circulating hormones that influence sexual differentiation (Lillie, 1944). In the MBL's first two decades, cytologists [[Edmund Beecher Wilson]], [[Nettie Stevens]] and others made connections between the chromosomes and Mendelian heredity, while Wilson's colleague at both the MBL and Columbia University, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], launched the field of experimental genetics (Pauly, 2000:158). [[Keith R. Porter]], considered by many to be a founder of modern cell biology due to his pioneering work on the fine structure of cells, including the discovery of [[microtubules]], carried out research at the MBL starting in 1937 and directed the laboratory from 1975-77 (Barlow et al., 1993: 95-115).

The MBL is also a proving ground for new technologies in [[microscopy]] and imaging. The availability of cutting-edge imaging instrumentation in the MBL's Advanced Research Courses puts faculty and students at the forefront of experimentation. MBL Distinguished Scientist [[Osamu Shimomura]], who joined the MBL in 1983, was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his discovery of [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) in the early 1960s, which led to the development of revolutionary techniques for imaging live cells and their components. Resident Distinguished Scientist Shinya Inoué's innovations in polarized light microscopy and video imaging since the 1950s have been instrumental in clarifying the cellular events of [[mitosis]], including his discovery of the [[spindle fibers]].

The MBL has long been a center for the world's experts in cell division. In the early 1980s, [[Tim Hunt]], Joan Ruderman and others at the MBL identified the first of a class of proteins that regulate the cycle of cell division ([[cyclin]]). Hunt was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2001 for this work (Hunt, 2004). In 1984, [[Ron Vale]], Michael Sheetz, and others discovered [[kinesin]], a motor protein involved in mitosis and other cellular processes, during summer MBL research. Vale, Sheetz, and James Spudich received the 2012 Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research for their discoveries related to molecular motors. In 1991 Israeli scientist [[Avram Hershko]] began coming to the MBL to study the role that the protein ubiquitin plays in cell division. In 2004, Hershko won a Nobel Prize for his work to establish the basic mechanism of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation.

A large portion of the leading developmental biologists in the United States, both historically and today, have participated in the MBL's Embryology Course as directors, lecturers or students. One draw is the Woods Hole location and the availability of marine organisms, particularly the [[sea urchin]], that are ideal for embryological analysis because they shed nearly transparent eggs which are fertilized and develop externally. In the first decades after the course was founded in 1893, its faculty pioneered research directions that remain central today, including the study of cytoplasmic localization in eggs; embryonic cell lineage (important in modern [[stem cell]] research); and [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (today called ‘evo devo'). Some distinguished embryologists who have directed the course are [[Charles Otis Whitman]] (1893–1895); [[Frank Rattray Lillie]] (1896–1903); Viktor Hamburger (1942–45); James Ebert (1962–66); [[Eric H. Davidson]] (1972–74; 1988–96); Rudolf Raff (1980–82) (see Davidson, 1993) and  Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado and Richard Behringer (2012-2016).

=== Regenerative biology and medicine ===
In 2010, the MBL established the Eugene Bell Center for Regenerative Biology and Tissue Engineering, where researchers study the ability of marine and other animals to spontaneously regenerate damaged or aging body parts. An understanding of tissue and organ regeneration in lower animals holds promise for translation to treatments for human conditions, including spinal cord injury, diabetes, organ failure, and degenerative neural diseases such as Alzheimer's.  A cornerstone of the Bell Center is a national resource for research on the frog, Xenopus, which is a major animal model used in U.S. biomedical research. The National Xenopus Resource at the MBL is funded by the National Institutes of Health (MBL Facts).

=== Neuroscience, neurobiology, and sensory physiology ===
The MBL's contributions to [[neuroscience]] and sensory physiology are significant, fostered today by more than 65 visiting investigators and resident researchers in these fields, as well as five graduate- and post-graduate level Advanced Research Training courses. The MBL has been a magnet for the discipline since L.W. Williams in 1910 discovered, and [[John Zachary Young]] in 1936 rediscovered, the [[squid giant axon]], a nerve fiber that is 20 times larger in diameter than the largest human axon. Young brought this locally abundant, ideal experimental system to the attention of his MBL colleague [[Kenneth Stewart Cole|KS Cole]], who in 1938 used it to record the resistance changes underlying the action potential, which provided evidence that ions flowing across the axonal membrane generate this electrical impulse. In 1938, [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] came to the MBL to learn about the squid giant axon from Cole. After World War II, Hodgkin and [[Andrew Huxley]], working in Plymouth, England and using the [[voltage clamp]] technique developed by Cole, laid the basis for the modern understanding of electrical activity in the nervous system by measuring quantitatively the flow of ions across the axonal membrane. Hodgkin and Huxley received the Nobel Prize in 1963 for their description of the ionic basis of nerve conduction (Barlow et al., 1993: 151-172). Following on Hodgkin and Huxley's work, in the 1960s and 1970s [[Clay Armstrong]] and other MBL researchers described a number of the properties of the [[ion channels]] that allow sodium and potassium ions to carry electric current across the cell membrane and [[Rodolfo Llinas]] described the transmission properties at the squid giant synapse (Llinas 1999). The “scientific career” of the “Woods Hole squid,” ''[[Doryteuthis pealeii|Doryteuthis (formerly Loligo) pealeii]]'', continues today, with studies on [[axonal transport]], the [[squid giant synapse]], squid genomics, and the molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease.

Other marine organisms draw neuroscientists and neurobiologists to the MBL each summer, where a history of research into sensory physiology and behavior has been established. [[Haldan Keffer Hartline]], an MBL summer investigator in the 1920s and early 1930s, uncovered several basic mechanisms of photoreceptor function through his studies on the horseshoe crab. Hartline shared the 1967 Nobel Prize with summer MBL colleague [[George Wald]], who described the molecular basis of photoreception by showing that the light-sensitive visual pigment molecules consist of a slightly modified form of vitamin A coupled to a protein.  Another long-term summer investigator, [[Stephen W. Kuffler]], is credited with “founding” the science of [[neurobiology]] in the mid-1960s at Harvard Medical School and he also initiated instruction in neurobiology at the MBL (Barlow et al., 1993:175-234; 203-234). [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] (Nobel Laureate in 1937) conducted research at the MBL from 1947 to 1986, most significantly on the biochemical nature of muscular contraction.  In the 1950s and 1960s, Frederik Bang and Jack Levin at the MBL discovered that the blood of the horseshoe crab clotted when exposed to bacterial endotoxins even in vanishingly small amounts. From this basic research, a reagent, Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL), was developed that can detect minute amounts of bacterial toxins. The [[LAL test]] has resulted in dramatic improvement in the quality of drugs and biological products for intravenous injection.

=== Ecosystems science ===
Ecosystems research became a year-round commitment at the MBL in 1962 with the founding of the Systematics-Ecology program, under the direction of Melbourne R. Carriker. In 1975, the MBL's Ecosystems Center was established, with George Woodwell as director. The original research focus was on the global [[carbon cycle]], an emphasis maintained today. The Ecosystems Center has a year-round staff of more than 40 scientists who study a variety of ecosystems and their responses to human activities and environmental changes. The center is located in Woods Hole yet has a global reach, with active research sites in the Arctic tundra; in forest, coastal and marine sites in New England, Sweden and Brazil. The Ecosystems Center is home to two of the 26 U.S. Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites: Toolik Lake, Alaska; and Plum Island, Massachusetts. Scientists in the Ecosystems Center study the effects of forest clearance and land-use change on atmospheric chemistry, watershed processes and coastal ecology, the global-scale anthropogenic enrichment of the [[nitrogen cycle]], and ecosystem responses to [[global warming]]. The interim director of the Ecosystems Center is Anne Giblin. Former directors of the Center who are still active on the scientific staff are Jerry Melillo, who studies the [[biogeochemistry]] of terrestrial ecosystems, and John Hobbie, a microbial ecologist. The Ecosystems Center is founded on a vision of collaborative, interdisciplinary science; shared lab facilities and instrumentation; and a long-term, large-scale, systems-wide view of ecosystem processes.

=== Comparative genomics, molecular evolution, and microbial ecology ===
The Josephine Bay Paul Center for Comparative Molecular Biology and Evolution was founded at the MBL in 1997 and is currently directed by David Mark Welch. By comparing diverse [[genomes]], scientists at the center are elucidating the evolutionary relationships of biological systems, and describing genes and genomes of biomedical and environmental significance. [[Microorganisms]] found in a wide range of ecosystems, including the human [[microbiome]], are studied. [[Mitchell Sogin]], the Bay Paul Center's founder, also founded two courses at the MBL: the Workshop in Molecular Evolution; and Strategies and Techniques for Analyzing Microbial Population Structures. In 2003-2004, Sogin launched the International Census of Marine Microbes, a global effort to describe the [[biodiversity]] of marine micro-organisms. Early results from this census in 2006 revealed some 10 to 100 times more types of marine microbes than expected, and the vast majority are previously unknown, low-abundance microorganisms now called the “rare biosphere.” Other Bay Paul Center projects are focused on microbes that live in extreme environments, from [[hydrothermal vents]] to highly acidic ecosystems, which may lead to a better understanding of life that could exist on other planets. Activities at the Bay Paul Center are supported by advanced DNA sequencing and other genomics equipment at the center's Keck Ecological and Evolutionary Genetics Facility.

[[File:A cosmic megamaser.jpg|thumb|300px|A megamaser acts as an astronomical [[laser]] that beams out microwave emission rather than visible light (hence the ‘m’ replacing the ‘l’).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A cosmic megamaser|url=https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1652a/|website=www.spacetelescope.org|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''megamaser''' is a type of [[astrophysical maser]], which is a naturally occurring source of [[stimulated emission|stimulated]] [[spectral line]] emission. Megamasers are distinguished from astrophysical masers by their large [[isotropic]] [[luminosity]]. Megamasers have typical luminosities of 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [[solar luminosity|solar luminosities]] ({{Solar luminosity}}), which is 100 million times brighter than masers in the [[Milky Way]], hence the prefix [[Mega-|mega]]. Likewise, the term '''kilomaser''' is used to describe masers outside the Milky Way that have luminosities of order {{Solar luminosity}}, or thousands of times stronger than the average maser in the Milky Way, '''gigamaser''' is used to describe masers billions of times stronger than the average maser in the Milky Way, and '''extragalactic maser''' encompasses all masers found outside the Milky Way. Most known extragalactic masers are megamasers, and the majority of megamasers are [[hydroxyl]] (OH) megamasers, meaning the [[spectral line]] being amplified is one due to a transition in the hydroxyl molecule. There are known megamasers for three other molecules: [[water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[formaldehyde]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO), and [[methine]] (CH).

Water megamasers were the first type of megamaser discovered. The first water megamaser was found in 1979 in [[NGC 4945]], a galaxy in the nearby [[Centaurus A/M83 Group]]. The first hydroxyl megamaser was found in 1982 in [[Arp 220]], which is the nearest [[luminous infrared galaxy|ultraluminous infrared galaxy]] to the Milky Way. All subsequent OH megamasers that have been discovered are also in luminous infrared galaxies, and there are a small number of OH kilomasers hosted in galaxies with lower infrared luminosities. Most luminous infrared galaxies have recently merged or interacted with another galaxy, and are undergoing a burst of [[star formation]]. Many of the characteristics of the emission in hydroxyl megamasers are distinct from that of hydroxyl masers within the [[Milky Way]], including the amplification of background radiation and the ratio of hydroxyl lines at different frequencies. The [[population inversion]] in hydroxyl molecules is produced by far infrared radiation that results from absorption and re-emission of light from forming stars by surrounding [[interstellar dust]]. [[Zeeman splitting]] of hydroxyl megamaser lines may be used to measure [[magnetic field]]s in the masing regions, and this application represents the first detection of Zeeman splitting in a galaxy other than the Milky Way.

Water megamasers and kilomasers are found primarily associated with [[active galactic nuclei]], while galactic and weaker extragalactic water masers are found in star forming regions. Despite different environments, the circumstances that produce extragalactic water masers do not seem to be very different from those that produce galactic water masers. Observations of water megamasers have been used to make accurate measurements of distances to galaxies in order to provide constraints on the [[Hubble constant]].

==Background==
===Masers===
{{main|maser}} 
[[File:Stimulated Emission.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Diagram showing the process of stimulated emission]]
The word maser derives from the acronym MASER, which stands for "[[microwave|'''M'''icrowave]] [[optical amplification|'''A'''mplification]] by [[Stimulated Emission|'''S'''timulated '''E'''mission]] of [[Radiation|'''R'''adiation]]". The maser is a predecessor to lasers, which operate at optical wavelengths, and is named by the replacement of "microwave" with "light". Given a system of [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s, each with different energy states, an atom or molecule may [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorb]] a [[photon]] and move to a higher [[energy level]], or the photon may [[stimulated emission|stimulate emission]] of another photon of the same energy and cause a transition to a lower energy level. Producing a maser requires [[population inversion]], which is when a system has more members in a higher energy level relative to a lower energy level. In such a situation, more photons will be produced by stimulated emission than will be absorbed. Such a system is not in [[thermal equilibrium]], and as such requires special conditions to occur. Specifically, it must have some energy source that can pump the atoms or molecules to the excited state. Once population inversion occurs, a [[photon]] with a [[photon energy]] corresponding to the energy difference between two states can then produce stimulated emission of another photon of the same energy. The atom or molecule will drop to the lower energy level, and there will be two photons of the same energy, where before there was only one. The repetition of this process is what leads to amplification, and since all of the photons are the same energy, the light produced is [[monochromatic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Griffiths|Griffiths (2005)]], pp. 350–351.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TownesNobelLecture"&gt;{{cite web

===Astrophysical masers===
{{main|astrophysical maser}}
Masers and lasers built on [[Earth]] and masers that occur in space both require population inversion in order to operate, but the conditions under which population inversion occurs are very different in the two cases. Masers in laboratories have systems with high densities, which limits the transitions that may be used for masing, and requires using a [[resonant cavity]] in order to bounce light back and forth many times. Astrophysical masers are at low densities, and naturally have very long path lengths. At low densities, being out of thermal equilibrium is more easily achieved because thermal equilibrium is maintained by collisions, meaning population inversion can occur. Long path lengths provide photons traveling through the medium many opportunities to stimulate emission, and produce amplification of a background source of radiation. These factors accumulate to "make interstellar space a natural environment for maser operation."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Elitzur1992Book|Elitzur (1992)]], pp. 56–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Astrophysical masers may be pumped either radiatively or collisionally. In radiative pumping, [[infrared]] photons with higher energies than the maser transition photons preferentially excite atoms and molecules to the upper state in the maser in order to produce population inversion. In collisional pumping, this population inversion is instead produced by collisions that excite molecules to energy levels above that of the upper maser level, and then the molecule decays to the upper maser level by emitting photons.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lo2005|Lo (2005)]], pp. 628–629.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1965, twelve years after the first [[maser]] was built in a [[laboratory]], a hydroxyl (OH) maser was discovered in the plane of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name="Weaver1965"&gt;[[#Weaver1965|Weaver et al. (1965)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Masers of other [[molecule]]s were discovered in the Milky Way in the following years, including water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[silicon monoxide]] (SiO), and [[methanol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH).&lt;ref name="Reid1981"&gt;[[#Reid1981|Reid and Moran (1981)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The typical isotropic luminosity for these galactic masers is {{Solar luminosity|10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="Moran1976FAS"&gt;[[#Moran1976|Moran (1976)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The first evidence for extragalactic masing was detection of the hydroxyl molecule in [[NGC 253]] in 1973, and was roughly ten times more luminous than galactic masers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Elitzur1992Book|Elitzur (1992)]], p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the first megamaser was discovered in the [[ultraluminous infrared galaxy]] [[Arp 220]].&lt;ref name="Baan1982"&gt;[[#Baan1982|Baan, Wood, and Haschick (1982)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The luminosity of the source, assuming it emits [[isotropic]]ally, is roughly {{Solar luminosity|10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This luminosity is roughly one hundred million times stronger than the typical maser found in the [[Milky Way]], and so the maser source in Arp 220 was called a megamaser.&lt;ref name="Baan1984"&gt;[[#Baan1984|Baan and Haschick (1984)]]&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, extragalactic [[water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) masers were already known. In 1984, water maser emission was discovered in [[NGC 4258]] and [[NGC 1068]] that was of comparable strength to the hydroxyl maser in Arp 220, and are as such considered water megamasers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Elitzur1992Book|Elitzur (1992)]], p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next decade, megamasers were also discovered for [[formaldehyde]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO) and [[methine]] (CH). Galactic formaldehyde masers are relatively rare, and more formaldehyde megamasers are known than are galactic formaldehyde masers. Methine masers, on the other hand, are quite common in the Milky Way. Both types of megamaser were found in galaxies in which hydroxyl had been detected. Methine is seen in galaxies with hydroxyl absorption, while formaldehyde is found in galaxies with hydroxyl absorption as well as those with hydroxyl megamaser emission.&lt;ref name="Baan1993"&gt;[[#Baan1993|Baan (1993)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, 109 hydroxyl megamaser sources were known, up to a [[cosmological redshift|redshift]] of &lt;math&gt;z \approx 0.27&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Chen2007"&gt;[[#Chen2007|Chen, Shan, and Gao (2007)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Over 100 [[extragalactic astronomy|extragalactic]] water masers are known,&lt;ref name="BraatzSite"&gt;{{cite web

and of these, 65 are bright enough to be considered megamasers.&lt;ref name="Lo 2005, p. 668"&gt;[[#Lo2005|Lo (2005)]], p. 668.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General requirements==
[[File:From microwaves to megamasers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Galaxies [[MCG+01-38-004]] (upper) and [[MCG+01-38-005]] (lower) - the microwave emissions from MCG+01-38-005 were used to calculate a refined value for the [[Hubble constant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From microwaves to megamasers|url=https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1735a/|website=www.spacetelescope.org|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Regardless of the masing molecule, there are a few requirements that must be met for a strong maser source to exist. One requirement is a radio continuum background source to provide the radiation amplified by the maser, as all maser transitions take place at radio wavelengths. The masing molecule must have a pumping mechanism to create the population inversion, and sufficient density and path length for significant amplification to take place. These combine to constrain when and where megamaser emission for a given molecule will take place.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baan1993|Baan (1993)]], pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; The specific conditions for each molecule known to produce megamasers are different, as exemplified by the fact that there is no known galaxy that hosts both of the two most common megamaser species, hydroxyl and water.&lt;ref name="Lo 2005, p. 668"/&gt; As such, the different molecules with known megamasers will be addressed individually.

==Hydroxyl megamasers==
[[Arp 220]] hosts the first megamaser discovered, is the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy, and has been studied in great detail at many wavelengths. For this reason, it is the prototype of hydroxyl megamaser host galaxies, and is often used as a guide for interpreting other hydroxyl megamasers and their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Elitzur1992Book|Elitzur (1992)]], pp. 308–310.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hosts and environment===
[[File:Galaxy arp 220.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Arp 220]], the prototypical hydroxyl megamaser host galaxy {{small|([[Hubble Space Telescope]])}}]]
Hydroxyl megamasers are found in the nuclear region of a class of [[galaxy|galaxies]] called [[luminous infrared galaxy|luminous infrared galaxies]] (LIRGs), with far infrared luminosities in excess of one hundred billion [[solar luminosity|solar luminosities]], or L&lt;sub&gt;FIR&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; {{Solar luminosity|10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), with L&lt;sub&gt;FIR&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; {{Solar luminosity|10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;}} are favored.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Darling2002|Darling and Giovanelli (2002)]], p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; These infrared luminosities are very large, but in many cases LIRGs are not particularly luminous in [[visible light]]. For instance, the ratio of infrared luminosity to luminosity in [[photometric system|blue light]] is roughly 80 for Arp 220, the first source in which a megamaser was observed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Elitzur1992Book|Elitzur (1992)]], p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the LIRGs show evidence of interaction with other galaxies or having recently experienced a [[galaxy merger]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Andreasian1994|Andreasian and Alloin (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the same holds true for the LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Darling2002|Darling and Giovanelli (2002)]], pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt; Megamaser hosts are rich in [[molecular cloud|molecular gas]] compared to [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]], with molecular [[hydrogen]] masses in excess of one billion [[solar mass]]es, or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; {{Solar mass|10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="Burdyuzha1990a_86"&gt;[[#Burdyuzha1990a|Burdyuzha and Vikulov (1990)]], p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Mergers help funnel molecular gas to the nuclear region of the LIRG, producing high molecular densities and stimulating high [[star formation]] rates characteristic of LIRGs. The starlight in turn heats [[interstellar dust|dust]], which re-radiates in the far infrared and produces the high L&lt;sub&gt;FIR&lt;/sub&gt; observed in hydroxyl megamaser hosts.&lt;ref name="Burdyuzha1990a_86" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Darling2002|Darling and Giovanelli (2002)]], p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mirabel1987|Mirabel and Sanders (1987)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The dust temperatures derived from far infrared fluxes are warm relative to spirals, ranging from 40–90 K.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lockett2008|Lockett and Elitzur (2008)]], p. 986.&lt;/ref&gt;

The far infrared luminosity and dust temperature of a LIRG both affect the likelihood of hosting an hydroxyl megamaser, through correlations between the dust temperature and far infrared luminosity, so it is unclear from observations alone what the role of each is in producing hydroxyl megamasers. LIRGs with warmer dust are more likely to host hydroxyl megamasers, as are ULIRGs, with L&lt;sub&gt;FIR&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; {{Solar luminosity|10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;}}. At least one out of three ULIRGs hosts an hydroxyl megamaser, as compared with roughly one out of six LIRGs.&lt;ref name="Darling2002_p117"&gt;[[#Darling2002|Darling and Giovanelli (2002)]], pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Early observations of hydroxyl megamasers indicated a correlation between the isotropic hydroxyl luminosity and far infrared luminosity, with L&lt;sub&gt;OH&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\propto&lt;/math&gt; L&lt;sub&gt;FIR&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Baan 1989"&gt;[[#Baan1989|Baan (1989)]]&lt;/ref&gt; As more hydroxyl megamasers were discovered, and care was taken to account for the [[Malmquist bias]], this observed relationship was found to be flatter, with L&lt;sub&gt;OH&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\propto&lt;/math&gt; L&lt;sub&gt;FIR&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1.2&lt;math&gt;\pm&lt;/math&gt;0.1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Darling2002_p118"&gt;[[#Darling2002|Darling and Giovanelli (2002)]], pp. 118–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early spectral classification of the nuclei of the LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers indicated that the properties of LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers cannot be distinguished from the overall population of LIRGs. Roughly one third of megamaser hosts are classified as [[starburst galaxy|starburst galaxies]], one quarter are classified as [[Seyfert galaxy|Seyfert 2 galaxies]], and the remainder are classified as [[low-ionization nuclear emission-line region]]s, or LINERs. The optical properties of hydroxyl megamaser hosts and non-hosts are not [[statistical significance|significantly]] different.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Darling2006|Darling and Giovanelli (2006)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent infrared observations using the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] are, however, able to distinguish hydroxyl megamaser hosts galaxies from non-masing LIRGs, as 10–25% of hydroxyl megamaser hosts show evidence for an [[active galactic nucleus]], compared to 50–95% for non-masing LIRGs.&lt;ref name="Willett 2011"&gt;[[#Willett2011|Willett et al. (2011)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers may be distinguished from the general population of LIRGs by their molecular gas content. The majority of molecular gas is molecular [[hydrogen]], and typical hydroxyl megamaser hosts have molecular gas [[density|densities]] greater than 1000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. These densities are among the highest mean densities of molecular gas among LIRGs. The LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers also have high fractions of dense gas relative to typical LIRGs. The dense gas fraction is measured by the ratio of the luminosity produced by [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN) relative to the luminosity of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Darling2007|Darling (2007)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Line characteristics===
[[File:Arp220 OHmegamaser.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|The 1665 and 1667 MHz maser lines in [[Arp 220]], which have been [[redshift]]ed to lower frequencies {{small|([[Arecibo Observatory]] data)}}]]
The emission of hydroxyl megamasers occurs predominantly in the so-called "main lines" at 1665 and 1667 [[megahertz|MHz]]. The hydroxyl molecule also has two "satellite lines" that emit at 1612 and 1720&amp;nbsp;MHz, but few hydroxyl megamasers have had satellite lines detected. Emission in all known hydroxyl megamasers is stronger in the 1667&amp;nbsp;MHz line; typical ratios of the flux in the 1667&amp;nbsp;MHz line to the 1665&amp;nbsp;MHz line, called the hyperfine ratio, range from a minimum of 2 to greater than 20.&lt;ref name="Randell 1995 p. 660"&gt;[[#Randell1995|Randell et al. (1995)]], p. 660.&lt;/ref&gt; For hydroxyl emitting in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], this ratio will range from 1.8 to 1, depending upon the [[optical depth]], so line ratios greater than 2 are indicative of a population out of thermal equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Baan1982_p51"&gt;[[#Baan1982|Baan, Wood, and Haschick (1982)]], p. L51.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be compared with galactic hydroxyl masers in [[star formation|star-forming]] regions, where the 1665&amp;nbsp;MHz line is typically strongest, and hydroxyl masers around [[stellar evolution|evolved stars]], in which the 1612&amp;nbsp;MHz line is often strongest, and of the main lines, 1667&amp;nbsp;MHz emission is frequently stronger than 1612&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reid1981|Reid and Moran (1981)]], pp. 247–251.&lt;/ref&gt; The total width of emission at a given [[Frequency#Physics of light|frequency]] is typically many hundreds of kilometers per second, and individual features that make up the total emission profile have widths ranging from tens to hundreds of kilometers per second.&lt;ref name="Randell 1995 p. 660"/&gt; These may also be compared with galactic hydroxyl masers, which typically have linewidths of order a kilometer per second or narrower, and are spread over a velocity of a few to tens of kilometers per second.&lt;ref name="Baan1982_p51" /&gt;

The radiation amplified by hydroxyl masers is the [[radio astronomy|radio]] continuum of its host. This continuum is primarily composed of [[synchrotron radiation]] produced by [[Type II supernova]]e.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baan2006|Baan and Klockner (2006)]], p. 559.&lt;/ref&gt; Amplification of this background is low, with amplification factors, or gains, ranging from a few percent to a few hundred percent, and sources with larger hyperfine ratios typically exhibiting larger gains. Sources with higher gains typically have narrower emission lines. This is expected if the pre-gain linewidths are all roughly the same, as line centers are amplified more than the wings, leading to line narrowing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baan1993|Baan (1993)]], p. 74–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few hydroxyl megamasers, including Arp 220, have been observed with [[very long baseline interferometry]] (VLBI), which allows sources to be studied at higher [[angular resolution]]. VLBI observations indicate that hydroxyl megamaser emission is composed of two components, one diffuse and one compact. The diffuse component displays gains of less than a factor of one and linewidths of order hundreds of kilometers per second. These characteristics are similar to those seen with single dish observations of hydroxyl megamasers that are unable to resolve individual masing components. The compact components have high gains, ranging from tens to hundreds,high ratios of flux at 1667&amp;nbsp;MHz to flux at 1665&amp;nbsp;MHz, and linewidths are of order a few kilometers per second.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lonsdale1998|Lonsdale et al. (1998)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diamond1999|Diamond et al. (1999)]]&lt;/ref&gt; These general features have been explained by a narrow circumnuclear ring of material from which the diffuse emission arises, and individual masing clouds with sizes of order one [[parsec]] that give rise to the compact emission.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parra2005|Parra et al. (2005)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The hydroxyl masers observed in the Milky Way more closely resemble the compact hydroxyl megamaser components. There are, however, some regions of extended galactic maser emission from other molecules that resemble the diffuse component of hydroxyl megamasers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parra2005|Parra et al. (2005)]], p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pumping mechanism===
The observed relationship between the luminosity of the hydroxyl line and the far infrared suggests that hydroxyl megamasers are radiatively pumped.&lt;ref name="Baan 1989"/&gt; Initial VLBI measurements of nearby hydroxyl megamasers seemed to present a problem with this model for compact emission components of hydroxyl megamasers, as they required a very high fraction of infrared photons to be absorbed by hydroxyl and lead to a maser photon being emitted, making collisional excitation a more plausible pumping mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lonsdale1998|Lonsdale et al. (1998)]], pp. L15–L16.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a model of maser emission with a clumpy masing medium appear to be able to reproduce the observed properties of compact and diffuse hydroxyl emission.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lockett2008|Lockett and Elitzur (2008)]], p. 985.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent detailed treatment finds that photons with a wavelength of 53 [[micrometre]]s are the primary pump for main line maser emission, and applies to all hydroxyl masers. In order to provide enough photons at this wavelength, the interstellar dust that reprocesses stellar radiation to infrared wavelengths must have a temperature of at least 45 [[kelvin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lockett2008|Lockett and Elitzur (2008)]], p. 991.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent observations with the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] confirm this basic picture, but there are still some discrepancies between details of the model and observations of hydroxyl megamaser host galaxies such as the required dust [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] for megamaser emission.&lt;ref name="Willett 2011"/&gt;

===Applications===
Hydroxyl megamasers occur in the nuclear regions of LIRGs, and appear to be a marker in the stage of the [[galaxy formation|formation of galaxies]]. As hydroxyl emission is not subject to [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] by [[interstellar dust]] in its host LIRG, hydroxyl masers may be useful probes of the conditions where star formation in LIRGs takes place.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Darling2005|Darling (2005)]], p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[cosmological redshift|redshifts]] of z ~ 2, there are LIRG-like galaxies more luminous than the ones in the nearby universe. The observed relationship between the hydroxyl luminosity and far infrared luminosity suggests that hydroxyl megamasers in such galaxies may be tens to hundreds of times more luminous than observed hydroxyl megamasers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Burdyuzha1990b|Burdyuzha and Komberg (1990)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Detection of hydroxyl megamasers in such galaxies would allow precise determination of the redshift, and aid understanding of star formation in these objects.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lo2005|Lo (2005)]], pp. 656–657.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first detection of the [[Zeeman effect]] in another galaxy was made through observations of hydroxyl megamasers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robishaw2008|Robishaw, Quataert, and Heiles (2008)]], p. 981.&lt;/ref&gt; The Zeeman effect is the splitting of a [[spectral line]] due to the presence of a [[magnetic field]], and the size of the splitting is linearly [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] magnetic field strength. Zeeman splitting has been detected in five hydroxyl megamasers, and the typical strength of a detected field is of order a few milligauss, similar to the field strengths measured in galactic hydroxyl masers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robishaw2008|Robishaw, Quataert, and Heiles (2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water megamasers==
Whereas hydroxyl megamasers seem to be fundamentally distinct in some ways from galactic hydroxyl masers, water megamasers do not seem to require conditions too dissimilar from galactic water masers. Water masers stronger than galactic water masers, some of which are strong enough to be classified "mega" masers, may be described by the same [[luminosity function]] as galactic water masers. Some extragalactic water masers occur in star forming regions, like galactic water masers, while stronger water masers are found in the circumnuclear regions around [[active galactic nuclei]] (AGN). The isotropic luminosities of these span a range of order one to a few hundred {{Solar luminosity}}, and are found in nearby galaxies like [[Messier 51]] ({{Solar luminosity|0.8}}) and more distant galaxies like [[NGC 4258]] ({{Solar luminosity|120}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Elitzur1992Book|Elitzur (1992)]], p. 314–316.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Line characteristics and pumping mechanism===
Water maser emission is observed primarily at 22&amp;nbsp;GHz, due to a transition between [[rotational spectroscopy|rotational energy level]]s in the water molecule. The upper state is at an energy corresponding to 643 kelvins about the ground state, and populating this upper maser level requires number densities of molecular hydrogen of order 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; or greater and temperatures of at least 300 kelvins. The water molecule comes into thermal equilibrium at molecular hydrogen number densities of roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, so this places an upper limit on the number density in a water masing region.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lo2005|Lo (2005)]], pp. 629–630.&lt;/ref&gt; Water masers emission has been successfully modelled by masers occurring behind [[shock wave]]s propagating through dense regions in the [[interstellar medium]]. These shocks produce the high number densities and temperatures (relative to typical conditions in the interstellar medium) required for maser emission, and are successful in explaining observed masers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Elitzur1999|Elitzur, Hollenbach, &amp; McKee (1989)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications===
Water megamasers may be used to provide accurate distance determinations to distant galaxies. Assuming a [[Keplerian orbit]], measuring the [[centripetal acceleration]] and [[velocity]] of water maser spots yields the physical diameter subtended by the maser spots. By then comparing the physical radius to the [[angular diameter]] measured on the sky, the distance to the maser may be determined. This method is effective with water megamasers because they occur in a small region around an AGN, and have narrow linewidths.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Herrnstein1999|Herrnstein et al. (1999)]]&lt;/ref&gt; This method of measuring distances is being used to provide an independent measure of the [[Hubble constant]] that does not rely upon use of [[standard candle]]s. The method is limited, however, by the small number of water megamasers known at distances within the [[Hubble flow]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reid2009|Reid et al. (2009)]]&lt;/ref&gt; This distance measurement also provides a measurement of the mass of the central object, which in this case is a [[supermassive black hole]]. Black hole mass measurements using water megamasers is the most accurate method of mass determination for black holes in galaxies other than the Milky Way. The black hole masses that are measured are consistent with the [[M-sigma relation]], an empirical correlation between stellar velocity dispersion in [[bulge (astronomy)|galactic bulge]]s and the mass of the central supermassive black hole.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kuo2011|Kuo et al. (2011)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Murchison Radio-Astronomy Observatory''' ('''MRO''') was founded by [[CSIRO]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory|publisher=SKA|url=http://www.ska.gov.au/Observatory/Pages/MRO.aspx|accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It lies in a designated [[radio quiet zone]] located near [[Boolardy]] station in [[Western Australia]].

It currently comprises two main instruments:  The [[Murchison Widefield Array]] (MWA), a low-frequency array operating in the frequency range 80-300&amp;nbsp;MHz; and the [[Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder]] (ASKAP).&lt;ref name=CSIRO_MRO&gt;{{cite web|title=Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory|url=http://www.atnf.csiro.au/facilities/mro.html|publisher=[[CSIRO]]|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also one of two core sites for the [[Square Kilometre Array]] (SKA), and both current instruments are technology and science pathfinders for the SKA.&lt;ref name=ANZSKA&gt;{{cite web|title=Technology and Science|url=http://www.ska.gov.au/technology/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=Australia and New Zealand SKA project|accessdate=19 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730135525/http://www.ska.gov.au/technology/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=30 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several smaller experiments (CORE, EDGES, PAPER and SCOPE) will also be sited at MRO.&lt;ref name=UWA_MRO&gt;{{cite web|title=The Murchison Radio-Astronomy Observatory (MRO)|url=http://www.astro.uwa.edu.au/ska/mro|publisher=[[University of Western Australia]]|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Operations: Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory and Geraldton support|url=http://www.icrar.org/research/mro-geraldton|publisher=International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MRO Telescopes==

===Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP)===
{{Main|Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder}}
The Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) was built by [[CSIRO]] and comprises 36 identical [[antennas]], each 12 metres in diameter, working together as a single instrument. ASKAP’s combination of fast survey speed and high sensitivity will allow astronomers to answer some fundamental questions about the creation and early evolution of our Universe, and to test theories of cosmic magnetism and predictions from [[Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;"ASKAP Science Update, Vol. 1", CSIRO, retrieved 8 November 2010 from http://www.atnf.csiro.au/projects/askap/ASKAP_Science_Update_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The facility was formally opened on 5 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/rural/content/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murchison Widefield Array (MWA)===
{{Main|Murchison Widefield Array}}
The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is a joint project between an international consortium of universities to build a low-frequency [[Radio telescope#Radio interferometry|radio array]] operating in the frequency range 80-300&amp;nbsp;MHz. The main scientific goals of the MWA are to detect [[Hydrogen line|neutral atomic Hydrogen emission]] from the cosmological [[Epoch of Reionisation|Epoch of Reionization]](EoR), to study the [[Sun]], the [[heliosphere]], the Earth's [[ionosphere]], and to study radio [[Transient astronomical event|transient phenomena]].  The MWA is the first so-called large-N array, fully cross-correlating signals from 128 phased tiles of 16 crossed dipoles (each).  The field of view is large by the standard of astronomical instruments, being on the order of 30 degrees across.

[[File:EDGES antenna.JPG|thumb|The antenna and Low Noise amplifier for the EDGES experiment, at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory in Western Australia]]
The Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signature (EDGES) is a radio telescope being developed by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] [[Haystack Observatory]] and [[Arizona State University]] (ASU) to make accurate measurements of the sky brightness temperature between 50&amp;nbsp;MHz and 200&amp;nbsp;MHz. Its scientific objective is the detection of the global (sky-average) redshifted 21-cm line from Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization corresponding to the redshift range 27 &lt;math&gt; &gt; z &gt; &lt;/math&gt; 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MIT Haystack Observatory: EDGES|url=http://www.haystack.mit.edu/ast/arrays/Edges/|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radioquiet Zone==
The MRO has been designated a protected [[radio quiet zone]] by the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] (ACMA) since April 2005, and in July 2011, an enhanced radio-quiet zone was imposed.  The initial radio-quiet zone (renamed to the ''inner zone'') was a protected zone in a 70 kilometre radius around the MRO, in which all radio apparatus licenses needed to be made with the approval of the MRO governing body.  The enhanced radio-quiet zone adds a second zone, effectively extending the license approval governing area from a radius of 70 kilometres to 150 kilometres.&lt;ref name=ACMA&gt;{{cite web|title=Planning for the radio astronomy service|url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100628|publisher=ACMA|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nankai Institute of Economics''' (Chinese: 南开大学经济研究所, abbreviated NKIE), founded in 1927 by [[何廉|He Lian]] and [[Zhang Boling]], was originally named Nankai Committee of Sociology and Economics. It changed its name into Nankai Institute of Economics in 1931, and then established the tenet of the institute, which is to "know China and serve China". The systematic social research that the institute has conducted was ahead of its time in China. The [[Nankai Price Index]], compiled in 1927, was the very first price index in China and the most important reference to the study of Chinese economy during that time, indicating that it was rather influential and of high academic value.&lt;ref name="南开经济研究所“学术中国化”研究"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=易仲芳|date=1 March 2013|title=南开经济研究所“学术中国化”研究（1927-1949年）|journal=华中师范大学}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute was then regarded as the authority of Chinese economic studies during the period of Republic of China (1912–1949).&lt;ref name="何廉回忆录"&gt;{{Cite book|title=何廉回忆录|last=何廉|publisher=中国文史出版社|editor-last=朱佑慈等译|location=北京}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nankai Institute of Economics is now affiliated to the School of Economics, and located at the Balitai campus of [[Nankai University]], [[Nankai District]], [[Tianjin]]. 

== History ==
[[File:南开大学秀山堂.jpg|thumb|[[Xiushan Hall]], donated by Li Chun, the early office of NKIE]]

=== Early stage ===
In 1926, He Lian returned to China after receiving his doctor's degree from [[Yale University]], and was offered a position by Zhang Boling, the principal of Nankai University, and [[Tao Menghe]], the head of the social research's department of [[China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture]]. Tao Menghe invited He Lian to be the research adviser for the department. Although he declined the offer, He Lian was still interested in the idea and proposed to Zhang Boling that an independent research organization should be established, which was approved by Zhang Boling.&lt;ref name="何廉回忆录" /&gt;

On September 10, 1927, Nankai Committee of Sociology and Economics was founded under the support of Zhang Boling and He Lian, and it was the previous form of Nankai Institute of Economics. Its office was set in [[Xiushan Hall]], [[Balitai]]. He Lian took the position of chief adviser of the committee. Because it was considered a specialized research institution, the committee focused its early studies on two aspects, the collection of books, journals and other materials about Chinese economy, written in Chinese and other languages, as well as the compilation of an anthology of Chinese economics which included editing and analyzing the statistics of Chinese economy. In 1928, [[Fang Xianting]], a fellow student of He Lian's, returned to China to support Nankai University after receiving his doctorate of economics from Yale. He was officially employed as the chief researcher of the committee. Influence by Fang Xianting, the committee shifted its focus to the study of "the degree and the impact of China's industrialization" in the Tianjin region, which is China's first systematic research on social economics and earliest empirical research of economics.&lt;ref name="南开大学经济研究所庆祝成立85周年2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nankai.edu.cn/nkyw/system/2012/09/10/000085694.shtml|title=南开大学经济研究所庆祝成立85周年|author1=陈鑫|date=10 September 2012|agency=南开大学新闻网}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
[[File:南开大学经济研究所第一届研究生毕业纪念.jpg|thumb|The first graduate graduation commemorative photo in 1937]]
In 1931, Nankai Committee of Sociology and Economics, together with Economic Studies under the [[School of Arts]]{{dn|date=April 2018}},&lt;!--Doesn't look like an art school--&gt;, formed the School of Economics, and the committee started to take on the role of an educational facility as well. From 1931 onwards, Nankai Institute of Economics made progress with impressive research results and its research conditions improved because of it. In the spring of 1934, the department of education of the nationalist government refused to register the School of Economics as an official institution and demanded its reorganization because the name of the school violated the regulations about "organizing university". Nankai University, therefore, had to withdraw the use of the name "School of Economics" in its official documents, and reuse the "Business School". The Economic Studies, which was previously subordinate to the School of Arts, was affiliated to the Business School. Meanwhile, because of other regulations on the establishment of institutes, the university set up "the Economic Department of Business School Institute", i.e., "Nankai Institute of Economics" (abbreviated NKIE).&lt;ref name="南开经济研究所简史"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=5 March 1997|title=南开经济研究所(中国·南开大学)简史|journal=经济研究|issue=1997(03)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Nankai did not follow up on the regulations of the government's department of education. Although it kept the accepted names in its official reports to the government, the university remained using the "School of Economics" and "Nankai Institute of Economics" in other occasions. The journal ''Nankai Index'' was created in the same year, and it received much attention from the academia in China and in other countries, because the journal was a reflection of Chinese economy at that period. In July 1935, NKIE started to accept postgraduate students, which were the first ones educated in China to receive master's degree of economics that were officially admitted by the department of education.&lt;ref name="南开经济研究所简史" /&gt; In 1935, six institutions, including NKIE, [[Peking Union Medical College]], [[Yenching University]], [[Tsinghua University]], [[University of Nanking]], and [[China's Association for Mass Education]], jointly established the "[[Association of Northern China's Countrysides Establishment]]", which was funded by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. He Lian was appointed as the chairman of the association and Fang Xianting the secretary.&lt;ref name="南开经济研究所“学术中国化”研究" /&gt; NKIE was then responsible for the training of people who could manage local governments, their financial problems and other cooperation organizations.&lt;ref name="南开经济研究所“学术中国化”研究" /&gt;

=== During the second Sino-Japanese war ===
[[File:被炸后的南开大学秀山堂残迹.jpg|thumb|The remains of NKIE's office after Xiushan Hall was bombed]]
In 1936, before the war started, Zhang Boling took precautionary measures in case that Nankai University was assaulted by the Japanese army. Before the army took over Tianjin, Nankai Institute of Economics was relocated to the underground floor of Zhongshu Library in Chongqing Nankai Secondary School, and 21,000 books and research materials, which had been collected for the last dozen years, were put into 127 boxes and shipped towards south before the university was bombed. After years of transportation through [[Hong Kong]], [[Haiphong]] and several other places, the boxes eventually arrived in Chongqing in 1940.&lt;ref name="南开经济研究所“学术中国化”研究" /&gt;[[File:Office_Building_of_Nankai.JPG|thumb|During the war, NKIE moved south and relocated in [[Chongqing Nankai Secondary School]]]]On July 29th, 1937, Nankai University was bombed by the Japanese army. The office of NKIE at Xiushan Hall was destroyed, but none of the faculty members were injured or dead. Since Nankai University and other universities coalesced and formed [[National Southwestern Associated University]], NKIE then changed its name into Economic Studies under the Business School Institute of National Southwestern Associated University. By 1939, the institute had been reestablished at the library of [[Chongqing Nankai Secondary School]], and it had also set up an agency in Kunming (where the Associated University was located).&lt;ref name="南开大学校史1989年版"&gt;{{Cite book|title=南开大学校史|last=南开大学校史编写组|date=October 1989|publisher=南开大学出版社|location=天津}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== During the Chinese civil war ===
In April 1946, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] signed the proposal to transform Nankai University from a private school into a national public university.&lt;ref name="蒋介石与张伯苓及南开大学"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=江沛|date=2011|title=蒋介石与张伯苓及南开大学|journal=民国档案|issue=01|pages=69-79}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 4th, National Southwestern Associated University held its annual graduation ceremony. It then announced the disintegration of the university on July 31st, and Nankai University moved back to Tianjin and resumed its operation. In December, NKIE returned to Tianjin, but many funds that it previously received from abroad such as [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and Institute of the Pacific Relations had stopped because of its status as a public university. The researches were therefore influenced due to the lack of financial support.&lt;ref name="南开经济研究所简史" /&gt;

In September 1947, after leaving the Kuomingtang government, He Lian and Fang Xianting established an independent "[[Chinese Economic Research Institute]]" in Shanghai on the support of [[Zhou Zuomin]] and [[Dai Zimu]], the chairman and the associate manager of [[Kincheng Banking Corporation]], in order to retain the personnel of NKIE. This institute acted as a branch of NKIE, with Fang Xianting as its director, while the members were mostly previous employees at NKIE and other graduate students of NKIE.&lt;ref name="何廉回忆录" /&gt;

=== From 1949 onwards ===
After 1949, since [[Marxian economics]] gained traction in mainland China, He Lian, Fang Xianting and other founders moved abroad one after another. Because it used to receive funds from foreign organizations like Rockefeller Foundation, Nankai Institute of Economics became a target of political oppression. It was demanded to be reformed, while many faculty members received unfair treatment.&lt;ref name="南开经济研究所“学术中国化”研究" /&gt; In 1952, after the reformation of higher education institutions, NKIE once stopped operating.&lt;ref name="南开经济研究所简史" /&gt; In 1958, Hebei's Institute of Economics of [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] was established on the basis of the old NKIE, but it was still located inside the campus of Nankai University. The independent Hebei's Institute of Economics kept its academic communication with the School of Economics of Nankai University, and many academic conferences were held among these institutions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=27 December 1959|title=南开大学经济系与中国科学院河北分院经济研究所联合举行科学讨论会|journal=经济研究|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1959, the prime minister [[Zhou Enlai]] visited Nankai University, and he was in support of the operation of NKIE. He asked, "why won't He Lian return to China? He has every right to come back." Besides this, Zhou Enlai also asked people to send his regards to He Lian and invite him to return when he met with guests from abroad.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=李家斌|date=15 April 1981|title=钱荣堃教授谈南开大学经济研究所|journal=人民教育}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, Hebei's Institute of Economics was to be shut down, and Zhou Enlai instructed Nankai University to take over it and change its name back to Nankai Institute of Economics, with the director of the School of Economics Ji Taoda as its director, and both the dean of the School of Economics [[Teng Weizao]] and the associate director [[Tao Jikan]] as its associate directors. The institute then set up four research branches, i.e. Socialist Economy, U.S. Economy, Oceania Economy and History of Modern China's Economy.&lt;ref name="南开经济研究所简史" /&gt;

During the [[Cultural Revolution]], the research at NKIE was often put into halts, and the research branches did not resume their works until 1973. In December 1979, ''Political Economics: Socialist Part'', edited by the director of NKIE [[Gu Shutang]], was officially published and became the widely-used textbook of economics among the universities in the northern China, so it was called the "northern edition". This book broke the frame of a typical Soviet Union's textbook, absorbed the newest research results and went through several revisions. It was then considered an influential volume by the educational sphere of economics in China.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=中国特色社会主义政治经济学探索的先行者——纪念谷书堂教授逝世一周年|last=逄锦聚|date=24 March 2017|agency=南开大学报}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, NKIE started to work on the major state research project "the formation of planned price"&lt;ref name="计划价格形成问题讨论会"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=福英|date=20 September 1984|title=南开大学经济研究所召开计划价格形成问题讨论会|journal=价格理论与实践}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was authorized to grant doctorates to students.

In 1987, the subdivision of Global Economy of NKIE became a separate [[Nankai Institute of International Economy]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=20 July 2014|title=南开大学国际经济研究所|journal=经济研究|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, proposed by the geographer Bao Juemin, the director of the Cultural Geography Studies of the [[Geographical Society of China]], NKIE opened a new research branch of Economic Geography, which was the first research facility of economic geography set under an institute of economics.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=楚义芳|date=1 April 1988|title=南开大学经济研究所成立经济地理室|journal=经济地理}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1994 to 1998, Chen Zongsheng took the position of the director of NKIE and focused the research on the problems of individual incomes and the transformation of economic system in developing countries. In 2002, the research branch of Urban and Regional Economy became the independent [[Institute of Urban and Regional Economy]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007|title=南开大学城市与区域经济研究所|journal=学习探索|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 10, 2012, Nankai Institute of Economics celebrated its 85 years of operation.&lt;ref name="南开大学经济研究所庆祝成立85周年2" /&gt; In October 2017, the previous director [[Chen Zongsheng]] won the eighth China's Economic Theory Innovation Award for his theory of "income distribution in China's economic transformation and development".&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.cnr.cn/native/city/20171024/t20171024_523998566.shtml|title=南开大学陈宗胜教授荣获第八届中国经济理论创新奖|last=陈庆滨|date=24 October 2017|access-date=9 December 2017|agency=央广网}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic researches ==
[[File:He_Lian.jpg|thumb|He Lian, the first director of NKIE]]

He Lian, the founder of NKIE, believes that price is the center of all economic activities according to the theory of economics,&lt;ref name="何廉回忆录" /&gt; while statistics and price index are "the barometer of economy" to observe the changing price and "examine the purchasing power of the currency", which should be "referred to when doing business".&lt;ref name="何廉回忆录" /&gt; When Nankai Committee of Sociology and Economics was first established in September 1927, they decided to start their research with the compilation of a wholesale price index in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. As the institute grew larger and the research area expanded, the index began to include quantity of import and export commodities and wholesale price in China; rate of foreign currencies in Tianjin and Shanghai; price of domestic currency, price of silver, customer price, price of essential commodities and living cost in Shanghai; wholesale price and living cost of workers in Tianjin; salary in large cities and counties; price of commodities in Chongqing during wartime, income of teachers, living costs of landlords, businessmen and workers in Chongqing; and industrial productivity in Northern China during wartime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1948|title=战时华北工业生产指数|journal=经济评论|volume=2|issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these indexes were important guides to study the economy in China during that period. For instance, the English economic historian [[R. H. Tawney|Richard H. Tawney]] wrote ''Land and Labor in China'' during his visit to China from 1929 to 1930, making use of the materials and research results of NKIE.&lt;ref name="南开大学经济研究所建所85周年纪事"&gt;{{cite news|title=知中国 服务中国——南开大学经济研究所建所85周年纪事|author1=张雁、陈建强|date=17 October 2012|agency=光明日报}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24974">'''Narrative inquiry''' or '''narrative analysis''' emerged as a discipline from within the broader field of [[qualitative research]] in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Riessman, C. K., 1993. "Narrative Analysis" (Newbury Park: Sage Publications).&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative inquiry uses field texts, such as stories, autobiography, journals, field notes, letters, conversations, [[interview]]s, family stories, photos (and other artifacts), and life experience, as the units of analysis to research and understand the way people create meaning in their lives as [[narratives]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Jean Clandinin and F. Michael Connelly, Narrative Inquiry: Experience and Story in Qualitative Research (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers, 2000), 98–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative inquiry has been employed as a tool for analysis in the fields of [[cognitive science]], [[organizational studies]], [[knowledge]] theory, [[sociology]], [[occupational science]] and [[education]] studies, among others. Other approaches include the development of [[quantitative methods]] and tools based on the large volume capture of fragmented anecdotal material, and that which is self signified or indexed at the point of capture.&lt;ref&gt;Snowden D (2010) Naturalizing Sensemaking' in Mosier and Fischer (eds) Informed by Knowledge: Expert Performance pp 223-234&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative Inquiry challenges the philosophy behind quantitative/grounded data-gathering and questions the idea of “objective” data, however, it has been criticized for not being “theoretical enough."&lt;ref&gt;David M. Boje,'' Narrative Methods for Organizational and Communication Research'' (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 2001), 83, 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clandinin and Connelly, 42. See also Laurel Richardson, “Narrative and Sociology,” in ''Representation in Ethnography'', edited by John Van Maanen (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Narrative inquiry is a form of [[qualitative research]], that emerged in the field of [[management science]] and later also developed in the field of [[knowledge management]], which shares the sphere of [[Information Management]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Harlan Cleveland]], ''The Knowledge Executive: Leadership in an Information Society'' (New York: E. P. Dutton, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus Narrative Inquiry focuses on the organization of human knowledge more than merely the collection and processing of [[data]]. It also implies that knowledge itself is considered valuable and noteworthy even when known by only one person.

[[Knowledge management]] was coined as a discipline in the early 1980s as a method of identifying, representing, sharing, and communicating [[knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Nico Stehr]] and Richard V. Ericson, eds., ''The Culture and Power of Knowledge: Inquiries into Contemporary Societies'' (New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1992); and, [[Fritz Machlup]], ''Knowledge and Knowledge Production'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Knowledge management]] and Narrative Inquiry share the idea of [[Knowledge transfer]], a theory which seeks to transfer unquantifiable elements of knowledge, including [[experience]].  Knowledge, if not communicated, becomes arguably useless, literally unused.

Philosopher [[Andy Clark]] speculates that the ways in which minds deal with [[narrative]] (second-hand information) and [[memory]] (first-hand perception) are cognitively indistinguishable.  Narrative, then, becomes an effective and powerful method of transferring knowledge.

== Narrative ways of knowing ==

[[Narrative]] is a powerful tool in the transfer, or sharing, of knowledge, one that is bound to cognitive issues of [[memory]], constructed memory, and perceived memory. [[Jerome Bruner]] discusses this issue in his 1990 book, ''Acts of Meaning'', where he considers the narrative form as a non-neutral [[rhetorical]] account that aims at “illocutionary intentions,” or the desire to [[communicate]] [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome S. Bruner]], Acts of Meaning (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1990), 85.&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique might be called “[[narrative]]” or defined as a particular branch of [[storytelling]] within the narrative method.  Bruner’s approach places the narrative in time, to “assume an experience of time” rather than just making reference to historical time.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Polkinghorne, ''Narrative Knowing and the Human Sciences'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 1988), 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

This narrative approach captures the emotion of the moment described, rendering the event active rather than passive, infused with the latent meaning being communicated by the teller.  Two concepts are thus tied to narrative storytelling: memory and notions of time, both as time as found in the past and time as re-lived in the present.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Jacques Le Goff]], ''History and Memory'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

A narrative method accepts the idea that knowledge can be held in stories that can be relayed, stored, and retrieved.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald E. Fry, ''Appreciative Inquiry and Organizational Transformation: Reports from the Field'' (Westport: CN: Quorum Books, 2002), 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
1. '''Develop''' a [[research question]]
*A qualitative study seeks to learn why or how, so the writer’s research must be directed at determining the why and how of the research topic. Therefore, when crafting a research question for a qualitative study, the writer will need to ask a why or how question about the topic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Research question]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
2. '''Select''' or produce raw data 
*The raw data tend to be [[interview]] transcriptions, but can also be the result of field notes compiled during [[participant observation]] or from other forms of data collection that can be used to produce a narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, Amanda &amp; Paul Atkinson (1996). "Making Sense of Qualitative Data." Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

3. '''Organize''' data
*According to psychology professor Donald Polkinghorne, the goal of organizing data is to refine the research question and separate irrelevant or redundant information from that which will be eventually analyzed, sometimes referred to as "narrative smoothing."&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne, Donald E. (1995). Narrative configuration in qualitative analysis. Qualitative studies in education, Vol. 8, issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some approaches to organizing data are as follows: 
:(When choosing a method of organization, one should choose the approach best suited to the research question and the goal of the project. For instance, Gee's method of organization would be best if studying the role language plays in narrative construction whereas Labov's method would more ideal for examining a certain event and its effect on an individual's experiences.)&lt;ref&gt;Riessman, C.K. (1993). "Narrative Analysis". Newbury Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith C.P. (2000). Content analysis and narrative analysis. In: Reis HT, Judd CM, eds. ''Handbook of research methods in social and personality psychology''. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*[[Labov]]'s: Thematic organization&lt;ref&gt;William Labov (1972). Some principles of linguistic methodology. Language in Society, 1, pp 97-120 doi:10.1017/S0047404500006576&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Synchronic Organization''. 
::This method is considered useful for understanding major events in the narrative and the effect those events have on the individual constructing the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Smith C.P. (2000). Content analysis and narrative analysis. In: Reis HT, Judd CM, eds. Handbook of research methods in social and personality psychology. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The approach utilizes an "evaluation model" that organizes the data into an abstract (What was this about?), an orientation (Who? What? When? Where?), a complication (Then what happened?), an evaluation (So what?), a result (What finally happened?), and a coda (the finished narrative).&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, A. &amp; Atkinson, P. (1996) Making sense of qualitative data. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Said narrative elements may not occur in a constant order; multiple or reoccurring elements may exist within a single narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, A. &amp; Atkinson, P. (1996) Making sense of qualitative data. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Polkinghorne's: Chronological Organization or ''Diachronic Organization''
::also related to the sociology of stories approach that focuses on the contexts in which narratives are constructed. This approach attends to the "embodied nature" of the person telling the narrative, the context from which the narrative is created, the relationships between the narrative teller and others within the narrative, historical continuity, and the chronological organization of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polkinghorne|first=Donald|title=Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis|journal=Qualitative Studies in Education|year=1995|volume=8|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A story with a clear beginning, middle, and end is constructed from the narrative data. Polkinghorne makes the distinction between narrative analysis and analysis of narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne, Donald E. (1995). Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis. Qualitative Studies in Education, Vol. 8, Issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative analysis utilizes "narrative reasoning" by shaping data in a narrative form and doing an in-depth analysis of each narrative on its own, whereas analysis of narratives utilizes [[paradigmatic]] reasoning and analyzes themes across data that take the form of narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne, Donald E. (1995). Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis. Qualitative Studies in Education, Vol. 8, Issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*[[Jerome Bruner|Bruner]]'s functional approach focuses on what roles narratives serve for different individuals. In this approach, narratives are viewed as the way in which individuals construct and make sense of reality as well as the ways in which meanings are created and shared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruner|first=Jerome|title=The Narrative Construction of Reality|journal=Critical Inquiry|year=1991|volume=18|issue=1|pages=1–21|doi=10.1086/448619}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is considered a functional approach to narrative analysis because the emphasis of the analysis is focused on the work that the narrative serves in helping individuals make sense of their lives, particularly through shaping random and chaotic events into a coherent narrative that makes the events easier to handle by giving them meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruner|first=Jerome|title=The Narrative Construction of Reality|journal=Critical Inquiry|year=1991|volume=18|issue=1|pages=1–21|doi=10.1086/448619}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of this form of analysis is on the interpretations of events related in the narratives by the individual telling the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruner|first=Jerome|title=The Narrative Construction of Reality|journal=Critical Inquiry|year=1991|volume=18|issue=1|pages=1–21|doi=10.1086/448619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*[[James Paul Gee|Gee]]'s approach of structural analysis focuses on the ways in which the narrative is conveyed by the speaker with particular emphasis given to the interaction between speaker and listener.&lt;ref&gt;Riessman, C.K. (1993). "Narrative Analysis." Newbury Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; In this form of analysis, the language that the speaker uses, the pauses in speech, discourse markers, and other similar structural aspects of speech are the focus. In this approach, the narrative is divided into [[stanzas]] and each stanza is analyzed by itself and also in the way in which it connects to the other pieces of the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Daiute|first=Colette &amp; Cynthia Lightfoot|title=Narrative Analysis: Studying the Development of Individuals in Society|year=2003|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*[[Jaber F. Gubrium's]] form of narrative ethnography features the storytelling process as much as the story in analyzing narrativity.  Moving from text to field, he and his associate James A. Holstein present an analytic vocabulary and procedural strategies for collecting and analyzing narrative material in everyday contexts, such as families and care settings. In their view, the structure and meaning of texts cannot be understood separate from the everyday contexts of their production.  Their two books--"Analyzing Narrative Reality" and "Varieties of Narrative Analysis" provide dimensions of an institutionally-sensitive, constructionist approach to narrative production.

*There are a multitude of ways of organizing narrative data that fall under narrative analysis; different types of research questions lend themselves to different approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Riessman, C. K. (1993). "Narrative Analysis." Newbury Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the approach, qualitative researchers organize their data into groups based on various common traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polkinghorne|first=Donald|title=Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis|journal=Qualitative Studies in Education|year=1995|volume=8|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4. '''Interpret''' data

*While interpreting qualitative data, researchers suggest looking for patterns, themes, and regularities as well as contrasts, paradoxes, and irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, A. &amp; Atkinson, P. (1996) Making sense of qualitative data. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:(The research question may have to change at this stage if the data does not offer insight to the inquiry.)
 
*The interpretation is seen in some approaches as co-created by not only the interviewer but also with help from the interviewee, as the researcher uses the interpretation given by the interviewee while also constructing their own meaning from the narrative.

(1995). Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis. Qualitative Studies in Education, Vol. 8, Issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretive research ==
The idea of imagination is where narrative inquiry and [[storytelling]] converge within narrative methodologies. Within narrative inquiry, storytelling seeks to better understand the “why” behind human action.&lt;ref&gt;Nona Lyons and Vicki Kubler LaBoskey, ''Narrative Inquiry in Practice: Advancing the Knowledge of Teaching'' (New York: Teachers College Press, 2002), 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Story collecting as a form of narrative inquiry allows the research participants to put the [[data]] into their own words and reveal the latent “why” behind their assertions.

“[[Interpretive research]]” is a form of field research methodology that also searches for the subjective "why."&lt;ref&gt;H. Klein and M. D. Myers, “A Set of Principles for Conducting and Evaluating Interpretive Field Studies” ''MIS Quarterly'' 23, no. 1 (1999): 67–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretive research, using methods such as those termed “storytelling” or “narrative inquiry,” does not attempt to predefine [[independent variables]] and [[dependent variables]], but acknowledges context and seeks to “understand phenomena through the meanings that people assign to them.”&lt;ref&gt;Heinz K. Klein and Michael D. Myers, “A Set of Principles for Conducting and Evaluating Interpretive Field Studies in Information Systems,” ''MIS Quarterly'' 23, no. 1 (March 1999): 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two influential proponents of a narrative research model are [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]. In his work on experiential, embodied metaphors, Johnson encourages the researcher to challenge “how you see knowledge as embodied, embedded in a culture based on narrative unity,” the “construct of continuity in individual lives.”&lt;ref&gt;Clandinin and Connelly, ''Narrative Inquiry'', 3. See also George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, ''Metaphors We Live By'' (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven “functions of narrative work” as outlined by Riessman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riessman|first1=Catherine|title=Narrative Methods for the Human Sciences|date=2008|publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;
1. Narrative constitutes past experiences as it provides ways for individuals to make sense of the past. 
2. Narrators argue with stories.
3. Persuading. Using rhetorical skill to position a statement to make it persuasive/to tell it how it “really” happened. To give it authenticity or ‘truth’.
4. Engagement, keeping the audience in the dynamic relationship with the narrator.

== Practices ==
Narrative analysis therefore can be used to acquire a deeper understanding of the ways in which a few individuals organize and derive meaning from events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polkinghorne|first=Donald|title=Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis|journal=Qualitative Studies in Education|year=1995|volume=8|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
. It can be particularly useful for studying the impact of social structures on an individual and how that relates to identity, intimate relationships, and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frost|first=David M.|title=Stigma and Intimacy in Same Sex Relationships: A Narrative Approach|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|year=2011|volume=25|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:

*[[Feminist]] scholars have found narrative analysis useful for data collection of perspectives that have been traditionally [[marginalized]]. The method is also appropriate to [[cross-cultural]] research.  As Michael Brecher and Frank P. Harvey advocate, when asking unusual questions it is logical to ask them in an unusual manner.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brecher and Frank P. Harvey (2002). ''Millennial Reflections on International Studies'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press), 326.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Developmental Psychology]] utilizes narrative inquiry to depict a child's experiences in areas such as self-regulation, problem-solving and development of self.&lt;ref&gt;Smith C.P. (2000). Content analysis and narrative analysis. In: Reis HT, Judd CM, eds. Handbook of research methods in social and personality psychology. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Personality uses the narrative approach in order to illustrate an individual's identity over a lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;McAdams, D.P. &amp; Zeldow, P.B. (1993). Construct validity and content analysis. Journal of Personality Assessment, 61. 243-245.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Social movements have used narrative analysis in their persuasive techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. Polkinghorne (1995). Narrative configuration in qualitative analysis. Qualitative Studies in Education, Vol. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Political practices. Stories are connected to the flow of power in the wider world. Some narratives serve different purposes for individuals and others, for groups. Some narratives overlap both individual experiences and social.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leave|first1=Patricia|title=Method Meets Art: Arts Based Research Practice|date=2009|publisher=Guliford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Promulgation of a culture: Narratives and storytelling are used to remember past events, reveal morals, entertain, relate to one another, and engage a community. Narrative inquiry helps to create an identity and demonstrate/carry on cultural values/traditions. Stories connect humans to each other and to their culture. These cultural definitions aid to make social knowledge accessible to people who are unfamiliar with the culture/situation. An example of this is how children in a given society learn from their parents and the culture around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leave|first1=Patricia|title=Method Meets Art: Arts Based Research Practice|date=2009|publisher=Guliford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yarnton Manor east.JPG|thumb|[[Yarnton Manor]], the former location of the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies]]
The '''Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies''' ('''OCHJS''') is a [[Recognised Independent Centre]] of the [[University of Oxford]], [[England]]. Its [[research fellows]] teach on a variety of undergraduate and master's degrees in [[Oriental studies]], and it publishes the ''[[Journal of Jewish Studies]]''.

==History and case statement==
The Centre was founded in 1972 by Dr David Patterson to help restore Jewish Studies in Europe in the aftermath of the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ochjs.ac.uk/home/about/our-vision/ |title=Our vision and mission statement |publisher=Ochjs.ac.uk |accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is based in the [[Clarendon Institute]], [[Walton Street]], [[Oxford]], OX1 2HG, having relocated from [[Yarnton Manor]] in 2014. It is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] and a company limited by guarantee incorporated in [[England]], under [[English law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|309720}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is the leading academic Jewish studies centre in [[Europe]].{{fact|date=May 2018}} Its Fellows and Lecturers provide courses in Hebrew and Jewish studies for undergraduates and postgraduates up to doctoral level in many faculties within the [[University of Oxford]]. The Centre also promotes Jewish studies based on the [[Bodleian Library]]’s Hebrew and Jewish collections by supporting research, by development projects, and by shared staffing with the Centre’s Leopold Muller Memorial Library.

==Leopold Muller Memorial Library==
[[File:Milenamanor6.jpg|thumb|upright|Muller Library collections]]
The Centre's library is named the '''Leopold Muller Memorial Library'''. It is housed in the basement of the Clarendon Institute.  It comprises one of the best collections of books and periodicals in Jewish Studies in Europe and serves as a resource for scholars, students and visiting fellows of the Centre. The core of the Library consists of several rare collections and archives; among those one finds a large collection of materials donated by Rabbi [[Louis Jacobs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ochjs.ac.uk/mullerlibrary/collections/louisjacobs.html |title=Louis Jacobs Collection – Leopold Muller Memorial Library |publisher=Ochjs.ac.uk |accessdate=3 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331201859/http://www.ochjs.ac.uk/mullerlibrary/collections/louisjacobs.html |archivedate=31 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loewe Pamphlets Collection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ochjs.ac.uk/mullerlibrary/collections/loewe.html |title=Loewe Pamphlets – Leopold Muller Memorial Library |publisher=Ochjs.ac.uk |accessdate=3 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315100643/http://www.ochjs.ac.uk/mullerlibrary/collections/loewe.html |archivedate=15 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Herbert Loewe]] and his elder son, the library of Jacob H.

Small plasma torches typically use an [[inert gas]] such as [[argon]] where larger torches require [[nitrogen]]. The [[electrode]]s vary from [[copper]] or [[tungsten]] to [[hafnium]] or [[zirconium]], along with various other [[alloy]]s.  A strong electric current under high voltage passes between the two electrodes as an [[electric arc]]. Pressurized inert gas is [[Ionization|ionized]] passing through the plasma created by the arc. The torch's temperature ranges from {{convert|4000|to|25000|F|C|-2}}.&lt;ref name="recoveredenergy"&gt;

=== Feedstocks ===
The feedstock for plasma waste treatment is most often [[municipal solid waste]], [[organic waste]], or both. Feedstocks may also include [[biomedical waste]] and [[Dangerous goods|hazmat]] materials.  Content and consistency of the waste directly impacts performance of a plasma facility. Pre-sorting and recycling useful material before gasification provides consistency. Too much inorganic material such as metal and construction waste increases slag production, which in turn decreases [[syngas]] production. However, a benefit is that the slag itself is chemically inert and safe to handle (certain materials may affect the content of the gas produced, however&lt;ref name=HSW/&gt;). Shredding waste before entering the main chamber helps to increase syngas production. This creates an efficient transfer of energy which ensures more materials are broken down.&lt;ref name=HSW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/plasma-converter.htm| title=How Stuff Works- Plasma Converter|accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For improved processing steam is sometimes added into the plasma gasification process.

=== Yields ===

Pure highly calorific [[syngas|synthesis gas]] consists predominantly of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="synconversion"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inorganic compound]]s in the waste stream are not broken down but melted, which includes glass, ceramics, and various metals.

The high temperature and lack of oxygen prevents the formation of many toxic compounds such as [[furan]]s, [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], [[NOx|nitrogen oxides]], or [[sulfur dioxide]] in the flame itself. However, dioxins are formed during cooling of the syngas.

Metals resulting from plasma [[pyrolysis]] can be recovered from the slag and eventually sold as a commodity. Inert slag produced from some processes is granulated and can be used in construction.  A portion of the syngas produced feeds on-site turbines, which power the plasma torches and thus support the feed system. This is self-sustaining electric power.&lt;ref name="synconversion"/&gt;

=== Equipment ===
Some plasma gasification reactors operate at [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]],&lt;ref name=moustakasa/&gt; but all attempt to recover both&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent

&lt;/ref&gt; and [[incineration]].
* Operational costs are high relative to that of incineration.
* Little or even negative net energy production.
* Wet feed stock results in less syngas production and higher energy consumption.
* Frequent maintenance and limited plant availability.
* For some early technologies, the plasma torch [[Plume (fluid dynamics)|plume]] reduced the diameter of the sampler orifice over time, necessitating frequent maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''''Powell v. State of Georgia''''', [[Case citation|S98A0755, 270 Ga. 327, 510 S.E. 2d 18]] (1998){{ref|citation}} was a decision of the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]].  Powell was charged with a complaint in which he had performed non-consensual oral sex upon his wife's 17-year-old niece in his house.  The jury [[acquit]]ted him of the non-consensual portion of the complaint, but [[convicted]] him of consensual sodomy.

In its appeal, the defense argued the statute was unconstitutional; the state argued that a conviction such as this was explicitly upheld by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in the case of ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'', [[Case citation|478 U.S. 186]] (1986).

In ''Bowers'', the Attorney General of Georgia had conceded that the sodomy law could not be applied to married heterosexuals, given the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]''.  Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] had observed in his ''Bowers'' dissent that ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]'' had extended ''Griswold'' to unmarried heterosexuals, so the sodomy law should not apply to unmarried heterosexuals either.

The Georgia Supreme Court struck down the sodomy statute by a vote of 6-1. The Court found that the individual's right to privacy in the Georgia Constitution are stronger and broader than those in the U.S. Constitution's [[Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. The majority noted that "privacy rights protected by the U.S. Constitution are not at issue in this case," while the dissenting justice cited ''Bowers'' extensively.

Powell's conviction was overturned.

Although this case involved [[heterosexual]] activity, the decision overturned the state's [[sodomy law]] and had the effect of making [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] sexual activity legal in the State of Georgia. Sodomy laws were overturned nationwide five years later, when ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003) overruled ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]''.

== Environmental aspect ==
Electricity from hydro schemes cuts down the use of [[Wood fuel|wood]] for [[cooking]], [[heating]] and [[light]]ing, consequently reducing [[deforestation]] which is a huge problem in the [[Deforestation by region|region]]. The hydro schemes also cut [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, by virtually eliminating the use of [[kerosene]] [[Kerosene lamp|lighting]], cutting the use of [[diesel engine|diesel]] [[Diesel generator|generators]], and also reducing the use of unsustainable wood. A detailed breakdown has not been made of [[Fossil fuel|fuels]] replaced, but an indication of the significance can be made by assuming that the estimated 110,000 [[Kilowatt hour|MWh]] of electricity generated each year replaces diesel generation producing around 0.8 [[tonne]]s of [[carbon dioxide]] per MWh. This suggests a substantial greenhouse gas saving of around 88,000 tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]] per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ashden.org/files/case_studies/SRSP%20Pakistan.pdf|title=Winner case study summary: Sarhad Rural Support Programme, Pakistan.|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|publisher=Ashden Award for Increasing Energy Access, supported by the IKEA Foundation Award|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ashden.org/winners/SRSP15|title=The power of water brings new life to mountain villages|last=|first=|date=2015-06-05|work=|newspaper=Ashden Awards, sustainable and renewable energy in the UK and developing world|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webwidemedia.net/rspn/index.php/about-us/awards-recognition|title=Awards &amp; Recognitions {{!}} RSPN|last=|first=|date=|website=Rural Support Programmes Network (RSPN)|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scroll.in/article/804936/what-the-smart-villages-of-pakistan-can-teach-us-about-energy|title=What the ‘smart villages’ of Pakistan can teach us about energy|last=Cheema|first=Abdur Rehman|date=12 March 2016|newspaper=Scroll.in|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|language=en-US|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used for business and commercial applications as well as for research, education, training, rapid prototyping, and application development and supports all steps of the machine learning process including data preparation, results [[Information visualization|visualization]], model validation and optimization.&lt;ref&gt;Markus Hofmann, Ralf Klinkenberg, “[https://www.amazon.com/RapidMiner-Analytics-Applications-Knowledge-Discovery/dp/1482205491 RapidMiner: Data Mining Use Cases and Business Analytics Applications (Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Series)],” ''CRC Press'', October 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; RapidMiner is developed on an open core model. The RapidMiner Studio Free Edition, which is limited to 1 logical processor and 10,000 data rows is available under the [[GNU Affero General Public License|AGPL]] license.&lt;ref&gt;“[https://rapidminer.com/news-posts/rapidminerembracesitscommunity/”, ''RapidMiner'', September 1, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial pricing starts at $2,500 and is available from the developer.

==History==
'''RapidMiner''', formerly known as YALE (Yet Another Learning Environment), was developed starting in 2001 by Ralf Klinkenberg, Ingo Mierswa, and Simon Fischer at the Artificial Intelligence Unit of the [[Technical University of Dortmund]].&lt;ref&gt;Guido Deutsch, “[http://www.data-mining-blog.com/cloud-mining/rapidminer-cebit-2010/ RapidMiner from Rapid-I at CeBIT 2010],” ''Data Mining Blog'', March 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;   Starting in 2006, its development was driven by Rapid-I, a company founded by Ingo Mierswa and Ralf Klinkenberg in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.kdnuggets.com/2010/02/f-interview-rapid-i-founders.html Interview with RapidMiner's Ingo Mierswa, Ralf Klinkenberg]”, ''KDnuggets'', February, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, the name of the software was changed from YALE to RapidMiner. In 2013, the company rebranded from Rapid-I to RapidMiner.&lt;ref&gt;“[https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/04/german-predictive-analytics-startup-rapid-i-rebrands-as-rapidminer-takes-5m-from-open-ocean-earlybird-to-tackle-the-u-s-market/ German Predictive Analytics Startup Rapid-I Rebrands As RapidMiner]”, ''TechCrunch'', November 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
RapidMiner uses a [[client/server]] model with the server offered as either on-premise, or in public or private cloud infrastructures.&lt;ref&gt;David Norris, “[http://www.it-director.com/content.php?cid=14555 RapidMiner - a potential game changer],” ''IT-Director.com'', November 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bloor Research, RapidMiner provides 99% of an advanced analytical solution through template-based frameworks that speed delivery and reduce errors by nearly eliminating the need to write code. RapidMiner provides [[data mining]] and [[machine learning]] procedures including: data loading and transformation ([[Extract, transform, load]] (ETL)), data preprocessing and visualization, predictive analytics and statistical modeling, evaluation, and deployment. RapidMiner is written in the Java programming language. RapidMiner provides a GUI to design and execute analytical workflows. Those workflows are called “Processes” in RapidMiner and they consist of multiple “Operators”.  Each operator performs a single task within the process, and the output of each operator forms the input of the next one. Alternatively, the engine can be called from other programs or used as an API. Individual functions can be called from the command line. RapidMiner provides learning schemes, models and algorithms and can be extended using [[R (programming language)|R]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] scripts.&lt;ref&gt;David Norris, “[http://www.bloorresearch.com/analysis/rapidminer-a-potential-game-changer/ RapidMiner - a potential game changer],” Bloor Research, November 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

RapidMiner functionality can be extended with additional plugins which are made available via RapidMiner Marketplace. The RapidMiner Marketplace provides a platform for developers to create data analysis algorithms and publish them to the community.&lt;ref&gt;Ajay Ohri, “[http://www.kdnuggets.com/2011/08/ajay-ohri-rapidminer-founder-interview.html Interview with Rapid-I Ingo Mierswa and Simon Fischer],” ''KDnuggets'', August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of a Safety Engineer==

The scope of a safety engineer is to perform their professional functions. Safety engineering professionals must have education, training and experience in a common body of knowledge. They need to have a fundamental knowledge of [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[physiology]], [[statistics]], [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[engineering mechanics]], [[industrial processes]], [[business]], [[communication]] and [[psychology]]. Professional safety studies include [[industrial hygiene]] and [[toxicology]], design of [[engineering hazard control]]s, [[fire protection]], [[ergonomics]], system and [[process safety]], [[system safety]],  safety and health program management, [[accident investigation]] and analysis, [[product safety]], [[construction safety]], education and training methods, measurement of [[safety performance]], [[human behavior]], [[environmental safety and health]], and safety, health and [[environmental law]]s, regulations and standards. Many safety engineers have backgrounds or advanced study in other disciplines, such as management and business administration, engineering, [[system engineering]] / [[industrial engineering]], [[requirements engineering]], [[reliability engineering]], [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]], [[human factors]], operations, education, physical and [[social science]]s and other fields. Others have advanced study in safety. This extends their expertise beyond the basics of the safety engineering profession.

==Functions of a Safety Engineer==

The major areas relating to the protection of people, property and the environment are:


==Personality and role==

Oddly enough, personality issues can be paramount in a safety engineer. They must be personally pleasant, intelligent, and ruthless with themselves and their organization. In particular, they have to be able to "sell" the failures that they discover, as well as the attendant expense and time needed to correct them. They can be the messengers of bad news.

Safety engineers have to be ruthless about getting facts from other engineers. It is common for a safety engineer to consider software, chemical, electrical, mechanical, procedural, and training problems in the same day. Often the facts can be very uncomfortable as many safety related issues point towards mediocre management systems or worse, questionable business ethics.

==Teamwork==

It's difficult and expensive to retrofit safety into an unsafe system.  To prevent safety problems, an organization should therefore treat safety as an early design and "architecture" activity, using the principles of [[Inherent safety]], rather than as a "paperwork requirement" to be cleaned up after the real design is done.

Safety engineers also must work in a team that includes other engineering specialties, quality assurance, quality improvement, regulatory compliance specialists, educators and lawyers.

Subpar safety and quality problems often indicate underlying deficiencies in an organization's goals, recruitment, succession, training, management systems and business culture.

Safety often works well in a true matrix-management organization, in which safety is a managed discipline integrated into a project plan.

In an article in the Brooklyn ''New York Daily News'', staff writer Elizabeth Lazarowitz quotes Steven Zucker, "Art can be really intimidating for people", said Zucker. "If we can make art feel exciting and interesting and very much relevant to a historical moment...art can have real meaning." Unlike reading about art in a book, "the idea of the audio was to keep a student's eyes on the image", he explained. "It helped students to learn the material a lot better."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2011/02/25/2011-02-25_masterpiece_theater_vids_new_way_to_look_at_art.html "Brooklyn-based art historians launch website with videos of masterpieces" New York Daily News, 2/25/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a collaborative article by Beth Harris and Steven Zucker, the founders explain the value of the resource for teachers, students, and informal learners: "Smarthistory is helping teachers who are not specialists in art history find strategies to make the subject accessible and meaningful to students who might otherwise not have cultural resources available to them. And for college students, the site is fast becoming an attractive alternative to the commercial textbook whose short life cycle and $100+ price tag has increasingly become a barrier."&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:bhHeVbf82cEJ:openaccess.uoc.edu/webapps/o2/bitstream/10609/5081/6/Zucker_editat.pdf+beth+harris+smarthistory&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjS1HrPqlUZBCUfp3VYz0UDmX0KBXi1hn_R1Vra7yaTP9uIjdKlRBELcD0KzrArBHzEjHI7bpvF52q0sVV9r7PUl9nYH10GExmuJ_QhmyveHLm9Gpha9t4dckaOwhzwn74C1YUk&amp;sig=AHIEtbT5zd1NJEjqrV1SEwwquFk6RBcNAw "Conversation is Key: A Short History of Smarthistory.org"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''Chronicle for Higher Education'' article, Beth Harris is quoted on the ambitions and goals of Smarthistory: "We really just wanted to re-embed the objects in our world", says Harris, who is the founder and executive editor of Smarthistory as well as the director of digital learning at a New York City museum. "We thought that that would make them more relevant and more engaging for students."&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/%E2%80%98smarthistory%E2%80%99-rethinks-the-art-history-textbook-online/28395 "'Smarthistory' rethinks the art history textbook online"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Engeström maintained that "Social network theory fails to recognise such real-world dynamics because its notion of sociality is limited to just people." Instead, he proposed what he called "object centered sociality," citing the work of the sociologist [[Karin Knorr-Cetina]]. For example, Engeström maintained that much of the success of the popular photo-sharing site [[Flickr]] was because photographs serve as social objects around which conversations of social networks form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Engeström|first=Jyri|title=Why some social network services work and others don’t — Or: the case for object-centered sociality|url=http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2005/04/why-some-social-network-services-work-and-others-dont-or-the-case-for-object-centered-sociality.html|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:F Capodanno Bl South Beach td 06 - Staten Island Bluebelt.jpg|thumb|right|A sign for the Staten Island Bluebelt in [[South Beach, Staten Island|South Beach]].]]
The '''Staten Island Bluebelt''' (also known simply as '''Bluebelt'''), is a large scale system of stormwater [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] (BMPs) that have been under construction on [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], since the early 1990s. The Bluebelt includes structural and nonstructural [[stormwater]] management control measures taken to mitigate changes to both quantity and quality of [[surface runoff|runoff]] caused through changes to land use.

==History==
The Bluebelt program was initiated in the late 1980s by New York City’s [[New York City Department of Environmental Protection|Departments of Environmental Protection]] and [[New York City Department of City Planning|Department of City Planning]], based on a suggestion made several decades earlier by [[Ian McHarg]], a [[landscape architect]].&lt;ref name=unbound&gt;{{cite unbound|pages=319-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acquisition of land began in 1991 for the project,&lt;ref name=unbound /&gt; one of the Northeast United States’ most ambitious stormwater management efforts.  The overall goal is to provide the necessary stormwater drainage infrastructure for a {{convert|12000|acre|km2|adj=on}} region on the southern end of the island while at the same time preserving the last great stand of freshwater wetlands in New York City. The bluebelt uses a series of carefully placed BMPs at the storm sewer/wetland interface to reduce flooding and improve water quality. Creation of a self-regulating ecosystem that is native to the Staten Island region is of primary importance to the program.

BMPs used in the bluebelt include stormwater wetlands, stream restoration, outlet stilling basins, and sand filters. Ninety-two stormwater wetlands are planned for the project, about half of which have been constructed to date (2008). In order to integrate the wetlands into the natural ecology, the construction process is advised by restoration specialists since general contractors are typically not trained in proper plant selection and installation. The planting design focuses on quick establishment of the preferred successional communities that will complement the surrounding landscape, before invasive species take over the site.

The performance of the Bluebelt during the storms that battered Staten Island in the early 21st century &amp;ndash; including [[Hurricane Sandy]] &amp;ndash; has been described as "brilliant".&lt;ref name=unbound /&gt;

The '''thermal power station Regina Margherita''' was a large power station for the production of electricity, preserved at the [[Museo della Scienza e della Tecnologia "Leonardo da Vinci"|Museo nazionale della scienza e della tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci]] in [[Milan]], Italy. The station opened in 1895 and was originally installed in the Egidio e Pio Gavazzi silk factory in [[Desio]] (Milan), where it operated until 1954. It supplied electricity for lighting and for the operation of 1,800 [[loom]]s, generating [[Alternating current|alternating electric current]] at a voltage of 200 V.&lt;ref name="SchedaCERL"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museoscienza.org/dipartimenti/catalogo_collezioni/scheda_oggetto.asp|title=Catalogo collezioni - Centrale termoelettrica Regina Margherita|website=Museoscienza.org|publisher=Museo nazionale scienza e tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci, Milano|language=it|accessdate=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Designed at the [[Polytechnic University of Milan]], it was built by combining a [[steam engine]] from the [[Franco Tosi]] company of [[Legnano]] and a pair of [[alternator]]s from the [[Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie|Brown Boveri]] company.&lt;ref name="genMus"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museoscienza.org/approfondimenti/documenti/centrale_reginamargherita/|title=Centrale Termoelettrica Regina Margherita|website=Museoscienza.org|publisher=Museo nazionale scienza e tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci, Milano|language=it|accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power station opened on November 9, 1895; the ceremony was attended by [[King Umberto I]] and [[Margherita of Savoy]], to whom the plant was dedicated.&lt;ref name="genMus"/&gt;

=== Museum ===
[[File:3421 - Milano - Museo Scienza e tecnica - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 6-Mar-2008.jpg|thumb|Detail]]

In 1958 Egidio e Pio Gavazzi proposed to donate the power plant to the [[Museo della Scienza e della Tecnologia "Leonardo da Vinci"|Museo nazionale della scienza e della tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci]]. In order to exhibit the large machine, the floor was demolished, a stronger basement was built to support the item and the technical press consultation room was moved. Then the Desio plant was dismantled using  maintenance cranes and it was transported with a Riva lorry to the museum, where it was reassembled by hand and connected to an electric motor, coupled with a [[reduction gear]], and set in motion. The furnace and boiler, with their connected steam distribution pipes and pumps, were not transferred to the museum.&lt;ref name="SchedaCERL"/&gt;

== Description ==
The station contains two parts: thermal, consisting of a steam engine with two horizontal cylinders, and electric, consisting of two alternators and two exciter [[dynamo]]s. There is also an electric control panel and a lighting system with 8 lamps.&lt;ref name="SchedaCERL"/&gt; The machine is activated by an electric motor, connected to it by a chain which encircles a [[pulley]], and it no longer produces current.

== Technique ==
This machine is an example of a compound steam engine.&lt;ref name="SchedaCERL"/&gt;

Although it relied on the finest nineteenth-century technologies, the "Regina Margherita" was not a cutting-edge piece of machinery. Ten years before its making, the Englishman Sir [[Charles Algernon Parsons]] had already invented the [[steam turbine]]. In the latter device the force of the steam acts directly on the blades of the wheel, producing the rotation necessary to operate the [[alternator]]s. The steam turbine is more efficient than a cylinder and [[piston]] system because it reduces energy waste from the transformation of alternating motion into rotary motion and from the transmission of movement through connecting rods, cranks and belts.&lt;ref name="genMus"/&gt;

Timelines of [[invention]]s display the development and progression of art, design, architecture, music and literature

==Invention in art, design and architecture==

''dates may be approximations''

* 350,000 BCE – [[Paint]] was invented by early man.  Pigment and paint grinding equipment was found in a cave at Twin Rivers near Lusaka, Zambia.
* 31,000 BCE – Representational painting was invented.  Murals of stampeding bulls, cantering horses, red bears and woolly rhinoceros are found in the [[Chauvet Cave]]s in France.
* 22,000 BCE – [[Sculpture]] was invented by [[Paleolithic]] tribes who created the female statuette called the [[Venus of Willendorf]], found in near Willendorf, Austria.
* 4000 BCE – [[Papyrus]], the precursor to [[paper]], was invented by the Egyptians by pounding flat woven mats of reeds.
* 2500 BCE – Egyptian blue pigment was invented by Egyptian chemists using a mixture of limestone (calcium oxide), malachite (copper oxide) and quartz (silica) fired to about 800–900 degrees Celsius.
* 500 BCE – [[Encaustic painting|Encaustic]] paints are invented by Greek artists by mixing colored pigments and wax.
* 450 BCE – Depicting the illusion of three-dimensional form on a two-dimensional surface was invented with the [[chiaroscuro]] painting technique that employs highlights and shadows.
* 250 BCE – [[Glassblowing]] was invented by Syrian craftsmen in Babylonia.
* 105 – [[Paper]] was invented by Ts’ai Lun, a Chinese court official.
* 650 – [[Porcelain]] was invented by Chinese artists in the Tang Dynasty as a fired mixture of kaolin (a clay) and petuntse (a feldspar).
* 1306 – A more naturalistic means of representational painting was invented by [[Giotto di Bondone]] using depth, perspective and temporal realism to present a single moment in time.
* 15th century – A [[cupola]] or dome which did not require a framework supporting its curves was invented by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]].  To transport the large stones to the construction site, Brunelleschi invented a unique boat capable of moving heavy cargo upriver and was granted exclusive rights to use his boat to move heavy loads, patent rights.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Patenting Art and Entertainment by Gregory Aharonian and Richard Stim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 15th century – [[Linear perspective]] was invented with work by Filippo Brunelleschi, and a treatise on perspective theory by [[Leon Battista Alberti]].   Perspective is a method for depicting the illusion of three-dimensions on a two-dimensional surface.&lt;ref&gt;ArtLex at www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Li.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1420 – The use of a single, consistent light source in painting with figures painted to appear three-dimensional was invented by the Italian artist [[Masaccio]] (Tommaso di Giovanni).  See his 1427 painting, "Tribute Money".
* 1485 – [[Sfumato]], a painting technique in which an atmospheric or blurry effect is created with minute transitions between color areas, was invented by Leonardo da Vinci.  Sfumato is seen in Leonardo's "Virgin on the Rocks" and "[[Mona Lisa]]".
* 1503 – [[Surrealism]] was invented by Flemish artist [[Hieronymus Bosch]] with his triptych "[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]".
* 1774 – [[Jasperware]], a dense vitreous pottery that could be turned on a lathe, was invented by [[Josiah Wedgwood]].
* 1816 – The photograph was invented by Joseph [[Nicephore Niepce]] using paper coated with [[silver chloride]] "fixed" with nitric acid.
* 1816 – a resolution contrast technique of painting and drawing was invented by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] who used it to depict faces in high resolution with the rest of the image in low resolution, as for example in his drawing "Mrs. Charles Badham".
* 1861 – The color photograph was invented by physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]].
* 1863 – Multiple subject painting was invented by [[Édouard Manet]].  His "[[Le dejeuner sur l'herbe]]" presents four disconnected figures not looking at one another, lighted from different directions.  Dejeuner sur l'herbe also has a disconnected background-to-foreground perspective that eliminates the middle ground.
* 1865 – [[Chromolithograph]] prints were invented by [[Jules Chéret]].
* 1872 – Serial photomontage, the precursor to [[motion pictures]], was invented by [[Eadweard Muybridge]] and [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] by using multiple cameras to photograph moving objects.
* 1873 – Nonlinear horizon lines were invented by Édouard Manet, eliminating the horizon line in his 1874 painting "Boating".
* 1882 – Multiple time depiction was invented by Édouard Manet in his ''"[[A Bar at the Folies-Bergère]]"'', which depicts a bar scene from two points in space at two different moments in time.
* 1884 – [[Pointillism]] was invented by [[Georges Seurat]], who created entire paintings using small dots of pure unmixed color.
* 1886 – [[Trompe l'oeil]] was invented by [[William Michael Harnett]], an American painter.
* 1888 – A technique of portraying a subject from different perspectives and of distorting subject matter in painting was invented by [[Paul Cézanne]].
* 1891 – A technique of unfreezing time in still images was invented by [[Claude Monet]], who painted the same subject at many different times during the day, showing how it appeared differently largely due to the change in natural light.  He painted the cathedral at Rouen at 40 different times of the day and he painted the same haystack at 20 different moments in a year.
* 1902- A technique of indeterminate time was invented in painting by Paul Cézanne in his painting "Mont Sainte-Victorie", in which the sources and direction of light are not discernible.
* 1902 – The [[teddy bear]] was invented by Morris and Rose Michtom based on a cartoon of a bear saved by President Theodore Roosevelt.
* 1903 – The 3-D (three-dimensional) movie was invented by [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]] with their one-minute film "L’Arrivée du Train".
* 1904 – [[Fauvism]] was invented by [[Henri Matisse]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[André Derain]] and others.
* 1907 – A variety of special effects for film were invented by [[Georges Méliès]] in his film ''[[Tunneling the English Channel]]'', including stop-motion photography, split-screen photography, [[stop action animation]] and the combination of live action with full-scale mechanical backgrounds.
* 1915 – The multistable image was invented by W. E. Hill, with his drawing "My Wife and My Mother-in-Law", an image that can present either a young woman or an older woman.&lt;ref&gt;''Patenting Art and Entertainment'' by Gregory Aharonian and Richard Stim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1908 to 1917 – [[Cubism]] was invented by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]].  In Cubist artworks, the subject, whether it be a figure or a still life, is broken up and reassembled, and presented from multiple views simultaneously.  Cubism revolutionized western art, and influenced other art forms like music and literature.
* 1912 – [[Collage]] was invented by Picasso with his "Still Life with Chair Caning".  Attaching a material from the real world that was not ever used in high art into a painting violated what was previously considered the integrity of the artwork.  Collage was a new process for making art, a new art form, and it expanded the definition of art.
* 1912 – The [[Construction]] was invented by Picasso when he created "Guitar" in 1912 by joining parts together.  This additive image-making process was new to western sculpture which was previously made using subtractive processes like carving stone or wood, or modeling clay which may have then been cast in metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moodbook.com/history/modernism/pablo-picasso.html |title=Pablo Picasso. Art, life, and world of modern |publisher=Moodbook.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1917 – the [[Readymade]] was invented and exhibited by [[Marcel Duchamp]], "The Fountain" an upturned urinal signed by the artist.  The Readymade expanded the definition of art and of an artist.&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=11&amp;region=na#/Key-Events |title=The United States and Canada, 1900 A.D.–present &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1917 – [[De Stijl]] a kind of art based on pure geometry was invented by [[Theo van Doesburg]].
* 1926 – [[Science fiction]] movies were invented by [[Fritz Lang]] with his movie ''Metropolis'', which incorporates dynamic visual and special effects.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
* 1928 – [[Welded sculpture]], a new medium, a new process and a new art form, was invented by Pablo Picasso and Julio Gonzalez, opening up the solid form of sculpture to negative space and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;World History of Art by Hugh Honour, Laurence King Publishing 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1928 – [[Mickey Mouse]] was created by Walt Disney.&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"/&gt;
* 1929 – [[Film noir]] was invented by [[Josef Sternberg]] with his film ''Thunderbolt''.
* 1932 – The [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobile]] was invented by [[Alexander Calder]].
* 1936 – A device that greatly speeds up the process of making cartoons and enables them to appear more realistic was invented and patented by [[Walt Disney]], who used it to create the classic ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' in 1937.  Refer to US Patent 2,201,689.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
* 1947–50 – Painting was reinvented by [[Jackson Pollock]] whose novel method of spontaneously dripping and splattering paint from a can onto unscratched canvas laid out on the floor brought about an expanded understanding of pure abstraction and of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manythings.org/voa/people/Jackson_Pollock.html |title=and also Michael Kimmelman www.NY Times.com "A Drip by Any Other Name", February 12, 2006 |publisher=Manythings.org |date=2010-02-19 |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1948 – The [[Glass House]] by the architect [[Philip Johnson]] reduced building down to its most basic elements: a horizontal slab on the ground, vertical supports, a flat roof and transparent glass wrapped around it.&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"/&gt;
* 1952 – Stain painting, in which liquid paint soaks and bleeds into the fabric of unprimed canvas, was invented by [[Joan Miró]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]] and [[Jackson Pollock]] who influenced [[Helen Frankenthaler]], as seen in her painting "Mountains and Sea" of 1952.
* 1959 – the first public "[[happening]]" was produced by Allan Kaprow at the Reuben Gallery in New York.  A happening is defined by Kaprow as a choreographed event that facilitates interactions between objects including performers and visitors.  Happenings were influenced by Jackson Pollock's process of action painting, Dada and the teachings of John Cage on chance and indeterminacy.&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3943">A '''toxicophore''' is a [[chemical]] structure or a portion of a structure (e.g., a [[functional group]]) that is related to the toxic properties of a chemical. Toxicophores can act directly (e.g., [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]]) or can require [[Drug metabolism|metabolic]] activation (e.g., [[tobacco-specific nitrosamines]]).

Most toxic substances exert their [[toxicity]] through some interaction (e.g., [[covalent bond]]ing, [[oxidation]]) with cellular [[macromolecule]]s like [[protein]]s or [[DNA]]. This interaction leads to changes in the normal cellular [[biochemistry]] and [[physiology]] and downstream toxic effects.
Occasionally, the toxicophore requires [[Biological activity|bioactivation]], mediated by [[enzyme]]s, to produce a more reactive metabolite that is more toxic. For example, [[tobacco-specific nitrosamines]] are activated by [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes to form a more reactive substance that can covalently bind to DNA, causing mutations that, if not [[DNA repair|repaired]], can lead to cancer. Generally, different chemical compounds that contain the same toxicophore elicit similar toxic effects at the same site of toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:Old Market Roundabout, Bristol.jpg|thumb|The engineering of this [[roundabout]] in [[Bristol]], England, attempts to make traffic flow free-moving]]

'''Transportation engineering''' or '''transport engineering''' is the application of technology and [[scientific principle]]s to the planning, functional design, operation and management of facilities for any mode of transportation in order to provide for the safe, efficient, rapid, comfortable, convenient, economical, and environmentally compatible movement of people and goods ([[transport]]) {{citation needed|reason=What is the source of this very specific definition|date=February 2016}}.  It is a sub-discipline of [[civil engineering]].&lt;ref name="Institute of Transportation Engineering"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ite.org/career/index.asp|title=ITE – The Transportation Profession|work=ITE|accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of transportation engineering within the civil engineering profession can be judged by the number of divisions in [[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] (American Society of Civil Engineers) that are directly related to transportation. There are six such divisions (Aerospace; Air Transportation; Highway; Pipeline; Waterway, Port, Coastal and Ocean; and Urban Transportation) representing one-third of the total 18 technical divisions within the ASCE (1987).&lt;ref name="American Society of Civil Engineers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asce.org/ProgramProductLine.aspx?id=2147485055|title=ASCE – About Civil Engineering|work=ASCE|accessdate=2010-06-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702022026/http://www.asce.org/ProgramProductLine.aspx?id=2147485055|archivedate=2 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The planning aspects of transportation engineering relate to elements of [[urban planning]], and involve technical forecasting decisions and political factors.  Technical forecasting of passenger travel usually involves an urban transportation planning model, requiring the estimation of [[trip generation]] (how many trips for what purpose), [[trip distribution]] (destination choice, where is the traveler going), [[mode choice]] (what [[mode of transport|mode]] is being taken), and [[route assignment]] (which streets or routes are being used).  More sophisticated forecasting can include other aspects of traveler decisions, including auto ownership, trip chaining (the decision to link individual trips together in a tour) and the choice of residential or business location (known as [[land use forecasting]]). Passenger trips are the focus of transportation engineering because they often represent the peak of demand on any transportation system.

A review of descriptions of the scope of various committees indicates that while facility planning and design continue to be the core of the transportation engineering field, such areas as operations planning, logistics, network analysis, financing, and policy analysis are also important to civil engineers, particularly to those working in highway and urban transportation. The National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) list online the safety protocols, geometric design requirements, and signal timing.

Transportation engineering, as practiced by civil engineers, primarily involves planning, design, construction, maintenance, and operation of transportation facilities. The facilities support air, highway, railroad, pipeline, water, and even space transportation.&lt;ref name="Institute of Transportation Engineering"/&gt; The design aspects of transportation engineering include the sizing of transportation facilities (how many lanes or how much capacity the facility has), determining the materials and thickness used in [[Pavement (roads)|pavement]] designing the geometry (vertical and horizontal alignment) of the roadway (or track).

Before any planning occurs the Engineer must take what is known as an inventory of the area or if it is appropriate, the previous system in place. This inventory or database must include information on (1)population, (2)land use, (3)economic activity, (4)transportation facilities and services, (5)travel patterns and volumes, (6)laws and ordinances, (7)regional financial resources, (8)community values and expectations. These inventories help the engineer create business models to complete accurate forecasts of the future conditions of the system[[Review]].

Operations and management involve [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]], so that vehicles move smoothly on the road or track.  Older techniques include [[Traffic sign|sign]]s, [[Traffic light|signals]], [[Road surface marking|marking]]s, and [[Toll road|toll]]ing.  Newer technologies involve [[intelligent transportation systems]], including advanced traveler information systems (such as [[variable message signs]]), advanced traffic control systems (such as [[ramp meter]]s), and [[vehicle infrastructure integration]]. [[Human factors]] are an aspect of transportation engineering, particularly concerning driver-vehicle interface and user interface of road signs, signals, and markings.

==Highway engineering==
{{Main article|Highway engineering}}
Engineers in this specialization:
*Handle the planning, design, construction, and operation of highways, roads, and other vehicular facilities as well as their related bicycle and pedestrian realms.
*Estimate the transportation needs of the public and then secure the funding for the project.
*Analyze locations of high traffic volumes and high collisions for safety and capacity.
*Use [[civil engineering]] principles to improve the transportation system.
*Utilizes the three design controls which are the drivers, the vehicles, and the roadways themselves.

==Railroad engineering==
{{main article|Railway systems engineering}}
Railway engineers handle the design, construction, and operation of railroads and mass transit systems that use a fixed guideway (such as [[light rail]] or even [[monorails]]).  Typical tasks would include determining horizontal and vertical alignment design, station location and design, and construction cost estimating.  Railroad engineers can also move into the specialized field of train dispatching which focuses on train movement control.

Railway engineers also work to build a cleaner and safer transportation network by reinvesting and revitalizing the rail system to meet future demands.  In the United States, railway engineers work with elected officials in Washington, D.C. on rail transportation issues to make sure that the rail system meets the country's transportation needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aar.org/AAR/About-Us.aspx|title=Association of American Railroads|work=AAR|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Port and harbor engineering==
{{Distinguish|Naval architecture|marine engineering}}
{{Expand section|date=November 2018}}
Port and harbor engineers handle the design, construction, and operation of ports, harbors, canals, and other maritime facilities.

==Airport engineering==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
Airport engineers design and construct airports.  Airport engineers must account for the impacts and demands of aircraft in their design of airport facilities. These engineers must use the analysis of predominant wind direction to determine runway orientation, determine the size of runway border and safety areas, different wing tip to wing tip clearances for all gates and must designate the clear zones in the entire port.

The '''University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point''' (also known as '''UW–Stevens Point''' or '''UWSP''') is a public university in [[Stevens Point, Wisconsin|Stevens Point]], [[Wisconsin]], United States. It is part of the [[University of Wisconsin System]]. It grants associate, baccalaureate and master's degrees, as well as doctoral degrees in audiology.

==History==
After securing land and funding from the City of Stevens Point and [[Portage County, Wisconsin|Portage County]] and winning the right to host the new [[normal school]], '''Stevens Point Normal School''' opened on September 17, 1894 with 201 students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pchswi.org/archives/schools/uwsp/uwsp_main.htm "University of Wisconsin – Stevens Point"], Malcolm Rosholt Online Archives, Portage County Historical Society, retrieved June 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to teacher preparation, "domestic science" ([[home economics]]) and conservation education were offered; the latter formed the basis for the College of Natural Resources, nationally recognized{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} for undergraduate and graduate training in natural resources.

In 1927, Stevens Point Normal School became '''Central State Teachers College''' and began offering four-year teaching degrees. When post-[[World War II]] enrollment became less centered on teacher training and more focused on liberal arts education, the [[Wisconsin State Legislature]] intervened, changing the school's name to '''Wisconsin State College–Stevens Point''' with the authority to grant bachelor's degrees in liberal arts.

Ever larger numbers of students in the 1950s and 1960s led to construction on campus throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. It was during this period, in 1964, that the college was elevated to university status as '''Wisconsin State University–Stevens Point''' and began offering graduate degrees. Seven years later, the Wisconsin State Universities merged into the University of Wisconsin system, and the school adopted its current name. UW-Stevens Point has more than 77,000 alumni. More than half of these alumni live in Wisconsin. In 1968, UW-Stevens Point formed the [[Northwoods battalion]], an ROTC unit for the United States army.

[[Lee S. Dreyfus]] became chancellor in 1974 before becoming Wisconsin's 40th governor. Governor Dreyfus was inaugurated on the lawn in front of Old Main on the UW-Stevens Point campus in 1979.

In 2007, a sustainability task force was created to help achieve the future goal of a carbon neutral campus.

In 2009, Chancellor Linda Bunnell resigned after a student vote of no-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Gatz, [http://www.waow.com/story/10236481/uwsp-chancellor-announces-resignation?clienttype=printable/ "UWSP chancellor announces resignation"], [[WAOW]], April 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The vote in part was called because of an automobile accident she failed to report and allegations of drunken driving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/Polarizing-Chancellor-at/42799 "'Polarizing' Chancellor at U. of Wisconsin-Stevens Point Quits After Hit-and-Run Incident"], ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', April 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Bernie Patterson became chancellor in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Finkelmeyer, [http://host.madison.com/news/local/education/campus_connection/campus-connection-walker-s-plan-would-send-uwsp-back-to/article_8687beec-3f8e-11e0-9cdf-001cc4c002e0.html "Campus Connection: Walker's plan 'would send UWSP back to 19th century'"], ''The Capital Times'', February 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus hosted the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] of the [[National Football League]] for their first training camp in 1995. It was part of what then was known as the ''Cheese League'', a collection of teams that conducted training camp in Wisconsin. Since 1996, the Jaguars have conducted their training camp in [[Jacksonville]].

==Campus==

'''World Computer Exchange''' (WCE) is a United States Canada based charity organization whose mission is "to reduce the [[digital divide]] for youth in developing countries, to use our global network of partnerships to enhance communities in these countries, and to promote the reuse of electronic equipment and its ultimate disposal in an environmentally responsible manner." According to [[UNESCO]], it is North America's largest non-profit supplier of tested used computers to schools and community organizations in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;

== History ==

The organization was founded in 1999 by Timothy Anderson.
&lt;ref&gt;http://bcm.bc.edu/issues/winter_2011/works/net-worker.html&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://earth911.com/news/2010/12/06/earth911-holiday-charity-spotlight-world-computer-exchange/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/publications/hks-magazine/archives/winter-2012/classnotes#1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization is a [[non-profit organization]], and tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) in the US.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbb.org/charity-reviews/national/education-and-literacy/world-computer-exchange-in-hull-ma-7108/tax-status&lt;/ref&gt;
WCE headquarters is in Hull, Massachusetts, and there are 15 chapters in the USA and five in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcomputerexchange.org/chapters&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://williamsreport.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/around-town-2/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcdigitalworkshop.com/2013/fcdw-partners-with-world-computer-exchange/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://studentinvolvement.orgsync.com/show_profile/55954-world-computer-exchange-wsu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.facebook.com/WCEPalouse&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015, WCE opened a chapter in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;https://prcorpfiling.f1hst.com/CorpInfo/CorporationInfo.aspx?c=353066-122&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2002, the organisation shipped 4,000 computers to 585 schools in many developing countries.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/New-life-for-old-PCs-Nonprofit-group-collects-2770167.php&lt;/ref&gt;

By October, 2011, along with partner organizations, WCE has shipped 30,000 computers, established 2,675 computer labs.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebcobserver.com/2011/10/18/winston-center-welcomes-world-computer-exchange-president-founder/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcomputerexchange.org/about-us&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, Boston chapter (also headquarters chapter) in Hull, Massachusetts sent out their 68th shipment bringing their total to 13,503 computers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcomputerexchange.org/boston-ma&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities==

WCE provides computers and technology, and the support to make them useful in the developing communities. WCE delivers educational content and curriculum on agriculture, health entrepreneurship, and even water and energy. The program also ensures that teachers will know how to use the technology and content by providing staff and teacher training, as well as ongoing tech team support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EdTech for the Third World: Tech Tools|url=http://takefiveblog.org/2013/04/18/edtech-for-the-third-world-tech-tools/|work= EdTech for the Third World: Tech Tools|publisher=George Washington University Institute for Public Policy and Global Communication|accessdate=29 April 2013|date=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each chapter of WCE collects donated computers, refurbishes and prepares the shipment for the projects. While preparing shipments, they also raise funds to ship the computers.&lt;ref&gt;http://bostoncares.force.com/HOC__Organization_Profile_Page?Oid=001A000000bA6nJIAS&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcomputerexchange.org/volunteer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/recycling/stories/electronics-recycling&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://artsdigitalera.com/organizations-donating-used-laptops-to-developing-nations/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcdigitalworkshop.com/2013/fcdw-partners-with-world-computer-exchange/&lt;/ref&gt;
Volunteers of WCE chapters inspect each computer, repair if necessary, install operating system as well as educational material to each computer.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.vmware.com/careers/2011/11/vmware-foundation-employees-give-back-the-world-computer-exchange.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcomputerexchange.org/chicago-il&lt;/ref&gt;

WCE calls recipients of its computers "partners." The requests of computer donations originate from the partners. Once the refurbished computers and the funds to ship the computers are fulfilled, WCE initiates shipment. When possible, WCE coordinates the shipments of computers with other non-profit organizations, such as [[University of the People]], [[Peace Corps]],&lt;ref&gt;http://playbook.peacecorpsict4d.org/toolkits/grants-and-funding/&lt;/ref&gt; Computers4Africa.org,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computers4africa.org/impact/beneficiaries.htm&lt;/ref&gt; ADEA (Assoc. for the development of Education in Africa) and others.

In November 2015, WCE sent two 2 Spanish speakers to visit Honduras for 2 weeks in 2015 to pilot an employable tech skills training for youth under a WCE contract with [[World Vision]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcomputerexchange.org/ecorps&lt;/ref&gt;

The WCE Computers for Girls (C4G) initiative is field testing of eight tools to provide technological training and [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] education for interested teachers helping their girl students in four West African countries (Ghana, Liberia, Mali, and Zambia)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcomputerexchange.org/Computers-for-Girls&lt;/ref&gt; and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcomputerexchange.org/computers-girls-pakistan&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, World Computer Exchange-Puerto Rico and 4GCommunity.org, two not-for-profit corporations, have announced their alliance to improve public school and family access to technology where needed throughout Puerto Rico.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caribbeannewsnow.com/topstory-Non-profit-alliance-works-to-improve-access-to-technology-in-Puerto-Rico-31695.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== eCorps==
To install the computers at a partner site without access to experts otherwise, WCE recruits and supports [[volunteering|volunteers]] from the USA under its "eCorp" initiative. To be eligible, volunteers must be 21 years of age, have necessary tech skills, and be prepared to self-fund their travel and accommodation expenses. 18 eCorps training teams have worked in Dominican Republic (2), Ethiopia, Georgia, Ghana (2), Honduras, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Tanzania (4), and Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcomputerexchange.org/ecorps&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.volunteerforever.com/volunteer_profile/bryan-barton&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://worldcomputerexchange.org/ecorps-nicaragua-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The eCorps "Travelers" program is geared towards those already planning to go to one of the countries in the WCE network, to provide tech support during their trip.  79 eCorps "Travelers" have visited the following 41 developing countries including: Armenia, Bolivia (2), Cambodia, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Dominican Republic (2), Ecuador, Ethiopia, Haiti, Honduras, India (2), Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya (2), Liberia, Malawi, Mexico (2), Namibia, Nepal, Pakistan, Palestine, Panama, Peru (2), Puerto Rico, Qatar, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa (2), Swaziland, Tanzania (2), Togo, and Uganda.  In FY'15, "Travelers" visited: Cambodia, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcomputerexchange.org/ecorps&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computers ==
WCE uses [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] operating system to prepare computers, citing the cost of license and less prone computer viruses while providing sufficient computing environment such as [[word processor]] and [[printer driver]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcomputerexchange.org/why-ubuntu&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike [[One Laptop per Child]], the prepared computers do not contain specialized software. Each computer is loaded with educational materials which allows users to learn materials without internet connection.
