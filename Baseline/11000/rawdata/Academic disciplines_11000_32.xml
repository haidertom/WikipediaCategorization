'''Architectural analytics''' is the field of study that focuses on the discovery and identification of meaningful patterns in [[architecture]].

Architecture represents a snapshot in time and can, in a very detailed fashion, animate the [[civilisation]] and people that created it. Architectural analytics can allow a large amount of information about a monument, settlement or civilisation to be discerned. This ability to inform and present previously unknown facts makes architectural analytics important in piecing together the larger understanding of civilisations and the human story.

'''''Art by Women in Florence: A Guide through Five Hundred Years''''' is a 2012 book written by [[Jane Fortune]] and Linda Falcone through The [[Advancing Women Artists Foundation]] and published by The Florentine Press. ''Art by Women in Florence'' is adapted from the book ''[[Invisible Women: Forgotten Artists of Florence]]'' as a pocket-size guidebook through [[Florence, Italy|Florence's]] museums showcasing over eighty paintings and sculptures by more than sixty women artists.&lt;ref name="art by women in florence"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortune|first=Jane|title=Art by Women in Florence: A Guide through Five Hundred Years|year=2012|publisher=The Florentine Press|location=Florence, Italy|isbn=978-88-97696-01-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="art by women in florence site"&gt;{{cite web|title=Art by Women in Florence|url=http://www.theflorentinepress.com/art-by-women-in-florence/|publisher=The Florentine Press|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proceeds derived from ''Art by Women in Florence'' support projects sponsored by the Advancing Women Artists Foundation in their work to research, restore, and exhibit artwork by women in Florence's museums and storehouses.&lt;ref name="AWA art by women in florence cite"&gt;{{cite web|title=Art by Women in Florence: A Guide through Five Hundred Years |url=http://www.advancingwomenartists.org/art-by-women.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723165602/http://advancingwomenartists.org/art-by-women.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 July 2013 |publisher=Advancing Women Artists Foundation |accessdate=24 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
''Art by Women in Florence: A Guide through Five Hundred Years'' is divided into eight sections, including a brief segment on unexhibited paintings, and provides a fold-out map of Florence delineating twenty locations housing viewable artwork.&lt;ref name="AWA art by women in florence cite" /&gt;  (See full list below.)

The book points to a number of religious paintings in Florence's churches including works by [[Suor Plautilla Nelli]], the city's first known woman artist (2) such as her ''Lamentation with Saints'' in the [[San Marco Museum]]. Visitors to [[Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence|Santa Maria del Carmine]] will find a burial monument by FÃ©lice de Fauveau, considered to be one of the most preeminent marble sculptures of the nineteenth century. ''Art by Women in Florence'' spotlights [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], a seventeenth-century [[Baroque]] master known to depict historical and mythical heroines. A significant portion of the guide showcases self-portraiture in the [[Vasari Corridor]]. These protagonists include the wildly popular [[Angelica Kauffmann]] whose work inspired designs for high-class housewares at the peak of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and [[Cecilia Beaux]] the earliest American invited to contribute to the Corridor's self-portrait collection. (2) ''Art by Women in Florence'' guides the reader to the outskirts of Florence to explore various [[Medici]] villas hosting works by numerous women including [[Lavinia Fontana]], the first female painter to receive a public commission in Italy, and seventeenth-century court artist [[Giovanna Fratellini]].&lt;ref name="AWA art by women in florence cite" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3206">[[Image:Lowell blink comparator.jpg|thumb|150px|This blink comparator at [[Lowell Observatory]] was used in the discovery of Pluto.]]
A '''blink comparator''' was a viewing apparatus used by [[astronomer]]s to find differences between two [[Astrophotography|photographs of the night sky]].  It permitted rapidly switching from viewing one photograph to viewing the other, "blinking" back and forth between the two taken of the same area of the sky at different times.  This allowed the user to more easily spot objects in the night sky that changed position.  It was also sometimes known as a '''blink microscope'''.  It was invented by physicist [[Carl Pulfrich]] at [[Carl Zeiss AG]], then constituted as Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung, in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Zeiss inventions http://www.zeiss.com/corporate/en_de/events/international-year-of-light/optical-technologies.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In photographs taken a few days apart, rapidly moving objects such as [[asteroid]]s and [[comet]]s would stand out, because they would appear to be jumping back and forth between two positions, while all the other fixed stars remained stationary.  Photographs taken at longer intervals could be used to detect stars with large [[proper motion]], or [[variable star]]s, or to distinguish [[binary star]]s from [[optical double]]s.

The most notable body to be found using this technique was [[Pluto]], discovered by [[Clyde Tombaugh]] in 1930.

The Projection Blink Comparator (PROBLICOM), invented  by amateur astronomer [[Ben Mayer]], was a low-cost version of the professional tool. It consisted of two [[slide projector]]s with a rotating occluding disk that alternatingly blocked the images from the projectors. This tool allowed [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]] to contribute to some phases of serious research.

== Modern replacements ==
In modern times, [[Charge-coupled device|CCDs]] have largely replaced [[photographic plate]]s and astronomical images are stored digitally on computer.  The blinking technique can easily be performed on a computer screen rather than with a physical blink comparator apparatus as before.&lt;ref&gt;Blink Comparator on PC http://www.instructables.com/id/Blink_Comparator_on_Personal_Computer&lt;/ref&gt;

The blinking technique is less used today because [[image differencing]] algorithms detect moving objects more effectively than [[Visual system|human eyes]] can.  To measure the precise position of a known object whose direction and rate of motion are known, a "track [[Shift-and-add|and stack]]" software technique is used. Multiple images are superimposed such that the moving object is fixed in place; the moving object then stands out as a dot among the [[star trail]]s.  This is particularly effective in cases where the moving object is very faint and superimposing multiple images of it permits it to be seen better.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3945">A '''body broker''' (also '''non-transplant tissue banks''') is a firm or an individual that buys and sells [[cadaver]]s or [[human body]] parts.

Whereas the market for [[organ transplantation]] is heavily regulated in the United States, the use of cadaver parts for research, training, and other uses is not. Trade in these body parts is performed in a manner akin to [[raw material]]s, though many brokers say they charge fees as opposed to selling body parts.&lt;ref name="ReutersPart1"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-bodies-brokers/ In the U.S. market for human bodies, almost anyone can dissect and sell the dead], Reuters, Brian Grow and John Shiffman, 25 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas [[body snatching]] was a common way of acquiring bodies for research up until the 20th century, modern body brokers usually receive cadavers via [[body donation]].&lt;ref&gt;Garment, Ann, et al. "Let the dead teach the living: the rise of body bequeathal in 20th-century America." Academic Medicine 82.10 (2007): 1000-1005.&lt;/ref&gt; Body brokers often offer free [[cremation]] as a means to induce donation from families who are unable to pay [[funeral]] costs, returning ashes of part of the body to the next of kin.&lt;ref name="ReutersPart2"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-bodies-cody/ A Reuters journalist bought human body parts, then learned a donor's heart-wrenching story], Reuters, Brian Grow and John Shiffman, 25 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases body brokers obtain bodies [[fraud|fraudulently]] by stating use of the donation for research, subsequently reselling the body for profit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-bodybrokers-industry/ How the body of an Arizona great-grandmother ended up as part of a U.S. Army blast test], Reuters, John Shiffman, 23 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Body brokers also obtain cadavers and body parts from institutions who receive donations and have a surplus. In some cases, this is done illegally against the donor's wishes or by employees who act independently of the institution. In 2004, the UCLA Willed Body Program was suspended for a year after a scheme for the sale of body parts for profit involving its director at the time [[Henry Reid]] and body broker named Ernest Nelson was uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/07/AR2007030702124.html 2 Charged in UCLA Cadaver Scandal], Washington Post AP wire, Robert Jablon, 7 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/12/us/in-science-s-name-lucrative-trade-in-body-parts.html In Science's Name, Lucrative Trade in Body Parts], New York Times, SANDRA BLAKESLEE, JOHN M. BRODER, CHARLIE LEDUFF, ANDREW POLLACK and WRITTEN BY MR. BRODER, 12 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt;. The scheme yielded some 1.5 million dollars in profits. Reid and Nelson were subsequently convicted for theft and related tax offenses and were sentenced to 4 and 10 years respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Cadaver-Body-Parts-Supplier-Gets-10-Years.html Human Body Parts Supplier Gets 10 Years], NBC LA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/may/15/local/me-willedbody15 Businessman found guilty in UCLA's willed body-parts program scandal], LA Times, Jack Leonard 15 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/18/local/me-willedbody18 Guilty plea in cadaver scheme at UCLA], LA Times, Victoria Kim, October 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1436">The '''cam plastometer''' is a [[physical test]]ing machine. It measures the resistance of non-brittle materials to compressive deformation at constant true-strain rates. In this way, it can be compared a bit to the [[Gleeble_Systems|Gleeble(R)]]. In the early days, the machine operates at relatively low [[strain rate]]s, but over time it has been enhanced and currently it can operate over a wide range of strain rates&lt;ref&gt;J.E. Hockett and N.A. Lindsay, Journal of Physics E: Scientific Instruments 4 (1971), 520-522.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The machine is [[patent]]ed under the name of "United States Patent 4109516".&lt;ref name="patent"&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4109516.html Cam plastometer (freepatentsonline.com)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the machine, deformation compressive forces are applied to a specimen by two flat, opposing [[platen]]s which impact a flat, rectangular specimen. The deformation forces can be varied during operation, to simulate actual conditions which occur during industrial pressing and forming operations. The plastometer is also capable of torsional testing of specimens".&lt;ref name="patent" /&gt; 

The cam plastometers are expensive and there are only a few of them in the world.&lt;ref&gt;G.E. Dieter et al., ''Handbook of Workability and Process Design'', ASM International 2003, page 49&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Religion in Egypt}}
The '''Catechetical School of Alexandria''' was a school of Christian [[theologians]] and priests in [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;How Alexandrian was Clement of Alexandria? Reflections on Clement and his Alexandrian Background A Hoek - The Heythrop Journal, 1990 "... Eusebius had a special connection with Alexandrian theology.6 He had direct contact with the tradition of the catechetical school of Alexandria via his teacher Pamphilus, a presbyter of Caesarea who was martyred around 310"&lt;/ref&gt; The teachers and students of the school (also known as the '''Didascalium''') were influential in many of the early [[Christian theology|theological]] controversies of the [[Christian church]]. It was one of the two major centers of the study of biblical [[exegesis]] and [[theology]] during Late Antiquity, the other being the [[School of Antioch]].

According to [[Jerome]] the Alexandrian school was founded by [[Mark the Apostle]]. The earliest recorded dean was supposedly [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras]] (176).{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} He was succeeded by [[Pantaenus]] 181, who was succeeded as head of the school by his student [[Clement of Alexandria]] in 190.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, F.L.; Livingstone, E.A., eds. (1974). "Clement of Alexandria, St.". The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (2 ed.). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable theologians with a connection to the school include [[Origen]], [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]], [[Heraclas]], [[Dionysius of Alexandria|Dionysius "the Great"]], and [[Didymus the Blind]].  Others, including [[Jerome]] and [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil]], made trips to the school to interact with the scholars there.

Continuity with the ancient school is claimed by the [[Coptic Theological Seminary]], Cairo.

==Beginning==
The Catechetical School of Alexandria is the oldest [[Catechesis|catechetical school]] in the world. [[Jerome]] records that the Christian School of Alexandria was founded by St. [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]] himself&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/patrology/schoolofalex/I-Intro/chapter1.html|title=The School of Alexandria - Part I - An Introduction to the School of Alexandria|website=www.copticchurch.net|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first manager appointed by Saint Mark was Saint [[Justus of Alexandria|Justus]], who later became the sixth bishop of Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614171012/http://www.lacopts.org/index.php/site/entry/1970/|title=Saint Mark and the Church of Alexandria|date=2006-06-14|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is another opinion that the school was founded mid-second century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9005632/School-of-Alexandria|title=School of Alexandria {{!}} institution, Alexandria, Egypt|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; around 190 A.D.

Under the leadership of the scholar [[Pantaenus]], the school of Alexandria became an important institution of religious learning, where students were taught by scholars such as [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras]], [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]], [[Didymus the Blind|Didymus]], and the great [[Origen]], who was considered the father of theology and who was also active in the field of commentary and comparative Biblical studies. Many scholars, such as [[Jerome]], visited the school of Alexandria to exchange ideas and to communicate directly with its scholars.

[[Image:ClemensVonAlexandrien.jpg|thumb|Clement of Alexandria (c.&amp;nbsp;150â211/216).]]
The scope of this school was not limited to theological subjects. Apart from subjects like theology, Christian philosophy and the Bible;  science, mathematics and Greek &amp; Roman literature, logic and the arts were also taught. The question-and-answer method of commentary began there, and, 15 centuries before [[Braille]], blind students at the school were using wood-carving techniques to read and write.

==Alexandria before the Catechetical School==

"For about two centuries before the birth of Christ, and the same period after it, Alexandria was the great seat of intellectual culture and home of Greek philosophy.  It was the joining point between three continents, and became the battle-ground, where the religions of the East were brought face to face with the philosophical creeds of the West, and where both were represented by their ablest champions." &lt;ref&gt; Gilmartin, T., Manual of Church History, Vol.I, 1890&lt;/ref&gt;...

"The story of Alexandria begins with [[Alexander the Great]]. Having conquered Egypt, he tasked [[Ptolemy Lagus]] to building Alexandria. The streets were based on Aristotle's ideal urban plan; they were designed on a rectangular grid and oriented south-west to provide shelter from the north wind and take advantage of the westerly breeze. Next to the [[Serapeum]] stood the Daughter Library. It was open to the public and according to the poet [[Callimachus]] contained 42,800 books.  At the heart of the classical city lay the [[Museion]], the first public research institution, and the Great Library, said to contain 700,000 scrolls.  The Museum and the Library were not open to the public but reserved for scholars who undertook research in philology, the mathematical sciences and astrology.  Both institutions were famed for their accomplishments.  The school of mathematics had been founded by [[Euclid]] in the fourth century BC. The first director of the Library, [[Eratosthenes]], was the first person to calculate the circumference of the earth, coming within two per cent of modern measurements." &lt;ref&gt; Mojsov, Bojana, Alexandria Lost, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;...

==The Catechetical School==

"The School's purpose was to supply defenders of the Christian Faith.  It did not attain a world-wide fame till Pantaenus became its teacher.  He was a native of Sicily, and, before his conversion to Christianity, a Stoic philosopher. It is said that he was converted by one of the disciples of St Mark.  He became head of the Catechetical School about 180.  He immediately set about introducing those changes that contributed largely to its future celebrity.  The union which he effected between theology and philosophy. Clement, the successor of Pantaenus viewed the union with suspicion." &lt;ref&gt; Gilmartin, T., Manual of Church History, Vol.I, 1890&lt;/ref&gt;...

The supporters of Pantaenus "looked on this philosophy as a 'Gift of God', a 'Work of Divine Providence,' which was intended to be for the Gentiles what the Law has been for the Jew, viz,. the means of their justification and a preparation for the Gospel. They held, that between revealed religion and philosophy, thus understood and explained, there can be no antagonism; but that, on the contrary, the latter can be made subservient to the interests of the former in various ways:
(a) by training the mind to think and reason accurately, and thus prepare the mind for the higher study of theology.
(b) by supplying proofs and illustrations of many truths common to the two sciences.
(c) by unfolding and throwing into scientific shape the truths of Revelation.

This union was opposed by the 'Positive Teachers' of the Western Church, especially by [[Tertullian]] and [[St Cyprian]].

Pantaenus' successor was Titus Flavius Clement, [[Clement of Alexandria]] in 192, Clement was his appointed successor.  His lectures were attended by large numbers of pagans.  He commenced with those truths that could be demonstrated from philosophy, for the purpose of leading his hearers by degrees to embrace the Christian faith. He did not confine himself to oral instruction.  He wrote numerous works for the benefit of those who could not attend his lectures.  

In 202 he fled to Palestine because of the persecution of [[Septimius Severus]].  After four years he returned".&lt;ref&gt; Gilmartin, T., Manual of Church History, Vol.I, 1890&lt;/ref&gt;...

"The first great figures of the Church in Egypt were scholars rather than bishops, directors of the Catechetical School of Alexandria: Clement (160-215) and Origen (185-251). Both were versed in Greek philosophy and their lives' work was one of great integration: they transformed Christianity from a localised cult for the poorest class into a fully-fledged religion with a philosophy and a cosmology."&lt;ref&gt; Mojsov, Bojana, Alexandria Lost, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;...

==End of this School==

"The Council of Constantinople, convened in 381," a little while after the death of Saint Athanasius, [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], "had far-reaching effects for Egypt: it declared that the bishop of Constantinople was second only to the bishop of Rome and officially undermined the primacy of Alexandria.  The riots that followed in Alexandria were so violent that the Catechetical School, which had remained a force in the intellectual life of the city for nearly two centuries, was destroyed. However, it was reopened in a different location in 1893."&lt;ref&gt; Mojsov, Bojana, Alexandria Lost, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;...

==Origen's work==

"Origen undertook this great work to vindicate the [[Septuagint]] version of the Bible.  The original manuscript was preserved in Caesarea, where it was said to have been destroyed by the Arabs when the city was taken by them in 653.  It was Origen, who is generally looked on as the father of biblical criticism, that gave the Catechetical School of Alexandria the high character it enjoyed for biblical studies.  He was the first to draw a clear distinction between the different senses which Sacred Scripture can have, viz., the ''literal'', the ''moral'', and the ''mystical'' or ''allegorical''."&lt;ref&gt; Gilmartin, T., Manual of Church History, Vol.I, 1890&lt;/ref&gt;...

"Origen has been charged with fallen into various errors:  (a) It has been alleged that he taught an inequality between the Father and the Son. Hence, claimed by the Arians in favour of their stand. (b) While admitting the creation of spirit and matter, he held that creation must have been eternal, as otherwise, God should not have had anything over which He could have exercised His power from eternity. (c) He held that the number of spirits originally created was final, and that the souls of men are but fallen spirits, condemned to bodies for the purpose of penance and purification; hence, Christ's soul also existed before His body.  (d) All punishment is primarily corrective, being ordained that creatures may attain their end; therefore, the torments of hell are not eternal.  This is from his work, ''On Principles'', which he wrote in his earlier years.  It is difficult to determine how far Origen held these.  We are told by St Athanasius (De Decr. Nic. Synodi, i. 232.) that the work, ''On Principles'', in which it was mostly founded as well as other works by Origen, were very much interpolated by others who wished to secure his name in favour of their opinions."&lt;ref&gt; Gilmartin, T., Manual of Church History, Vol.I, 1890&lt;/ref&gt;...

==Alexandria, now==

"Alexandria, once home to the wonders of the world, continued to fall from grace as each new ruler built less memorable structures in layers over the ancient city.  Much has been lost.  The locations of the ancient ''[[Museion]]'' with its adjacent schools and the Great Library, of the original Church of St. Mark and the Catechetical School, are not known; neither are those of the tomb of Alexander nor of any of the ancient streets described by so many visitors.  Of the two gates of the Sun and the Moon there survives not even a description."&lt;ref&gt; Mojsov, Bojana, Alexandria Lost, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;...

'''Christmas traditions''' vary from country to country. [[Christmas]] celebrations for many nations include the installing and lighting of [[Christmas tree]]s, the hanging of [[Advent wreath]]s, [[Christmas stocking]]s, [[candy cane]]s, and the creation of [[Nativity scene]]s depicting the birth of [[Jesus Christ]]. [[Christmas carol]]s may be sung and stories told about such figures as the [[Baby Jesus]], [[Saint Nicholas|St Nicholas]], [[Santa Claus]], [[Father Christmas]], [[Christkind]] or [[Ded Moroz|Grandfather Frost]]. The sending and exchange of [[Christmas card]] greetings, observance of [[fasting]] and special religious observances such as a midnight [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or [[Vespers]] on [[Christmas Eve]], the burning of a [[Yule log]], and the [[History of Christmas Gift Giving|giving and receiving of presents]]. Along with [[Easter]], Christmas is one of the most important periods on the Christian calendar, and is often closely connected to other holidays at this time of year, such as [[Advent]], the [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]], [[St Nicholas Day]], [[St. Stephen's Day]], [[New Year]]'s, and the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of the Epiphany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Christmas.aspx|title=Christmas|publisher=www.encyclopedia.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ethiopia and Eritrea ====

Christmas Day is a [[Public holidays in Eritrea|public holiday in Eritrea]] that is celebrated on January 7 or on 27 Tahsas of the [[Ethiopian calendar]]. Christmas is called ''Ledet'' (áá°áµ) in Eritrea or ''Gena'' (áá) in Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DbBm2WpVwUkC&amp;pg=PA33 |title= Ethiopia |page= 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people who are Christian in the two countries fast for 40 days (it is called fast of the prophets). They then head to church at dawn on Christmas morning. On Christmas Day, there will be colorful musical celebrations which involve the priests dressed in their best robes performing rituals, including dancing and playing drums and other instruments. Early in the morning at dawn, everyone dresses in white and head to the nearby church. Late in the afternoon there will be the traditional game of Gena, a kind of hockey. According to an Ethiopian legend, the game was being played by the shepherds who were tending their flocks on the night that Jesus was born. The game is attended by the leader of the community. A prize is awarded to the winner of the Gena game. Most Ethiopians don a traditional Shamma, a thin, white cotton wrap with brightly colored stripes across the ends.The holiday is followed up by the three-day festival Timkat starting on January 19 and celebrating the baptism of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/travel/2012/01/06/an_ethiopian_christmas.html|title=An Ethiopian Christmas|work=thestar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoneagetour.com/attractions/festivals-in-ethiopia/leddet-ethiopian-christmas|title=Leddet (Ethiopian Christmas) â Stone Age Ethiopia Tours â  Ethiopia Travel â Holiday in Ethiopia â Tour Package to Ethiopia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nigeria ====

Christmas Day is a [[Public holidays in Nigeria|public holiday in Nigeria]] which is always marked by the emptying of towns and cities as Nigerians that have been successful returning to their ancestral villages to be with family and to bless those less fortunate.&lt;ref name=afokansi1&gt;[[#Afokansi|Afokansi]], introduction paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=afokansi5&gt;[[#Afokansi|Afokansi]], "Visits from not relations and friends"&lt;/ref&gt; As the towns and cities empty, people jam the West African markets to buy and transport live chickens, goats and cows that will be needed for the Christmas meals.&lt;ref name=afokansi2&gt;[[#Afokansi|Afokansi]], "Abundance of food and drinks"&lt;/ref&gt;

On Christmas Eve, traditional meals are prepared according to the traditions of each region. Nigerians as a whole tend to prepare various meats in large quantities.&lt;ref name=afokansi2/&gt; In the south, a dish called [[Jollof rice]] is served with stews of various meats along with boiled beans and fried plantains; in the north, Rice and Stew as well as ''Tuwon Shinkafa'', a rice pudding served with various meat stews, is preferred. In the North several local desserts are also made which is hardly ever found in other parts of Nigeria.&lt;ref name=afokansi2/&gt; An alternative in both regions (but more favored in the south) is a pepper soup with fish, goat, or beef which may also be served with [[Fufu]] (pounded yam).&lt;ref name=afokansi2/&gt; Served with this food are an array of mainly alcoholic drinks such as the traditional [[palm wine]] or various local and imported beers and wines; children and women may be served locally-made soft-drink equivalents instead.&lt;ref name=afokansi2/&gt;

Gift giving in Nigeria often involves money and the flow of gifts from the more fortunate to the less fortunate.&lt;ref name=afokansi6&gt;[[#Afokansi|Afokansi]], "Financial donations"&lt;/ref&gt; After the "successful" visitors have come from their towns, cities, and even overseas, they are given time to settle in. Afterwards, local relatives begin approaching them asking for assistance of some kind, whether financial or not.&lt;ref name=afokansi6/&gt; Financial donations and elaborately wrapped gifts may be given out at lavish parties, weddings, and ceremonies; sometimes the money is scattered in the air to be grabbed by the others or stuck onto the sweaty foreheads of those dancing.&lt;ref name=afokansi6/&gt;

[[Religion in Nigeria]] is about equally divided between Christians and Muslims. There are occasional outbreaks of religious conflict. The Islamic sect [[Boko Haram]] has attacked Christian churches with bombings on Christmas 2011.

==== South Africa ====

Christmas in South Africa is a public holiday celebrated on December 25.&lt;ref name="publicholidays"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.za/aboutsa/holidays.htm |title=Public holidays |publisher=Government Communication and Information Service |accessdate=December 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101165214/http://www.info.gov.za/aboutsa/holidays.htm |archivedate=November 1, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many European traditions are maintained despite the distance from Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capetownmagazine.com/events/public-holidays/Christmas-Day-Public-Holiday/2012-12-25/130_37_2812 |title=Christmas Day (Public Holiday) |work=Cape Town Magazine |accessdate=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christmas trees are set up in homes and the children are given presents in their stockings.&lt;ref name="Christmas in South Africa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/south_africa.shtml|title=Christmas in South Africa|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional 'fir' Christmas trees are popular and children leave a stocking or milk and cookies out for Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. The gift bearer is Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. Towns and cities have [[Carols by Candlelight]] in the beginning of the festive season where groups of people come together to sing Christmas carols and donate toys and clothing to needy children.

The Christmas meal is mince pies, turkey, gammon, beef tongue, turducken, corned beef, green salad,roast beef or a barbecue outdoors. The meal is finished with Christmas Pudding, Ice cream or trifle. [[Christmas crackers]] are used to make noise.&lt;ref name="Christmas in South Africa"/&gt;

Despite Christmas occurring at the height of the Southern Hemisphere summer, wintry motifs common to the Northern Hemisphere are popular.

[[File:HK Sheung Wan Fook Sing Court Parkn Shop Christmas snow.JPG|thumb|upright|Christmas 2012 in China]]

In China, December 25 is not a legal holiday. However, it is still designated as a public holiday in China's special administrative regions of [[Public holidays in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] and [[Public holidays in Macau|Macau]], both former colonies of Western powers with nominal Christian cultural heritage.

In the mainland, the small percentage of Chinese citizens who [[Christianity in China|consider themselves Christians]] unofficially, and usually privately, observe Christmas.&lt;ref name="lovetoknow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christmas.lovetoknow.com/How_Christmas_Started_in_China |title=How Christmas Started in China â LoveToKnow Christmas |publisher=Christmas.lovetoknow.com |date=October 27, 2009 |accessdate=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other individuals celebrate Christmas-like festivities even though they do not consider themselves Christians. Many customs, including sending cards, exchanging gifts, and hanging stockings are very similar to Western celebrations.&lt;ref name="lovetoknow" /&gt; Commercial Christmas decorations, signs, and other symbolic items have become increasingly prevalent during the month of December in large urban centres of mainland China, reflecting a cultural interest in this Western phenomenon, and, sometimes, retail marketing campaigns as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/china.htm|title=Christmas in China|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Hong Kong ======

Christmas trees are found in major malls and other public buildings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.12hk.com/festivals/Christmas/Christmas.shtml |title=Christmas in Hong Kong |publisher=12hk.com |date=November 25, 2011 |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some homes as well, despite the small living area. Catholics in Hong Kong can attend Christmas Mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santas.net/hongkongchristmas.htm |title=Christmas in Hong Kong: Around the World at Santa's Net |publisher=Santas.net |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Macau ======
Christmas is a public holiday in Macau. Its traditions are mostly influenced by the Portuguese since the territory was a colony of Portugal until December 20, 1999. Casinos in Macau remain open on Christmas Day. Christmas masses in Macau's Catholic churches are held in either Chinese or Portuguese.

Encouraged by commerce, the secular celebration of Christmas is popular in Japan, though Christmas is not a national holiday. Gifts are sometimes exchanged.&lt;ref name=AboutJapan/&gt; Christmas parties are held around Christmas Day; Japanese [[Christmas cake]], a white sponge cake covered with cream and decorated with strawberries, is often consumed and Stollen cake, either imported or made locally, is widely available.

The first recorded Christmas in Japan was a Mass held by Jesuit Missionaries in [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]] in 1552. Some believe that unrecorded celebrations were held before this date, starting in 1549 when [[Saint Francis Xavier]] arrived in Japan. Christianity was banned throughout Japan in 1612. However, a small enclave of [[Kakure Kirishitan]] ("hidden Christians") continued to practice underground over the next 250&amp;nbsp;years.

[[Christianity in Japan]] along with Christmas reemerged in the [[Meiji period]]. Influenced by America, Christmas parties were held and presents were exchanged. The practice slowly spread, but its proximity to the [[Japanese New Year|New Year]]'s celebrations makes it a smaller focus of attention. During [[World War II]], all celebrations, especially American, were suppressed. From the 1960s, with an expanding economy, and influenced by American TV, Christmas became popular. Many songs and TV series present Christmas as romantic, for example "[[Last Christmas]]" by [[Exile (Japanese band)|Exile]]. The birthday of the current emperor, [[Akihito]], on December 23 is a national holiday. Businesses soon close for the New Year's holidays, reopening after January 3.

===== South Korea =====

Christmas is a [[Public holidays in South Korea|public holiday]] in South Korea.&lt;!-- I remember that the Santa in blue was a marketing gimmick from some company: According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the Korean version of Santa Claus (''Santa Haraboji'', which means Santa Grandfather) can sometimes wear a blue suit instead of a red suit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/12/24/10-foreign-christmas-traditions-that-americans-might-want-to-adopt/ 10 foreign Christmas traditions that Americans might want to adopt] Rick Noack, The Washington Post, December 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

[[Christianity in Pakistan]] constitutes the second largest religious minority community in Pakistan after Hindus. The total number of Christians is approximately 2,800,000 in 2008, or 1.6% of the population. Of these, approximately half are Roman Catholic and half Protestant. Christians celebrate Christmas by going from house to house singing carols, and in return the family offers something to the choir.&lt;ref name="Christmas in Pakistan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/pakistan.shtml|title=Christmas in Pakistan|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly the money collected from such carols is used for charity works or is given to the church. Their homes are decorated with local Christmas handicrafts while artificial stars signifying the Star of Bethlehem are hung on rooftops. Christmas celebrations are also popular with the urban middle class in the country with hotels, cafes, restaurants and theme parks hosting festivities and special events.&lt;ref name="Christmas in Pakistan"/&gt;

Although Christmas is a [[Public holidays in Malaysia|public holiday in Malaysia]], much of the public celebration is commercial in nature and has no overt religious overtones. Occasionally, Christian activist groups do buy newspaper advertorials on Christmas or Easter but this is largely only allowed in English newspapers and permission is not given every year. The advertorials themselves are usually indirect statements. There has been controversy over whether or not the national government has exerted pressure on Malaysian Christians not to use Christian religious symbols and hymns that specifically mention Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/32072 |title=Rev Lim: Excluding carols with Jesus' name is scandalous |publisher=Malaysiakini.com |accessdate=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christmas in the Philippines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/philippines.shtml|title=Christmas in the Philippines|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of two predominantly Catholic countries in Asia (the other one being [[East Timor]]), is one of the biggest holidays on the calendar and is widely celebrated. The country has earned the distinction of celebrating the world's longest Christmas season, with Christmas carols heard as early as September 1 when the "'''Ber Months'''" season kicks off traditionally. The season is officially ushered in by the nine-day dawn [[Mass (Liturgy)|Mass]]es that start on December 16. Known as the ''[[Misas de Aguinaldo]]'' (Gift Masses) or ''[[Misa de Gallo]]'' (Rooster's Mass) in the traditional Spanish, these Masses are more popularly known in Tagalog as the ''Simbang Gabi'', and are held in Catholic parishes and chapels nationwide. Usually, aside from the already [[Public holidays in the Philippines|legal holidays]] which are [[Rizal Day]] (December 30) and New Year's Eve (December 31), other days in close proximity such as Christmas Eve (December 24), ''NiÃ±os Inocentes'' (December 28), and the Epiphany (traditionally, January 6 but now on the first Sunday of January) are also declared non-working days.&lt;ref name="Christmas in the Philippines"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livinginthephilippines.com/philippine_articles/longest_christmas.html |title=Christmas in the Philippines |publisher= |accessdate=September 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228035950/http://www.livinginthephilippines.com/philippine_articles/longest_christmas.html |archivedate=December 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in many East Asian countries, secular Christmas displays are common both in business establishments and in public, including lights, Christmas trees, depictions of Santa Claus despite the tropical climate, and Christmas greetings in various foreign languages and various [[Philippine languages]]. Occasionally such displays are left in place even in summer for example the ''[[parol]]'' representing the "Star of Bethlehem" which led the Three Kings to the newborn Baby Jesus.&lt;ref name="Christmas in the Philippines"/&gt;

For Filipinos, Christmas Eve (Tagalog: ''Bisperas ng Pasko''; Spanish: ''VÃ­spera del DÃ­a de Navidad'') on December 24 is celebrated with the Midnight Mass, and immediately after, the much-anticipated Noche Buena â the traditional Christmas Eve feast. Family members dine together around 12 midnight on traditional [[Nochebuena]] fare, which may include: ''[[queso de bola]]'' (English: "ball of cheese"; this is actually [[edam cheese]]), ''tsokolate'' (a hot chocolate drink), and ''[[jamÃ³n]]'' (Christmas ham), ''[[lechon|lechÃ³n]]'', roast chicken or turkey, pasta, ''relleno'' (stuffed ''[[Milkfish|bangus]]'' or chicken), ''[[pan de sal]]'', and various desserts including cakes and the ubiquitous fruit salad. Some would also open presents at this time.

On December 31, New Year's Eve (Tagalog: ''Bisperas ng Bagong Taon''; Spanish: ''VÃ­spera del AÃ±o Nuevo''), Filipino families gather for the Media Noche or midnight meal â a feast that is also supposed to symbolize their hopes for a prosperous New Year. In spite of the campaign against firecrackers, many Filipinos still see these as the traditional means to greet [[the New Year]]. The loud noises and sounds of merrymaking are also supposed to drive away bad spirits. Safer methods of merrymaking include banging on pots and pans and blowing on car horns. Folk beliefs also include encouraging children to jump at the stroke of midnight in the belief that they will grow up tall, displaying circular fruit and wearing clothes with dots and other circular designs to symbolize money, eating twelve grapes at 12 midnight for good luck in the twelve months of the year, and opening windows and doors during the first day of the New Year to let in good luck.

Christmas officially ends on the Feast of the Three Kings (''Tres Reyes'' in Spanish or ''Tatlong Hari'' in Tagalog), also known as the [[Feast of the Epiphany]] (Spanish: ''Fiesta de EpifanÃ­a''). The Feast of the Three Kings was traditionally commemorated on January 6 but is now celebrated on the first Sunday after the New Year. Some children leave their shoes out, in the belief that the Three Kings will leave gifts like candy or money inside. But the celebrations do not end there, since 2011, as mandated by the Catholic Church, they are on the second Sunday of January in honor of the Lord Jesus's baptism in the Jordan (the Solemnity of the Lord's Baptism or in Spanish ''Solemnidad de Bautismo del SeÃ±or''). The final salvo of these celebrations is marked by the feast of the [[Black Nazarene]] every January 9 in Manila and Cagayan de Oro, but can also, due to the celebrations in honor of the [[Santo NiÃ±o de CebÃº|Santo NiÃ±o]] in the third and fourth Sundays of January in some places, can even extend till the final weeks of that month.&lt;ref name="Christmas in the Philippines"/&gt;

The famous Singaporean shopping belt [[Orchard Road]], as well as the [[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]] area will feature lights and other decorations from early November till early January (the 2014 part is November 14, 2014 all the way until January 5, 2015). The Christmas light-up and decorated shopping malls along Orchard Road often attract numerous visitors, locals and tourists alike. Other than the light-up, other activities such as caroling, concerts and parades can also be experienced in Orchard Road. In addition, companies in Singapore usually arrange gift exchange programs on the last working day before Christmas.

===== Armenia =====
Armenians usually celebrate Christmas on January 6. The reason for this unusual date emerges from ancient history. "In the fourth century Roman Catholic Church, officials established the date of Christmas as December 25th." &lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Christmas : nearly 200 alphabetically arranged entries covering all aspects of Christmas, including folk customs, religious observances, history, legends, symbols, and related days from Europe, America, and around the world"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gulevich|first1=Tanya|title=Encyclopedia of Christmas : nearly 200 alphabetically arranged entries covering all aspects of Christmas, including folk customs, religious observances, history, legends, symbols, and related days from Europe, America, and around the world|date=2000|publisher=Omnigraphics|location=Detroit|isbn=0780803876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that time, Armenians celebrated Christmas (''surb tsnunt'', ÕÕ¸ÖÖÕ¢ Ô¾Õ¶Õ¸ÖÕ¶Õ¤, meaning "Holy Birth") on January 6&lt;ref&gt;Hratch Tchilingirian. ''Why Armenians Celebrate Christmas on January 6''. Western Diocese, 2008, January 2&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[Public holidays in Armenia|public holiday in Armenia]]. It also coincides with the Epiphany. The Armenians denied the new Roman mandate regarding Christmas, and continued to celebrate both the Nativity and Jesusâ baptism on January 6. When the Gregorian calendar was implemented in 1582, the Armenians rejected the reformed calendar and remained following the Julian Calendar. But today, only Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem still uses the Julian Calendar. Since the Julian calendar is thirteen days ahead of the Gregorian Calendar, when the Armenians of Jerusalem celebrate Christmas on January 6 according to the Julian calendar the Gregorian calendar counts the day as January 19.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Christmas : nearly 200 alphabetically arranged entries covering all aspects of Christmas, including folk customs, religious observances, history, legends, symbols, and related days from Europe, America, and around the world" /&gt;

Traditionally, Armenians fast during the week leading up to Christmas avoiding all meat, eggs, and dairy products.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Christmas : nearly 200 alphabetically arranged entries covering all aspects of Christmas, including folk customs, religious observances, history, legends, symbols, and related days from Europe, America, and around the world" /&gt; Devout Armenians may even refrain from food for the three days leading up to the Christmas Eve, in order to receive the Eucharist on a "pure" stomach. Christmas Eve is particularly rich in traditions. Families gather for the Christmas Eve dinner (''khetum'', Ô½Õ©Õ¸ÖÕ´), which generally consists of: rice, fish, ''nevik'' (Õ¶Õ¸ÖÕ«Õ¯, a vegetable dish of green chard and chick peas), and yogurt/wheat soup (''tanabur'', Õ©Õ¡Õ¶Õ¡ÕºÕ¸ÖÖ). Dessert includes dried fruits and nuts, including ''rojik'', which consists of whole shelled walnuts threaded on a string and encased in grape jelly, ''bastukh'' (a paper-like confection of grape jelly, cornstarch, and flour), etc. This lighter menu is designed to ease the stomach off the week-long fast and prepare it for the rather more substantial Christmas Day dinner. Children take presents of fruits, nuts, and other candies to older relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/armenia.shtml|title=Christmas in Armenia|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "On the eve of the Feast of the Nativity and Theophany of The Lord Jesus Christ, the Jrakalouyts Divine Liturgy (the lighting of the lamps service) is celebrated in honor of the manifestation of Jesus as the Son of God (theophany)" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nativity and Theophany of Our Lord "Overview"|url=http://www.armenianchurch-ed.net/feasts/feastschristmas/about/|website=www.armenianchurch-ed.net|publisher=Armenian Church|accessdate=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Christmas tree (''tonatsar'', ÕÖÕ¶Õ¡Õ®Õ¡Õ¼), Armenians (particularly in the Middle East) also erect the Nativity scene. Christmas in the Armenian tradition is a purely religious affair. Santa Claus does not visit the nice Armenian children on Christmas, but rather on New Year's Eve. The idea of Santa Claus existed before the Soviet Union and he was named '' kaghand papik'' (Ô¿Õ¡Õ²Õ¡Õ¶Õ¤ ÕÕ¡ÕºÕ«Õ¯), but the Soviet Union had a great impact even on Santa Claus. Now he goes by the more secular name of Grandfather Winter (''dzmerr papik'', ÕÕ´Õ¥Õ¼ ÕÕ¡ÕºÕ«Õ¯).

===== Assyrians =====

[[File:Iraqvillagealqosh8.JPG|thumb|Traditional ceremony during an Assyrian Christmas celebration in Alqosh, northern Iraq]]

The [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], the indigenous people of northwestern Iran, northern Iraq, northeastern Syria, and southeastern Turkey that belong to the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Ancient Church of the East]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], and [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] today celebrate Christmas on December 25. Assyrians colloquially call Christmas ''Eda Zora,'' meaning "little holiday." It is officially called ''Eda d'Yalde'' which means "birthday holiday." Traditionally, Assyrians fast (''sawma'') from December 1 until Christmas Day. In Iraq, for instance, on Christmas Eve, Assyrian families congregate outside of their house and hold lighted candles while a child reads aloud the nativity story. Then they all sing psalms over a bonfire made of thorn bushes. Folklore says that if the thorns burn to ashes, the family will have good luck. After the fire has been reduced to ashes, the family members will jump three times over the ashes and make a wish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chaldeannews.com/christmas-traditions/|title=Christmas Traditions|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207065201/http://www.chaldeannews.com/christmas-traditions/|archivedate=December 7, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, on Christmas, "as another bonfire burns in the churchyard, the bishops lead the service while carrying a figure of the baby Jesus. He blesses one person with a touch. That person touches the next person and the touch passes around until all have felt the touch of peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i-4WhilzYkQC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;lpg=PA271&amp;dq=%22chaldean+Christmas%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e4k3E1GgSE&amp;sig=wPnLEzz_jcDjdSvqLgLZVwT4Quw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Js97VMvKAaa1sQTRnoGYAw&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false/|title=Once Upon a Time in Baghdad|author=Margo Kirtikar|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Assyrians will attend the ''Shaharta,'' or midnight vigil before Christmas. On Christmas Day, when families gather together after the ''Shaharta'' or morning mass, ''raza d'mowlada d'maran,'' the fast is broken by eating traditional Assyrian foods such as ''pacha/reesh-aqle'' (meaning "from the head to the tail"), which is a boiled soup made of sheep or cow intestines, tongue, stomach, legs, and spices or ''harissa'', a porridge made of ground wheat and chicken (both dishes are prepared usually overnight). These two dishes are only made twice a year: on Christmas and Easter. Traditional desserts eaten after the main course include Killeche, a date and walnut-stuffed cookie, and Kadeh, another stuffed pastry. After the feast is finished, Assyrians will visit the houses of family and friends to exchange Christmas greetings, saying, "''Eedokhon breekha,''" meaning "May your feast be blessed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/festivals-ix-assyrian/|title=FESTIVALS ix.Assyrian|author=Encyclopedia Iranica|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, the host will serve tea, Turkish coffee, and Killeche and Kadeh to guests. Although Christmas is celebrated in a much more religious fashion, in recent years, families put up a small Christmas tree in the house.

In the Canadian provinces where English is the predominant language, Christmas traditions are largely similar to those of the United States, with some lingering influences from the United Kingdom and newer traditions brought by immigrants from other European countries. [[Mince pie]]s, [[plum pudding]], and [[Christmas cake]] are traditionally served as Christmas dinner desserts, following the traditional meal of roast turkey, stuffing, potatoes, and winter vegetables. [[Christmas cracker|Christmas table crackers]] are not uncommon and, in some parts of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and [[Nova Scotia]], Christmas traditions include [[mummers play|mummers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/travel/39050-mummers-fest-just-part-rocking-yuletide|title=Mummers fest just part of rocking Yuletide|work=The Chronicle Herald|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifeasahuman.com/2010/arts-culture/creativity/mummering-in-nova-scotia/|title=Mummering in Nova Scotia|work=LIFE AS A HUMAN|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North American influences on Christmas are evident in the hanging of stockings on Christmas Eve, to be filled by Santa Claus. However, Canadian children believe that the home of Santa Claus is located at the North Pole, in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2010/12/22/santa-claus-a-canadian-immigration-minister-reaffirms/|title=Santa Claus a Canadian, Immigration Minister Confirms|author=Kenyon Wallace|date=December 22, 2010|work=National Post|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, through [[Canada Post]], address thousands of letters to Santa Claus each year, using the [[Postal codes in Canada|postal code]] designation ''H0H 0H0''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2011/12/03/santa-canada-post-20-million_n_1126273.html|title=Canada Post's Santa Mail Expecting 20&amp;nbsp;Millionth Letter Soon|date=December 3, 2011|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decorated Christmas trees, either fresh cut or artificial, were introduced to Canada in 1781, originally by German soldiers stationed in Quebec during the American Revolution, and are now common in private homes and commercial spaces throughout most of Canada.

As Canada is a cold, dark country in winter, lights are often put up in public places and on commercial and residential buildings in November and December. Many communities have celebrations that include light events, such as the [[Cavalcade of Lights Festival]] in [[Toronto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toronto.ca/special_events/cavalcade_lights/2012/index.htm |title=Special Events Office â Festivals and Events â Living In Toronto |publisher=City of Toronto |date=November 30, 2013 |accessdate=December 14, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312203027/http://www.toronto.ca/special_events/cavalcade_lights/2012/index.htm |archivedate=March 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Montreal]] Christmas Fireworks, or the Bright Nights in [[Stanley Park]], [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vancouver.ca/parks-recreation-culture/bright-nights-train.aspx |title=Bright Nights Christmas Train in Stanley Park |publisher=City of Vancouver |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A national program, Christmas Lights Across Canada, illuminates Ottawa, the national capital, and the 13 provincial and territorial capitals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ottawacitizen.com/2011/11/26/canadian-christmas-region-by-region/ Canadian Christmas Region by Region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129001829/http://blogs.ottawacitizen.com/2011/11/26/canadian-christmas-region-by-region/ |date=November 29, 2011 }}, Ottawa Citizen, November 26, 2011, Retrieved November 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In the province of [[Quebec]], Christmas traditions include ''[[rÃ©veillon]]'', ''[[PÃ¨re NoÃ«l]]'' ("Father Christmas"), and the ''[[bÃ»che de NoÃ«l]]'' ([[Yule log]]), among many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/christmas-in-canadapedia Christmas in Canada], The Canadian Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; A traditional dish for the rÃ©veillon is ''[[tourtiÃ¨re]]'', a savoury meat pie, and gifts are opened during ''rÃ©veillon'', often following Midnight Mass.

The [[Royal Christmas Message]] from the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarch]] is televised nationwide in Canada, the occasion being an observance which unites Canadians with citizens of the other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]] worldwide. The observation of [[Boxing Day]] on the day following Christmas Day is a tradition practiced in Canada, as it is in many other Anglophone countries, although not in the United States. In Canada, Boxing Day is a day (or the beginning of a few days) of deeply discounted sale prices at retail stores which attract large numbers of shoppers in search of bargains.

===== Mexico =====
{{see also|Christmas in Mexico}}

Christmas is a [[Public holidays in Mexico|statutory holiday in Mexico]] and workers can have the day off with pay. Mexico's
Christmas is filled with over 30 traditions found only within Mexican Christmas. Over nine days, groups of townspeople go from door to door in a fashion of when the parents of the unborn baby Jesus Christ looked for shelter to pass the night when they arrived at Bethlehem, and are periodically called inside homes to participate in the breaking of a candy-filled [[piÃ±ata]].

Mexican Christmas festivities start on December 12, with the feast of La Guadalupana ([[Virgin of Guadalupe]]), and end on January 6, with the Epiphany. Since the 1990s, Mexican society has embraced a new concept linking several celebrations around Christmas season into what is known as the [[Guadalupe-Reyes Marathon]]. At midnight on Christmas, many families place the figure of baby Jesus in their ''nacimientos'' ([[Nativity scene]]s), as the symbolic representation of Christmas as a whole. In the center and south of Mexico, children receive gifts on Christmas Eve and on January 6, they celebrate the Feast of the Epiphany, when, according to tradition, the Three Wise Men (3 Wizard Kings) brought gifts to Bethlehem for Jesus Christ. Santa Claus (or Santa Clos, as he's known in Mexico&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santas.net/mexicanchristmas.htm |title=Christmas in Mexico |work=Santas.net |publisher=Australian Media Pty Ltd. |accessdate=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is who brings the children their gifts, but traditionally the Three Wise Men will fill the children's shoes with candies, oranges, tangerines, nuts, and sugar cane, and sometimes money or gold. For the Three Wise Men gave Baby Jesus Gold for his future.

Christmas is a widely celebrated festive holiday in the United States,&lt;ref name="thehistoryofchristmas.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/usa.htm|title=Christmas in the U.S.A.|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Christmas Day is officially recognized as a [[federal holiday]] by the [[US Government]]. The [[Christmas and holiday season]] begins around the end of November with a major shopping kickoff on [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]], the day after the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|U.S. holiday of Thanksgiving]], though Christmas decorations and music playing in stores sometimes extend into the period between [[Halloween]] and Thanksgiving. Many schools and businesses are closed during the period between Christmas and the [[New Year's Day]] holiday, which is a time commonly used to spend time with family and close friends, return unwanted gifts at stores, and shop after-Christmas sales. Most decorations are taken down by New Years or Epiphany. Other observances considered part of the season (and potentially included in non-denominational [[holiday greetings]] like "Happy Holidays") include [[Hanukkah]], [[Yule]], Epiphany, [[Kwanzaa]], and [[winter solstice]] celebrations.

The interior and exterior of houses are decorated during the weeks leading up to Christmas Eve. Christmas tree farms in the [[Christmas tree cultivation in the United States|United States]] and [[Christmas tree production in Canada|Canada]] provide families with trees for their homes, many opting for [[Artificial Christmas tree|artificial ones]], but some for [[Christmas tree|real ones]]. The Christmas tree usually stands centrally in the home, decorated with ornaments, tinsel, and lights, with an angel or a star symbolizing the [[Star of Bethlehem]] at the top.&lt;ref name="thehistoryofchristmas.com"/&gt;

Christmas Eve is popularly described as "[['Twas the Night Before Christmas|the night before Christmas]]" in the poem actually titled "[[A Visit from St. Nicholas]]". Better known as [[Santa Claus]], he is said to visit homes while children are sleeping during the night before Christmas morning. The [[fireplace]]s in many homes have been replaced by [[electric fireplace]]s, but the [[yule log]] has remained a tradition. [[Christmas stockings]] are hung on the [[Fireplace mantel|mantelpiece]] for Santa Claus to fill with little gifts ("stocking stuffers"). It is tradition throughout the United States for children to leave a glass of milk and plate of [[Christmas cookies]] for Santa Claus nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allhomemadecookies.com/articles/christmastraditions.htm |title=Christmas Traditions and Holiday Cookies |author=Hart Dowd |publisher=allhomemadecookies.com |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presents the family will exchange are wrapped and placed near the tree, including presents to be given to pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/business-headlines/ci_16886888?nclick_check=1 |title=A very furry Christmas |publisher=Contracostatimes.com |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friends exchange wrapped presents and tell each other not to open presents before Christmas. Grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, siblings and occasionally guests from out of town are entertained in the home or else visited. Wrapped presents are most commonly opened on the morning of Christmas Day; however, some families choose to open all or some of their presents on Christmas Eve, depending on evolving family traditions, logistics, and the age of the children involved; for example, adults might open their presents on Christmas Eve and minor children on Christmas morning, or everyone might open their gifts on Christmas morning. Others follow the tradition of opening family-exchanged gifts on Christmas Eve night, followed by opening of the presents Santa brought on Christmas morning. Children are normally allowed to play with their new toys and games afterwards.

The traditional Christmas dinner usually features either roasted [[Turkey (food)|turkey]] with [[Stuffed turkey|stuffing]] (sometimes called dressing), [[ham]], or [[roast beef]]. Potatoes, squash, roasted vegetables and [[cranberry sauce]] are served along with [[Soft drink|tonics]] and [[sherry|sherries]]. A variety of sweet [[pastry]] and [[egg nog]] sprinkled with [[cinnamon]] and [[nutmeg]] are served in the United States. Certain dishes such as [[casserole]]s and desserts are prepared with a [[Family cookbooks|family recipe]] (usually kept a secret{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}). Sometimes, families also partake in a religious tradition, such as the consumption of a [[Christmas wafer]] in Christian families of European ancestry. Fruits, nuts, cheeses and chocolates are enjoyed as snacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.californiamall.com/holidaytraditions/traditions-america.htm Holiday Traditions â United States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711142614/http://www.californiamall.com/holidaytraditions/traditions-america.htm |date=July 11, 2006 }}.

Other traditions include a special church service on the Sunday before Christmas and [[Midnight Mass]] on Christmas Eve. Candlelight services are held earlier in the evening for families with children. A re-enactment of the [[Nativity of Jesus]] called a [[Nativity play]] is another tradition.

Christmas-related tourist attractions, such as the [[Rockefeller Center]] Christmas tree and elaborate animated [[department store]] [[Christmas window]]s in [[New York City]] are heavily visited by tourists from all over the world. [[Christmas music]] can be heard in the background. The [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]] is one whose annual carol singing is well-recognized. Christmas [[orchestra|symphony orchestra]] and choral presentation such as [[Handel's Messiah|Handel's ''Messiah'']] and performances of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' ballet are attended. Local radio stations may temporarily switch format to play exclusively Christmas music, some going to an all-Christmas format as early as mid-October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/11304519/1/why-all-christmas-radio-keeps-coming-early.html |title=Why All-Christmas Radio Keeps Coming Early |last=Notte |first=Jason |work=TheStreet.com |date=November 9, 2011 |accessdate=November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few television stations broadcast a [[Yule Log (TV program)|Yule Log]] without interruption for several hours. News broadcasts and talk shows feature Christmas-themed segments, emphasizing fellowship and goodwill among neighbors. Of particular note is the observance of Christmas for military families of soldiers and sailors serving abroad, on both sides of the [[CanadaâUnited States border|CanadaâU.S. border]]. The [[Los Angeles Lakers]] have made it a tradition, since they relocated from [[Minneapolis]] prior to the [[1960-61 NBA season]], to have a home game on Christmas. As of 2015, the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] now schedules five games on Christmas, usually including classic rivalry games as well as a rematch of the previous season's [[NBA Finals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/2015/news/08/12/finals-rematch-on-christmas-highlights-2015-16-nba-schedule/ |title=Finals rematch on Christmas highlights 2015-16 schedule |publisher=NBA.com |date= |accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== El Salvador =====
Christmas for El Salvador still carries a strong meaning that brings families together. Despite the business on the streets and the red, green and white colors flooding the environment, Salvadoran people try to honor what they consider to be the true meaning of Christmas, the birth of Jesus.
In El Salvador children celebrate Christmas by playing with [[firecracker]]s, fountains, such as the small ''volcancitos'' ("little volcanos") and sparklers, ''estrellitas'' ("little stars"). Teenagers and young adults display bigger [[fireworks]] or [[Roman candle (firework)|Roman Candle]]s. Families also have parties in which they dance and eat. 
Santa Claus is known for appearing in TV and print ads, but people ask children if they already wrote a letter to little baby Jesus. Traditional Salvadoran Christmas dishes are sauteed turkey sandwiches in a baguette with lettuce and radishes, [[Salvadoran Tamales]], and sweet bread for dessert. Drinks include [[hot chocolate]], [[pineapple]] juice, Salvadoran [[horchata]], Cherry Salvadoran horchata, and coffee. At 12:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on December 25 everyone gathers around the [[Christmas tree]] and opens their presents.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===== Brazil =====

[[File:Ibira at cnight.jpg|thumb|left|[[SÃ£o Paulo (city)|SÃ£o Paulo]]'s Christmas Tree and water fountains at [[Ibirapuera Park]]]]

Christmas Day on December 25 is a [[Public holidays in Brazil|national holiday in Brazil]]. But because Brazil lies in the Southern Hemisphere, Brazilians celebrate Christmas in the summer. In the small cities in the entire country, as well as in the largest cities, like SÃ£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Recife, Salvador, Fortaleza, Curitiba, Porto Alegre, BrasÃ­lia, Manaus, BelÃ©m, Natal and Belo Horizonte, the celebrations resemble in many ways the traditions in Europe and North America, with the Christmas tree, the exchanging of gifts and Christmas cards, the decoration of houses and buildings with electric lights and the nativity scene. Despite the warm tropical summer weather, some incongruences such as decorations with themes of winter and snow are not uncommon. In some cities like [[Guarapuava]], there are decoration contests, when judges go to houses to look at the decorations, inside or outside of the house, and decide the most beautiful house. Christmas Eve is the most important day. Unlike in the North American and Anglo-Saxon tradition, Christmas takes action mainly near midnight, usually with big family dinners, opening of gifts and the celebration of the "Missa do Galo" (the rooster's mass) in churches throughout the nation.

Many Brazilians decorate their homes with a Christmas Tree, there is no rule, the parents can decorate it by themselves as a surprise to the kids, or they can do it together. In addition to the Christmas tree, many families set up a Nativity scene as the main decoration. Nativity scenes are very popular in Brazil, and can be seen everywhere including churches and popular places around the town. Like many other countries, Christmas dinner in Brazil is normally served late in the evening on Christmas Eve around 10 or 11 p.m. The meal often includes farofa stuffing, assortments of fruit, fried cod, and roast turkey with a dessert called "[[rabanada]]". Along with their meals, Brazilians typically drink champagne, wine, and fruit punch. Typically after they eat, many Brazilians attend a Midnight Mass service or watch the Pope's television broadcast celebration of "Midnight Mass in Rome" with family and friends.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Christmas : nearly 200 alphabetically arranged entries covering all aspects of Christmas, including folk customs, religious observances, history, legends, symbols, and related days from Europe, America, and around the world" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1159225.Encyclopedia_Of_Christmas|title=Encyclopedia_Of_Christmas|publisher=www.goodreads.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Colombia =====

[[File:Christmas2004inMedellÃ­n.JPG|thumb|[[MedellÃ­n River]] during the [[Christmas lights in MedellÃ­n|Lighting of Medellin]]]]

Christmas is a [[Public holidays in Colombia|public holiday in Colombia]] and is primarily a religious celebration. Presents are brought by ''El NiÃ±o Jesus / NiÃ±o Dios'' (Baby Jesus).

While Christmas decorations may be put up as early as the beginning of November, the unofficial start of Colombian Christmas festivities takes place on December 7, [[DÃ­a de las Velitas]], or "Day of the Candles." At night, the streets, sidewalks, balconies, porches, and driveways are decorated with candles and paper lanterns, which illuminate cities and towns in a yellow glow to honor the Immaculate Conception on the following day, December 8. In many cities, and even in small rural towns, neighborhoods get together and decorate their whole neighborhood or street, turning streets into virtual "tunnels of light." Many radio stations and local organizations hold contests for the best display of lights, making the competition for the best light show a serious event. The city of MedellÃ­n has become a popular tourist destination during the holiday season because of its [[Christmas lights in MedellÃ­n|Christmas lights]]. Activities such as musical events and firework displays are planned by cities and held during this time. Individually launched fireworks were a common item during the Christmas season in Colombia, often going on at any time of the day in many cities. However, a recent ban has decreased the individual use of fireworks, and now only cities or towns are able to hold firework displays.

December 16 is the first day of the Christmas [[Novena]], a devotion consisting of prayer said on nine successive days, the last one held on Christmas Eve. The Novena is promoted by the Catholic Church as a staple of Christmas, and is very similar to the [[Las Posadas|posadas]] celebrated in Mexico. It is a call for an understanding of the religious meaning of Christmas, and a way to counter the commercialism of the Christmas season. Individual traditions concerning the Novena may vary, but most families set up a "pesebre" (manger scene), sing religious Christmas carols called [[villancicos]] accompanied by tambourines, bells, and other simple percussion instruments, and read verses from the Bible as well as an interpretation which may change from year to year. Novenas serve as beautiful religious gatherings as well as learning environments for young children since kids have a central and active role in the celebration of the Novenas (they read prayers, sing, and play instruments guided by their family). From December 16 to 24, games called "aguinaldos"&lt;ref name="aguinaldos-colombia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colombiaaprende.edu.co/html/home/1592/article-178186.html|title=Colombia Aprende â A jugar aguinaldos|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; are played after having made a "pinky promise" deciding the prize for the winner and the punishment for the loser. The games include "Hablar y no contestar" (Talk but don't answer), "DÃ© pero no reciben" (Give but don't receive), "Pajita en boca" (Straw in the mouth), "Tres pies" (Three feet), "Beso robado" (Stolen kisses), and "Si y al no" (Yes or no). Churches offer dawn and nightly masses during the nine days of the novena, culminating with the [[Misa de Gallo]] (Rooster's Mass) on Christmas Eve at midnight.

Christmas Eve is the most important day of Christmas in Colombia. Families and friends get together to pray the last Novena and wait until midnight to open the presents, parties are held until sunrise on [[Christmas Day]], kids stay up late playing with their new presents, and fireworks fill the skies. Families gather around meals, music, and singing. Because Christmas Eve is the most important day, little occurs on December 25. Families join Christmas Day mass although it is not nearly as festive as Christmas Eve.

The "Dia de los Santos Inocentes", or the [[Day of the Innocents]], falls in the Christmas season, on December 28. The day commemorates the innocent infants (called the innocent ones) who were said to have been killed by [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] in fear of the power of the newborn baby, Jesus. January 6, the day of the Revelation of the Magi (Epiphany), is called "Reyes Magos" (from [[The Three Magi]]), used to be a day of gift giving, but is celebrated less now since gifts are given mostly around Christmas Eve today. Some families still give presents, and it is also the day when godparents give Christmas presents.

===== Venezuela =====

[[File:Paradura del niÃ±o, Baruta.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Different moments of [[Paradura del NiÃ±o]], Venezuelan tradition celebrated on February 2]]

In Venezuela, Christmas is celebrated as a religious occasion. As in Colombia, the presents are brought by "El NiÃ±o Jesus" (Baby Jesus) instead of "PapÃ¡ NoÃ©l" (Santa Claus), that still has an important role during this season.

The unofficial start of the Christmas festivities is after the celebrations of "[[Our Lady of the Rosary of ChiquinquirÃ¡#Annual Celebration|Feria de la Chinita]]", the second half of November. The origin of this festival is the cult to Virgin Mary of [[ChiquinquirÃ¡]], when various religious activities, processions, and music in the typical "[[Gaita (music style)|Gaita style]]" to honor "La [[Chinita]]" (nickname of this Virgin). This event takes place in the Zulia Region, specifically in Maracaibo (the regional capital). After this, other cities join in the festivities and many activities take place including musical events and firework displays.

In many cities, small rural towns and neighborhoods get together for the "patinatas" night festivals where children go and play with skateboards, roller blades and bicycles. These events are usually sponsored by the local church, where neighbors organize themselves and sell typical Christmas food, hot chocolate, [[hallaca]], cookies, etc. Also still in some neighborhoods there is the "[[Parranda]]" where people go from one house to house with music and Christmas songs. The singers stops at neighbors' houses to get some food and drinks. Also in the Venezuelan Andes there is the same tradition of this kind of event but they carry an image of "baby Jesus" and this is called "[[Paradura del NiÃ±o]]." Children write request letters to Baby Jesus. The presents are sent by Baby Jesus at midnight, and most people have a party, which goes on until sunrise.

==== Caribbean ====

===== Bahamas =====
[[Junkanoo]] festivals are held from Christmas Day morning until sunrise on December 27 after Boxing Day and held again on New Year's Day. It is a carnival featuring parading bands in colorful costumes, singing, dancing, and decorations.

Bahamian Christmas foods include black cake, imported apples, pepper pot, pickled onions and ham. Drinks like ginger-beer, sorrel, mauby, and sweet potato fly are served on Christmas.

===== Cuba =====
Cuba had a long tradition of celebrating Christmas. Families used to gather at the dining table, and used to go to mass after dinner.
The Communist Regime led by Fidel Castro abolished the paid Christmas holiday in 1969, citing that workers were needed to continue the sugar harvest. In 1998, the Regime declared December 25 a leisure day, as requested by Pope John Paul II as a condition to visit the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/cuba-ends-its-30year-ban-on-christmas-1193525.html|title=Cuba ends its 30-year ban on Christmas|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a one-day public holiday and it is celebrated only in the evening.

===== Jamaica =====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
Radio stations play Christmas carols as early as October, reggae style and some international. Jamaicans paint their houses and hang new curtains for Christmas. Pepper lights, the local name for Christmas lights, go up even on trees.

[[Junkanoo]] or John Canoe is a traditional Christmas celebration in Jamaica, influenced by African ancestors. This includes street dancing and a great parade through the streets with Jamaicans dressed in colorful masquerade costumes in which masks are worn.

The traditional Jamaican Christmas meal includes [[ackee]], saltfish, breadfruit, fried plantains, boiled bananas, freshly squeezed fruit juice and tea for breakfast; chicken, [[curried goat]], stewed oxtail, rice and [[gungo peas]] for dinner. For dessert, [[sorrel drink]] and a Jamaican rum fruitcake along with red wine are served in many homes.

Many people attend church for Christmas Eve or Christmas morning worship service.

Sometimes on Christmas Eve people or children to go the Grand Market where you walk with family and friends and buy whatever you want and you go home 2:00 or 3:00&amp;nbsp;am Christmas Day.

Some British Christmas traditions have stayed in Jamaica, like Father Christmas, roast beef or lamb dinners, Boxing Day, etc.

=== Europe ===

==== Central Europe ====
{{refimprove|date=December 2013}}

[[File:Adventskranz von oben.jpg|thumb|Christmas wreath]]

In countries of Central Europe (for this purpose, roughly defined as the German-speaking countries of Germany, Austria and Switzerland as well as the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary and possibly other places) the main celebration date for the general public is Christmas Eve (December 24). The day is usually a fasting day; in some places children are told they'll see a ''golden pig'' if they hold fast until after dinner. When the evening comes preparation of Christmas Dinner starts. Traditions concerning dinner vary from region to region, for example, in Poland, Czech Republic, and Slovakia, the prevailing meal is fried [[carp]] with potato salad and fish (or cabbage) soup. However, in some places the tradition is porridge with mushrooms (a modest dish), and elsewhere the dinner is exceptionally rich, with up to 12 dishes. This in fact reveals that when Christmas comes around all the kids get presents from neighbours and house guest. Even the house pet got a little something to gnaw on.

After the dinner comes the time for gifts. Children usually find their gifts under the Christmas Tree, with name stickers. An interesting example of complicated history of the region is the "fight" between Christmas beings. During communism, when countries of Central Europe were under Soviet influence, communist authorities strongly pushed Russian traditional ''Ded Moroz'' ("Grandfather Frost") in the place of Little Jesus won. Now [[Santa Claus]] is attacking, by means of advertising and Hollywood film production. Many people, Christians as well as people with just a Christian background, go to [[Roman Catholic]] midnight mass celebration.

Other common attributes of Christmas in Central Europe include Christmas trees, mistletoe, Christmas garlands, and Bethlehem cribs.

In many areas of Central Europe, St. Nicholas (Hungarian: MikulÃ¡s, Czech: MikulÃ¡Å¡, Polish: MikoÅaj, Slovak: MikulÃ¡Å¡, Slovene: MiklavÅ¾), or Santa Claus, does not come for Christmas. He visits families earlier, on the dawn of St. Nicholas Day on December 6, and for the well-behaved children he has presents and candy-bags to put into their well polished shoes that were set in the windows the previous evening. Although he neither parks his sleigh on rooftops nor climbs chimneys, his visits are usually accompanied by a diabolic-looking servant named Krampusz (in Austria, Slovenia, and Croatia: Krampus, in Czech and Slovak regions he is simply "Äert", i.e. devil, without any name) who gives golden coloured birches for so called badly behaved children. Actually all children get both gifts and golden birches (Hungarian: ''virgÃ¡cs'') in their shoes, no matter how they behaved themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jcu.edu/language/hunghemu/hunghe7g.htm |title=Hungarian Heritage Museum |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815122913/http://www.jcu.edu/language/hunghemu/hunghe7g.htm |archivedate=August 15, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some German-speaking communities, in the  German-speaking Europe; particularly in Catholic regions of western and southern Germany, Switzerland, Austria, South Tyrol and Liechtenstein, as well as in other Catholic regions of Central Europe, the ''[[Christkind]]'' (literally "Christ child") brings the presents on the evening of December 24 (Holy Evening or Heiliger Abend).&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;Forbes, Bruce David, Christmas: a candid history, University of California Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-520-25104-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|68â79}} The Christkind is invisible; thus he is never seen by anyone. However, he rings a bell just before he leaves in order to let children know that the Christmas tree and the presents are ready.

It is a tradition to lavishly decorate a Christmas tree in the days directly before Christmas or on the morning of Christmas Eve. On late Christmas Eve, after the bell rings, the tree is shown to the children and presents are exchanged.

In [[Protestant church]]es, there is a service in the late afternoon intended to immediately precede the [[Christmas Eve]] meal and the exchanging of gifts. This service, called ''Christvesper'', consists most often of scriptural readings, the Christmas Gospel from Luke 2, a ''Krippenspiel'' (nativity play), favourite Christmas carols and festive music for organ and choirs. In some regions the tradition of ''[[Quempas]] singing'' is still popular. Some Lutheran churches also celebrate a candlelight service at midnight besides the Christmas Vespers in the afternoon or early evening.

Many Catholic churches also have a first Mass of Christmas, called ''Christmette'', on "Heiliger Abend" about 4&amp;nbsp;p.m. for the children and parents to attend before the families return home for their meal. The crib is a very important part of the celebrations in Catholic areas especially [[Bavaria]].

====== Austria ======

[[File:Wien Rathaus Christkindlmarkt Dez2006B.jpg|thumb|left|Christmas market in front of the town hall in [[Vienna]], Austria]]

In the largely Catholic Austria, [[Christmas markets]] are a long-standing tradition. In [[Vienna]], for instance, the market is held in the large square in front of City Hall. [[Innsbruck]] opens its romantic Christmas market in the narrow medieval square at the foot of the Golden Roof. In [[Salzburg]], the Christmas market takes over the square in front of the Cathedral with its picturesque stalls, while the tree vendors occupy Residenzplatz on the side of the huge Cathedral. However almost every small town has its own Christmas market.

In Austria, Christmas trees play a very important part of Christmas celebrations. Every town sets up its own huge tree on the main square all decorated with candles, ornaments and candies and frequently there will be an extra one, adorned with bread crumbs, for the birds. In families the tree is decorated with gold and silver ornaments or stars made out of straw, sweets and candy wrapped in tinfoil, gilded nuts, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austria.info/us/people-and-traditions/christmas-season-in-austria-1084204.html|title=Christmas Season in Austria|work=austria.info|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feast of [[St Nicholas]] marks the beginning of Christmas in Austria. On Christmas Eve (December 24) the tree is lit for the first time and the whole family gathers to sing [[Christmas carols]] like "Silent Night, Holy Night".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/austria.shtml|title=Christmas in Austria|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gifts that are placed under the tree are opened after dinner on Christmas Eve. Austrian Christmas tradition has it that it is the Christ Child himself who decorates the Christmas tree on [[Christmas Eve]] and brings the children their Christmas presents, and it is to him that their letters and wish lists are addressed in the weeks before Christmas. The Christmas Eve dinner is the main event of the night often served with fried carp. The famous [[sachertorte]] and different kinds of chocolates are served as dessert. The Austrians also have special crescent shaped cookies served during Christmas time.

In Germany Christmas traditions vary by region. Till the reformation [[Saint Nicholas Day#St. Nicholas Day|Saint Nicholas' Day]], December 6, Saint Nicholas was the main provider of Christmas presents. Nikolaus still puts goodies in children's shoes on that day. Sometimes St. Nicholas visits children in kindergarten, schools or at public events. They have to recite a short poem or sing a song in order to get sweets or a small gift. "[[Knecht Ruprecht]]" (the servant Ruprecht) â dressed in dark clothes with devil-like traits (usually noted as a long, bright red tongue and with a stick or a small whip in the hand) â sometimes accompanies St. Nicholas. His duty is to punish those children who haven't behaved during the year. Usually he doesn't have much to do. He merely stands near St. Nicholas as a warning to be good and polite. Nikolaus  as well for some GlÃ¼hwein for adults, there are some traditions connected with local firefighters, riders associations and church congregations.

The [[Sorbs]], a minority in Saxony and parts of Brandenbuerg with a language similar to Polish, have some specific traditions. E.g. in [[JÃ¤nschwalde]], the ''Bescherkind'' [[JanÅ¡ojski bog]] ("presents kid") is visiting the neighbors, a girl dressed in local costume and veil and goes around with two companions at the Wednesday before Christmas. It provides smaller presents like sweets, similar to the Nikolaus and provides blessings, stays however silent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bern.diplo.de/Vertretung/bern/de/12_20Adventskalender/17-_20sorbische_20Weihnachtsbraeuche.html|title=Deutsche Botschaft Bern|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another tradition in Saxony is related to the [[Wooden toymaking in the Ore Mountains]], especially [[Seiffen]] provides Christmas related decorations like [[Christmas pyramid]] and toys around the year. [[Letters to Santa|Christmas letters]] may be addressed e.g. to [[Engelskirchen]] (Angel's church) or [[Himmelpforten]] (Heaven's gate) or some other in municipalities with matching names. After privatization, [[Deutsche Post]] kept the tradition of dedicated Christmas offices, one in each state, answering letters and requests from children.

Currently the actual Christmas gift-giving (German: "Bescherung") usually takes place on [[Christmas Eve]]. This tradition was introduced by [[Protestant Reformation|Reformator]], [[Martin Luther]], as he as of the opinion that one should put the emphasis on Christ's birth and not on a saint's day and do away with the connotation that gifts have to be earned by good behavior. The gifts should be seen as a symbol for the gift of God's grace in Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst, Eugen: Weihnachten im Wandel der Zeiten, Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 2. Aufl. Darmstadt 2000, pp. 34 â 35&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition quickly became common in predominantly Catholic regions as well.

Gifts may be brought by the ''Weihnachtsmann'' (translation, "Christmas man"), who resembles either St. Nicholas or the [[American Santa Claus]], or by ''[[Christkind]]l'', a sprite-like child who may or may not represent the baby Jesus.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;{{rp|68â79}} Till 1930, there was sort of south north divide between the realms of southern and silesian Christkind and Nordic Weihnachtsmann. After the gifts are opened the children often stay up as late as they like, often till the early hours of the morning.

The Christmas Tree is first put up and decorated on the morning of the 24th. The gifts are then placed under the tree. Christmas services in the church serve as well to exchange greetings with neighbors and friends. After an evening meal one of the parents usually goes into the room where the tree is standing, lights the candles and rings a little bell. Then the children are allowed to go into the candlelit room. In many families it is still a custom to sing Christmas songs around the tree before opening up the presents. Some families attend a midnight church service "Christmette" after the evening meal and gift-giving.

The culinary feast either takes place at supper on Christmas Eve or on the first day of Christmas. Traditions vary from region to region; carp is eaten in many parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://german.about.com/library/blcmasvoc.htm |title=German Christmas Vocabulary |publisher=German.about.com |date=June 22, 2010 |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potato salad with frankfurter or wiener-sausages is popular in some families. Another simple meal which some families favor, especially in regions where Christmas Eve still has the character of a [[fast day]], is vegetable or pea soup. In some regions, especially in [[Schleswig-Holstein]] where Danish influence is noticeable, a roasted duck or goose filled with plums, apples and raisins is family tradition. In other regions, especially in [[Mecklenburg]] and [[Pomerania]], many families prefer [[kale]] with boiled potatoes, special sausages and ham. Many families have developed new traditions for themselves and eat such meals as meat [[fondue]] or [[raclette]]. In almost all families in all parts of Germany you find a wide variety of Christmas cookies baked according to recipes typical for the family and the region.

"LÃ¼ttenweihnachten" describes the hunting and forestry custom of providing a Christmas tree with food decorated for animals.

===== Czech Republic and Slovakia =====

[[File:Christmas in Prague's Old Town Square.jpg|thumb|left|[[Old Town Square]] in Prague, Czech Republic â Christmastime]]

{{Main article|Czech Christmas Mass}}

Christmas Eve (December 24) is celebrated as ''Å tÄdrÃ½ den/Å tedrÃ½ deÅ'', which means "Generous Day", when the gifts are given in the evening. The December 25 and 26 are [[Public holidays in the Czech Republic]] and [[Public holidays in Slovakia|in Slovakia]], but ''VÃ¡noce/Vianoce'' (Christmas), is most commonly associated with the 24th.

According to tradition, gifts are brought by ''JeÅ¾Ã­Å¡ek/JeÅ¾iÅ¡ko'', or "baby Jesus". Fish soup and breaded roasted carp with special homemade potato salad are a traditional dish for the dinner. In Slovakia, before eating, everyone exchanges Christmas greetings with each other by sharing a piece of Christmas wafer (OblÃ¡tky) with honey and walnuts. Traditional dinner depends on region, but common Christmas dinner is cabbage soup (Kapustnica) or lentil soup and breaded roasted carp with special homemade potato salad or hand made gnocchi with poppy (Å¡ÃºÄ¾anky s makom). The gifts are surreptitiously placed under the Christmas tree (usually a [[spruce]] or [[pine]] and lately fir), usually just before or during dinner. Children have to wait for the ringing of a Christmas bell (one of the decorations on the Christmas tree) â the sign that ''JeÅ¾Ã­Å¡ek/JeÅ¾iÅ¡ko'' (little Jesus) has just passed by â to run for the presents. That happens at the end of their Christmas dinner. There is a rich tradition of hard baked Christmas sweets (''CukrovÃ­/vianoÄnÃ© kolÃ¡Äe'').

Other Czech and Slovak Christmas traditions involve predictions for the future. Apples are always cut crosswise: if a perfect star appears in the core, the next year will be successful, distorted star means a bad year or illness, while a cross may suggest death. Girls throw shoes over their shoulders â if the toe points to the door, the girl will get married soon. Another tradition requires pouring some molten lead into water and guessing a message from its shapes.

In Catholic Slovakia, the tradition of [[JasliÄkÃ¡ri]] involves young men dressed as shepherds or angels visiting their neighbors and presenting recitations and songs about the story of the birth of Jesus.&lt;ref name="Ball2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Ann|title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tjI9YQBFDGYC&amp;pg=PA271|accessdate=November 20, 2015|year=2003|publisher=Our Sunday Visitor Publishing|isbn=9780879739102|pages=271â}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Hungary =====
{{Main article|Christmas in Hungary}}
The Christmas and gift-giving season starts relatively early compared to other cultures, with the Santa-like figure, or Hungarian version of Saint Nicholas, [[MikulÃ¡s|MikulÃ¡s (or Szent MiklÃ³s)]] traditionally visiting the homes of Hungarian children on the night of December 5, on the eve of Saint Nicholas Feast Day, December 6.

Although the role of gift-giver on Christmas Day itself is assigned to the Christ Child, on the night before St. Nicholas Day Hungarian children traditionally place a boot on their windowsill waiting for MikulÃ¡s to come by and fill it with treats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stnicholascenter.org/pages/hungary/ |title=St. Nicholas Around the World: Hungary |accessdate=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hungary, celebrations begin with Christmas tree decoration and gift packaging during daytime on December 24, then comes a family dinner with traditional Christmas meals. In some parts of Hungary, a traditional supper called [[fish soup]] ''halÃ¡szlÃ©'' is served at Christmas Eve meal, although it is also consumed at other times of the year. The day is otherwise a fast-day.

[[File:Budapest-Baumkuchen 6361.jpg|thumb|left|[[KÃ¼rtÅskalÃ¡cs]] in Budapest]]

In the evening (Christmas Eve, in Hungarian: Szenteste) the Angel or the Little (Baby) Jesus (Hungarian: KisjÃ©zus or JÃ©zuska) delivers the presents. This is the most intimate moment of Christmas, featuring warmly lit Christmas tree and candles, soft Christmas music, family singing of Christmas or religious songs and gift pack openings. There is also a popular folk custom during December and especially on Christmas Eve, in which children or adults present the birth of Jesus. The custom is called 'playing Bethlehem' (Hungarian: BetlehemezÃ©s), and it is an acting performance, where the 'actors' are wearing costumes, and telling stories about the three kings, the shepherds, Mary, Joseph and of course the birth of the Holy Child. A Christmas crib and a church are used as the scene. The actors go from house to house, and they receive gifts for their performance.

In the largely Roman Catholic Poland, Christmas Eve begins with a day of fasting and then a night of feasting. The traditional Christmas meal is known as [[Wigilia]] ("The [[Vigil]]"), and being invited to attend a Wigilia dinner with a family is considered a high honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/poland.htm |title=Christmas traditions in Poland |publisher=Thehistoryofchristmas.com |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the night of Christmas Eve, the appearance of the first star in the sky is watched for, in remembrance of the [[Star of Bethlehem]], that it has been given an affectionate name of "the little star" or Gwiazdka (the female counterpart of St. Nicholas). On that evening, children watch the sky anxiously hoping to be the first to cry out, "The star has come!" After the first star appearance is declared, the family members sit down to a dinner table.&lt;ref name="pmkamsterdam" /&gt;

According to tradition, bits of hay are spread beneath the tablecloth as a reminder that Christ was born in a [[manger]]. Others partake in the practice of placing money under the table cloth for each guest, in order to wish for prosperity in the coming year. The dinner contains twelve dishes, one for each Apostle. In many homes, an extra place setting is set. The empty setting is symbolically left at the table for a lonely wanderer who may be in need of food, an angel, the [[Baby Jesus]] or the Holy Spirit should appear to share the feast.

Before eating, everyone exchanges Christmas greetings with each other. The supper begins with the breaking of the [[opÅatek]]. By sharing a piece of [[Christmas wafer]] (''OpÅatki''), when everyone at the table breaks off a piece and eats it as a symbol of their unity with Christ. The opÅatek is usually blessed by the presiding Bishop, and stamped with a religious image, such as the nativity scene, they then share a piece with each family member. A tradition exists among some families to serve twelve different dishes at Wigilia symbolizing the [[Twelve Apostles]], or perhaps, an odd number of dishes for good luck (usually five, seven, or nine). Some practice the superstition that an even number of people must be seated around the table.

A traditional Wigilia supper in Poland includes fried [[carp]] and [[barszcz]] (beetroot soup) with [[uszka]] (translated as "little ears", also known as meatless ravioli). The most common dishes are fish soup, with potato salad, [[pierogi]], [[goÅÄbki]] filled with [[kasza]], pickled [[herring]] and fruit [[kompot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/poland.shtml |title=Christmas in Poland |accessdate=December 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Carp provides a main component of the Christmas Eve meal across Poland; [[carp]] fillet, carp in [[aspic]] etc. Universal Polish Christmas foods are [[pierogi]] as well as some [[herring]] dishes, herring fillets, herring in [[aspic]] and for dessert, [[makowiec (pastry)|makowiec]] or noodles with poppy seed. Often, there is a [[compote]] of dry fruits for a drink. etc. Dishes beside fish are usually [[cabbage]]-, forest mushroom- (like [[boletus]]) and [[poppyseed]]-based, with herring being very important. After supper the Star Man arrives attended by the Star Boys. They are dressed as Wise Men or animals or other figures. The Star Man examines the children in their catechism and rewards them with small presents if they do well, even if they need a bit of coaching. The Star Boys sing carols and are given a treat for their help. The feast begins with the appearance of the first star. The meal is followed by the exchange of gifts.
The remainder of the evening is given to stories and songs around the Christmas tree. In some areas of the country, children are taught that "The Little Star" brings the gifts. As presents are unwrapped, carollers may walk from house to house receiving treats along the way.

Christmas Eve ends with [[Pasterka]], the Midnight Mass at the local church. The tradition commemorates the arrival of the [[Three Wise Men]] to Bethlehem and their paying of respect and bearing witness to the new born Messiah. The custom of Christmas night liturgy was introduced in the Christian churches after the second half of the 5th century. In Poland that custom arrived together with the coming of Christianity.&lt;ref name="pmkamsterdam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmkamsterdam.nl/PL/Czytelnia/BozeNar.htm |title=BoÅ¼e Narodzenie i polskie tradycje, |publisher= |accessdate=September 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107101742/http://www.pmkamsterdam.nl/PL/Czytelnia/BozeNar.htm |archivedate=January 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day (December 25) begins with the early morning mass followed by daytime masses. According to scripture, the Christmas Day masses are interchangeable allowing for greater flexibility in choosing the religious services by individual parishioners.&lt;ref name="KÄdzierski"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.przewodnik-katolicki.pl/nr/ksiadz_odpowiada/pasterka_przed_polnoca.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227000853/http://www.przewodnik-katolicki.pl/nr/ksiadz_odpowiada/pasterka_przed_polnoca.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 27, 2012 |title=Pasterka przed pÃ³ÅnocÄ...

The following day is often spent visiting friends.

The giftbearer varies. In some regions it is ÅwiÄty MikoÅaj (Saint Nicholas), in others ÅwiÄty MikoÅaj gives his gifts on December 6 and the giftbringer of the Christmas Eve is Gwiazdor ("star man"), AnioÅek ("little angel") or DzieciÄtko ("baby Jesus").

===== Romania and Moldova =====
{{main article|Christmas in Romania}}

[[File:Sibiu Christmas Market opening 2008.JPG|thumb|right|Christmas market in Sibiu, Romania]]

Christmas (Romanian: ''CrÄciun'') in Romania is on December 25 and is generally considered the second most important religious [[Public holidays in Romania|Romanian holiday]] after Easter.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} In Moldova, although Christmas is celebrated on December 25 like in Romania, January 7 is also recognized as an [[Public holidays in Moldova|official holiday]]. Celebrations begin with the decoration of the Christmas tree during daytime on December 24, and in the evening (Christmas Eve, in Romanian: Ajunul CrÄciunului) ''MoÅ CrÄciun'' (Father Christmas) delivers the presents.

The singing of carols is a very important part of Romanian Christmas festivities. On the first day of Christmas, many carolers walk through the streets of the towns and villages, holding a star made of cardboard and paper on which are depicted various scenes from the Bible. Romanian tradition has the smallest children going from house to house, singing carols and reciting poems and legends during the whole Christmas season. The leader of the group carries with him a star made of wood, covered with metal foil and decorated with bells and coloured ribbons. An image of the Nativity is painted on the star's centre, and this piece of handiwork is attached to the end of a broom or other long stick.

Romanian food served during the holidays is a hearty multi-coursed meal, most of which consists of pork (organs, muscle, and fat). This is mainly a symbolic gesture for [[Ignatius of Antioch|St. Ignatius of Antioch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro}} [http://jurnalul.ro/campaniile-jurnalul/recurs-la-romania/ignat-sarbatoare-insangerata-112680.html Ignat, sÄrbÄtoare insÄngeratÄ], December 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Eastern Europe ====

Since the 1880s, the Christmas customs of the [[East Slavs|Eastern Slavic]] countries have included a similar character known as ''[[Ded Moroz]]'' ("Grandfather Frost"). According to legend, he travels in a magical ''sanki'' â a decorated [[sleigh]] drawn by reindeer (or three white horses). With his young, blond assistant ''[[Snegurochka]]'' (the "Snow Maiden", said to be his granddaughter) at his side, he visits homes and gives gifts to good children (not true for former Yugoslavian countries). He only delivers presents to children while they are asleep, and unlike Santa, he does not travel down chimneys, coming instead to the front door of children's homes. It is traditional for children to leave food for Ded Moroz.

This Ded Moroz (in Russia, ''Ded Moroz'') is not identified nor in any way associated with [[Saint Nicholas of Myra]] ([[feast day]], December 6), who is very widely revered in Eastern Europe for his clerical and charitable works as a bishop. In all likelihood, Ded Moroz is actually in Slavic tradition like Santa Claus, any connection to the original saint having long since disappeared.

===== Georgia =====

[[File:Alilo 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Children at the Alilo march in the streets of [[Tbilisi]]]]

On [[Public holidays in Georgia|calendars in Georgia]], Christmas ({{lang-ka|á¨ááá}}, ''shoba'') is celebrated on January 7 (December 25 on the Julian calendar). It is traditional in Georgia to go on [[Alilo]] (a modified pronunciation of Alleluia), a mass walk in the streets, dressed in special clothing to celebrate and congratulate each other. Most members of the Alilo march are children and they are given sweets by the adults. The Alilo carols vary across the [[mkhare|provinces]] of Georgia. In most songs these words are used: "ááªááá®á£áá¡á áááááááá á¡á, á¥á áá¡á¢á áá¨áá ááááááá¡áá'" (''otsdakhutsa dekembersa qriste ishva betlemsao'') â "on 25th December Christ was born in Bethlehem". A local variant of the Christmas tree, called [[Chichilaki]], is made of soft wooden material with curled branches. Sometimes it is hazelnut branch which is carved into a [[Tree of Life (Judeo-Christian)|Tree of Life]]-like shape and decorated with fruits and sweets. The Western custom of a Christmas tree (''nadzvis khe'') is also popular and has been imported through Russia. The Georgian equivalent of "Santa Claus" is known as ''tovlis papa'' (or ''tovlis babua'' in western [[Georgian dialects]]), literally meaning a "Grandfather snow", and is traditionally portrayed with long white beard, dressed in national costume "[[chokha]]" and wearing a fur cloak "nabadi".

===== Russia =====
{{Main article|Christmas in Russia}}

[[File:Place pres de la gare Moscou.jpg|thumb|New Year decorations in [[Nizhny Novgorod]]]]

As in some other Eastern Orthodox countries, and due to the 13-day difference between the newer Gregorian, and older Julian Calendars, Christmas is celebrated on January 7. Unlike its Western counterparts, Christmas is mainly a religious event in Russia. On Christmas Eve (January 6), there are several long services, including the [[Royal Hours]] and Vespers combined with the [[Divine Liturgy]]. The family will then return home for the traditional Christmas Eve "[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Holy Supper]]", which consists of 12 dishes, one to honor each of the Twelve Apostles. Devout families will then return to church for the "Ð²ÑÐµÐ½Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð°Ñ" [[All Night Vigil]]. Then again, on Christmas Morning, for the "Ð·Ð°ÑÑÑÐµÐ½Ð½ÑÑ" Divine Liturgy of the Nativity. Since 1992 Christmas has become a [[Public holidays in Russia|national holiday in Russia]], as part of the ten-day holiday at the start of every new year.

During the Soviet period, religious celebrations were discouraged by the officially atheist state. Christmas tree and related celebrations were gradually eradicated after the [[October Revolution]]. In 1935, in a surprising turn of state politics, the Christmas tradition was adopted as part of the secular [[New Year's Eve#Russia|New Year]] celebration. These include the decoration of a tree, or "ÑÐ»ÐºÐ°" (spruce), festive decorations and family gatherings, the visit by gift-giving "Ded Moroz" (ÐÐµÐ´ ÐÐ¾ÑÐ¾Ð· "[[Grandfather Frost]]") and his granddaughter, "Snegurochka" (Ð¡Ð½ÐµÐ³ÑÑÐ¾ÑÐºÐ° "[[The Snowmaiden]]"). Many of these were brought to Russia by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] after his Western travels in the late 17th century. {{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

[[File:Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper.jpg|thumb|right|Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper, [[Ukraine]]]]

''[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Sviata Vecheria]]'' or "Holy Supper" is the central tradition of the Christmas Eve celebrations in Ukrainian homes and takes place in most parts of the country on January 6. In Western Ukraine, especially in [[Carpathian Ruthenia]], due to historical multi-culturism, Christmas can be observed twiceâon December 25 and January 7, often irrespective of whether the family belongs to [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], the (Roman) Catholic Church, one of the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (disambiguation)|Ukrainian Orthodox Churches]], or one of the Protestant denominations. The Western Ukrainian tradition of two Christmas celebrations, since 2017, are also celebrated nationwide as well. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.digitaljournal.com/news/world/ukraine-seeks-distance-from-moscow-with-new-christmas-holiday/article/507753|title=Ukraine seeks distance from Moscow with new Christmas holiday|website=m.digitaljournal.com|access-date=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} {{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/news-42008437|title=Ð Ð°Ð´Ð° Ð·ÑÐ¾Ð±Ð¸Ð»Ð° 25 Ð³ÑÑÐ´Ð½Ñ Ð²Ð¸ÑÑÐ´Ð½Ð¸Ð¼ Ð´Ð½ÐµÐ¼|date=November 16, 2017|work=BBC Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½Ð°|access-date=November 16, 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the children see the first star in the eastern evening sky, which symbolizes the trek of the Three Wise Men, the Sviata Vechera may begin. In farming communities the head of the household now brings in a sheaf of wheat called the didukh which represents the importance of the ancient and rich wheat crops of Ukraine, the staff of life through the centuries. Didukh means literally "grandfather spirit" so it symbolizes the family's ancestors. In city homes a few stalks of golden wheat in a vase are often used to decorate the table. The dinner table sometimes has a few wisps of hay on the embroidered table cloth as a reminder of the manger in Bethlehem. A prayer is said and the father says the traditional Christmas greeting, "Chrystos rodyvsya!" which is translated to "Christ is born!", which is answered by the family with "Slavite Yoho!" which means "Let us glorify him!". In some families the Old Slavic form "Ð¡hrystos rozhdayetsya!" is used. At the end of the Sviata Vechera the family often sings Ukrainian Christmas Carols. In many communities the old Ukrainian tradition of caroling is carried on by groups of young people and members of organizations and churches calling at homes and collecting donations.

Traditionally, Christmas Day opens for Ukrainian families with attendance in church services (Mass, worship service or Divine Liturgy). Ukrainian churches offer services starting before midnight on Christmas Eve and on Christmas morning. Christmas supper, without Lenten restrictions, does not have as many traditions connected with it as Sviata Vechera. The old tradition in Ukraine of giving gifts to children on St. Nicholas Day, December 19, has generally been replaced by the Christmas date and it is the Father Frost who visits all the children in a sleigh pulled by only three reindeer. (In Western Ukraine the St. Nicholas Day is marked there on December 6.)

==== Northern Europe ====
{{Essay-like|section|date=January 2011}}

In much of Northern Europe Christmas is celebrated on December 24 and is referred to as ''Jul'' (see [[Yule]]), while December 25 is a relaxed day for visiting relatives. "Yule" may come from the Norse word hweol, jÃ³l, meaning wheel, and [[Old English]] [[gÃ©ol]]. The Norse believed that the sun was a great wheel of fire that rolled towards and then away from the earth.

===== Denmark =====
{{Main article|Jul (Denmark)}}

[[File:Julemiddag.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Traditional [[Danish people|Danish]] Christmas dinner]]

Danes celebrate on December 24, which is referred to as ''Juleaften'' (literally "Yule evening").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/denmark.htm|title=Traditions in Denmark|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An evening meal with the family consists of either roast pork, roast duck or roast goose and eaten with potatoes, plenty of gravy, and red cabbage or finely chopped kale boiled in butter. Also caramelized potatoes is an important part of the Dane's Christmas dinner. For dessert rice pudding is traditionally served â composed largely of whipped cream and accompanied by lashings of black cherry sauce. The rice pudding also contains chopped peeled almonds, and a single whole peeled almond. Whoever finds the whole almond will have good luck for the coming year, and the lucky finder is entitled to a small gift, ''Mandelgave''.
After the meal is complete, the family gathers around the Christmas tree and sings Christmas songs and hymns while holding hands and dancing in circles, and may even tour the house, still holding hands and singing. When the singing is complete, traditions vary. In some traditions, the family will select one child to hand out the presents. All children take turns handing out presents in other traditions.
Alternatively "Santa Claus", the [[Julemanden]], will appear at the door in full costume with a large sack of presents over his shoulder. He will then distribute the presents, with the assistance of any children present, to their recipients. He should be offered suitable drink to keep him warm and cheerful on his onward journey, but do not expect loquacity â utterances are normally limited to loud and hearty laughs. Meanwhile, the presents are opened and this is followed by more snacks, candy, chips and, sometimes, a traditional Christmas drink called ''[[GlÃ¸gg]].''

The Danish are somewhat famous for their ''Julefrokost,'' literally meaning "Christmas lunch", which includes various traditional Danish dishes, potentially accompanied by beer and [[Snaps]]. These Julefrokoster are popular and held within families, as well as by companies and other social groups. They would traditionally have taken place leading up to Christmas, but due to time constraints and stress during the Christmas month they are nowadays commonly held during November and January as well. The family Julefrokoster however are normally held on Christmas Day and/or The Second day of Christmas (December 26).

[[File:Adventkalender andrea.JPG|thumb|[[Advent calendar]]]]

Another more recent Danish tradition is the concept of television ''Julekalendere'', special Christmas-themed, advent calendar-type television programmes with a daily episode shown on each of the first 24&amp;nbsp;days of December, thus culminating on ''Juleaften''. Several television stations produce their own, most, but not all of which are targeted at child viewers. Some of the television advent calendars become extremely popular and go on to be reprised in subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/denmark.shtml|title=Christmas in Denmark|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Denmark, Santa Claus is known as [[Julemanden]] (literally "the Yule Man") and is said to arrive in a sleigh drawn by reindeer, with presents for the children. He is assisted with his Yuletide chores by elves known as julenisser (or simply nisser), who are traditionally believed to live in attics, barns or similar places. In some traditions, to maintain the favour and protection of these nisser, children leave out saucers of milk or rice pudding or other treats for them and are delighted to find the food gone on Christmas morning.

===== Estonia =====

In the weeks preceding Christmas or ''jÃµulud'', children place a slipper in their windows and receive a piece of candy or some other sweets from visiting elves (''pÃ¤kapikud''). Estonians celebrate Christmas on December 24, which is referred to as ''jÃµululaupÃ¤ev'' ("Christmas Saturday"){{clarify|reason=Of course this day does not always fall on a Saturday|date=January 2011}} and is by act of Parliament a [[Public holidays in Estonia|public holiday in Estonia]]. Each year on this day, the President of Estonia declares the Christmas Peace and attends a Christmas service. The tradition was initiated by the order of [[Christina of Sweden|Queen Christina]] of Sweden in the 17th century. Estonian children are visited by ''[[jÃµuluvana]]'' ("Santa Claus") on Christmas Eve, and must sing songs or recite Christmas poems before receiving their gifts.

The evening meal typically includes pork with sauerkraut or Estonian sauerkraut (''mulgikapsad''), baked potatoes, white and blood sausage, potato salad with red beet, and pÄtÃ©. For dessert, Estonians eat gingerbread (''piparkoogid'') and marzipan. The most highly regarded drinks during this time have been beer and mulled wine or ''[[glÃ¶gi]]'' and ''hÃµÃµgvein'' ("glowing wine"). Estonians leave the leftover food from Christmas dinner on the table overnight, in hopes that the spirits of family, friends, and loved ones will visit and also have something to eat. It is also customary to visit graveyards and leave candles for the deceased.

December 25 or ''jÃµulupÃ¼ha'' is a relaxed day for visiting relatives.

===== Finland =====
{{main|Christmas in Finland}}
[[File:Christmas presents and a tree.jpg|thumbnail|Christmas presents and a tree in Finland]]
[[File:Joulukinkku.jpg|thumbnail|Christmas ham]]

Christmas is an extensively prepared celebration centering on the family and home, although it has a religious dimension also. The Christmas season starts from December or even in late November, when shops began advertising potential Christmas gifts. Christmas decorations and songs become more prominent as Christmas nears, and children count days to Christmas with [[Advent calendar]]s. Schools and some other places have the day before Christmas Eve (''aatonaatto'', December 23) as a holiday, but at the latest on the Christmas Eve (''jouluaatto'', December 24), shops close early and stay closed until December 26. The main Christmas festivities are held on Christmas Eve on December 24, while Christmas Day (''joulupÃ¤ivÃ¤'') and the following day (''TapaninpÃ¤ivÃ¤'', "St. Stephen's Day") are mandatory [[public holidays in Finland]]&lt;ref name="Christmas in Finland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/finland.shtml|title=Christmas in Finland|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools continue holidays up to the New Year.

The Declaration of [[Christmas Peace]] has been a tradition in Finland from [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]] every year, except in 1939 due to the [[Winter War]]. It is a custom in many towns and cities. The most famous one of these declarations is on the Old Great Square of [[Turku]], the former capital of Finland, at noon on Christmas Eve. It is broadcast on Finnish radio (since 1935) and television, and nowadays also in some foreign countries. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn ''Jumala ompi linnamme'' ([[Martin Luther]]'s ''[[A Mighty Fortress Is Our God]]'') by a band of the [[Finnish Navy]] and a male choir and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll, in both Finnish and Swedish, the country's two official languages:

: Tomorrow, God willing, is the most gracious feast of the birth of our Lord and Saviour, and therefore a general Christmas peace is hereby declared, and all persons are directed to observe this holiday with due reverence and otherwise quietly and peacefully to conduct themselves, for whosoever breaks this peace and disturbs the Christmas holiday by any unlawful or improper conduct shall be liable, under aggravating circumstances, to whatever penalty is prescribed by law and decree for each particular offence or misdemeanour. Finally, all citizens are wished a joyous Christmas holiday.

The ceremony ends with trumpets playing the Finnish [[national anthem]] ''[[Maamme]]'' and ''[[BjÃ¶rneborgarnas marsch|Porilaisten marssi]]'', with the crowd usually singing when the band plays ''Maamme''. Recently, there is also a declaration of Christmas peace for forest animals in many cities and municipalities, so there is no hunting during Christmas.

[[File:Hundreds of candles and a Christian Cross at a cemetery on Christmas eve.jpg|thumb|It is traditional in Finland to bring candles to the graves of loved ones on Christmas Eve and [[All Saints Day]].]]

Finnish people clean their homes well before Christmas and prepare special treats for the festive season. A sheaf of grain, nuts and seeds are tied on a pole, which is placed in the garden for the birds to feed on. Spruce trees are cut or bought from a market and taken to homes on or a few days before Christmas Eve and are decorated. Candles are lit on the Christmas tree, which is traditionally decorated using apples and other fruit, candies, paper flags, cotton and tinsel, in addition to [[Christmas ornaments]] such as stars or baubles. Actual candles are no longer used, being replaced by incandescent or LED lamps. A star symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem is placed at the top of the tree. Just before the Christmas festivities begin, people usually take a Christmas [[sauna]]. The tradition is very old; unlike on normal days, when one would go to the sauna in the evening, on Christmas Eve it is done before sunset. This tradition is based on a pre-20th century belief that the spirits of the dead return and have a sauna at the usual sauna hours.&lt;ref name="Christmas in Finland"/&gt;

Afterwards, they dress up in clean clothes for the Christmas dinner or [[joulupÃ¶ytÃ¤]], which is usually served between 5pm and 7pm, or traditionally with the appearance of the first star in the sky. The most traditional dish of the Finnish Christmas dinner is probably [[Christmas Ham]], roast suckling pig or a roasted fresh ham, but some may prefer alternatives like turkey. Several sorts of [[casserole]]s, like rutabaga, carrot and potato casserole are traditional, and are almost always exclusively served on Christmas. Other traditional Christmas dishes include [[lutefisk|boiled codfish]] (soaked beforehand in a lye solution for a week to soften it) served snowy white and fluffy, pickled [[herring]] and vegetables. Prune jam pastries, plum or mixed fruit soup, rice porridge with cinnamon, sugar and cold milk, and sweets like chocolate are popular desserts. Christmas gifts are usually exchanged after Christmas Eve dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=180237&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US|title=Christmas in Finland|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children do not hang up stockings in Finland but ''[[Joulupukki]]'' visits the household, maybe with a ''[[tonttu]]'' to help him distribute the presents.

Christmas Day services begin early at six in the morning and people visit families and reunions are arranged on this day.

Boxing Day, or ''tapaninpÃ¤ivÃ¤'' ([[St. Stephen]]'s Day) is traditionally set aside for driving around the village (''tapaninajot''), to counterbalance the solemn and family-oriented part of Christmas.

===== Iceland =====
{{Main article|JÃ³l (Iceland)}}

The Christmas or [[Yule]] ([[JÃ³l (Iceland)|JÃ³l]] in Icelandic)&lt;ref name="Christmas in Iceland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/iceland.shtml|title=Christmas in Iceland|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebration in Iceland starts four Sundays before Christmas proper, which begins on December 24 (Advent) and ends thirteen days later on January 6. Traditionally, one candle is lit each Sunday until four candles are lit on the 24th. At 6:00&amp;nbsp;pm [[Church bell]]s ring to start the Christmas celebration. The religiously observant and/or traditional Icelanders will attend mass at this time while the secular Icelanders will begin their holiday meal immediately. After the meal is finished, they open gifts and spend the evening together. In Iceland people over the [[Icelandic cuisine#Christmas dishes|Yule holidays most often eat]] Most popular dishes are smoked lamb, ptarmigan and turkey. Pork is also very popular.

Thirteen days before December 24 the [[Yule Lads]] children will leave their shoes by the window so that the Yule Lads can leave small gifts in their shoes.&lt;ref name="Christmas in Iceland"/&gt; The Yule Lads are the sons of two trolls living in the Icelandic mountains. Each of the Yule Lads is known for a different kind of mischief (for example slamming doors, stealing meat, stealing milk or eating the candles). The Yule Lads traditionally wear early Icelandic wool clothing but are now known for the more recognizable red and white suit.

Each home typically sets up a Christmas tree indoors in the living room with most decorating it on December 11. In addition to the decorations, presents are put underneath the tree. It is also a tradition in many homes to boil skate on the 23rd. The day is called Saint Thorlak Mass (ÃorlÃ¡ksmessa).

During the holiday season, it is traditional for families to work together to bake small cookies to serve or give to guests. Most common are thin gingerbread cookies which are decorated in many different colors of glaze. Many families also follow the tradition of making LaufabrauÃ° (Leafbread), which is a flat thin bread that is cut out using a special tool and folding technique.

The end of year is divided between two days â the Old Year's Day (GamlÃ¡rsdagur) and the New Year's Day (NÃ½Ã¡rsdagur). At the night of the former and morning of the latter Icelanders shoot up fireworks blowing the old year away and welcoming the new one.

Thirteen days after the 24th Icelanders say goodbye to the Yule Lads and other mystical creatures such as elves and trolls. There are bonfires held throughout the country while the elves, Yule Lads, and Icelanders dance together before saying goodbye until the next Christmas.&lt;ref name="Christmas in Iceland"/&gt;

===== Norway =====
{{Main article|Jul (Norway)}}

[[File:JuletrÃ¦slys.jpg|thumb|[[Christmas tree]] with a [[candle]]]]

[[File:Gifts xmas.jpg|thumb|Christmas [[gifts]]]]

The major day of celebration in Norway, as in most of Northern Europe, is December 24. Although it is legally a regular workday until 16:00,&lt;ref name="Christmas in Norway"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/norway.shtml|title=Christmas in Norway|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; most stores close early. Church bells chime in the Christmas holiday between 17:00 and 18:00. In some families the Christmas story from Luke 2 will be read from the old family Bible. The main Christmas meal is served in the evening. Common main dishes include pork rib, "[[pinnekjÃ¸tt]]" (pieces of lamb rib steamed on a grid of birch wood). Many people also eat "[[lutefisk]]" or fresh, poached cod. Rice porridge is also popular (but most commonly served as an early lunch rather than for the main Christmas dinner), an almond is often hidden in the porridge, and the person who finds it wins a treat or small gift. In some parts of Norway it is common to place porridge outside (in a barn, outhouse or even in the forest) to please "Nissen". In many families, where the parents grew up with different traditions, two different main dishes are served to please everyone. If children are present (and they have behaved well the last year), "Julenissen" (Santa Claus) pays a visit, otherwise gifts are stored under the Christmas tree.&lt;ref name="Christmas in Norway"/&gt;

For a lot of Norwegians, especially families, television is an important part of the earlier hours of Christmas Eve. Many Norwegians do not feel the Christmas spirit until they have watched the Czech-German fairy tale ''[[TÅi oÅÃ­Å¡ky pro Popelku|Three Nuts for Cinderella]]'' (Norwegian title: ''Tre nÃ¸tter til Askepott''), the Disney Christmas cavalcade ''[[From All of Us to All of You]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvparty.com/xmas-disney.html|title=Christmas in Norway fairytale|author=TVparty|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Norwegian fairytale movie ''Reisen til Julestjernen'' or the comedy sketch ''[[Dinner for One]]''. Attending one of the many stage productions of ''[[Putti Plutti Pott and Santa's Beard]]'' is also a very popular tradition.

December 25 is a very quiet and relaxed day. Church services are well attended. The old tradition of a very early morning service before breakfast has been replaced in most areas by a service in the later morning. Afterward many families get together for a large festive meal.&lt;ref name="Christmas in Norway"/&gt;

December 26 is also a day of many festivities. Cinemas, night clubs and bars are full, and there are lots of private gatherings and parties, where all kinds of traditional [[Christmas cookies]] and sweets are enjoyed. Fatty, tasty dinners are also part of it. The time between Boxing Day and New Year's Eve is called [[:wikt:romjul|romjul]]. During this time children in some parts of Norway dress up as "nisser" and go "Julebukk" â "Christmas goat" â in their neighbourhoods and sing Christmas carols to receive treats, much the same way as in the American [[Halloween]]. January 6 (13th day of Christmas) is commonly regarded as the end of Christmas, while some end Christmas on the 20th day, and some even at Candlemas.

[[File:Christmas-Goat.JPG|thumb|Julbock, a giant Christmas goat at the [[GÃ¤vle]] town market, Sweden]]

The pre-Christian holiday of [[Yule]], or ''jÃ³l'', was the most important holiday in Scandinavia and Northern Europe.&lt;ref name="Christmas in Sweden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/sweden.shtml|title=Christmas in Sweden|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the observance of the [[winter solstice]], and the rebirth of the sun, it brought about many practices that remain in the [[Advent]] and [[Christmas]] celebrations today. The Yule season was a time for feasting, drinking, gift-giving, and gatherings, but also the season of awareness and fear of the forces of the dark. Swedish Christmas celebrations begin with the first of [[Advent]]. [[Saint Lucy's Day]] (locally known as ''Luciadagen'') which is the first major Christmas celebration before Christmas itself. The eldest daughter arising early and wearing her Lucy garb of white robe, red sash, and a wire crown covered with whortleberry-twigs with nine lighted candles fastened in it awakens the family, singing "Santa Lucia", serving them coffee and [[saffron bun]]s ([[St. Lucia buns]]), thus ushering in the Christmas season.&lt;ref name=Matthews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ac-support.europe.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/Lucy.html|title=Matthews, Jeff. "Everybody Loves Lucy", University of Maryland University College â Italian Studies|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903152016/http://ac-support.europe.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/Lucy.html|archivedate=September 3, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools elect a Lucia and her maids among the students and a national Lucia is elected on national television from regional winners. The regional Lucias will visit shopping malls, old people's homes and churches, singing and handing out ''pepparkakor'' [[gingerbread]] cookies.

Boys take part in the procession as well, playing different roles associated with Christmas. Some may be dressed in the same kind of white robe, but with a cone-shaped hat decorated with golden stars, called ''stjÃ¤rngossar'' (star boys); some may be dressed up as "[[tomte]]nissar", carrying lanterns; and some may be dressed up as [[gingerbread man|gingerbread men]]. They participate in the singing and also have a song or two of their own, usually ''Staffan StalledrÃ¤ng'', which tells the story about [[Saint Stephen]], the first Christian [[martyr]], caring for his five horses.
Electric candles and glowing stars are placed in almost every window in the month of December in Sweden. Although December 25 (''juldagen'') is a [[Public holidays in Sweden|Swedish public holiday]], December 24 is the day when Santa Claus ''Jultomte'' (or simply ''[[Tomte]]'') brings the presents. Although not a public holiday, Christmas Eve is a ''de facto'' holiday in the sense that most workplaces are closed, and those who work, for instance in shops or care homes, get extra wages as a compensation. (''See also: [[Public holidays in Sweden]] for further explanation of this concept.'')

The Jultomte was originally a small invisible Christmas house gnome or dwarf from the Nordic mythology, who watched over the house and its inhabitants. An old superstition still calls for feeding the Tomte on Christmas Eve with a small bowl of porridge. If a bowl of porridge is not laid out for him somewhere in or outside the house, he will bring bad luck to everyone in the house the next year. The modern "Tomten", nowadays is a version of Santa Claus in red cloth and white beard, except that he doesn't enter the house through the chimney, but knocks on the door and asks "finns det nÃ¥gra snÃ¤lla barn hÃ¤r?" ("are there any nice children here?")

Christmas is, as everywhere else, an occasion celebrated with food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/sweden.htm|title=Traditions in Sweden|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all Swedish families celebrate on December 24 with a Christmas table, called Christmas [[smÃ¶rgÃ¥sbord]] (''[[julbord]]''), a display of several Christmas food items. Almost all julbord has Christmas ham, (''[[julskinka]]'') accompanied by other Christmas dishes, such as small [[wikt:meatball|meatball]]s, [[pickled herring]], [[spareribs]], small hot dogs, [[lutfisk]], pork sausage, salmon, [[Janssons frestelse]] (potato casserole with anchovy), and [[rice pudding]]. The Christmas julbord is served with [[julmust]] and beverage like mulled wine, Christmas beer or [[snaps]]. A Scandinavian speciality is the ''[[glogg|glÃ¶gg]]'' (mulled and spiced wine with almonds and raisins), which is served hot in small cups. The different dishes of the julbord may vary throughout Sweden, from South to North. Businesses traditionally invite their employees to a julbord dinner or lunch the weeks before Christmas, and people go out privately to restaurants which also customarily offer julbord during December.

Examples of candies and treats associated with Christmas are [[marzipan]], toffee, [[knÃ¤ck]] (quite similar to butterscotch), nuts and fruits: figs, chocolate, dates and oranges decorated with cloves.

Television also plays a big role, many families watch the Disney Christmas special ''Kalle Anka och hans vÃ¤nner Ã¶nskar God Jul''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0908282/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv|title=From All of Us to All of You|work=IMDb|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[From All of Us to All of You]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0908282/|title=From All of Us to All of You|work=IMDb|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Karl Bertil Jonssons julafton]]'' (animated short), or a re-run of the ''[[Svensson, Svensson]]'' episode ''God Jul!'' (''Merry Christmas'') on the TV channel [[SVT1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://slate.com/id/2239252/ |title=Nordic Quack: Sweden's bizarre tradition of watching Donald Duck cartoons on Christmas Eve |author=Jeremy Stahl |work=Slate |date=December 22, 2009 |quote="At 3&amp;nbsp;o'clock in the afternoon, you can't to do anything else, because Sweden is closed"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the julbord on December 24, the presents are distributed, either by Jultomten or a family member, and usually from a sack or from under the Christmas tree where they have been lying all day or for several days.

[[File:Orange pomander.jpg|thumb|left|Around Christmas people hang oranges decorated with cloves in the window or place it on the table.]]

Many Swedes still adhere to the tradition that each present should have a rhyme written on the wrapping paper, to hint at the contents without revealing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/12/22/sweden.christmas/|title=With food, drink and candles, Sweden embraces Christmas|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408012151/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/12/22/sweden.christmas/|archivedate=April 8, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In older days a [[yule goat]] was an alternative to Jultomten, nowadays it is used as an ornament, ranging from sizes of 10&amp;nbsp;cm to huge constructions like the giant straw Christmas [[GÃ¤vle goat]], famous for frequently being vandalised or burnt down. If one has two families to celebrate Christmas with, it is common that one of the families move their celebrations to Christmas Day or the day before Christmas Eve (commonly referred to as ''little Christmas Eve'').

After December 24, the Christmas celebrations have more or less come to an end. Some people attend the [[julottan]], an early morning church service on December 25. This particular service was the main service of Christmas historicallyânowadays, the [[Midnight Mass]] has become increasingly popular. Others attend a simpler service called ''Christmas Prayer'' in the afternoon of Christmas Eve; however, many Swedes do not attend church at all during Christmas as the country is very [[secular]]. Even so, most families do set up a ''Julkrubba'' (''[[Nativity scene|Christmas Crib]]''). On January 13 (locally known as ''knutdagen'' or ''tjugondag knut'', English = twentiethday Christmas), 20&amp;nbsp;days after Christmas, the Christmas celebrations come to an end and all Christmas decorations are removed.&lt;ref name="Christmas in Sweden"/&gt;

==== Southern Europe ====

===== Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia =====

[[File:Bozicna psenica.jpg|thumb|upright|Croatian wheat grass, planted on St. Lucy's, used for Christmas candles]]

{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia, Christmas (Croatian: ''BoÅ¾iÄ'', Slovene: ''BoÅ¾iÄ'') is celebrated mainly as a religious holiday. The festivities begin on [[Saint Nicholas]]'s Day on December 6 (in Slovenia) or [[St. Lucy]]'s on December 13 depending on what region (in Croatia). St. Lucy or St. Nicholas brings children presents, and St. Nicholas is said to be accompanied by [[Krampus]] who steals away the presents of bad children. This "anti-Santa" is said to have one cloven hoof, a handful of heavy chains, and a sack on his back to collect naughty children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardstore.com/christmas-around-the-world |title=How is Christmas Celebrated Around the World |work=CardStore.com |accessdate=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Croatia on St. Lucy's, families will plant wheat seeds in a bowl of shallow water, which will grow several inches by Christmas and are then tied together with a red, blue and white ribbon called ''trobojnica'.

On Christmas Eve (Croatian: ''Badnjak'', Slovene: ''Sveti veÄer'' (holy eve)), three candles representing the [[Trinity]] are lit and placed in the middle of the wheat, the glow symbolizes the soul of each person. On this day, the tree is decorated, the home is decked with greenery and the women already beginning to prepare the Christmas meal. They also bake special types of bread: one is round inscribed with a cross on top known as the ''cesnica'', another is made with honey, nuts and dried fruit called the Christmas Eve Bread (Croatian: ''Badnji Kruh'', Slovene: ''BoÅ¾iÄni kruh''). In many villages, straw (which symbolizes Christ's birth in the manger) is spread around the floors of the home for the Christmas Eve dinner. As is customary with Catholic people, meat is not consumed in Croatia, while in Slovenia it is. Instead of meat in Croatia and with other food in Slovenia, salad and fish is served, many choosing to eat the [[Dalmatia]]n specialty ''bakalar'', dried cod fish. The family then sprinkle holy water on their [[Yule log]] (''badnjak'') which they light and watch. In villages, the badnjak is freshly cut that very morning by the father of the household while reciting traditional prayers. At the end of the meal, a piece of the ''cesnica'' is cut and dipped in wine and used to sprinkle on the candles to extinguish them, while reciting the [[Trinitarian formula]] ("In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen").

Many families will go to a midnight mass on Christmas Eve and often another on Christmas Day. It is common for Christmas presents to be placed under the tree, to suggest that the Angel or the Baby Jesus (''Mali Isus'') leaves them there while others are attending midnight mass. Presents are opened after the mass. Christmas is a day of celebrating with family; a large feast is prepared and traditional foods such as stuffed cabbage, turkey, pot roast, pita and smoked meat are served, along with various desserts such as [[fritule]], [[potica]] (especially in Slovenia), [[strudel]], and cookies.

Slovenes are also visited by another one of their ''trije dobri moÅ¾je'' (three good guys), who bring presents in December: Saint Nicholas, Santa Claus and Dedek Mraz ("Grandfather Frost"). Families mostly celebrate New Year's Eve at home with extended family members, friends, and sometimes neighbours. Women prepare [[sarma (food)|cabbage sarma]], which they will eat on January 1 to symbolize good fortune, and [[steak tartare]], which they eat on New Year's Eve on toast with butter. At midnight, people go outdoors to watch fireworks, while Dedek Mraz leaves presents under the tree. Epiphany on January 6 marks the end of the Christmas season.

In Bulgaria, Christmas ({{lang-bg|ÐÐ¾Ð»ÐµÐ´Ð°}}, ''[[Koleda]]'' or more formally Ð Ð¾Ð¶Ð´ÐµÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ð¥ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐ¾Ð²Ð¾, ''Rozhdestvo Hristovo'', "Nativity of Jesus") is celebrated on December 25 and is preceded by Christmas Eve (ÐÑÐ´Ð½Ð¸ Ð²ÐµÑÐµÑ, ''Badni vecher''). Traditionally, Christmas Eve would be the climax of the [[Nativity Fast]], and thus only an odd number of lenten dishes are presented on that evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santas.net/bulgarianchristmas.htm|title=Bulgarian Christmas|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The table is usually not cleared after the dinner and until the next morning, to leave some food for the holy spirits â a custom which probably comes from pagan pre-Christian times. On that day, a [[Bulgarian budnik]] is set alight. On Christmas, however, meat dishes are already allowed and are typically served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goeasteurope.about.com/od/bulgariatravel/a/bulgariachristmastraditions.htm|title=Bulgaria's Christmas Traditions|publisher=Aboutcom|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Bulgarian Christmas traditions is [[Koledari (Bulgarian)|koleduvane]], which involves boy carolers (ÐºÐ¾Ð»ÐµÐ´Ð°ÑÐ¸, ''koledari'') visiting the neighbouring houses starting at midnight on Christmas Eve, wishing health, wealth and happiness. Another custom is the baking of a traditional round loaf (Ð¿Ð¸ÑÐ°, ''[[pita]]''). The pita is broken into pieces by the head of the family and a piece is given to each family member, a valuable possession, and a piece for God. A coin is hidden inside the pita and whoever gets the coin, he or she will have luck, health, and prosperity in the coming year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indobase.com/holidays/christmas/world/christmas-in-bulgaria.html|title=Christmas in bulgaria|publisher=Indobase|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other countries, a Christmas tree is typically set up and the entire house is decorated. The local name of Santa Claus is Dyado Koleda (ÐÑÐ´Ð¾ ÐÐ¾Ð»ÐµÐ´Ð°, "Grandfather Christmas"), with Dyado Mraz (ÐÑÐ´Ð¾ ÐÑÐ°Ð·, "Grandfather Frost") being a similar Russian-imported character lacking the Christian connotations and thus popular during the Communist rule. However, it has been largely forgotten after 1989, when Dyado Koleda again returned as the more popular figure.

===== Greece and Cyprus =====

[[File:Athens Christmas Tree.jpg|thumb|Christmas tree at [[Syntagma Square]], Athens, Greece]]

The festive period lasts from November 30 to January 6 (Epiphany) on the [[Public holidays in Greece|Greek calendar]]. December 25 and 26 is a [[Public holidays in Greece|public holiday in Greece]]. In [[Greek Language|Greek]], Christmas is known as Christougena (Î§ÏÎ¹ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ³ÎµÎ½Î½Î±) and people wish Merry Christmas to each other saying Kala Christougenna (ÎÎ±Î»Î¬ Î§ÏÎ¹ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ³ÎµÎ½Î½Î±). Most families set up Christmas trees and shops have decorations and lights. Presents are placed under the Christmas tree and are opened on January 1, St Basil's Day. In Greek tradition, [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil's (of Caesarea)]] name was given to Father Christmas and is supposed to visit children and give presents on January 1 (when Basil's memory is celebrated), unlike other European traditions, where this person is Saint Nicholas and comes every Christmas. Carol singing is another tradition on Christmas and New Year's Eve. The Christmas meal usually includes lamb or pork and desserts such as [[kourabies]] (ÎºÎ¿ÏÏÎ±Î¼ÏÎ¹Î­Ï) and [[melomakarona]] (Î¼ÎµÎ»Î¿Î¼Î±ÎºÎ¬ÏÎ¿Î½Î±). Other Christmas and new year foods include 'Baklava' (sweet pastry), Kataifi (pastry), Theeples (a kind of fried pastry).

[[File:Smallhoneycake.JPG|thumb|left|Small honeycakes]]

Christmas Eve on December 24 and 23 housewives make the Christmas cake with a cross in the middle and avgokouloures which are subsequently offered to the elderly and children. Children singing carols from house to house either before or on Christmas Day. People go to church early the morning of Christmas on December 25. Christmas morning after church there is the practice to become the "pork batches," served with wine to open the appetite, and "thick," done by Eve, which is boiled pork with plenty of lemon that is left to clot overnight. The pork-food is in the hallmark of Greek Christmas. In many Greek cities and ports like [[Thessaloniki]], [[Volos]], [[Patras|Patra]], the [[List of islands of Greece|Greek Islands]] etc., it is decorated the traditional Christmas boat. And in many central squares of the country a big Christmas tree, where  many of the Christmas festivals take place.

Some of the Christmas Festivals in Greece are "Î¡Î¿ÏÎ³ÎºÎ±ÏÏÎ¬ÏÎ¹Î±" ''RugatsariÎ±'', where all the residents of the city of [[Kastoria]] are delivered in a separate [[Dionysos|Dionysian]] revelry, with the accompaniment of folk melodies bodies all traditional musical sounds of the area. This ancient habit, whose origin is lost in time.
In [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]] there are beliefs about demonic and other supernatural beings, who come from the Twelve Days of Christ as the Epiphany. These are the goblins and say that they are the descendants [[Pan (god)|God Pan]] or [[Satyrs]], who jumped from the [[mythology]] in the Christian life.

The [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]] (Italian Festa dell'Immacolata Concezione) on December 8 is a [[Public holidays in Italy|national holiday in Italy]]. Christmas decorations, including the [[nativity scene|presepe]] (nativity scene),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/italy.shtml|title=Christmas in Italy|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Christmas tree, are usually put up on this day. Some modern takes on this holiday involve them hanging [[vultures]] to symbolize the cleaning of their spirits.

[[Saint Lucy's Day]] (Italian: Giorno di Santa Lucia) is celebrated as a Catholic holiday in [[Sicily]] and Northern regions of Italy on the supposed [[Shortest day]] of the year which is December 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/milleldred/donnenocturnal.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027042302/http://www.geocities.com/milleldred/donnenocturnal.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=October 27, 2009 |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Lucy]] is the patron saint of the city of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] better known as ''[[Santa Lucia]]'' as she is called in the traditional [[Canzone Napoletana|Neapolitan song]]. Evening candlelight processions called the parade of light are conducted and are followed by the Feast of St. Lucy. Sicilians pay tribute to a miracle performed by St Lucy during a famine in 1582. At that time, she brought a flotilla of grain-bearing ships to starving Sicily, whose citizens cooked and ate the wheat without taking time to grind it into flour. Thus, on St. Lucy's Day, Sicilians do not eat anything made with wheat flour. Instead they eat cooked wheat called [[cuccÃ¬a]].

It is quite common to attend midnight mass on Christmas Eve and practice the custom not to eat any meat. The dinner traditionally consists of seafood, with the [[Feast of the Seven Fishes]], followed by typical Italian Christmas sweets, such as [[pandoro]], [[panettone]], [[torrone]], [[panforte]], [[struffoli]], [[caggionetti]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeinabruzzo.com/caggionetti-calgionetti-caggiunitt-christmas-time/ |title=Caggionetti, Calgionetti, Caggiunitt at Christmas Time |publisher=Life in Abruzzo |date=December 22, 2010 |accessdate=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mont Blanc (dessert)|Monte Bianco]] or others, depending on the regional cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sicilianculture.com/food/xmasfish.htm |title=Food: Italian Christmas Eve Fish Dinner |publisher=Sicilian Culture |date=December 25, 2002 |accessdate=December 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120911142601/http://www.sicilianculture.com/food/xmasfish.htm |archivedate=September 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christmas on the 25th is celebrated with a family lunch, consisting of different types of meat dishes, cheese and local sweets.

The ancient Christmas festival called [[Ndocciata]] is celebrated on December 8 and Christmas Eve in [[Agnone]], [[Molise]], with a parade of torches leading up to the "Bonfire of Brotherhood".&lt;ref&gt;Nino Modugno ''Il mondo magico della notte delle streghe.

On Christmas Eve, in the squares of many towns of the eastern [[Sicily]], a big bonfire, ''U Zuccu'', is lit to warm the [[Baby Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folclore.it/En/Events/Italy/Sicily/Catania/Acireale/U-zuccu.html |title=U zuccu 2017 di Acireale â Local Festivals, Sicily â Folclore |publisher=Folclore.it |date=December 20, 2011 |accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=December 2015|reason=looks user-edited}}

Traditions regarding the exchanging of gifts vary from region to region, as this might take place either on Christmas Eve or on Christmas Day. Presents for children are left underneath the Christmas tree either by Santa Claus (called [[:it:Babbo Natale|Babbo Natale]]) or, according to older traditions, by Baby Jesus himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/italy.htm|title=Christmas traditions in Italy|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some regions children receive gifts earlier (at St. Lucy's Day) or later (on Epiphany).

December 26, (St. Stephen's Day, in Italian Giorno di Santo Stefano), is also a public holiday in Italy. Festivities extend to the end of the year and then to the Epiphany.

On January 6 (Epiphany, in Italian Epifania) decorations are usually taken down, and in some areas female puppets are burned on a pire (called "''[[Bonfire|falÃ²]]''"), to symbolize, along with the end of the Christmas period, the death of the old year and the beginning of a new one.&lt;ref name="trevisoinfo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trevisoinfo.com/bonfires-veneto.htm |title=Traditional Bonfires of Veneto in winter solstice northeast italy winter solstice fires treviso traditions of veneto |publisher=Trevisoinfo.com |date=January 5, 2008 |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While gifts are now given at Christmas by an American style Santa Claus as well, Italy holds fast to its tradition of native gift-givers. On the eve of the 6th, [[la Befana]], the good Epiphany witch, is thought to ride the night skies on broomstick, bringing good children gifts and sweets, and bad ones charcoal or bags of ashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ricksteves.com/news/tribune/epiphany.htm |title=Rick Steves' Europe: Epiphany in Europe: Sweetness to share |last=Steves |first=Rick |publisher=RickSteves.com |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other areas it is the [[Three Wise Men]] who bring gifts, especially oranges symbolizing gold, and chocolate symbolizing their kisses to good children. In some municipalities, most famously in [[Milan]], the custom of the "Corteo dei Re Magi" (Three Kings Procession) is elaboratedly celebrated with a parade welcoming the Wise Men, and the passing out of sweets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XixojYgnRtsC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Three+Kings+Procession+milan#v=onepage&amp;q=Three%20Kings%20Procession%20milan&amp;f=false |title=Italy |publisher=Google Books |isbn=9781860111136 |date=January 1, 2004 |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other places, such as [[Treviso]] the day is celebrated with bonfires, the sparks of which are said to predict the future of the new year.&lt;ref name="trevisoinfo.com"/&gt;

===== Malta =====
{{see also|Christmas Eve Procession}}

Christmas ({{lang-mt|Il-Milied}}) in [[Malta]] is mostly secular, with a number of Christian-related themes.

Midnight Masses are popular amng the older generations, and Christmas processions take place on Christmas Eve with a statue of the baby Jesus in towns and villages, led by the [[Society of Christian Doctrine]].

A [[Public holidays in Malta|public holiday in Malta]], Christmas Day is celebrated on December 25. Christmas lunch usually consists of turkey served with potatoes and vegetables (Malta is a former [[British colony]]). The island has adopted other popular secular customs and traditions such as the Christmas tree and Father Christmas.

Presents are normally generally exchanged either on Christmas Eve or on Christmas Day. A local seasonal food is the "Qaghaq ta' l-Ghasel" (Honey Ring). These Maltese Christmas sweets are eaten as a dessert during the Christmas season but can also be purchased all year round. Christmas cribs are a popular and are seen in most homes.

Another Christmas tradition is the planting of [[common vetch]] seeds in flat-bottomed pots. They are planted around the beginning of December, normally placed on white cotton and watered every day whilst being kept in the dark all the time. They are usually taken out just before Christmas, and resemble long white spaghetti-like strands of leaves (since they would have grown in the dark).

===== Portugal =====

[[File:Christmas decorations in Braga (6).JPG|thumb|Christmas decorations in Braga]]

Christmas, an [[Public holidays in Portugal|official holiday in Portugal]], is widely celebrated and is associated with family gatherings. People who have moved to the main cities, like [[Lisbon]] or [[Porto]], or even those who have emigrated to other countries, still travel to their home towns and villages to spend Christmas Eve with their families. After the ''Missa do galo'' (Rooster's Mass) that celebrates the birth of Christ, families gather around the ''Consoada'', the late supper held on Christmas Eve. The traditional dish is ''bacalhau com todos'' (dried codfish boiled with vegetables), although, in northern Portugal, the bacalhau is often replaced by octopus. The Christmas dinner usually ends with ''fatias douradas'' (golden slices), ''filhoses'' and ''sonhos'' (dreams), all desserts based on fried flour or fried bread. Another traditional cake is the [[Bolo Rei|king cake]] served on Epiphany. Nowadays, although Santa Claus (''Pai Natal'') is more popular, in some regions people still believe that it is the ''Menino Jesus'' (Baby Jesus) who brings presents to children.

===== Serbia and Montenegro=====

[[File:Christmas-Serbian Ortodox Äesnica.jpg|thumb|Serbian Orthodox Christmas bread]]

{{Main article|Serbian Christmas traditions|Badnjak (Serbian)}}

In [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]], Christmas ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ÐÐ¾Ð¶Ð¸Ñ, ''BoÅ¾iÄ'' or more formally Ð Ð¾Ð¶Ð´ÐµÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ð¥ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐ¾Ð²Ð¾, Rozhdestvo Hristovo, "Nativity of Christ") is celebrated for three consecutive days, beginning with Christmas Day. The [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] uses the traditional Julian calendar, per which Christmas Day (December 25) falls on January 7. This day is called the first day of Christmas, and the following two are accordingly called the second, and the third day of Christmas. During this festive time, one is to greet another person with "Christ is Born," which should be responded to with "Truly He is Born." The [[Serbian language|Serbian]] name for Christmas is ''BoÅ¾iÄ'' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]]: ÐÐ¾Ð¶Ð¸Ñ, {{IPA-sh|boÊitÉ|pron}}), which means the young or little God.

This holiday surpasses all the others celebrated by Serbs, with respect to the diversity of applied folk customs and rituals. These may vary from region to region, some of them having modern versions adapted to the contemporary way of living. The ideal environment to carry them out fully is the traditional multi-generation country household.

In the morning of Christmas Eve a young, straight oak tree is selected and felled by the head of the household. A log is cut from it and is referred to as the [[Badnjak (Serbian)|badnjak]]. In the evening, the badnjak is ceremoniously put on the domestic fire that burns on the house's fireplace called ''ognjiÅ¡te'', whose hearth is without a vertical surround. The burning of the ''badnjak'' is accompanied by prayers to God so that the coming year may bring much happiness, love, luck, riches, and food. Since most houses today have no ''ognjiÅ¡te'' on which to burn a ''badnjak'', it is symbolically represented by several leaved oak twigs. For the convenience of people who live in towns and cities, they can be bought at marketplaces or received in churches.

The dinner on this day is festive, copious and diverse in foods, although it is prepared in accordance with the rules of fasting. Groups of young people go from house to house of their village or neighbourhood, congratulating each other, singing, and making performances; this continues through the next three days. The Serbs also take a bundle of straw into the house and spread it over the floor, and then put walnuts on it. Before the table is served for the Christmas Eve dinner, it is strewn with a thin layer of straw and covered with a white cloth. The head of household makes the [[Sign of the Cross]], lights a candle, and [[Censer|cense]]s the whole house. The family members sit down at the table, but before tucking in they all rise and a man or boy among them says a prayer, or they together sing the [[Troparion]] of the Nativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After the dinner young people visit their friends, a group of whom may gather at the house of one of them. Christmas and other songs are sung, while the elderly narrate stories from the olden times.

On Christmas Day, the celebration is announced at dawn by church bells and by shooting. A big importance is given to the first visit a family receives that day. People expect that it will summon prosperity and well-being for their household in the ensuing year; this visit is often pre-arranged. Christmas dinner is the most celebratory meal a family has during a year. A special, festive loaf of bread is baked for this occasion. The main course is roast pork of a pig which they cook whole by rotating it impaled on a wooden spit close to an open fire. Even though gift-giving is not necessarily a part of the tradition, a [[Santa Claus]] inspired character called BoÅ¾iÄ Bata (translated as Christmas friend) sometimes takes his during gift giving, as Santa Claus is more traditionally connected to New Years celebrations. Gift-giving is, nevertheless, connected with the celebrations, being traditionally done on the three consecutive Sundays that immediately precede it. Children, women, and men, respectively, are the set gift-givers on these three days.

Since the early 1990s, the Serbian Orthodox Church has, together with local communities, organized public celebrations on Christmas Eve. The course of these celebrations can be typically divided into three parts: the preparation, the ritual, and the festivity. The preparation consists of going and cutting down the tree to be used as the ''badnjak'', taking it to the church yard, and preparing drink and food for the assembled parishioners. The ritual includes [[Vespers]], placing the ''badnjak'' on the open fire built in the church yard, blessing or consecrating the ''badnjak'', and an appropriate program with songs and recitals. In some parishes they build the fire on which to burn the ''badnjak'' not in the church yard but at some other suitable location in their town or village. The festivity consists of getting together around the fire and socializing. Each particular celebration, however, has its own specificities which reflect traditions of the local community, and other local factors.

In [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] Christmas is celebrated on January 7. This is a result of their [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches marking Christmas Day based on the [[Julian calendar]], which is now 13&amp;nbsp;days behind the internationally used Gregorian calendar.

===== Spain =====

[[File:Spain.Barcelona.Porta.Angel.Navidad.jpg|thumb|Avinguda Portal de l'Ãngel, at Christmas time, [[Barcelona]], Spain]]
Christmas and St Stephen's Day are [[Public holidays in Spain|officially recognized holidays in Spain]]. In most of Spain, the Christmas period, referred to as "Navidad", lasts from Christmas Eve referred to as "Nochebuena" or "the Good Night." on December 24 to Epiphany on January 6. Many homes and most churches display a [[Nativity scene]], a [[Christmas tree]], or both. The ''pesebre'' (nativity scene) is present in many homes, schools and stores. On the 26th, ''Sant Esteve'' (Saint Stephen) is celebrated with a family gathering.

A large family dinner is celebrated on Christmas Eve (Nochebuena) and can last until 6&amp;nbsp;o'clock in the morning. There is a wide variety of typical foods one might find on plates across Spain on this particular night, and each [[Regional food|region]] has its own distinct specialities. It is particularly common, however, to start the meal with a seafood dish such as prawns or salmon, followed by a bowl of hot, homemade soup. The main meal will commonly consist of [[Lamb (food)|roast lamb]], or seafood, such as cod or shellfish. For dessert, there is quite a spread of delicacies, among them are [[turrÃ³n]], a dessert made of honey, egg and almonds that is Arabic in origin. Special dishes and desserts include Mariscos y Pescado (shellfish and fish), [[marzipan]], Pavo Trufado de Navidad (turkey with [[truffles]]), and [[polvorones]] (shortbread made of almonds, flour and sugar).

Even though there is still the traditional [[Misa del Gallo]] at midnight, few Spaniards continue to follow the old custom of attending.

Children usually receive one or two presents on Christmas Day (December 25), brought by "PapÃ¡ Noel" (Father Noel), which is a non-traditional imitation of the American Santa Claus, but in some regions there are other more traditional characters, for example, the [[Olentzero]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. There is a special Christmas dance called the Jota which has been performed for centuries in Spain during Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santas.net/spanishchristmas.htm|title=Christmas Traditions in Spain,|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 31 (Nochevieja) there is also a large family feast. Some young people go out in "cotillÃ³n", a very big feast in bars and pubs and the drink and dance until January 1 morning, when they have [[Churros|churros with chocolate]] for breakfast. On January 5 a huge parade (La Cabalgata or [[cavalcade]]) welcomes the Three Kings to the city. Children put their shoes in the window on January 5 in the hope that the Three Wise Men will deliver them presents.&lt;ref&gt;''Christmas.'' World Book Encyclopedia 2003 edition. Volume Ch.

The french word for Christmas is noel Volume "Ch" P. 530&lt;/ref&gt; is celebrated mainly in a religious manner, though secular ways of celebrating the occasion also exist, such as Christmas decorations and carols. Children do not hang Christmas stockings but put their shoes by the fireplace or under the Christmas tree so ''PÃ¨re NoÃ«l'' (Father Christmas or Santa Claus) can give them gifts (a practice also among [[Romandy|French-speaking Switzerland]]). Some families also attend midnight mass and decorate their homes with Nativity Scenes depicting the birth of Jesus. Additional ''Santons'' (little saints) may be added in the nativity scenes.

In France and in other [[francophone|French-speaking]] areas (see French Canada), a long family dinner, called a ''[[rÃ©veillon]]'', is held on Christmas Eve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Noel/angl/reveilon.htm |title=RÃ©veillon |publisher=VirtualMuseum.ca |date=December 1, 1995 |accessdate=December 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010523234250/http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Noel/angl/reveilon.htm |archivedate=May 23, 2001 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of this dinner is based on the word ''rÃ©veil'' (meaning "waking"), because participation involves staying awake until midnight and beyond. RÃ©veillon is generally of an exceptional or luxurious nature. [[Appetizer]]s may include [[lobster]], [[oyster]]s, [[escargot]]s or [[foie gras]], etc. One traditional dish is [[Turkey (food)|turkey]] with [[chestnut]]s. RÃ©veillons in [[Quebec]] will often include some variety of [[tourtiÃ¨re]]. Dessert may consist of a ''[[bÃ»che de NoÃ«l]]''. In [[Provence]], the tradition of the ''13 desserts'' is followed, almost invariably including: ''pompe Ã  l'huile'' (a flavoured bread), [[date (fruit)|date]]s, etc. Quality wine is usually consumed at such dinners, often with [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] or similar [[sparkling wine]]s as a conclusion. Christmas carols may also be sung.

===== United Kingdom =====

[[File:Trafalgar Square Christmas Carols - Dec 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Christmas Tree and carolers at [[Trafalgar Square]] in London]]
In the United Kingdom Christmas decorations are put up in shops and town centres from early November. Many towns and cities have a public event involving a local or regional celebrity to mark the switching on of Christmas lights. Decorations in people's homes are commonly put up from early December, traditionally including a Christmas tree, cards, and lights both inside and outside the home. Every year, Norway donates a giant Christmas tree for the British to raise in Trafalgar Square as a thank you for helping during the [[Second World War]]. Christmas carolers at [[Trafalgar Square]] in London sing around the tree on various evenings up until Christmas Eve and Christmas decorations are traditionally left up until the evening of January 5 (the night before Epiphany); it is considered bad luck to have Christmas decorations up after this date. In practice, many Christmas traditions, such as the playing of Christmas music, largely stop after Christmas Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Woodlands-Junior.Kent.sch.uk|url=http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/xmas/|title=British Christmas: introduction, food, customs|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220220018/http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/xmas/|archivedate=February 20, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mince pie]]s are traditionally sold during the festive season and are a popular food for Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projectbritain.com/Xmas/dinner.html|title=Christmas dinner|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common in many UK households for children and adults to put up advent calendars in their homes, which may either contain chocolates or Christmas scenes behind their doors.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

A common feature of the Christmas season is the Nativity play which is practiced in most primary and some secondary schools across the UK. This practice is becoming less common, and Christmas pantomimes may be performed instead.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Midnight Mass is also celebrated by Anglicans, Catholics, and other denominations, and services take place in nearly all Church of England parishes on Christmas Eve.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

On Christmas Eve, presents are supposedly delivered in stockings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projectbritain.com/Xmas/day.html|title=Project Britain Christmas|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and under the Christmas tree by [[Father Christmas]], who previously had been something like [[The Ghost of Christmas Present]] in Charles Dickens' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' (1843), but who has now become mainly conflated with [[Santa Claus]]. The two names are now used interchangeably and are equally known to British people, though some distinctive features still remain. Many families tell their children stories about Father Christmas and his reindeer. One tradition is to put out a plate of carrots for the reindeer, and [[mince pie]]s and sherry for Father Christmas to help him on his way.

The majority of families open their presents on the morning of Christmas Day, the [[Royal family]] being a notable exception, as they open their gifts on Christmas Eve, following German tradition introduced by the [[Hanoverians]]. [[Queen Victoria]] as a child made note of it in her diary for Christmas Eve 1832; the delighted 13-year-old princess wrote, "After dinner&amp;nbsp;... we then went into the drawing-room near the dining-room&amp;nbsp;... There were two large round tables on which were placed two trees hung with lights and sugar ornaments. All the presents being placed round the trees..".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The girlhood of [[Queen Victoria]]: a selection from Her Majesty's diaries|page=61|publisher= Longmans, Green &amp; Co./University of Wisconsin|date= 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first commercial [[Christmas card]] was produced in London in 1843, cards are sent in the weeks leading up to Christmas, many of which contain the English festive greeting ''[[Merry Christmas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Buday, GyÃ¶rgy &amp; Buday, George |date=1992|title=The history of the Christmas card|page=8|publisher= Omnigraphics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Christmas Day, a [[Public holidays in the United Kingdom|public holiday in the United Kingdom]], nearly the whole population has the day off to be with their family and friends, so they can gather round for a traditional [[Christmas dinner]], traditionally comprising a [[domestic turkey|turkey]] with cranberries, brussels sprouts, parsnips, [[Yorkshire pudding]] and roast potatoes, quite like the [[Sunday roast]], and followed by a [[Christmas pudding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Davis, Karen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NxHN2RKmI3gC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=Turkey+-+Christmas+16th+century+England&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=srEXTYDwMJGzhAfpk-S2Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Turkey%20-%20Christmas%2016th%20century%20England&amp;f=false |title=More than a meal: the turkey in history, myth, ritual, and reality|publisher= Lantern Books|date= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icons.org.uk/nom/nominations/christmas-pudding-1|title=Christmas pudding: Icons of England|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316042429/http://www.icons.org.uk/nom/nominations/christmas-pudding-1|archivedate=March 16, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the meal, [[Christmas crackers]], containing toys, jokes, and a paper hat are pulled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kimpton, Peter |title=Tom Smith's Christmas crackers: an illustrated history|publisher= Tempus|date= 2005|isbn= 0-7524-3164-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance at a Christmas Day [[church service]] has become less popular in modern times, with fewer than 3&amp;nbsp;million now attending a Christmas Day Church of England service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkinganglicans.org.uk/archives/004185.html |title=Church of England statistics |last=Owen |first=Peter |publisher=Thinking Anglicans |date=January 22, 2010 |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watching the [[Royal Christmas Message|Queen's Speech]] on TV is a tradition that can be important in many households on Christmas Day, typically averaging 7&amp;nbsp;million viewers and sometimes being the most watched show of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42484128 |title=Christmas Day TV: Queen's message wins TV ratings battle |publisher=BBC News |date=2017-12-26 |accessdate=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Celebration of [[Boxing Day]], on the day after Christmas Day, is a tradition practiced in the UK. It is a [[bank holiday]], and if it happens to fall on a weekend then a special [[Bank Holiday Monday]] will occur. Also, depending on the day of the week, it is often a day when football matches are played in the professional leagues and many people go to watch their team play.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Other traditions include carol singing â many carols are sung by children on people's doorsteps and by professional choirs â and sending Christmas cards. In public, there are decorations and lights in most shops, especially in town centres, and even in Indian and Chinese restaurants. Churches and [[cathedral]]s across the country hold masses, with many people going to midnight mass or a service on Christmas morning. Even though church attendance has been falling over the decades some people who do not go to church often think it is still important to go at Christmas, so Church attendance increases. Most theatres have a tradition of putting on a Christmas [[pantomime]] for children. The pantomime stories are traditionally based on popular children's stories such as ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'' and ''[[Aladdin]]'', rather than being directly concerned with Christmas as such, although there is sometimes a link. Television is widely watched: for many television channels, Christmas Day is the most important day of the year in terms of ratings.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In England, telling ghost stories, local legends, and other strange, bizarre, and fantastic "winter stories" (as Charles Dickens â author of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' -termed them) is a centuries-old tradition, to which [[Shakespeare|William Shakespeare]] contributed with ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' (1623) but which was well known even before Shakespeare's time.

Christmas in Scotland was traditionally observed very quietly, because the [[Church of Scotland]] â a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] Church â for various reasons never placed much emphasis on the Christmas festival; although in Catholic areas people would attend Midnight Mass or early morning Mass before going to work.&lt;ref name="Scottish Christmas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santas.net/scottishchristmas.htm|title=Scottish Christmas|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition derives from the Church of Scotland's origins including St Columba's monastic tradition, under which every day is God's day and there is none more special than another.

The gift-giving, public holidays and feasting associated with mid-winter were traditionally held between December 11 and January 6. However, since the 1980s, the fading of the Church's influence and the increased influences from the rest of the UK and elsewhere, Christmas and its related festivities are now nearly on a par with Hogmanay and "[[New Year's Day|Ne'erday]]". The capital city of [[Edinburgh]] now has a traditional German [[Christmas market]] from late November until Christmas Eve and on the first Sunday in Advent a nativity scene is blessed by the Cardinal Archbishop in the main square.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edinburghschristmas.com/event/Events/2794/ "Traditional German Christmas Market"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213034644/http://www.edinburghschristmas.com/event/Events/2794 |date=December 13, 2011 }} Edinburgh's Christmas.

Christmas in Ireland is the largest celebration on the [[Public holidays in the Republic of Ireland|calendar in Ireland]] and lasts from December 24 to January 6, although many view December 8 as being the start of the season; and schools used to close on this day, making it a traditional Christmas shopping time, this is no longer compulsory and many stay open.

Almost the entire workforce is finished by lunchtime on Christmas Eve, or often a few days beforehand. Christmas Day and St. Stephen's Day are public holidays, and many people do not return to work until after New Year's Day. Irish people spend more and more money each year on celebrating Christmas. In 2006, the total amount spent in Ireland to celebrate Christmas was â¬16&amp;nbsp;billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/index.php3?ca=43&amp;issue_id=11790 |title=News Ireland &amp;#124; Irish News Paper &amp;#124; Free News Stories Online from The Irish Independent Newspaper â Independent.ie |last=Black |first=Rebecca |publisher=Unison.ie |accessdate=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which averages at approximately â¬4,000 for every single person in the country.

It is extremely popular on Christmas Eve to go for "the Christmas drink" in the local pub, where regular punters are usually offered a Christmas drink. Many neighbours and friends attend each other's houses for Christmas drinks and parties on the days leading up to and after Christmas Day. Although religious devotion in Ireland today is considerably less than it used to be, there are huge attendances at religious services for Christmas Day, with Midnight Mass a popular choice. Most families arrange for their deceased relatives to be prayed for at these Masses as it is a time of remembering the dead in Ireland. It is traditional to decorate graves at Christmas with a wreath made of holly and ivy. Even in the most undevout of homes in Ireland the traditional crib takes centre stage along with the Christmas tree as part of the family's decorations. Some people light candles to signify symbolic hospitality for [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]. Therefore, it is usual to see a white candle, or candle set, placed in several windows around people's homes. The candle was a way of saying there was room for [[Jesus]]'s parents in these homes even if there was none in [[Bethlehem]].&lt;ref name="CID"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christmasindublin.com/traditions.html |title=Irish Christmas Traditions |publisher=ChristmasinDublin.com |accessdate=December 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030810083446/http://christmasindublin.com/Traditions.html |archivedate=August 10, 2003 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is traditional to leave a [[mince pie]] and a bottle or a glass of [[Guinness]] for [[Santa Claus]] along with a carrot for [[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer|Rudolph]] on Christmas Eve.

Santa Claus, often known in Ireland simply as Santy or ''DaidÃ­ na Nollag'' in [[Irish language|Irish]], brings presents to children in Ireland, which are opened on Christmas morning. Family and friends also give each other gifts at Christmas. The traditional Christmas dinner consists of turkey or goose and ham with a selection of vegetables and a variety of potatoes, as potatoes still act as a staple food in Ireland despite the popularisation of staples such as rice and pasta. Dessert is a very rich selection of Christmas pudding, Christmas cake, and mince pies with equally rich sauces such as brandy butter.

Christmas celebrations in Ireland finish with the celebration of [[Little Christmas]] also known as OÃ­che Nollaig na mBan in Irish on January 6. This festival, which coincides with Epiphany, is also known as ''Women's Christmas'' in [[County Cork|Cork]] &amp; [[County Kerry|Kerry]].

===== Netherlands and Flanders =====

Christmas traditions in the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/holland.shtml|title=Christmas in Holland / The Netherlands|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; are almost the same as the ones in Dutch speaking parts of Belgium (Flanders). The Dutch recognize two days of Christmas as public holidays in the Netherlands, calling December 25 Eerste Kerstdag ("first Christmas day") and December 26 Tweede Kerstdag ("second Christmas day"). In families, it is customary to spend these days with either side of the family.

In Catholic parts of the country, it used to be common to attend Christmas Eve midnight mass; this custom is upheld, but mostly by the elder generation and by fewer people every year. Christmas Eve is these days a rather normal evening without any special gatherings or meals. On Christmas Day, throughout both Flanders and the Netherlands elaborated meals are prepared by the host or together as a family. Also meals of which every participant / guest is preparing one dish are very common. The week before Christmas is important to the retail trade, because this is the biggest sales week in the country. Christmas songs are heard everywhere. The cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Eindhoven are the busiest cities in terms of entertainment on Christmas Day. Many people do not exchange gifts on Christmas, since this is already done during a separate holiday ([[Sinterklaas]]) a few weeks before Christmas. In [[Twente]] people will blow the mid-winter horns around Christmas.

The Christmas season wraps up after the new year with Epiphany, or "Driekoningen". On January 6 children especially in the north of the Netherlands dress up as the Three Wise Men and travel in groups of three carrying lanterns, re-enacting the Epiphany and singing traditional songs for their hosts. In return they are rewarded with cakes and sweets. This practice is less common south of the great rivers. In the south and east of the Netherlands it is common practice to burn the Christmas trees of the community on a big pile on January 6 to celebrate the end of Christmas and the start of the new year.

In Australia, as with all of the Southern Hemisphere, Christmas occurs during the height of the summer season. Christmas Day and Boxing Day (December 25â26) are recognized as [[Public holidays in Australia|national public holidays in Australia]], and workers are therefore entitled to a day off with pay.

The Australian traditions and decorations are quite similar to those of the United Kingdom and North America, and similar wintry iconography is commonplace. This means a red fur-coated Santa Claus riding a sleigh, carols such as ''Jingle Bells'', and various snow-covered Christmas scenes on Christmas cards and decorations appear in the middle of summer. As novelties, some Australian songwriters and authors have occasionally depicted Santa in "Australian"-style clothing including an [[Akubra]] hat, with warm-weather clothing and [[flip-flops|thongs]], and riding in a [[Ute (vehicle)|ute]] pulled by [[kangaroo]]s, (e.g. ''Six White Boomers'' by [[Rolf Harris]]) but these depictions have not replaced mainstream iconography.

Christmas Day and Boxing Day are both [[Public holidays in New Zealand|statutory holidays in New Zealand]]. While Boxing Day is a standard statutory holiday, Christmas Day is one of the three-and-a-half days of the year where all but the most essential businesses and services must close. Many of New Zealand's Christmas traditions are similar to those of Australia in that they are a mix of United Kingdom traditions conducted in summer. New Zealand celebrates Christmas with very little traditional northern hemisphere winter imagery, mixed with local imagery. The [[Metrosideros excelsa|pohutukawa]] (''Metrosideros excelsa''), which produces large crimson flowers in December, is an often used symbol for Christmas in New Zealand, and subsequently the pohutukawa has become known as the ''New Zealand Christmas tree''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/pohutukawa-flowers |title=Pohutukawa trees |publisher=Ministry of Culture and Heritage (New Zealand) |accessdate=September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed span|1=For the Christmas gift-bringer's name, New Zealand uses a variety of names, from Father Christmas to Saint Nick.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25183">'''Community fingerprinting''' is a set of [[molecular biology]] techniques that can be used to quickly profile the [[biodiversity|diversity]] of a [[microorganism|microbial]] community. Rather than directly identifying or counting individual cells in an environmental sample, these techniques show how many variants of a [[gene]] are present. In general, it is assumed that each different gene variant represents a different type of microbe. Community fingerprinting is used by [[microbiologist]]s studying a variety of microbial systems (e.g. marine, freshwater, soil, and human microbial communities) to measure biodiversity or track changes in community structure over time. The method analyzes environmental samples by assaying genomic [[DNA]]. This approach offers an alternative to [[microbiological culture|microbial culturing]], which is important because most microbes cannot be cultured in the laboratory.&lt;ref name="Madigan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Madigan|first=M.T.|title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=San Francisco, CA|edition=12th |author2=J.M. Martinko |author3=P.V. Dunlap |author4=D.P. Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community fingerprinting does not result in identification of individual microbe species; instead, it presents an overall picture of a microbial community.  These methods are now largely being replaced by high throughput sequencing, such as targeted [[microbiome]] analysis (e.g., 16s rRNA sequencing) and [[metagenomics]].

==Use==
A fingerprinting analysis begins with an environmental sample (e.g. seawater or soil), from which total DNA is extracted. (Total DNA contains a mix of genetic material from all the microbes present in the sample.) A particular gene or DNA region is then selected as a target for analysis, under the assumption that each microbe species will have a different gene variant (also called a "[[phylotype]]"). Different methods (see below) can be used to visualize the phylotypes present in a sample. Because the aim of community fingerprinting is to gain an overall understanding of community structure, it is a particularly useful technique for analyzing [[Time series|time-series]] data collected from the field. For example, one could study the pattern of microbial [[ecological succession|succession]] in a habitat, or one could examine the response of a microbial community to an environmental perturbation, such as the release of a pollutant. Depending on what information is desired, different genes may be targeted. The most common are small subunit [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) genes, such as [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]]. These genes are frequently used in microbial [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analyses, so well-established techniques exist for their study. Other genes of interest might be those that are key in various metabolic processes.&lt;ref name="Madigan" /&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The advantages of community fingerprinting are that it can be performed quickly and relatively cheaply, and the analyses can accommodate a large number of samples simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Marsh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsh|first=T.L.|title=Culture-independent microbial community analysis with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism|journal=Methods in Enzymology|year=2005|volume=397|pages=308â329|doi=10.1016/s0076-6879(05)97018-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=A.|author2=L.A. Ogilvie|title=Name that microbe: rapid identification of taxa responsible for individual fragments in fingerprints of microbial community structure|journal=Molecular Ecology Notes|year=2004|volume=4|issue=1|pages=133â136|doi=10.1111/j.1471-8286.2004.00590.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These properties make community fingerprinting especially useful for monitoring changes in microbial communities over time. Also, fingerprinting techniques do not require one to have ''a priori'' sequence data for organisms in a sample.

==Techniques==
This section presents three methods of community fingerprinting.

===Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP)===

[[Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (T-RFLP) is a method that uses [[fluorescence|fluorescently]]-labeled DNA fragments to produce a community fingerprint.&lt;ref name="Marsh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=W.-T. |author2=T. L. Marsh |author3=H. Cheng |author4=L.J. Forney|title=Characterization of microbial  diversity by determining terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms of genes  encoding 16S rRNA|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=1997|volume=63|issue=11|pages=4517â4522}}&lt;/ref&gt; This section presents a brief explanation of T-RFLP ''in the specific context of community fingerprinting''. For a more detailed explanation, refer to the [[Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism|T-RFLP]] article.

====Procedure====
To perform T-RFLP (Figure 1), one must select a target gene (e.g. the 16S rRNA gene) to amplify by [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]. At least one [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]] used in the PCR reaction is fluorescently labeled at the [[directionality (molecular biology)|5Â´]] end. After PCR amplification, each copied DNA segment carries the fluorescent label. Next, [[restriction enzyme]]s are used to cut the amplified DNA at specific [[recognition site]]s. The underlying assumption is that each microbe in the sample will have a different sequence on the target gene, so a restriction enzyme will cut each microbe's DNA in a different place. (Each different restriction site is considered to represent a single [[operational taxonomic unit]] [OTU]). Thus, the enzyme will produce one fragment length for each type of microbe present in the sample. The result of digestion is a set of restriction fragments of different lengths, each of which is fluorescently labeled at one end. These are known as "terminal fragments" because they are labeled at the end where the PCR primer attached.  (The unlabeled ends are not recorded in the final analysis.) Next, the fragments are separated by size through either [[gel electrophoresis|gel]] or [[capillary electrophoresis]]. Laser detection captures the size and fluorescence-intensity patterns of the terminal fragments. DNA standards of known size and fluorescence are included in the analysis as references. By setting a minimum threshold for fluorescence, background noise will be excluded.&lt;ref name="Osborn" /&gt;
[[File:Step-by-step procedure of using T-RFLP analysis in microbiology.pdf|thumb|right|Figure 1. Steps of Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis for a single microbial community with 3 phylotypes]]

====Data output and interpretation====
The output of the laser detection step is an [[electropherogram]] that shows a series of peaks, with fragment length on the horizontal axis and fluorescence intensity on the vertical axis (Figure 1). A second output&lt;ref name="Osborn" /&gt; is a data table that lists the migration time of the fragments, the size in [[base pairs]] of each peak, and the height of and area under each peak.

The theoretical basis of T-RFLP assumes that peaks at different positions along the horizontal axis represent different types of organisms (or OTUs). The area under each fluorescence intensity peak is a proxy for relative abundance of each phylotype in the community. However, a number of caveats must be taken into account. Different types of organisms may share a restriction site in the gene of interest; if that is the case, these organisms would not be distinguished as different peaks on the electropherogram. Furthermore, area under a peak represents relative abundance rather than absolute abundance, and there are biases in abundance measurement and PCR amplification. For example, organisms that are scarce in the original total DNA sample will not be amplified enough to be detected in the final analysis.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt; This leads to underestimation of community diversity. Liu ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt; cite other possible factors that may distort results, including "differences in gene copy number between species and biases introduced during cell lysis, DNA extraction, and PCR amplification" (p.&amp;nbsp;4521). For those who seek detailed technical information, Marsh&lt;ref name="Marsh" /&gt; provides a catalog of potential biases that could be introduced in each step of the T-RFLP process.

====Advantages and disadvantages{{anchor|Advantages and disadvantages of T-RFLP}}====
The major advantages of T-RFLP are that it is fast and can easily accommodate many samples.&lt;ref name="Marsh" /&gt; Also, the visual output simplifies comparison of community structure patterns across different samples. A disadvantage is the broad, qualitative nature of the data output, which must be interpreted with the above caveats in mind. Also, direct identification of microbes in a sample is not possible through T-RFLP.

Chantawannakul|title=T-RFLP  analysis of bacterial communities in the midguts of ''Apis mellifera'' and ''Apis cerana'' honey  bees in Thailand|journal=FEMS Microbiology Ecology|year=2012|volume=79|pages=273â281|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6941.2011.01216.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; used T-RFLP to assess the microbial gut community, or microbiome, in two species of honeybees in Thailand. They found that the two species harbor different microbial communities and that the microbiome changes over the lifetime of the bees.

Joo ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Joo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joo|first=S. |author2=S.-R. Lee |author3=S. Park |title=Monitoring of phytoplankton community structure using  terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP)|journal=Journal of Microbiological Methods|year=2010|volume=81|pages=61â68|doi=10.1016/j.mimet.2010.01.025}}&lt;/ref&gt;  tested T-RFLP as a method for phytoplankton monitoring. The authors collected environmental water samples from reservoirs in a time series. After comparison of samples with known terminal restriction fragments (from a database built from cultures), they concluded that T-RFLP can be used effectively as a technique for monitoring ''changes'' in the phytoplankton community. However, diversity and abundance estimates were found to be less accurate than those found through other methods.

===Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)===

====Procedure====
[[Dgge|Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)]] is a microbial fingerprinting technique that separates [[amplicon]]s of roughly the same size based on sequence properties&lt;ref name="Madigan" /&gt; (Figure 2). These properties dictate the threshold at which DNA denatures. The DGGE gel uses a gradient DNA denaturant (a mixture of urea and formamide), or a linear temperature gradient.&lt;ref name=Muyzer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muyzer|first=G.|title=DGGE/TGGE a method for identifying genes from natural ecosystems|journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology|year=1999|volume=2|pages=317â322|doi=10.1016/s1369-5274(99)80055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the fragment reaches its melting point (threshold of enough denaturant), it stops moving. This is due to the fact that a partially melted double-stranded DNA can no longer migrate through the gel.&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=S.G.|author2=L.S. Lerman|title=DNA fragments differing by single base-pair substitutions are separated in denaturing electrophoreseis analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified genes coding for 16S rRN|journal=PNAS|year=1983|volume=80|number=6|pages=1579â1583|doi= 10.1073/pnas.80.6.1579 |pmc=393645}}&lt;/ref&gt; A GC clamp (about 40 bases with high GC content) is used as a special [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] to anchor the [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] fragments together once they have [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]].&lt;ref name=Rettedal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rettedal|first=E.A.|author2=S.

[[File:Step-by-step procedure of using DGGE analysis in microbiology.pdf|thumb|right|Figure 2. The microbial fingerprinting technique called Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis. The diagram demonstrates how samples from different microbial communities can be compared.]]

====Data output and interpretation====
Each lane on a gel represents one microbial community. The shared bands among the samples are the same size and roughly the same position on the gel. The gene variants that are not shared amongst microbial community samples do not match up horizontally with others. For example, if the gene of interest is 16S rRNA, as it was when the technique was first described, the PCR-amplified fragments will be in the same vertical location because they are all roughly the same size.&lt;ref name=Muyzer2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muyzer|first=G. |author2=E.C. De Waal |author3=A.G. Uitterlinden |title=Profiling of complex microbial populations by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified genes coding for 16S rRN|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=1993|volume=59|pages=695â700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another target gene may have greater variation in length, but the denaturant gradient uses a second element (of melting point) to further distinguish between the samples. The DGGE gel will separate genes of the same size based on base sequence.

This technique shows to what extent microbial communities are the same or different in taxonomic composition. Each band in a different location on the gel represents a different phylotype (one unique sequence of a phylogenetic marker gene).&lt;ref name="Madigan" /&gt; For microbial communities this method profiles many individual 16S rRNA sequences.&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ward|first=D.M.|author2=M. J. Ferris |author3=S. C. Nold |author4=M. M. Bateson |title=A natural view of microbial biodiversity within hot spring cyanobacterial mat communities|journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews|year=1998|volume=62|pages=1353â1370|pmid=9841675 |pmc=98949}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of bands at differing horizontal positions can be used to estimate the level of biodiversity in that sample and infer phylogenetic affiliation.&lt;ref name="Muyzer" /&gt; In order to know more about phylogenetic affiliation, one could excise those bands from the gel and then sequence them.

====Advantages and disadvantages{{anchor|Advantages and disadvantages of DGGE}}====
The use of denaturing profile serves as a way to separate DNA fragments of similar sizes. This is beneficial in assessing microbial diversity due to the fact that the 16S rRNA gene does not vary much in size across bacterial phyla. The DGGE gel provides a quick way of looking at biodiversity in a microbial sample and does not preclude the option of sequencing the bands of interest. This method does not require that the microbes be cultured in the lab and does not require any sequence data needed to design probes for hybridization methods.&lt;ref name="Muyzer" /&gt; The main disadvantage is that this is a qualitative assessment of biodiversity and one must sequence the genes in order to make inferences about the phylogenetic relatedness. Another disadvantage is that the GC clamp can be variable each time it is synthesized. This leads to the potential for different DGGE profiles for the same 16S rRNA sequence.&lt;ref name="Rettedal" /&gt;

====Applications{{anchor|Applications of DGGE}}====
Stephen ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Stephen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stephen|first=J.R. |author2=G. A. Kowalchuk |author3=M-A. V. Bruns |author4=A. E. McCaig |author5=C. J. Phillips |author6=T. M. Embley |author7=J. I. Prosse |title=Analysis of Î²-subgroup Proteobacterial ammonia oxidizer populations in soil by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis and hierarchical phylogenetic probing|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=1998|volume=64|pages=2958â2965}}&lt;/ref&gt; utilized DGGE for a rapid analysis of Proteobacteria in soil. They obtained an initial assessment of microbial diversity in their environmental samples from soil maintained for 36 years at the various pH values. They combined DGGE and hybridization techniques by probing the DNA fragments to obtain more detail about the natural populations. In this study, they were looking at a group of closely related bacterial types, all autotrophic Î²âproteobacterial ammonia oxidizers. The 16S rDNA samples yielded ambiguous overlapping bands when run out on a gel. The ambiguous overlapping bands were separated with cluster-specific radiolabelled probes, which yielded information of the relative abundance of the different genotypes in samples.

Ward ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Ward" /&gt; examined cyanobacterial mat communities in a Yellowstone hot spring by using DGGE analysis of 16S rRNA gene segments of aerobic chemoorganotrophic populations. DGGE allowed them to profile the community gaining new insight to diversity. They characterized the bands of interest by purifying and sequencing and detected many lineages previously unknown to be present.

===(Automated) ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) ===

====Procedure====

(Automated) [[ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis]], or (A)RISA (Figure 3), takes advantage of the fact that prokaryotic DNA encodes for two highly conserved genes, the 16SrRNA gene and the 23SrRNA gene. These encode the small and large subunit genes in the rRNA operon. Between these two genes, there is an internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Due to the fact it is non-coding for proteins, it is a highly variable nucleotide sequence and length. Once DNA is isolated from a community, PCR amplifies this spacer region. The fragments can be run out on a gel (RISA), or the fluorescent primers can be translated into peaks in abundance of the different fragments lengths on an [[electropherogram]] (ARISA).&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=M.M.|author2=E.W. Triplett|title=Automated approach for ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis of microbial diversity and its application to freshwater bacterial communities|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=1999|volume=65|pages=4630â4636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ranjard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranjard|first=L. |author2=F.

====Data output and interpretation====
Due to variable non-coding regions, the output for RISA is a gel with different banding patterns, and output for ARISA is an electropherogram  with different peaks (similar to T-RFLP).

The brightness of the fluorescently labeled primers correlates to how prevalent that bacterial type is in the community. The banding pattern on the gel can be interpreted as a community-specific profile. Each DNA band or peak indicates at least one representative of that organism.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt; In RISA, the bands on gel that do not match up in length represent different organisms in the community because they have different spacer regions between the two highly conserved genes. The electropherogram shows peaks correlating to the relative abundance of that spacer region in the sample.

====Advantages and disadvantages{{anchor|Advantages and disadvantages of ARISA}}====
ARISA can have a higher resolution in detecting microbial diversity as compared to [[Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism|T-RFLP]].&lt;ref name=Danovaro&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danovaro|first=R. |author2=G. M. Luna |author3=A. DellâAnno |author4=B. Pietrangeli|title=Comparison of two fingerprinting techniques, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis, for determination of bacterial diversity in aquatic environments|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=2006|volume=72|pages=5982â5989|doi=10.1128/aem.01361-06 |pmid=16957219 |pmc=1563681}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fingerprinting method is a quick and sensitive method to estimate microbial diversity. The observed length heterogeneities can be compared to databases for overlap with culturable organisms.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt; One can design phylum-level oligonucleotide primers to get at questions regarding phylogenetic groups.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt; One disadvantage to ARISA is the fact that a single organism may contribute more than one peak to the community profile. Unrelated organisms can also have similar spacer lengths, which leads to underestimates of community diversity. Due to these biases, researchers often use this method on multiple samples from each community in order to get an average assessment.

====Applications{{anchor|Applications of ARISA}}====
Ranjard ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Ranjard" /&gt; discuss several examples of types of studies in which RISA can be used. They cite several studies that have used this technique to fingerprint bacterial communities following such disturbances as antibiotic treatment, mercury stress and deforestation. They also demonstrated the successful use of ARISA for characterizing fungal communities, which is an aspect of microbial ecology that remains to be fully explored.

They used ARISA to profile the community structure and look at microbial succession over stages in the composting process. They took DNA samples and sequenced the 16S rRNA gene to identify community members at the different phases of the process. Then they used ARISA to look at community-wide changes and then matched up the 16S rRNA gene sequence with the most common ARISA fragments to identify these microbial community members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11851">'''Compurgation''', also called '''wager of law''' and '''oath-helping''', was a defence used primarily in medieval law.  A defendant could establish his innocence or nonliability by taking an [[oath]] and by getting a required number of persons, typically twelve, to swear they believed the defendant's oath. From Latin, ''com'' = with, ''purgare'' = make clean, cleanse, excuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.myetymology.com/english/compurgation.html |title=English etymology of compurgation |publisher=myEtymology.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Latin ''com'' is also an intensifier&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |editor-last = Delbridge |editor-first = A ||display-editors=etal |title = Macquarie Australia's National Dictionary |publisher = The Macquarie Library Pty |year = 1997 |page = 388}}&lt;/ref&gt; and turns a word into the superlative form, so compurgation, by etymology, means 'to thoroughly clean or excuse'.

The wager of law was essentially a character reference, initially by kin and later by neighbours (from the same region as the defendant), often 11 or 12 men, and it was a way to give credibility to the oath of a defendant at a time when a person's oath had more credibility than a written record.  It can be compared to [[legal wager]], which is the provision of surety at the beginning of legal action to minimize frivolous litigation.

Compurgation was found in [[early Germanic law]], in early French law (''trÃ¨s ancienne coutume de Bretagne''), in [[Welsh law]], and in the English [[ecclesiastical courts]] until the seventeenth century. In [[common law]] it was substantially abolished as a defence in [[felonies]] by the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]] in 1164. The defence was still permitted in [[civil action]]s for debt and vestiges of it survived until its statutory repeal at various times in common law countries: in England in 1833,&lt;ref name="Friedman" /&gt; and [[Queensland]] at some point before the Queensland Common Practice Act of 1867&lt;ref name="QCLPA"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/REPEALED/C/CommLawPracA1867_01_.pdf |format = PDF |title=Common Law Practice Act 1867 |publisher=Office of the Queensland Parliamentary Counsel |date=24 June 1994 |quote = Wager of law abolished â 3. No wager of law shall be allowed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes direct reference to the abolition of wager of law.

"Wager of Law, obsolete for centuries" was "a living fossil... a dead letter statute" and was repealed in England in 1833.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{citation |last=Friedman |first=Lawrence Meir

==Origins==
The procedure in a wager of law is traced by [[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Blackstone]] to the Mosaic law, Ex. xxii. 10; but it seems historically to have been derived from the system of compurgation, introduced into England from Normandy, a system which is now thought to have had an appreciable effect on the development of the English jury. It also has some points of resemblance, perhaps some historical connexion, with the sponsao and the decisory oath of Roman law, and the reference to oath of [[Scottish law]].&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911 229"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |mode=cs2|wstitle=Wager |volume=28 |page=229 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopdiabri28chis#page/229/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
[Compurgation] had originated in Anglo-Saxon England in the ties of kinship that bound people together in the period before the year 1000, a time when each man was responsible for the acts of his blood relatives. Later, kinship gave way to a more tribal affiliation and a loyalty to the place of one's birth. When disputes more often than not led to violence, it seemed natural that neighbors would band together. They aligned themselves with a neighbour who was accused in court and swore that in good conscience they believed he was telling the truth. The number of oath-helpers required depended on the defendant's rank and the character of the lawsuit. Eventually it became standard practice to bring eleven neighbours into court to swear for the defendant. The oath-helpers were called compurgators, and the wager of law was called compurgation.&lt;ref name="legal-dictionary"&gt;{{citation |url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Wager+of+law |title=Wager of law legal definition of Wager of law |publisher=Legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Wager of law, wager of battle and trial by ordeal==
The wager of law, also called compurgation, is an old legal practice, dating back to Saxon and feudal times, which was [[Contemporary history|contemporaneous]] to the appeal to God to prove fact by [[trial by battle]] (wager of battle, [[trial by combat]], or judicial duel), and of [[trial by ordeal]].&lt;ref name=hamowy&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj23n2/cj23n2-7.pdf |format=PDF |title=F. A. Hayek and the Common Law |first=Ronald |last=Hamowy
|journal=Cato Journal |volume=23 |issue=2 |date=Fall 2003 |publisher=Cato Institute |accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the oath instead of the real or feigned combat â [[Trial by combat#Great Britain and Ireland|real in English law]], feigned in Roman law â no doubt represents an advance in legal development. The technical term sacramentum is the bond of union between the two stages of law. In the wager of law the defendant, with eleven compurgators, appeared in court, and the defendant swore that he did not owe the debt, or (in detinue) that he did not detain the plaintiff's chattel; while the compurgators swore that they believed that he spoke the truth.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911 229"/&gt;

==Surety==
A variation was for the defendant to give gage, or sureties, in an action of debt, and "that at a certain day assigned he would take a law, or oath, in open court, that he did not owe the debt, and at the same time bring with him eleven neighbors (called compurgators), who should avow upon their oaths that they believed in their consciences that he spoke the truth" (see the [[Tractatus of Glanvill|''Tractatus'' of Glanvill]], ca. 1188).

==Determining fact==
Wager of law was replaced by jury, from early times, to determine fact, at a time that judges managed legal procedure and did not determine fact. Trial "by lawful Judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land (legus terrae)" Cap. 29 of the [[Magna Carta]] 1215 to 1297.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/magna_carta/translation.html |title=Featured Document: The Magna Carta |publisher=Archives.gov |date=|accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wager of law was practised in England (and English  American colonies) until the 16th century, in criminal matters, and the 19th century, in civil matters.

==Supporting defendant's oath==
A defendant who elected to "make his law" was permitted to make a statement before the court, swear an oath that it was true, and present one or more individuals, often 12, who swore that they believed he had told the truth under oath. The predominant form of defense in the feudal courts, it persisted for a time in the common-law courts. The individuals "did not testify about the fact itself and, indeed, might have no personal knowledge concerning it. The value of a manâs oath might vary with his status; sometimes it was necessary for a defendant to meet a charge by assembling oaths of a prescribed monetary value. Because oath making often had religious implications for those who served as oath helpers and because there was also a possibility of legal sanctions (penalties), individuals might refuse to give oaths for persons with bad reputations. One reason for the long survival of the practice was that 'wagers in law' were often considered better evidence than account books in cases of debt."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/130405/compurgation |title=compurgation |publisher=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Inc. |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Welsh law]] allowed for a form of compurgation called [[assach]], which required not 12 but 300 compurgators.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/LFBooks/Maitland0161/CollectedPapers/Vol1/HTMLs/0242-01_Pt03_Essays1.html|title=The Laws of Wales|work=The Collected Papers of Frederic William Maitland|author=Fisher, H.A.L.|authorlink = H.

==Abolition of wager of law==
{{quote|As the kings consolidated their power, suppressing violence and increasing the authority of the courts, the wager of law lost some of its ancient power and became a nuisance to litigants, who suspected that it frequently opened the door to false swearing. Different forms of action developed that did not permit the wager of law as a defense, and plaintiffs used them as much as possible. The procedure of wager of law had long since been obsolete when it was abolished during the reign of Henry IV (1399â1413).&lt;ref name="legal-dictionary"/&gt;}}

The taking of oaths was an eminently unsatisfactory way of arriving at the merits of a claim, and it is therefore not surprising to find that the policy of the law was in favour of its restriction rather than of its extension. Thus it was not permitted where the defendant was not a person of good character, where the king sued, where the defendant was the executor or administrator of the person alleged to have owed the debt, or in any form of action other than those named, even though the cause of action were the same.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911 229"/&gt;

Trial by ordeal was abolished by order of the Lateran Council of 1215. Trial by battle was abolished in 1819 and wager of law was abolished in 1833, although both had fallen into disuse before their formal abolition.&lt;ref name=hamowy/&gt;

Wager of law was used as late as 1829, when the Rev. Fearon Jenkinson of Gnosall, Staffordshire used it against a Stafford ironmonger who claimed he was owed money by him. Jenkinson and his compurgators did not appear on the date.&lt;ref&gt;Chester Chronicle, 5 June 1829.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wager of law survived to recent centuries and in many jurisdictions it has been abolished by statute. It was abolished in New South Wales in 1841 by the Advancement of Justice Act 1841 (both Victoria and Queensland were still part of New South Wales at this time). This was re-enacted after separation of Queensland from New South Wales in the Queensland Common Law Practice Act 1867, but was strictly unnecessary, given its earlier abolition in 1841 &lt;ref name="QCLPA" /&gt; which makes direct reference to the abolition of wager of law.

No wager of law was allowed in [[assumpsit]], even though the cause of action were a simple debt. This led to the general adoption of assumpsit â proceeding originally upon a fictitious averment of a promise by the defendant â as a means of recovering debts. Where a penalty was created by statute, it became a common form to insert a proviso that no wager of law was to be allowed in an action for the penalty. Wager of law was finally abolished in 1833 (3 &amp; 4 William IV. c. 42).&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911 229"/&gt;

It differs from traditional gene knockout because it targets specific genes at specific times rather than being deleted from beginning of life. Using the conditional gene knockout technique eliminates many of the side effects from traditional [[gene knockout]]. In traditional gene knockout, embryonic death from a gene [[mutation]] can occur, and this prevents scientists from studying the gene in adults. Some tissues cannot be studied properly in isolation, so the gene must be inactive in a certain tissue while remaining active in others. With this technology, scientists are able to knockout genes at a specific stage in development and study how the knockout of a gene in one tissue affects the same gene in other tissues.&lt;ref name="germline"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=Alan|title=Manipulating the germline: its impact on the study of carcinogenesis|journal=Carcinogenesis|date=21 March 2000|volume=21|issue=3|pages=435â441|pmid=10688863|doi=10.1093/carcin/21.3.435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cre"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Jian|last2=Zhao|first2=Jing|title=Conditional gene manipulation: Cre-ating a new biological era|journal=J Zheijang Univ Sci B|date=July 2012|volume=13|issue=7|pages=511â524|pmc=3390709|doi=10.1631/jzus.b1200042|pmid=22761243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
[[File:Conditional_Knockout_Mouse.jpg|frame|Diagram showing how to generate a conditional knockout mouse: A mouse containing the Cre gene and a mouse containing the lox gene were bred to generate a conditional knockout for a particular gene of interest. The mice do not naturally express Cre recombinase or lox sites, but they have been engineered to express these gene products to create the desirable offspring.]]
The most commonly used technique is the Cre-lox recombination system. The Cre recombinase enzyme specifically recognizes two lox (loci of recombination) sites within DNA and causes [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] between them. During recombination two strands of DNA exchange information. This recombination will cause a deletion or inversion of the genes between the two lox sites, depending on their orientation. An entire gene can be removed to inactivate it.&lt;ref name="zebrafish" /&gt;&lt;ref name="germline" /&gt; This whole system is inducible so a chemical can be added to knock genes out at a specific time. Two of the most commonly used chemicals are tetracycline, which activates transcription of the Cre recombinase gene and tamoxifen, which activates transport of the Cre recombinase protein to the nucleus.&lt;ref name="cre" /&gt; Only a few cell types express Cre recombinase and no mammalian cells express it so there is no risk of accidental activation of lox sites when using conditional gene knockout in mammals. Figuring out how to express Cre-recombinase in an organism tends to be the most difficult part of this technique.&lt;ref name="germline" /&gt;

==Uses==
The conditional gene knockout method is often used to model human diseases in other mammals.&lt;ref name="mouse" /&gt; It has increased scientistsâ ability to study diseases, such as cancer, that develop in specific cell types or developmental stages.&lt;ref name="cre" /&gt; It is known that mutations in the BRCA1 gene are linked to breast cancer. Scientists used conditional gene knockout to delete the BRCA1 [[allele]] in mammary gland tissue in mice and found that it plays an important role in tumour suppression.&lt;ref name="germline" /&gt;

A specific gene in mouse brain thought to be involved in the onset of [[Alzheimer's disease]] which codes for the enzyme [[cyclin-dependent kinase 5]] (Cdk5) was knocked out. Such mice were found to be 'smarter' than normal mice and were able to handle complex tasks more intelligently compared to 'normal' mice bred in the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Preclinical-Research/Increased-intelligence-through-genetic-engineering |title=Increased intelligence through genetic engineering |accessdate=2015-05-30 |date=2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP)==
Conditional gene knockouts in mice are often used to study human diseases because many genes produce similar phenotypes in both species. The goal of KOMP is to create knockout mutations in the embryonic stem cells for each of the 20,000 protein coding genes in mice.&lt;ref name="mouse" /&gt; The genes are knocked out because this is the best way to study their function and learn more about their role in human diseases. Some alleles in this project cannot be knocked out using traditional methods and require the specificity of the conditional gene knockout technique. Other combinatorial methods are needed to knockout the last remaining alleles. Conditional gene knockout is a time-consuming procedure and there are additional projects focusing on knocking out the remaining mouse genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guan|first1=Chunmei|last2=Ye|first2=Chao|last3=Yang|first3=Xiaomei|last4=Gao|first4=Jiangang|title=A Review of Current Large-Scale Mouse Knockout Efforts|journal=Genesis|date=2010|volume=48|issue=2|pages=73â85|doi=10.1002/dvg.20594|pmid=20095055}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KOMP projected was started in 2006 and is still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gondo|first1=Y|title=Trends in large-scale mouse mutagenesis: from genetics to functional genomics.|journal=Nat.

==Overview==
Unlike traditional engineering disciplines, engineering science/physics is not necessarily confined to a particular branch of science, engineering or physics. Instead, engineering science/physics is meant to provide a more thorough grounding in [[applied physics]] for a selected specialty such as [[optics]], [[quantum physics]], [[materials science]], [[applied mechanics]], [[electronics]], [[nanotechnology]], [[microfabrication]], [[microelectronics]], [[computing]], [[photonics]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[nuclear engineering]], [[biophysics]], [[control theory]], [[aerodynamics]], [[energy]], [[solid-state physics]], etc. It is the discipline devoted to creating and optimizing engineering solutions through enhanced understanding and integrated application of mathematical, scientific, statistical, and engineering principles. The discipline is also meant for cross-functionality and bridges the gap between theoretical science and practical engineering with emphasis in [[research]] and development, design, and analysis.

It is notable that in many languages the term for "engineering physics" would be directly translated into [[English language|English]] as "technical physics". In some countries, both what would be translated as "engineering physics" and what would be translated as "technical physics" are disciplines leading to academic degrees, with the former specializing in nuclear power research, and the latter closer to engineering physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cas.ac.cn/html/Dir/2001/10/07/0655.htm | title=2002 Applications for graduate study open in Shanghai Research Institute of Technical Physics (ä¸æµ·ææ¯ç©çç ç©¶æ2002å¹´æç) | publisher=Chinese Academy of Sciences (ä¸­å½ç§å­¦é¢) | date=2001-10-07 | accessdate=2008-09-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080607130833/http://www.cas.ac.cn/html/Dir/2001/10/07/0655.htm &lt;!--Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some institutions, an engineering (or applied) physics major is a discipline or specialization within the scope of engineering science, or applied science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eas.caltech.edu/ Division of Engineering and Applied Science, California Institute of Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://engsci.utoronto.ca/explore_our_program/majors/engineering_physics.htm Engineering Physics, Division of Engineering Science, University of Toronto]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beam.vt.edu/about/esm.php Engineering Science and Mechanics program at Virginia Tech]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many universities, engineering science programs may be offered at the levels of B.Tech, [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]], [[Master of Science|M.Sc.]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] Usually, a core of basic and advanced courses in [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[biology]] forms the foundation of the [[curriculum]], while typical elective areas may include [[fluid dynamics]], [[quantum physics]], [[economics]], [[plasma physics]], [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], [[solid mechanics]], [[operations research]], [[quantitative finance]], information technology and engineering, [[dynamical systems]], [[bioengineering]], [[environmental engineering]], computational engineering, engineering mathematics and [[statistics]], [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state device]]s, [[materials science]], [[electromagnetism]], [[nanoscience]], [[nanotechnology]], [[energy]], and [[optics]]. While typical undergraduate engineering programs generally focus on the application of established methods to the design and analysis of engineering solutions, undergraduate program in engineering science focuses on the creation and use of more advanced experimental or computational techniques where standard approaches are inadequate (i.e., development of engineering solutions to contemporary problems in the physical and life sciences by applying fundamental principles).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1627">Around 2006, the [[Government of China|Chinese Government]] instituted the admission of foreign students to [[China]] for medical instruction using [[English language|English]] as the language of instruction. Students are eligible to earn basic degrees in either Medicine ([[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MBBS]]) or Dentistry ([[Bachelor of Dental Surgery|BDS]]).

To ensure adequate quality control, only a few choice medical schools are allowed specific quotas for admitting international students into these programs. Other Chinese medical institutions are not barred from admitting international students, but the government maintains that these other students would have to be admitted into the medical programs taught in [[Chinese language|Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://202.205.177.9/english/tongzhi_070810.htm Interim provisions for Quality Control Standards on Undergraduate Medical Education in English for International Students in China]&lt;/ref&gt;

This list of universities is reviewed each year and currently{{when?|date=May 2018}} stands at 50 schools.

These schools are thus officially recognized by the [[Avicenna Directories|WHO]] and the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|MOE]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1913">An '''enhancer trap''' is a method in [[molecular biology]] that allows hijacking of an enhancer from another gene, and so, identification of [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]]. The enhancer trap construct contains a [[transposable element]] and a [[reporter gene]]. The first is necessary for (random) insertion in the genome, the latter is necessary for identification of the spatial regulation by the enhancer. On top of this, the construct usually includes a [[genetic marker]], e.g., the [[White (mutation)|white gene]] producing red-colored eyes in ''[[Drosophila]]'', or ampicillin resistance in ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''.

The most common and basic enhancer traps are: P&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[lacZ]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; from the [[bacterium]] ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' and P&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[GAL4/UAS system|GAL4]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; from [[yeast]]. There exists a large number of fly stocks containing GAL4 insertions and an equally large number of fly stocks containing an UAS DNA sequence followed by a gene of interest, which permits the expression of a large number of genes with different GAL4 "drivers".  Rather than generating transgenic flies with the enhancer linked directly to the gene of interest (which takes about a year, if you are starting without the appropriate DNA construct), you simply mate (cross) one transgenic fly with another transgenic fly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Brand]] and [[Norbert Perrimon]] (1993).

'''Environmental anthropology''' is a sub-specialty&lt;ref name="Kottak CP 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kottak|first1=Conrad P.|jstor=683339|title=The New Ecological Anthropology|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=101|pages=23|year=1999|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the field of anthropology that takes an active role in examining the relationships between humans and their environment across space and time.

== Philosophies ==

===Adaptation: environment over culture===
The sixties was a breakthrough decade for environmental anthropology, with functionalism and system theories prevalent throughout.&lt;ref name="Kottak CP 1999"/&gt; The rudiments of the system theories can be seen in [[Marcel Mauss]]' ''Seasonal Variation of Eskimo'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcel Mauss|title=''Seasonal variations of the Eskimo: a study in social morphology''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zRbl6DmN8vkC|accessdate=3 April 2011|date=30 April 2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-33035-0|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; echoed later in Julian Steward's work.&lt;ref&gt;Steward JH. 1938. The Great Basin Shoshonean Indians: An Example of A Family Level Of Sociocultural Integration. ''Environmental Anthropology: A Historical Read''. 168â180.
&lt;/ref&gt; Although later, system theories were later harshly criticized for narrowly assuming the state of societies as static.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vayda|first1=Andrew P.|author1-link=Andrew P. Vayda|last2=McCay|first2=Bonnie J.|author2-link= Bonnie McCay |title=New Directions in Ecology and Ecological Anthropology|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=4|pages=293|year=1975|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.04.100175.001453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main focus of system theories in the sixties, as conveyed by [[Julian Steward]],&lt;ref name="Steward JH 1955"&gt;Steward JH. 1955. Theory of Cultural Change: The Methodology of Multilinear Evolution. Urbana: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was acknowledgment of recurrence, cultural patterns or "laws." Steward's [[ecological anthropology]]&lt;ref name="Steward JH 1955"/&gt; was based on topography, climate, and resources and their accessibility to define culture. While [[Marvin Harris]]' cultural materialism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marvin Harris|title=Cultural materialism: the struggle for a science of culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Xc9DMbB5KQC|accessdate=3 April 2011|year=2001|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=978-0-7591-0135-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt; observed and gauged social units by means of material production. Both focused on culture as a malleable contingent to the environment; a social unit's characteristics (technology, politics, modes of subsistence, to name a few) have adaptive limitations. Importantly, those limitations are not considered determinants.

=== Diversity, history and associations ===
The new focus of environmental anthropology was cultural variation and diversity. Such factors like environmental disasters (floods, earthquakes, frost), migrations, cost &amp; benefit ratio, contact/ associations, external ideas (trade/ latent capitalism boom),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Richard B.|doi=10.1525/aa.1992.94.1.02a00030|title=Art, Science, or Politics?

This perspective was based on general equilibriums and criticized for not addressing the variety of responses an organisms can have, such as "loyalty, solidarity, friendliness, and sanctity" and possible "incentives or inhibitors" in relations to behavior.&lt;ref name="Biersack A 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biersack|first1=Aletta|title=Introduction: From the "New Ecology" to the New Ecologies|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=101|pages=5|year=1999|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rappaport, often referred to as a reductionist in his cultural studies methods,&lt;ref name="Biersack A 1999"/&gt; acknowledges, "The social unit is not always well defined&lt;ref name="Checker M 2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Melissa Checker|title=Polluted promises: environmental racism and the search for justice in a southern town|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GCcgMi40WkC|accessdate=3 April 2011|date=August 2005|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-1657-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;" exhibiting another flaw in this perspective, obfuscation of aspects of analyze and designated terms.&lt;ref name="Biersack A 1999"/&gt;

=== Policy and activism: politics versus environmentalism ===
The contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is [[political ecology]]. Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, and more.&lt;ref name="Pyke G 1984"/&gt; The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land. Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies). Such is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people of Hyde Park.&lt;ref name="Checker M 2005"/&gt;

Critiques on this modern perspective and non-governmental organizations' (NGOs) influences and effects on social groups is usually that they "generalize" and "obscure" local discourse and message.&lt;ref name="Brosius JP 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/200019|author=Brosius JP|year= 1999|title= Analyses And Interventions; Anthropological Engagements With Environmentalism|journal= Current Anthropology|jstor=200019|volume= 40|pages= 277â309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often resulting in environmentalism by bureaucrats, PR firms, governments, and industry.&lt;ref name="Brosius JP 1999"/&gt; An example of negative effects can be ascertained in the Malaysian Rainforest, in which NGOs and other outsider activist deflected the issue, ignoring the locality of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peter Brosius|first1=J.|title=Green Dots, Pink Hearts: Displacing Politics from the Malaysian Rain Forest|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=101|issue=1|pages=36â57|year=1999|pmid=19280759|jstor=683340|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Origins and pioneers ===

Environmental anthropology enters the field as an applied dimension built on the primary approaches within contemporary ecological anthropology.&lt;ref name="eoearth.org"&gt;Sponsel L. (2004, May). [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Ecological_anthropology Ecological Anthropology]. Encyclopedia of Earth.&lt;/ref&gt;
It focuses on how culture promotes connections between humans and their occupied ecosystems.&lt;ref name="eoearth.org"/&gt; American anthropologist Julian Steward (1902â1972), is the anthropological originator of cultural ecology.&lt;ref name="eoearth.org"/&gt; A troubled childhood led to Steward's fascination of the natural world. In 1918 Steward attended a California College, found inspiration from the natural environment and gained insight which promoted a future passion toward ecological studies.
Steward contributions to theories of cultural ecology and cultural evolution are renowned.&lt;ref name="Grinker R.R 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grinker|first1=ROY Richard|title=The Politics of Knowledge: Julian Steward, Leslie White, Melville Herskovits, and L. Luca Cavalli-Sforza|journal=Reviews in Anthropology|volume=37|pages=259|year=2008|doi=10.1080/00938150802038935 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transformations ===
Steward officially formulated the basic theoretical and methodological framework for cultural ecology in the 1950sâ60s. The transformation of cultural ecology into ecological anthropology took place in the 1960s through the 1980s by anthropologists [[John Bennett (anthropologist)|John Bennett]], [[Roy A. Rappaport]], [[Andrew P. Vayda]], and others. Two additional theoretical and methodological frameworks surfaced in the 1980s and 90s which attempted to cast ecological anthropology in a more scientific light. The first of which, was when Marvin Harris actively and systematically worked to develop "cultural materialism" as an approach to research. Harris's intention was to expose and analyze the ecological logic underlying multiple facets of culture. The cultural system was split into three parts by Harris; infrastructure, structure and superstructure. [[Eric Alden Smith]] and [[Bruce Winterhalder]] laid the blueprints for the second groundbreaking structure of evolutionary ecology. This would shift attention to the individual as the origin of adaptation, stressing choice when utilizing natural resources. A further expansion of ecological anthropology occurred in the 1990s when historical, political, and spiritual focused areas of research were incorporated into facets of human ecology and adaptation.&lt;ref name="eoearth.org"/&gt;

== Purpose ==
Anthropology is a field concerned specifically with the human condition and its relation to the natural world (i.e. the capacity of a human to manipulate the world around them). This can be seen through human interactions between each other as well as the flora and fauna present in a person's particular region and how they can be utilized. Humans everywhere have changed their environment and for better or for worse, taking a step back to the previous state of things would be a long arduous process. So how can people erase the mistakes of the past? How can they bring old, outdated things new life through innovation? These questions can provide insight into the development of a subfield of anthropology called environmental anthropology.

Environmental anthropology is a subfield of anthropology with roots in activism. The main focus of this particular perspective focuses on a discourse of activism. Agents operating within this sphere of thought have noticed aversive effects from human related manipulation, and are driven to try and force changes in the system which can eventually lead to replenishment of the region in question. The discipline itself if ever-changing because it must evolve to satiate the needs and appropriately address issues from the state and region level all the way down to complex communities, hence must uses a multitude of different approaches when considering a problem. According to the [[Society for Applied Anthropology]] (SfAA),

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Environmental anthropology is particularly effective in relating to and gaining understanding of cultural diversity in community settings, and intercultural/intersect oral conflict, thus lending itself to applied endeavors that involve collaboration among diverse interest groups for the common good."&lt;ref name="sfaa.net"&gt;The Society for Applied Anthropology (SfAA). [http://www.sfaa.net/eap/ea.html âWhat is Environmental Anthropology?â] Accessed March 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This means that a problem up stream of two separate cultural groups that affects them both can be resolved through a discourse of environmental anthropology, and although the two groups may not speak the same language, they can both activate to prompt change. Necessity can potentially quell conflict between two cultural groups if they must work together to combat an even bigger enemy (environmental injustice). Applied anthropology utilizes these understandings to work with people on a local basis as well as trying to satisfy share holders working to gain a resolution for problems related to health, education, social welfare, development and environmental protection.&lt;ref name="sfaa.net"/&gt;

Environmental anthropologists use a multitude of tools and orientations to best address the variance in different problems. According to SfAA,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Important among them are observation techniques, qualitative and survey interviews, systematic data collection techniques for accessing core values or areas of cultural consensus, ways of identifying and interpreting social networks and a variety of participatory cultural, social and environmental assessment techniques designed to improve intersect oral understanding of demographic composition, social/political dynamics, cultural and other forms of diversity, and capacity for planning and development."&lt;ref name="sfaa.net"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Environmental anthropologists aim to utilize their understanding of the culture at hand in order to gain as [[emic]] (an insider's understanding of the culture in question) a perspective as possible when dealing with these situations. These type of situations are ideal within the field and sheds positive light on a field that is criticized for refusing to accept this perspective.{{according to whom|date=April 2013}}

Although not found in all organisms, researchers have identified sexual intercourse patterns in certain animals that reflect extended female sexuality, such as in some old world primates, birds and insects.&lt;ref name="evolution of mind" /&gt; Extensive research has focused on analysing the [[White-toothed shrew|musk shrew]]'s rate of sexual behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rissman|first1=E. F.|title=Social variables influence female sexual behavior in the musk shrew (Suncus murinus)|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|date=1987|volume=101|issue=1|pages=3â6|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.101.1.3|pmid=3568606}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rissman|first1=E.

Both of these primates mate at all stages of the ovarian cycle, with only slight increases in sexual receptivity during [[fertility|fertile stages]], and decreases during [[menstruation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The EncyclopÃ¦dia of Sexual Behaviour, Volume 1|author1=Albert Ellis |author2=Albert Abarbanel |publisher=Elsevier|year=2013|isbn=1483225100|location=London|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In humans===
Human females are considered to exhibit the greatest degree of extended female sexuality, with receptivity to sexual intercourse remaining constant across fertile and infertile phases of the reproductive cycle, including during [[pregnancy]], [[lactation]], and in adolescence. In a study of 20,000 women from 13 countries, frequency of copulation was reportedly the same across all stages of the ovarian cycle. The only notable drop in sexual behaviour occurred during [[menstruation]]. Therefore, women largely showed the same level of sexual behaviour in the non-fertile phases of their ovarian cycles as in the fertile phases.&lt;ref name="human oestrus" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brewis|first1=A.|last2=Meyer|first2=M.|title=Demographic evidence that human ovulation is undetectable (at least in pair bonds)|journal=Current Anthropology|date=2005|volume=46|issue=3|pages=465â471|doi=10.1086/430016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have investigated the effect of [[Hormonal contraception|hormonal contraceptive]] use in women on the frequency of sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guida|first1=M.|title=Effects of two types of hormonal contraception--oral versus intravaginal--on the sexual life of women and their partners|journal=Human Reproduction|date=17 December 2004|volume=20|issue=4|pages=1100â1106|doi=10.1093/humrep/deh686|pmid=15608030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these contraceptives mimic a pregnancy state in females by altering hormone levels. Therefore, women who use these contraceptives do not experience the fertile phases of their cycles. In a systematic review, it appeared that the frequency of sexual intercourse was unaffected by contraceptive use in the majority of women. Although artificially created, this adds to the literature documenting the existence of copulation in humans during non-fertile periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burrows|first1=L.

=== Impact of concealed ovulation ===
In order to encourage [[mating]] in non-conceptive periods and to encourage males to maintain their proximity, males must possess imperfect knowledge of the female's [[fertility]] status. This is achieved through [[concealed ovulation]] in most animals that exhibit extended female sexuality.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grebe|first1=N. M.|last2=Gangestad|first2=S.

==Explanations==

=== Male assistance hypothesis ===
Mating outside the fertile window of their [[menstrual cycle|ovarian cycle]] may incur considerable costs for females, such as in time and energy usage. To counteract these costs, the male assistance hypothesis argues that females exhibit extended sexuality to obtain resources from males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=FÃ¼rtbauer|first1=I.|last2=Heistermann|first2=M.|last3=SchÃ¼lke|first3=O.|last4=Ostner|first4=J.|title=Concealed fertility and extended female sexuality in a non-human primate (Macaca assamensis)|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2011|volume=6|issue=8|pages=e23105|bibcode=2011PLoSO...623105F|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023105|pmid=21853074|pmc=3154278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Higham|first1=J.

Co.|location=Belmont, Calif.|isbn=978-0871507679|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this hypothesis, '''three predictions''' can be made.&lt;ref name="Thornhill Gangestad"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thornhill|first1=R.|last2=Gangestad|first2=S.W.|title=The evolutionary biology of human female sexuality|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Male provision of non-genetic resources====
Firstly, in species that demonstrate extended female sexuality, there should be evidence that the males provide non-genetic resources to females. This prediction is supported in a variety of animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=RodrÄ±Ìguez-GironÃ©s|first1=M. A.|last2=Enquist|first2=M.|title=The evolution of female sexuality|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=2001|volume=61|issue=4|pages=695â704|doi=10.1006/anbe.2000.1630}}&lt;/ref&gt; with reviews revealing that male assistance (such as food or protection), is provided to certain [[mammal]]s and communally breeding birds in exchange for mating outside the conceptive period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stacey|first1=P. B.|title=Female promiscuity and male reproductive success in social birds and mammals.|journal=American Naturalist|date=1982|pages=51â64|doi=10.1086/283969}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, female [[Common blackbird|blackbirds]] that solicit mating outside the fertile period have increased [[Mating|mate guarding]] from their pair-bonded partner. This increases protection against other [[Sexual coercion|sexually coercive]] males and ensures the provision of other material benefits.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wysocki|first=Dariusz|last2=Halupka|first2=Konrad|date=2004-04-01|title=The Frequency and Timing of Courtship and Copulation in Blackbirds, Turdus Merula, Reflect Sperm Competition and Sexual Conflict|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/10.1163/156853904323066766|journal=Behaviour|volume=141|issue=4|pages=501â512|doi=10.1163/156853904323066766|issn=1568-539X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review investigating primates that exhibit extended female sexuality, it was noted that females engaging in extended sexuality benefited from increased offspring protection and paternal care from males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soltis|first=Joseph|date=2002-01-01|title=Do primate females gain nonprocreative benefits by mating with multiple males?

====Enhanced reproductive success====
Secondly, in order to outweigh the aforementioned costs, [[mating]] during infertile phases should increase females' [[reproductive success]] by increasing the number of offspring produced. Current research has only investigated this factor indirectly, and it has predominantly been investigated in insects. For example, when male insects deliver material benefits in exchange for sexual access, the reproductive success of the females increases with the number of matings.&lt;ref name="Thornhill Gangestad" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arnqvist|first1=G.|last2=Nilsson|first2=T.|title=The evolution of polyandry: multiple mating and female fitness in insects|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=2000|volume=60|issue=2|pages=145â164|pmid=10973716|doi=10.1006/anbe.2000.1446}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that the [[mating]] behaviour assessed was not limited to extended female sexuality. Hence, it only provides indirect support for the second prediction.

====Shifting mate preferences and behaviour across the ovarian cycle====
{{See also|Ovulatory shift hypothesis}}

The final prediction of the male-assistance hypothesis has been extensively investigated. It predicts that females will exhibit differing [[mating preferences|mate preferences]] during fertile and non-fertile periods. Specifically, when fertile, the females will be sensitive to indicators of high genetic quality to increase the genetic quality of her [[offspring]].&lt;ref name="human oestrus" /&gt; Conversely, outside of the fertile period, females will show a preference for males who can provide resources for her and her offspring. In most species, males of higher genetic quality offer fewer non-genetic resources (such as shelter and food) than those of lower quality, so females are likely to choose different males at each stage.&lt;ref name="Thornhill Gangestad" /&gt;

Evidence for this prediction has been found in many different species. In [[Chicken|hens]], those near peak fertility show a preference for socially dominant roosters with large [[Comb (anatomy)|combs]]. Larger combs have been reliably associated with health and [[offspring]] survival so reliably indicate the genetic quality of the [[rooster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=T. H.|last2=Ligon|first2=J. D.|title=Female mating preferences in red junglefowl: a meta-analysis.|journal=Ethology, Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=2003|volume=15|issue=1|pages=63â72|doi=10.1080/08927014.2003.9522691}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the non-fertile phases, hens mate more indiscriminately with less regard for the larger comb size. A similar pattern emerges in humans. A review of relevant studies on female preferences across the [[menstrual cycle|ovarian cycle]] reveals that women show a greater preference for [[masculinity|masculine]] traits in fertile phases, especially for [[human mating strategies|short term mating]] intention. This finding occurs across a variety of traits, such as masculine [[human voice|voices]], body and facial features, [[odor|scent]], and [[Display (zoology)#Among humans|behavioural displays]].&lt;ref name="human oestrus"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gangestad|first1=S.

[[File:Big red rooster.jpg|thumb|The image shows a rooster with a comb. The comb concerns the red bit of 'skin' underneath the beak. Author: BazzaDaRambler]]

In addition to impacting [[mating preferences]], females have been found to exhibit differing mating behaviour at different cycle stages. An analysis of 121 studies with female birds showed that most mate outside their [[pair bond]] at a higher rate when fertile, especially when the primary partner possesses indicators of low quality [[gene]]s. During infertile phases, birds showed reductions in this behaviour, suggesting that the function of extended female sexuality is not to increase the genetic quality of offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=AkÃ§ay|first1=E.|last2=Roughgarden|first2=J.|title=Extra-pair paternity in birds: review of the genetic benefits.|journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research|date=2007|volume=9|issue=5|page=855}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, females show increased motivation for mating with other males at [[menstrual cycle|mid-cycle]] without an accompanying increase in [[sexual intercourse|copulation]] with their long term partner, especially if the partner was less physically attractive.&lt;ref name="human oestrus"/&gt;

===Hrdy's hypothesis===

[[File:Baby ginger monkey.jpg|thumb|An infant lutung (old world primate). Source: flickr.com]]
Hrdy's hypothesis is an extension of the male assistance hypothesis, in that both hypotheses argue that women have evolved this adaptation to gain some tangible benefit from males. According to Hrdy's hypothesis,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson Education"/&gt; extended female sexuality is an [[Adaptation|adaptive]] process with an aim of creating paternity confusion in their male counterparts.&lt;ref name="Thornhill Gangestad" /&gt; Paternity confusion refers to the male being unsure as to whether [[offspring]] are genetically his own. If the female mates with different males (at all points of her [[Menstrual cycle|ovarian cycle]]) whilst concealing [[fertility]], then the males will inevitably have paternity confusion.

Paternity confusion is proposed to be an adaptive function for preventing [[Infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Significance of Male and Female Reproductive Strategies for Male Reproductive Success in Wild Longtailed Macaques (Macaca Fascicularis)|last = Engelhardt|first = Antje|publisher = Cuvillier Verlag|year = 2004|isbn = |location = GÃ¶ttingen|pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Infanticide by Males and Its Implications|last = Van Schaik|first = Carl|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2000|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = 361}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Primates and Cetaceans: Field Research and Conservation of Complex Mammalian Societies|last = Yamagiwa|first = Juichi|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Tokyo|pages = 387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if the female can successfully create paternity confusion, males will be less likely to kill her offspring, as the lack of paternity certainty means that they run the risk of killing their own genetic [[offspring]]. Additionally, the males, in turn, are likely to protect the same female's offspring from infanticide that may be committed by other adults within the species. Once again, this is because they are uncertain about paternity, and aim to protect infants that are genetically their own.

====Paternity confusion in primates====
Researchers have analysed the behaviour of [[chimpanzee]]s, with particular reference to [[Female copulatory vocalizations|copulation calling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Townsend|first=Simon|date=2008|title=Female chimpanzees use copulation calls flexibly to prevent social competition|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002431|journal=PLOS ONE |volume=3 |issue= 6|pages= e2431.|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002431|pmid=22423311|pmc=3278306|access-date=|bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.2431T}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copulation calling is a type of vocalisation used to attract mates. The calls are vocalised either before, during, or after sexual intercourse. Copulation calling, in line with Hrdy's hypothesis, may then be one way to ensure that the female can mate with as many different males as possible, causing paternity confusion. Indeed, the authors found that the probability of copulatory calling in female chimpanzees was not modulated by the ovarian phase of the female caller, thereby aiding paternity confusion. This paternity confusion ultimately ensures that the woman has access to the resources of a number of different males. These resources can be utilised by her, as well as by her offspring.

Criticism of Hrdy's hypothesis emerges from evidence which suggests that male primates can discriminate between their own offspring and the offspring of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Biosocial Foundations of Family Processes|last = Booth|first = Alan|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year = 2010|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buchan|first=J. C.|date=2003|title=True paternal care in a multi-male primate society|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6954/abs/nature01866.html|journal=Nature |volume=425 |issue= 6954|pages= 179â181.|doi=10.1038/nature01866|pmid=12968180|access-date=|bibcode=2003Natur.425..179B}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, researchers analysed the [[DNA]] of 75 juvenile [[baboon]]s to conclude who fathered them. They found that males selectively cared for their own offspring, particularly when their offspring became involved in aggressive confrontations which posed the possibility of injuries or a threat to their [[Social status|social standing]]. Evidently, if males can discriminate between their own offspring and the offspring of others, then there is no purpose in the female attempting to create paternity confusion during the pregnancy stage. This would be counter-intuitive, as, once the offspring is born, the males will know whether the offspring is, or is not, their own. Future research will need to be conducted in this vein to investigate whether males in other species show the ability to discriminate between their own offspring and the offspring of others before coming to any decisive conclusions.

====Concealed estrus as a function of paternity confusion in primates====
Research is fairly consistent in the finding that species with concealed estrus mate at all stages of their ovarian cycle. For instance, mating activity in [[Macaques|assamese macaques]] (''Macaca assamensis'') has been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Furtbauer|first=Ines|date=2011|title=Concealed fertility and extended female sexuality in a non-human primate (macaca assamensis)|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0023105|journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue= 8|pages=  e23105.|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023105|pmid=21853074|pmc=3154278|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers analysed the levels of [[Menstrual cycle|progesterone]] in the monkeys, in order to establish the ovarian stage of the female, as progesterone peaks following the fertile window. They found that the females concealed estrus and were [[Estrous cycle|sexually receptive]] during the entire mating season. Concealed estrus and sexual receptivity (at all times of the ovarian cycle) aids paternity confusion. This is because the males are unsure of who mated with the female during her fertile period, and so do not know the identity of the father.

Hrdy's hypothesis has been criticised, however, on the basis that some female [[primate]]s show both extended female sexuality and [[sexual swelling|sexual swellings.]]&lt;ref name="Thornhill Gangestad" /&gt; In terms of Hrdy's hypothesis these two concepts are incompatible. Sexual swellings appear only during the most fertile phase of the female's ovarian cycle, with the purpose of advertising fertility. In sharp contrast, according to Hrdy, extended sexuality is adapted to [[Concealed ovulation|conceal fertility]] and ensure mating across all stages of the ovarian cycle, to aid paternity confusion.

===Male-driven hypotheses===
One of the alternative explanations is that extended female sexuality is 'male-driven'. This hypothesis is theoretically based on male uncertainty regarding the fertility status of females.&lt;ref name="Thornhill Gangestad" /&gt; Although some [[Menstrual cycle|physiological changes]] occur during the fertile period that may act as reliable indicators (e.g. the concentration of [[Estrogen|oestrogen]] can change female [[Odor|scent]]), most species have not evolved signals advertising fertility (e.g. [[sexual swelling]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pawlowski|first=B|date=1999|title=Loss of oestrus and concealed ovulation in human evolution: the case against the sexual selection hypothesis|url=|journal=Current Anthropology |volume=40 |issue= |pages= 257â275.|doi=10.2307/2991395|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, males will be unable to detect fertility with any precision. As a result, extended female sexuality is proposed as a male [[Sexual selection|sexually selected]] trait. Males will pursue sexual access throughout the entirety of the [[Menstrual cycle|ovarian cycle]] to increase their chances of [[Fertilisation|impregnating]] the female. According to this hypothesis, females lack any benefit from this activity due to their inability to conceive, yet will be [[Coercion|coerced]] by males to engage in [[sexual intercourse]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gangestad | first1 = S.

====The training hypothesis====

[[File:HumanSpermVideoAffordableHomeMicroscope.ogv|thumb|The video shows human sperm under a microscope. Author:StirlingJulian]]
Another hypothesis claiming that extended female sexuality has evolved to benefit males' interests is the 'training hypothesis'. It has been shown that women's [[immune system]]s attack foreign [[antigen]]s found in [[sperm]].&lt;ref name="Thornhill Gangestad" /&gt; This may reduce the likelihood of conception so reduce the [[reproductive success]] for the males. However, prior exposure to sperm antigens can dampen the immune response to increase the chances of successful conception and [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation.]]&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robertson | first1 = S.

Indeed, research has identified findings consistent with this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Couples who had used condoms before trying to conceive were more likely to suffer complications, such as [[pre-eclampsia]], during pregnancy as a result of the woman's immune system having no prior exposure to the antigens in the sperm. In non-humans, an increased frequency of copulation in crickets has been shown to reduce the female's immune response to sperm.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

This hypothesis has received much criticism. For example, as all mammals experience the same immune system responses to sperm antigens, this hypothesis predicts that all mammals should exhibit extended female sexuality. However, only few species of mammals exhibit sexual behaviour outside the conceptive period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introductiom to Behavioural Endocrinology|last=Nelson|first=R. J.|publisher=Sinauer|year=2000|isbn=|location=Sunderland|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spuhler's hypothesis===
Spuhler's hypothesis is a stand-alone hypothesis of extended female sexuality. Spuhler suggests that extended female sexuality has evolved as a by-product of an adaptation in females that increases the levels of [[Adrenal hormone|adrenal]] [[hormone|hormones.]]&lt;ref name="Thornhill Gangestad" /&gt; He proposed that secretion of higher levels of adrenal hormones were initially selected in women in order to increase endurance for walking or running. This hypothesis suggests that the larger [[adrenal gland]]s may have contributed to the development of extended female sexuality as they are also the main source of '[[libido]] hormones', which increase the female's sexual drive.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = J. P. | last2 = Wolfe | first2 = L. D. | year = 1983 | title = Human female sexual cycles and the concealment of ovulation problem | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Biological Structures | volume = 6 | issue = 4| pages = 345â352 | doi=10.1016/s0140-1750(83)90134-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, extended sexuality is little to do with sexual behavior, or evolutionary advantage, but rather it is just a by-product of hormones.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, G. C. (1966). Adaptation and Natural SelectionPrinceton University Press. ''Princeton, NJ''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this hypothesis cannot account for extended female sexuality in invertebrates, which lack adrenal systems.&lt;ref name="Thornhill Gangestad" /&gt; Additionally Spuhler highlighted the existence of larger [[thyroid]] and [[adrenal gland]]s in humans compared to other primates. However, no empirical evidence has established the link between hormones and endurance walking as an adaptation and extended female sexuality as a natural incidental effect. As there are costs to extended sexuality, it can be argued that selection would serve the dissociation of extended sexuality from the mechanism that affects endurance walking.&lt;ref name="Thornhill Gangestad" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4695">A '''First Prize''' diploma in music (French: '''Premier Prix''') is a high honor Diploma of Musical Studies, typically in performance or composition.  It is awarded by European [[Music school|music conservatories]] and European-styled conservatories elsewhere.  A First Prize diploma does not denote first in class, but rather, a very high level of artist proficiency.&lt;ref name="Conrey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook 1991" /&gt;  The typical period of study to earn a First Prize is one to two years.  A First Prize diploma is sometimes wrongly described as being similar to a master's degree in music performance or composition.  As of the mid-1990s, the degree in many European countries has been discontinued.

== France ==
At the [[Paris Conservatory]], and at all government sanctioned institutions of higher learning in France, a Diploma of Musical Studies â the degree that offers the First Prize â was accredited by the [[Minister of Culture (France)|French Ministry of Culture]], but not as a higher education academic degree.  A First Prize from any European government accredited or sanctioned conservatory is a major distinction.

=== First prize broadly discontinued; new diploma is instituted ===
Beginning around the late 1960s, First Prize degrees in all music disciplines, in a sense, became a victim of their own success.  Holders of First Prizes, more and more, were gaining positions in comprehensive institutions of higher learning.  In the mid-1990s, the [[Paris Conservatory]], and all French government accredited conservatories, discontinued offering First Prizes with Diplomas of Musical Studies and replaced them with D.F.S. degrees â Diplomas of Superior Performance.  The D.F.S. degree was instituted across Europe in part to incorporate comprehensive higher education in the fine arts with comprehensive universities and in part to unify standards in higher education of the [[Bologna declaration|Bologna Declaration]] that was adopted by 29 European countries&lt;ref name="Bologna Declaration countries" group=lower-alpha /&gt; in 1999.&lt;ref name="Bologna Declaration doc 1999" /&gt;

== Quebec ==
First Prize degrees in [[Quebec]] are awarded upon attained a high level of proficiency before a jury at the end of the fourth cycle of study at a conservatory â or two years.  While two years of schooling equals the time required to earn a master's degree in Quebec, the scope of education does not offer the equivalence of a master's degree.  Thus, a student who wishes to pursue doctoral studies might need compensatory education.

Music conservatories in [[Quebec]] fall under the purview of Quebec's [[Ministry of Culture and Communications (Quebec)|Ministry of Culture and Communications]]. The [[Conservatory of Music and Drama in Quebec]] [[:fr:Conservatoire de musique et d'art dramatique du QuÃ©bec|(fr)]] was founded in 1942 by [[Wilfrid Pelletier]].  Since then, Quebec has added a network of conservatories [[Gatineau]], [[Rimouski]], [[Saguenay, Quebec|Saguenay]], [[Trois-RiviÃ¨res]], and [[Val-d'Or]].

      <comment>Further explained definition of what gender history does</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10909">'''Gender history''' is a sub-field of [[history]] and [[gender studies]], which looks at the past from the perspective of [[gender]]. It is in many ways, an outgrowth of [[women's history]]. The discipline considers in what ways historical events and periodization impact women differently from men. For instance, in an influential article in 1977, "Did Women have a Renaissance?", [[Joan Kelly]] questioned whether the notion of a Renaissance was relevant to women.&lt;ref name = "kelly"&gt;"Did Women have a Renaissance?" ''Becoming Visible: Women in European History''. Houghton Mifflin, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Gender historians are also interested in how gender difference has been perceived and configured at different times and places, usually with the assumption that such differences are socially constructed. These social constructions of gender throughout time are also represented as changes in the expected norms of behavior for those labeled male or female. Those who study gender history note these changes in norms and those performing them over time and interpret what those changes say about the larger social/cultural/political climate. 

==Impact==
Despite its relatively short life, gender history (and its forerunner women's history) has had a rather significant effect on the general study of [[history]]. Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases, each with its own challenges and outcomes, but always making an impact of some kind on the historical discipline. Although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession, other influences are more subtle, even though they may be more politically groundbreaking in the end. By 1970, gender historians turned to documenting ordinary women's expectations, aspirations and status. In the 80s with the rise of the feminist movement, the focus shifted to uncovering women' oppression and discrimination. Nowadays, gender history is more about charting female agency and recognizing female achievements in several fields that were usually dominated by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Focus/Gender/articles.html|title=History in Focus: articles on gender history|website=www.history.ac.uk|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Within the profession===
According to historian [[Joan Wallach Scott|Joan Scott]], conflict occurred between Women's History [[List of historians|historians]] and other historians in a number of ways.&lt;ref name = "scott"&gt;"Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis," [[American Historical Review]]
91, No. 5 (December 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[American Historical Association]], when [[feminism|feminists]] argued that female historians were treated unequally within the field and underrepresented in the association, they were essentially leveling charges of historical negligence by traditional historians. Notions of [[professional]]ism were not rejected outright, but they were accused of being biased.

===Supplementary history===
According to Scott, the construction of Women's History as "supplementary" to the rest of history had a similar effect. At first glance, a supplement simply adds information which has been missing from the greater story, but as Scott points out, it also questions why the information was left out in the first place. Whenever it is noticed that a woman found to be missing from [[recorded history|written history]], Women's History first describes her role, second, examines which mechanisms allowed her role to be omitted, and third, asks to what other information these mechanisms were blind.

===Gender theory===
Finally, the advent of [[gender studies|gender theory]] once again challenged commonly held ideas of the discipline, including those scholars studying Women's History. [[Postmodernism|Post-modern]] criticism of essentialising [[social construction|socially constructed]] groups, be they [[gender]] groups or otherwise, pointed out the weaknesses in various sorts of history. In the past, [[historian]]s have attempted to describe the shared experience of large numbers of people, as though these people and their experiences were homogeneous and uniform. Women have multiple identities, influenced by any number of factors including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[Social class|class]], and any examination of history which conflates their experiences, fails to provide an accurate picture.

==History of Masculinity==
The history of masculinity emerged as a specialty in the 1990s, evidenced by numerous studies of men in groups, and how concepts of masculinity shape their values and behavior. Gail Bederman identified two approaches: one that emerged from women's history and one that ignored it:
:Two types of âmenâs historyâ are being written these days. One builds on twenty years of womenâs history scholarship, analyzing masculinity as part of larger gender and cultural processes. The other . . . looks to the past to see how men in early generations understood (and misunderstood) themselves as men. Books of the second type mostly ignore womenâs history findings and methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Bederman, ''Journal of American History'' 84 (1997) p. 680&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender in religion ==
All over the world, religion is formed around a divine, supernatural figure. While the idea of the divine, supernatural figure varies from religion to religion, each one is framed around different concepts of what it means to be male and female. Furthermore, the religion of a culture usually directly corresponds or is influenced by the culture's gender structure, like the family structures and/or the state. Therefore the religious structure and the gender structure work together to form and define a culture, creating the defining structures of equality and uniformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in History: Global Perspectives|last=Wiesner-Hanks|first=Merry E|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-8995-8|location=Malden, MA|pages=109,110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64745">The '''ISASMELT''' process is an energy-efficient [[smelting]] process that was jointly developed from the 1970s to the 1990s by [[Mount Isa Mines]] Limited (a subsidiary of [[MIM Holdings Limited]] and now part of [[Glencore]] plc) and the Australian governmentâs Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ("[[CSIRO]]"). It has relatively low capital and operating costs for a smelting process.

[[File:Graph total Isasmelt capacity.png|thumbnail|The installed feed capacity of Isasmelt furnaces has grown as the technology has been accepted in smelters around the world. Graph courtesy of Xstrata Technology.]]

ISASMELT technology has been applied to lead, copper, and nickel smelting, and by 2013 fifteen plants were in operation in ten countries, with another five in various stages of development.&lt;ref name = "Installations list"&gt;[http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Installations/Pages/Installations.aspx List of Isasmelt installations]&lt;/ref&gt; The installed capacity of the operating plants in 2013 was over 8 million tonnes per year ('''t/y''') of feed materials, with additional capacity to come on line in 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref name = "XT"&gt;Information provided courtesy of Xstrata Technology&lt;/ref&gt;

Smelters based on the copper ISASMELT process are among the lowest-cost copper smelters in the world.&lt;ref name = "Bill, 2002"&gt;J L Bill, T E Briffa, A S Burrows, C R Fountain, D Retallick, J M I Tuppurainen, J S Edwards, and P Partington, "IsasmeltâMount Isa copper smelter progress update," in: ''Sulfide Smelting 2002'', Eds R L Stephens and H Y Sohn (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania), 2002, 181â193.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ISASMELT Furnace==
An ISASMELT furnace is an upright-cylindrical shaped steel vessel that is lined with refractory bricks.&lt;ref name = "Brochure"&gt;Xstrata Technology, "ISASMELT â High productivity, clean smelting," ISASMELT brochure, 2012. Available from: [http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Publications/Documents/XTT_1603_ISASMELT_Broch_V2_SR-2.pdf Isasmelt brochure]. Accessed 22 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a molten bath of slag, matte or metal (depending on the application) at the bottom of the furnace. A steel lance is lowered into the bath through a hole in the roof of the furnace, and air or oxygen-enriched air that is injected through the lance into the bath causes vigorous agitation of the bath.

[[File:Cut-away view of an Isasmelt furnace.png|thumbnail|Cut-away view of an Isasmelt furnace. Image courtesy of Xstrata Technology.]]
Mineral concentrates or materials for recycling are dropped into the bath through another hole in the furnace roof or, in some cases, injected down the lance. These feed materials react with the oxygen in the injected gas, resulting in an intensive reaction in a small volume (relative to other smelting technologies).

ISASMELT lances contain one or more devices called "swirlers" that cause the injected gas to spin within the lance, forcing it against the lance wall, cooling it. The swirler consists of curved vanes around a central pipe forming an annular flow. &lt;ref name ="Abulnaga,1989"&gt; B E Abulnaga, "Air Pressure Measurements on the Isasmelt Copper Smelter at Mount Isa - Research paper No VI6-480 - Clayton, Vic - CSIRO Division of Mineral and Process Engineering, (Dec 1989), &lt;/ref&gt; They are designed to minimize pressure losses changing the angle from axial to tangential thus creating a strong vortex &lt;ref name = "Abulnaga,1990"&gt;B.E Abulnaga, Australian Patent Application 1990PK0047 "A smelter lance swirler , Applicant CSIRO (1990) &lt;/ref&gt;. The vortex helps mix liquids and solids with oxygen in the bath.&lt;ref name = Hooper,1992&gt;J Hooper, B.E. Abulnaga, "The Design and Experimental Evaluation of an Aerodynamic Swirler for a Top Injection Lance System," Research report No VI6-555 - Clayton,Vic: CSIRO Division of Mineral and Process Engineering, (1992). &lt;/ref&gt; The cooling effect results in a layer of slag "freezing" on the outside of the lance. This layer of solid slag protects the lance from the high temperatures inside the furnace. The tip of the lance that is submerged in the bath eventually wears out, and the worn lance is easily replaced with a new one when necessary. The worn tips are subsequently cut off and a new tip welded onto the lance body before it is returned to the furnace.

ISASMELT furnaces typically operate in the range of 1000â1200&amp;nbsp;Â°C, depending on the application.&lt;ref name = "Brochure"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"&gt;W J Errington, J H Fewings, V P Keran and W T Denholm, "The Isasmelt lead smelting process," ''Transactions of the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy (Section C: Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy)'', 96, (1987), C1âC6.&lt;/ref&gt; The refractory bricks that form the internal lining of the furnace protect the steel shell from the heat inside the furnace.

The products are removed from the furnace through one or more "tap holes" in a process called "tapping". This can be either continuous removal or in batches, with the tap holes being blocked with clay at the end of a tap, and then reopened by drilling or with a thermic lance when it is time for the next tap.

The products are allowed to separate in a settling vessel, such as a rotary holding furnace or an electric furnace.

While smelting sulfide concentrates, most of the energy needed to heat and melt the feed materials is derived from the reaction of oxygen with the sulfur and iron in the concentrate. However, a small amount of supplemental energy is required. ISASMELT furnaces can use a variety of fuels, including coal, coke, petroleum coke, oil and natural gas. The solid fuel can be added through the top of the furnace with the other feed materials, or it can be injected down the lance. Liquid and gaseous fuels are injected down the lance.

==Advantages of the ISASMELT process==
[[File:Isasmelt feed chute.png|thumbnail|An ISASMELT furnace is typically fed with damp concentrate falling from a conveyor belt into the furnace. Image courtesy of Xstrata Technology.]]

The advantages of the ISASMELT process include:

* High productivity with a small footprint: Xstrata's copper smelter in Mount Isa treats over 1 million t/y of copper concentrate through a single furnace 3.75 m in diameter.&lt;ref name = "Brochure"/&gt; The small footprint makes the process well suited to retrofitting to existing smelters where there are significant space constraints&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"&gt;R R Bhappu, K H Larson and R D Tunis, "Cyprus Miami Mining Corporation â smelter modernization project summary and status", in: ''EPD Congress 1994'', Ed. G Warren (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1993), 555â570.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Li, 2003"&gt;Y Li and P S Arthur, "Yunnan Copper Corporation's new smelter â China's first ISASMELT", in: ''Yazawa International Symposium, Metallurgical and Materials Processing: Principles and Technologies, Volume II: High-temperature metals production'', Eds. F Kongoli, K Itagaki, C Yamauchi and H Y Sohn (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 2003), 371â384.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Simple operation: the ISASMELT furnace does not require extensive feed preparation as the feed can be discharged from a belt conveyor directly into the furnace&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt;
* high energy efficiency: installing an ISASMELT furnace in the Mount Isa copper smelter reduced energy consumption by over 80% (through better use of the inherent energy contained in the sulfide concentrate) compared with the roaster and reverberatory furnaces previously used there&lt;ref name = "Bill, 2002"/&gt;
* Flexibility in feed types: ISASMELT furnaces have been used to smelt copper, lead and nickel concentrates with a wide range of compositions,&lt;ref&gt;W G Davenport, "Copper extraction from the 60s into the 21st century", in: ''Proceedings of the Copper 99âCobre 99 International Conference. Volume IâPlenary Lectures/Movement of Copper and Industry Outlook/Copper Applications and Fabrication,'' Eds G A Eltringham, N L Piret and M Sahoo (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1999), 55â79.&lt;/ref&gt; including high levels of magnetite,&lt;ref name = "Coulter"&gt;M D Coulter and C R Fountain, "The Isasmelt process for copper smelting", in: ''Non-ferrous Smelting Symposium, Port Pirie, South Australia, September 1989'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne), 237â240.&lt;/ref&gt; and secondary materials, such as copper scrap and lead-acid battery paste&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"&gt;P S Arthur and S P Hunt, "ISASMELT â 25 years of continuous evolution", in: ''The John Floyd International Symposium on Sustainable Developments in Metals Processing, Melbourne, 3â6 July 2005'', Eds. M Nilmani and W J Rankin (NCS Associates (Australia) Pty Ltd, 2005), 73â94.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Flexibility in fuel types: ISASMELT furnaces can operate with a variety of fuels, including lump coal of varying ranks, coke (lump or fine), petroleum coke, oil (including recycled oil), natural gas, and liquid petroleum gas, depending on which is the most economic at the smelter's location&lt;ref name = "Brochure"/&gt;
* High turn-down ratio: the feed rate to a single ISASMELT installation can easily be scaled up or down, depending on the availability of concentrate and the needs of the smelter
* Low feed carry over: ISASMELT furnaces typically lose about 1% of the feed as carry-over with the waste gas, meaning that there is less material that needs to be returned to the furnace for retreatment&lt;ref name = "Brochure"/&gt;
* Effective containment of fugitive emissions: because the furnace has only two openings at the top, any fugitive emissions can easily be captured&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt;
* High elimination of deleterious minor elements: due to the flushing action of the gases injected into the ISASMELT furnace slags, copper ISASMELT furnaces have a high elimination of minor elements, such as bismuth and arsenic, that can have deleterious effects on the properties of the product copper&lt;ref name = "Fountain, 1991"&gt;C R Fountain, M D Coulter and J S Edwards, "Minor element distribution in the copper Isasmelt process", in: ''Copper '91, Volume IV'', Eds. C DÃ­az, C Landolt, A Luraschi and C J Newman (Pergamon Press: New York, 1991), 359â373.&lt;/ref&gt;
* High sulfur dioxide concentration in the waste gas: the use of oxygen enrichment gives the ISASMELT plants high sulfur dioxide concentrations in the waste gas stream, making acid plants cheaper to build and operate
* Relatively low operating cost: the energy efficiency of the process, the simple feed preparation, the relative lack of moving parts, low feed carry-over rates, low labour requirements and the ease of replacing lances and refractory linings when they are worn give the ISASMELT process relatively low operating costs&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt;
* Relatively low capital cost: the simplicity of the construction of the ISASMELT furnaces and the ability to treat concentrate without drying make it cheaper than other smelting processes.&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Samaniego"&gt;L M Samaniego and W T Pino, "Modernization and start-up of the SPCC Ilo smelter", in: ''Cu2007 â Volume III (Book I): The Carlos DÃ­az Symposium on Pyrometallurgy'', Eds. A R M Warner, C J Newman, A Vahed, D B George, P J Mackey and A Warczok (Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum: Westmount, Quebec, 2007), 193â202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the ISASMELT Process==

===Early developmental work (1973â1980)===
The history of the ISASMELT process began with the invention in 1973 of the '''Sirosmelt lance''' by Drs Bill Denholm and John Floyd at the CSIRO.&lt;ref name = "Fewings"&gt;J H Fewings, "Management of Innovation â The ISASMELT process," Presented at the AMIRA ''Innovation in Metal Production'' technical meeting at Mount Isa, Queensland, 3â4 October 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"&gt;J M Floyd and D S Conochie, SIROSMELT â The first ten years, in ''Extractive Metallurgy Symposium'', pp 1â8, The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Melbourne Branch, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; The lance was developed as a result of investigations into improved tin-smelting processes, in which it was found that the use of a '''top-entry submerged lance''' would result in greater heat transfer and mass transfer efficiencies.&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"/&gt;

The idea of top-entry submerged lances goes back to at least 1902, when such a system was attempted in Clichy, France.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Queensland Government Mining Journal]]'', 15 January 1903, pp 27.&lt;/ref&gt; However, early attempts failed because of the short lives of the lances on submersion in the bath. The Mitsubishi copper smelting process is one alternative approach, wherein lances are used in a furnace, but they are not submerged into the bath. Instead, they blow oxygen-enriched air onto the surface of the slag (top jetting).&lt;ref&gt;T Shibasaki, K Kanamori and M Hayashi, "Development of (sic) large scale Mitsubishi furnace at Naoshima," in ''Proceedings of the Savard/Lee International Symposium on Bath Smelting'', Eds J K Brimacombe, P J Mackey, G J W Kor, C Bickert and M G Ranade (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1992), 147â158.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a water-cooled, top-jetting lance was the basis of the LD ([[Basic oxygen steelmaking|Linz-Donawitz]]) steelmaking process. This does not produce the same intensity of mixing in the bath as a submerged lance.&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"/&gt;

The CSIRO scientists first tried developing a submerged lance system using a water-cooled lance system, but moved to an air-cooled system because "scale up of the water-cooled lance would have been problematic".&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"/&gt; Introducing any water to a system involving molten metals and slags can result in catastrophic explosions, such as that in the Scunthorpe Steelworks in November 1975 in which 11 men lost their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rediron-steve.blogspot.com.au/2010/11/remembering-1975-scunthorpe-blast.html Remembering the 1975 Scunthorpe blast furnace disaster]. Accessed 14 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inclusion of the swirlers in the Sirosmelt lance and forming a splash coating of slag on the lance were the major innovations that led to the successful development of submerged lance smelting.

From 1973, the CSIRO scientists began a series of trials using the Sirosmelt lance to recover metals from industrial slags in Australia, including lead softener slag at the [[Port Pirie#History|Broken Hill Associated Smelters]] in [[Port Pirie]] (1973), tin slag from Associated Tin Smelters in [[Sydney]] (1974), copper converter slag at the [[Port Kembla, New South Wales#Industrial Change|Electrolytic Refining and Smelting]] ("ER&amp;S") [[Port Kembla, New South Wales|Port Kembla]] plant (1975) and copper anode furnace slag at Copper Refineries Limited (another subsidiary of MIM Holdings) in [[Townsville]] (1976) and of copper converter slag in [[Mount Isa]] (1977).&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"/&gt; The work then proceeded to smelting tin concentrates (1975) and then sulfidic tin concentrates (1977).&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"/&gt;

MIM and ER&amp;S jointly funded the 1975 Port Kembla converter slag treatment trials and MIMâs involvement continued with the slag treatment work in Townsville and Mount Isa.&lt;ref name = "Floyd, 1978"&gt;.J M Floyd, G J Leahy, R L Player and D J Wright, "Submerged combustion technology applied to copper slag treatment," in: ''The Aus.I.M.M. Conference, North Queensland, September 1978'', (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1978), 323â337.&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel with the copper slag treatment work, the CSIRO was continuing to work in tin smelting. Projects included a five tonne ("t") plant for recovering tin from slag being installed at Associated Tin Smelters in 1978, and the first sulfidic smelting test work being done in collaboration with Aberfoyle Limited, in which tin was fumed from pyritic tin ore and from mixed tin and copper concentrates.&lt;ref name = "Denholm"&gt;W T Denholm, "Matte fuming of tin from sulfide concentrates containing tin and copper, in: ''AustraliaâJapan Extractive Metallurgy Symposium, Sydney, Australia, 1980'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1980), 321â333.&lt;/ref&gt; Aberfoyle was investigating the possibility of using the Sirosmelt lance approach to improve the recovery of tin from complex ores, such as its mine at Cleveland, Tasmania, and the Queen Hill ore zone near [[Zeehan, Tasmania|Zeehan]] in [[Tasmania]].&lt;ref name = "Foo"&gt;K A Foo and J M Floyd, "Development of the matte fuming process for tin recovery from sulphide minerals," in: ''LeadâZincâTin â80: World Symposium on Metallurgy and Environmental Control'', Eds. J M Cigan, T S Mackey and T J OâKeefe (The Metallurgical Society of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1980), 786â800.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Biehl"&gt;R L Biehl, D S Conochie, K A Foo and B W Lightfoot, "Design, construction and commissioning of a 4 tonne/hour matte fuming pilot plant," in ''The Aus.I.M.M. Melbourne Branch, Symposium on Extractive Metallurgy, November 1984'', (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1984), 9â15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aberfoyle work led to the construction and operation in late 1980 of a four t/h tin matte fuming pilot plant at the [[Western Mining Corporation]]âs Kalgoorlie Nickel Smelter, located to the south of [[Kalgoorlie]], [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name = "Biehl"/&gt;

===Lead ISASMELT development===

====Small-scale work (1978â1983)====
In the early 1970s, the traditional blast furnace and sinter plant technology that was the mainstay of the lead smelting industry was coming under sustained pressure from more stringent environmental requirements, increased energy costs, decreasing metal prices and rising capital and operating costs.&lt;ref name = "Fewings"/&gt;

Many smelting companies were seeking new processes to replace sinter plants and blast furnaces. Possibilities included the QSL lead smelting process, the Kivcet process, the [[Kaldo converter|Kaldo top-blown rotary converter]], and adapting Outokumpuâs successful copper and nickel flash furnace to lead smelting.&lt;ref&gt;C O Bounds, "Innovative processes: lead-zinc-tin," in: ''1990 Elliott Symposium on Chemical Process Metallurgy'', Eds P J Koros and G R St Pierre (Iron and Steel Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania), 1990, 73â91.&lt;/ref&gt;

MIM was seeking ways to safeguard the future of its Mount Isa lead smelting operations. It did this in two ways:
# working to improve the environmental and operational performance of its existing operations
# investigating new technologies.&lt;ref name = "Fewings"/&gt;
MIM investigated new technologies by arranging plant testing of large parcels of Mount Isa lead concentrates for all the then process options except for the Kivcet process. At the same time, it had been aware of the use of top-jetting lances in the Mitsubishi and [[Boliden AB#History|Kaldo]] processes, and of top-entry submerged combustion lance investigations undertaken by [[ASARCO]] Limited (which had a long association with MIM, including being a shareholder in MIM Holdings) in the 1960s. This stimulated MIMâs interest in the Sirosmelt lance, which was seen as a way to produce a robust submerged lance.&lt;ref name = "Fewings"/&gt;

Following the copper slag trials of 1976â1978, MIM initiated a joint project with the CSIRO in 1978 to investigate the possibility of applying Sirosmelt lances to lead smelting.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"/&gt;

The work began with computer modelling the equilibrium thermodynamics (1978) and was followed by laboratory bench-scale test work using large alumina silicate crucibles (1978â1979). The results were sufficiently encouraging that MIM built a 120&amp;nbsp;kg/h test rig in Mount Isa. It began operation in September 1980. This was used to develop a two-stage process to produce lead bullion from Mount Isa lead concentrate. The first stage was an oxidation step that removed virtually all the sulfur from the feed, oxidising the contained lead to lead oxide (PbO) that was largely collected in the slag (some was carried out of the furnace as lead oxide fume that was returned for lead recovery). The second stage was a reduction step in which the oxygen was removed from the lead to form lead metal.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"/&gt;

==== The lead ISASMELT pilot plant (1983â1990) ====
Following the 120&amp;nbsp;kg/h test work, MIM decided to proceed to install a 5&amp;nbsp;t/h lead ISASMELT pilot plant in its Mount Isa lead smelter. It bought Aberfoyleâs matte fuming furnace and transported it from Kalgoorlie to Mount Isa, where it was rebuilt and commissioned in 1983&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"/&gt; to demonstrate the first stage of the process in continuous operation and for testing the reduction step using batches of high-lead slag.&lt;ref name = "Matthew"&gt;S P Matthew, G R McKean, R L Player and K E Ramus, "The continuous Isasmelt lead process," in ''Lead-Zinc â90'', Eds T S Mackey and R D Prengaman (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale Pennsylvania), 1990, 889â901.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key features of the pilot plant was that it was run by operationsâ personnel in the lead smelter as though it was an operationsâ plant.&lt;ref name = "Fewings"/&gt; The high lead slag produced by the continuous smelting of the lead concentrate was subsequently treated in the sinter plant, thus increasing the production of the lead smelter by up to 17%.&lt;ref name = "Bartsch"&gt;P Bartsch, C R Fountain and B Anselmi, "Radio Hill project," in: ''Pyrosem WA'', Eds. E J Grimsey and N D Stockton (Murdoch University Press: Perth, Western Australia, 1990), 232â250.&lt;/ref&gt; This gave the operationsâ people ownership of the plant and an incentive to make it work, thus ensuring management and maintenance priority. It also gave MIM assurance that the process simple enough to be operable in a production environment, with normal staff and supervision, and that it was robust enough to withstand normal control excursions.&lt;ref name = "Fewings"/&gt; In addition to the continuous operation of lead concentrate to produce high-lead slag, the pilot plant was used to produce lead metal from batches of the slag,&lt;ref name = "Matthew"/&gt; investigate the wear rates of the furnaceâs refractory lining and lances, and initial work aimed at developing a low-pressure version of the Sirosmelt lance. The result was a lance design that allowed operation at significantly lower pressure than the initial values of about 250 kilopascal (gauge) ("kPag"), thus reducing operating costs.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"/&gt;

MIM built a second, identical furnace next to the first, and commissioned it in August 1985. This combination of furnaces was used to demonstrate the two-stage process in continuous operation in mid-1987.&lt;ref name = "Matthew"/&gt; However, for most of the time the two furnaces were not able to operate simultaneously due to a constraint in the capacity of the baghouse used to filter the lead dust from the waste gas.&lt;ref name = "Matthew"/&gt;

A series of process improvements, particularly in the waste gas handling system, resulted in increasing the throughput of the plant from the initial design of 5 t/h to 10 t/h.&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt; The pilot plant had treated more than 125,000 t of lead concentrate by April 1989.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt;

The two furnaces were also used to develop a process to recover lead from the Mount Isa lead smelterâs drossing operations.&lt;ref name = "Matthew"/&gt;

==== The lead ISASMELT demonstration plant (1991â1995) ====
Based on the results of the pilot plant work, the MIM Holdings Board of Directors approved the construction of an A$65 million&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"&gt;R L Player, C R Fountain and J M I Tuppurainen, "Isasmelt developments," in: ''Mervyn Willis Symposium and Smelting &amp; Refining Course, 6â8 July 1992'' (The University of Melbourne: Melbourne, 1992), 20:1â20:13.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstration plant, capable of producing 60,000 t/y of lead bullion.&lt;ref name = "Matthew"/&gt; This plant operated from early 1991 until 1995.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2005"&gt;W J Errington, P Arthur, J Wang and Y Dong, [http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Publications/Technical%20Papers/XT_ISASMELT_Paper_ErringtonPbIsa.pdf "The Isa-YMG lead smelting process,"] in: ''Lead-Zinc â05, Kyoto, Japan, 17â19 October 2005''. Accessed: 16 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially designed to treat 20 t/h of lead concentrate using lance air enriched to 27%. However, the oxygen originally designated for its use was diverted to the more profitable copper smelting operations, and the feed rate to the lead ISASMELT demonstration plant was severely restricted.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2005"/&gt; When there was sufficient oxygen available in 1993 to increase the enrichment level to 33â35%, treatment rates of up to 36 t/h of concentrate were achieved, with residual lead in the final reduction furnace slag being in the range of 2â5%.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2005"/&gt;

The two-stage approach to ISASMELT lead smelting was partly driven by the relatively low lead content of Mount Isa lead concentrates (typically in the range of 47â52% lead during the lead ISASMELT development period).&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R M S Watsford, "Lead-zinc-silver ore concentration by Mount Isa Mines Ltd, Mount Isa, Queensland," in: ''Mining and Metallurgical Practices in Australasia, The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume'', Ed. J T Woodcock (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1980) 208â213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P D Munro, "Lead-zinc-silver ore concentration practice at the lead-zinc concentrator of Mount Isa Mines Limited, Mount Isa, Qld," in: ''Australasian Mining and Metallurgy, The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume, Second Edition'', Eds. J T Woodcock and J K Hamilton (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Melbourne, 1993), 498â503.&lt;/ref&gt; Trying to produce lead bullion in a single furnace with such low concentrate grades would result in excessive fuming of lead oxide with a huge amount of material that would have to be returned to the furnace to recover the lead&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"/&gt; and, consequently, a higher energy demand as that material had to be reheated to the furnace temperatures.

Concentrates with higher lead contents can be smelted directly into lead metal in a single furnace without excess fuming.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"/&gt; This was demonstrated on the large scale in 1994, when 4000 t of concentrate containing 67% lead were treated at rates up to 32 t/h with lance air enriched to 27%. During these trials, 50% of the lead in the concentrate was converted to lead bullion in the smelting furnace, while most of the rest ended up as lead oxide in the smelting furnace slag.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2005"/&gt;

Like the lead ISASMELT pilot plant, the lead ISASMELT demonstration plant suffered from constraints imposed by the waste gas handling system. In the case of the demonstration plant, the problem was caused by sticky fume that formed an insulating layer on the convection tube bundles of the waste heat boilers, significantly reducing the heat transfer rates and thus the ability of the boilers to reduce the waste gas temperature.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; As the plant used baghouses to filter lead fume from the waste gas, it was necessary to reduce the temperature of the gas below the point at which the bags would be damaged by high temperatures. The problem was solved by allowing cool air to mix with the hot waste gas to lower the temperature to a level at which the baghouse could operate.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; This reduced the ISASMELT plantâs capacity because it was again limited by the volume of gas that could be filtered by the baghouse.

The lead ISASMELT demonstration plant was mothballed in 1995 because there was insufficient concentrate to keep both it and the rest of the lead smelter operating.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; It was too small to treat all the Mount Isa lead concentrate by itself.

==== Commercial primary-lead ISASMELT plants (2005â ) ====
The first commercial primary-lead ISASMELT furnace was installed at the Yunnan Chihong Zinc and Germanium Company Limited (YCZG) greenfield zinc and lead smelting complex at Qujing in Yunnan Province in China.&lt;ref name = "YCZG"&gt;[http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Installations/Pages/CymgLeadSmelter.aspx YCZG Isasmelt plant.] Accessed 17 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This furnace was part of a plant consisting of the ISASMELT furnace and a blast furnace specially designed to treat high-lead ISASMELT slag.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2005"/&gt; The ISASMELT furnace was designed to produce both the slag and lead bullion, with about 40% of the lead in the concentrate being converted to lead bullion in the ISASMELT furnace.&lt;ref name = "YCZG"/&gt;

The ISASMELTâblast furnace combination was designed to treat 160,000 t/y of lead concentrate.&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt;

The second commercial primary-lead ISASMELT furnace was commissioned at Kazzincâs smelting complex at Ust-Kamenogorsk in Kazakhstan in 2012. It is designed to treat 300,000 t/y of lead concentrate, again using an ISASMELTâblast furnace combination.&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt;

YCZG is constructing another lead ISASMELT at a new greenfield smelter in Huize in China, and this is due to be commissioned in 2013.&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt;

==== Secondary-lead smelting (1982â ) ====
While the lead ISASMELT 5 t/h pilot plant was being designed in 1982â1983, MIM continued to use the 120&amp;nbsp;kg/h test rig to develop other processes, including the dross treatment process previously mentioned, and the treatment of lead-acid battery paste for lead recycling.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"/&gt;

The MIM Holdings Board of Directors approved the construction of an ISASMELT plant at Britannia Refined Metals, the companyâs lead refinery at Northfleet in the United Kingdom, for commercial recovery of lead from battery paste to supplement the existing plant, which used a short rotary furnace to produce 10,000 t/y of lead.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2010"&gt;W J Errington, P Hawkins and A Lim, [http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Publications/Technical%20Papers/ISASMELT%20%20FOR%20LEAD%20RECYCLING.pdf "ISASMELT for lead recycling,â] in: ''PbZn 2010'', Eds. A Siegmund, L Centomo, C Geenen, N Piret, G Richards and R Stephens (Wiley Publishing, 2010). Accessed: 17 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The new plant increased annual production to 30,000 t/y of recycled lead, and was commissioned in 1991.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2010"/&gt; The ISASMELT furnace was used to produce low-antimony lead bullion from the battery paste and an antimony-rich slag that contained 55â65% lead oxide. While it was possible to recover the lead from the slag in the ISASMELT furnace by a reduction step, the total throughput of the plant was increased by treating the slag in the short rotary furnace when sufficient quantities of the slag had been generated.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2010"/&gt; The plant was designed to treat 7.7 t/h of battery paste, but routinely treated 12 t/h.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2010"/&gt; The plant was shut down in 2004 when Xstrata Zinc, which took over the MIM Holdings lead operations, decided to leave the lead recycling business.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2010"/&gt;

A second lead ISASMELT plant for recovering lead from recycled batteries was commissioned in 2000 in Malaysia at Metal Reclamation Industriesâ Pulau Indah plant.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2010"/&gt; This ISASMELT plant has a design capacity of 40,000 t/y of lead bullion.&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt;

=== Copper ISASMELT development ===

==== Small-scale test work (1979â1987) ====
Scientists at the CSIRO conducted small-scale test work on copper sulfide concentrate in 1979,&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"/&gt; using the CSIROâs 50&amp;nbsp;kg Sirosmelt test rig.&lt;ref name = "Floyd, 1980"&gt;J M Floyd, N Grave and B W Lightfoot, "Small pilot plant trials of Sirosmelt copper smelting," In: ''AustraliaâJapan Extractive Metallurgy Symposium, Sydney, Australia, 1980'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1980), 63â74.&lt;/ref&gt; These trials included producing copper matte containing 40â52% copper and, in some cases, converting the matte to produce blister copper.&lt;ref name = "Floyd, 1980"/&gt;

The results of this work were sufficiently encouraging that MIM in 1983&lt;ref name = "Pritchard"&gt;J Pritchard, R L Player and W J Errington, "Isasmelt technology for copper smelting," Technical Paper #A89-5 (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; undertook its own copper smelting test work program using its 120&amp;nbsp;kg/h test rig, which had by then been rerated to 250&amp;nbsp;kg/h.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt; It was found that the process was easy to control and that copper loss to slag was low.&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt; It was also learned that the process could easily recover copper from copper converter slag concentrate, of which there was a large stockpile at Mount Isa.&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt;

==== The copper ISASMELT demonstration plant (1987â1992) ====
Construction of a 15 t/h demonstration copper ISASMELT plant began in 1986. The design was based on MIMâs 250&amp;nbsp;kg/h test work and operating experience with the lead ISASMELT pilot plant.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt; It cost A$11 million&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt; and was commissioned in April 1987.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt; The initial capital cost was recovered in the first 14 months of operation.&lt;ref name = "Bartsch"/&gt;

As with the lead ISASMELT pilot plant, the copper ISASMELT demonstration plant was integrated into copper smelter operations&lt;ref name = "Fewings"/&gt; and justified by the 20% (30,000 t/y) increase in copper production that it provided.&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt; It quickly treated the entire backlog of converter slag concentrate, which could not be treated at high rates in the reverberatory furnaces without generating [[magnetite]] ("Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;") accretions that would necessitate shutting down the reverberatory furnaces for their removal.&lt;ref name = "Casley"&gt;G E Casley, J Middlin and D White, "Recent developments in reverberatory furnace and converter practice at the Mount Isa Mines copper smelter," in: ''Extractive Metallurgy of Copper, Volume 1,'' (The Metallurgical Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1976), 117â138.&lt;/ref&gt;

The demonstration copper ISASMELT plant was used to further develop the copper process. [[Refractory]] life was initially shorter than expected&lt;ref name = "Fountain"&gt;C R Fountain, J M I Tuppurainen and N R Whitworth, "Operation of the copper Isasmelt plants at Mount Isa Mines Limited, Mount Isa, Qld," in: ''Australasian Mining and Metallurgy, The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume, Second Edition'', Eds. J T Woodcock and J K Hamilton (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Melbourne, 1993), 695â700.&lt;/ref&gt; and considerable effort was devoted to understanding the reasons and attempting to extend the life of the refractories.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt; At the end of the life of the demonstration plant, the longest refractory life achieved was 90 weeks.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt;

Lance life was also low initially.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt; Inexperienced operators could destroy a lance in as little as 10 minutes.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt; However, as a result of modifications to the lance design, the development of techniques to determine the position of the lance in the bath, and a rise in the operating experience, the typically lance life was extended to a week.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt;

The demonstration plant was commissioned with high-pressure (700 kPag) air injected down the lance.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt; Later, after extensive testing of low-pressure lance designs and trials using oxygen enrichment of the lance air, a 70 t/d oxygen plant and a 5 Nm3/s blower with a discharge pressure of 146 kPag were purchased.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt; The new lance design was capable of operating at pressures below 100 kPag.&lt;ref name = "Pritchard"/&gt; Using enrichment of the oxygen in the lance air to 35%, the demonstration plant throughput was lifted to 48 t/h of concentrate, and the gross energy used during smelting was reduced from 25.6 GJ/t of contained copper to 4.1 GJ/t.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt;

==== Commercial primary-copper ISASMELT plants (1990â ) ====
The successful operation and development of the demonstration copper ISASMELT, and the degree of interest shown in the new process by the global smelting community, gave MIM Holdings sufficient confidence to license the ISASMELT technology to external companies,&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1999"&gt;W J Errington, P S Arthur and C R Fountain, "Isasmelt â clean, efficient smelting," in: ''Proceedings of Global Conference on Environmental and Metallurgy [sic], GME â99, 24â27 May 1999, Beijing, China'', Eds. D Qiu and Y Chu (International Academic Publishers: Beijing, 1999), 172â164.&lt;/ref&gt; so an agreement under which MIM could incorporate the Sirosmelt lance into ISASMELT technology was signed with the CSIRO in 1989.&lt;ref name = "Bartsch"/&gt;

===== AGIP Australia Pty Ltd =====
MIM signed the first ISASMELT licence agreement with Agip Australia Proprietary Limited ("Agip") in July 1990. Agip, a subsidiary of the Italian oil company [[Eni|ENI]], was developing the Radio Hill nickel-copper deposit near Karratha in Western Australia.&lt;ref name = "Bartsch"/&gt; MIM and representatives of Agip conducted a series of trials in which 4 tonnes of Radio Hill concentrate was smelted in the 250&amp;nbsp;kg/h test rig at Mount Isa.&lt;ref name = "Bartsch"/&gt;

The Agip ISASMELT plant was designed to treat 7.5 t/h of the Radio Hill concentrate and produce 1.5 t/h of granulated matte with a combined nickel and copper content of 45% for sale.,&lt;ref name = "Bartsch"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt; It was the same size as the copper ISASMELT demonstration plant (2.3 m internal diameter) and had a 5.5 Nm3/s blower to provide the lance air.&lt;ref name = "Bartsch"/&gt; Commissioning of the plant began in September 1991;&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; however, the Radio Hill mine and smelter complex were forced to close by low nickel prices after less than six months,&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; before commissioning was completed.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt; The ISASMELT furnace achieved its design capacity within three months.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; Subsequent owners of the mine focussed on mining and mineral processing only, and the ISASMELT plant has been dismantled.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt;

===== Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. =====
In 1973, the [[Freeport-McMoRan]] Copper and Gold Inc. ("Freeport") smelter at [[Miami, Arizona]], installed a 51 MW electric furnace at its Miami smelter. The decision was based on a long-term electrical power contract with the [[Salt River Project]] that provided the company with a very low rate for electricity.&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"/&gt; This contract expired in 1990 and the resulting increase in electricity prices prompted the then owners of the smelter, [[Cyprus Mines Corporation#Later history|Cyprus Miami Mining Corporation]] ("Cyprus"), to seek alternative smelting technologies to provide lower operating costs.&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"/&gt;

The technologies evaluated included the:
* Contop flame cyclone reactor
* [[Flash smelting|Inco flash furnace]]
* ISASMELT
* Mitsubishi furnace
* Noranda reactor
* [[Flash smelting|Outokumpu flash furnace]]
* Teniente furnace.&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"/&gt;
The Contop, Inco, Mitsubishi and Outokumpu processes "were all eliminated primarily because of their high dust levels, high capital costs and poor adaptability to the existing facility". The Teniente converter was ruled out because it required the use of the electric furnace for partial smelting. The Noranda reactor was not selected "because of its high refractory wear and its poor adaptability to the existing plant due to the handling of the reactor slag".&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"/&gt; ISASMELT was chosen as the preferred technology and a licence agreement was signed with MIM in October 1990. The major factor in the decision to select the ISASMELT technology was the ability to fit it into the existing plant and to maximise the use of existing equipment and infrastructure, while the major disadvantage was seen to be the risks associated with scaling up the technology from the Mount Isa demonstration plant.&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"/&gt;

The Miami copper ISASMELT furnace was designed to treat 590,000 t/y (650,000 short tons per year) of copper concentrate, a treatment rate that was constrained by the capacity of the sulfuric acid plant used to capture the sulfur dioxide from the smelterâs waste gases.&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"/&gt; The existing electric furnace was converted from smelting duties to a slag cleaning furnace and providing matte surge capacity for the converters.&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"/&gt; The ISASMELT furnace was commissioned on 11 June 1992 and in 2002 treated over 700,000 t/y of concentrate.&lt;ref name = "Voltura"&gt;S A Voltura, "Continuous improvements at the Phelps Dodge Miami Mining smelter," ''Society of Mining Engineers Annual Meeting, 24â26 February 2004, Denver Colorado'', Preprint 04-78.&lt;/ref&gt; The modernisation of the Miami smelter cost an estimated US$95 million.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt;

In 1993, the Cyprus Minerals Company merged with AMAX to form the [[Cyprus Mines Corporation#Later history|Cyprus Amax Minerals company]], which was in turn taken over by the [[Phelps Dodge]] Corporation in late 1999. Phelps Dodge was acquired by Freeport in 2006.

The Miami smelter is one of only three remaining operating copper smelters in the United States, where there were 16 in 1979.&lt;ref name = "Johnson"&gt;R E Johnson, N J Themelis and G A Eltringham, "A survey of worldwide copper converter practices," in: ''Copper and Nickel Converters'', Ed. R E Johnson (The Metallurgical Society of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers: New York, 1979), 1â32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Mount Isa Mines Limited =====
The third commercial copper ISASMELT plant was installed in MIMâs Mount Isa copper smelter at a cost of approximately A$100 million.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt; It was designed to treat 104 t/h of copper concentrate, containing 180,000 t/y of copper, and it began operation in August 1992.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt;

A significant difference between the Mount Isa copper ISASMELT plant and all the others is that it uses an Ahlstrom Fluxflow&lt;sup&gt;Â®&lt;/sup&gt; waste heat boiler&lt;ref name = "Peippo"&gt;R Peippo, H Holopainen and J Nokelainen, "Copper smelter waste heat boiler technology for the next millennium," in: ''Proceedings of Copper â99-Cobre â99 International Conference, Volume VâSmelting Operations and Advances'', Eds. D B George, W J Chen, P J Mackey and A J Weddick (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1999), 71â82.&lt;/ref&gt; to recover heat from the furnace waste gas. This boiler uses a recirculating fluid bed of particles to rapidly quench the gas as it leaves the furnace, and then uses the enhanced heat transfer properties of solidâsolid contact to cool the particles as they are carried past boiler tubes that are suspended in a shaft above the bed.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt; The high heat transfer rate means that the Fluxflow&lt;sup&gt;Â®&lt;/sup&gt; boiler is relatively compact compared with conventional waste heat boilers and the rapid cooling of the waste gas limits the formation of sulfur trioxide ("SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;"), which in the presence of water forms sulfuric acid that can cause corrosion of cool surfaces.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1997"&gt;W J Errington, J S Edwards and P Hawkins, "Isasmelt technologyâcurrent status and future development," ''The Journal of the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy'', JulyâAugust 1997, 161â168. http://www.saimm.co.za/Journal/v097n04p161.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mount Isa copper smelter 2002.jpg|thumbnail|Mount Isa copper smelter in 2002. The building beneath the left-hand crane is the ISASMELT plant.]]

In the early years of operation, the Fluxflow&lt;sup&gt;Â®&lt;/sup&gt; boiler was the cause of significant down time, because the rate of wear of the boiler tubes was much higher than expected.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1997"/&gt; The problems were solved by understanding the gas flows within the boiler redesigning the boiler tubes to minimise the effects of erosion.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1997"/&gt;

The life of the refractory bricks in the ISASMELT furnace was initially shorter than expected and a water cooling system was briefly considered to extend them;&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1997"/&gt; however, this was not installed and operational improvements have resulted in a significant extension of the life of the lining without this capital and operating expense.&lt;ref name = "Fountain, 2002"&gt;C R Fountain, "Isasmelt and IsaMillsâmodels of successful R&amp;D," in: ''Young Leadersâ Conference, Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, 19â21 March 2002'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2002), 1â12.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1998, the refractory lining lives have exceeded the two-year design life,&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; with lives of the 8th and 9th linings almost reaching three years.&lt;ref name = "Burford"&gt;B Burford, "The ISASMELT technology package: over 30 years of innovation," ''The AusIMM Bulletin'', February 2009, 26â30.&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent lining lasted for 50 months, with the one before that lasting for 44 months.&lt;ref&gt;[https://industryadvocate.com.au/smelter-shutdown-record-in-sight/ "Smelter shutdown record in sight,"] ''Queensland Industry Advocate'', 26 May 2014. Viewed 3 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first years of operation at Mount Isa, the throughput of the ISASMELT furnace was constrained by problems with some of the ancillary equipment in the plant, including the boiler, slag granulation system and concentrate filters.&lt;ref name = "Fountain, 2002"/&gt; The ultimate constraint was the decision during its construction to keep one of the two reverberatory furnaces on line to increase the copper smelter production to 265,000 t/y of anode copper. The smelterâs Peirce-Smith converters became a bottleneck and the feed rate of the ISASMELT furnace had to be restrained to allow sufficient matte to be drawn from the reverberatory furnace to prevent it freezing solid.&lt;ref name = "Bill, 2002"/&gt; The ISASMELT 12-month rolling average of the feed rate fell just short of 100 t/h for much of this period, not quite reaching the design annual average of 104 t/h.&lt;ref name = "Fountain, 2002"/&gt; MIM decided to shut down the reverberatory furnace in 1997, and the ISASMELT plant 12-month rolling mean feed rate quickly exceeded the 104 t/h design when this constraint was lifted.&lt;ref name = "Fountain, 2002"/&gt;

The performance of the ISASMELT plant was sufficiently encouraging that MIM decided to expand the ISASMELT treatment rate to 166 t/h by adding a second oxygen plant to allow higher enrichment of the lance air.&lt;ref name = "Fountain, 2002"/&gt; As a result, by late 2001 it had achieve a peak rate of 190 t/h of concentrate, and the smelter produced a peak annual total of 240,000 t of anode copper.&lt;ref name = "Fountain, 2002"/&gt; At that time, the Mount Isa copper smelter, together with its copper refinery in Townsville, was among the lowest cost copper smelters in the world.

Lance life is typically two weeks, with lance changes taking 30 to 40 minutes, and repairs usually being limited to replacement of the lance tips.&lt;ref name = "Gao"&gt;M Gao, P S Arthur and N Aslin, [http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Publications/Technical%20Papers/XT_ISASMELT_Paper_Hainan%20conference%20EN_2.pdf "Proven technologies from Xstrata and their applications for copper smelting and refining in China,"] paper presented at Hainan Conference, China.

[[Sterlite Industries]] ("Sterlite"), now a subsidiary of [[Vedanta Resources]] plc ("Vedanta"), built a copper smelter in [[Thoothukudi|Tuticorin]] using an ISASMELT furnace and [[Converting (metallurgy)#Equipment|Peirce-Smith converters]]. The smelter was commissioned in 1996&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt; and was designed to produce 60,000 t/y of copper (450,000 t/y of copper concentrate),&lt;ref name = "Burford"/&gt; but by increasing the oxygen content of the lance air and making modifications to other equipment, the ISASMELT furnace feed rate was increased to the point where the smelter was producing 180,000 t/y of copper.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt;

Sterlite commissioned a new ISASMELT furnace in May 2005&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2006"/&gt; that was designed to treat 1.3 million t/y of copper concentrate,&lt;ref name = "Burford"/&gt; and the smelterâs production capacity was expanded to 300,000 t/y of copper.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; The new plant reached its design capacity, measured over a three-month period, six months after it started treating its first feed.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2006"/&gt; Vedantaâs website states that the new ISASMELT furnace was successfully ramped up "in a record period of 45 days".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sterlite-industries.com/about_us/Our_History.aspx Sterlite Industries - Our history]. Accessed 20 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then Sterlite has decided to further expand its copper production by installing a third ISASMELT smelter and new refinery using IsaKidd technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Installations/Pages/SterliteIndustriesCopperSmelter.aspx Sterlite plant]. Accessed 20 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The new smelter will have a design capacity of 1.36 million t/y of copper concentrate (containing 400,000 t/y of copper), processed through a single ISASMELT furnace.&lt;ref name = "Alvear, 2010"&gt;G R F Alvear, P S Arthur and P Partington, [http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Publications/Technical%20Papers/Alvear.pdf "Feasibility to profitability with copper ISASMELT,"] in: ''Proceedings of Copper 2010, Hamburg, Germany, 6â10 June 2010''. Accessed 21 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Yunnan Copper Corporation Limited =====
In the 1990s, the Chinese government decided to increase the efficiency of the Chinese economy and reduce the environmental effects of heavy industry by modernising plants.&lt;ref name = "Li, 2003"/&gt; As a response, the Yunnan Copper Corporation Limited ("YCC") upgraded its existing plant, which was based on a sinter plant and an electric furnace, with a copper ISASMELT furnace.&lt;ref name = "Li, 2003"/&gt; As with the Miami smelter, the electric furnace was converted from smelting duty to separation of matte and slag and providing matte surge capacity for the converters, and again, the small footprint of the ISASMELT furnace was very important in retrofitting it to the existing smelter.&lt;ref name = "Li, 2003"/&gt;

The YCC ISASMELT plant had a design capacity of 600,000 dry t/y of copper concentrate and started smelting concentrate on 15 May 2002.&lt;ref name = "Li, 2003"/&gt; YCC placed a lot of emphasis on training its operators, sending people to Mount Isa for training over a seven-month period during 2001 ahead of the ISASMELT commissioning.&lt;ref name = "Li, 2003"/&gt; The total cost of the smelter modernisation program, including the ISASMELT furnace, was 640 million yuan (approximately US$80 million) and the smelterâs concentrate treatment rate increased from 470,000 t/y to 800,000 t/y as a result.&lt;ref name = "Shi"&gt;Y F Shi, "Yunnan Copperâs Isasmelt â successful smelter modernization in China," in: ''Sohn International Symposium on Advanced Processing of Metals and Materials, Volume 8 â International Symposium on Sulfide Smelting 2006'', Eds. F. Kongoli and R G Reddy (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 2006), 151â162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The transfer of operating knowledge from MIM to YCC was sufficient for the first ISASMELT furnace refractory lining to last for two years, a marked improvement on the life of the initial lining of other plants.&lt;ref name = "Shi"/&gt;

YCC described the modernisation project as "a great success, achieving all that was expected."&lt;ref name = "Shi"/&gt; Energy consumption per tonne of blister copper produced decreased by 34% as a result of installing the ISASMELT furnace, and YCC estimated that during the first 38 months of operation, it saved approximately US$31.4 million through reduced energy costs alone,&lt;ref name = "Shi"/&gt; giving the modernisation a very short payback by industry standards.

In 2004, YCCâs management was presented with awards for Innovation in Project Management and the National Medal for High Quality Projects by the Chinese government to mark the success of the smelter modernisation project.&lt;ref name = "Shi"/&gt;

Xstrata subsequently licensed YCC to build three more ISASMELT plants, one in Chuxiong in Yunnan Province, China to treat 500,000 t/y of copper concentrate, one in Liangshan in Sichuan Province, China&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt; and the other in Chambishi in Zambia to treat 350,000 t/y of concentrate.&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt; Chuxiong and Chambishi were commissioned in 2009.&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt; Liangshan was commissioned in 2012.&lt;ref name = "XT"/&gt;

===== Mopani Copper Mines plc =====
[[Mopani Copper Mine]]s ("Mopani") was part of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Limited until it was privatised in 2000. It owns the Mufulira smelter, which operated with an electric furnace with a nominal capacity of 420,000 t/y of copper concentrate (180,000 t/y of new copper).&lt;ref name = "Ross"&gt;J Ross and D de Vries, [http://www.isasmelt.com/downloads/XTpaper_Mopani_MSUPyromet05.pdf "Mufulira smelter upgrade project â "Industryâ smelting on the Zambian Copperbelt."] Accessed 9 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Mopani decided to install a copper ISASMELT plant that could treat 850,000 t/y of copper concentrate, including a purpose-designed electric matte settling furnace to separate the ISASMELT matte and slag and also return slag from the smelterâs Peirce-Smith converters.&lt;ref name = "Ross"/&gt;

Before committing to the ISASMELT technology, Mopani considered the following process options:
* an electric furnace
* a flash furnace, including one operating direct-to-blister
* the Mitsubishi smelting process
* the Teniente converter
* the Noranda reactor
* an Ausmelt furnace
* an ISASMELT furnace.&lt;ref name = "Ross"/&gt;
Mopani considered electric furnaces unproven at the proposed concentrate feed rates, and the low sulfur dioxide concentration in the waste gas would make its capture very expensive.&lt;ref name = "Ross"/&gt; Flash furnaces and the Mitsubishi process were excluded because:
* they were considered too technically complex for the Zambian environment
* they were not well suited for retrofitting to the Mufulira smelter
* they had a high capital cost associated with them.&lt;ref name = "Ross"/&gt;
Mopani excluded the Teniente converter and Noranda reactor because of the poor performance of the Teniente converter at the other Zambian smelter operating at the time and because of "the relatively inexperienced technical resources available at the time".&lt;ref name = "Ross"/&gt;

Mopani selected ISASMELT technology over Ausmelt technology after visits to operating plants in Australia, the United States of America, and China.&lt;ref name = "Ross"/&gt; The total cost of the project was US$213 million. The first feed was smelted in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Installations/Pages/MopaniCopperMinesCopperSmelter.aspx Mopani Isasmelt plant.] Accessed 21 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Southern Peru Copper Corporation =====
The [[Southern Peru Copper Corporation]] ("SPCC") is a subsidiary of the [[Southern Copper Corporation]] ("SCC"), one of the worldâs largest copper companies&lt;ref name = "Walqui"&gt;H Walqui and C Noriega, "Design, construction and start-up of the Ilo smelter modernization project," presented at the ''Society of Mining Engineers Annual Meeting, 25â28 February 2007, Denver, Colorado''. Preprint 07â081.&lt;/ref&gt; and currently 75.1% owned by Grupo MÃ©xico. Grupo MÃ©xico acquired the shares in SPCC when it bought ASARCO in November 1999&lt;ref name = "Samaniego"/&gt;

In the 1990s, SPCC was seeking to modernise its smelter at Ilo in southern Peru as part of 1997 commitment to the Peruvian government to capture at least 91.7% of the sulfur dioxide generated in its smelting operations by January 2007.&lt;ref name = "Walqui"/&gt; It initially selected flash smelting technology to replace its reverberatory furnaces, at a cost of almost US$1 billion;&lt;ref name = "Samaniego"/&gt; however, one of the first actions following Grupo MÃ©xicoâs acquisition of ASARCO was to review the proposed Ilo smelter modernisation plans.&lt;ref name = "Samaniego"/&gt;

Six different technologies were evaluated during the review. These were:
* Outokumpu flash smelting
* the Mitsubishi process
* the Noranda reactor
* ISASMELT
* Ausmelt
* the Teniente converter.&lt;ref name = "Walqui"/&gt;
The ISASMELT technology was selected as a result of the review, resulting in a reduction in the capital cost of almost 50% and was also the alternative with the lowest operating costs.&lt;ref name = "Samaniego"/&gt;

The plant was commissioned in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Installations/Pages/SouthernPeruCopperCorporationCopperSmelter.aspx SPCC Isasmelt plant.] Accessed 21 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, the plant had an average feed rate of 165.2 t/h of concentrate and 6.3 t/h of reverts (cold copper-bearing materials that arise from spillage and accretions in the pots used to transport matte or other molten materials).&lt;ref name = "Alvear, 2010"/&gt;

SPCC has reported a cost of approximately $600 million for the smelter modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Southern Copper Corporation, "Southern Copper Corporation completed the modernization of its Ilo smelter," Press Release, 1 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Kazzinc =====
[[Kazzinc]] selected the copper ISASMELT process for its [[Ust-Kamenogorsk]] metallurgical complex. It is designed to treat 290,000 t/y of copper concentrate&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt; and was commissioned in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kazzinc.com/#en/Operations/Organization of operations/Ust-Kamenogorsk/. Organisation of operations at Ust-Kamenogorsk.] Accessed 21 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A projected capital cost for the smelter and refinery in 2006 was US$178 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metalresourcesdirectory.com/articles/kazakh-kazzinc-to-build-copper-smelter-in-ust-kamenogorsk.html "Kazakh Kazzinc to build copper smelter at Ust-Kamenogorsk], 23 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== First Quantum Minerals =====
In the fourth quarter of 2011, the [[First Quantum Minerals]] board approved the construction of an ISASMELT-based smelter at Kansanshi in Zambia.&lt;ref name = "FQM 4Q"&gt;First Quantum Minerals Ltd, [http://www.first-quantum.com/files/doc_financials/2011%20FQM%20Financial%20Statements%20and%20Q4%20MDA.pdf "Consolidated Financial Statements, December 31, 2011, December 31 2010 and January 1, 2010".] Accessed 22 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The smelter is to process 1.2 million t/y of copper concentrate to produce over 300,000 t/y of copper and 1.1 million t/y of sulfuric acid as a by-product.&lt;ref name = "FQM 4Q"/&gt; Construction is expected to be completed by mid-2014,&lt;ref name = "FQM PR"&gt;[http://www.first-quantum.com/default.aspx?SectionId=5cc5ecae-6c48-4521-a1ad-480e593e4835&amp;LanguageId=1&amp;PressReleaseId=cc391e4d-0c43-4ff9-b97e-42e68679c184 First Quantum press release.] Accessed 22 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and the capital cost is estimated at US$650 million.&lt;ref name = "FQM IP"&gt;[http://www.first-quantum.com/files/doc_presentations/Presentation%20-%20December%20-%20FINAL.pdf First Quantum investor presentation, December 2012.] Accessed 10 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated operating cost was given as US$69 per tonne of concentrate.&lt;ref name = "FQM IP"/&gt;

The Kansanshi copper smelter project is estimated to be worth US$340â500 million per year in reduced concentrate freight costs, export duties and sulfuric acid costs.&lt;ref name = "FQM 4Q"/&gt;

==== Commercial secondary-copper ISASMELT plants ====
In addition to treating copper concentrates, ISASMELT furnaces have also been built to treat secondary (scrap) copper materials.

===== Umicore N.V. =====
In the early 1990s, technical personnel from the then [[Umicore|Union MiniÃ©re]] worked with MIM Holdings personnel to develop an ISASMELT-based process to treat scrap materials and residues containing copper and lead.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1999"/&gt; Union MiniÃ©re operated a smelter at [[Hoboken, Antwerp|Hoboken]], near [[Antwerp]]en in [[Belgium]], that specialised in recycling scrap non-ferrous materials. The test work program was undertaken using an ISASMELT test rig at MIM Holdingsâ lead refinery, Britannia Refined Metals, at [[Northfleet]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1999"/&gt;

A demonstration plant was designed by MIM Holdings personnel and operated for several months at the Hoboken smelter site.&lt;ref name = "Edwards, 2007"&gt;J S Edwards and G R F Alvear, "Converting using ISASMELT technology," in: ''Cu2007 â Volume III (Book 2): The Carlos DÃ­az Symposium on Pyrometallurgy'', Eds. A R M Warner, C J Newman, A Vahed, D B George, P J Mackey and A Warczok (Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum: Westmount, Quebec, 2007), 17â28.&lt;/ref&gt; The new smelter was commissioned in the final quarter of 1997&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1999"/&gt; and in 2007 was treating up to 300,000 t/y of secondary materials.&lt;ref name = "Edwards, 2007"/&gt; The installation of the ISASMELT furnace replaced "a large number of unit processes" and substantially reduced operating costs at the Hoboken smelter.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2006"/&gt;

Umicoreâs Hoboken plant uses a two-step process in a single furnace. The first step involves the oxidation of the feed to form a copper matte and a lead-rich slag. The slag is then tapped and the remaining copper matte is then converted to blister copper.&lt;ref name = "Edwards, 2007"/&gt; The lead-rich slag is subsequently reduced in a blast furnace to produce lead metal, while the copper is refined and the contained precious metals recovered.&lt;ref name = "Edwards, 2007"/&gt;

===== Aurubis AG =====
The then HÃ¼ttenwerke Kayser smelter at [[LÃ¼nen]] in Germany installed an ISASMELT plant in 2002 to replace three blast furnaces and one Peirce-Smith converter used for smelting scrap copper.&lt;ref name = "Edwards, 2007"/&gt; The company was subsequently bought by [[Aurubis#History|Norddeutsche Affinerie AG]], which in turn became [[Aurubis]] AG.

The process used at the LÃ¼nen smelter involves charging the furnace with copper residues and scrap containing between 1 and 80% copper and then melting it in a reducing environment. This produces a "black copper phase" and a low-copper silica slag. Initially the black copper was converted to blister copper in the ISASMELT furnace.&lt;ref name = "Edwards, 2007"/&gt; However, in 2011 the smelter was expanded as part of the "KRS Plus" project. A top-blown rotary converter is now used to convert the black copper and the ISASMELT furnace runs continuously in smelting mode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aurubis.com/en/responsibility/environment/production-sites/luenen "Arubis' achievements at the LÃ¼nen production site."] Accessed 26 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G R F Alvear, A S Burrows and S Nikolic, [http://www.expomin.cl/marketing/pdf/2012/presentacion_gerardo_alvear.pdf "Modern, flexible and clean technologies for recovery and recycling of valuable materials,"] ''2nd International Workshop on Recovery of Metals from Mining Waste, M2R2, Santiago, Chile, 12â13 April 2012''. Accessed 26 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The installation of the ISASMELT furnace increased the overall copper recovery in the plant by reducing losses to slag, reduced the number of furnaces in operation, decreased the waste gas volume, and decreased energy consumption by more than 50%. The production capacity exceeds the original design by 40%.&lt;ref name = "Edwards, 2007"/&gt;

[[File:Illusory discontinuity stimulus.wav|thumb|Example of illusory discontinuity stimulus: continuous tone with spectrally remote noise. The tone sounds discontinuous to some listeners.]]

'''Illusory discontinuity''' is an [[auditory illusion]] in which a continuous ongoing sound becomes inaudible during a brief, non-masking noise.  The illusion is perceived only by some listeners, but not by others, reflecting individual variation in hearing abilities. It has been estimated that among young adults 24% are susceptible to illusory discontinuity.&lt;ref name="PlosOne"&gt;Vinnik E, Itskov PM, Balaban E  (2011). "[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0017266 Individual differences in sound-in-noise perception are related to the strength of short-latency neural responses to noise]." PLoS One. 6(2): e17266. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0017266}}. {{PMID|21387016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most susceptible listeners describe their sensations in terms of the sound actually containing a physical gap. 
The illusory discontinuity is strongest when the interrupting sound is short (50[[Millisecond|ms]]). Longer sounds elicit weaker illusory discontinuity; this effect may be related to better auditory segregation.&lt;ref name="Thesis"&gt;[https://digitallibrary.sissa.it/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1963/6179/PhD_Vinnik.pdf?sequence=1 Sounds in noise: Behavioral and neural studies of illusory continuity and discontinuity. Vinnik, Ekaterina PhD thesis, SISSA, 2009-11-02]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to other auditory illusions ==

Illusory discontinuity is antagonistic with [[illusory continuity of tones]] (auditory [[filling-in]]). While [[Illusory continuity of tones|illusory continuity]] restores perceptual continuity of obscured sounds, illusory discontinuity disrupts the perception even if the sound is indeed continuous. Listeners strongly susceptible to illusory discontinuity do not perceive illusory auditory continuity .

== Relation to auditory masking ==

The illusion is likely to be a novel form of informational masking (broadly defined as a degradation of auditory detection or discrimination of a signal embedded in a context of other similar sounds).&lt;ref name="Maskingpaper"&gt;Leek MR, Brown ME, Dorman MF (1991) Informational masking and auditory attention. Percept Psychophys. 50(3):205-14 {{PMID|1754361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illusory discontinuity cannot be explained by simultaneous [[Auditory masking|masking]], because it appears even if the noise is as far  as one octave away.

== Relation to auditory stream segregation ==

It has been suggested that illusory discontinuity is related to inability to segregate the ongoing sound from the interrupting noise,&lt;ref name="Thesis" /&gt; although more research is needed to prove this.

== Physiology ==

The mechanism of the illusory discontinuity is unknown. An [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalographic]] study has demonstrated that participants who were not prone to illusory discontinuity showed robust early neural responses at 40â66 ms after noise burst onset, whereas those prone to the illusion lacked these early responses.&lt;ref name="PlosOne" /&gt; This suggests that the individual variability in perceiving discontinuity illusion is related to neural processing of the interrupting sound.

'''Institut Pasteur Korea''' is an infectious disease-focused research institute located in [[Gyeonggi Province]], Rep. of Korea. Its [http://www.pasteur.or.kr/profile/index.php?mNum=0&amp;c_seq=0 mission]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasteur.or.kr/ Official website of Institut Pasteur Korea]. Retrieved 7 October 2010.  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v03Tba1Q?url=http://www.pasteur.or.kr/ |date=15 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is to identify novel molecular targets and discover small molecules by utilizing its proprietary platforms to diagnose, treat and address serious unmet global public health needs.

It was inaugurated as a nonprofit private research institute on 12 April 2004&lt;ref&gt;âConclusion on General Agreement for Establishment of Institut Pasteur Koreaâ
KIST Newsletter No. 294, January 26, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; as a collaboration between the [[Institut Pasteur]] in Paris and [[Korea Institute of Science and Technology]] (KIST) in Seoul and it is supported by the Korean government through the [[Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning]]  (former Ministry of Science and Technology)&lt;ref name="Jae-Eun Lee 2004"&gt;Jae-Eun Lee, Gi-jung Chun, "The Key Success Factors of the Policy Implementation for the Government Innovation: Inducing Policy of the French Institute Pasteur", Korean Policy Sciences Review, Vol. 8, Nov.4 (December 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and Gyeonggi Province.

Institut Pasteur Korea has been a key driver of early drug discovery among the 33 members of the Institut Pasteur International Network located in 26 countries on 5 continents, including China, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Korea within Asia.

Institut Pasteur Korea provides fundamental technologies and tools to bridge between Korean and international bio-pharma science. For more than a decade, it has integrated [[biology]], [[IT]] and [[chemistry]] to develop innovative imaging technologies for [[high-throughput screening]]; resulting in discovery of a new best-in-class molecule to fight [[tuberculosis]] (TB). Institut Pasteur Korea is also focused on discovery biology to study and understand TB and on the development of new and more effective ways to diagnose and treat the disease. Leveraging its unique drug discovery capabilities and global partnerships, Institut Pasteur Korea also tackles antibacterial resistance, [[Hepatitis C virus|HCV]], [[Hepatitis B virus|HBV]], [[influenza]], [[leishmaniasis]], [[dengue fever]] and [[cancer]].

The Institute is housed in a purpose-built facility in the city of [[Pangyo, Seongnam|Pangyo]] in Gyeonggi Province, 20&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Seoul]].

==Origins==

Institut Pasteur Korea was established by collaboration between [[Institut Pasteur]]  and [[Korea Institute of Science and Technology|KIST]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasteur.fr/actu/presse/press/03_IPKorea_E.html Creation of the Institut Pasteur of Korea]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v03UfCJe?url=http://www.pasteur.fr/actu/presse/press/03_IPKorea_E.html |date=December 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institut Pasteur is a private foundation dedicated to the study of biology, [[microorganisms]], diseases and vaccines. It is named after [[Louis Pasteur]], its founder and first director, who successfully developed the first anti-rabies serum in 1885. KIST, founded in 1966, was the first multi-disciplinary scientific research institute in Korea and has contributed significantly to the economic development of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Moo-Young Han, "Annotated Chronology of Korea's Science and Technology: From Rice Paddies to Flat Panel Displays" {{cite web |url=http://www.duke.edu/~myhan/kaf0401.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v03VQJHW?url=http://www.duke.edu/~myhan/kaf0401.html |archivedate=December 15, 2010 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, two major agreements between Institut Pasteur Paris and KIST paved the way for the launch of Institut Pasteur Korea. One established financial arrangements for the operation of the institute; the other was a general agreement on its foundation and management. Institut Pasteur Korea was mandated to expand the reach of Institut Pasteur by moving [[basic research]] toward [[therapy]] development and to introduce the âPasteurianâ research mission, management and culture to Korea.&lt;ref name="Jae-Eun Lee 2004"/&gt; Over its 130-year history, the Institut Pasteur in Paris has combined scientific achievements with their application in public health.

Institut Pasteur Korea was inaugurated in April 2004. Operations began at the start of 2005 under the motto âFrom Drug to Genesâ, with the mission of turning basic research into pharmaceuticals using âtarget-freeâ drug discovery. Using this approach, drugs are sought in a cellular context, with no preconceived notions of what targets within the cell are relevant.

Institut Pasteur Korea joined the [http://www.web.pasteur.fr/ip/easysite/pasteur-international-en/institut-pasteur-international-network/the-network Institut Pasteur International Network] in November 2004 as a private foundation recognized as working toward the public good through biomedical research.

Until April 2009 Institut Pasteur Korea was located in a small facility on the campus of KIST. It then moved into a new 15,199 square meter facility in Pangyo, Gyeonggi Province.  The institute is one of the few in the world that contains robotic, high throughput optical imaging capacity within [[biosafety level]] 2 and 3 facilities.

==Vision and Strategy==

With the excellence of its multinational scientists and staff, the cutting-edge translational-driven research innovations, the strong affiliation with Institut Pasteur Paris and its global network of 33 institutes, and the commitment to making a difference in people's lives according to the teachings of Dr. Louis Pasteur, Institut Pasteur Korea aims to be one of the premier research institutions in Korea.

Institut Pasteur Korea focuses on five key objectives to accelerate the discovery phase for a multitude of infectious diseases:

1) Build a fundamental understanding of the biology of the disease.

2) Deploy discovery platforms to search for novel host molecular target(s) for intervention and diagnosis; and identify novel compounds to treat the disease.

3) Facilitate the transition from discovery to translation through chemistry optimization and asset valorization efforts.

4) Identify the right industrial partner for further development and commercialization of diagnostic kits for earlier detection and prevention; and novel small molecule therapies for immediate treatment and disease spread control.

5) Develop and mentor the research leaders of tomorrow through targeted recruitment and retention of rising stars, combined with academic outreach programs, such as Pasteur Jr. and Institut Pasteur Korea Life Science programs.

==Organization==

Institut Pasteur Korea is organized into four divisions, Research Technology Management, Discovery Biology, Discovery Chemistry and Administration. These functional units collaborate across disciplines and classical research boundaries, providing an effective operational organization to meet the strategic goals of the institute.

==Research and Technology==

Institut Pasteur Koreaâs research groups study infectious diseases including [[tuberculosis]], antibacterial resistance, [[Hepatitis C virus|HCV]], [[Hepatitis B virus|HBV]], [[influenza]], [[leishmaniasis]], and [[dengue fever]], as well as [[cancer]].

For over a decade, Institut Pasteur Korea has focused on technology development to build the best drug discovery platform for high-content screening performed in BSL level 2 and 3 environments. Its innovative screening platform utilizes target-free, visual high-content screening using large compound libraries or siRNA libraries to identify chemical compounds that prevent or slow disease progression in live, physiologically relevant disease models. Its core technology features automated cellular imaging-based, high-content screening facilities with a capacity to screen up to 2 million points (independent compounds or [[RNAi]]) per year.

Institut Pasteur Koreaâs target identification technology uses high-content, genome-wide visual arrays to identify targets of interest in live cellular disease models. By screening with siRNA libraries, researchers can identify genes that alter drug sensitivity in the cellular disease model, thereby providing a way to quickly close in on the molecular targets.

Institut Pasteur Koreaâs Discovery Chemistry group applies new concepts of drug design to optimize hit-to-lead identification. Its drug discovery technology platforms have led to the first-ever TB chemical screen performed using primary macrophages and resulting in a new best-in-class molecule to fight TB, referred to as Q203.

==Business Development==

Institut Pasteur Korea actively promotes knowledge sharing and collaboration with international and domestic scientific communities and it is committed to sharing the fruits of our research, technologies and expertise with partners and young scientists.

The positive reputation of Institut Pasteur Korea and its technology in the international pharmaceutical community has led to collaborations with multiple global partners. Also of significance, Institut Pasteur Korea entered the Korean market by establishing a privileged partnership with major pharmaceuticals. The formation of these collaborations is an important milestone for the development of further business relationships in the pharmaceutical arena.

Additionally, [http://www.qurient.com, Qurient, Co. Ltd.] is a spinoff company that serves as a virtual drug development center, using [[contract research organization]]s to bring small molecules generated by Institut Pasteur Korea into [[clinical trials]]. The goal of Qurient is to license out lead compounds discovered at Institut Pasteur Korea for clinical development and commercialization by larger partners in the biotech and pharmaceuticals sector.

==Financial Support==

Institut Pasteur Korea is funded through Korean government subsidies from the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning and Gyeonggi Province, domestic and international grants, revenues from industry sponsored research and license agreements, and donations.

'''Jakob Rosenberg''' (1893 â 1980) was a German-US art historian and [[Rembrandt]] scholar.

Rosenberg was born in [[Berlin]] into a family of art dealers and in the years 1912-1914 he first did an internship in the art trade in Munich. After serving in WWI he was captured by the British in 1915 and was sent to Switzerland by prisoner exchange. After the war he studied art history in Bern and Zurich, then in Frankfurt and Munich, where he received his doctorate under [[Heinrich WÃ¶lfflin]]. He then worked for [[Max J. Friedlander]] in the Berlin print cabinet ''[[Kupferstichkabinett Berlin]]'', where he also had contact with [[Wilhelm von Bode]]. In 1935 he beame a curator there but was dismissed the same year for racial reasons. After a visit to Harvard in 1936, Jakob Rosenberg emigrated to the United States in 1937, where he was admitted to Harvard University through Adolph Goldschmidt and his friend Paul Sachs. He was first a research fellow and lecturer, in 1940 associate professor and in 1947 full professor. His 1948 overview work on Rembrandt was reprinted in 1964 and 1968, holding its own as a standard work during the early years of the [[Rembrandt Research Project]]. He was also director of the Graphic Collection of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] from 1939.

In 1954 he was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

Jacob Rosenberg married Elisabeth Husserl, the daughter of [[Edmund Husserl]], in 1922.

Rosenberg died in [[Cambridge]].

'''Charles-Ãdouard Jeanneret''' (6 October 1887 â 27 August 1965), known as '''Le Corbusier''' ({{IPA-fr|lÉ kÉÊbyËzje|lang}}), was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]]-[[French people|French]] architect, designer, painter, [[urban planner]], writer, and one of the pioneers of what is now called [[modern architecture]]. He was born in [[Switzerland]] and became a [[France|French citizen]] in 1930. His career spanned five decades, and he designed buildings in Europe, Japan, India, and North and South America.

Dedicated to providing better living conditions for the residents of crowded cities, Le Corbusier was influential in [[urban planning]], and was a founding member of the [[CongrÃ¨s International d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM). Le Corbusier prepared the master plan for the city of [[Chandigarh]] in [[India]], and contributed specific designs for several buildings there.

On 17 July 2016, seventeen projects by Le Corbusier in seven countries were inscribed in the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites as [[The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier|The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1528/|title=The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life (1887â1904)==
[[File:Le Corbusier (Charles-Ãdouard Jeanneret), 1920, Still Life, oil on canvas, 80.9 x 99.7 cm, Museum of Modern Art.jpg|thumb|Le Corbusier (Charles-Ãdouard Jeanneret), 1920, ''Nature morte'' (''Still Life''), oil on canvas, {{convert|80.9|x|99.7|cm|1|abbr=on}}, [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York]]

Charles-Ãdouard Jeanneret was born on 6 October 1887 in [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]], a small city in the French-speaking [[Canton of NeuchÃ¢tel|NeuchÃ¢tel canton]] in north-western Switzerland, in the [[Jura mountains]], just {{convert|5|km|mi}} across the border from France. It was an industrial town, devoted to the manufacture of watches. (He adopted the pseudonym of ''Le Corbusier'' in 1920.) His father was an artisan who enameled boxes and watches, while his mother gave piano lessons. His elder brother Albert was an amateur violinist.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=32}}  He attended a kindergarten that used [[Friedrich FrÃ¶bel|FrÃ¶belian]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Solitaire, Le Corbusier et l'urbain â la rectification du damier froebelien, pp. 93â117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Actes du colloque La ville et l'urbanisme aprÃ¨s Le Corbusier, Ã©ditions d'en Haut 1993 â {{ISBN|2-88251-033-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Solitaire, Le Corbusier entre Raphael et FrÃ¶bel, pp. 9â27, Journal d'histoire de l'architecture NÂ°1, Presses universitaires de Grenoble 1988 â {{ISBN|2-7061-0325-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like his contemporaries [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Mies van der Rohe]], Le Corbusier did not have formal academic training as an architect.  He was attracted to the visual arts and at the age of fifteen he entered the municipal art school in La-Chaux-de-Fonds which taught the applied arts connected with watchmaking.  Three years later he attended the higher course of decoration, founded by the painter [[Charles L'Eplattenier]], who had studied in [[Budapest]] and Paris. Le Corbusier wrote later that L'Eplattenier had made him "a man of the woods" and taught him painting from nature.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=32}}  His father took him frequently into the mountains around the town.  He wrote later, "we were constantly on mountaintops; we grew accustomed to a vast horizon."&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''L'Art dÃ©coratif d'aujourdhui'' (1925), p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; His architecture teacher in the Art School was the architect RenÃ© Chapallaz, who had a large influence on Le Corbusier's earliest house designs.  However, he reported later that it was the art teacher L'Eplattenier who made him choose architecture. "I had a horror of architecture and architects," he wrote. "...I was sixteen, I accepted the verdict and I obeyed.  I moved into architecture."&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Jean Petit, ''Le Corbusier lui-meme'',  Rousseau, Geneva 1970, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel and first houses (1905â1914)==

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Le Corbusier began teaching himself by going to the library to read about architecture and philosophy, by visiting museums, by sketching buildings, and by constructing them.  In 1905, he and two other students, under the supervision of their teacher, RenÃ© Chapallaz, designed and built his first house, the Villa Fallet, for the engraver Louis Fallet, a friend of his teacher Charles L'Eplattenier. Located on the forested hillside near Chaux-de-fonds. It was a large chalet with a steep roof in the local alpine style and carefully-crafted colored geometric patterns on the faÃ§ade.  The success of this house led to his construction of two similar houses, the Villas Jacquemet and Stotzer, in the same area.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=49}}

In September 1907, he made his first trip outside of Switzerland, going to Italy; then that winter traveling through Budapest to Vienna, where he stayed for four months and met [[Gustav Klimt]] and tried, without success, to meet [[Josef Hoffmann]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=48}}  In Florence, he visited the [[Florence Charterhouse]] in [[Galluzzo]], which made a lifelong impression on him. "I would have liked to live in one of what they called their cells,"  he wrote later. "It was the solution for a unique kind of worker's housing, or rather for a terrestrial paradise."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Eplattenier in Dumont, ''Le Corbusier, ''Lettres a ses maitres'', vol. 2, pp. 82â83.&lt;/ref&gt;  He traveled to Paris, and during fourteen months between 1908 until 1910 he worked as a draftsman in the office of the architect [[Auguste Perret]], the pioneer of the use of reinforced [[concrete]] in residential construction and the architect of the [[Art Deco]] landmark [[ThÃ©Ã¢tre des Champs-ÃlysÃ©es]].  Two years later, between October 1910 and March 1911, he traveled to Germany and worked four months in the office [[Peter Behrens]], where [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] and [[Walter Gropius]] were also working and learning.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=32â33}}

In 1911, he traveled again for five months; this time he journeyed to the [[Balkans]] and visited [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], as well as [[Pompeii]] and [[Rome]], filling nearly 80 sketchbooks with renderings of what he sawâincluding many sketches of the [[Parthenon]], whose forms he would later praise in his work ''[[Toward an Architecture|Vers une architecture]]'' (1923).  He spoke of what he saw during this trip in many of his books, and it was the subject of his last book, ''Le Voyage d'Orient''.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=32â33}}

In 1912, he began his most ambitious project; a new house for his parents. also located on the forested hillside near La-Chaux-de-Fonds.  The Jeanneret-Perret house was larger than the others, and in a more innovative style; the horizontal planes contrasted dramatically with the steep alpine slopes, and the white walls and lack of decoration were in sharp contrast with the other buildings on the hillside. The interior spaces were organized around the four pillars of the salon in the center, foretelling the open interiors he would create in his later buildings.  The project was more expensive to build than he imagined; his parents were forced to move from the house within ten years, and relocate in a more modest house.  However, it led to a commission to build an even more imposing villa in the nearby village of [[Le Locle]]  for a wealthy watch manufacturer. Georges Favre-Jacot. Le Corbusier designed the new house in less than a month. The building was carefully designed to fit its hillside site, and interior plan was spacious and designed around a courtyard for maximum light, significant departure from the traditional house.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=48â9}}

==Dom-ino House and Schwob House (1914â1918)==
[[File:Charles-Ãdouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier), 1914-15, Maison Dom-Ino.jpg|thumb|left|Charles-Ãdouard Jeanneret, 1914â15, ''[[Dom-ino House|Maison Dom-Ino (Dom-ino House)'']] ]]

During [[World War I]], Le Corbusier taught at his old school in La-Chaux-de-Fonds, He concentrated on theoretical architectural studies using modern techniques.&lt;ref name="Choay"&gt;{{cite book|last=Choay|first=FranÃ§oise|title=Le Corbusier|url=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL8322926W/Le_Corbusier|year=1960|pages=10â11|publisher=George Braziller, Inc.|isbn=0-8076-0104-7|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 1914, along with the engineer Max Dubois, he began a serious study of the use of reinforced concrete as a building material.  He had first discovered concrete working with Auguste Perret in Paris, but now wanted to use it in new ways.

"Reinforced concrete provided me with incredible resources," he wrote later, "and variety, and a passionate plasticity in which by themselves my structures will be rhythm of a palace, and a Pompieen tranquility.".&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Auguste Perret (1915), cited in ''Lettres a ces Maitres'', vol. 1, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  This led him to his plan for the [[Dom-ino House|Dom-Ino House]] (1914â15). This model proposed an open floor plan consisting of three concrete slabs supported by six thin [[reinforced concrete column]]s, with a stairway providing access to each level on one side of the floor plan.&lt;ref name="Tim Benton"&gt;Tim Benton, ''Les Villas de Le Corbusier 1920â1929'', Philippe Sers Ã©d. Paris, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The system was originally designed to provide large numbers of temporary residences after World War I, producing only slabs, columns and stairways, and residents could build exterior wallls with the materials around the site. He described it in his patent application as "a juxtiposable system of construction according to an infinite number of combinations of plans.  This would permit, he wrote, "the construction of the dividing walls at any point on the faÃ§ade or the interior."

[[File:CF05.jpg|thumb|The Anatole Schwob House in La-Chaux-de-Fonds (1916â1918)]]

Under this system, the structure of the house did not have to appear on the outside, but could be hidden behind a glass wall, and the interior could be arranged in any way the architect liked.&lt;ref&gt;cited by Turner, Paul, "La Formation de Le Corbusier", Paris, Macula, 1987, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; After it was patented, Le Corbusier designed a number of houses according to the system, which were all white concrete boxes. Although some of these were never built, they illustrated his basic architectural ideas which will dominate his works throughout the 1920s. He refined the idea in his 1927 book on the ''Five Points of a New Architecture''. This design, which called for the disassociation of the structure from the walls, and the freedom of plans and faÃ§ades, became the foundation for most of his architecture over the next ten years.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=50â51}}

In August 1916, Le Corbusier received his largest commission ever, to construct a villa for the Swiss watchmaker Anatole Schwob, for whom he had already completed several small remodeling projects. He was given a large budget and the freedom to design not only the house, but also to create the interior decoration and choose the furniture.  Following the precepts of Auguste Perret, he built the structure out of reinforced concrete and filled the gaps with brick.The center of the house is a large concrete box with two semicolumn structures on both sides, which reflects his ideas of pure geometrical forms. A large open hall with a chandelier occupied the center of the building.

Le Corbusier's grand ambitions collided with the ideas and budget of his client, and led to bitter conflicts.  Schwob went to court and denied Le Corbusier access to site, or the right to claim to be the architect. Le Corbusier responded, "Whether you like it or not, my presence is inscribed in every corner of your house." Le Corbusier took great pride in the house, and reproduced pictures in several of his books.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=50}}

Le Corbusier moved to Paris definitively in 1917 and began his own architectural practice with his cousin, [[Pierre Jeanneret]] (1896â1967), a partnership that would last until the 1950s, with an interruption in the [[World War II]] years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/personnage/Le_Corbusier/129220|title=EncyclopÃ©die Larousse en ligne â Charles Ãdouard Jeanneret dit Le Corbusier|first=Ãditions|last=Larousse|date=|work=larousse.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Le Corbusier met the [[Cubism|Cubist]] painter [[AmÃ©dÃ©e Ozenfant]], in whom he recognised a kindred spirit. Ozenfant encouraged him to paint, and the two began a period of collaboration. Rejecting Cubism as irrational and "romantic", the pair jointly published their manifesto, ''AprÃ¨s le cubisme'' and established a new artistic movement, [[Purism (arts)|Purism]]. Ozenfant and Le Corbusier began writing for a new journal,  ''{{Ill|L'Esprit nouveau (revue)|fr}}'', and promoted with energy and imagination his ideas of architecture.

In the first issue of the journal, in 1920, Charles-Edouard Jeanneret adopted '''Le Corbusier''' (an altered form of his maternal grandfather's name, LecorbÃ©sier) as a pseudonym, reflecting his belief that anyone could reinvent themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOKNzunERUwC&amp;pg=PA161|title=Le Corbusier: choix de lettres|first1=Le|last1=Corbusier|first2=Jean|last2=Jenger|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondationlecorbusier.asso.fr/repbio_us.htm RepÃ¨res biographiques, Fondation Le Corbusier]. Fondationlecorbusier.asso.fr. Retrieved on 27 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting a single name to identify oneself was in vogue by artists in many fields during that era, especially in Paris.

Between 1918 and 1922, Le Corbusier did not build anything, concentrating his efforts on Purist theory and painting. In 1922, he and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret opened a studio in Paris at 35 rue de SÃ¨vres.&lt;ref name="Choay"/&gt;
His theoretical studies soon advanced into several different single-family house models. Among these was the Maison "Citrohan", a pun on the name of the French [[CitroÃ«n]] automaker, for the modern industrial methods and materials Le Corbusier advocated using for the house. Here, Le Corbusier proposed a three-floor structure, with a double-height living room, bedrooms on the second floor, and a kitchen on the third floor. The roof would be occupied by a sun terrace. On the exterior Le Corbusier installed a stairway to provide second-floor access from ground level. Here, as in other projects from this period, he also designed the faÃ§ades to include large uninterrupted banks of windows. The house used a rectangular plan, with exterior walls that were not filled by windows but left as white, stuccoed spaces. Le Corbusier and Jeanneret left the interior aesthetically spare, with any movable furniture made of tubular metal frames. Light fixtures usually comprised single, bare bulbs. Interior walls also were left white.

==''Toward an Architecture'' (1920â1923)==
In 1922 and 1923, Le Corbusier devoted himself to advocating his new concepts of architecture and urban planning in a series of polemical articles published in ''L'Esprit Nouveau''. At the Paris Salon d'Automne in 1922, he presented his plan for the [[Ville Contemporaine]], a model city for three million people, whose residents would live and work in a group of identical sixty-story tall apartment buildings surrounded by lower zig-zag apartment blocks and a large park. In 1923, he collected his essays from ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' published his first and most influential book, "Towards an Architecture". He presented his ideas for the future of architecture in a series of maxims, declarations, and exhortations. commencing with "A grand epoch has just begun. There exists a new spirit. There already exist a crowd of works in the new spirit, they are found especially in industrial production. Architecture is suffocating in its current uses. "Styles" are a lie. Style is a unity of principles which animates all the work of a period and which result in a characteristic spirit...Our epoch determines each day its style..-Our eyes, unfortunately don't know how to see it yet," and his most famous maxim, "A house is a machine to live in."  Most of the many photographs and drawings in the book came from outside the world of traditional architecture;   the cover showed the promenade deck of an ocean liner, while others showed racing cars, airplanes, factories, and the huge concrete and steel arches of [[zeppelin]] hangars.{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|1923|pages=1â150}}

==L'Esprit Nouveau Pavilion (1925)==
[[File:L'Esprit Nouveau pavilion at the 1925 Paris International Exposition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts.jpg|thumb|The Pavilion of the Esprit Nouveau (1925)]]
[[File:Plan Voisin model.jpg|thumb|The model of the Plan Voisin for the reconstruction of Paris displayed at the Pavilion of the Esprit Nouveau]]

An important early work of Le Corbusier was the Esprit Nouveau Pavilion, built for the 1925 Paris [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]], the event which later gave [[Art Deco]] its name. Le Corbusier built the pavilion in collaboration with [[AmÃ©dÃ©e Ozenfant]] and with his cousin Pierre Jeanneret. Le Corbusier and Ozenfant had broken with [[Cubism]] and formed the [[Purism]] movement in 1918 and in 1920 founded their journal ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' in 1920.  In his new journal, Le Corbusier vividly denounced the decorative arts:  "Decorative Art, as opposed to the machine phenomenon, is the final twitch of the old manual modes, a dying thing."  To illustrate his ideas, he and Ozenfant decided to create small pavilion at the Exposition, representing his idea of the future urban housing unit. A house, he wrote, "is a cell within the body of a city. The cell is made up of the vital elements which are the mechanics of a house...Decorative art is antistandarizational. Our pavilion will contain only standard things created by industry in factories and mass produced, objects truly of the style of today...my pavilion will therefore be a cell extracted from a huge apartment building."{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=46}}

Le Corbusier and his collaborators were given a plot of land located behind the [[Grand Palais]] in the center of the Exposition. The plot was forested, and exhibitors could not cut down trees, so Le Corbusier built his pavilion with a tree in the center, emerging through a hole in the roof. The building was a stark white box with an interior terrace and square glass windows. The interior was decorated with a few cubist paintings and with a few pieces of mass-produced commercially available furniture, entirely different from the expensive, one-of-a-kind pieces in the other pavilions.  The chief organizers of the Exposition were furious, and built a fence to partially hide the pavilion. Le Corbusier had to appeal to the Ministry of Fine Arts, which ordered that fence be taken down.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=46}}

Besides the furniture, the pavilion exhibited a model of his "Plan Voisin"  his provocative plan for rebuilding a large part of the centre of Paris. He proposed to bulldoze a large area north of the Seine and replace the narrow streets, monuments and houses with giant sixty-story cruciform towers placed within an orthogonal street grid and park-like green space. His scheme was met with criticism and scorn from French politicians and industrialists, although they were favorable to the ideas of Taylorism and Fordism underlying his designs. The plan was never seriously considered, but it provoked discussion concerning how to deal with the overcrowded poor working-class neighborhoods of Paris, and it later saw partial realization in the housing developments built in the Paris suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s.

The Pavilion was ridiculed by many critics, but Le Corbusier, undaunted, wrote:  "Right now one thing is sure. 1925 marks the decisive turning point in the quarrel between the old and new. After 1925, the antique-lovers will have virtually ended their lives . . . Progress is achieved through experimentation; the decision will be awarded on the field of battle of the 'new'."{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=49}}

==''The Decorative Art of Today'' (1925)==
In 1925, Le Corbusier combined a series of articles about decorative art from "L'Esprit Nouveau" into a book, ''L'art dÃ©coratif d'aujourd'hui'' (''The Decorative Art of Today'').&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''L'Art dÃ©coratif dâaujourd'hui'', Paris, G. CrÃ¨s, Â« LâEsprit nouveau Â», 1925. RÃ©Ã©dition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.openedition.org/pupo/2422?lang=en Yannis Tsiomis, ''Le Corbusier, LâArt dÃ©coratif dâaujourdâhui et Â« la loi du ripolin Â»''], Presses universitaires de Paris Nanterre, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The book was a spirited attack on the very idea of decorative art.  His basic premise, repeated throughout the book, was: "Modern decorative art has no decoration."&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''L'art dÃ©coratif d'aujourd'hui'', (originally 1925, Flammarion edition of 1996, ISBN+978-2-0812-2062-1.&lt;/ref&gt;  He attacked with enthusiasm the styles presented at the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts:  "The desire to decorate everything about one is a false spirit and an abominable small perversion....The religion of beautiful materials is in its final death agony...The almost hysterical onrush in recent years toward this quasi-orgy of decor is only the last spasm of a death already predictable."{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|page=98}} He cited the 1912 book of the Austrian architect [[Adolf Loos]] "Ornament and crime", and quoted Loos's dictum, "The more a people are cultivated, the more decor disappears."   He attacked the deco revival of classical styles, what he called "Louis Philippe and Louis XVI moderne";  he condemned the "symphony of color" at the Exposition, and called it "the triumph of assemblers of colors and materials. They were swaggering in colors... They were making stews out of fine cuisine."   He condemned the exotic styles presented at the Exposition based on the art of China, Japan, India and Persia.  "It takes energy today to affirm our western styles." He criticized the "precious and useless objects that accumulated on the shelves" in the new style. He attacked the "rustling silks, the marbles which twist and turn, the vermilion whiplashes, the silver blades of Byzantium and the Orientâ¦Let's be done with it!"{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|1925|page=70â81}}

"Why call bottles, chairs, baskets and objects decorative?" Le Corbusier asked. "They are useful toolsâ¦.Decor is not necessary. Art is necessary." He declared that in the future the decorative arts industry would produce only "objects which are perfectly useful, convenient, and have a true luxury which pleases our spirit by their elegance and the purity of their execution, and the efficiency of their services. This rational perfection and precise determinate creates the link sufficient to recognize a style."  He described the future of decoration in these terms:  "The ideal is to go work in the superb office of a modern factory, rectangular and well-lit, painted in white Ripolin (a major French paint manufacturer); where healthy activity and laborious optimism reign." He concluded by repeating "Modern decoration has no decoration".{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|1925|page=70â81}}

The book became a manifesto for those who opposed the more traditional styles of the decorative arts;  In the 1930s, as Le Corbusier predicted, the modernized versions of Louis Philippe and Louis XVI furniture and the brightly colored wallpapers of stylized roses were replaced by a more sober, more streamlined style.  Gradually the modernism and functionality proposed by Le Corbusier overtook the more ornamental style.  The shorthand titles that Le Corbusier used in the book, ''1925 Expo: Arts Deco'' was adapted in 1966 by the art historian [[Bevis Hillier]] for a catalog of an exhibition on the style, and in 1968 in the title of a book, ''[[Art Deco of the 20s and 30s]]''. And thereafter the term "Art Deco" was commonly used as the name of the style.&lt;ref&gt;''Benton, Charlotte, Benton, Tim, Wood, Ghislaine, ''Art DÃ©co dans le monde- 1910â39'', 2010, Renaissance du Livre, {{ISBN|9782507003906}}, pp. 16â17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five Points of Architecture to Villa Savoye (1923â1931)==

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The notoriety that Le Corbusier achieved from his writings and the Pavilion at the 1925 Exposition led to commissions to build a dozen residences in Paris and in the Paris region in his "purist style." These included the [[Maison La Roche|Maison La Roche/Albert Jeanneret]] (1923â1925), which now houses the [[Fondation Le Corbusier]]; the [[Maison Guiette]] in [[Antwerp]], Belgium (1926); a residence for [[Jacques Lipchitz]]; the [[Maison Cook]], and the [[Maison Planeix]].  In 1927, he was invited by the German [[Deutscher Werkbund|Werkbund]] to build three houses in the model city of Weissenhof near [[Stuttgart]], based on the Citrohan House and other theoretical models he had published. He described this project in detail one of his best-known essays, the ''Five Points of Architecture''.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=37}}

The following year he began the [[Villa Savoye]] (1928â1931), which became one of the most famous of Le Corbusier's works, and an icon of modernist architecture. Located in [[Poissy]], in a landscape surrounded by trees and large lawn, the house is an elegant white box poised on rows of slender pylons, surrounded by a horizontal band of windows which fill the structure with light. The service areas (parking, rooms for servants and laundry room)  are located under the house.  Visitors enter a vestibule from which a gentle ramp leads to the house itself.  The bedrooms and salons of the house are distributed around a suspended garden;  the rooms look both out at the landscape and into the garden, which provides additional light and air. Another ramp leads up to the roof, and a stairway leads down to the cellar under the pillars.

Villa Savoye succinctly summed up the five points of architecture that he had elucidated in ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' and the book ''[[Toward an Architecture|Vers une architecture]]'', which he had been developing throughout the 1920s. First, Le Corbusier lifted the bulk of the structure off the ground, supporting it by ''[[piloti]]s'', reinforced concrete stilts. These ''pilotis'', in providing the structural support for the house, allowed him to elucidate his next two points: a free faÃ§ade, meaning non-supporting walls that could be designed as the architect wished, and an [[free plan|open floor plan]], meaning that the floor space was free to be configured into rooms without concern for supporting walls. The second floor of the Villa Savoye includes long strips of ribbon windows that allow unencumbered views of the large surrounding garden, and which constitute the fourth point of his system. The fifth point was the [[roof garden]] to compensate for the green area consumed by the building and replacing it on the roof. A ramp rising from ground level to the third-floor roof terrace allows for an architectural promenade through the structure. The white tubular railing recalls the industrial "ocean-liner" aesthetic that Le Corbusier much admired.

Le Corbusier was quite rhapsodic when describing the house in ''PrÃ©cisions'' in 1930: "the plan is pure, exactly made for the needs of the house. It has its correct place in the rustic landscape of Poissy.  It is Poetry and lyricism, supported by technique."{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=83}}  The house had its problems;  the roof persistently leaked, due to construction faults;  but it became a landmark of modern architecture and one of the best-known works of Le Corbusier.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=83}}

==League of Nations Competition and Pessac Housing Project (1926â1930)==
[[File:Pessac Quartiers Modernes FrugÃ¨s 004.jpg|thumb|Low-cost housing units built by Le Corbusier in the [[Quartiers Modernes FrugÃ¨s]] in [[Pessac]] (1927)]]
Thanks to his passionate articles in L'Esprit Nouveau, his participation in the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition and the conferences he gave on the new spirit of architecture, Le Corbusier had become well known in the architectural world, though he had only built residences for wealthy clients. In 1926, he entered the competition for the construction of a headquarters for the [[League of Nations]] in Geneva with a plan for an innovative lakeside complex of modernist white concrete office buildings and meeting halls. There were three-hundred thirty seven projects in competition.  It appeared that the Corbusier's project was the first choice of the architectural jury, but after much behind-the scenes maneuvering the jury declared it was unable to pick a single winner, and the project was given instead to the top five architects, who were all neoclassicists. Le Corbusier was not discouraged; he presented his own plans to the public in articles and lectures to show the opportunity that the League of Nations had missed.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=116}}

In 1927, Le Corbusier received the opportunity he had been looking for; he was commissioned by a Bordeaux industrialist, Henry FrugÃ¨s a fervent admirer of his ideas on urban planning, to build a complex of worker housing, the [[Quartiers Modernes FrugÃ¨s]], at [[Pessac]], near Bordeaux. Le Corbusier described Pessac as "A little like a Balzac novel", a chance to create a whole community for living and working. The Fruges quarter became his first laboratory for a residential housing;  a series of rectangular blocks composed of modular housing units located in a garden setting. Like the unit displayed at the 1925 Exposition, each housing unit had its own small terrace.  The earlier villas he constructed all had white exterior walls, but for Pessac, at the request of his clients, he added color; panels of brown, yellow and jade green, coordinated by Le Corbusier. Originally planned to have some two hundred units, it finally contained about fifty to seventy housing units, in eight buildings. Pessac became the model on a small scale for his later and much larger CitÃ© Radieuse projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/15/arts/architecture-view-le-corbusier-s-housing-project-flexible-enough-endure-ada.html|title=Architecture View; Le Corbusier's Housing Project-Flexible Enough to Endure; by Ada Louise Huxtable|author=|date=15 March 1981|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding of CIAM (1928) and Athens Charter==
In 1928, Le Corbusier took a major step toward establishing modernist architecture as the dominant European style. Le Corbusier had met with many of the leading German and Austrian modernists during the competition for the League of Nations in 1927. In the same year, the German Werkbund organized an architectural exposition at the [[Weissenhof Estate]] [[Stuttgart]]. Seventeen leading modernist architects in Europe were invited to design twenty-one houses;  Le Corbusier and [[Mies Van der Rohe]] played a major part. In 1927 Le Corbusier, Pierre Chareau and others proposed the foundation of an international conference to establish the basis for a common style.  The first meeting of the ''[[CongrÃ¨s International d'Architecture Moderne|CongrÃ¨s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]]'' or International Congresses of Modern Architects (CIAM), was held in a chÃ¢teau on [[Lake Leman]] in Switzerland 26â28 June 1928. Those attending included Le Corbusier, [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]], [[Auguste Perret]], [[Pierre Chareau]] and [[Tony Garnier (architect)|Tony Garnier]] from France; [[Victor Bourgeois]] from Belgium; [[Walter Gropius]], [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Ernst May]] and [[Mies Van der Rohe]] from Germany; [[Josef Frank (architect)|Josef Frank]]  from Austria; [[Mart Stam]] and [[Gerrit Rietveld]] from the Netherlands, and [[Adolf Loos]] from Czechoslovakia. A delegation of Soviet architects was invited to attend, but they were unable to obtain visas. Later members included [[Josep LluÃ­s Sert]] of Spain and [[Alvar Aalto]] of Finland. No one attended from the United States. A second meeting was organized in 1930 in Brussels by Victor Bourgeois on the topic "Rational methods for groups of habitations".  A third meeting, on "The functional city", was scheduled for Moscow in 1932, but was cancelled at the last minute. Instead the delegates held their meeting on a cruise ship traveling between Marseille and Athens. On board, they together drafted a text on how modern cities should be organized.  The text, called The [[Athens Charter]], after considerable editing by Le Corbusier and others, was finally published in 1943 and became an influential text for city planners in the 1950s and 1960s. The group met once more in Paris in 1937 to discuss public housing and was scheduled to meet in the United States in 1939, but the meeting was cancelled because of the war. The legacy of the CIAM was a roughly common style and doctrine which helped define modern architecture in Europe and the United States after World War II.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=84â85}}

[[File:Centrosoyuz Moscow - Ak Sakharova view.jpg|thumb|Building of the [[Tsentrosoyuz building|Tsentrosoyuz]], headquarters of Soviet trade unions, Moscow (1928â34)]]

Le Corbusier saw the new society founded in the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution as a promising laboratory for his architectural ideas. He met the Russian architect [[Konstantin Melnikov]] during the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition in Paris, and admired the construction of Melnikov's constructvist USSR pavilion, the only other truly modernist building in the Exposition other than his own Esprit Nouveau pavilion. At Melnikov's invitation he traveled to Moscow, where found that his writings had been published in Russian; he gave lectures and interviews, and between 1928 and 1932 he constructed an office building for the [[Tsentrosoyuz building|Tsentrosoyuz]], the headquarters of Soviet trade unions.

In 1932, he was invited to take part in an international competition for the new [[Palace of Soviets]] in Moscow, which was to be built on the site of the Russian Orthodox cathedral of Moscow, demolished by Stalin's orders.  Le Corbusier contributed a highly original plan, a low-level complex of circular and rectangular buildings and a rainbow-like arch from which the roof of the main meeting hall was suspended. To Le Corbusier's distress, his plan was rejected by Stalin in favor of a plan for a massive neoclassical tower, the highest in Europe, crowned with a statue of Vladimir Lenin.  The Palace was never built;  construction was stopped by World War II, a swimming pool took its place;  and after the collapse of the USSR the cathedral was rebuilt on its original site.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=128}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Between 1928 and 1934, as Le Corbusier's reputation grew, he received commissions to construct a wide variety of buildings. In 1928 he received a commission from the Soviet government to construct the headquarters of the Tsentrosoyuz, or central office of trade unions, a large office building whose glass walls alternated with plaques of stone. He built the Villa de Madrot in [[Le Pradet]] (1929â1931); and an apartment in Paris for Charles de Bestigui at the top of an existing building on the [[Champs-ÃlysÃ©es]] 1929â1932, (later demolished). In 1929â1930 he constructed a floating homeless shelter for the Salvation Army on the left bank of the Seine at the [[Pont d'Austerlitz]]. Between 1929 and 1933, he built a larger and more ambitious project for the Salvation Army, the [[CitÃ© de Refuge]], on rue Cantagrel in the 13th arrondissement of Paris.  He also constructed the Swiss Pavilion in the [[CitÃ© Universitaire]] in Paris with 46 units of student housing, (1929â33).  He designed furniture to go with the building;  the main salon was decorated with a montage of black and white photographs of nature.  In 1948, he replaced this with a colorful mural he painted himself. In Geneva he built a glass-walled apartment building with forty-five units, the [[Immeuble ClartÃ©]]. Between 1931 and 1945 he built an apartment building with fifteen units, including an apartment and studio for himself on the 6th and 7th floors, at 4 rue Nungesser-et-Coli in the 16th arrondissement in Paris. overlooking the [[Bois de Boulogne]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=210}}  His apartment and studio are owned today by the Fondation Le Corbusier, and can be visited.

==Ville Contemporaine, Plan Voisin and CitÃ© Radieuse (1922â1939)==
{{See also|UnitÃ© d'habitation|Ville Radieuse}}
As the global [[Great Depression]] enveloped Europe, Le Corbusier devoted more and more time to his ideas for urban design and planned cities. He believed that his new, modern architectural forms would provide an organizational solution that would raise the quality of life for the working classes. In 1922 he had presented his model of the Ville Contemporaine, a city of three million inhabitants, at the Salon d'Automne in Paris.  His plan featured tall office towers with surrounded by lower residential blocks in a park setting. He reported that "analysis leads to such dimensions, to such a new scale, and to such the creation of an urban organism so different from those that exist, that it that the mind can hardly imagine it."{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=98}} The Ville Contemporaine, presenting an imaginary city in an imaginary location, did not attract the attention that Le Corbusier wanted. For his next proposal, the Plan Voisin (1925), he took a much more provocative approach; he proposed to demolish a large part of central Paris and to replace it with a group of sixty-story cruciform office towers surrounded by parkland. This idea shocked most viewers, as it was certainly intended to do.  The plan included a multi-level transportation hub that included depots for buses and trains, as well as highway intersections, and an airport. Le Corbusier had the fanciful notion that commercial airliners would land between the huge skyscrapers. He segregated pedestrian circulation paths from the roadways and created an elaborate road network. Groups of lower-rise zigzag apartment blocks, set back from the street, were interspersed among the office towers. Le Corbusier wrote: "The center of Paris, currently threatened with death, threatened by exodus, is in reality a diamond mine...To abandon the center of Paris to its fate is to desert in face of the enemy." {{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=100}}

As no doubt Le Corbusier expected, no one hurried to implement the Plan Voisin, but he continued working on variations of the idea and recruiting followers. In 1929, he traveled to Brazil where he gave conferences on his architectural ideas. He returned with drawings of his own vision for Rio de Janeiro; he sketched serpentine multi-story apartment buildings on pylons, like inhabited highways, winding through [[Rio Janeiro]].

In 1931, he developed a visionary plan for another city [[Algiers]], then part of France.  This plan, like his Rio Janeiro plan, called for the construction of an elevated viaduct of concrete, carrying residential units, which would run from one end of the city to the other. This plan, unlike his early Plan Voisin, was more conservative, because it did not call for the destruction of the old city of Algiers; the residential housing would be over the top of the old city.  This plan, like his Paris plans, provoked discussion, but never came close to realization.

In 1935, Le Corbusier made his first visit to the United States. He was asked by American journalists what he thought about New York City skyscrapers; he responded, characteristically, that he found them "much too small".&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine, article on Man of the Year, 5 May 1961&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote a book describing his experiences in the States, ''Quand les CathÃ©drales etait blanc-  voyages au pays des timides'' (When Cathedrals were White; voyage to the land of the timid) whose title expressed his view of the lack of boldness in American architecture.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=218}}

He wrote a great deal but built very little in the late 1930s.  The titles of his books expressed the combined urgency and optimism of his messages: ''Cannons? Munitions? No thank you, Lodging please!'' (1938) and ''The lyricism of modern times and urbanism'' (1939).

In 1928, the French Minister of Labour, [[Louis Loucheur]], won the passage of a French law on public housing, calling for the construction of 260,000 new housing units within five years. Le Corbusier immediately began to design a new type of modular housing unit, which he called the Maison Loucheur, which would be suitable for the project.  These units were {{convert|45|m2|spell=in|lk=out|abbr=off}} in size, made with metal frames, and were designed to be mass-produced and then transported to the site, where they would be inserted into frameworks of steel and stone; The government insisted on stone walls to win the support of local building contractors.  The standardisation of apartment buildings was the essence of what Le Corbusier termed the ''Ville Radieuse'' or "radiant city", in a new book which published in 1935. The Radiant City was similar to his earlier Contemporary City and Plan Voisin, with the difference that residences would be assigned by family size, rather than by income and social position. In his 1935 book, he developed his ideas for a new kind of city, where the principle functions; heavy industry, manufacturing, habitation and commerce, would be clearly separated into their own neighbourhoods, carefully planned and designed. However, before any units could be built, World War II intervened.

During the War and the German occupation of France, Le Corbusier did his best to promote his architectural projects.  He moved to [[Vichy]] for a time, where the collaborationist government of Marshal [[Philippe Petain]] was located, offering his services for architectural projects, including his plan for the reconstruction of Algiers, but they were rejected. He continued writing, completing ''Sur les Quatres routes'' (On the Four Routes) in 1941. After 1942, Le Corbusier left Vichy for Paris.{{sfn|Fishman|1982|pages=244â246}}  He became for a time a technical adviser at [[Alexis Carrel]]'s eugenic foundation, he resigned from this position on 20 April 1944.&lt;ref name=Libe&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.liberation.fr/livres/2015/03/18/le-corbusier-plus-facho-que-fada_1223411|title=Le Corbusier plus facho que fada|work=Liberation|date= 18 March 2015|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, he founded a new association of modern architects and builders, the Ascoral, the Assembly of Constructors for a renewal of architecture, but there were no projects to build.{{Sfn|Journet|2015|page=215}}

When the war ended, Le Corbusier was nearly sixty years old, and he had not had a single project realized in ten years. He tried, without success, to obtain commissions for several of the first large reconstruction projects, but his proposals for the reconstruction of the town of [[Saint-DiÃ©]] and for [[La Rochelle]] were rejected. Still, he persisted; Le Corbusier finally found a willing partner in [[Raoul Dautry]], the new Minister of Reconstruction and Urbanism. Dautry agreed to fund one of his projects, a "[[UnitÃ© d'habitation|UnitÃ© d'habitation de grandeur conforme]]", or housing units of standard size, with the first one to be built in [[Marseille]], which had been heavily damaged during the war.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=143}}

This was his first public commission, and was a major breakthrough for Le Corbusier. He gave the building the name of his pre-war theoretical project, the ''CitÃ© Radieuse'', and followed the principles that he had studied before the war, he proposed a giant reinforced concrete framework, into which modular apartments would be fit like bottles into a bottle rack. Like the Villa Savoye, the structure was poised on concrete pylons though, because of the shortage of steel to reinforce the concrete, the pylons were more massive than usual. The building contained 337 duplex apartment modules to house a total of 1,600 people. Each module was three stories high, and contained two apartments, combined so each had two levels (see diagram above). The modules ran from one side of the building to the other, and each apartment had a small terrace at each end. They were ingeniously fitted together like pieces of a Chinese puzzle, with a corridor slotted through the space between the two apartments in each module. Residents had a choice of twenty-three different configurations for the units. Le Corbusier designed furniture, carpets and lamps to go with the building, all purely functional; the only decoration was a choice of interior colors that Le Corbusier gave to residents. The only mildly decorative features of the building were the ventilator shafts on the roof, which Le Corbusier made to look like the smokestacks of an ocean liner, a functional form that he admired.

The building was designed not just to be a residence, but to offer all the services needed for living. Every third floor, between the modules, there was a wide corridor, like an interior street, which ran the length of the building from one end of the building to the other. This served as a sort of commercial street, with shops, eating places, a nursery school and recreational facilities. A running track and small stage for theater performances was located in the roof. The building itself was surrounded by trees and a small park.

Le Corbusier wrote later that the UnitÃ© d'Habitation concept was inspired by the visit he had made to the [[Florence Charterhouse]] at [[Galluzzo]] in Italy, in 1907 and 1910 during his early travels. He wanted to recreate, he wrote, an ideal place "for meditation and contemplation."  He also learned from the monastery, he wrote, that "standardization led to perfection," and that "all of his life a man labours under this impulse: to make the home the temple of the family."{{sfn|Journel|2015|page=139}}

The UnitÃ© d'Habitation marked a turning point in the career of Le Corbusier; in 1952, he was made a Commander of the [[Legion of Honour|LÃ©gion d'Honneur]] in a ceremony held on the roof of his new building. He had progressed from being an outsider and critic of the architectural establishment to its centre, as the most prominent French architect.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=152â158}}

==Postwar Projects, United Nations Headquarters (1947â1952)==
[[File:67Âº PerÃ­odo de Sesiones de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas (8020913157).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Headquarters of the United Nations]] designed by Le Corbusier, [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and [[Wallace K. Harrison]] (1947â52)]]
Le Corbusier made another almost identical UnitÃ© d'Habitation in RezÃ©-les-Nantes in the [[Loire-Atlantique]] Department between 1948 and 1952, and three more over the following years, in [[UnitÃ© d'Habitation of Berlin|Berlin]], Briey-en-ForÃªt and [[Firminy]]; and he designed a factory for the company of Claude and Duval, in Saint-DiÃ© in the [[Vosges]].

In early 1947 Le Corbusier submitted a design for the [[Headquarters of the United Nations]], which was to be built beside the East River in New York. Instead of competition, the design was to be selected by a Board of Design Consultants composed of leading international architects nominated by member governments, including Le Corbusier, [[Oscar Niemeyer]] of Brazil, [[Howard Robertson (architect)|Howard Robertson]] from Britain, Nikolai Bassov of the Soviet Union, and five others from around the world. The committee was under the direction of the American architect [[Wallace K. Harrison]], who was also architect for the Rockefeller family, which had donated the site for the building.

Le Corbusier had submitted his plan for the Secretariat, called Plan 23 of the 58 submitted. In Le Corbusier's plan, where offices, council chambers and General Assembly hall were in teethe a single block in the center of the site.  He lobbied hard for his project, and asked the younger Brazilian architect, Niemeyer, to support and assist him on his plan. Niemeyer, to help Le Corbusier, refused to submit his own design and did not attend the meetings until the Director, Harrison, insisted. Niemeyer then submitted his plan, Plan 32, with the office building and councils and General Assembly in separate buildings. After much discussion, the Committee chose Niemeyer's plan, but suggested that he collaborate with Le Corbusier on the final project. Le Corbusier urged Niemeyer to put the General Assembly Hall in the center of the site, though this would eliminate Niemeyer's plan to have a large plaza in the center. Niemeyer agreed with Le Corbusier's suggestion, and the headquarters was built, with minor modifications, according to their joint plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archives.un.org/content/oscar-niemeyer-and-united-nations-headquarters-1947-1949 |title=Oscar Niemeyer and the United Nations Headquarters (1947â1949) |work=[[United Nations]] |date=December 2014 |accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Le Corbusier was an avowed atheist. but he also had a strong belief in the ability of architecture in to create a sacred and spiritual environment. In the postwar years he designed two important religious buildings; the [[Notre Dame du Haut|Chapelle of Notre-Dame-du-Haut]] at [[Ronchamp]] (1950â1955); and the Convent of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] (1953â1960). Le Corbusier wrote later that he was greatly aided in his religious architecture by a Dominican father, PÃ¨re Couturier, who had founded a movement and review of modern religious art.

Le Corbusier first visited the remote mountain site of Ronchamp in May 1950, saw the ruins of the old chapel, and drew sketches of possible forms. He wrote afterwards: "In building this chapel, I wanted to create a place of silence, of peace, of prayer, of interior joy. The feeling of the sacred animated our effort.  Some things are sacred, others aren't, whether they're religious or not."&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''Ronchamp", Hatje, Stuttgart, (1925), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second major religious project undertaken by Le Corbusier was the Convent of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] in [[L'Arbresle]] in the Rhone Department (1953â1960). Once again it was Father Couturier who engaged Le Corbusier in the project. He invited Le Corbusier to visit the starkly simple and imposing 12thâ13th century [[Le Thoronet Abbey]] in Provence, and also used his memories of his youthful visit to the Erna Charterhouse in Florence. This project involved not only a chapel, but a library, refectory, rooms for meetings and reflection, and dormitories for the nuns.  For the living space he used the same [[Modulor]] concept for measuring the ideal living space that he had used in the UnitÃ© d'Habitation in Marseille; height under the ceiling of {{convert|2.26|m|abbr=off}}; and width {{convert|1.83|m|abbr=off}}.{{Sfn|Jounret|2015|pages=154â55}}

Le Corbusier used raw concrete to construct the convent, which is placed on the side of a hill.  The three blocks of dormitories U, closed by the chapel, with a courtyard in the center. The Convent has a flat roof, and is placed on sculpted concrete pillars. Each of the residential cells has small loggia with a concrete sunscreen looking out at the countryside.  The centerpiece of the convent is the chapel, a plain box of concrete, which he called his "Box of miracles."  Unlike the highly finished faÃ§ade of the UnitÃ© d'Habitation, the faÃ§ade of the chapel is raw, unfinished concrete. He described the building in a letter to [[Albert Camus]] in 1957: "I'm taken with the idea of a "box of miracles"....as the name indicates, it is a rectangual box made of concrete. It doesn't have any of the traditional theatrical tricks, but the possibility, as its name suggests, to make miracles."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Albert Camus, 13 February 1957, FLC (Fondation Le Corbusier), E1-12-154)&lt;/ref&gt; The interior of the chapel is extremely simple, only benches in a plain, unfinished concrete box, with light coming through a single square in the roof and six small band on the sides. The Crypt beneath has intense blue, red and yellow walls, and illumination by sunlight channeled from above.  The monastery has other unusual features, including floor to ceiling panels of glass in the meeting rooms, window panels that fragmented the view into pieces, and a system of concrete and metal tubes like gun barrels which aimed sunlight through colored prisms and projected it onto the walls of sacristy and to the secondary altars of the crypt on the level below. These were whimsically termed the ""machine guns" of the sacristy and the "light cannons" of the crypt.{{Sfn|Journet|2015|pages=184â185}}

In 1960, Le Corbusier began a third religious building, the Church of Saint Pierre in the new town of Firminy-Vert, where he had built a UnitÃ© d'Habitation and a cultural and sports centre. While he made the original design, construction did not begin until five years after his death, and work continued under different architects until it was completed in 2006. The most spectacular feature of the church is the sloping concrete tower that covers the entire interior. similar to that in the Assembly Building in his complex at [[Chandigarh]]. Windows high in the tower illuminate the interior. Le Corbusier originally proposed that tiny windows also project the form of a constellation on the walls. Later architects designed the church to project the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]].{{Sfn|Jounret|2015|page=165}}

==Chandigarh (1951â1956)==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Le Corbusier's largest and most ambitious project was the design of [[Chandigarh]], the capital city of the [[Haryana]] and [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] States of India, created after India received independence in 1947. Le Corbusier was contacted in 1950 by Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], and invited to propose a project. An American architect, [[Albert Mayer (planner)|Albert Mayer]], had made a plan in 1947 for a city of 150,000 inhabitants, but the Indian government wanted a grander and more monumental city. (The city today has a population of more than a million.) Corbusier worked on the plan with two British specialists in urban design and tropical climate architecture, [[Maxwell Fry]] and [[Jane Drew]], and with his cousin, Pierre Jeanneret, who moved to India and supervised the construction until his death.

Le Corbusier, as always, was rhapsodic about his project; "It will be a city of trees," he wrote, "of flowers and water, of houses as simple as those at the time of Homer, and of a few splendid edifices of the highest level of modernism, where the rules of mathematics will reign.".&lt;ref&gt;Letter to his wife Yvonne, 27 February 1951, FLC-R1-12-87. Cited by Journel, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;  His plan called for residential, commercial and industrial areas, along with parks and a transportation infrastructure.  In the middle was the capitol, a complex of four major government buildings; the Palace of the National Assembly, the High Court of Justice; the Palace of Secretariat of Ministers, and the Palace of the Governor. For financial and political reasons, the Palace of the Governor was dropped well into the construction of the city, throwing the final project somewhat off-balance.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}  From the beginning, Le Corbusier worked, as he reported, "Like a forced laborer." He dismissed the earlier American plan as "Faux-Moderne" and overly filled with parking spaces roads. His intent was to present what he had learned in forty years of urban study, and also to show the French government the opportunities they had missed in not choosing him to rebuild French cities after the War.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}} His design made use of many of his favorite ideas; an architectural promenade, incorporating the local landscape and the sunlight and shadows into the design; the use of the [[Modulor]] to give a correct human scale to each element; and his favourite symbol, the open hand; ("the hand is open to give and to receive'.")  He placed a monumental open hand statue in a prominent place in the design.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}

Le Corbusier's design called for the use of raw concrete, whose surface not smoothed or polished and which showed the marks of the forms in which it dried. Pierre Jeanneret wrote to his cousin that he was in a continual battle with the construction workers, who could not resist the urge to smooth and finish the raw concrete, particularly when important visitors were coming to the site. At one point one thousand workers were employed on the site of the High Court of Justice.  Le Corbusier wrote to his mother, "It is an architectural symphony which surpasses all my hopes, which flashes and develops under the light in a way which is unimaginable and unforgettable. From far, from up close, it provokes astonishment; all made with raw concrete and a cement cannon. Adorable, and grandiose. In all the centuries no one has seen that."&lt;ref&gt;letter to his mother, 19 November 1954, FLC-R2-103. Cited by Journlet, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

The High Court of Justice, begun in 1951, was finished in 1956. The building was radical in its design; a parallelogram topped with an inverted parasol.  Along the walls were high concrete grills {{convert|1.5|m|abbr=off}} thick which served as sunshades. The entry featured a monumental ramp and columns that allowed the air to circulate.  The pillars were originally white limestone, but in the 1960s they were repainted in bright colors, which better resisted the weather.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}

The Secretariat, the largest building that housed the government offices, was constructed between 1952 and 1958.  It is an enormous block {{convert|250|m|abbr=off}} long and eight levels high, served by a ramp which extends from the ground to the top level The ramp partly sculptural and partly practical; since there were no modern building cranes, the ramp was the only way to get materials to the top of the construction site. The Secretariat had two features which were borrowed from his design for the UnitÃ© d'Habitation in Marseille; Concrete grill sunscreens over the windows, and a roof terrace.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}

The most important building of the capitol complex was the [[Palace of Assembly (Chandigarh)|Palace of Assembly]] (1952â61), which faced the High Court at the other end of a five hundred meter esplanade, and faces a large reflecting pool. This building features a central courtyard, over which is the main meeting hall for the Assembly.  On the roof on the rear of the building is a signature feature of Le Corbusier, a large tower, similar in form to the smokestack of a ship or the ventilation tower of a heating plant. Le Corbusier added touches of color and texture with an immense tapestry in the meeting hall and large gateway decorated with enamel.  He wrote of this building, "A Palace magnificent in its effect, from the new art of raw concrete. It is magnificent and terrible; terrible meaning that there is nothing cold about it to the eyes."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to his brother Albert, 26 March 1961, FLC-R1-10-586, cited by Journel, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The 1950s and 1960s, were a difficult period for Le Corbusier's personal life;  his wife Yvonne died in 1957, and his mother, to whom he was closely attached, died in 1960. He remained active in a wide variety of fields; in 1955 he published ''PoÃ©me de l'angle droits'', a portfolio of lithographs, published in the same collection as the book ''Jazz'' by [[Henri Matisse]]. In 1958 he collaborated with the composer [[Edgar VarÃ¨se]] on a work called ''Le [[PoÃ¨me Ã©lectronique]]'', a show of sound and light, for the Philips Pavilion at the International Exposition in Brussels. In 1960 he published a new book, ''L'Atelier de la recherchÃ© patiente'' ''The workshop of patient research''), simultaneously published in four languages.  He received growing recognition for his pioneering work in modernist architecture;  in 1959, a successful international campaign was launched to have his Villa Savoye, threatened with demolition, declared an historic monument; it was the first time that a work by a living architect received this distinction.  In 1962, in the same year as the dedication of the Palace of the Assembly in Chandigarh, the first retrospective exhibit on his work was held at the National Museum of Modern Art in Paris. In 1964, in a ceremony held in his atelier on rue de SÃ¨vres, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the LÃ©gion d'honneur by Culture Minister [[AndrÃ© Malraux]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=216}}

His later architectural work was extremely varied, and often based on designs of earlier projects. In 1952â1958, he designed a series of tiny vacation cabins, {{convert|2.26|x|2.26|x|2.6|m|ft|lk=out|abbr=off}} in size, for a site next to the Mediterranean at [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin]]. He built a similar cabin for himself, but the rest of the project was not realized until after his death. In 1953â1957, he designed a residential building for Brazilian students for the CitÃ© de la UniversitÃ© in Paris. Between 1954 and 1959, he built the [[National Museum of Western Art]] in Tokyo. His other projects included a cultural centre and stadium for the town of [[Firminy]], where he had built his first housing project (1955â1958); and a stadium in Baghdad, Iraq (much altered since its construction).  He also constructed three new ''UnitÃ©s d'Habitation'', apartment blocks on the model of the original in Marseille, the first in Berlin (1956â1958), the second in Briey-en-ForÃªt in the [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]] Department; and the third (1959â1967) in Firminy.  In 1960â1963, he built his only building in the United States; the [[Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=216}}

At the time of his death in 1965, several projects were on the drawing boards; the church of Saint-Pierre in Firminy, finally completed in modified form in 2006; a Palace of Congresses for Strasbourg (1962â65), and a hospital in Venice, (1961â1965) which were never built. Le Corbusier designed an art gallery beside the lake in ZÃ¼rich for gallery owner [[Heidi Weber]] in 1962â1967. Now called the [[Centre Le Corbusier]], it is one of his last finished works.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=212}}

==Death==
[[File:Cabanon Le Corbusier.jpg|thumb|The holiday cabin where he spent his last days in [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin]]]]
Against his doctor's orders, on 27 August 1965, Le Corbusier went for a swim in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] at [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin]], France. His body was found by bathers and he was pronounced dead at 11&amp;nbsp;a.m. It was assumed that he may have suffered a heart attack. His funeral took place in the courtyard of the [[Louvre]] Palace on 1 September 1965, under the direction of writer and thinker [[AndrÃ© Malraux]], who was at the time France's [[Minister of Culture]]. He was buried alongside his wife in the grave he had designated at [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]].

Le Corbusier's death had a strong impact on the cultural and political world. Tributes came from around the world, even from some of Le Corbusier's strongest artistic critics. Painter [[Salvador DalÃ­]] recognised his importance and sent a floral tribute. United States President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] said, "His influence was universal and his works are invested with a permanent quality possessed by those of very few artists in our history." The [[Soviet Union]] added, "Modern architecture has lost its greatest master". While his funeral occurred in Paris, Japanese TV channels broadcast [[The National Museum of Western Art|his Museum]] in Tokyo in what was at the time a unique media homage.

His grave is in the cemetery above Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, between Menton and Monaco in southern France.

The Fondation Le Corbusier (FLC) functions as his official estate.&lt;ref name=foundation&gt;{{cite web|title=Foundation: History|url=http://www.fondationlecorbusier.fr/corbuweb/morpheus.aspx?sysId=19&amp;IrisObjectId=7778&amp;sysLanguage=en-en&amp;itemPos=1&amp;sysParentId=19&amp;clearQuery=1|publisher=Fondation Le Corbusier |accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US copyright representative for the Fondation Le Corbusier is the [[Artists Rights Society]].&lt;ref name=rights&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arsny.com/requested.html |title=Our Most Frequently Requested Prominent Artists |publisher=Artists Rights Society |year=2003 |accessdate=18 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131000000/http://arsny.com/requested.html |archivedate=31 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas==
===''The Five Points of a Modern Architecture''===
{{Main article|Le Corbusier's Five Points of Architecture}}
Le Corbusier defined the principles of his new architecture in ''Les cinq points de l'architecture moderne'', published in 1927, and co-authored by his cousin, [[Pierre Jeanneret]].  They summarized the lessons he had learned in the previous years, which he put literally into concrete form in his villas constructed of the late 1920s, most dramatically in the [[Villa Savoye]] (1928â1931)

The five points are:

* the '''Pilotis''', or pylon. The building is raised up on reinforced concrete pylons, which allows for free circulation on the ground level, and eliminates dark and damp parts of the house.
* The '''Roof Terrace'''. The sloping roof is replaced by a flat roof; the roof can be used as a garden, for promenades, sports or a swimming pool.
* The '''Free Plan'''. Load-bearing walls are replaced by a steel or reinforced concrete columns, so the interior can be freely designed, and interior walls can put anywhere, or left out entirely. The structure of the building is not visible from the outside.
* The '''Ribbon Window'''. Since the walls do not support the house, the windows can run the entire length of the house, so all rooms can get equal light.
* The '''Free FaÃ§ade'''. Since the building is supported by columns in the interior, the faÃ§ade can be much lighter and more open, or made entirely of glass. There is no need for lintels or other structure around the windows.

==="Architectural Promenade"===
The "Architectural Promenade" was another idea dear to Le Corbusier, which he particularly put into play in his design of the [[Villa Savoye]]. In 1928, in ''Une Maison, un Palais'', he described it: "Arab architecture gives us a precious lesson: it is best appreciated in walking, on foot. It is in walking, in going from one place to another, that you see develop the features of the architecture. In this house ([[Villa Savoye]]) you find a veritable architectural promenade, offering constantly varying aspects, unexpected, sometimes astonishing." The promenade at Villa Savoye, Le Corbusier wrote, both in the interior of the house and on the roof terrace, often erased the traditional difference between the inside and outside.&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''Une maison â un palais'', G. CrÃ¨s &amp; Cie (1928), pp. 70â78&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ville Radieuse'' and Urbanism===
In the 1930s, Le Corbusier expanded and reformulated his ideas on urbanism, eventually publishing them in ''[[Ville Radieuse|La Ville radieuse]]'' (The Radiant City) in 1935. Perhaps the most significant difference between the Contemporary City and the Radiant City is that the latter abandoned the class-based stratification of the former; housing was now assigned according to family size, not economic position.&lt;ref name=fishman&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Fishman|title=Urban Utopias in the Twentieth Century: Ebenezer Howard, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Le Corbusier|isbn=0262560232 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|year=1982|page=231|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have read dark overtones into ''The Radiant City'': from the "astonishingly beautiful assemblage of buildings" that was Stockholm, for example, Le Corbusier saw only "frightening chaos and saddening monotony." He dreamed of "cleaning and purging" the city, bringing "a calm and powerful architecture"âreferring to steel, plate glass, and reinforced concrete. Although Le Corbusier's designs for Stockholm did not succeed, later architects took his ideas and partly "destroyed" the city with them.&lt;ref name=dalrymple&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dalrymple|first=Theodore|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_4_otbie-le-corbusier.html|title=The Architect as Totalitarian: Le Corbusier's baleful influence|work=City Journal|date=Autumn 2009 |volume=19 |issue=4|accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Corbusier hoped that politically minded industrialists in France would lead the way with their efficient [[Scientific management|Taylorist]] and [[Fordism|Fordist]] strategies adopted from American industrial models to reorganize society. As Norma Evenson has put it, "the proposed city appeared to some an audacious and compelling vision of a brave new world, and to others a frigid megalomaniacally scaled negation of the familiar urban ambient."&lt;ref name=evenson&gt;{{cite book|last=Evenson|first=Norma|title=Le Corbusier: The Machine and the Grand Design|publisher=George Braziller|location=New York|year=1969|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Corbusier "His ideasâhis urban planning and his architectureâare viewed separately," Perelman noted, "whereas they are one and the same thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/new-books-claim-le-corbusier-fascist-289334|title=New Books Claim Le Corbusier Was a Fascist|last=Munro|first=Cait|date=17 April 2005|website=Artnet news|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''La Ville radieuse'', he conceived an essentially apolitical society, in which the bureaucracy of economic administration effectively replaces the state.{{sfn|Fishman|1982|page=228}}

Le Corbusier was heavily indebted to the thought of the 19th-century French utopians [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] and [[Charles Fourier]]. There is a noteworthy resemblance between the concept of the unitÃ© and Fourier's [[phalanstery]].&lt;ref name=serenyi&gt;{{cite journal|first=Peter|last=Serenyi|title=Le Corbusier, Fourier, and the Monastery of Ema|work=The Art Bulletin|volume=49|number=4|date=December 1967|page=282|doi=10.2307/3048487|jstor=3048487}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Fourier, Le Corbusier adopted at least in part his notion of administrative, rather than political, government.

===Modulor===
{{Main article|Modulor}}

The [[Modulor]] was a standard model of the human form which Le Corbusier devised to determine the correct amount of living space needed for residents in his buildings. It was also his rather original way of dealing with differences between the metric system and British or American system, since the Modulor was not attached to either one.

Le Corbusier explicitly used the [[golden ratio]] in his [[Modulor]] system for the [[scale (ratio)|scale]] of [[proportion (architecture)|architectural proportion]]. He saw this system as a continuation of the long tradition of [[Vitruvius]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s "[[Vitruvian Man]]", the work of [[Leon Battista Alberti]], and others who used the proportions of the human body to improve the appearance and function of architecture. In addition to the [[golden ratio]], Le Corbusier based the system on [[anthropometry|human measurements]], [[Fibonacci number]]s, and the double unit. Many scholars see the Modulor as a humanistic expression but it is also argued that: "It's exactly the opposite (...) It's the mathematicization of the body, the standardization of the body, the rationalization of the body."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/arts/design/le-corbusiers-architecture-and-his-politics-are-revisited.html|title=New York Times|last=Donadio|first=Rachel|date=12 July 2015|website=nytimes.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He took Leonardo's suggestion of the golden ratio in human proportions to an extreme: he sectioned his model human body's height at the navel with the two sections in golden ratio, then subdivided those sections in golden ratio at the knees and throat; he used these golden ratio proportions in the [[Modulor]] system.

Le Corbusier's 1927 Villa Stein in [[Garches]] exemplified the Modulor system's application. The villa's rectangular ground plan, elevation, and inner structure closely approximate golden rectangles.&lt;ref name=padovan&gt;{{cite book|last=Padovan|first=Richard|title=Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture|date=2 November 1999|page=320|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0-419-22780-6|quote=from Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor'' p.35: "Both the paintings and the architectural designs make use of the golden section."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Corbusier placed systems of harmony and proportion at the centre of his design philosophy, and his faith in the mathematical order of the universe was closely bound to the golden section and the Fibonacci series, which he described as "rhythms apparent to the eye and clear in their relations with one another. And these rhythms are at the very root of human activities. They resound in Man by an organic inevitability, the same fine inevitability which causes the tracing out of the Golden Section by children, old men, savages, and the learned."{{sfn|padovan|1999|page=316}}

===Open Hand===
[[File:Open Hand Monument in Chandigarh.jpg|thumb|''[[Open Hand Monument]]'' in Chandigarh, India]]

The Open Hand (La Main Ouverte) is a recurring motif in Le Corbusier's architecture, a sign for him of "peace and reconciliation. It is open to give and open to receive." The largest of the many Open Hand sculptures that Le Corbusier created is a 26 meter high version in Chandigarh, India known as ''[[Open Hand Monument]]''.

==Furniture==
{{Main article|Le Corbusier's Furniture}}

Le Corbusier was an eloquent critic of the finely crafted, hand-made furniture, made with rare and exotic woods, inlays and coverings, presented at the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts. Following his usual method, Le Corbusier first wrote a book with his theories of furniture, complete with memorable slogans.  In his 1925 book ''L'Art DÃ©coratif d'aujourd'hui'', he called for furniture that used inexpensive materials and could be mass-produced. Le Corbusier described three different furniture types: ''type-needs'', ''type-furniture'', and ''human-limb objects''. He defined human-limb objects as: "Extensions of our limbs and adapted to human functions that are type-needs and type-functions, therefore type-objects and type-furniture. The human-limb object is a docile servant. A good servant is discreet and self-effacing in order to leave his master free. Certainly, works of art are tools, beautiful tools. And long live the good taste manifested by choice, subtlety, proportion, and harmony".  He further declared, "Chairs are architecture, sofas are [[bourgeois]]",
[[File:LC4 Chair by Le Corbusier and Perriand 1927-28.jpg|thumb|Frame of an LC4 chair by Le Corbusier and Perriand (1927â28) at Museum of Decorative Arts, Paris]]
Le Corbusier first relied on ready-made furniture from Thonet to furnish his projects, such as his pavilion at the 1925 Exposition.  In 1928, following the publication of his theories, he began experimenting with furniture design.  In 1928, he inviting the architect [[Charlotte Perriand]], to join his studio as a furniture designer. His cousin, [[Pierre Jeanneret]], also collaborated on many of the designs. For the manufacture of his furniture, he turned to the German firm [[GebrÃ¼der Thonet]] had begun making chairs with tubular steel, a material originally used for bicycles, in the early 1920s. Le Corbusier admired the design of [[Marcel Breuer]] and the [[Bauhaus]], who in 1925, had begun making sleek modern tubular club chairs. [[Mies van der Rohe]] had begun making his own version in a sculptural curved form with a cane seat in 1927.{{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=382}}

The first results of the collaboration between Le Corbusier and Perriand were three types of chairs made with chrome-plated tubular steel frames; The [[Chaise Longue (Le Corbusier)|LC4]], Chaise Longue, (1927â28), with a covering of cowhide, which gave it a touch of exoticism; the ''Fauteuil Grand Confort'' (LC3) (1928â29), a club chair with a tubular frame which resembled the comfortable Art Deco club chairs that became popular in the 1920s; and the ''Fauteuil Ã  dossier basculant'' (LC4) (1928â29), a low seat suspended in a tubular steel frame, also with a cowhide upholstery. These chairs were designed specifically for two of his projects, the ''Maison la Roche'' in Paris and a pavilion for Barbara and Henry Church. All three clearly showed the influence of Mies van der Rohe and Marcel Breuer. The line of furniture was expanded with additional designs for Le Corbusier's 1929 ''[[Salon d'Automne]]'' installation, 'Equipment for the Home'. Despite the intention of Le Corbusier that his furniture should be inexpensive and mass-produced his pieces were originally costly to make and were not mass-produced until many years later, when he was famous. {{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=383}}

==Politics==
The political views of Le Corbusier were rather vague and variable over time. In the 1920s, he briefly wrote articles about urbanism for the [[syndicalist]] journals ''Plans'', ''PrÃ©lude'' and ''L'homme reel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brott|first=Simone|date=2013|title=In the Shadow of the Enlightenment Le Corbusier, Le Faisceau and Georges Valois|journal=Proceedings of the Society of Architectural Historians, Australia and New Zealand|volume=2|issue=30|pages=777â789|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/63644/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1925 and 1928, Le Corbusier had connections to [[Le Faisceau]], a short-lived French fascist party led by [[Georges Valois]]. Valois later became an anti-fascist.&lt;ref&gt;After becoming a wartime [[french resistance|resistance]] fighter, Georges Valois was arrested and died in a Nazi concentration camp.&lt;/ref&gt;  Le Corbusier knew another former member of Faisceau, [[Hubert Lagardelle]], a former labor leader and [[syndicalist]] who had become disaffected with the political left. In 1934, after Lagardelle had obtained a position at the French embassy in Rome, he arranged for Le Corbusier to lecture on architecture in Italy. Lagardelle later served as minister of labor in the pro-Axis [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime. While Le Corbusier sought commissions from the Vichy regime, he was unsuccessful, and the only appointment he received from it was membership of a committee studying urbanism.

Le Corbusier has been accused of anti-semitism. He wrote to his mother in October 1940, prior to a referendum held by the Vichy government: "The Jews are having a bad time. I occasionally feel sorry. But it appears their blind lust for money has rotted the country". He was also accused of belittling the Muslim population of Algeria, then part of France. When Le Corbusier proposed a plan for the rebuilding of Algiers, he condemned the existing housing for European Algerians, complaining that it was inferior to that inhabited by indigenous Algerians: "the civilized live like rats in holes", while "the barbarians live in solitude, in well-being."&lt;ref name=celik&gt;{{cite book|last=Celik|first=Zeynep|title=Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers under French Rule|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|date=28 July 1997|page=4|isbn=978-0520204577|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His plan for rebuilding Algiers was rejected, and thereafter Le Corbusier mostly avoided politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Antliff|first=Mark |title=Avant-Garde Fascism: The Mobilization of Myth, Art, and Culture in France, 1909â1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ADTdniFtnuwC|year=2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-9047-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Few other 20th-century architects were praised, or criticized, as much as Le Corbusier. In his eulogy to Le Corbusier at the memorial ceremony for the architect in the courtyard of the Louvre on 1 September 1965, French Culture Minister [[AndrÃ© Malraux]] declared, "Le Corbusier had some great rivals, but none of them had the same significance in the revolution of architecture, because none bore insults so patiently and for so long."&lt;ref&gt;AndrÃ© Malraux, funeral oration for Le Corbusier, 1 September 1965, cited in Journal (2015), p. 3.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Later criticism of Le Corbusier was directed at his ideas of urban planning.  In 1998 the architectural historian Witold Rybczynski wrote in ''Time'' magazine: &lt;blockquote&gt; "He called it the Ville Radieuse, the Radiant City.  Despite the poetic title, his urban vision was authoritarian, inflexible and simplistic.  Wherever it was tried- in Chandigarh by Le Corbusier himself or in Brasilia by his followers- it failed. Standardization proved inhuman and disorienting. The open spaces were inhospitable; the bureaucratically imposed plan, socially destructive. In the US, the Radiant City took the form of vast urban-renewal schemes and regimented public housing projects that damaged the urban fabric beyond repair. Today, these megaprojects are being dismantled, as superblocks give way to rows of houses fronting streets and sidewalks. Downtowns have discovered that combining, not separating, different activities is the key to success. So is the presence of lively residential neighborhoods, old as well as new. Cities have learned that preserving history makes more sense than starting from zero. It has been an expensive lesson, and not one that Le Corbusier intended, but it too is part of his legacy."&lt;ref&gt;Rybcznski, Witold, ''Time'' magazine, 8 June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[:Category:Historians of technology|Technological historian]] and architecture critic [[Lewis Mumford]] wrote in ''Yesterday's City of Tomorrow'' that the extravagant heights of Le Corbusier's skyscrapers had no reason for existence apart from the fact that they had become technological possibilities. The open spaces in his central areas had no reason for existence either, Mumford wrote, since on the scale he imagined there was no motive during the business day for pedestrian circulation in the office quarter. By "mating utilitarian and financial image of the skyscraper city to the romantic image of the organic environment, Le Corbusier had, in fact, produced a sterile hybrid."

The public housing projects influenced by his ideas have  been criticized for isolating poor communities in monolithic high-rises and breaking the social ties integral to a community's development. One of his most influential detractors has been [[Jane Jacobs]], who delivered a scathing critique of Le Corbusier's urban design theories in her seminal work ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]''.

For some critics, the urbanism of Le Corbusier's was the model for a fascist state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Le Corbusier was concerned by problems he saw in industrial cities at the turn of the 20th century. He thought that industrial housing techniques led to crowding, dirtiness, and a lack of a moral landscape. He was a leader of the modernist movement to create better living conditions and a better society through housing. [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s ''Garden Cities of Tomorrow'' heavily influenced Le Corbusier and his contemporaries.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Le Corbusier revolutionized [[urban planning]], and was a founding member of the [[CongrÃ¨s International d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM).  One of the first to realize how the [[automobile]] would change human society, Le Corbusier conceived the city of the future with large apartment buildings isolated in a park-like setting on [[piloti]]s. Le Corbusier's plans were adopted by builders of public housing in Europe and the United States. In Great Britain urban planners turned to Le Corbusier's "Cities in the Sky" as a cheaper method of building public housing from the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pash-living.co.uk/blog/contemporary-designers/le-corbusier-enfant-terrible-of-modernist-architecture.html|title=Le Corbusier â enfant terrible of Modernist Architecture? / Pash Living Blog|author=|date=|work=pash-living.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Corbusier criticized any effort at ornamentation of the buildings. The large spartan structures in cities, but not 'of' cities, have been criticized for being boring and unfriendly to pedestrians.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Several of the many architects who worked for Le Corbusier in his studio became prominent, including painter-architect [[Nadir Afonso]], who absorbed Le Corbusier's ideas into his own aesthetics theory. [[LÃºcio Costa]]'s [[urban planning|city plan]] of [[BrasÃ­lia]] and the industrial city of [[ZlÃ­n]] planned by [[FrantiÅ¡ek Lydie Gahura]] in the Czech Republic are based on his ideas.  Le Corbusier's thinking had profound effects on city planning and architecture in the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivist]] era.

Le Corbusier harmonized and lent credence to the idea of space as a set of destinations between which mankind moved continuously.  He gave credibility to the automobile as transporter, and to freeways in urban spaces. His philosophies were useful to urban real estate developers in the American post-World War II period because they justified and lent intellectual support to the desire to raze traditional urban space for high density, high profit urban concentration. The freeways connected this new urbanism to low density, low cost, highly profitable suburban locales available to be developed for middle class single-family housing.

Missing from this scheme of movement was connectivity between isolated urban villages created for lower-middle and working classes, and the destination points in Le Corbusier's plan: suburban and rural areas, and urban commercial centers. The freeways as designed traveled over, at, or beneath grade levels of the living spaces of the urban poor, for example the [[CabriniâGreen]] housing project in Chicago. Such projects with no freeway exit ramps, cut off by freeway rights-of-way, became isolated from jobs and services concentrated at Le Corbusier's nodal transportation end points. As jobs migrated to the suburbs, urban village dwellers found themselves without freeway access points in their communities or public mass transit that could economically reach suburban job centers. Late in the post-War period, suburban job centers found labor shortages to be such a critical problem that they sponsored urban-to-suburban shuttle bus services to fill vacant working class and lower-middle class jobs, which did not typically pay enough to afford car ownership.
&lt;!--NOTE: highly editorialized presentation ("prophet who could do no wrong", "incompetence", "Machiavellian", "absurd") -- use neutral tone and include citations or quotes if appropriate.. Le Corbusier deliberately created a myth about himself and was revered in his lifetime, and after death, by a generation of followers who believed Le Corbusier was a prophet who could do no wrong. But in the 1950s the first doubts began to appear, notably in some essays by his greatest admirers such as [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] and [[Colin Rowe]], who denounced as catastrophic his ideas on the city. Later critics revealed his technical incompetence as an architect. In his book ''ArmÃ©e du Salut'', Brian Brace Taylor went into great detail about Le Corbusier's Machiavellian activities to create this commission for himself, his many ill-judged design decisions about building technologies, and the sometimes absurd solutions he then proposed. --&gt;
&lt;!--NOTE: We cannot say "more recently" -- that's [[WP:DATED]]. We cannot says "there has been much discussion" -- we have to say WHO discussed this and GIVE A CITATION.   More recently still there has been much discussion about Le Corbusier's right-wing politics, and his open flirtation with Fascism in the 1930s, when he tried to persuade Benito Mussolini to commission him to design a new capital city for Ethiopia after Mussolini invaded Ethiopia in 1935 using nerve-gas, in breach of League of Nations rules.--&gt;

Le Corbusier influenced architects and urbanists worldwide. In the United States, [[Shadrach Woods]]; in Spain, [[Francisco Javier SÃ¡enz de Oiza]]; in Brazil, [[Oscar Niemeyer]]; In [[Mexico]], [[Mario Pani Darqui]]; in [[Chile]], [[Roberto Matta]]; in [[Argentina]], [[Antoni Bonet i Castellana]] (a Catalan exile), Juan Kurchan, Jorge Ferrari Hardoy, [[Amancio Williams]], and [[Clorindo Testa]] in his first era; in [[Uruguay]], the professors Justino Serralta and Carlos GÃ³mez Gavazzo; in [[Colombia]], GermÃ¡n Samper Gnecco, [[Rogelio Salmona]], and Dicken Castro; in [[Peru]], Abel Hurtado and JosÃ© Carlos Ortecho.

==Fondation Le Corbusier==
[[File:Le Corbusier (Charles-Ãdouard Jeanneret), reproduced in Å½ivot 2 (1922).jpg|thumb|Le Corbusier, work reproduced in Å½ivot 2 (1922)]]
The [[Fondation Le Corbusier]] is a private foundation and archive honoring the work of Le Corbusier. It operates Maison La Roche, a museum located in the [[16th arrondissement of Paris|16th arrondissement]] at 8â10, square du Dr Blanche, Paris, France, which is open daily except Sunday.

The foundation was established in 1968. It now owns Maison La Roche and Maison Jeanneret (which form the foundation's headquarters), as well as the apartment occupied by Le Corbusier from 1933 to 1965 at rue Nungesser et Coli in Paris 16e, and the "Small House" he built for his parents in [[Corseaux]] on the shores of [[Lac Leman]] (1924).

Maison La Roche and Maison Jeanneret (1923â24), also known as the La Roche-Jeanneret house, is a pair of semi-detached houses that was Le Corbusier's third commission in Paris. They are laid out at right angles to each other, with iron, concrete, and blank, white faÃ§ades setting off a curved two-story gallery space. Maison La Roche is now a museum containing about 8,000 original drawings, studies and plans by Le Corbusier (in collaboration with [[Pierre Jeanneret]] from 1922 to 1940), as well as about 450 of his paintings, about 30 enamels, about 200 other works on paper, and a sizable collection of written and photographic archives. It describes itself as the world's largest collection of Le Corbusier drawings, studies, and plans.&lt;ref name=foundation/&gt;&lt;ref name=parisinfo&gt;{{cite web|title=MusÃ©e: Fondation Le Corbusier â Maison La Roche|url=http://en.parisinfo.com/paris-museum-monument/71409/Fondation-Le-Corbusier-Maison-La-Roche|publisher=Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau|accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leadership analysis''' is the art of breaking down a leader into basic [[Psychology|psychological]] components for study and use by academics and practitioners. Good leadership analyses are not reductionist, but rather take into consideration the overall person in the context of the times, society, and culture from which they come. Leadership analysis is traditionally housed in [[political psychology]] departments and utilizes the tools of psychology to achieve political ends by exploiting the psyche in the case of practitioners, or to gain knowledge about the building blocks of leadership and individuals in the case of academics.&lt;ref name=USIC&gt;{{cite book|last=Richelson|first=Jeffrey T.|title=The US Intelligence Community|year=2012|publisher=Westview Press|location=United States|isbn=9780813345116|page=390}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The distinction between the two is not made frivolously; in fact, while academics and practitioners both engage in the overarching act of analyzing leaders, they go about it quite differently. Applied analysts make great use of the psychobiography, while academics tend to analyze transcriptions in search of [[trait theory|traits]] and character clues.&lt;ref name=Post&gt;{{cite book|last=Post|first=Jerrold|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|isbn=0472068385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applied analysis ==

In keeping with the goals of psychology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halonen|first=Jane|title=APA GUIDELINES FOR  THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR|url=http://www.apa.org/ed/precollege/about/psymajor-guidelines.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (describe, explain, predict, control), a psychobiography is first a description of an individualâs life, an explanation or analysis in psychological terms of how the events shaped the individual, and an if/then predictor (if conducting an applied analysis) of the actions the individual might take if given the right situation, leaving the control/change up to the policy-maker requesting the analysis. An if/then predictor is used because no analyst will be able to know the environment that acts upon the individual to the extent of proper analysis. One of the most influential government analysts is [[Jerrold Post]], founder of [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIAâs]] [[Center for the Analysis of Personality and Political Behavior]]. Post's analytical paradigm is below. His background, like many of the earliest applied analysts, was in psychiatry, which utilizes qualitative methods for analysis.

Important theorists for a [[psychobiography]] would be [[Gordon Allport]], [[Alfred Adler]], [[Erik Erikson]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Albert Bandura]], [[John Bowlby]], among others.

These methods focus primarily [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]], [[personality]], and [[developmental psychology|developmental]] theories including the influence of role models, early experiences, heroes and mentors, as well as ego defenses (known more commonly as [[defence mechanisms]]), personality types, belief systems, information processing styles, and cognitive factors. The important thing to note about leadership analysis is the consistency of the individualâs belief systems, rather than small fluctuations.

[[Personality type]]s (and [[personality disorder]]s) play a large part in aiding with analysis, as they are often associated with specific cognitive beliefs and processes. For example, extreme narcissists lack [[empathy]], conscience, and will do anything to accomplish personal goals. Lack of accomplishment is usually taken extremely badly and narcissists have low self-esteem. Narcissists have trouble learning from others because they know everything. Leaders who are narcissists make their people give great shows affirming their righteous leadership, demand praise from others, and employ âyes menâ, or sycophants.

Other common personality types of leaders are obsessive-compulsive, which makes for a hardworking leader with great organizational skills, but also one afraid to make decisions for fear of making a mistake, excessively contentious, and lacking in social grace, and the paranoid; a hypersensitive, easily slighted leader who see the world as full of enemies and will rarely negotiate. [[Paranoia|Paranoid]] leaders fall prey to projecting their beliefs (ego defense) on those around them and are therefore largely autonomous and independent. Their enemies are always coordinated and rational actors intent on the paranoidâs destruction.

In line with developmental psychology, life stages are a particularly important part of analysis, especially during the mid-thirties (when most leaders of coups emerge), or in old age, when leaders, especially narcissists, feel the reins of power slipping and either try to consolidate power, as did [[Deng Xiaoping]], or give it up, as did [[Charles de Gaulle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Post|first=Jerrold|title=Leaders and their Followers in a Dangerous World: the Psychology of Political Behavior|year=2004|publisher=Cornell University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic analysis ==
In contrast to applied analysts, academic analysts generally come from the fields of social psychology and political science and take a quantitative methodology when conducting analysis, usually consisting in part of [[trait theory]] (openness, contentiousness, extroversion, etc.) and/or character study (central to individualâs functioning, observable, stable patterns of behavior, present across circumstances). In addition, quantitative measures such as verbal styles, grammatical choices, and scales for achievement, affiliation, and power provide room for analysis.

=== Verbal categories ===
Sources that are analyzed for verbal styles are general public data that has been cross-checked, legitimized, and filtered for representation of the individual as much as possible. Verbal style is preferred to be off the cuff, both to ensure lack of third party input and to put the individual in what is deemed a stressful situation.

Verbal categories include [[qualifier]]s (âI believeâ), retractors (âbutâ, âneverthelessâ), I/We, me, [[Affirmative and negative|negatives]] (ânothingâ, âneverâ, ânotâ), explainers (âbecauseâ âthereforeâ), feeling expressions (âI likeâ),  direct references (âyour questionâ), nonpersonal references (âJack Kennedy was a friend of mineâ), and expressions. The scores are based on occurrences/1000 words.

These scores can tell about the traits of the individual. Many qualifiers suggest a lack of decisiveness, use of retractors indicate an individual who will reconsider, use of retractors and negatives indicates a large amount of impulsivity, a combination of using I, me, explainers, negatives, and qualifiers, suggest anxiousness (and a less likely change of being the leader of a country), moodiness is identified by high I/we ratio, direct references, expression of feelings, and adverbial intensifiers. Other traits include an angry disposition, evidenced by high negatives, rhetorical questions, and direct references. Impulsive speakers use negatives more than any other group, controlling speakers use low qualifiers, steer the conversation, and use very few feelings. Histrionic individuals use adverbial intensifiers and exaggeration. Passivity is categorized by the extensive use of me. Domineering individuals use lots of qualifiers, retractors, and explainers as well as interruptions. Familiar behavior (establish report) is not surprising evidenced by the use of first names and high direct references. A resilient speaker will lose their verbal style during a crisis and then afterward resume it.&lt;ref name=Weintraub&gt;{{cite book|last=Weintraub|first=Walter|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motivation assessments ===
Leadership analyses can also come in the form of [[motivation]] assessments, where achievement, affiliation, and power are deemed the three fundamental dimensions. Achievement motivation, the concern for excellence, is often manifested in the leader claiming to do âgoodâ or âbetterâ. High achievers delay gratification, have high but achievable expectations, and are innovative. These leaders are rational calculators pursuing self-interest. Affiliation motivation, the concern for close relations with others, is manifested by statements of togetherness and common pursuits. Affiliation leaders form ideological circles and rely on friends, rather than experts, when formulating decisions. They work harder with people who share their ideologies and are aggressive towards people who are different or new. Affiliate leaders will rebel against those they believe are being exploitive, and perceptions of friends and enemies is important. They may appear erratic and unstable and are not adept and working with or managing people they donât know or like. Power motivation portrays the leader and the leaderâs group as the mover and shaker of events. Power motives with a sense of self-control, responsibility, and altruism leads to successful managers who create high-morale atmospheres, are visible and well-known (and liked). Power motives without self-censorship are prone to fall victim to ingratiation and flattery and will take extreme risks with little thought to moral considerations. Unchecked power motives create impulsive behavior and combined with stress, leads to lower immune functions, vulnerability to cardiovascular problems, and infectious diseases.

Studies have shown that countries heading to war will increase power language while decreasing affiliation language. Country documents with high achievement scores generally have stronger economies with greater numbers of entrepreneurs and higher levels of economic development.&lt;ref name=Winter&gt;{{cite book|last=Winter|first=David G|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trait assessment ===
Seven other traits are used for assessing leadership style. The belief that one can influence or control what happens ([[locus of control]]), the need for power and influence, conceptual complexity (ability to differentiate between people and things in an environment), self-confidence, and motivations (problem solving/relationships), general distrust or suspicion, in-group bias. Scoring is done per mention per speech and compared with other leaders being studied. When the first trait, belief in influence, is scored high, these leaders generally get their way and have a way forward. Low scores indicate a belief in constraints, but also in consensus building and compromise. High scores in this trait but low in power motivation will not be able to manipulate as well and will not achieve all they want to do.

=== Conceptual complexity ===
Conceptual complexity and levels of self-confidence make up a self-other orientation, which analyses the level of openness the individual is to input from others. Higher complexity than self-confidence mean more likely to take input, showing a concern for others and are successful at seeing the whole picture and dealing with situations on a case-by-case basis. The reverse situation (higher self-confidence) shows a leader who view the world as they wish to perceive it and use coercion to ensure their views become their followerâs views. Low in both is an individual who mirrors the group that elected them and tends to exhibit narcissistic tendencies.

Self-confidence scores are judged on the use of the words, I, me, myself, and mine. Scores are calculated by average percentage over the course of several speeches. Again, high self-confidence forms a filter with which the individual creates their world-view, low self-confidence turns the individual into a mouth for a cause. Contextual complexity (degree of differentiation) forecasts leaders either seeing multiple paths through situations  (high) or absolutist terms (low).

=== Motivation assessment ===
The continuum of motivations spans from relationships (group maintenance) to problem solving. Coding is done through word choice, where words like accomplish(ment), achieve(ment), plan, position, proposal, recommend(ation),  and tactic signify problem solving and words like appreciation, amnesty, collaboration, disappoint(ment), forgive(ness), harm, liberation, and suffering indicate group maintenance. Scoring is done of one in proportion to the other.

Problem solvers view people as tools to solve problems, sacrificing unity, morale, and cohesion if necessary. Relationship builders will move only if morale is high and the group wants to go in that way.

General distrust and suspicion and in-group bias come from leaderâs distrustful of the âotherâ and believe in the exceptionalism of their people/state. Cues of this trait include words and phrases like great, peace-loving, progressive, successful, prosperous, powerful, capable, made great advances, has boundless resources, firmly defend borders, decide our own fate. Scoring is based on average of percentages across transcripts. Distrust is coded with words like doubtful, uneasy about, misgivings (of the out-group). High leaders in this category see the us-them paradigm and the leader becomes the group (we). The world is a zero-sum game and there may be external enemies constantly needing confrontation.

The directed psychobiography in this case would only include categories of topics discussed in speeches, audience, events and tenure, and any significance in changes of speech patterns/traits.&lt;ref name=Hermann&gt;{{cite book|last=Hermann|first=Margaret G.|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operational coding ===
Another way to conduct a leadership analysis is through operational coding. Operational coding analysis is the study of political leaders that closely focus on set of political beliefs and their cultural context. There are ten questions that should be answered:

Philosophy
#What is the âessentialâ nature of political life? Is the political universe essentially one of harmony or conflict? What is the fundamental character of oneâs political opponents?
#What are the prospects for the eventual realization of oneâs fundamental values and aspirations? Can one be optimistic, or must one be pessimistic on this score; and in what respects the one and/or the other?
#Is the political future predictable? In what sense and to what extent?
#How much âcontrolâ or âmasteryâ can one have over historical development? What is oneâs role in âmovingâ and âshapingâ history in the desired direction?
#What is the role of âchanceâ in human affairs and in historical development?

Instrumental
#What is the best approach for selecting goals or objectives for political action?
#How are the goals of action pursued most effectively?
#How are the risks of political action calculated, controlled, and accepted?
#What is the best âtimingâ of action to advance oneâs interests?
#What are the utility and role of different means for advancing oneâs interests?

Answering these questions will give the nature of the belief system, which can then be categorized into six types (A-F) regarding the opinions of the nature of conflict. A, B, and C believe that conflict is temporary, caused by individual misperceptions (A), pathological societal institutions (B), or anarchical organizations of the international system (C). D, E, and F believe that conflict is permanent, caused by the individual (D), society (E), or the international system (F). Type Aâs motivation is affiliation, which DEF are power motives. B and C shared achievement, but differed in power (B) and affiliation (C).

A system of analysis of operational coding is the psycholinguistic VICS (Verbs in Context System), a system for reviewing belief patterns in speeches in public statements and making inferences about behavior from those beliefs. Subject, verb category, domain of politics, tense of verb, intended target, and context are all scored with + or â points according to the table:

#	Identify the subject: Self or Other
#	Identify the tense of the transitive verb: past, present, future
:a.	Identify the category of the verb +/-
#	Words
:a.	Appeal, support (+1)		Oppose, resist (-1)
:b.	Promise benefits (+2)	Threaten costs (-2)
#	Deeds
:a.	Rewards (+3)			Punishments (-3)
#	Identify domain: Domestic or Foreign
#	Identify target and place in context

Scoring (after weighting based on same verb categories and multiplying by frequency measures)- these can be applied to any of the operational coding questions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker, Schafer, and Young|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Adolf Hitler ===
[[Adolf Hitler]] was one of the first targets of government analysis by the [[Office of Strategic Services]] on at least two occasions, one being by Dr. [[Henry Murray]] titled "[[Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler]]", another by [[Walter Charles Langer|Walter Langer]] titled [[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]], and another of unknown origin titled "Adolf Hitler". These psychobiographies included headers such as background, education, physique, religion, metamorphosis in Landsberg, sexual life, speechmaking technique, Hitler as he believes himself to be, Hitler as the German people know him, Hitler as his associates know him, Hitler as he knows himself, Hitler the man, and Predictions of Hitler's behavior in the coming future. These analyses included observations such as Hitler's messiah complex, sense of destiny, and how his rough beginnings inspired him to be where he is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Henry|title=Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler: With Predictions of His Future Behavior and Suggestions for Dealing with Him Now and After Germany's Surrender|url=http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/library/WhatWeHave/SpecialCollections/Donovan/Hitler/Download.cfm|work=Cornell University Law Library|publisher=Cornell University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Woodrow Wilson ===
[[Woodrow Wilson]] was another target of analysis by psychobiographers George and George, who concluded a self-defeating pattern of low self-esteem and inner doubt that originated from his father, a Presbyterian Preacher whose perfectionist demands his son internalized. A competing analysis by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] maintained that Wilson had not resolved the [[Oedipus complex]] and identified with his father and his harsh [[superego]]. His repressed aggression was reflected on those around him, who were his "younger brothers".

=== Camp David Profiles ===
Post's creation of the Center for the Analysis of Personality and Behavior (CAPB) (later the Political Psychology Division) at [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] lead to the creation of the Camp David Profiles, psychobiographies of [[Anwar Sadat]] and [[Menachem Begin]] as well as how to manipulate each to get the best negotiation position. These were extensively studied by Carter, and resulted in the Nobel Prize. Among the findings where Anwar Sadat's "Nobel Prize Complex", his desire to be forever known in history as a great leader and Begin's biblical preoccupation and fixation on detail, which Carter was able to play off each other.

=== Carter ===
From an academic perspective, Carter's VICS score changed intensely from before to after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Carter had previously been cooperative and friendly but changed to hostile and conflict prone afterward.

=== Bill Clinton ===
Bill Clinton's Trait and Motivation Profile, gathered from Q&amp;A at press conferences, presented [[Bill Clinton]] as a single successful politician, rather than a part of a larger whole or cause (use of "I" was highest of post-World War II presidents while "we" was lowest), the use of qualifiers and retractors, presented a confident individual with no desire to control the flow of conversation but who would make decisions and rethink them when necessary. He doesn't use many explainers and tells, rather than explains his views. He is the most expressive post-World War II president and with high adverbial intensifiers, he is an actor who displays histrionic ([[attention seeking]]) behavior. His high negatives score shows he's very defensive when attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weintraub|first=Walter|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan|location=Michigan|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Saddam Hussein ===
An analysis of [[Saddam Hussein]] reveals a rational calculator who when necessary, finds it prudent to change mind and adapt other tactics, as long as he can find a face-saving measure to do so. His childhood started with his mother rejecting physically rejecting room, being saved by a [[Jews|Jewish]] family, and then sent off to live with his uncle in order to get an education. His uncle indoctrinated him in the ways of Iraqi nationalism and the Baath party. His early hero was Abdel Nasser of [[Egypt]], who confronted the West and gained his Arab nationalist credentials. Saddam was part of an attempted Iraqi uprising, which failed and forced him to Egypt, law school, and high ranks in Egyptian Baath party until he was able to return to Iraq. From there he was appointed successor to [[Michel Aflaq]], the father of the Baath party. In Saddam's efforts to become the Supreme Arab Nationalist Leader, he had to compete against Assad of [[Syria]].

Throughout his tenure, Saddam killed supporters who gave advice contrary to his thinking, and thus surrounded himself with sycophants. He warred with the [[Kurds]] and Iranians and was pragmatic enough to change his mind regarding the Shatt al Arab Waterway, his foreign hostage policy, and the War with Iran, which had started going badly for the Iraqis. To his mind, Saddam is Iraq and Iraq is Saddam. He was a [[Narcissism|narcissist]] who believed he was the chosen leader of the [[Arab world]], despite lack of support for the [[Kuwait]] invasion. Paranoid, he was convinced in conspiracies of the US, [[Israel]], and [[Iran]] to kill him. After the Kuwait invasion and defeat, he worked to shore up his forces and eventually began to trust party loyalists over his family, including two of his sons whom he killed after giving them amnesty. His goal is survival and a place in the world state with world class weapons. When backed into a corner, he fights with everything he has but can change his mind and compromise to be seen as a global leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Post|first=Jerrold|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Long-lived fission products''' (LLFPs) are radioactive materials with a long [[half-life]] (more than 200,000 years) produced by [[nuclear fission]] of [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]].

==Evolution of radioactivity in nuclear waste==
[[Nuclear fission]] produces [[fission products]], as well as [[actinide]]s from [[nuclear fuel]] nuclei that capture neutrons but fail to fission, and [[activation products]] from [[neutron activation]] of reactor or environmental materials.

===Short-term===
The high short-term [[radioactivity]] of [[spent nuclear fuel]] is primarily from fission products with short [[half-life]].
The radioactivity in the fission product mixture is mostly short-lived isotopes such as [[Iodine-131|&lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I]] and &lt;sup&gt;140&lt;/sup&gt;Ba, after about four months &lt;sup&gt;141&lt;/sup&gt;Ce, &lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;Zr/&lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;Nb and &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Sr take the largest share, while after about two or three years the largest share is taken by &lt;sup&gt;144&lt;/sup&gt;Ce/&lt;sup&gt;144&lt;/sup&gt;Pr, &lt;sup&gt;106&lt;/sup&gt;Ru/&lt;sup&gt;106&lt;/sup&gt;Rh and &lt;sup&gt;147&lt;/sup&gt;Pm.
Note that in the case of a release of radioactivity from a power reactor or used fuel, only some elements are released. As a result, the isotopic signature of the radioactivity is very different from an open air nuclear detonation where all the fission products are dispersed.

===Medium-lived fission products===
{{Medium-lived fission products}}After several years of cooling, most radioactivity is from the fission products [[caesium-137]] and [[strontium-90]], which are each produced in about 6% of fissions, and have half-lives of about 30 years. Other fission products with similar half-lives have much lower [[fission product yield]]s, lower [[decay energy]], and several (&lt;sup&gt;151&lt;/sup&gt;Sm, &lt;sup&gt;155&lt;/sup&gt;Eu, &lt;sup&gt;113m&lt;/sup&gt;Cd) are also quickly destroyed by [[neutron capture]] while still in the reactor, so are not responsible for more than a tiny fraction of the radiation production at any time. Therefore, in the period from several years to several hundred years after use, radioactivity of spent fuel can be modeled simply as [[exponential decay]] of the &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs and &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr. These are sometimes known as medium-lived fission products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nuclear Wastes: Technologies for Separations and Transmutation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRI7Cx2D4e4C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=%22medium-lived+fission+products%22#PPA25,M1 | isbn=978-0-309-05226-9 | year=1996 | publisher=National Academies Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nuclear Alchemy Gamble: An Assessment of Transmutation as a Nuclear Waste Management Strategy|url=http://www.ieer.org/reports/transm/hisham.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Krypton-85]], the 3rd most active MLFP, is a [[noble gas]] which is allowed to escape during current [[nuclear reprocessing]]; however, its inertness means that it does not concentrate in the environment, but diffuses to a uniform low concentration in the atmosphere. Spent fuel in the U.S. and some other countries is not likely to be reprocessed until decades after use, and by that time most of the &lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt;Kr will have decayed.
{{clear}}

===Actinides===
{{Actinidesvsfissionproducts}}
After &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs and &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr have decayed to low levels, the bulk of radioactivity from spent fuel come not from fission products but [[actinides]], notably [[plutonium-239]] (half-life 24&amp;nbsp;[[kiloannus|ka]]), [[plutonium-240]] (6.56&amp;nbsp;ka), [[americium-241]] (432&amp;nbsp;years), [[americium-243]] (7.37&amp;nbsp;ka), [[curium]]-245 (8.50&amp;nbsp;ka), and curium-246 (4.73&amp;nbsp;ka). These can be recovered by [[nuclear reprocessing]] (either before or after most &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs and &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr decay) and fissioned, offering the possibility of greatly reducing waste radioactivity in the time scale of about 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; years. &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu is usable as fuel in existing [[thermal reactor]]s, but some [[minor actinides]] like &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am, as well as the non-[[fissile]] and less-[[fertile material|fertile]] isotope [[plutonium-242]], are better destroyed in [[fast reactor]]s, accelerator-driven [[subcritical reactor]]s, or [[fusion reactor]]s.

===Long-lived fission products===
On scales greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; years, fission products, chiefly &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc, again represent a significant proportion of the remaining, though lower radioactivity, along with longer-lived actinides like [[neptunium-237]] and [[plutonium-242]], if those have not been destroyed.

The most abundant long-lived fission products have total [[decay energy]] around 100-300&amp;nbsp;keV, only part of which appears in the beta particle; the rest is lost to a [[neutrino]] that has no effect. In contrast, actinides undergo multiple [[alpha decay]]s, each with decay energy around 4-5&amp;nbsp;MeV.

Only seven fission products have long half-lives, and these are much longer than 30 years, in the range of 200,000 to 16 million years. These are known as long-lived fission products (LLFP). Two or three have relatively high yields of about 6%, while the rest appear at much lower yields. (This list of seven excludes isotopes with very slow decay and half-lives longer than the age of the universe, which are effectively stable and already found in nature; as well as a few nuclides like [[technetium]]-98 and [[samarium]]-146 that are "shadowed" from [[beta decay]] and can only occur as direct fission products, not as beta decay products of more neutron-rich initial fission products. The shadowed fission products have yields on the order of one millionth as much as iodine-129.)

==The 7 long-lived fission products==
{{Long-lived fission products}}
The first three have similar half-lives, between 200 thousand and 300 thousand years; the last four have longer half-lives, in the low millions of years.
#[[Technetium-99]] produces the largest amount of LLFP radioactivity. It emits [[beta particles]] of low to medium energy but no [[gamma ray]]s, so has little hazard on external exposure, but only if ingested. However, technetium's chemistry allows it to form [[anion]]s (pertechnetate, TcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt;) that are relatively mobile in the environment. Tons of technetium-99 have been released into the ocean.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}
#[[Tin-126]] has a large [[decay energy]] (due to its following short [[half-life]] [[decay product]]) and is the only LLFP that emits energetic [[gamma radiation]], which is an external exposure hazard. However, this isotope is produced in very small quantities in fission by [[thermal neutrons]], so the energy per unit time from &lt;sup&gt;126&lt;/sup&gt;Sn is only about 5% as much as from &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc for U-235 fission, or 20% as much for 65% U-235+35% Pu-239. [[Fast fission]] may produce higher yields. [[Tin]] is an inert metal with little mobility in the environment, helping to limit health risks from its radiation.
#[[Selenium-79]] is produced at low yields and emits only weak radiation. Its decay energy per unit time should be only about 0.2% that of Tc-99.
#[[Zirconium-93]] is produced at a relatively high yield of about 6%, but its decay is 7.5 times slower than Tc-99, and its decay energy is only 30% as great; therefore its energy production is initially only 4% as great as Tc-99, though this fraction will increase as the Tc-99 decays. &lt;sup&gt;93&lt;/sup&gt;Zr does produce gamma radiation, but of a very low energy, and [[zirconium]] is relatively inert in the environment.
#[[Caesium-135]]'s predecessor [[xenon-135]] is produced at a high rate of over 6% of fissions, but is an extremely potent absorber of thermal neutrons ([[neutron poison]]), so that most of it is transmuted to almost-stable xenon-136 before it can decay to caesium-135. If 90% of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe is destroyed, then the remaining &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Cs's decay energy per unit time is initially only about 1% as great as that of the &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc. In a fast reactor, less of the Xe-135 may be destroyed.&lt;br /&gt;[[Cs-135|&lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]] is the only [[alkaline]] or [[electropositive]] LLFP; in contrast, the main medium-lived fission products and the minor actinides other than neptunium are all alkaline and tend to stay together during reprocessing; with many reprocessing techniques such as salt solution or salt volatilization, &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Cs will also stay with this group, although some techniques such as high-temperature volatilization can separate it. Often the alkaline wastes are [[vitrified]] to form [[high level waste]], which will include the &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Cs.&lt;br /&gt;Fission caesium contains not only &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Cs but also stable but neutron-absorbing &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Cs (which wastes neutrons and forms [[Cs-134|&lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]] which is radioactive with a half-life of 2 years) as well as the common fission product [[Cs-137|&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]] which does not absorb neutrons but is highly radioactive, making handling more hazardous and complicated; for all these reasons, transmutation disposal of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Cs would be more difficult.
#[[Palladium-107]] has a very long half-life, a low yield (though the yield for plutonium fission is higher than the yield from [[uranium-235]] fission), and very weak radiation. Its initial contribution to LLFP radiation should be only about one part in 10000 for &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U fission, or 2000 for 65% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U+35% &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu. Palladium is a [[noble metal]] and extremely inert.
#[[Iodine-129]] has the longest [[half-life]], 15.7 million years, and due to its higher half life, lower fission fraction and decay energy it produces only about 1% the intensity of radioactivity as &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc. However, radioactive [[iodine]] is a disproportionate biohazard because the [[thyroid gland]] concentrates iodine. &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I has a half-life nearly a [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] times as long as its more hazardous sister isotope &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I; therefore, with a shorter half-life and a higher decay energy, &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I is approximately a billion times more radioactive than the longer-lived &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I.

==LLFP radioactivity compared==
In total, the other six LLFPs, in thermal reactor spent fuel, initially release only a bit more than 10% as much energy per unit time as Tc-99 for U-235 fission, or 25% as much for 65% U-235+35% Pu-239. About 1000 years after fuel use, radioactivity from the medium-lived fission products Cs-137 and Sr-90 drops below the level of radioactivity from Tc-99 or LLFPs in general. (Actinides, if not removed, will be emitting more radioactivity than either at this point.) By about 1 million years, Tc-99 radioactivity will have declined below that of Zr-93, though immobility of the latter means it is probably still a lesser hazard. By about 3 million years, Zr-93 decay energy will have declined below that of I-129.

[[Nuclear transmutation]] is under consideration as a disposal method, primarily for Tc-99 and I-129 as these both represent the greatest biohazards and have the greatest [[neutron capture]] [[Neutron cross-section|cross section]]s, although transmutation is still slow compared to fission of actinides in a reactor. Transmutation has also been considered for Cs-135, but is almost certainly not worthwhile for the other LLFPs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5157">'''Lydia Fairchild''' is an [[Americans|American]] woman who exhibits [[chimera (genetics)|chimerism]], in having two distinct populations of DNA among the cells of her body.  She was pregnant with her third child when she and the father of her children, Jamie Townsend, separated. When Fairchild applied for enforcement of child support in 2002, providing [[DNA profiling|DNA evidence]] of Townsend's paternity was a routine requirement. While the results showed Townsend to be certainly their father, they seemed to rule out her being their mother.

Fairchild stood accused of fraud by either claiming benefits for other people's children, or taking part in a [[surrogacy]] scam, and records of her prior births were put similarly in doubt. Prosecutors called for her two children to be taken away from her.{{dubious|date=September 2017|reason= "pros'r" is a role in a criminal trial. The logically related custody matter is a civil case with different *roles*, for attys, even if the prosecuter who brought the crim case happens  to bring the civil action. (Likelihood of same atty having both roles is ruffly proportional to both pop'n and level of litigousness in that jurisdiction, but even so would not be acting in role of pros'ctor in the custody matter.)}} As time came for her to give birth to her third child, the judge ordered that an observer be present at the birth, ensure that blood samples were immediately taken from both the child and Fairchild, and be available to testify. Two weeks later, DNA tests seemed to indicate that she was also not the mother of that child.

A breakthrough came when a lawyer for the prosecution{{cn|date= September 2017|reason = this might have been involved only in the civil matter, since this editor demonstrated ignorance or neglect of the distinction}} knew of  [[Karen Keegan]], a [[Chimera (genetics)|chimeric]] woman in Boston, and suggested the similar possibility to Fairchild's lawyer, Alan Tindell, who then introduced an article in the ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine|New England Journal of Medicine]]'' about Keegan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa013452|last=Yu|first=Neng|date=16 May 2002|title=Disputed Maternity Leading to Identification of Tetragametic Chimerism|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=346|issue=20|pages=1545â1552|pmid=12015394|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa013452|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowlands|first=Letitia|title=When your unborn twin is your children's mother|url=http://www.essentialbaby.com.au/life-style/nutrition-and-wellbeing/when-your-unborn-twin-is-your-childrens-mother-20140203-31woi.html|publisher=Essential Baby|accessdate=26 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301211020/http://www.essentialbaby.com.au/life-style/nutrition-and-wellbeing/when-your-unborn-twin-is-your-childrens-mother-20140203-31woi.html|archivedate=1 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He realised that Fairchild's case might also be caused by [[chimera (genetics)|chimerism]]. As in Keegan's case, DNA samples were taken  from members of the extended family. The DNA of Fairchild's children matched that of Fairchild's mother to the extent expected of a grandmother. They also found that, although the DNA in Fairchild's skin and hair did not match her children's, the DNA from a [[Pap test|cervical smear]] test did match. Fairchild was carrying two different sets of DNA, the defining characteristic of chimerism.&lt;!-- Chimerism is a largely insignificant medical anomoly. A "chimera" is a superstitious fantasy of the ancient, biologically benighted, Greek shitkickers (and even of their wisest shitkicker pre-scientists), making failure to clearly distinguish between the condition and a person exhibiting it a crime against humanity. --&gt;

== History ==

=== Founding and Vision ===

Moscow Aviation Institute (National Research University) was established on 20 March 1930 as Higher Aero-mechanical college (VAMU) by the order of Supreme Economic Council of the USSR in order to ensure training of qualified personnel for the aviation industry. The Aero-mechanical faculty of [[Bauman Moscow State Technical University]] formed the basis of the new university. On 29 August 1930, the university was renamed as Moscow Aviation Institute. In the beginning it had 3 departments, Aeronautical, Aircraft engines and Aerodynamics. On its 10th anniversary in 1940, the university had established itself as a premier aeronautical university with 38 departments, 22 laboratories and a Student design office and production facility. 

The uniqueness of the MAI is that historically it was created to train specialists for almost all departments and teams in [[OKB|the Design Bureaus]] of the aviation industry.

=== World War II ===

On 22 June 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. The students and faculty members were mobilized to work in aircraft workshops and design offices. Many students signed up to join the armed forces during the [[Battle of Moscow]], many continued to work aircraft production facilities and armaments workshops.

The university was partly evacuated to [[Almaty]], [[Kazakhstan]] under the leadership of [[Alexander Yakovlevich Bereznyak|Alexander Yakovlev]]. By 1942 the Moscow campus of MAI started functioning in parallel with the Almaty campus. It was in the workshops of MAI in Almaty, [[Mikhail Kalashnikov]], the legendary rifle designer worked on his [[AK-47]] assault rifle.

By 1943, the university was completely relocated back to Moscow. Members of the university were involved in research &amp; designing new combat aircraft and sub-systems, along with refining and redesigning existing aircraft, for the war effort.
{|style="margin: 0 auto;"

In 1945 the institute was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]].

=== Jet age &amp; Space age ===

Although prototypes of the first jet aircraft were made as far back as 1910 by [[Henri CoandÄ]], it war during World War II that significant developments were made.
[[Arkhip Lyulka]] designed the first Two-stage centrifugal compressor Turbojet in 1938. [[Alexander Bereznyak]] a graduate of MAI, designed the first jet aircraft in the USSR, the [[Bereznyak-Isayev BI-1]] in 1942.

After the war, the university placed special emphasis on developing new technology required for developing jet aircraft and was quick to adapt to new technologies.
this was emphasised in May 1946, during the second Student technical conference, faculty members of the institute defended 6 post-doctoral thesis and 14 Ph.Ds on various aspects regarding development of jet aircraft. On 26 April 1946, [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9]] became the first operational turbojet fighter in the USSR.

It was also in the same year Faculty of Radio electronics was established based on department of Radio-location, to assimilate newer technologies in the field of Radio location.

The era of helicopters began in USSR with two leading pioneers at MAI [[Boris Yuryev]], inventor of [[Swashplate]] in helicopters and [[Bratukhin]], they were awarded the state prize of the USSR in 1946. In 1952, department of helicopter design was established under the leadership of Prof. Boris Yuryev.

In 1955, the university celebrated its silver jubilee.

On 4 October 1957, the USSR launched the first artificial satellite opening up Space for mankind, graduates from MAI were deeply involved in the space program since its inception under the leadership of [[Sergey Korolev]], the legendary chief designer of head of the Soviet space program and [[Mikhail Tikhonravov]] chief designer of satellites [[Sputnik-3]], [[Luna-1]], [[Luna-3]], [[Luna-4]].

=== Cold War ===
During the cold war, students, faculty members and graduates of the university were involved in cutting edge research in the fields of Aeronautics, Missile development and armaments research. They were pivotal in keeping the USSR ahead in the arms race in close collaboration with the Aerospace and Defense industry and Research organizations like [[TsAGI]], National Institute of Aviation technologies, Russian scientific-research institute of aviation materials, Central institute of Aircraft engines, [[30th Central Scientific Research Institute, Ministry of Defence]], [[Gromov Flight Research Institute]] among others.

Key figures from the university during this era were Rostislav Belyakov chief designer of MIG-29, [[Myasishchev]], [[Mikhail Yangel]], Sergey Mikheev chief designer of Kamov helicopters, Marat Tishchenko of Mil helicopters, Mikhail Reshetnev and others.

In 1962, the University established the Student design office(ÐÐ¡ÐÐ â Ð¾Ð±ÑÐµÐ´Ð¸Ð½ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ðµ Ð¡ÐÐ ÑÐ°ÐºÑÐ»ÑÑÐµÑÐ¾Ð² Ð¸ ÐºÐ°ÑÐµÐ´Ñ), which integrated different faculties and departments within the institute to develop aircraft prototypes in-house and to provide greater exposure to students in design and production work. The Design office functions today as the OKKBES-MAI http://oskbes.ru/english.html.

== Moscow Aviation Institute (Moscow Aviation and Aerospace University) today ==

Currently, MAI is the only university in Russia, which provides highly qualified personnel for the entire aerospace product life cycle from system design to implementation of the cutting edge technologies in production, testing, utilisation, and aircraft recycling.

The present-day MAI is a unique institute of higher education where thorough theoretical knowledge are combined with various practical skills. More than 120 laboratories, 3 student design offices, 3 specialized resource centers, an experimental-design factory, and an aerodrome are available for the students.

In 1980 the institute was awarded the [[Order of the October Revolution]].

In 1993 Moscow Aviation Institute was given one more name: "State Technological University". To date, the development in the field of aeronautics and astronautics is based mostly on the activities of institute professors and alumnus of the university.

Moscow Aviation Institute is a large scientific research center. Significant scientific ideas are developed here; new technological principles are discovered; new devices are invented and constructed. Five fundamental scientific discoveries for dynamic systems have been patented; the opto-electronic device "Photon" designed here is now operating in outer space; innovative power sources based on new principles invented and constructed here are currently used in aircraft and aerospace system units, etc.

In October 2009, the MAI was ranked among the 12 best universities of the Russian Federation. The rank of a "National research university" was conferred to the institute by decision of the Russian Government.

On 31 March 2015 the Ministry of Education reorganized Moscow Aviation Institute (MAI) by annexation of the Russian State Technological University named after Tsiolkovsky (MATI).

== OSKBES MAI ==

The history of aircraft creation in the MAI (Moscow Aviation Institute) began simultaneously with the foundation of the institute in 1930. The modern design bureau in the MAI was formed in 1965 as a students one. It was engaged in creation of experimental pilot and remote controlled light aircraft, which were developed according to the requirements specifications of various organizations of the Ministry of Aviation Industry (MAP), the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MGA) and the Ministry of Defense (MOP).

In 1982 by the order of Ministry of Aircraft Industry the Design Bureau was transformed into a branch-wise experimental students aircraft construction design bureau of the MAI. The work was carried out by professional engineers. If necessary the co-workers from among the MAI students and teachers and also from among the workers of the industry were invited. The production facility of the MAI aircraft development plant (EOZ) in the experimental development shop (shop â 3) are manned by qualified technicians. The OSKBES work on the experimental aircraft engineering constantly received high estimations of the industry. Their technical novelty and utility are confirmed by nine Introduction Certificates and more than twenty Invention Certificates. By the end of 1980s six experimental aircraft of different types were designed and built: Kvant, Elf-D UAV, PS-01 small-sized UAV, Elf, Photon and Yunior aircraft.

The basic structure, address and the industrial areas occupied by it in the OSKBES MAI have remained the same. The EOZ MAI (shop â 3) and the MAPO (Moscow aircraft building plant) were used as an industrial base. On July 27, 1992 the application on realization the inspection work in the OKB MA for reception the certificate for the right to develop the civil aircraft engineering was sent to the Aviaregister of the MAK and the Air Industry Department of the Ministry of Industry of Russian Federation. It was made on behalf of the "Aviatika" joint-stock company. According to the inspection results the Aviaregister of the MAK issued Certificate â R-9 to the "Aviatika" joint-stock company with the right to develop light civil aircraft. It was on February 17, 1993.

Aircraft designed and developed at OSKBES include

A single-seater Aviatika-MAI-890 aircraft â passed certification, had a temporary Certificate of a type of 31 March 1994 â 52Ð-890, valid till 1 April 1995, is series produced by the RAC "MiG";
A two-seater Aviatika-MAI-890U aircraft is serially produced by the RAC "MiG";
An agricultural Aviatika-MAI-890SKh aircraft is serially produced by the RAC "MiG";
A single-seater Aviatika-MAI-900 aerobatics ("Akrobat")'
A two-seater Aviatika-MAI-910 with wings, folding on the ground;
An Aviatika-MAI-920 glider;
A single-seater Aviatika-MAI-890A autogyro, a pre-production model at the stage of flying test.
The basis for the "Aviatika" aircraft manufacture at the MAPO plant is the License Agreement concluded by this plant with the "Aviatika" joint-stock company on 10 April 1995 (contract â 4276).

The personnel of the OSKBES have continued to work in the field of light civil aircraft together with the MAPO MIG.

In April 27, 1998 the Aviaregister of Interstate Aviation Committee issued a Design Organization Certificate R-52 of the developer of light civil aircraft.

29 September 1999 eight members of our design bureau, Moscow Aviation Institute and RAC "MIG" were rewarded by "State Prize of the Russian Federation in science and technology" for designing and development of light multipurpose airplanes in a serial production. They are:

OSKBES MAI Chief Designer K. Zhidovetskiy (posthumously);
OSKBES MAI Deputy Chief Designer (after the death of K. Zhidovetskiy â
Chief Designer) N. Goryunov;
OSKBES MAI Deputy Chief Designer V. Demin;
OSKBES MAI Deputy Chief Designer V. Feigenbaum;
Rector of MAI A. Matveyenko;
Manager of MAI Experimental Plant P. Ogadzhanov;
General Manager of RAC "MIG" plant G. Nemov;
Deputy Manager of RAC "MIG" O. Chukantsev.

Autogyro MAI-205 made the first flight in 2001, chief designer Andrey Zorin.

In 2002 OSKBES MAI has started designing a new plane MAI-223. This plane made the first flight in 2004.

In 2003 OSKBES MAI started to work on different aircraft, airships and autogyros. It designed and produced gondolas, nacelles, fly-by-wire power plant controls and empennages of NPO "RosAeroSystems" airships Au-30 and Au-12M.

The design and development of Autogyro MAI-208 was started in 2006. The first MAI-208 is undergoing testing. OSKBES MAI presented MAI-208 at the 2nd International exhibition of the helicopter industry "HeliRussia-2009" (21...23 May 2009, Moscow). The new autogyro has caused the big interest of visitors and the press.

July 1, 2008 Vadim Demin was appointed Chief Designer of OSKBES MAI. The same year the design office has started working on a new multi-purpose four-seat twin engine aircraft MAI-407.

In 2009 OSKBES MAI started designing a new training glider MAI-227.

[[File:NEC 2008.jpg|thumb|200px|The National Electrical Code, 2008 edition]]
The '''National Electrical Code''' ('''NEC'''), or '''NFPA 70''', is a regionally adoptable standard for the safe installation of [[electrical wiring]] and equipment in the [[United States]]. It is part of the National Fire Codes series published by the [[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA), a private [[trade association]].&lt;ref&gt;"National Electrical Code" and "NEC" are registered trademarks of the NFPA.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the use of the term "national", it is not a [[Law of the United States|federal law]]. It is typically adopted by [[U.S. state|states]] and municipalities in an effort to standardize their enforcement of safe electrical practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electricalcodecoalition.org/state-adoptions.aspx "Adoption of the National Electrical Code"], NEMA.org&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the NEC is amended, altered and may even be rejected in lieu of regional regulations as voted on by local governing bodies.

The "[[authority having jurisdiction]]" inspects for compliance with these minimum standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firewatchtrainingdvd.com/firewatch-training-dvd/what-are-the-area-classifications-for-a-fire/|title=What Are The NEC Area Classifications for a Firewatch?|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/doc/outreachtraining/htmlfiles/elecstd.html|title=Electrical Standards for Construction|publisher=U.S. DOL, OSHA|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The NEC is developed by NFPA's Committee on the National Electrical Code, which consists of 19 (20 in 2008) code-making panels and a technical correlating committee.  Work on the NEC is sponsored by the National Fire Protection Association.  The NEC is approved as an American national standard by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI). It is formally identified as ANSI/NFPA 70.

First published in 1897, the NEC is updated and published every three years, with the 2017 edition being the most current.  Most states adopt the most recent edition within a few of years of its publication.  As with any "uniform" code, jurisdictions may regularly omit or modify some sections, or add their own requirements (sometimes based upon earlier versions of the NEC, or locally accepted practices).  However, no court has faulted anyone for using the latest version of the NEC, even when the local code was not updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ccIJAAAAQBAJ|title=Electrical Pre-Apprenticeship and Workforce Development Manual|last=Chesapeake|first=I. E. C.|last2=WECA|date=2012-01-08|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1133710751|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., anyone, including the city issuing building permits, may face a civil [[Legal liability|liability]] [[lawsuit]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; for negligently creating a situation that results in loss of life or property.  Those who fail to adhere to well known best practices for safety have been held negligent.  This liability and the desire to protect residents has motivated cities to adopt and enforce [[building code]]s that specify standards and practices for [[electrical]] systems (as well as other departments such as water and fuel-gas systems).  This creates a system whereby a city can best avoid lawsuits by adopting a single, standard set of building code laws.  This has led to the NEC becoming the [[de facto]] standard set of electrical requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nema.org/Technical/FieldReps/Documents/NEC-Adoption-Map.pdf|title=NEC Adoption Map By State|last=|first=|date=March 2016|website=|publisher=National Electrical Manufacturers Association|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A licensed [[electrician]] will have spent years of [[apprenticeship]] studying and practicing the NEC requirements prior to obtaining his or her license.

The Deactivation and Decommissioning (D&amp;D) customized extension of the electrical code standard defined by National Electrical Code was developed since current engineering standards and code requirements do not adequately address the unique situations arising during D&amp;D activities at U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) facilities. The additional guidance is needed to clarify the current electrical code for these situations. The guidance document provides guidance on how to interpret selected articles of NFPA 70, âNational Electrical Codeâ (NEC), in particular certain articles within Article 590, âTemporary Power,â for D&amp;D electrical activities at DOE sites.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dndkm.org/DOEKMDocuments/BestPractices/24-EFCOG%20Best%20Practice%20-%20Electrical%20Code%20Guidance%20for%20DD%20-final%20to%20EFCOG.pdf Electrical Code Guidance for Decontamination and Decommissioning Activities at DOE Facilities](D&amp;D KM-IT Best Practice)&lt;/ref&gt;

The NEC also contains information about the official definition of [[HAZLOC]] and the related standards given by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] and dealing with hazardous locations such as explosive atmospheres.

===Public access===

The NEC is available as a bound book containing approximately 1000 pages. It has been available in electronic form since the 1993 edition. Although the code is updated every three years, some jurisdictions do not immediately adopt the new edition.

The NEC is also available as a restricted, digitized ''coding model'' that can be read online but not saved, copied and pasted, or printed, free of charge on certain computing platforms that support the restricted viewer software.

In the United States, statutory law cannot be copyrighted and is freely accessible and copyable by anyone.&lt;ref&gt;Link to text of the court's decision for 293 F.3d 791, Peter VEECK, doing business as RegionalWeb, Plaintiff-Counter Defendant-Appellant, v. SOUTHERN BUILDING CODE CONGRESS INTERNATIONAL, INC., Defendant-Counter Claimant-Appellee., No. 99-40632, United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, June 7, 2002 https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F3/293/293.F3d.791.99-40632.html&lt;/ref&gt; When a standards organization develops a new coding model and it is not yet accepted by any jurisdiction as law, it is still the private property of the standards organization and the reader may be restricted from downloading or printing the text for offline viewing. For that privilege, the coding model must still be purchased as either printed media or a CD-ROM. Once the coding model has been accepted as law, it loses copyright protection and may be freely obtained at no cost.

Archive.org and many state or local government sites allow download of the NEC without the registration that the NFPA requires.

External links to both the restricted NEC online access and free public access sites are referenced at the end of this article.

==Structure==
The NEC is composed of an introduction, nine chapters, annexes A through J, and the index. The introduction sets forth the purpose, scope, enforcement and rules or information that are general in nature. The first four chapters cover definitions and rules for installations (voltages, connections, markings, etc.), circuits and circuit protection, methods and materials for wiring (wiring devices, conductors, cables, etc.), and general-purpose equipment (cords, receptacles, switches, heaters, etc.). The next three chapters deal with special occupancies (high risk to multiple persons), special equipment (signs, machinery, etc.) and special conditions (emergency systems, alarms, etc.). Chapter 8 is specific to additional requirements for communications systems (telephone, radio/TV, etc.) and chapter 9 is composed of tables regarding conductor, cable and conduit properties, among other things.  Annexes A-J relate to referenced standards, calculations, examples, additional tables for proper implementation of various code articles (for example, how many wires fit in a conduit) and a model adoption ordinance.

The introduction and the first 8 chapters contain numbered articles, parts, sections (or lists or tables) italicized exceptions, and Informational notes â explanations that are not part of the rules.  Articles are coded with numerals and letters, as ###.###(A)(#)(a). For example, 804.22(C)(3)(b) would be read as "section 804 point 22(C)(3)(b)." and would be found in chapter 8.  For internal references, some lengthy articles are further broken into "parts" with Roman-numerals (parts I, II, III, etc.).

Each code article is numbered based on the chapter it is in. Those wiring methods acceptable by the NEC are found in chapter 3, thus all approved wiring method code articles are in the 300s. Efforts have been underway for some time to make the code easier to use. Some of those efforts include using the same extension in those code articles for the support of wiring methods.

The NFPA also publishes a 1,497-page NEC Handbook (for each new NEC edition) that contains the entire code, plus additional illustrations and explanations, and helpful cross-references within the code and to earlier versions of the code. The explanations are only for reference and are not enforceable.
[[File:Underwriters Laboratories logo.svg|thumb|Underwriters Laboratories, one of many of the testing laboratories recognized by OSHA.|200x200px]]
Many NEC requirements refer to "listed" or "labeled" devices and appliances, and this means that the item has been designed, manufactured, tested or inspected, and marked in accordance with requirements of the listing agency. To be '''listed''', the device must meet testing and other requirements set by a listing agency such as [[Underwriters Laboratories]] (UL), [[SGS S.A.|SGS North America]], [[Intertek]] (Formerly ETL), [[Canadian Standards Association]] (CSA), or [[FM Global|FM Approvals]] (FM). These are examples of "national recognized testing laboratories" (NRTLs) approved by the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) under the requirements of 29CFR1910.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dts/otpca/nrtl/nrtllist.html|title=Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories (NRTLs) {{!}} Current List of NRTLs|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a listed device can carry the listing brand (or "mark") of the listing agency.  Upon payment of an investigation fee to determine suitability, an investigation is started. To be '''labeled''' as fit for a particular purpose (for example "wet locations", "domestic range") a device must be tested for that specific use by the listing agency and then the appropriate label applied to the device.  A fee is paid to the listing agency for each item so labeled, that is, for each label. Most NRTLs will also require that the manufacturer's facilities and processes be inspected as evidence that a product will be manufactured reliably and with the same qualities as the sample or samples submitted for evaluation. An NRTL may also conduct periodic sample testing of off-the-shelf products to confirm that safety design criteria are being upheld during production. Because of the reputation of these listing agencies, the "authority having jurisdiction" ( or "AHJ" â as they are commonly known) usually will quickly accept any device, appliance, or piece of equipment having such a label, provided that an end user or installer uses the product in accordance with manufacturer's instructions and the limitations of the listing standard. However, an AHJ, under the National Electrical Code provisions, has the authority to deny approval for even listed and labeled products.  Likewise, an AHJ may make a written approval of an installation or product that does not meet either NEC or listing requirements, although this is normally done only after an appropriate review of the specific conditions of a particular case or location.

The 2008 Code has user-friendly features to aid the reader in seeing changes.  Revisions or additions to the articles from the 2005 version are highlighted in gray shading.  Where sections have been deleted, a bullet (â¢) is shown between the paragraphs that remain.

==High and low voltage rule classification==
The electric code makes a distinction between "high" voltages (100&amp;nbsp;volts and higher), and "low" voltages below that, and which have two different safety classifications and regulations. For circuits defined as low voltage, in some jurisdictions, there is no requirement for licensing, training, or certification of installers, and no inspection of completed work is required, for either residential or commercial work. Low voltage cabling run in the walls and ceilings of commercial buildings is also typically excluded from the requirements to be installed in protective conduit.

The precise reasoning for the selection of 100&amp;nbsp;volts as the division between high and low is not clearly defined, but appears to be based on the idea that a person could touch the wires carrying low voltage with dry bare hands, and not be [[electrocuted]], injured, or killed. This is generally true for 12&amp;nbsp;volt systems, but becomes more ambiguous as the voltage increases to 100&amp;nbsp;volt.

The meaning also varies when alternating current is used, as there is the more commonly known [[root mean square voltage]] (120&amp;nbsp;V) but also a peak wave voltage (170&amp;nbsp;V). Telephones for example use low voltage cabling, but the [[Ringing (telephony)|ringing voltage]] from the central office is approximately 90&amp;nbsp;volts peak AC and has an RMS voltage of 63&amp;nbsp;V.

In more recent terms, the upper cutoff for what is considered low is approximately 50 Volts, with most computer network equipment operating at 48 Volts DC or lower, and not requiring special training to connect or use.

Although low voltage cabling does not require inspection or training to install in some jurisdictions, it is still important for installers to be aware of specific electric code safety rules such as how to correctly penetrate [[Firewall (construction)|building fire barriers]] and use firestop putty ([[intumescent]]s) to prevent a low voltage cable from reducing building fire protection and increasing the risk of injury or death for building occupants. Access to such safety information is typically restricted and limited access by the electrical industry itself so as to only permit licensed professionals to learn the NEC rules and educate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Only licensed professionals are permitted to discuss code rules on the NEC forum [http://forums.mikeholt.com/misc.php?do=showrules Mike Holt].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
Article 210 addresses "branch circuits" (as opposed to service or feeder circuits) and receptacles and fixtures on branch circuits.&lt;ref&gt;Electrical Construction and Maintenance Magazine, Branch Circuits, Part 2, http://ecmweb.com/nec/code-basics/electric_branch_circuits_part_2/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; There are requirements for the minimum number of branches, and placement of receptacles, according to the location and purpose of the receptacle outlet.  Ten important items in Article 210 have been summarized in a codebook.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codebookcity.com/codearticles/nec/necarticle210.htm National Electrical Code Top Ten Tips: Article 210, Branch Circuits&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Feeder and branch circuit wiring systems are designed primarily for [[Copper wire and cable|copper conductors]]. [[Aluminum wiring]] is listed by [[Underwriters Laboratories]] for interior wiring applications and became increasingly used around 1966 due to its lower cost. Prior to 1972, however, the aluminum wire used was manufactured to conform to the 1350 series aluminum alloy, but this alloy was eventually deemed unsuitable for branch circuits due to [[galvanic corrosion]] where the copper and aluminum touched, resulting in poor contact and resistance to current flow, connector overheating problems, and potential fire risk. Today, a new aluminum wire (AA-8000) has been approved for branch circuits that does not cause corrosion where it contacts copper, but it is not readily available and is not manufactured below size #8 AWG. Hence, [[Copper wire and cable|copper wire]] is used almost exclusively in branch circuitry.

A [[Residual-current device|ground fault circuit interrupter]] (GFCI) is required for all receptacles in wet locations defined in the Code.  The NEC also has rules about how many circuits and receptacles should be placed in a given residential dwelling, and how far apart they can be in a given type of room, based upon the typical cord length of small appliances.

[[File:PolarizedOutlet.svg|right|frame|Polarized, grounding, 120 Volt receptacle]]

As of 1962 the NEC required that new 120 Volt household receptacle outlets, for general purpose use, be both ''[[Ground (electricity)|grounded]]'' and ''polarized''.  [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association|NEMA]] connectors implement these requirements.

The NEC also permits grounding-type receptacles in non-grounded wiring protected by a GFCI.  [[File:220sb.svg|left|170px|thumb|240 V receptacle faces]]
The 1999 Code required that new 240 Volt receptacles be grounded also, which necessitates a fourth slot in their faces.  Changes in standards often create problems for new work in old buildings.
[[File:Leviton Dual Function AFCI GFCI Receptacle.jpg|thumb|A 120 Volt combination AFCI/GFCI receptacle|330x330px]]
Unlike circuit breakers and fuses, which only open the circuit when the current exceeds a fixed value for a fixed time, a GFCI device will interrupt electrical service when more than 4 to 6 milliamperes of current in either conductor leaks to ground. A GFCI detects an imbalance between the current in the "hot" side and the current in the "neutral" side.  One GFCI receptacle can serve as protection for several downstream conventional receptacles.  GFCI devices come in many configurations including circuit-breakers, portable devices and receptacles.

Another safety device introduced with the 1999 code is the [[arc-fault circuit interrupter]] (AFCI).  This device detects arcs from hot to neutral that can develop when insulation between wires becomes frayed or damaged.  While arcs from hot to neutral would not trip a GFCI device since current is still balanced, circuitry in an AFCI device detects those arcs and will shut down a circuit.  AFCI devices generally replace the circuit breaker in the circuit. As of the 1999 National Electrical Code, AFCI protection is required in new construction on all 15- and 20-amp, 125-volt circuits to bedrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afcisafety.org/codes.html|title=AFCISafety.org|website=www.afcisafety.org|access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conduit and cable protection===
In home construction, wiring is commonly allowed directly in walls without additional protection. However, in commercial and industrial buildings, wiring must be protected from damage, so it is more commonly installed inside metal or plastic [[Electrical conduit|conduit]] or ductwork, or passageways cast in concrete.

While some types of cable are protected by flexible spiraled metal armor, it is more common to install conduit and empty ductwork and pull the wire in later. The NEC spends considerable time documenting safe methods of installing cable in conduit, the primary concerns being the abrading of insulation, damage to the wire or insulation caused by sharp bends, kinking, and damage due to excess pulling strain.

A wire pulled with excessive force may break inside the conduit, requiring costly removal and replacement. However, a wire pulled with enough force to stretch the wire, but not break it, creates a hazard of future failure or fire. The stretched wire section will have a thinner cross section and higher resistance than other parts of the cable, and may have damaged insulation.  Breaks may form in the stretched insulation, which may not be discovered until the circuit is powered and damage from arcing or shorting has occurred.

Wires must be protected from sharp metal edges of cut conduits or cabinet holes. The NEC specifies measures to protect wire insulation from damage by these edges during installation and  use. For example, insulated cables may not be inserted directly through knockouts, due to the sharp edge around nearly all knockout holes. Clamping and other wire protection is often not required for plastic conduit parts, as plastic is not likely to damage insulation in contact with it.

In [[Electrical equipment in hazardous areas|hazardous locations]], more robust cable protection may be necessary. Common conduit and ductwork protects against direct physical abuse, but is neither air nor water tight. In wet locations, conduit may resemble standard threaded pipe in appearance, with gasketed box openings to keep moisture out. Areas with potentially explosive gases need further protection to prevent electrical sparks from igniting the gases, and internal conduit gas-tight barriers to prevent potentially ignited gases from traveling inside the conduit to other parts of the building.

Most commonly-available circuit breakers are rated to carry no more than 80% of their nominal rating continuously (3 hours or more) (NEC Art. 100).  100%-rated circuit breakers are manufactured for and may carry 100% of their nominal rating continuously.

===Temperature rating===
The temperature rating of a wire or cable is generally the maximum safe ambient temperature that the wire can carry full-load power without the cable insulation melting, oxidizing, or self-igniting. A full-load wire does heat up slightly due to the metallic resistance of the wire, but this wire heating is factored into the cable's temperature rating. (NEC 310.10)

The NEC specifies acceptable numbers of conductors in crowded areas such as inside conduit, referred to as the ''fill rating''. If the accepted fill rating is exceeded, then all the cables in the conduit are ''derated'', lowering their acceptable maximum ambient [[operating temperature]]. Derating is necessary because multiple conductors carrying full-load power generate heat that may exceed the normal insulation temperature rating. (NEC 310.16)

The NEC also specifies adjustments of the ampacity for wires in circular raceways exposed to sunlight on rooftops, due to the heating effects of solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;Electrical Construction and Maintenance Magazine, Conductors for General Use, http://ecmweb.com/nec/code-basics/conductors-for-general-use-20110901; See Chapter 3 Articles in NEC, starting with Article 342&lt;/ref&gt; This section is expected to be modified to include cables in future editions.

In certain situations, temperature rating can be higher than normal, such as for [[knob-and-tube wiring]] where two or more load-carrying wires are never likely to be in close proximity. A knob-and-tube installation uses wires suspended in air. This gives them a greater heat dissipation rating than standard three-wire NM-2 cable, which includes two tightly bundled load and return wires.

A '''next-generation firewall''' ('''NGFW''') is a part of the third generation of firewall technology, combining a traditional [[firewall (computing)|firewall]] with other network device filtering functionalities, such as an [[application firewall]] using in-line [[deep packet inspection]] (DPI), an [[intrusion prevention system]] (IPS). Other techniques might also be employed, such as [[TLS/SSL]] encrypted traffic inspection, website filtering, QoS/[[bandwidth management]], [[antivirus software|antivirus inspection]] and third-party [[identity management]] integration (i.e. [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]], [[RADIUS]], [[Active Directory]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esecurityplanet.com/security-buying-guides/intro-to-next-generation-firewalls.html Intro to Next Generation Firewalls] - By Eric Geier, 06 September, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Next-generation firewall vs. traditional firewall ==
NGFWs include the typical functions of traditional firewalls such as packet filtering,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnmeonline.com/features/next-gen-security/ Next gen security] - by Ben Rossi - 07 August, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; network- and port-address translation (NAT), stateful inspection, and [[virtual private network]] (VPN) support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niiconsulting.com/solutions/next-generation-firewalls.html Next Generation Firewall (NGFW)] - Network Intelligence&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of next-generation firewalls is to include more layers of the [[OSI model]], improving filtering of network traffic that is dependent on the packet contents.

NGFWs perform deeper inspection compared to [[stateful inspection]] performed by the [[firewall (computing)|first- and second-generation firewalls]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/next-generation-firewalls-security-without-compromising-performance/8545/ Next-generation firewalls: Security without compromising performance] - By Patrick Sweeney, 17 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; NGFWs use a more thorough inspection style, checking packet payloads and matching signatures for harmful activities such as exploitable attacks and malware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkcomputing.com/security/next-generation-firewalls-101/240149730 Next-Generation Firewalls 101] - By Frank J. Ohlhorst, 1 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution of next-generation firewalls ==

Improved detection of encrypted applications and intrusion prevention service. Modern threats like web-based malware attacks, targeted attacks, application-layer attacks, and more have had a significantly negative effect on the threat landscape. In fact, more than 80% of all new malware and intrusion attempts are exploiting weaknesses in applications, as opposed to weaknesses in networking components and services.

Stateful firewalls with simple packet filtering capabilities were efficient blocking unwanted applications as most applications met the port-protocol expectations. Administrators could promptly prevent an unsafe application from being accessed by users by blocking the associated ports and protocols. But today, blocking a [[web application]] like [[Farmville]] that uses port 80 by closing the port would also mean complications with the entire [[HTTP]] protocol.

Protection based on ports, protocols, IP addresses is no more reliable and viable. This has led to the development of [[identity-based security]] approach, which takes organizations a step ahead of conventional security appliances which bind security to IP-addresses.

NGFWs offer administrators a deeper awareness of and control over individual applications, along with deeper inspection capabilities by the firewall. Administrators can create very granular "allow/deny" rules for controlling use of websites and applications in the network.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15996">'''Number sense in animals''' is the ability of creatures to represent and discriminate quantities of relative sizes by [[number sense]]. It has been observed in various species, from [[fish]] to [[primate]]s. Animals are believed to have an [[approximate number system]], the same system for number representation demonstrated by humans, which is more precise for smaller quantities and less so for larger values. An exact representation of numbers higher than 3 has not been attested in wild animals,&lt;ref name="Hauser"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hauser|first=Marc D.|author2=Carey, Susan|author3=Hauser, Lilan B.|title=Spontaneous number representation in semiâfreeâranging rhesus monkeys.|year=2000|journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1078}}&lt;/ref&gt; but can be demonstrated after a period of training in captive animals.

In order to distinguish number sense in animals from the symbolic and verbal number system in humans researchers use the term ''numerosity'',&lt;ref name="Dehaene"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dehaene|first=Stanislas|title=The Number Sense: How the mind creates Mathematics|year=2011|publisher= Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than ''number'', to refer to the concept that supports approximate estimation but does not support an exact representation of number quality.

Number sense in animals includes the recognition and comparison of number quantities. Some numerical operations, such as addition, have been demonstrated in many species, including rats and great apes. Representing fractions and fraction addition has been observed in chimpanzees. A wide range of species with an approximate number system suggests an early evolutionary origin of this mechanism or multiple [[convergent evolution]] events.

==Early studies==

[[File:Osten und Hans.jpg|thumb|Wilhelm von Osten and Clever Hans]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, Wilhelm von Osten famously, but prematurely, claimed human-like counting abilities in animals on the example of his horse named Hans.  His claim is widely rejected today, as it is attributed to a methodological fallacy, which received the name [[Clever Hans]] phenomenon after this case. Von Osten claimed that his horse could perform arithmetic operations presented to the horse in writing or verbally, upon which the horse would knock on the ground with its hoof the number of times that corresponded to the answer. This apparent ability was demonstrated numerous times in the presence of the horse's owner and a wider audience, and was also observed when the owner was absent.  However, upon a rigorous investigation by [[Oskar Pfungst]] in the first decade of 20th century, Hans' ability was shown to be not arithmetic in nature, but to be the ability to interpret minimal unconscious changes in body language of people when the correct answer was approaching. Today, the arithmetic abilities of Clever Hans are commonly rejected and the case serves as a reminder to the scientific community about the necessity of rigorous control for experimenter expectation in experiments.&lt;ref name=Dehaene /&gt;

There were, however, other early and more reliable studies on number sense in animals. A prominent example is the work of [[Otto Koehler]], who conducted a number of studies on number sense in animals between 1920s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="Rilling"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rilling|first=Mark|title=Invisible counting animals: A history of contributions from comparative psychology, ethology, and learning theory.|year=1993|journal=The development of numerical competence: Animal and human models|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his studies&lt;ref name="Koehler"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koehler|first=Otto |title="ZÃ¤hl"-Versuche an einem Kolkraben und Vergleichsversuche an Menschen.|journal= Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Tierpsychologie|year=1943|pages=575â712|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1943.tb00665.x|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; he showed that a raven named Jacob could reliably distinguish the number 5 across different tasks. This study was remarkable in that Koehler provided a systematic control condition in his experiment, which allowed him to test the number ability of the raven separately from the ability of the raven to encode other features, such as size and location of the objects. However, Koehler's work was largely overlooked in the English-speaking world, due to the limited availability of his publications, which were in German and partially published during World War II.

The experimental setup for the study of numerical cognition in animals was further enriched by the work of [[Francis Mechner|Francis]]&lt;ref name="Mechner"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mechner|first=Francis |title=Probability relations within response sequences under ratio reinforcement|journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|year=1958|pages=109â121|doi= 10.1901/jeab.1958.1-109|volume=1|pmc=1403928}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Platt and Johnson.&lt;ref name="Platt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Platt|first=John R|author2=Johnson, David M. |title=Localization of position within a homogeneous behavior chain: Effects of error contingencies.|journal=Learning and Motivation|year=1958|pages=386â414}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their experiments, the researchers deprived rats of food and then taught them to press a lever a specific number of times to obtain food. The rats learned to press the lever approximately the number of times specified by the researchers. Additionally, the researchers showed that rats' behavior was dependent on the number of required presses, and not for example on the time of pressing, as they varied the experiment to include faster and slower behavior on the rat's part by controlling how hungry the animal was.

== Methodology ==
Examining the representation of numerosity in animals is a challenging task, since it is not possible to use language as a medium. Because of this, carefully designed experimental setups are required to differentiate between numerical abilities and other phenomena, such as the Clever Hans phenomenon, memorization of the single objects or perception of object size and time.Also these abilities are seen only from the past few decades and not form the time of evolution.

One of the ways that numerical ability is thought to be demonstrated is the transfer of the concept of numerosity across modalities. This was for example the case in the experiment of Church and Meck,&lt;ref name="Church"&gt;{{cite book|last=Church|first=Russell M.|author2=Meck, Warren H.|chapter=The numerical attribute of stimuli.|year=1984|title= Animal Cognition|pages=445â464|isbn= 0898593344|editors=H.L. Roitblat, T.G. Bever, &amp; H.S. Terrace}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which rats learned to "add" the number of light flashes to the number of tones to find out the number of expected lever presses, showing a concept of numerosity independent of visual and auditory modalities.

Modern studies in number sense in animals try to control for other possible explanations of animal behavior by establishing control conditions in which the other explanations are tested. For example, when the number sense is investigated on the example of apple pieces, an alternative explanation is tested that assumes that the animal represents the volume of apple rather than a number of apple pieces. To test this alternative, an additional condition is introduced in which the volume of the apple varies and is occasionally smaller in the condition with a greater number of pieces. If the animal prefers a bigger number of pieces also in this condition, the alternative explanation is rejected, and the claim of numerical ability supported.&lt;ref name="Hauser"/&gt;

== Approximate number and parallel individuation systems ==
Numerosity is believed&lt;ref name="Hyde"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyde|first=D.|title=Two systems of non-symbolic numerical cognition|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|year=2011|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2011.00150}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to be represented by two separate systems in animals, similarly to humans. The first system is the [[approximate number system]], an imprecise system used for estimations of quantities. This system is distinguished by distance and magnitude effects, which means that a comparison between numbers is easier and more precise when the distance between them is smaller and when the values of the numbers are smaller.  The second system for representation of numerosity is the [[parallel individuation system]] which supports the exact representation of numbers from 1 to 4. In addition, humans can represent numbers through symbolic systems, such as language.

The distinction between the approximate number system and the parallel individuation system is, however, still disputed, and some experiments&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Simon|author2=Low, Jason|author3=Burns, K.|title=Adaptive numerical competency in a food-hoarding songbird.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|year=2008|volume=275|doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0702|pages=2373â2379|pmc=2603231}}&lt;/ref&gt; record behavior that can be fully explained with the approximate number system, without the need to assume another separate system for smaller numbers. For example, New Zealand robins repeatedly selected larger quantities of cached food with a precision that correlated with the total number of cache pieces. However, there was no significant discontinuity in their performance between small (1 to 4) and larger (above 4) sets, which would be predicted by the parallel individuation system. On the other hand, other experiments only report knowledge of numbers up to 4, supporting the existence of the parallel individuation system and not the approximate number system.&lt;ref name="Hauser"/&gt;

== Number sense by species ==

=== Fish ===
An approximate number system has been found in a number of fish species, such as [[guppy|guppies]], [[green swordtail]]s and [[mosquitofish]]. For example, preference for a bigger social group in mosquitofish was exploited to test the ability of the fish to discriminate numerosity.&lt;ref name= "agrillo2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agrillo|first=Christian|author2=Dadda, M|author3=Serena, G|author4=Bisazza, A|title=Do fish count? Spontaneous discrimination of quantity in female mosquitofish.|journal=Animal Cognition|year=2008|volume=11|issue=3|doi=10.1007/s10071-008-0140-9|pages=495â503}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fish successfully discriminated between different amounts up to three, after which they could discriminate groups if the difference between them also increased so that the ratio of the two groups was 1:2. Similarly, guppies discriminated between values up to 4, after which they only detected differences when the ratio between the two quantities was 1:2.&lt;ref name= "agrillo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agrillo|first=Christian|title=Evidence for Two Numerical Systems That Are Similar in Humans and Guppies|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=2|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0031923|pages=e31923|pmid=22355405|pmc=3280231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rats ===
Rats have demonstrated behavior consistent with an approximate number system&lt;ref name=Dehaene /&gt; in experiments where they had to learn to press a lever a specified number of times to obtain food. While they did learn to press the lever the amount specified by the researchers, between 4 and 16, their behavior was approximate, proportional to the number of lever presses expected from them. This means that for the target number of 4, the rats' responses varied from 3 to 7, and for the target number of 16 the responses varied from 12 to 24, showing a much greater interval.&lt;ref name="Platt"/&gt; This is compatible with the approximate number system and magnitude and distance effects.

=== Birds ===
Birds were one of the first animal species tested on their number sense. A raven named Jacob was able to distinguish the number 5 across different tasks in the experiments by Otto Koehler.&lt;ref name="Koehler"/&gt; Later experiments supported the claim of existence of a number sense in birds, with [[Alex (parrot)|Alex]], a grey parrot, able to label and comprehend labels for sets with up to six elements.&lt;ref name="Pepperberg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pepperberg|first=Irene M. |author2=Gordon, Jesse D|title=Number comprehension by a grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus), including a zero-like concept.|journal= Journal of Comparative Psychology|year=2005|page=197|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.119.2.197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies suggest that pigeons can also represent numbers up to 6 after an extensive training.&lt;ref name="Xia"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xia|first=Li |author2=Sieman, Martina|author3=Delius Juan D. |title=Matching of numerical symbols with number of responses by pigeons|journal= Animal Cognition|year=2000|pages=35â43|doi=10.1007/s100710050048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dogs ===
A sense of number has also been found in dogs. For example, dogs were able&lt;ref name="West"&gt;{{cite journal|last=West|first=Rebecca |author2=Rebecca, E|author3=Young, Robert J. |title=Do domestic dogs show any evidence of being able to count?|journal= Animal Cognition|year=2002|volume=5|pages=183â186.|doi=10.1007/s10071-002-0140-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; to perform simple additions of two objects, as revealed by their surprise when the result was incorrect. It is however argued that wolves perform better on quantity discrimination tasks than dogs and that this could be a result of a less demanding natural selection for number sense in dogs.&lt;ref name="Range"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Range|first=Federike|author2=Jenikejew, J|author3=SchrÃ¶der, I|author4=VirÃ¡nyi, Z|title=Difference in quantity discrimination in dogs and wolves.|journal= Front. Psychol. |volume=5 |pages=1299|year=2014|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monkeys ===
[[Rhesus macaque|Rhesus monkeys]] seem to have an innate understanding of numbers up to 4. This is shown by the study on semi-free-ranging rhesus monkeys in their natural environment&lt;ref name="Hauser"/&gt; in which the monkeys spontaneously discriminated numbers from 1 to 3 but did not demonstrate a numerical ability beyond this number. In another study that included training, rhesus monkeys showed the ability to generalize this knowledge to numerosities up to nine.&lt;ref name="Brannon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brannon|first=Elisabeth M.|author2=Herbert, Terrace S.|title=Ordering of the Numerosities 1 to 9 by Monkeys.|year=1988|journal= Science, New Series|volume=282|number=5389|doi=10.1126/science.282.5389.746|pmid=9784133|pages=746â9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chimpanzees ===
[[Chimpanzees]] are believed to have a sense of number, albeit an imprecise one. While they can correctly compare numbers such as 6 and 7 by choosing a tray with more pieces of reward, their performance is more error-free when the difference between the numbers is bigger and when the numbers are smaller; that is when the distance and magnitude effects take place. Chimpanzees also seem to have knowledge of proportions. In an experiment by Woodroof and Premack&lt;ref name="Woodruff"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woodruff|first=Guy|author2=David Premack|title=Primative &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; mathematical concepts in the chimpanzee: proportionality and numerosity |year=1981 |journal=Nature |volume=293 |issue=5833 |pages=568â570|doi=10.1038/293568a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; an adult chimpanzee correctly identified and performed operations on exemplars of numbers and proportions presented on a variety of objects, such as apples, wood disks and water containers. For example, when presented with {{fraction|1|4}} of an apple and {{fraction|1|2}} full water container, the chimpanzee chose {{fraction|3|4}} of a wooden disk, suggesting an addition-like ability. The ability to add fractions has only been demonstrated in primates so far.&lt;ref name=Dehaene /&gt;

{{For|the work by H. G. Wells|The Outline of History}}

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to history:

'''[[History]]''' â discovery, collection, organization, and presentation of information about past events. History can also mean the period of time after writing was invented (the beginning of  [[recorded history]]).


== Nature of history ==
History can be described as all of the following:
* [[Academic discipline]] â body of knowledge given to â or received by â a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialise in.
** one of the [[humanities]] â academic discipline that study the human condition, using methods that are primarily analytical, critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences.
* [[Fields of science|Field of science]]  â widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.  Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published.  There are many sociology-related scientific journals.
** [[Social science]]  â field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society.

===Essence of history===
* [[Chronology]] &amp;ndash; science of arranging events in their order of occurrence in time, such as in [[historical timeline]]s.
* [[Past]] &amp;ndash; totality of events which occurred before a given point in time. The past is contrasted with and defined by the present and the future. The concept of the past is derived from the linear fashion in which human observers experience time, and is accessed through memory and recollection. The past is the domain of history.
* [[Time]] &amp;ndash; measure in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future, and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions. History describes what happened where, but also when (in time) those events took place.

== Historical disciplines ==
* [[Archaeology]] â study of past human cultures through the recovery, documentation and analysis of material remains and environmental data
* [[Archontology]] â study of historical offices and important positions in state, international, political, religious and other organizations and societies
* [[Art history]] â study of changes in and social context of art
* [[Chronology]] â locating events in time
* [[Cultural history]] â study of culture in the past
* [[Diplomatic history]] â study of the historical foreign policy and diplomacy of states 
* [[History of science]] â study of the emergence and development of scientific inquiry
* [[Economic history]] â the study of economics in the past
* [[Environmental history]] â study of natural history and the human relationship with the natural world
* [[Futurology]] â study of the future: researches the medium to long-term future of societies and of the physical world
* [[Historiography]] &amp;ndash; both the study of the methodology of historians and development of history as a discipline, and also to a body of historical work on a particular subject. The historiography of a specific topic covers how historians have studied that topic using particular sources, techniques, and theoretical approaches.
* [[Intellectual history]]
* [[History painter|History painting]] â painting of works of art having historical motifs or depicting great events
* [[Military history]] â study of warfare and wars in history
* [[Naval history]] â branch of military history devoted to warfare at sea or in bodies of water
* [[Paleography]] â study of ancient texts
* [[Philosophy of history]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Political history]] â study of past political events, ideas, movements, and leaders
* [[Public history]] â presentation of history to public audiences and other areas typically outside academia
* [[Psychohistory]] â study of the psychological motivations of historical events
* [[Social history]] â study of societies and social trends in the past
* [[Universal history]] â study of trends and dynamics in world history
* [[Urban history]] â historical nature of cities and towns, and the process of urbanization
* [[Women's history]] â study of the roles of women throughout history 
* [[World history]] â study of global or transnational historical patterns

 [[File:OPGs from SBR.jpg|thumb|Oxygenic photogranules from a SBR reactor.]]
''' Oxygenic photogranules (OPGs) ''' are a type of biological aggregate with an approximately spherical form, typically from a millimeter to a centimeter scale. OPGs are characterized by the cloth-like layer of phototrophic organisms, predominantly filamentous [[ cyanobacteria ]] of the order [[Oscillatoriales]]. Oxygen production by these phototrophs through [[photosynthesis]] is typically coupled to oxygen consumption of heterotrophic biomass, releasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  that is presumably utilised in a syntrophic relationship by autotrophic phototrophs.

[[File:Cross section of a OPG.png|thumb|right|center|Cross section of a OPG  under fluorescence light]]
== Discovery/Context ==
In 2011, Park and Dolan first observed the transformation of [[activated sludge]] into oxygenic photogranule (OPG).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ Park C, Dolan S. Algal-sludge granule for wastewater treatment and bioenergy feedstock generation. Patent Cooperation Treaty WO 2015112654 A2, 2015.[https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2015112654A2/en?oq=Patent+Cooperation+Treaty+WO+2015112654+A2}}&lt;/ref&gt;, when incubated in unagitated and sealed vials exposed to natural light for several months. Since then, this static cultivation of OPG was observed with activated sludge coming from various places over the world&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Milferstedt, K., Kuo-Dahab, W.C., Butler, C.S., Hamelin, J., Abouhend, A.S., Stauch-White, K., McNair, A., Watt, C., Carbajal-GonzÃ¡lez, B.I., Dolan, S., Park, C., 2017. The importance of filamentous, motile cyanobacteria in the development of oxygenic photogranules. Sci. Reports. 7, 17944. doi:10.1038/s41598-017-16614-9 &lt;/nowiki&gt;[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-16614-9.pdf]&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in several laboratories ([http://www6.montpellier.inra.fr/narbonne_eng/Research-themes/Photogranules/],[http://cee.umass.edu/environmental-water-resources-engineering/],[http://www.mhtc.ro/national-research-development-institute-industrial-ecology/],[http://www.iingen.unam.mx/es-mx/BancodeInformacion/Entrevistas/Paginas/GermanBuitronMendez.aspx],[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dong-Hoon_Kim2]etc). &lt;br&gt;
OPGs were discovered recently and serendipitously in laboratory conditions, but very similar granules, called [[cryoconite]]s, are found in glaciers&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{ Christner, B.C., Kvitko, B.H., Reeve, J.N., 2003. Molecular identification of Bacteria and Eukarya inhabiting an Antarctic cryoconite hole. Extremophiles 7, 177â183. doi:10.1007/s00792-002-0309-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Formation of oxygenic photogranules ==
Anaerobic and aerobic granule formation are typically postulated to be driven by hydrodynamic shear and washout. Oxygenic photogranules do form when exposed to hydrodynamic shear in sequencing batch reactors&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{ Abouhend AS, McNair A, Kuo-Dahab WC, Watt C, Butler CS, Milferstedt K, Hamelin J, Seo J, Gikonyo GJ, El-Moselhy KM, Park C. 2018. The oxygenic photogranule process for aeration-free wastewater treatment. Environ. Sci. Technol., Just Accepted Manuscript â¢ DOI:10.1021/acs.est.8b00403}}&lt;/ref&gt;; however, they also form under static batch&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. They can form over the course of several weeks from a source of activated sludge exposed to light. How oxygenic photogranules form is far from understood, but filamentous and motile cyanobacteria seem to play an essential role in their formation. Cyanobacteria are enriched from the activated sludge and form the outer layer of photogranules that gives structural integrity for both photogranules generated under hydrodynamic and static conditions&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the initial presence of inorganic nitrogen in the activated sludge inoculum promotes cyanobacterial growth over microalgal growth, resulting in successful oxygenic photogranules&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Stauch-White, K., Srinivasan, V. N., Kuo-Dahab, W. C., Park, C. &amp; Butler, C. S. The role of inorganic nitrogen in successful formation of granular biofilms for wastewater treatment that support cyanobacteria and bacteria. AMB Express 7, 146 (2017). &lt;/nowiki&gt;[https://amb-express.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13568-017-0444-8]&lt;nowiki&gt;.}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
Oxygenic photogranule formation is thus not driven by hydrodynamic shear and washout are not required for the formation of oxygenic photogranules, even though these factors may play an important role when applied. Filamentous, motile cyanobacteria play a key role, but exact mechanisms have to be elucidated to be able to control the formation and properties of oxygenic photogranules and apply them to bioengineering processes.

== Oxygenic photogranules applied to wastewater treatment ==

Oxygenic photogranules is a new type of biogranules that has not been applied in bioengineering processes yet.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{ Milferstedt, K., Hamelin, J., Park, C., Jung, J., Hwang, Y., Cho, S.K., Jung, K.W., Kim, D.H., 2017. Biogranules applied in environmental engineering. Int. J. Hydrogen Energy in press. doi:10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.07.176}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has promising potentials to be applied in wastewater treatment. OPG have been applied in turbulently mixed sequencing batch reactors [[Sequencing batch reactor|SBR]] and in high rate algal pond&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{ Arcila, J.S., BuitrÃ³n, G., 2016. Microalgaeâbacteria aggregates: effect of the hydraulic retention time on the municipal wastewater treatment, biomass settleability and methane potential. J. Chem. Technol. Biotechnol. 91, 2862â2870. doi:10.1002/jctb.4901}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Oxygenic photogranules have the ability to couple [[ oxygen]] production through photosynthesis to conversion of organic matter into [[carbon dioxide]] by heterotrophs. Therefore, they have the potential to treat wastewater without external source of aeration&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{ Abouhend AS, McNair A, Kuo-Dahab WC, Watt C, Butler CS, Milferstedt K, Hamelin J, Seo J, Gikonyo GJ, El-Moselhy KM, Park C. 2018.

Technol., Just Accepted Manuscript â¢ DOI:10.1021/acs.est.8b00403}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to generate energy when this biodegradable biofeedstock is used for anaerobic digestion&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

      <comment>/* Packet filter example */ Removing 'or certifying compiler': a certifying compiler does not help in this part of the story, since it does not talk about compilation at all (it talks about machine code in the previous section)</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3319">'''Proof-carrying code''' ('''PCC''') is a software mechanism that allows a host system to verify properties about an application via a [[formal proof]] that accompanies the application's executable code.  The host system can quickly verify the validity of the proof, and it can compare the conclusions of the proof to its own [[security policy]] to determine whether the application is safe to execute.  This can be particularly useful in ensuring [[memory safety]] (i.e. preventing issues like [[buffer overflows]]).

Proof-carrying code was originally described in 1996 by [[George Necula]] and [[Peter Lee (computer scientist)|Peter Lee]].

==Packet filter example==
The original publication on proof-carrying code in 1996&lt;ref&gt;Necula, G. C. and Lee, P. 1996. Safe kernel extensions without run-time checking. SIGOPS Operating Systems Review 30, SI (Oct. 1996), 229â243.&lt;/ref&gt; used [[packet filter]]s as an example: a user-mode application hands a function written in machine code to the kernel that determines whether or not an application is interested in processing a particular network packet. Because the packet filter runs in [[kernel mode]], it could compromise the integrity of the system if it contains malicious code that writes to kernel data structures. Traditional approaches to this problem include interpreting a [[domain specific language]] for packet filtering, inserting checks on each memory access ([[software fault isolation]]), and writing the filter in a high-level language which is compiled by the kernel before it is run. These approaches all have severe performance disadvantages for code as frequently run as a packet filter.

With proof-carrying code, the kernel publishes a security policy specifying properties that any packet filter must obey: for example, will not access memory outside of the packet and its scratch memory area. A [[Automated theorem prover|theorem prover]] is used to show that the machine code satisfies this policy. The steps of this proof are recorded and attached to the machine code which is given to the kernel program loader. The program loader can then rapidly validate the proof, allowing it to thereafter run the machine code without any additional checks. If a malicious party modifies either the machine code or the proof, the resulting proof-carrying code is either invalid or harmless (still satisfies the security policy).

'''Raimon Panikkar Alemany''', also known as '''Raimundo Panikkar''' and '''Raymond Panikkar'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.lavanguardia.es/lv24h/20100826/53990452372.html|title=Biodata|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100829081848/http://www.lavanguardia.es/lv24h/20100826/53990452372.html|archivedate=2010-08-29|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; (November 2, 1918 &amp;ndash; August 26, 2010), was a Catalan [[Roman Catholic]] priest and a proponent of [[Interfaith dialogue|inter-religious dialogue]]. As a scholar, he specialized in [[comparative religion]].

==Early life and education==
Raimon Panikkar was born as the son of a Spanish [[Roman Catholic]] mother and a [[Hindu]] [[India]]n father in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{citejournal|work=Time|date=September 20, 2010|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was well-educated and from the [[Catalan people|Catalan]] bourgeoisie. His father, Ramunni Panikkar, belonged to  [[Malabar district|Malabar]] [[Nair]] family from [[South India]]. Panikkar's father was a freedom fighter during [[British Raj|British colonial rule in India]] and escaped from Britain and married into a Catalan family. Panikkar's father studied in England and was the representative of a German chemical company in Barcelona. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Educated at a [[Jesuit]] school, Panikkar studied chemistry and philosophy at the universities of [[University of Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] and [[Complutense University of Madrid|Madrid]], and Catholic Theology in Madrid and Rome. He earned a doctorate in philosophy at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]] in 1946 and a doctorate in chemistry in 1958.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{citejournal|work=The New York Times|date=September 6, 2010|page=A20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned a third doctorate in theology at the [[Pontifical Lateran University]] in Rome in 1961.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; He compared St. Thomas Aquinas's Philosophy with the eighth-century Hindu philosopher [[Adi Shankara|Ädi ÅaÅkara]]'s Interpretation of the [[Brahma Sutras]].&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

==Career==

In 1946 he was ordained a [[Catholic priest]], and became a professor of philosophy at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]].&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

He made his first trip to India in 1954 where he studied [[Indian philosophy]] and religion at the [[University of Mysore]] and [[Banaras Hindu University]], where he met several Western monks seeking Eastern forms for the expression of their Christian beliefs.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; "I left Europe [for India] as a Christian, I discovered I was a Hindu and returned as a Buddhist without ever having ceased to be Christian," he later wrote.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;

While in Jerusalem during 1962, he was summoned to Rome by Opus Dei founder and director, [[Saint]] [[JosemarÃ­a EscrivÃ¡]], who expelled him after a brief trial where he was charged with disobedience to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Raimon Panikkar |author= Raffaele Luise |id= San Paolo |place= Milan |year=2011 |pages= 25-32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 he became a visiting professor at [[Harvard Divinity School]] and a professor of religious studies at [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] in 1972.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; For many years he taught in the spring and spent the rest of the year doing research in India.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; Where the typical approach to Cross-Cultural Religious Studies, especially in a secular university, was to hold two or more traditions at arm's length and draw lines of comparison between them, Panikkar's approach was to view issues in the real world through the eyes of two or more traditions.

In 1987 he moved to [[Tavertet]] in [[Catalonia]], in the hills north of Barcelona, where he founded the Raimon Panikkar Vivarium Foundation, a center for intercultural studies.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; 
In 2005 he creates Arbor &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moneyhouse registration|url=http://www.moneyhouse.ch/en/p/panikkar_alemany_raimon-4995690/|website=Moneyhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the realization of his principle of interreligious collaboration for the relief of poverty in thousands of villages of India &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arbor Foundation India|url=https://www.arborindia.org|website=Arbor India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Panikkar authored more than 40 books and 900 articles. His complete works are being published in Italian. His 1989 [[Gifford Lectures]] were published in English by Orbis in 2009 under the title "The Rhythm of Being."

In a statement from his residence in Tavertet dated January 26, 2010, he wrote: "Dear Friends . . . I would like to communicate with you that I believe the moment has come, (put off time and again), to withdraw from all public activity, both the direct and the intellectual participation, to which I have dedicated all my life as a way of sharing my reflections.  I will continue to be close to you in a deeper way, through silence and prayer, and in the same way I would ask you to be close to me in this last period of my existence.  You have often heard me say that a person is a knot in a network of relationships; in taking my leave from you I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for having enriched me with the relationship I have had with each of you.  I am also grateful to all of those who, either in person or through association, continue working to spread my message and the sharing of my ideals, even without me.  Thankful for the gift of life which is only such if lived in communion with others: it is with this spirit that I have lived out my ministry."

'''Reading readiness''' has been defined as the point at which a person is ready to learn to read and the time during which a person transitions from being a non-reader into a reader. Other terms for reading readiness include [[early literacy]] and emergent reading.

Children begin to learn pre-reading skills at birth while they listen to the [[Speech communication|speech]] around them. In order to learn to read, a child must first have knowledge of the oral [[language]]. According to the [[Ontario]] Government (2003), the acquisition of language is natural, but the process of learning to read is not - reading must be taught. This belief contradicts basic language philosophy, which states that children learn to read while they learn to speak. The Ontario Government (2003) also believes that reading is the foundation for success, and that those children who struggle with reading in grades 1-3 are at a disadvantage in terms of academic success, compared to those children who are not struggling.

{{Reading}}

Because a child's early experience with [[literacy]]-related activities is highly correlated to the child's success with [[reading (activity)|reading]], it is important to consider a child's developmental level when choosing appropriate activities and goals. Early and enjoyable pre-reading experiences set the stage for a child's desire to learn. By participating in developmentally-appropriate activities (activities that are fun and challenging, but not frustrating), the child gains knowledge that will serve as the foundation for further learning as he or she enters the school system.

Reading readiness is highly individualistic. There is no "one size fits all" solution to teaching a child to read. A parent or educator may need to employ several techniques before finding the most appropriate method for an individual child. According to [[Vygotsky]]'s [[Zone of Proximal Development]] a child can, through the help of an adult or more capable child, perform at a higher level than he or she can independently. The process of learning to read should thus be supported by a caring and supportive individual.

==Reading readiness skills==
Skills that indicate whether a child is ready to learn to read include:&lt;ref&gt;Learning First Alliance, What Kids Should Know Before Entering First Grade,  (1998) [http://www.readingrockets.org/article/381], retrieved August 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Institute for Literacy, A Child Becomes a Reader: Birth through Preschool, 2003.  [http://www.nifl.gov/partnershipforreading/publications/pdf/low_res_child_reader_B-K.pdf] Retrieved August 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Age-appropriate oral language development and vocabulary
*Appreciation of stories and books
*Phonemic awareness (ability to distinguish and manipulate individual sounds of language)
*Understanding of basic print concepts (for example, printed text represents spoken words; spaces between words are meaningful; pages written in English are read left to right starting at the top of the page; books have a title and an author, and so on). 
*Understanding of the alphabetic principle (letters represent the sounds of language)
*Ability to distinguish shapes (visual discrimination)
*Ability to identify at least some letters of the alphabet.

==Instructional programs for reading==

'''[[Whole language|Whole Language]]:''' With this model, language is kept whole rather than segmented into fragments or skills. Within this philosophy, children are expected to learn to read and write in the same manner that they learn to talk. Reading, writing and oral language are considered to be intertwined. Some strategies according to the whole language model include encouraging the child to learn to read by "reading," and making up stories that they think go along with the pictures in the book. This model also believes that adults should allow the child to witness reading behaviors, such as holding a book properly. It is also important for adults to model these behaviors in an environment that is free from criticism (Matthews, Klassen and Walter, 1999). An early proponent of whole language reading instruction called reading a "psycholinguistic guessing game," and thus children are taught to guess words that they don't know by using context clues. Skipping unknown words is encouraged, and "inventive" spelling is also acceptable.

'''[[Phonics]]:''' This popular method focuses on the relationship between what is SEEN and HEARD.  Students learn rules for using alphabet letters (graphemes).  "Sounding-out letters" can often be confusing because many words do not follow the rulesâthe rules are inconsistent and unreliable.  However, the phonics approach is measurably MORE effective than having made NO attempt to teach language structure.

==Other reading tips==

It is suggested that by providing the children with the knowledge of [[spelling]] patterns (that is, the combination of letters that are likely to occur within the English language) that spelling and reading will become much easier for the child. It is thought that once we (as adults) really look at the rules to the English language we use everyday and have internalized within ourselves, that it will become clear that there is some order and regular patterns that we follow. Once we are aware of these patterns, we can help children begin to understand these rules that we follow on a daily basis.

==Some suggestions for reading skills==

*Read to the child.
*Have the child "read" to you. Allow the child to create their own story based on the pictures they see within the book.
*Reread stories multiple times.
*Omit words of a familiar story and allow the child to fill in the blank.
*Allow the child to experiment with words.
*Point to the words on the page as you read out loud to the child. This enables the child to understand that sentences consist of separate words.

==Influential perspectives==

The two most influential perspectives are the ''growth-readiness'' view and the ''environmentalist'' view. The growth-readiness view focuses on the internal workings of the child in order to determine readiness, while environmentalists focus on the external environment. Both internal factors such as genetics and environmental aspects such as school atmosphere can influence a childâs readiness for reading.

==Book list==

The following is a list of books that are great for young readers. They contain vital elements such as repetition and bright colors. Many of these books also encourage the child to use their imagination by filling in the blank and taking an active role in the story.

'''Rich Dad''' is a brand established by [[Robert Kiyosaki]] for a series of educational books and games about personal finance. The trademark is owned by Cashflow Technologies, a corporation established in 1997 by Robert and Kim Kiyosaki to market these books and games.

==Books and other media==
''[[Rich Dad Poor Dad]]'' was written by [[Robert Kiyosaki]] and advocates [[financial independence]] through investing, real estate, owning businesses, and the use of finance protection tactics.

Kiyosaki followed with ''Rich Dad's CASHFLOW Quadrant'' and ''Rich Dad's Guide to Investing''. 

Originally self-published before being picked up commercially, the central concept of ''Rich Dad Poor Dad'' is an anecdotal comparison of his "two fathers". His "poor dad" was his biological father, who became [[Superintendent (education)|Superintendent]] of the Hawaii State Department of Education but had very little real [[net worth]] which is contrasted with this is his  "rich dad".

==Didactic games==
Kiyosaki stresses the value of games, particularly ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', as tools for learning basic financial strategies such as "trade four green houses for one red hotel." Kiyosaki has created several games to reinforce the information in his books. 

"Cashflow 101" is a [[board game]] designed by Kiyosaki, which aims to teach the players concepts of [[investing]] and making [[money]].

There are two stages to the game. In the first, "the [[rat race]]", the player aims to raise his or her character's [[passive income]] level to where it exceeds the character's [[expense]]s through a variety of investment options. The winner is determined in the second stage, "the fast track." To win, a player must get his  character to buy his "dream" or accumulate $50,000 in monthly [[cash flow]].

The game forces the players to do the accounts by themselves. In place of "score cards", there are [[financial statements]]. Therefore, players can see more clearly what is happening with their money. It generally shows how assets generate incomes and liabilities and 'doodads' affect expenses.

Basic strategies involved in this game are: buying and selling stocks, cashflow, appreciation, and leverage.

==Controversy==
{{controversy section|date=October 2014}}
In 2010, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] investigated the Rich Dad seminars associated with Kiyosaki on their consumer advocacy program, ''[[Marketplace (Canadian TV program)|Marketplace]]''.&lt;ref name="MarketPlace"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/2010/road_to_rich_dad/main.html|title= Road to Rich Dad: Who's getting rich off Rich Dad?|author= |date= January 29, 2010|work= [[Marketplace (Canadian TV program)|Marketplace]]|publisher= [[Canadian Broadcasting Company|CBC]]|accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that one-day free seminars were conducted at which three-day courses were offered for $500. At the three-day classes, participants were offered longer courses priced between $12,000 and $45,000. A hidden camera was employed at a $500 seminar in [[Kitchener, Ontario]], showing the trainer, Marc Mousseau, advising participants to request that their credit-card be raised and giving out scripts with instructions for how to ask for limits as high as $100,000.&lt;ref name=CBC-Feb1&gt;{{cite news |title= {{-'}}Rich Dad' seminars deceptive: Marketplace|url=http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2010/01/28/consumer-rich-dad-poor-dad-marketplace.html|date= February 1, 2010|publisher= [[CBC News]]|accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show interviewed Bob Aaron,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aaron.ca/main.cfm|title= About Aaron and Aaron |publisher= Aaron and Aaron Barristers and Solicitors|accessdate=February 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a lawyer whose practice is 25% real estate law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawyerahead.ca/lawyer/view/_28/ |title=Bob Aaron |publisher=Lawyerahead.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; who said that some of Mousseau's advice was unusual and unlikely to work, such as advising that a developer might give two condos free when selling ten, getting an [[Option (finance)|option]] to buy the house at a later date and buying a house in pre-foreclosure.&lt;ref name=CBC-Feb1/&gt; The program also found a claim by the trainer to be untrue; he claimed to have been part of a deal that made $32 million on a mobile home park in Saskatchewan, but the park did not exist. The instructor was described as "overbearing, obnoxious, and rude" by an attendee, after showing video footage of his behavior.&lt;ref name="MarketPlace" /&gt;  

On August 20, 2012, one of Kiyosaki's companies, Rich Global LLC, filed for bankruptcy in Wyoming Bankruptcy Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Company Bankruptcy Information for Rich Global LLC|url=http://business-bankruptcies.com/cases/rich-global-llc|date= August 20, 2012|publisher= busbk.com|accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move followed a ruling by a U.S. District Court jury that former business partners of Kiyosaki were entitled to $23,687,957.21 of the profits from events they helped to set up for Kiyosaki including a 2002 appearance at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. A spokesman for Kiyosaki asserted that the amount of the award exceeded the value of Rich Global LLC and that Kiyosaki would not use money from outside the company to meet the judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Rich Dad, Poor Dad now a bankrupt dad: Best-selling author files for corporate bankruptcy after losing $24m judgement|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2215642/Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad-bankrupt-dad-Best-selling-author-files-corporate-bankruptcy-losing-24m-judgement.html|date= October 10, 2012|work= [[Daily Mail]]|location=London|accessdate=2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rich Dad Education==

Part of Rich Dad Education's mission is to increase financial literacy among youth. Rich Dad Educationâs CEO Anthony Humpage was interviewed by Business Insider&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kane|first1=Libby|title=6 Money Lessons You Should Have Learned Before College|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-teens-should-know-about-money-college-2014-7|publisher=Business Insider|date=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in July 2014 for teaching the lessons that college bound teens need to know about financial independence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8525">'''Seven stages of action''' is a term coined by the [[usability]] consultant [[Donald Norman]]. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Action Cycle.JPG|thumb|right|400px|Action Cycle as described by [[Donald Norman]]. {{deletable image-caption}}]]  --&gt;He explains this phrase in chapter two of his book ''[[The Design of Everyday Things]]'', in the context of explaining the psychology of a person behind the task performed by him or her.

== Building up the Stages ==
=== History ===
The history behind the action cycle starts from a conference in [[Italy]] attended by Donald Norman.
This excerpt has been taken from the book ''[[The Design of Everyday Things]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am in Italy at a conference. I watch the next speaker attempt to thread a film onto a projector that he never used before. He puts the reel into place, then takes it off and reverses it. Another person comes to help. Jointly they thread the film through the projector and hold the free end, discussing how to put it on the takeup reel. Two more people come over to help and then another. The voices grow louder, in three languages: Italian, German and English. One person investigates the controls, manipulating each and announcing the result. Confusion mounts. I can no longer observe all that is happening. The conference organizer comes over. After a few moments he turns and faces the audience, who had been waiting patiently in the auditorium. "Ahem," he says, "is anybody expert in projectors?" Finally, fourteen minutes after the speaker had started to thread the film (and eight minutes after the scheduled start of the session) a blue-coated technician appears. He scowls, then promptly takes the entire film off the projector, rethreads it, and gets it working.&lt;ref name="ch2"&gt;[[Donald Norman|Norman, Donald A.]], "Psychology of Everyday Action". ''[[The Design of Everyday Things]]''. New York: Basic Book, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|45â46}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Norman pondered on the reasons that made something like threading of a projector difficult to do. To examine this, he wanted to know what happened when something implied nothing. In order to do that, he examined the structure of an action. So to get something done, a notion of what is wanted â the goal that is to be achieved, needs to be started. Then, something is done to the world i.e. take action to move oneself or manipulate someone or something. Finally, the checking is required if the goal was made. This led to formulation of Stages of Execution and Evaluation.&lt;ref name="ch2" /&gt;{{rp|46}}

=== Stages of Execution ===
''Execution'' formally means to perform or do something. Norman explains that a person sitting on an armchair while reading a book at dusk, might need more light when it becomes dimmer and dimmer. To do that, he needs to switch on the button of a lamp i.e. get more light (the [[goal]]). To do this, one must need to specify on how to move one's body, how to stretch to reach the light switch and how to extend one's finger to push the button. The goal has to be translated into an intention, which in turn has to be made into an action sequence.

Thus, formulation of stages of execution:
* Start at the top with the ''goal'', the state that is to be achieved.
* The goal is translated into an ''[[intention]]'' to do some action.
* The intention must be translated into a set of internal commands, an ''action sequence'' that can be performed to satisfy the intention.
* The action sequence is still a mutual event: nothing happens until it is ''executed'', performed upon the world.

=== Stages of Evaluation ===
''[[Evaluation]]'' formally means to examine and calculate. Norman explains that after turning on the light, we evaluate if it is actually turned on. A careful judgement is then passed on how the light has affected our world i.e. the room in which the person is sitting on the armchair while reading a book.

The formulation of the stages of evaluation can be described as:
* Evaluation starts with our ''[[perception]]'' of the world.
* This perception must then be ''interpreted'' according to our expectations.
* Then it is compared ''(evaluated)'' with respect to both our intentions and our goals.

=== Seven Stages of Action ===

'''Seven Stages of Action''' constitute four stages of execution, three stages of evaluation and our goals.

1. Forming the goal

2. Forming the intention

3. Specifying an action

4. Executing the action

5. Perceiving the state of the world

6. Interpreting the state of the world

7. Evaluating the outcome [http://cmapspublic.ihmc.us/servlet/SBReadResourceServlet?rid=1165167923187_663887047_11513&amp;partName=htmltext]

== The Gulfs  ==
=== The Gulf of Execution ===
The difference between the intentions and the allowable actions is the ''[[Gulf of execution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, Ted. "Lecture on Cognition and Perception". ''User Interface Design''. Simon Fraser University. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Consider the movie projector example: one problem resulted from the Gulf of Execution. The person wanted to set up the projector. Ideally, this would be a simple thing to do. But no, a long, complex sequence was required. It wasn't all clear what actions had to be done to accomplish the intentions of setting up the projector and showing the film."&lt;ref name="ch2" /&gt;{{rp|51}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The Gulf of Evaluation ===
The ''[[Gulf of evaluation]]'' reflects the amount of effort that the person must exert to interpret the physical state of the system and to determine how well the expectations and intentions have been met.&lt;ref&gt;Hearst, Marti. "Lecture on Gulf of Evaluation". ''User Interface Design and Development''. University of California at Berkeley. 1999. &lt;http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/courses/is213/s99/Lectures/Lecture10/sld010.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In the movie projector example there was also a problem with the Gulf of Evaluation. Even when the film was in the projector, it was difficult to tell if it had been threaded correctly."&lt;ref name="ch2" /&gt;{{rp|51â52}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Usage as Design Aids ==
The seven-stage structure is referenced as design aid to act as a basic checklist for designers' &lt;ref&gt;Gore, Elizabeth. "III: Donald Norman: Seven Stages of Action. ''Web Site Analysis'', University of Illinois at Chicago. 2004. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://bethgore.com/Beth%20Gore%20Home%20Page/documents/Web%20Site%20Analysis%20-%20UIC.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707230442/http://bethgore.com/Beth%20Gore%20Home%20Page/documents/Web%20Site%20Analysis%20-%20UIC.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; questions to ensure that the Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation are bridged.&lt;ref name="ch2" /&gt;{{rp|52â53}}

The Seven Stages of Action can be broken down into 4 main principles of good design:
* ''[[Visibility]]'' - By looking, the user can tell the state of the device and the alternatives for action.
* ''A Good Conceptual Model'' - The designer provides a good conceptual model for the user, with consistency in the presentation of operations and results and a coherent, consistent system image.
* ''Good mappings'' - It is possible to determine the relationships between actions and results, between the controls and their effects, and between the system state and what is visible.
* ''[[Feedback]]'' - The user receives full and continuous feedback about the results of the actions.

&lt;!-- [[File:sonicbm2.ogg|thumb|right|250px|Aircraft sonic boom. {{deletable image-caption|Monday, 21 December 2009}}]] --&gt;
A '''sonic boom''' is the sound associated with the [[shock wave]]s created whenever an object travelling through the air travels faster than the [[speed of sound]]. Sonic booms generate enormous amounts of [[sound]] energy, sounding similar to an [[explosion]] or a [[thunder]]clap to the human ear. The crack of a supersonic [[bullet]] passing overhead or the crack of a [[bullwhip]] are examples of a sonic boom in miniature.&lt;ref name="americanscientist.org"&gt;[http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2002/9/crackin-good-mathematics Mike May, ''Crackin' Good Mathematics'', American Scientist, Volume 90, Number 5, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sonic booms due to large supersonic aircraft can be particularly loud and startling, tend to awaken people, and may cause minor damage to some structures. They led to prohibition of routine supersonic flight over land. Although they cannot be completely prevented, research suggests that with careful shaping of the vehicle the nuisance due to them may be reduced to the point that overland supersonic flight may become a practical option.

A sonic boom does not occur only at the moment an object crosses the speed of sound; and neither is it heard in all directions emanating from the speeding object. Rather the boom is a continuous effect that occurs while the object is travelling at supersonic speeds. But it only affects observers that are positioned at a point that intersects a region in the shape of a geometrical cone behind the object. As the object moves, this conical region also moves behind it and when the cone passes over the observer, they will briefly experience the ''boom''.

==Causes==
When an aircraft passes through the air it creates a series of [[P-wave|pressure waves]] in front of the aircraft and behind it, similar to the [[Bow wave|bow and stern waves]] created by a boat. These waves travel at the [[speed of sound]] and, as the speed of the object increases, the waves are forced together, or compressed, because they cannot get out of each other's way quickly enough. Eventually they merge into a single shock wave, which travels at the speed of sound, a critical speed known as ''Mach 1'', and is approximately {{convert|1235|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} at sea level and {{convert|20|C|F}}.

In smooth flight, the shock wave starts at the nose of the aircraft and ends at the tail.  Because the different radial directions around the aircraft's direction of travel are equivalent (given the "smooth flight" condition), the shock wave forms a ''Mach cone'', similar to a [[vapour cone]], with the aircraft at its tip.  The half-angle between direction of flight and the shock wave &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin( \alpha) =\frac{v_\text{sound}}{v_\text{object}} &lt;/math&gt;,

where  &lt;math&gt; \frac{v_\text{sound}}{v_\text{object}} &lt;/math&gt; is the inverse &lt;math&gt;\Big(\frac{1}{Ma}\Big)&lt;/math&gt; of the plane's [[Mach number]] (&lt;math&gt;Ma = \frac{v_\text{object}}{v_\text{sound}}&lt;/math&gt;).  Thus the faster the plane travels, the finer and more pointed the cone is.

There is a rise in pressure at the nose, decreasing steadily to a negative pressure at the tail, followed by a sudden return to normal pressure after the object passes. This "[[overpressure]] profile" is known as an N-wave because of its shape. The "boom" is experienced when there is a sudden change in pressure; therefore, an N-wave causes two booms â one when the initial pressure-rise reaches an observer, and another when the pressure returns to normal. This leads to a distinctive "double boom" from a supersonic aircraft. When the aircraft is maneuvering, the pressure distribution changes into different forms, with a characteristic U-wave shape.

Since the boom is being generated continually as long as the aircraft is supersonic, it fills out a narrow path on the ground following the aircraft's flight path, a bit like an unrolling [[red carpet]], and hence known as the ''boom carpet''.  Its width depends on the altitude of the aircraft. The distance from the point on the ground where the boom is heard to the aircraft depends on its altitude and the angle &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt;.

For today's supersonic aircraft in normal operating conditions, the peak overpressure varies from less than 50 to 500 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] (1 to 10 psf (pound per square foot)) for an N-wave boom. Peak [[overpressure]]s for U-waves are amplified two to five times the N-wave, but this amplified overpressure impacts only a very small area when compared to the area exposed to the rest of the sonic boom. The strongest sonic boom ever recorded was 7,000 Pa (144 psf) and it did not cause injury to the researchers who were exposed to it. The boom was produced by an [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4]] flying just above the speed of sound at an altitude of {{convert|100|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc01/professional/papers/pap284/p284.htm Analyzing Sonic Boom Footprints of Military Jets, Andy S. Rogers, A.O.T, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; In recent tests, the maximum boom measured during more realistic flight conditions was 1,010 Pa (21 psf). There is a probability that some damage â shattered glass, for example â will result from a sonic boom. Buildings in good condition should suffer no damage by pressures of 530 Pa (11 psf) or less. And, typically, community exposure to sonic boom is below 100 Pa (2 psf). Ground motion resulting from sonic boom is rare and is well below structural damage thresholds accepted by the [[U.S. Bureau of Mines]] and other agencies.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet"&gt;USAF Fact Sheet 96-03, Armstrong Laboratory, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

The power, or volume, of the shock wave depends on the quantity of air that is being accelerated, and thus the size and shape of the aircraft. As the aircraft increases speed the shock cone gets ''tighter'' around the craft and becomes weaker to the point that at very high speeds and altitudes no boom is heard.  The "length" of the boom from front to back depends on the length of the aircraft to a power of 3/2. Longer aircraft therefore "spread out" their booms more than smaller ones, which leads to a less powerful boom.&lt;ref name=seebass&gt;[ftp://ftp.rta.nato.int/PubFulltext/RTO/EN/RTO-EN-004/$EN-004-06.pdf Sonic Boom Minimization Richard Seebass]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several smaller shock waves can and usually do form at other points on the aircraft, primarily at any convex points, or curves, the leading wing edge, and especially the inlet to engines. These secondary shockwaves are caused by the air being forced to turn around these convex points, which generates a shock wave in [[Supersonic speed|supersonic flow]].

The later shock waves are somewhat faster than the first one, travel faster and add to the main shockwave at some distance away from the aircraft to create a much more defined N-wave shape. This maximizes both the magnitude and the "rise time" of the shock which makes the boom seem louder. On most aircraft designs the characteristic distance is about {{convert|40000|ft|m|sigfig=2}}, meaning that below this altitude the sonic boom will be "softer". However, the drag at this altitude or below makes supersonic travel particularly inefficient, which poses a serious problem.

==Measurement and examples==
The [[pressure]] from sonic booms caused by aircraft often are a few pounds per square foot. A vehicle flying at greater altitude will generate lower pressures on the ground, because the shock wave reduces in intensity as it spreads out away from the vehicle, but the sonic booms are less affected by vehicle speed.

==Abatement==
[[File:Large-Scale Low-Boom Supersonic Inlet Model.jpg|thumb|New research is being performed at NASA's [[Glenn Research Center]] that could help alleviate the sonic boom produced by supersonic aircraft. Testing was recently completed of a Large-Scale Low-Boom supersonic inlet model with micro-array flow control. A NASA aerospace engineer is pictured here in a wind tunnel with the Large-Scale Low-Boom supersonic inlet model.]]

In the late 1950s when [[supersonic transport]] (SST) designs were being actively pursued, it was thought that although the boom would be very large, the problems could be avoided by flying higher. This assumption was proven false when the [[North American B-70]] ''Valkyrie'' started flying, and it was found that the boom was a problem even at 70,000 feet (21,000&amp;nbsp;m). It was during these tests that the N-wave was first characterized.

Richard Seebass and his colleague Albert George at [[Cornell University]] studied the problem extensively and eventually defined a "[[figure of merit]]" (FM) to characterize the sonic boom levels of different aircraft. FM is a function of the aircraft weight and the aircraft length. The lower this value, the less boom the aircraft generates, with figures of about 1 or lower being considered acceptable. Using this calculation, they found FMs of about 1.4 for [[Concorde]] and 1.9 for the [[Boeing 2707]]. This eventually doomed most SST projects as public resentment mixed with politics eventually resulted in laws that made any such aircraft impractical (flying supersonically only over water for instance). Another way to express this is [[wing span]]. The [[fuselage]] of even a large supersonic aircraft is very sleek and with enough angle of attack and wing span the plane can fly so high that the boom by the fuselage is not important. The larger the wing span, the greater the downwards impulse which can be applied to the air, the greater the boom felt. A smaller wing span favors small aeroplane designs like [[business jets]].&lt;ref name=seebass/&gt;

Seebass and George also worked on the problem from a different angle, trying to spread out the N-wave laterally and temporally (longitudinally), by producing a strong and downwards-focused ([[SR-71 Blackbird]], [[Boeing X-43]]) shock at a sharp, but wide angle nosecone, which will travel at slightly supersonic speed ([[Shock wave|bow shock]]), and using a swept back [[flying wing]] or an [[Oblique wing|oblique flying wing]] to smooth out this shock along the direction of flight (the tail of the shock travels at sonic speed). To adapt this principle to existing planes, which generate a shock at their [[nose cone]] and an even stronger one at their wing leading edge, the fuselage below the wing is shaped according to the [[area rule]]. Ideally this would raise the characteristic altitude from {{convert|40000|ft|m}} to 60,000 feet (from 12,000&amp;nbsp;m to 18,000&amp;nbsp;m), which is where most SST aircraft were expected to fly.&lt;ref name=seebass/&gt;

[[File:Northrop F-5E (modified) DARPA sonic tests 04.07R.jpg|thumb|NASA F-5E modified for DARPA sonic boom tests]]
This remained untested for decades, until [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] started the [[Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration|Quiet Supersonic Platform]] project and funded the [[Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration]] (SSBD) aircraft to test it. SSBD used an [[F-5 Freedom Fighter]].  The F-5E was modified with a highly refined shape which lengthened the nose to that of the F-5F model.  The [[aircraft fairing|fairing]] extended from the nose all the way back to the inlets on the underside of the aircraft.  The SSBD was tested over a two-year period culminating in 21 flights and was an extensive study on sonic boom characteristics. After measuring the 1,300 recordings, some taken inside the shock wave by a [[chase plane]], the SSBD demonstrated a reduction in boom by about one-third. Although one-third is not a huge reduction, it could have reduced Concorde's boom to an acceptable level; one below the FM&amp;nbsp;= 1 limit stated above, for instance.

As a follow-on to SSBD, in 2006 a [[NASA]]-[[Gulfstream Aerospace]] team tested the [[Quiet Spike]] on NASA-Dryden's F-15B aircraft 836.  The [[Quiet Spike]] is a telescoping boom fitted to the nose of an aircraft specifically designed to weaken the strength of the shock waves forming on the nose of the aircraft at supersonic speeds. Over 50 test flights were performed.  Several flights included probing of the shockwaves by a second F-15B, NASA's [[Intelligent Flight Control System]] testbed, aircraft 837.

There are theoretical designs that do not appear to create sonic booms at all, such as the [[Busemann's Biplane]]. However, creating a shockwave is inescapable if they generate aerodynamic lift.&lt;ref name=seebass/&gt;

NASA and [[Lockheed Martin]] Aeronautics Co. are working together to build an experimental aircraft called the [[Low Boom Flight Demonstrator]] (LBFD), which will reduce the sonic boom synonymous with high-speed flight to the sound of a car door closing. The agency has awarded a $247.5 million contract to construct a working version of the sleek, single-pilot plane by summer 2021 and should begin testing over the following years to determine whether the design could eventually be adapted to commercial aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

==Perception, noise and other concerns==
The sound of a sonic boom depends largely on the distance between the observer and the aircraft shape producing the sonic boom. A sonic boom is usually heard as a deep double "boom" as the aircraft is usually some distance away. However, as those who have witnessed landings of [[space shuttle]]s have heard, when the aircraft is nearby the sonic boom is a sharper "bang" or "crack". The sound is much like that of [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar bombs]], commonly used in [[firework display]]s. It is a common misconception that only one boom is generated during the subsonic to supersonic transition; rather, the boom is continuous along the boom carpet for the entire supersonic flight. As a former Concorde pilot puts it, "You don't actually hear anything on board. All we see is the pressure wave moving down the aeroplane - it gives an indication on the instruments. And that's what we see around Mach 1. But we don't hear the sonic boom or anything like that. That's rather like the wake of a ship - it's behind us.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/3207470.stm BBC News interview with former Concorde Pilot (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, NASA and the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] began the [[Oklahoma City sonic boom tests]], which caused eight sonic booms per day over a period of six months. Valuable data was gathered from the experiment, but 15,000 complaints were generated and ultimately entangled the government in a [[class action]] lawsuit, which it lost on appeal in 1969.

Sonic booms were also a nuisance in North Cornwall and North Devon in the UK as these areas were underneath the flight path of Concorde. Windows would rattle and in some cases the "torching" (pointing underneath roof slates) would be dislodged with the vibration.

There has been recent work in this area, notably under DARPA's Quiet Supersonic Platform studies.  Research by acoustics experts under this program began looking more closely at the composition of sonic booms, including the frequency content.  Several characteristics of the traditional sonic boom "N" wave can influence how loud and irritating it can be perceived by listeners on the ground.  Even strong N-waves such as those generated by Concorde or military aircraft can be far less objectionable if the rise time of the overpressure is sufficiently long.  A new metric has emerged, known as ''perceived'' loudness, measured in PLdB.  This takes into account the frequency content, rise time, etc.  A well-known example is the snapping of one's fingers in which the "perceived" sound is nothing more than an annoyance.

The energy range of sonic boom is concentrated in the 0.1â100 [[hertz]] [[frequency range]] that is considerably below that of subsonic aircraft, [[Gunshot|gunfire]] and most [[industrial noise]]. Duration of sonic boom is brief; less than a second, 100 milliseconds (0.1 second) for most fighter-sized aircraft and 500 milliseconds for the space shuttle or Concorde jetliner. The intensity and width of a sonic boom path depends on the physical characteristics of the aircraft and how it is operated. In general, the greater an aircraft's altitude, the lower the overpressure on the ground. Greater altitude also increases the boom's lateral spread, exposing a wider area to the boom. Overpressures in the sonic boom impact area, however, will not be uniform. Boom intensity is greatest directly under the flight path, progressively weakening with greater horizontal distance away from the aircraft flight track.  Ground width of the boom exposure area is approximately {{convert|1|smi|km}} for each {{convert|1000|ft|m}} of altitude (the width is about five times the altitude); that is, an aircraft flying supersonic at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} will create a lateral boom spread of about {{convert|30|mi|km}}. For steady supersonic flight, the boom is described as a carpet boom since it moves with the aircraft as it maintains supersonic speed and altitude. Some manoeuvers, diving, acceleration or turning, can cause focusing of the boom. Other manoeuvers, such as deceleration and climbing, can reduce the strength of the shock. In some instances weather conditions can distort sonic booms.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt;

Depending on the aircraft's altitude, sonic booms reach the ground two to 60 seconds after flyover. However, not all booms are heard at ground level. The speed of sound at any altitude is a function of air temperature. A decrease or increase in temperature results in a corresponding decrease or increase in sound speed. Under standard atmospheric conditions, air temperature decreases with increased altitude. For example, when sea-level temperature is 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15&amp;nbsp;Â°C), the temperature at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} drops to minus 49 degrees Fahrenheit (â45&amp;nbsp;Â°C). This temperature gradient helps bend the sound waves upward. Therefore, for a boom to reach the ground, the aircraft speed relative to the ground must be greater than the speed of sound at the ground. For example, the speed of sound at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} is about {{convert|670|mph|km/h}}, but an aircraft must travel at least {{convert|750|mph|km/h}} (Mach 1.12, where Mach 1 equals the speed of sound) for a boom to be heard on the ground.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt;

The composition of the atmosphere is also a factor.  Temperature variations, [[humidity]], [[atmospheric pollution]], and [[wind]]s can all have an effect on how a sonic boom is perceived on the ground.  Even the ground itself can influence the sound of a sonic boom.  Hard surfaces such as [[concrete]], [[Road surface|pavement]], and large buildings can cause reflections which may amplify the sound of a sonic boom.  Similarly [[grass]]y fields and lots of [[foliage]] can help attenuate the strength of the overpressure of a sonic boom.

Currently there are no industry accepted standards for the acceptability of a sonic boom.  Until such metrics can be established, either through further study or supersonic overflight testing, it is doubtful that legislation will be enacted to remove the current prohibition on supersonic overflight in place in several countries, including the United States.

==Bullwhip==
[[File:Bullwhip.jpg|right|thumb|150px|An Australian bullwhip.]]
The cracking sound a [[bullwhip]] makes when properly wielded is, in fact, a small sonic boom. The end of the whip, known as the ''"cracker"'', moves faster than the speed of sound, thus creating a sonic boom.&lt;ref name="americanscientist.org"/&gt; The whip is probably the first human invention to break the [[sound barrier]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

A bullwhip tapers down from the handle section to the cracker. The cracker has much less mass than the handle section. When the whip is sharply swung, the energy is transferred down the length of the tapering whip.  Goriely and McMillen showed that the physical explanation is complex, involving the way that a loop travels down a tapered filament under tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Alain Goriely and Tyler McMillen | title = Shape of a Cracking Whip | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 88 | issue = 12 | year = 2002 | pages = 244301-1â244301-4 | url = http://www.e-kaczor.net/keiko/whip.pdf|doi=10.1103/physrevlett.88.244301 |bibcode = 2002PhRvL..88x4301G | pmid=12059302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological classification]], the term '''subspecies''' refers to a unity of populations of a [[species]] living in a subdivision of the species' global range and varies  from other populations of the same species by [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mayr, E. |year=1982 |title=Of what use are subspecies? |journal=The Auk |issue=99 (3) |pages=593â595}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Monroe, B. L. |year=1982 |title=A modern concept of the subspecies |journal=The Auk |issue=99 (3) |pages=608â609}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A subspecies cannot be recognized independently. A species is either recognized as having no subspecies at all or at least two, including any that are extinct. The term is abbreviated '''subsp.''' in [[botany]] and [[bacteriology]], or '''ssp.''' in [[zoology]]. The [[plural]] is the same as the singular: ''subspecies''.

In [[zoology]], under the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]], the subspecies is the only taxonomic rank below that of species that can receive a name. In [[botany]] and [[mycology]], under the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]], other [[infraspecific name|infraspecific ranks]], such as [[variety (botany)|variety]], may be named. In [[bacteriology]] and [[virology]], under standard [[International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes|bacterial nomenclature]] and [[virus classification|virus nomenclature]], there are recommendations but not strict requirements for recognizing other important infraspecific ranks.

A taxonomist decides whether to recognize a subspecies or not. A common criterion for a subspecies is its ability of [[interbreeding]] with a different subspecies of the same species and producing fertile offspring. In the wild, subspecies do not interbreed due to their [[Allopatric speciation|geographic isolation]] and [[sexual selection]]. The differences between subspecies are usually less distinct than the differences between species.

==Nomenclature==
In [[zoology]], the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' (4th edition, 1999) accepts only one rank below that of species, namely the rank of subspecies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp "Index"]. ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]''. Fourth Edition. [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]. January 1, 2000. Retrieved January 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Other groupings, "[[infrasubspecific]] entities" do not have names regulated by the ''ICZN''. Such forms have no official ''ICZN'' status, though they may be useful in describing altitudinal or geographical [[Cline (biology)|clines]], [[pet]] [[breed]]s, [[Transgenic animals#Transgenic animals|transgenic animals]], etc. While the scientific name of a species is a [[Binomial nomenclature|binomen]], the scientific name of a subspecies is a [[trinomen]] - a binomen followed by a subspecific name. A [[tiger]]'s binomen is ''Panthera tigris'', so for a [[Sumatran tiger]] the trinomen is, for example, ''Panthera tigris sumatrae''.  ''Subspecies'' is generally abbreviated as "ssp." in zoology, but is not used in scientific name.

In [[botany]], subspecies is one of many ranks below that of species, such as [[Variety (botany)|variety]], [[subvariety]], [[form (botany)|form]], and subform. The subspecific name is preceded by "subsp.", as in ''Schoenoplectus californicus'' subsp. ''[[Totora (plant)|tatora]]''. A botanical name consists of at most three parts. An [[Infraspecific name (botany)|infraspecific name]] includes the species binomial, and one infraspecific epithet, such as subspecies or variety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Mallet |title=Subspecies, semispecies, superspecies |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Sp/Sub-semi.pdf |website=ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Microbiology|bacteriology]], the only rank below species that is regulated explicitly by the code of nomenclature is ''subspecies'', but infrasubspecific taxa are extremely important in bacteriology; Appendix 10 of the code lays out some recommendations that are intended to encourage uniformity in describing such taxa. Names published before 1992 in the rank of ''variety'' are taken to be names of subspecies&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=icnb&amp;part=A185 "Chapter 3: Rules of Nomenclature with Recommendations"]. [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]]. Retrieved January 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; (see ''[[International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes]]'').  As in botany, ''subspecies'' is conventionally abbreviated as "subsp.", and is used in the scientific name: ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' subsp. ''spizizenii''.&lt;ref name="ICNP 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |at="Names of Subspecies: Rule 13a"&lt;!--This document is not page-numbered.--&gt; |title=International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (2008 Revision) |date=20 November 2015 |orig-year=2008 |journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology |edition=ICSP Matters |volume=|issue=&lt;!--Appears to have been a special stand-alone issue; no vol./issue numbers specified.--&gt; |first1=Charles T. |last1=Parker |first2=Brian J. |last2=Tindall |first3=George M. |last3=Garrity |doi=10.1099/ijsem.0.000778|pmid=26596770 }} Full text available from PDF link at this page; direct URL to PDF is auto-generated and expires.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nominotypical subspecies, and subspecies autonyms===
{{anchor|Nominate subspecies|Autonymous subspecies|Nominotypical subspecies and subspecies autonyms|reason=previous section names, and term anchors}}
In [[zoological nomenclature]], when a species is split into subspecies, the originally described population is retained as the "nominotypical subspecies"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?nfv=true&amp;article=47 International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Art. 47]&lt;/ref&gt; or "nominate subspecies", which repeats the same name as the species. For example, ''Motacilla alba alba'' (often abbreviated ''M. a. alba'') is the nominotypical subspecies of the [[white wagtail]] (''Motacilla alba'').

The subspecies name that repeats the species name is referred to in [[botanical nomenclature]] as the subspecies "[[Autonym (botany)|autonym]]", and the subspecific taxon as the "autonymous subspecies".&lt;ref name=ICN&gt;{{cite book |last1=McNeill |first1=J. |last2=Barrie |first2=F. R. |last3=Buck |first3=W. R. |last4=Demoulin |first4=V. |last5=Greuter |first5=W. |last6=Hawksworth |first6=D. L. |last7=Herendeen |first7=P.

===Doubtful cases===
When zoologists disagree over whether a certain population is a subspecies or a full species, the species name may be written in parentheses. Thus ''Larus (argentatus) smithsonianus'' means the [[American herring gull]]; the notation within the parentheses means that some consider it a subspecies of a larger [[European herring gull|herring gull]] species and therefore call it ''Larus argentatus smithsonianus'', while others consider it a full species and therefore call it ''Larus smithsonianus'' (and the user of the notation is not taking a position).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Criteria==
A subspecies is a taxonomic rank below species â the only recognized rank in the zoological code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature |title=ICZN Glossary |publisher=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |editor1-first=Gary |editor1-last=Rosenberg |display-editors=etal |url= http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?booksection=glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of three main ranks below species in the botanical code.&lt;ref name=ICN/&gt; When geographically separate populations of a species exhibit recognizable [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] differences, biologists may identify these as separate subspecies; a subspecies is a recognized local variant of a species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Peter J. |last1=Russell |first2=Paul E. |last2=Hertz |first3=Beverly |last3=McMillan |title=Biology: The Dynamic Science |publisher=Brooks/Cole California |date=2011 |chapter=21: Speciation |page=456 |isbn=978-1133418849 |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jSw9AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Botanists and mycologists have the choice of ranks lower than subspecies, such as variety (varietas) or form (forma), to recognize smaller differences between populations.&lt;ref name=ICN/&gt;

==Monotypic and polytypic species==
[[File:One horned Rhino.jpg|thumb|The [[Indian rhinoceros]] (''Rhinoceros unicornis'') is a [[monotypic]] species]]
In biological terms, rather than in relation to nomenclature, a ''[[Polytypic taxon|polytypic]]'' species has two or more genetically and phenotypically divergent subspecies, [[Race (biology)|races]], or more generally speaking, [[population]]s that need a separate description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mayr, E. |author-link=Mayr, Ernst |title=Populations, Species, and Evolution: An Abridgment of Animal Species and Evolution |year=1970 |publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are separate groups that are clearly distinct from one another and do not generally interbreed, although there may be a relatively narrow hybridization zone, but which may interbreed if given the chance to do so. These subspecies, races, or populations, can be named as subspecies by zoologists, or in more varied ways by botanists and microbiologists.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

A ''[[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]]'' species has no distinct population or races, or rather one race comprising the whole species. A taxonomist would not name a subspecies within such a species. Monotypic species can occur in several ways:
* All members of the species are very similar and cannot be sensibly divided into biologically significant subcategories.
* The individuals vary considerably, but the variation is essentially random and largely meaningless so far as genetic transmission of these variations is concerned.
* The variation among individuals is noticeable and follows a pattern, but there are no clear dividing lines among separate groups: they fade imperceptibly into one another. Such [[Cline (biology)|clinal]] variation always indicates substantial [[gene flow]] among the apparently separate groups that make up the population(s). Populations that have a steady, substantial gene flow among them are likely to represent a monotypic species, even when a fair degree of genetic variation is obvious.

'''Theodoor Hendrik van de Velde''' (12 February 1873, [[Leeuwarden]] &amp;ndash; 27 April 1937 near [[Locarno]] in a plane crash) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[physician]] and [[gynÃ¦cologist]] who served as  director at the GynÃ¦cological Institute in [[Haarlem]]. His 1926 book ''Het volkomen huwelijk'' (''The Perfect Marriage'') made him an instant international celebrity. The book advocated knowledge and sensuality in erotic life. In [[Germany]] ''Die vollkommene Ehe'' reached its 42nd printing in 1932 in spite of the fact that it was placed on the list of forbidden books, [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. In Protestant and social democratic [[Sweden]], ''Det fullÃ¤ndade Ã¤ktenskapet'' was widely known although regarded as pornographic and unsuitable for young readers long into the 1960s.

The English translation, ''[[Ideal Marriage: Its Physiology and Technique]]'' was the best-known work on its subject for several decades, and was reprinted 46 times in the original edition, selling well over a half-million copies.

He is credited with showing in 1905 that women only ovulate once per menstrual cycle.  This contributed to the improvement of [[calendar-based methods]] of birth control, and later to the creation of other [[fertility awareness]] systems.

'''Urban archaeology''' is a sub discipline of [[archaeology]] specialising in the material past of [[town]]s and [[cities]] where long-term human habitation has often left a rich record of the past.

Humans produce waste: Large concentrations of humans produce large concentrations of waste. Kitchen waste, broken objects, and similar material all need to be disposed of. Small numbers of people can dispose of their waste locally without encouraging [[vermin]] or endangering their health. Once people began to live together in large numbers, around five thousand years ago, such methods began to become impractical. Material would be brought into these new settlements but would rarely be taken out again. {{clarify|date=November 2014}}

Up until the nineteenth century when organised rubbish disposal became widespread in urban areas people invariably threw their waste from their windows or buried it in their gardens. If their houses fell down, a common enough occurrence when planning laws were non-existent, owners would pick out what they could reuse, stamp down the remains and rebuild on the old site.

The effect of this is that even a moderately sized settlement of any antiquity is built on top of a heap of refuse and demolished buildings and is therefore raised up from its original height on a plateau of archaeology. This is most apparent in the [[Tell (archaeology)|tel]] sites of the [[Near East]] where towns that have been occupied for thousands of years are raised up many metres above the surrounding landscape.

In walled towns such as those in [[medieval]] [[Europe]] the effect of the encircling defences was to hold in the waste so that it could not slip outwards, magnifying the effect.

==Historic development==

Archaeological [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] within historic cities therefore often produces a thick [[Stratification (archeology)|stratigraphy]] dating back to the original foundation and telling the story of its history.

The [[City of London]] serves as an example, for urban excavations have been performed there since the late 1900s. These excavations, performed in populated areas of the city, revealed historical evidence of events unforeseen previously by historians. London sits on a tel, which preserves a layer of dark material, attributed to the burning of the city by [[Boudica]] in 60 AD. It was only by excavation of the urban areas that these revelations could be made, as the city has long since outgrown its borders after its rebuild, some years after the Boudican revolt.

The dense stratigraphy of such cities posed problems for the archaeologists who first excavated them. Earlier excavations were generally limited to rural areas, or towns which had been long abandoned. [[Open area excavation]] was feasible as there was plenty of space and the archaeology could often be exposed just in plan. In working cities however, space for excavation is usually limited to the size of the open plot and one layer of archaeology needs to be excavated before the next one can be exposed.

Issues such as this had appeared before, at [[Pompeii]] or at multiphase rural sites but the move towards the investigation of cities, which began in Europe following the [[Second World War]]. The trend of urban excavation in areas such as Europe, the East Coast of the United States, and other western world cities, has grown since the war. Due to the bombing of landscapes during the war, the possibility of losing evidence connected to early civilizations became realized. The idea of settlement follows a principle, that settlement is made where resources are conveniently accessed. Prosperous cities, such as Boston and London, began as settlements, and grew quickly due to the convenient access of resources. However, the fact that these cities still exist today does not dismiss the fact that, at some point in history, some other civilization had once settled there.

==Methods==

The resulting solution revolved around the method of [[single context recording]]. The practice involves drawing each feature individually in plan and then relating its position to the site grid rather than planning large areas at once. Each drawing is made on a square piece of translucent film representing a 5-metre x 5 metre grid square. The site is excavated down to the first significant layer of archaeology and features excavated and recorded as normal but also planned as single contexts. The site is then reduced to the next layer of archaeology and the process begins again. The excavation and recording can continue until natural deposits are reached. A small, deep trench known as a [[sondage]] is often excavated at first to provide a view of the entire stratigraphy at once and give an indication of the quantity of material to be excavated.

Once the work is finished, the square sheets can be overlaid onto one another to provide a picture of the site. By identifying which features cut others and using information from dateable [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefact]]s and [[ecofact]]s an archaeologist can isolate various phases of activity and show how the use of the site developed of periods of hundreds or even thousands of years. Context record sheets produced by the individual excavators provide further information on each context's nature and relationship with its neighbours. Such interpretation would be impossible using open area excavation where numerous overall site plans would soon seem inflexible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9475">'''Wind engineering''' is a subsets of [[mechanical engineering]], [[structural engineering]], [[meteorology]], and [[applied physics]] to analyze the  effects of [[wind]] in the natural and the [[built environment]] and studies the possible damage, inconvenience or benefits which may result from wind. In the field of engineering it includes strong winds, which may cause discomfort, as well as extreme winds, such as in a [[tornado]], [[hurricane]] or [[Superstorm|heavy storm]], which may cause widespread destruction. In the fields of [[wind energy]] and [[air pollution]] it also includes low and moderate winds as these are relevant to electricity production resp. dispersion of contaminants.

Wind engineering draws upon [[meteorology]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[mechanics]], [[geographic information system]]s and a number of specialist [[engineering]] disciplines including [[aerodynamics]], and [[structural dynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hewitt|first=Sam|last2=Margetts|first2=Lee|last3=Revell|first3=Alistair|date=2017-04-18|title=Building a Digital Wind Farm|journal=Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering|volume=25|issue=4|language=en|pages=1â21|doi=10.1007/s11831-017-9222-7|issn=1134-3060}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tools used include [[atmospheric model]]s, atmospheric boundary layer [[wind tunnel]]s, and [[computational fluid dynamics]] models.

Wind engineering involves, among other topics:
* Wind impact on structures (buildings, bridges, towers).
* Wind comfort near buildings.
* Effects of wind on the ventilation system in a building.
* Wind climate for wind energy.
* Air pollution near buildings.

Wind engineering may be considered by structural engineers to be closely related to [[earthquake engineering]] and [[explosion protection]].

Some sports stadiums such as [[Candlestick Park]] and [[Arthur Ashe Stadium]] are known for their strong, sometimes swirly winds, which affect the playing conditions.

==History==
Wind engineering as a separate discipline can be traced to the UK in the 1960s, when informal meetings were held at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]], the Building Research Establishment and elsewhere.

==Wind loads on buildings==
The design of buildings must account for wind loads, and these are affected by [[wind shear]].
&lt;!-- Note that although Wind loading exists, but is only a redirect back to this page. --&gt;
For engineering purposes, a power law wind-speed profile may be defined as follows:&lt;ref name=Crawley&gt;{{cite book | last = Crawley | first = Stanley | title = Steel Buildings | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-471-84298-9 | pages = 272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gupta&gt;{{cite book | last = Gupta | first = Ajaya Kumar and Peter James Moss| title = Guidelines for Design of Low-Rise Buildings Subjected to Lateral Forces | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-8493-8969-6 | pages = 49|url=http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9780849389696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ v_z = v_g \cdot \left( \frac {z} {z_g} \right)^ \frac {1} {\alpha}, 0 &lt; z &lt; z_g
&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;\ v_z&lt;/math&gt; = speed of the wind at height &lt;math&gt;\ z&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ v_g&lt;/math&gt; = gradient wind at gradient height &lt;math&gt;\ z_g &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ \alpha&lt;/math&gt; = exponential coefficient
&lt;br /&gt;
Typically, buildings are designed to resist a strong wind with a very long return period, such as 50 years or more. The design wind speed is determined from historical records using [[extreme value theory]] to predict future extreme wind speeds.

==Wind comfort==
The advent of high rise [[tower blocks]] led to concerns regarding the wind nuisance caused by these buildings to pedestrians in their vicinity.

A number of wind comfort and wind danger criteria were developed from 1971, based on different pedestrian activities such as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://sts.bwk.tue.nl/urbanphysics/pdf/2013_BAE_WD_BB_TvH_Preprint.pdf Pedestrian wind comfort around buildings: comparison of wind comfort criteria. Table 3]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sitting for a long period of time
* Sitting for a short period of time
* Strolling
* Walking fast
Other criteria classified a wind environment as completely unacceptable or dangerous.

Building geometries consisting of one and two rectangular buildings have a number of well-known effects:&lt;ref&gt;[http://sts.bwk.tue.nl/urbanphysics/pdf/2013_BAE_WD_BB_TvH_Preprint.pdf Pedestrian wind comfort around buildings: comparison of wind comfort criteria. Figure 6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkisc.org/proceedings/2006421/6_Johnny_Yu%20Wind%20Effect%20on%20Pedestrians.pdf Wind Effects On Pedestrians. Figure 3]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Corner streams, also known as corner jets, around the corners of buildings
* Through-flow, also known as a passage jet, in any passage through a building or small gap between two buildings due to pressure short-circuiting
* Vortex shedding in the wake of buildings

For more complex geometries, pedestrian wind comfort studies are required.  These can use an appropriately scaled model in a boundary layer [[wind tunnel]], or more recently there has been increased use of [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] (CFD) techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aij.or.jp/jpn/publish/cfdguide/JWEIAguide.pdf AIJ guidelines for practical applications of CFD to pedestrian wind environment around buildings]&lt;/ref&gt; The pedestrian level wind speeds for a given exceedance probability are calculated to allow for regional wind speeds statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cmff.hu/oktatas/tantargy/NEPTUN/BMEGEATMW08/2010-2011-1/ea_lecture/blocken_pedestrianWindEnvironment.pdf Pedestrian Wind Environment Around Buildings. p112]&lt;/ref&gt;

The vertical wind profile used in these studies varies according to the terrain in the vicinity of the buildings (which is may differ by wind direction), and is often grouped in categories such as:&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.resource.org/pub/nz/ibr/as-nzs.1170.2.2011.pdf AS/NZS 1170.2:2011 Structural Design Actions Part 2 â Wind actions. Section 4.2]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exposed open terrain with few or no obstructions and water surfaces at serviceability wind speeds.
* Water surfaces, open terrain, grassland with few, well-scattered obstructions having heights generally from 1.5 m to 10m.
* Terrain with numerous closely spaced obstructions 3 m to 5 m high, such as areas of suburban housing.
* Terrain with numerous large, high (10 m to 30 m high) and closely spaced obstructions, such as large city centres and well-developed industrial complexes.

==Wind turbines==

[[Wind turbine]]s are affected by wind shear. Vertical wind-speed profiles result in different wind speeds at the blades nearest to the ground level compared to those at the top of blade travel, and this in turn affects the turbine operation.&lt;ref name=Heier&gt;{{cite book | last = Heier | first = Siegfried | title = Grid Integration of Wind Energy Conversion Systems | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Chichester | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-470-86899-7 | pages = 45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wind gradient can create a large bending moment in the shaft of a two bladed turbine when the blades are vertical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Harrison | first = Robert | title = Large Wind Turbines | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Chichester | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-471-49456-0 | pages = 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduced wind gradient over water means shorter and less expensive wind turbine towers can be used in shallow seas.&lt;ref name=Lubosny&gt;{{cite book | last = Lubosny | first = Zbigniew | title = Wind Turbine Operation in Electric Power Systems: Advanced Modeling | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-3-540-40340-1 | pages = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For wind turbine engineering, wind speed variation with height is often approximated using a power law:&lt;ref name=Heier/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ v_w(h) = v_{ref} \cdot \left( \frac {h} {h_{ref}} \right)^ a
&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;\ v_w(h)&lt;/math&gt; = velocity of the wind at height &lt;math&gt; h&lt;/math&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[m/s]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ v_{ref}&lt;/math&gt; = velocity of the wind at some reference height &lt;math&gt; h_{ref} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[m/s]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ a&lt;/math&gt; = Hellman exponent (aka power law exponent or shear exponent) (~= 1/7 in neutral flow, but can be &gt;1)

==Significance==
The knowledge of wind engineering is used to analyze and design all [[high rise]] buildings, cable [[suspension bridge]]s and [[cable-stayed bridge]]s, electricity transmission towers and [[telecommunication tower]]s and all other types of towers and chimneys. The wind load is the dominant load in the analysis of many tall buildings. So wind engineering is essential for the analysis and design of tall buildings. Again, wind load is a dominant load in the analysis and design of all long-span [[cable bridge]]s.
