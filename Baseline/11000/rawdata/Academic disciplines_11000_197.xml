Muhammad bin Umar bin Abd al-Rahman bin Abd Allah al-Aqil, better known as '''Abu Abd al-Rahman Ibn Aqil al-Zahiri''', is a Saudi Arabian [[polymath]]. He has, at various times, been referred to as a [[theologian]], [[jurist]], [[historian]], [[ethnographer]], [[geographer]], [[poet]], [[critic]] and [[author]].&lt;ref name=saido&gt;Dr. Amin Sulayman Sidu,  [http://www.addiriyah.org/tahrer/index.htm Bibliography and abridged biography of Abu Abd al-Rahman Ibn Aqil al-Zahiri]. [[King Fahad National Library]] Academid Journal, vol. 3, iss. #2, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of Saudi Arabia's "Golden Generation," he knew of life both during the poverty of the pre-[[oil boom]] era and the prosperity of the 1950s onward.

==Personal life==
Ibn Aqil was born in the city of [[Shaqraa]] in Saudi Arabia's central [[Najd]] region in 1942.&lt;ref name=saido/&gt; His has been married three times, during which he sired twenty-six children. His current wife is from [[Egypt]]. Ibn Aqil also owns a bookstore, "Dar Ibn Hazm," in the [[As-Suwaidi (Riyadh)|Al-Suwaidi]] district where he currently{{year needed|date=May 2015}} lives, and is the prayer leader of a nearby [[mosque]].

Ibn Aqil had a complicated friendship and, later, rivalry with fellow Arab philosopher [[Abdullah al-Qasemi]]. Having known al-Qasemi before he converted from Islam to atheism, Ibn Aqil met al-Qasemi for a debate in the [[Garden City (Cairo)|Garden City]] district of [[Downtown Cairo]]. After a long discussion regarding the [[existence of God]] and [[Theodicy]], Ibn Aqil authored the book ''A Night in Garden City'' as an account of the debate.

==Career==
After receiving his primary and secondary education in Shaqraa, Ibn Aqil relocated to [[Riyadh]] and enrolled in [[Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University]], which at the time was a brand new institution. He earned a [[Bachelor of Science in Law]] from the college of [[Sharia|Islamic law]],&lt;ref name=who66&gt;''Who's Who in Saudi Arabia 1978-1979'', pg. 66. Part of the [[Who's Who]] series. Edited by M. Samir Sarhan. [[Jeddah]] and [[London]]: [[Tihama (company)|Tihama]] and [[Europa Publications]]. {{ISBN|0905118286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=who176&gt;''Who's Who in the Arab World 1990-1991'', pg. 176. Part of the Who's Who series. Edited by Gabriel M. Bustros. [[Beirut]]: Publitec Publications, 10th ed. {{ISBN|2903188076}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Master of Theology]] degree in [[Tafsir|exegesis]] of the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name=saido/&gt; During this time, Ibn Aqil was a student of former Saudi [[Grand Mufti]] [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz]] and [[Ibn Humaid]], another high-ranking cleric. Zahiri spent most of his tutelage under [[Abu Turab al-Zahiri]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.al-madina.com/node/198204 Abu Abd al-Rahman Ibn Aqil al-Zahiri: The Zahiri school was the fourth school before the Hanbalis existed]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. [[Al Madina (newspaper)|Al Madina]], Iss. #17340. 14 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his twenties and early thirties, Ibn Aqil worked as a lawyer within Saudi Arabia's theocratic justice system. He was eventually placed in administrative positions for public education in the country's [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|eastern province]] in [[Dammam]], and then later moved to the legal department in the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs.&lt;ref name=saido/&gt; Upon returning to Riyadh, he founded and served as president of the Riyadh Literary Society, and began writing a regular column for the Arabic daily [[Al Jazirah (newspaper)|Al Jazirah]]; while he continues the latter endeavor, he relinquished his presidency of the Society and joined the general membership. From the 1960s to the 1980s, Ibn Aqil served in several posts including that of a legal adviser to the Riyadh Municipal Agency, auditor of the General Employees Bureau and Director of Services for the General Administration of Girls' Education.&lt;ref name=who66/&gt;&lt;ref name=who176/&gt;

In the past, he was the host of "Tafsir al-Tafasir" or "exegesis of the exegeses," a religious program which was broadcast daily on the radio and weekly on television. Building on his graduate background, Ibn Aqil would systematically collect all [[List of tafsir works|major explanations]] of the Qur'an within Sunni Islam and attempt to integrate all of them, weighing the views of various theologians. Although the program was discontinued in the late 1980s, Ibn Aqil restarted his broadcasts in 2010 from where he had left off.&lt;ref&gt;Saheefah.org. [http://www.saheefah.org/2010/08/08/the-ruling-of-tafsir-and-its-categories/ The ruling of Tafsir and its Categories].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[King Faisal Foundation#King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies|King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies]] had invited Ibn Aqil to grant a symposium on the topic of comparative exegesis five years prior, likely reigniting public interest.

Currently, Ibn Aqil has mostly retired from public life. In addition to his renewed Qur'an study broadcasts, he is a member of the [[Academy of the Arabic Language in Cairo]],&lt;ref name=saido/&gt; the Arabic Language Academy at Mecca,&lt;ref name=mujamma&gt;[http://www.m-a-arabia.com/site/8626.html ÿ£ÿ®Ÿà ÿπÿ®ÿØÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ≠ŸÖŸÜ ÿßÿ®ŸÜ ÿπŸÇŸäŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ∏ÿßŸáÿ±Ÿä]. Official website of the Academy, 9 February 2015. Accessed 8 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and still serves as the editor-in-chief of an academic journal named after the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] [[Diriyah]], which he founded and which holds its headquarters on his family estate.&lt;ref name=mujamma/&gt;

==Views==
Ibn Aqil has defined the problems of Saudi society as coming both from secularists on one end of the spectrum and Muslim clerics delivering hasty and erroneous proclamations on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Sa'd al-Bahis, [http://www.okaz.com.sa/okaz/osf/20070531/Con20070531114595.htm "Abu Abd al-Rahman: Masha`ikh al-ummah mun'azilun fikriyan wa mashghulun bi-ta'lim al-furoo'."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301102709/http://www.okaz.com.sa/okaz/osf/20070531/Con20070531114595.htm |date=March 1, 2011 }} [[Okaz]]: 31 May 2007, iss. #2174.&lt;/ref&gt; Being a part of Saudi Arabia's "Golden Generation," Ibn Aqil has generally been supportive of the [[House of Saud]] and the Saudi government, and an opponent of its critics among both liberal modernists and radical extremists.

Recently, Ibn Aqil called for the Saudi government to strip a dissident journalist of his citizenship due to his sharp criticisms of the [[Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;Tariq al-Homayed, [http://arabnews.com/node/226377 "Buraidah ‚Äî a misunderstood Saudi city."] [[Arab News]], Monday, 2 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other end of the spectrum, Ibn Aqil engaged in a public series of exchanges with fellow cleric [[Abdul-Rahman al-Barrak]] in 2011 due to the former's refusal to adopt a formal position on theological issues debated during the [[Mihna]], a rare Medieval-era [[inquisition]] within Islam perpetrated by rationalists against their orthodox counterparts. Ibn Aqil has also fallen into conflict with [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] cleric [[Yusuf al-Qardawi]] in a series of back-and-forth columns, though Qardawi did not mention Ibn Aqil by name.&lt;ref&gt;Khalid al-Saif, [http://www.alsharq.net.sa/2012/10/06/521116 "This is what Ibn Aqil said about Qardawi!"] 6 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Aqil, who has expressed skepticism about the goals and results of the [[Arab Spring]], considered Qardawi's various positions during the movement hypocritical and contradictory, charges which Qardawi denied.

==Works==
Being a jurist and scholar of the [[Zahiri]]te school of law within Sunni Islam, Ibn Aqil is also the current era's primary biography of Zahirite theologian [[Ibn Hazm]], having written detailed accounts even of Ibn Hazm's individual conflicts with rival jurist [[Abu al-Walid al-Baji]].&lt;ref name=fierro&gt;[[Maribel Fierro]], "Heresy in al-Andalus." Taken from ''The Legacy of Muslim Spain,'' pg. 905. Ed. [[Salma Jayyusi]]. [[Leiden]]: [[Brill Publishers]], 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; His bookstore is named after the Andalusian author, and Ibn Aqil has authored a number of books on the life and career of Ibn Hazm. The largest of these books is ''Nawadir al-Imam Ibn Hazm'', a collection of Ibn Hazm's smaller, harder-to-find works, such as his poem on the fundamental principles of Zahirite law.&lt;ref&gt;Jose Miguel Puerta Vilchez, "Inventory of Ibn Hazm's Works." Taken from ''Ibn ?azm of Cordoba: The Life and Works of a Controversial Thinker'', pg. 733. Eds. Camilla Adang, Maribel Fierro and [[Sabine Schmidtke]]. Volume 103 of Handbook of Oriental Studies. Section 1 The Near and Middle East. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2012. {{ISBN|9789004234246}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also delivered a lecture explaining [[Ibn Rushd]]'s attempts to reconcile philosophy and religion at the International Averroes Symposium, co-sponsored by UNESCO in [[Carthage]] between February 16 and 22 in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Majid Fakhry, [http://i-epistemology.net/attachments/626_V15N2%20Summer%2098%20-%20Conference%20Report%20-%20Celebrating%20Ibn%20Rushds%20Eight-Hundredth%20Anniversary.pdf "Celebrating Ibn Rushd's Eight-Hundredth Anniversary,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928114659/http://i-epistemology.net/attachments/626_V15N2%20Summer%2098%20-%20Conference%20Report%20-%20Celebrating%20Ibn%20Rushds%20Eight-Hundredth%20Anniversary.pdf |date=2013-09-28 }} pg. 168. The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences, vol. 15, iss. 2, pgs. 167-169. Conference report.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to ''A Night in Garden City'', other titles of some note are ''[[Descartes]] Between Scepticism and Certainty'' and ''The History of Najd During the Colloquial Epoch''.&lt;ref name=who66/&gt;&lt;ref name=who176/&gt; Perhaps stemming from his philosophical debates with al-Qasemi, reconciliation between reason and revelation has been a recurring theme in Ibn Aqil's work.

[[File:Rooftop Packaged Units.JPG|thumb|270px|A rooftop packaged unit or RTU]]
An '''air handler''', or '''air handling unit''' (often abbreviated to '''AHU'''), is a device used to regulate and circulate air as part of a heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning ([[HVAC]]) system.&lt;ref name=ASHRAE&gt;{{cite book|title=2008 ASHRAE handbook : heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems and equipment|year=2008|publisher=ASHRAE American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers|location=Atlanta, Ga.|isbn=9781933742335|edition=Inch-Pound}}&lt;/ref&gt; An air handler is usually a large metal box containing a [[Fan (mechanical)|blower]], heating or cooling elements, [[air filter|filter]] racks or chambers, sound attenuators, and [[damper (architecture)|dampers]].&lt;ref name=Carrier&gt;{{cite book|title=Carrier Design Manual part 2: Air Distribution|year=1960|publisher=Carrier Corporation|edition=1974 tenth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air handlers usually connect to a [[Duct (HVAC)|ductwork]] [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation system]] that distributes the conditioned air through the building and returns it to the AHU.  Sometimes AHUs discharge (''supply'') and admit (''return'') air directly to and from the space served without ductwork.

Small air handlers, for local use, are called '''terminal units''', and may only include an air filter, coil, and blower; these simple terminal units are called [[blower coil]]s or [[fan coil unit]]s.  A larger air handler that conditions 100% outside air, and no recirculated air, is known as a '''makeup air unit''' ('''MAU''').  An air handler designed for outdoor use, typically on roofs, is known as a '''packaged unit''' ('''PU''') or '''rooftop unit''' ('''RTU''').

==Construction==
The air handler is normally constructed around a framing system with metal infill panels as required to suit the configuration of the components. In its simplest form the frame may be made from metal channels or sections, with single skin metal infill panels. The metalwork is normally [[galvanized]] for long term protection. For outdoor units some form of weatherproof lid and additional sealing around joints is provided.&lt;ref name=Carrier/&gt;

Larger air handlers will be manufactured from a square section steel framing system with double skinned and [[Thermal insulation|insulated]] infill panels. Such constructions reduce heat loss or heat gain from the air handler, as well as providing [[acoustic attenuation]].&lt;ref name=Carrier/&gt; Larger air handlers may be several meters long and are manufactured in a ''sectional'' manner and therefore, for strength and rigidity, steel section base rails are provided under the unit.&lt;ref name=Carrier/&gt;

Where supply and extract air is required in equal proportions for a balanced ventilation system, it is common for the supply and extract air handlers to be joined together, either in a ''side-by-side'' or a ''stacked'' configuration.

==Components==
The major types of components are described here in approximate order, from the return duct (input to the AHU), through the unit, to the supply duct (AHU output).&lt;ref name=ASHRAE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carrier/&gt;

===Filters===
{{main|Air filter}}
Air filtration is almost always present in order to provide clean dust-free air to the building occupants. It may be via simple [[Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value|low-MERV]] pleated media, [[HEPA]], [[Electrostatic precipitator|electrostatic]], or a combination of techniques. Gas-phase and ultraviolet air treatments may be employed as well.

Filtration is typically placed first in the AHU in order to keep all the downstream components clean. Depending upon the grade of filtration required, typically filters will be arranged in two (or more) successive banks with a coarse-grade panel filter provided in front of a fine-grade bag filter, or other "final" filtration medium. The panel filter is cheaper to replace and maintain, and thus protects the more expensive bag filters.&lt;ref name=ASHRAE/&gt;

The life of a filter may be assessed by monitoring the pressure drop through the filter medium at design air volume flow rate. This may be done by means of a visual display using a pressure gauge, or by a pressure switch linked to an alarm point on the building control system. Failure to replace a filter may eventually lead to its collapse, as the forces exerted upon it by the fan overcome its inherent strength, resulting in collapse and thus contamination of the air handler and downstream ductwork.

===Heating and/or cooling elements===
{{main|Heat exchanger#HVAC air coils}}
Air handlers may need to provide heating, cooling, or both to change the supply air temperature, and humidity level depending on the location and the application. Such conditioning is provided by heat exchanger coil(s) within the air handling unit air stream, such coils may be ''direct'' or ''indirect'' in relation to the medium providing the heating or cooling effect.&lt;ref name=ASHRAE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carrier/&gt;

Direct heat exchangers include those for gas-fired fuel-burning heaters or a [[refrigeration]] [[evaporator]], placed directly in the air stream. [[Heating element|Electric resistance]] heaters and [[heat pump]]s can be used as well. [[Evaporative cooling]] is possible in dry climates.

Indirect [[Heat exchanger#HVAC air coils|coils]] use hot [[water]] or [[steam]] for heating, and chilled water for cooling (prime energy for heating and cooling is provided by central plant elsewhere in the building). Coils are typically manufactured from copper for the tubes, with copper or aluminium fins to aid heat transfer. Cooling coils will also employ eliminator plates to remove and drain condensate. The hot water or steam is provided by a central [[boiler]], and the chilled water is provided by a central [[chiller]]. Downstream temperature sensors are typically used to monitor and control "off coil" temperatures, in conjunction with an appropriate motorized control valve prior to the coil. 

If [[dehumidification]] is required, then the cooling coil is employed to ''over-cool'' to that the [[dew point]] is reached and condensation occurs. A heater coil placed after the cooling coil re-heats the air (therefore known as a ''re-heat coil'') to the desired supply temperature. This process has the effect of reducing the [[relative humidity]] level of the supply air.

In colder climates, where winter temperatures regularly drop below freezing, then ''frost coils'' or ''pre-heat'' coils are often employed as a first stage of air treatment to ensure that downstream filters or chilled water coils are protected against freezing. The control of the frost coil is such that if a certain off-coil air temperature is not reached then the entire air handler is shut down for protection.

===Humidifier===
{{main|Humidifier}}
Humidification is often necessary in colder climates where continuous heating will make the air drier, resulting in uncomfortable air quality and increased [[Electrostatics|static electricity]]. Various types of humidification may be used:
*[[Humidifier#Evaporative humidifiers|Evaporative]]: dry air blown over a reservoir will evaporate some of the water. The rate of evaporation can be increased by spraying the water onto baffles in the air stream.
*[[Humidifier#Vaporizers|Vaporizer]]: steam or vapor from a boiler is blown directly into the air stream.
*[[Humidifier#Spray mist|Spray mist]]: water is diffused either by a nozzle or other mechanical means into fine droplets and carried by the air.
*[[ultrasonic humidifier|Ultrasonic]]: A tray of fresh water in the airstream is excited by an ultrasonic device forming a fog or water mist.
*Wetted medium: A fine fibrous medium in the airstream is kept moist with fresh water from a header pipe with a series of small outlets. As the air passes through the medium it entrains the water in fine droplets. This type of humidifier can quickly clog if the primary air filtration is not maintained in good order.

===Mixing chamber===
{{Main|Air-mixing plenum}}
In order to maintain indoor air quality, air handlers commonly have provisions to allow the introduction of outside air into, and the exhausting of air from the building. In temperate climates, mixing the right amount of cooler outside air with warmer return air can be used to approach the desired supply air temperature. A mixing chamber is therefore used which has [[damper (architecture)|dampers]] controlling the ratio between the return, outside, and exhaust air.

===Blower/fan===
{{main|Mechanical fan|Centrifugal fan}}
Air handlers typically employ a large [[Centrifugal fan|squirrel cage blower]] driven by an AC induction [[electric motor]] to move the air. The blower may operate at a single speed, offer a variety of set speeds, or be driven by a [[variable-frequency drive]] to allow a wide range of [[airflow|air flow]] rates. Flow rate may also be controlled by inlet vanes or outlet dampers on the fan. Some residential air handlers in USA (central "furnaces" or "air conditioners") use a [[brushless DC electric motor]] that has variable speed capabilities.&lt;ref name=ASHRAE/&gt;  Air handlers in Europe and Australia and New Zealand now commonly use backward curve fans without scroll or "plug fans".  These are driven using high efficiency EC (electronically commutated) motors with built in speed control. 

Multiple blowers may be present in large commercial air handling units, typically placed at the end of the AHU and the beginning of the supply ductwork (therefore also called "supply fans"). They are often augmented by fans in the return air duct ("return fans") pushing the air into the AHU.

===Balancing===
Un-balanced fans wobble and vibrate.  For home AC fans, this can be a major problem: air circulation is greatly reduced at the vents (as wobble is lost energy), efficiency is compromised, and noise is increased. Another major problem in fans that are not balanced is longevity of the bearings (attached to the fan and shaft) is compromised. This can cause failure to occur long before the bearings life expectancy.

Weights can be strategically placed to correct for a smooth spin (for a ceiling fan, trial and error placement typically resolves the problem). Home / central AC fans or other big fans are typically taken to shops, which have special balancers for more complicated balancing (trial and error can cause damage before the correct points are found).  The fan motor itself does not typically vibrate.

===Heat recovery device===
{{main|Heat recovery ventilation}}
A heat recovery device [[heat exchanger]] may be fitted to the air handler between supply and extract airstreams for energy savings and increasing capacity. These types more commonly include for:
* [[Recuperator]], or Plate Heat exchanger: A sandwich of plastic or metal plates with interlaced air paths. Heat is transferred between airstreams from one side of the plate to the other. The plates are typically spaced at 4 to 6mm apart. Heat recovery efficiency up to 70%.
* [[Thermal Wheel]], or Rotary heat exchanger: A slowly rotating matrix of finely corrugated metal, operating in both opposing airstreams. When the air handling unit is in heating mode, heat is absorbed as air passes through the matrix in the exhaust airstream, during one half rotation, and released during the second half rotation into the supply airstream in a continuous process. When the air handling unit is in cooling mode, heat is released as air passes through the matrix in the exhaust airstream, during one half rotation, and absorbed during the second half rotation into the supply airstream. Heat recovery efficiency up to 85%. Wheels are also available with a [[hydroscopic|hydroscopic coating]] to provide latent heat transfer and also the drying or humidification of airstreams.
* [[Run around coil]]: Two air to liquid heat exchanger coils, in opposing airstreams, piped together with a circulating pump and using water or a brine as the heat transfer medium. This device, although not very efficient, allows heat recovery between remote and sometimes multiple supply and exhaust airstreams.  Heat recovery efficiency up to 50%.
* [[Heat Pipe]]: Operating in both opposing air paths, using a confined [[refrigerant]] as a heat transfer medium. The heat pipe uses multiple sealed pipes mounted in a coil configuration with fins to increase heat transfer. Heat is absorbed on one side of the pipe, by evaporation of the refrigerant, and released at the other side, by condensation of the refrigerant. Condensed refrigerant flows by gravity to the first side of the pipe to repeat the process. Heat recovery efficiency up to 65%.

===Controls===
{{main|Building automation|Building management system}}
[[HVAC control system|Controls]] are necessary to regulate every aspect of an air handler, such as: [[airflow|flow rate of air]], supply air temperature, mixed air temperature, humidity, air quality. They may be as simple as an off/on [[thermostat]] or as complex as a [[building automation]] system using [[BACnet]] or [[LonWorks]], for example.

Common control components include temperature sensors, humidity sensors, sail switches, [[actuator]]s, motors, and controllers.

===Vibration isolators===
The blowers in an air handler can create substantial vibration and the large area of the duct system would transmit this noise and vibration to the occupants of the building. To avoid this, vibration isolators (flexible sections) are normally inserted into the duct immediately before and after the air handler and often also between the fan compartment and the rest of the AHU. The rubberized canvas-like material of these sections allows the air handler components to vibrate without transmitting this motion to the attached ducts.

The fan compartment can be further isolated by placing it on a spring suspension, which will mitigate the transfer of vibration through the floor.

__NOTOC__
[[File:MaraAssault.jpg|thumb|270px|An aniconic representation of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]'s assault on the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], with an [[empty throne]], 2nd century, [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, pp. 1 and 5, fig 4a caption&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Since the beginning of the serious study of the history of [[Buddhist art]] in the 1890s, the earliest phase, lasting until the 1st century CE, has been described as [[aniconic]]; the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] was only represented through symbols such as an [[Hetoimasia|empty throne]],  [[Bodhi]] tree, a riderless horse with a parasol floating above an empty space (at [[Sanchi]]), [[Buddha footprint|Buddha's footprints]], and the [[dharma wheel]].&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, opening pages&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is still some debate, the first [[anthropomorphic]] representations of the Buddha himself are often considered a result of the [[Greco-Buddhist art|Greco-Buddhist]] interaction, in particular in [[Gandhara]], a theory first fully expounded by [[Alfred A. Foucher]], but  criticised from the start by [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]].  Foucher also accounted for the origins of the aniconic symbols themselves in small souvenirs carried away from the main pilgrimage sites and so becoming recognised and popularized as symbolic of the events associated with the site.  Other explanations were that it was inappropriate to represent one who had attained [[nirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1990, the notion of aniconism in Buddhism was challenged by [[Susan Huntington]], initiating a vigorous debate among specialists that still continues.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZCl3DRN3vsC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=Early+Buddhist+Art+and+the+Theory+of+Aniconism&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Early%20Buddhist%20Art%20and%20the%20Theory%20of%20Aniconism&amp;f=false note 7 here] for an update on the controversy as of 2007, and [https://books.google.com/books?id=FHxsDV1GDOIC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Riderless+horse+Buddha&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=Riderless%20horse%20Buddha&amp;f=false here] for another from 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  She sees many early scenes claimed to be aniconic as in fact not depicting scenes from the life of the Buddha, but worship of [[cetiya]] (relics) or re-enactments by devotees at the places where these scenes occurred.  Thus the image of the [[empty throne]] shows an actual relic-throne at [[Bodh Gaya]] or elsewhere.  She points out that there is only one indirect reference for a specific aniconic doctrine in Buddhism to be found, and that pertaining to only one sect.&lt;ref&gt;(Huntington 1990) [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ADM/huntin.htm] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgkKbE-9EhAC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Early+Buddhist+Art+and+the+Theory+of+Aniconism&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Early%20Buddhist%20Art%20and%20the%20Theory%20of%20Aniconism&amp;f=false here]&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the archeological evidence, it shows some anthropomorphic sculptures of the Buddha actually existing during the supposedly aniconic period, which ended during the 1st century CE.  Huntington also rejects the association of "aniconic" and "iconic" art with an emerging division between [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]] Buddhism.  Huntington's views have been challenged by Vidya Dehejia and others.&lt;ref&gt;(Huntington 1990) [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ADM/huntin.htm] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgkKbE-9EhAC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Early+Buddhist+Art+and+the+Theory+of+Aniconism&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Early%20Buddhist%20Art%20and%20the%20Theory%20of%20Aniconism&amp;f=false here]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although some earlier examples have been found in recent years, it is common ground that the large free-standing iconic images of the Buddha so prominent in later Buddhist art are not found in the earliest period; discussion is focused on smaller figures in [[relief]] panels, conventionally considered to represent scenes from the life of the Buddha, and now re-interpreted by Huntington and her supporters.

== Later periods ==
In later periods both the major schools of Buddhism have made great use of representational art, though [[Theravada]] temples and other sites typically concentrate on a single large sculpture of the Buddha, whereas [[Mahayana]] temples have larger numbers of images of a greater variety of figures with varying degrees of spiritual significance.  However some schools, such as [[Zen Buddhism]] in [[Japan]], have also shown a general tendency towards aniconism, though without specific prohibition of figurative images.

'''COPII''' is a [[coatomer]], a type of [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]] coat protein that transports proteins from the [[Endoplasmic reticulum#Rough endoplasmic reticulum|rough endoplasmic reticulum]] to the [[Golgi apparatus]].&lt;ref name="pmid17686639"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee MC, Miller EA | title = Molecular mechanisms of COPII vesicle formation | journal = Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 424‚Äì34 |date=August 2007 | pmid = 17686639 | doi = 10.1016/j.semcdb.2007.06.007 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18060556"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hughes H, Stephens DJ | title = Assembly, organization, and function of the COPII coat | journal = Histochem.

The name "COPII" refers to the specific '''co'''at '''p'''rotein complex that initiates the budding process.  The coat consists of large protein subcomplexes that are made of four different protein subunits.

==Coat proteins==
There are two protein [[heterodimer]]s that form the coat complex.  These proteins are
*[[SEC23A|Sec23p]]/[[SEC24A|Sec24p]] Heterodimer
*[[SEC13|Sec13p]]/[[SEC31|Sec31p]] Heterotetramer
These proteins alone are not able to cause the budding of the vesicle or direct the vesicle to the correct target membrane.  SNARE, cargo, and other proteins are also needed for these processes to occur.  The CopII protein does, however, cause the binding that forms vesicle coat, and thereby causes the release from the ER.  The exact process of how the vesicle is brought to a particular location, or how that location is determined is not yet known.

==Budding process==
The [[GTPase]] [[Sar1]]p is a protein that hydrolyzes [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] and acts like a molecular "switch" that flips between an activated and membrane embedded GTP-bound form, and inactive and soluble GDP-bound form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bonifacino|first=Juan S.|last2=Glick|first2=Benjamin S.|date=2004-01-23|title=The mechanisms of vesicle budding and fusion|journal=Cell|volume=116|issue=2|pages=153‚Äì166|issn=0092-8674|pmid=14744428|doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(03)01079-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inactive GDP-bound Sar1p is attracted to the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum. Sec12, a transmembrane protein found in the ER acts as a Guanine nucleotide exchange factor by stimulating the release of GDP to allow the binding of GTP. Now in a GTP bound state, Sar1p undergoes a conformational change which exposes a hydrophobic tail that can be inserted into the lipid bilayer, binding it to the membrane.  Membrane-bound Sar1p recruits the Sec23p/24p complex to form what is collectively known as the pre-budding complex. The pre-budding complex recruits the long, flexible Sec13p/31p complex.  Sec13p/31p complexes polymerizes on the cytosolic side of the membrane to form a convex mesh structure.  The assembling mesh causes the membrane to bulge outward until a vesicle buds off. Some proteins are found to be responsible for selectively packaging cargos into COPII vesicles. For example, Erv29p in ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' is found to be necessary for packaging glycosylated pro-Œ±-factor.&lt;ref&gt;Belden WJ and Barlowe C. [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5546/1528.full Role of Erv29p in Collecting Soluble Secretory Proteins into ER-Derived Transport Vesicles]. ''Science''. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conformational changes==
CopII has three specific binding sites that can each be complexed.  The adjacent picture (Sed5) uses the Sec22 t-SNARE complex to bind.  This site is more strongly bound, and therefore is more favored. (Embo)

In [[natural theology]] and [[philosophy]], a '''cosmological argument''' is an [[argument]] in which the existence of a unique being, generally seen as some kind of [[god]], is [[deductive reasoning|deduced]] or [[inductive reasoning|inferred]] from facts or alleged facts concerning causation, change, motion, contingency, or finitude in respect of the [[universe]] as a whole or processes within it.&lt;ref name=reichenbach&gt;{{cite web |last=Reichenbach |first=Bruce |title=Cosmological Argument |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Fall 2006 Edition, Edward N.

Whichever term is employed, there are three basic variants of the argument, each with subtle yet important distinctions: the arguments from [[Causality|''in causa'' (causality)]], [[Essence|''in esse'' (essentiality)]], and [[Becoming (philosophy)|''in fieri'' (becoming)]].

The basic premises of all of these are the concept of [[causality]]. The conclusion of these arguments is [[first cause]], subsequently deemed to be [[God]]. The history of this argument goes back to [[Aristotle]] or earlier, was developed in [[Neoplatonism]] and [[early Christianity]] and later in medieval [[Islamic theology]] during the 9th to 12th centuries, and re-introduced to medieval Christian theology in the 13th century by [[Thomas Aquinas]]. The cosmological argument is closely related to the [[principle of sufficient reason]] as addressed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and [[Samuel Clarke]], itself a modern exposition of the claim that "[[nothing comes from nothing]]" attributed to [[Parmenides]].

[[Image:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], depicted here in [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens]]'', both developed first cause arguments.]]

[[Plato]] (c. 427‚Äì347 BC) and [[Aristotle]] (c. 384‚Äì322 BC) both posited first cause arguments, though each had certain notable caveats.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, WL., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qbFKAwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=plato+cosmological+argument&amp;q=%22chapter+1%22+natural#v=snippet&amp;q=%22chapter%201%22%20natural&amp;f=false ''The Cosmological Argument from Plato to Leibniz''], Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2001, pp. 1-5, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Laws]]'' (Book X), Plato posited that all movement in the world and the [[Cosmos]] was "imparted motion". This required a "self-originated motion" to set it in motion and to maintain it. In ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', Plato posited a "demiurge" of supreme wisdom and intelligence as the creator of the Cosmos.

Aristotle argued ''against'' the idea of a first cause, often confused with the idea of a "[[Primum movens|prime mover]]" or "[[unmoved mover]]" ({{lang|grc|œÄœÅ·ø∂œÑŒøŒΩ Œ∫ŒπŒΩŒø·ø¶ŒΩ ·ºÄŒ∫ŒØŒΩŒ∑œÑŒøŒΩ}} or ''primus motor'') in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' VIII, 4‚Äì6; ''Metaphysics'' XII, 1‚Äì6.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle argued in ''favor'' of the idea of several unmoved movers, one powering each [[celestial sphere]], which he believed lived beyond the sphere of the fixed stars, and explained why motion in the universe (which he believed was eternal) had continued for an infinite period of time. Aristotle argued the [[atomism|atomist's]] assertion of a non-eternal universe would require a [[first uncaused cause]] ‚Äî in his terminology, an [[four causes|efficient]] first cause ‚Äî an idea he considered a non-sensical flaw in the reasoning of the atomists.

Like Plato, Aristotle believed in an eternal [[cosmos]] with no beginning and no end (which in turn follows [[Parmenides]]' famous statement that "[[nothing comes from nothing]]"). In what he called "first philosophy" or metaphysics, Aristotle ''did'' intend a theological correspondence between the prime mover and deity (presumably [[Zeus]]); functionally, however, he provided an explanation for the apparent motion of the "[[fixed stars]]" (now understood as the daily rotation of the Earth). According to his theses, immaterial unmoved movers are eternal unchangeable beings that constantly think about thinking, but being immaterial, they're incapable of interacting with the cosmos and have no knowledge of what transpires therein. From an "aspiration or desire",&lt;ref&gt;"Cosmological Argument for the Existence of God", in ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967), Vol. 2, p233 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[celestial spheres]], ''imitate'' that purely intellectual activity as best they can, by [[uniform circular motion]]. The unmoved movers ''inspiring'' the [[classical planets|planetary]] spheres are no different in kind from the prime mover, they merely suffer a dependency of relation to the prime mover. Correspondingly, the motions of the planets are subordinate to the motion inspired by the prime mover in the sphere of fixed stars. Aristotle's natural theology admitted no creation or capriciousness from the immortal [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], but maintained a defense against dangerous charges of impiety.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

[[Plotinus]], a third-century Platonist, taught that the One transcendent absolute caused the universe to exist simply as a consequence of its existence (''creatio ex deo''). His disciple Proclus stated "The One is God".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Centuries later, the [[Islamic]] [[philosopher]] [[Avicenna]] (c. 980‚Äì1037) inquired into the question of [[being]], in which he distinguished between [[essence]] (''Mahiat'') and [[existence]] (''Wujud''). He argued that the fact of existence could not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things, and that form and matter by themselves could not originate and interact with the movement of the Universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Thus, he reasoned that existence must be due to an [[Causality|agent cause]] that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must coexist with its effect and be an existing thing.&lt;ref name="Islam in Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= | authorlink= | title=Islam |year=2007| encyclopedia=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online | accessdate=2007-11-27|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Duncan writes that "it was first formulated by a Greek-speaking Syriac Christian neo-Platonist, [[John Philoponus]]," who claims to find a contradiction between the Greek pagan insistence on the eternity of the world and the Aristotelian rejection of the existence of any actual infinite." Referring to the argument as the "'[[Kalam]]' cosmological argument", Duncan asserts that it "received its fullest articulation at the hands of [medieval] Muslim and Jewish exponents of ''Kalam'' ("the use of reason by believers to justify the basic metaphysical presuppositions of the faith)."&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, S., ''Analytic philosophy of religion: its history since 1955'', Humanities-Ebooks, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] (c. 1225‚Äì1274) adapted and enhanced the argument he found in his reading of Aristotle and Avicenna to form one of the most influential versions of the cosmological argument.&lt;ref&gt;Summa Theologica, St. Thomas Aquinas&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott David Foutz, [http://www.quodlibet.net/aqu5ways.shtml An Examination of Thomas Aquinas' Cosmological Arguments as found in the Five Ways], ''Quodlibet Online Journal of Christian Theology and Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; His conception of First Cause was the idea that the Universe must be caused by something that is itself uncaused, which he claimed is that which we call God:    "The second way is from the nature of the efficient cause. In the world of sense we find there is an order of efficient causes. There is no case known (neither is it, indeed, possible) in which a thing is found to be the efficient cause of itself; for so it would be prior to itself, which is impossible. Now in efficient causes it is not possible to go on to infinity, because in all efficient causes following in order, the first is the cause of the intermediate cause, and the intermediate is the cause of the ultimate cause, whether the intermediate cause be several, or only one. Now to take away the cause is to take away the effect. Therefore, if there be no first cause among efficient causes, there will be no ultimate, nor any intermediate cause. But if in efficient causes it is possible to go on to infinity, there will be no first efficient cause, neither will there be an ultimate effect, nor any intermediate efficient causes; all of which is plainly false. Therefore it is necessary to admit a first efficient cause, to which everyone gives the name of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/FP/FP002.html#FPQ2A3THEP1|title=Summa Theologica|author=|date=|website=www.dhspriory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 {{dubious|date=September 2014}}&lt;!--this is just a repetition of Aristotle's concept. Aquinas was more specific and more subtle than that.--&gt; Importantly, Aquinas' Five Ways, given the second question of his Summa Theologica, are not the entirety of Aquinas' demonstration that the Christian God exists. The Five Ways form only the beginning of Aquinas' Treatise on the Divine Nature.

== Versions of the argument ==

=== Argument from contingency ===

In the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] era, [[Aquinas]] formulated the "argument from [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]", following [[Aristotle]] in claiming that there must be something to explain why the Universe exists.{{dubious|date=May 2017}}&lt;!-- Aristotle did not believe in a first cause; is this a misreading? --&gt; Since the Universe could, under different circumstances, conceivably ''not'' exist (contingency), its existence must have a cause ‚Äì not merely another contingent thing, but something that exists by [[INUS|necessity]] (something that ''must'' exist in order for anything else to exist).&lt;ref&gt;''Summa Theologiae, I :'' 2,3&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, even if the Universe has always existed, it still owes its existence to an [[Primum movens|uncaused cause]],&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas was an ardent student of Aristotle's works, a significant number of which had only recently been translated into Latin by [[William of Moerbeke]] .&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas further said: "...and this we understand to be God."&lt;ref&gt;''Summa Theologiae, I : '' 2,3&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas's argument from contingency allows for the possibility of a Universe that has no beginning in time. It is a form of argument from universal [[Causality|causation]]. Aquinas observed that, in nature, there were things with contingent existences. Since it is possible for such things not to exist, there must be some time at which these things did not in fact exist. Thus, according to Aquinas, there must have been a time when nothing existed. If this is so, there would exist nothing that could bring anything into existence. Contingent beings, therefore, are insufficient to account for the existence of contingent beings: there must exist a ''[[INUS|necessary]]'' being whose non-existence is an impossibility, and from which the existence of all contingent beings is derived.

The German philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] made a similar argument with his [[principle of sufficient reason]] in 1714. "There can be found no fact that is true or existent, or any true proposition," he wrote, "without there being a sufficient reason for its being so and not otherwise, although we cannot know these reasons in most cases." He formulated the cosmological argument succinctly: "Why is there something rather than nothing?  The sufficient reason [...] is found in a substance which [...] is a necessary being bearing the reason for its existence within itself."&lt;ref&gt;''Monadologie'' (1714). [[Nicholas Rescher]], trans., 1991. ''The Monadology: An Edition for Students''. Uni. of Pittsburg Press. [http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdf/leibmon.pdf Jonathan Bennett's translation.] [http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/philos/classics/leibniz/monad.htm Latta's translation.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz's contingency argument was summarised by [[William Lane Craig]], as follows:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36cKSRVojRE&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. Everything that exists has an explanation of its existence.
:2. If the universe has an explanation of its existence, that explanation is God.
:3. The universe exists.
:4. The universe has an explanation of its existence.
:5. Therefore, the explanation of the universe's existence is God.

Craig states that the only disputable statements are 1. and 2. He defended 1. from the question of 'What caused God?' by saying that God cannot be caused by anything, as that would imply that there is something greater than him, which is logically contradictory. He also denied that the universe was an exception to the rule, claiming that such a proposition [[begs the question|begging the question]]. He states &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpz7NaUDJU4&lt;/ref&gt; that saying 2. is wrong contradicts modern science, and that, far from not being specific to the God of Christianity, it actually leads to evidence specifically linking to a being outside of space and time, as well as one that is omnipotent and omniscient.

=== ''In esse'' and ''in fieri'' ===

The difference between the arguments from causation ''[[Becoming (philosophy)|in fieri]]'' and ''[[Essence|in esse]]'' is a fairly important one. ''In fieri'' is generally translated as "becoming", while ''in esse'' is generally translated as "in essence". ''In fieri'', the process of becoming, is similar to building a house. Once it is built, the builder walks away, and it stands on its own accord; compare the [[watchmaker analogy]]. (It may require occasional maintenance, but that is beyond the scope of the first cause argument.)

''In esse'' (essence) is more akin to the light from a candle or the liquid in a vessel. George Hayward Joyce, [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], explained that "...where the light of the candle is dependent on the candle's continued existence, not only does a candle produce light in a room in the first instance, but its continued presence is necessary if the illumination is to continue. If it is removed, the light ceases. Again, a liquid receives its shape from the vessel in which it is contained; but were the pressure of the containing sides withdrawn, it would not retain its form for an instant." This form of the argument is far more difficult to separate from a purely first cause argument than is the example of the house's maintenance above, because here the First Cause is insufficient without the candle's or vessel's continued existence.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, George Hayward (1922) ''Principles of Natural Theology''. NY: Longmans Green.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]' argument is ''in fieri'', while [[Aquinas]]' argument is both ''in fieri'' and ''in esse''. This distinction is an excellent example of the difference between a [[deistic]] view (Leibniz) and a [[theistic]] view (Aquinas). As a general trend, the modern slants on the cosmological argument, including the [[Kalam cosmological argument|Kalam argument]], tend to lean very strongly towards an ''in fieri'' argument.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The philosopher [[Robert Koons]] has stated a new variant on the cosmological argument. He says that to deny causation is to deny all empirical ideas- for example, if we know our own hand, we know it because of the chain of causes including light being reflected upon one's eyes, stimulating the retina and sending a message through the optic nerve into your brain. He summarised the purpose of the argument as 'that if you don‚Äôt buy into theistic metaphysics, you‚Äôre undermining empirical science. The two grew up together historically and are culturally and philosophically inter-dependent‚Ä¶ If you say I just don‚Äôt buy this causality principle ‚Äì that‚Äôs going to be a big big problem for empirical science.' This ''in fieri'' version of the argument therefore does not intend to prove God, but only to disprove objections involving science, and the idea that contemporary knowledge disproves the cosmological argument. &lt;ref&gt;https://crossexamined.org/new-proofs-gods-existence/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== KalƒÅm cosmological argument ===
{{Main|Kalam cosmological argument}}
William Lane Craig gives this argument in the following general form:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William L. |title=The Existence of God and the Beginning of the Universe |work=Truth Journal |publisher=Leaderu.com |accessdate=22 June 2008 |url=http://www.leaderu.com/truth/3truth11.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Whatever begins to exist has a cause.
# The Universe began to exist.
# Therefore, the Universe had a cause.

Craig explains, by nature of the event (the Universe coming into existence), attributes unique to (the concept of) God must also be attributed to the cause of this event, including but not limited to: omnipotence, Creator, being eternal and absolute self-sufficiency. Since these attributes are unique to God, anything with these attributes must be God. Something does have these attributes: the cause; hence, the cause is God, the cause exists; hence, God exists.

Craig defends the second premise, that the Universe had a beginning starting with [[Al-Ghazali]]'s proof  that an [[actual infinite]] is impossible. However, If the universe never had a beginning then there indeed '''would''' be an actual infinite, an infinite amount of cause and effect events. Hence, the Universe had a beginning.
&lt;!--
# the form advocated by Aquinas based on the impossibility of the "essential" ordering of an infinite regress; Aquinas argues that  only an "incidental" ordering among causes, but not an "essential" ordering, can reach back forever.
# the argument that an infinite regress is impossible because an [[actual infinite]] is impossible; this form is called the [[kalam cosmological argument]] by Craig, as he traces its first formulation to [[Al-Ghazali]].
# the argument from the [[principle of sufficient reason]], presented by Leibniz and Clarke.

A version of the cosmological argument could be stated as follows:

# Every finite and [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] being has a cause.
# A [[Causality|causal]] loop cannot exist.
# A causal chain cannot be of infinite length.
# Therefore, a First Cause (or something that is not an effect) must exist.
--&gt;

===Metaphysical argument for the existence of God===

[[Duns Scotus]], the influential Medieval Christian theologian, created a metaphysical argument for the existence of God. Though it was inspired by Aquinas' argument from motion, he, like other philosophers and theologians, believed that his statement for God's existence could be considered separate to Aquinas'. His explanation for God's existence is long, and can be summarised as follows:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.logicmuseum.com/wiki/Authors/Duns_Scotus/Ordinatio/Ordinatio_I/D2/Q2B&lt;/ref&gt;
#Something can be produced.
#It is produced by itself, something or another.
#Not by nothing, because nothing causes nothing.
#Not by itself, because an effect never causes itself.
#Therefore, by another ''A''.
#If A is first then we have reached the conclusion.
#If A is not first, then we return to 2).
#From 3) and 4), we produce another- ''B''. The ascending series is either infinite or finite.
#An infinite series is not possible.
#Therefore, God exists.

Scotus deals immediately with two objections he can see: first, that there cannot be a first, and second, that the argument falls apart when 1) is questioned. He states that [[infinite regress]] is impossible, because it provokes unanswerable questions, like, in modern English, 'What is infinity minus infinity?' The second he states can be answered if the question is rephrased using [[modal logic]], meaning that the first statement is instead 'It is possible that something can be produced.'

== Objections and counterarguments ==
{{see also|M√ºnchhausen trilemma}}

=== What caused the First Cause? ===
{{The Works of Aristotle}}
One objection to the argument is that it leaves open the question of why the First Cause is unique in that it does not require any causes. Proponents argue that the First Cause is exempt from having a cause, while opponents argue that this is [[special pleading]] or otherwise untrue.&lt;ref name=reichenbach/&gt; Critics often press that arguing for the First Cause's exemption raises the question of why the First Cause is indeed exempt,&lt;ref name=cline&gt;{{cite web |last=Cline |first= Austin |title=Cosmological Argument: Does the Universe Require a First Cause? {{pipe}} Agnosticism/Atheism |publisher=About.com |accessdate=June 20, 2008 |url=http://atheism.about.com/od/argumentsforgod/a/cosmological.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas defenders maintain that this question has been answered by the various arguments, emphasizing that none of its major forms rests on the premise that everything has a cause.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=07bHgxbG6A4C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=curious+blind+spot+in+the+anglo+cause+everything&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m3aujzj-la&amp;sig=aYqS9OJfoATKgcskZ3NLi7BAvx0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=H9InVPvmJYvKaLPAguAO&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=curious%20blind%20spot%20in%20the%20anglo%20cause%20everything&amp;f=false Clarke, WN., "A Curious Blind Spot in the Anglo-American Tradition of Antitheistic Argument", in ''The Creative Retrieval of Saint Thomas Aquinas: Essays in Thomistic Philosophy, New and Old'', Fordham Univ Press, 2009, Ch. 5.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Lane Craig]], who famously uses the [[Kalam cosmological argument]], argues that, as the infinite is impossible, whichever perspective the viewer takes, there must always have been one unmoved thing to begin the universe. He uses [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]] and the question 'What is infinity minus infinity?' to illustrate the idea that the infinite is metaphysically, mathematically, and even conceptually, impossible. Other reasons include the fact that it is impossible to count down from infinity, and that, had the universe existed for an infinite amount of time, every possible event, including the final end of the universe, would already have occurred. He therefore states his argument in three points- firstly, everything that begins to exist has a cause of its existence; secondly, the universe began to exist; so, thirdly, therefore, the universe has a cause of its existence. &lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmological-argument/#4.3&lt;/ref&gt; A response to this argument would be that the cause of the universe's existence (God) would need a cause for its existence, which, in turn, could be responded to as being logically inconsistent with the evidence already presented- even if God did have a cause, there would still necessarily be a cause which began everything, owing to the impossibility of the infinite stated by Craig.

Secondly, it is argued that the premise of [[causality]] has been arrived at via ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' ([[Inductive reasoning|inductive]]) reasoning, which is dependent on experience. [[David Hume]] highlighted this [[problem of induction]] and argued that [[Causality|causal relations]] were not true ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. However, as to whether inductive or deductive reasoning is more valuable still remains a matter of debate, with the general conclusion being that neither is prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/dedind.php |title=Deduction &amp; Induction |publisher=Socialresearchmethods.net |date=2006-10-20 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the argument tend to argue that it is unwise to draw conclusions from an extrapolation of causality beyond experience.&lt;ref name=reichenbach/&gt; Andrew Loke replies that, according to the [[Kalam Cosmological Argument]], only things which begin to exist require a cause. On the other hand, something that is without beginning has always existed and therefore does not require a cause. The Cosmological Argument shows that there cannot be an actual infinite regress of causes, therefore there must be an uncaused First Cause that is beginningless and does not require a cause. &lt;ref&gt; Andrew Loke, God and Ultimate Origins (Cham: Springer Nature, 2017), p. 189; Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Not evidence for a theist God ===
The basic cosmological argument merely establishes that a First Cause exists, not that it has the attributes of a [[theistic]] god, such as [[omniscience]], [[omnipotence]], and [[omnibenevolence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cosmological Argument for the Existence of God |author=Austin Cline |publisher= About, Inc. |date=27 July 2015 |accessdate=3 August 2016 |url=http://atheism.about.com/od/argumentsforgod/a/cosmological.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is why the argument is often expanded to show that at least some of these attributes are necessarily true, for instance in the modern Kalam argument given above.&lt;ref name=reichenbach /&gt;

=== Existence of causal loops ===
A causal loop is a form of [[predestination paradox]] arising where traveling backwards in time is deemed a possibility. A sufficiently powerful entity in such a world would have the capacity to travel backwards in time to a point before its own existence, and to then create itself, thereby initiating everything which [[Logical consequence|follows from]] it.

The usual reason which is given to refute the possibility of a causal loop is it requires that the loop as a whole be its own cause. [[Richard Hanley]] argues that causal loops are not logically, physically, or epistemically impossible: "[In timed systems,] the only possibly objectionable feature that all causal loops share is that coincidence is required to explain them."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hanley, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/v436qxx802383534 No End in Sight: Causal Loops in Philosophy, Physics and Fiction], ''Synthese''&lt;/ref&gt; However, Andrew Loke argues that causal loop of the type that is supposed to avoid a First Cause suffers from the problem of vicious circularity and thus it would not work.  &lt;ref&gt; Andrew Loke, ''God and Ultimate Origins'' (Cham: Springer Nature, 2017), chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Existence of infinite causal chains ===
[[David Hume]] and later [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]] have invoked a similar principle in their criticisms of the cosmological argument. Rowe has called the principle the Hume-Edwards principle:&lt;ref&gt;Alexander R. Pruss, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/q134n458307w0125 The Hume-Edwards Principle and the Cosmological Argument], ''International Journal for Philosophy of Religion''&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|If the existence of every member of a set is explained, the existence of that set is thereby explained.}}

Nevertheless, David White argues that the notion of an [[infinite regress|infinite causal regress]] providing a proper explanation is fallacious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=David E.|title=An argument for God's existence|journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m4t816n217704nxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Demea states that even if the succession of causes is infinite, the whole chain still requires a cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calvert|first=Brian|title=Another problem about Part IX of Hume's Dialogues|journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r5x5g687h06571w6}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain this, suppose there exists a causal chain of infinite contingent beings. If one asks the question, "Why are there any contingent beings at all?", it won‚Äôt help to be told that "There are contingent beings because other contingent beings caused them."  That answer would just presuppose additional contingent beings. An adequate explanation of why some contingent beings exist would invoke a different sort of being, a necessary being that is ''not'' contingent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A response might suppose each individual is contingent but the infinite chain as a whole is not; or the whole infinite causal chain to be its own cause.

Severinsen argues that there is an "infinite" and complex causal structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Severinsen|first=Morten|title=Principles Behind Definitions of Diseases ‚Äì a Criticism of the Principle of Disease Mechanism and the Development of a Pragmatic Alternative|journal=Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/hm2t476u01543017|quote=This implies that there is an "infinite" and complex causal structure behind each disease, and that the disease mechanism would have to encompass the whole structure.}}&lt;/ref&gt; White tried to introduce an argument ‚Äúwithout appeal to the principle of sufficient reason and without denying the possibility of an infinite causal regress‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=David E.|title=An argument for God's existence|journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m4t816n217704nxv|quote=My intention is to show that a cosmological argument for God's existence (not that of a first cause simpliciter) can be constructed without appeal to the principle of sufficient reason and without denying the possibility of an infinite causal regress.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other arguments have been offered to demonstrate that an actual infinite regress cannot exist, viz. the argument for the impossibility of concrete actual infinities, the argument for the impossibility of traversing an actual infinite, the argument from the lack of capacity to begin to exist, and various arguments from paradoxes. &lt;ref&gt;Andrew Loke, ''God and Ultimate Origins'' (Cham: Springer Nature, 2017), chapters 2 and 3; Waters,   Ben.   2013.   "Methuselah‚Äôs   Diary   and   the   Finitude   of   the   Past." ''Philosophia Christi'' 15: 463‚Äì469; Koons, Robert. 2014. ''A New Kalam Argument: Revenge of the Grim Reaper.'' No√ªs 48: 256‚Äì267.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Big Bang cosmology===

Some cosmologists and physicists argue that a challenge to the cosmological argument is the nature of time: "One finds that time just disappears from the [[Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Folger|first=Tim|title=Time may not exist|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2007/jun/in-no-time/|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ([[Carlo Rovelli]]). The [[Big Bang theory]] states that it is the point in which all [[dimension]]s came into existence, the start of both [[space]] and [[time]].&lt;ref name="sciam"&gt;(J. Richard Gott III, James E. Gunn, David N. Schramm, and Beatrice M. Tinsley, "Will the Universe Expand Forever?" Scientific American [March 1976], p. 65)&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the question "What was there before the Universe?" makes no sense; the concept of "before" becomes meaningless when considering a situation without time.&lt;ref name="sciam"/&gt; This has been put forward by J. Richard Gott III, James E. Gunn, David N. Schramm, and [[Beatrice Tinsley]], who said that asking what occurred before the Big Bang is like asking what is north of the [[North Pole]].&lt;ref name="sciam"/&gt; However, some cosmologists and physicists do attempt to investigate causes for the Big Bang, using such scenarios as the collision of [[Membrane (M-Theory)|membrane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Britt |first=Robert R. |title=Brane-Storm {{pipe}} Challenges Part of Big Bang Theory |publisher=Space.com |date=April 18, 2001 |accessdate=June 21, 2008 |url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/bigbang_alternative_010413-3.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511144628/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/bigbang_alternative_010413-3.html |archivedate=11 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Edward Feser]] states that classical philosophers' arguments for the existence of God do not care about the Big Bang or whether the universe had a beginning. The question is not about what got things started or how long they have been going, but rather what keeps them going.&lt;ref&gt;Feser, Edward, The Last Superstition, St. Augustine Press 2008, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, the above objections can be dispelled by separating the Cosmological Argument from the A-Theory of Time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Benjamin Victor Waters |date=9 July 2015 |title=Toward a new kalƒÅm cosmological argument |work=Cogent Arts and Humanities |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1080/23311983.2015.1062461 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311983.2015.1062461 |accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently discussing God as a ''timeless'' (rather than "before" in a linear sense) cause of the Big Bang. There is also a Big Bang Argument, which is a variation of the Cosmological Argument using the Big Bang Theory to validate the premise that the Universe had a beginning.&lt;ref&gt;An article mentioning the existence of such an argument, but not necessarily endorsing it: http://strangenotions.com/why-we-should-be-cautious-using-the-big-bang-argument.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''College of Science''' ('''COS''') of [[De La Salle University]] was originally part of the '''College of Arts and Sciences'''. In 1982, the departments of [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]], [[Mathematics]] and [[Physics]] separated to form the '''College of Science''' while the [[liberal arts]] departments formed the [[De La Salle University College of Liberal Arts|College of Liberal Arts]]. Although the College of Science is the youngest and the second smallest college formed in the university, its contribution to the academe and to the country has had tremendous impact to scientific research development and nation-building. And thus in recognition of their efforts, all of the Science and Mathematics programs of the college have been granted the recognition of [[Center of Excellence]] in the [[Philippines]] by the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]].

In [[machine learning]], particularly in the creation of [[artificial neural networks]], '''ensemble averaging''' is the process of creating multiple models and combining them to produce a desired output, as opposed to creating just one model. Frequently an ensemble of models performs better than any individual model, because the various errors of the models "average out."

== Overview ==
Ensemble averaging is one of the simplest types of [[committee machine]]s. Along with [[Boosting (meta-algorithm)|boosting]], it is one of the two major types of static committee machines.&lt;ref name="haykin"&gt;Haykin, Simon. Neural networks : a comprehensive foundation. 2nd ed. Upper Saddle River  N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to standard network design in which many networks are generated but only one is kept, ensemble averaging keeps the less satisfactory networks around, but with less weight.&lt;ref name="hashem"&gt;Hashem, S. "Optimal linear combinations of neural networks." Neural Networks 10, no. 4 (1997): 599&amp;ndash;614.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of ensemble averaging relies on two properties of artificial neural networks:&lt;ref name="naft"&gt;Naftaly, U., N. Intrator, and D. Horn. "Optimal ensemble averaging of neural networks." Network: Computation in Neural Systems 8, no. 3 (1997): 283&amp;ndash;296.&lt;/ref&gt;

# In any network, the bias can be reduced at the cost of increased variance
# In a group of networks, the variance can be reduced at no cost to bias

Ensemble averaging creates a group of networks, each with low bias and high variance, then combines them to a new network with (hopefully) low bias and low variance. It is thus a resolution of the [[bias-variance dilemma]].&lt;ref name="geman"&gt;Geman, S., E. Bienenstock, and R. Doursat. "Neural networks and the bias/variance dilemma." Neural computation 4, no. 1 (1992): 1&amp;ndash;58.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of combining experts has been traced back to [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]].&lt;ref&gt;Clemen, R. T. "Combining forecasts: A review and annotated bibliography." International Journal of Forecasting 5, no. 4 (1989): 559&amp;ndash;583.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
The theory mentioned above gives an obvious strategy: create a set of experts with low bias and high variance, and then average them. Generally, what this means is to create a set of experts with varying parameters; frequently, these are the initial synaptic weights, although other factors (such as the learning rate, momentum etc.) may be varied as well. Some authors recommend against varying weight decay and early stopping.&lt;ref name="naft" /&gt; The steps are therefore:
# Generate ''N'' experts, each with their own initial values. (Initial values are usually chosen randomly from a distribution.)
# Train each expert separately.
# Combine the experts and average their values.
Alternatively, [[domain knowledge]] may be used to generate several ''classes'' of experts. An expert from each class is trained, and then combined.

A more complex version of ensemble average views the final result not as a mere average of all the experts, but rather as a weighted sum. If each expert is &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt;, then the overall result &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as:
: &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{\alpha}) = \sum_{j=1}^{p} \alpha_j y_j(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is a set of weights. The optimization problem of finding alpha is readily solved through neural networks, hence a "meta-network" where each "neuron" is in fact an entire neural network can be trained, and the synaptic weights of the final network is the weight applied to each expert. This is known as a ''linear combination of experts''.&lt;ref name="hashem" /&gt;

It can be seen that most forms of neural networks are some subset of a linear combination: the standard neural net (where only one expert is used) is simply a linear combination with all &lt;math&gt;\alpha_j = 0&lt;/math&gt; and one &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k=1&lt;/math&gt;. A raw average is where all &lt;math&gt;\alpha_j&lt;/math&gt; are equal to some constant value, namely one over the total number of experts.&lt;ref name="hashem" /&gt;

A more recent ensemble averaging method is negative correlation learning,&lt;ref&gt;Y. Liu and X. Yao, [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608099000738 Ensemble Learning via Negative Correlation] Neural Networks, Volume 12, Issue 10, December 1999, pp. 1399-1404. {{doi|10.1016/S0893-6080(99)00073-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed by Y. Liu and X. Yao. Now this method has been widely used in [[evolutionary computing]].

== Benefits ==
* The resulting committee is almost always less complex than a single network which would achieve the same level of performance&lt;ref&gt;Pearlmutter, B. A., and R. Rosenfeld. "Chaitin&amp;ndash;Kolmogorov complexity and generalization in neural networks." In Proceedings of the 1990 conference on Advances in neural information processing systems 3, 931. Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc., 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The resulting committee can be trained more easily on smaller input sets&lt;ref name="haykin" /&gt;
* The resulting committee often has improved performance over any single network&lt;ref name="hashem" /&gt;
* The risk of [[overfitting]] is lessened, as there are fewer parameters (weights) which need to be set&lt;ref name="haykin" /&gt;

'''Eschatological verification''' describes a process whereby a proposition can be verified after death. A proposition such as "there is an afterlife" is verifiable if true but not falsifiable if false (if it's false, the individual will not know it's false, because they have no state of being). The term is most commonly used in relation to [[God]] and the [[afterlife]], although there may be other propositions - such as moral propositions - which may also be verified after death. 

[[John Hick]] has expressed the premise as an allegory of a quest to a Celestial City. In this parable, a [[theist]] and an [[atheist]] are both walking down the same road. The theist believes there is a destination, the atheist believes there is not. If they reach the destination, the theist will have been proven right; however, if there is no destination on an endless road, this can never be verified. This is an attempt to explain how a theist expects some form of life or existence after death and an atheist does not. They both have separate belief systems and live life accordingly, but logically one is right and the other is not. If the theist is right, he will be proven so when he arrives in the afterlife. However, if the atheist is right, they will simply both be dead and nothing will be verified.

This acts as a response to [[Verificationism]]. Under Hick's analogy claims about the [[afterlife]] are verifiable ''in principle'' because the truth becomes clear after death. To some extent it is therefore wrong to claim that religious language cannot be verified because it can (when you're dead).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6873">'''Evolutionary rescue''' is a theoretical situation in which a population recovers from environmental pressure through advantageous genetic change rather than increased gene flow, migration, dispersal or other demographic rescue techniques. While the term was first used in 1995 in Richard Gomulkiewicz and Robert Holt's essay in the journal ''Evolution'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gomulkiewicz|first1=Richard|last2=Holt|first2=Robert|title=When does natural selection save a population from extinction?|journal=Evolution|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theory has since academically matured through review and modeling. The most commonly used meaning of the term was established in Gonzalez et al. (2012), which states that evolutionary rescue "occurs when genetic adaptation allows a population to recover from demographic effects initiated by environmental change that would otherwise cause extirpation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Andrew|title=Evolutionary rescue; an emerging focus at the intersection between ecology and evolution|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical framework ==
Due to rapid losses of [[biodiversity]], [[climate change]], and rapid spread of [[non-native species]] due to [[globalization]], natural environments are changing faster now than in any other time point in human history. Given that traditional framework of [[evolution]] emphasizes that ecologically relevant evolution occurs slowly for the plant and animal kingdoms, the 20th century and 21st century shift in the rate of environmental change naturally raises questions of contemporary evolution. The central question in the framework of evolutionary rescue remains, "If contemporary evolution, also referred to as rapid evolution, occurs, can it be fast enough to foster population persistence in extremely small time-scales?". Proponents of the evolutionary rescue hypothesis argue that evolutionary rescue is a unique phenomenon, separate from two commonly studied escapes from ecological pressures, demographic and genetic rescues. While [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] is a key aspect to all three population survival strategies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=G|title=Evolutionary rescue and the limits of adaptation|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; evolutionary rescue is the only one driven by adaptive evolution mechanistically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gonzales|first1=A.|title=Evolutionary rescue: an emerging focus at the intersection between ecology and evolution|journal= Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci.|date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demographic rescue is simply a dynamic driven by source-sink immigration dynamics, whereas genetic rescue is primarily driven by hybridization in combination with immigration. Given the reliance on immigration, it can be difficult to disentangle demographic rescue from genetic rescue. The distinction between these three rescue strategies may be difficult to prove, if it exists, although rescue from negative population growth may be a hallmark.

[[File:Theoretical Depiction of Evolutionary Rescue.png|thumb|left|alt=a theoretical depiction of evolutionary rescue.|The theoretical characterization of evolutionary rescue may be a U-shaped curve.]]

It may be easier to find quantifiable evidence for evolutionary rescue in rapidly shifting environments versus gradually shifting environments (climate change, ocean acidification, etc.). High localization and source-sink biogeographic demographic dynamics may also increase the likelihood of evolutionary rescue. Evolutionary rescue may also be highly characterized by a U-shaped curve, in which the population declines sharply until it passes a stochastic threshold, at which the adaptive allele frequency rapidly increases, with the population rebounding at a slower rate as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gomulkiewicz|first1=R.|title=When does evolution by natural selection prevent extinction? |journal=Evolution|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most vulnerable part of the evolutionary rescue process, theoretically, should be the time point during which the population is beyond the stochastic threshold, which exposes the population to random outcomes not determined by genetic or evolutionary mechanisms.

== Empirical evidence ==

While there is empirical evidence for evolutionary rescue, it is important to note that missing temporal, demographic or allelic data makes the majority of these examples suggestive of evolutionary rescue at best. For example, the demographic shifts in ''Gasterosteus aculeatus'' from weakly armored to heavily armored variants following [[bioremediation]] of water clarity in Lake Washington, USA, suggest that increased the predatory efficiency of ''Oncorhynchus clarkii'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kitano|first1=J|title=Reverse evolution of armor plates in the threespine stickleback|journal=Current Biology|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although inclusion versus exclusion treatments at controlled densities would provide stronger mechanistic support. Another possible example of evolutionary rescue in nature is the selective response of redbellied black snakes (''Pseudechis porphyriacus'') to cane toads (''Rhinella marina'') in [[Australia]], in which ''P. porphyriacus'' exposed to ''R. marina'' for long periods of time demonstrated rapid adaptive shifts in resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phillips|first1=B.L|last2=Shine|first2=R|title=An invasive species induces rapid adaptive change in a native predator: cane toads and black snakes in Australia|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unresolved questions ==
At the point in time, more substantial theoretical, modeling and empirical work is needed to distinguish evolutionary rescue from traditionally adaptation discourse in the evolutionary biology field.  Currently, one of the key arguments separating evolutionary rescue from adaptation is the reliance on absolutely fitness versus relative fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kliman|first1=Richard|title= AN Encyclopedia of Evolutionary Biology|publisher= Academic Press|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the theory of evolutionary rescue may help inform future [[Conservation biology|conservation]] efforts, more work is needed to explain the role of the interplay between dispersal and negative density dependence on an organism's short-term and long-term capacity for adaptation and evolutionary rescue. Furthermore, more in-depth work on the role of [[stochastic]] fluctuations, particularly in the determination of stochastic thresholds, is needed to establish evolutionary rescue as a viable explanation for trends in evolutionary biology.

[[Krypton-85]], half-life 10.76 years, is formed by the fission process with
a fission yield of about 0.3%. Only 20% of the '''fission products''' of mass 85 become &lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt;Kr itself; the rest passes through a short-lived [[nuclear isomer]] and then to stable &lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt;Rb. If irradiated reactor fuel is [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessed]], this radioactive [[krypton]] may be released into the air. This krypton release can be detected and used as a means of detecting clandestine nuclear reprocessing. Strictly speaking, the stage which is detected is the dissolution of [[used nuclear fuel]] in [[nitric acid]], as it is at this stage that the krypton and other fission gases like the more abundant [[xenon]] are released.

Increase of [[Nuclear fission|fission]] gases above a certain limit can lead to fuel pin swelling and even puncture, so that fission gas measurement after discharging the fuel from the reactor is most important to make burn-up calculations, to study the nature of fuel inside the reactor, behaviour with pin materials, for effective utilization of fuel and also reactor safety.

The [[strontium]] radioisotopes are very important as strontium is a [[calcium]] mimic which is incorporated in bone growth and therefore has a great ability to harm humans. On the other hand, this also allows &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Sr to be used in the open source [[radiotherapy]] of [[bone tumor]]s. This tends to be used in [[palliative]] care to reduce the pain due to secondary [[tumor]]s in the [[bone]]s.

[[Strontium-90]] is a strong [[beta decay|beta]] emitter with a [[half-life]] of 28.8 years. Its [[fission product yield]] decreases as the mass of the [[fissile]] nuclide increases. A map of &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr  contamination around [[Chernobyl]] has been published by the [[IAEA]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub886_web/Chernobylmap2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Yttrium-89 ==
{| 
|{{Iso2|89|Y |R}}||{{Iso2|90|Y |V}}||{{Iso2|91|Y |I}}
|}
The only stable [[yttrium]] isotope, &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Y, will be found with yield somewhat less than 1% in a fission product mixture which has been allowed to age for months or years, as the other isotopes have half-lives of 106.6 days or less.

&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr decays into &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Y which is a beta emitter with a half-life of 2.67 days.
&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Y is sometimes used for [[medical]] purposes and can be obtained either by the [[neutron activation]] of stable &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Y or by using a device similar to a [[technetium cow]].

A significant amount of [[zirconium]] is formed by the fission process; some of this are short-lived radioactives (&lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;Zr and &lt;sup&gt;97&lt;/sup&gt;Zr which decay to [[molybdenum]]), while almost 10% of the fission products mixture after years of decay consists of five stable or nearly stable isotopes of zirconium plus [[Zirconium-93|&lt;sup&gt;93&lt;/sup&gt;Zr]] with a halflife of 1.53 million years which is one of the 7 major [[long-lived fission product]]s.

In [[PUREX]] plants the zirconium sometimes forms a [[third phase]] which can be a disturbance in the plant. The third phase is the term in solvent extraction given to a third layer (such as [[foam]] and/or emulsion) which forms from the two layers in the solvent extraction process. The zirconium forms the third phase by forming small particles which stabilise the [[emulsion]] which is the third phase.

== Niobium-95 ==
{|
|{{Iso1|95|Nb|I}}
|}
Niobium-95 with a halflife of 35 days is initially present as a fission product. The only stable isotope of [[niobium]] has mass number 93, and fission products of mass 93 become relatively stable zirconium-93 (half life 1.53 Ma).

The fission product mixture contains significant amounts of [[molybdenum]].

{|
|{{Iso2|[[Tc-99|99]]|Tc|Y}}

[[technetium-99|&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc]], half-life 211k years, is produced at a yield of about 6% per fission; see also the main [[fission product]]s page.

== Ruthenium-101 to 106 ==
{|
|{{Iso1|101|Ru|R}}||{{Iso1|102|Ru|R}}||{{Iso1|103|Ru|I}}||{{Iso1|104|Ru|R}}||{{Iso1|105|Ru|V}}||{{Iso1|106|Ru|B}}
|}
Plenty of both stable [[ruthenium]] and radioactive ruthenium-103 is formed by the fission process. The ruthenium in [[PUREX raffinate]] can become oxidized to form [[ruthenium tetroxide]] which forms a purple vapour above the surface of the aqueous liquor. The ruthenium tetroxide is very similar to [[osmium tetroxide]], the ruthenium compound is a stronger oxidant which enables it to form deposits by reacting with other substances. In this way the ruthenium in a reprocessing plant is very mobile and can be found in odd places. Also at [[Chernobyl]] during the fire the ruthenium became volatile and behaved differently from many of the other metallic fission products. Some of the particles which were emitted by the fire were very rich in ruthenium.

In addition the ruthenium in PUREX [[raffinate]] forms a large number of [[nitrosyl]] complexes which makes the chemistry of the ruthenium very complex. The [[ligand]] exchange rate at ruthenium and [[rhodium]] tends to be long, hence it can take a long time for a ruthenium or rhodium compound to react.

It has been suggested that the ruthenium and palladium in PUREX raffinate should be used as a source of the metals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nea.fr/html/pt/docs/iem/jeju02/session2/SessionII-14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kiae.ru/eng/inf/tex/t52.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rhodium-103 ==
{|
|{{Iso2|103|Rh|R}}|| ||{{Iso2|105|Rh|V}}
|}
While less rhodium than ruthenium and palladium is formed (around 3.6% yield), the mixture of fission products still contains a significant amount of this metal. Due to the high prices of ruthenium, [[rhodium]] and palladium some work has been done on the separation of these metals to enable them to be used at a later date. Because of the possibility of the metals being contaminated by radioactive isotopes, metals are not suitable for making consumer products such as [[jewellery]] but this source of the metals could be used for [[catalyst]]s in industrial plants such as petrochemical plants.

Potential Applications of Fission Platinoids in Industry, Zdenek Kolarik, ''Platinum Metals Review'', 2005, '''49''', April (2).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.platinummetalsreview.com/dynamic/&lt;/ref&gt;

A dire example of people being exposed to radiation from contaminated jewellery occurred in the United States where it is thought that the [[gold]] seeds which were used to contain [[radon]] were [[recycle]]d into jewellery. The gold did contain radioactive decay products of &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/hpposters/goldjewelry.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull413/article9.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

A great deal of [[palladium]] forms during the fission process. In [[nuclear reprocessing]], not all of the fission palladium dissolves; also some palladium that dissolves at first comes out of solution later. Palladium-rich dissolver fines (particles) are often removed as they interfere with the solvent extraction process by stabilising the [[third phase]].

The fission palladium can separate during the process in which the [[PUREX raffinate]] is combined with [[glass]] and heated to form the final [[high level waste]] form. The palladium forms an [[alloy]] with the fission tellurium. This alloy can separate from the glass.

[[Isotopes of tellurium|Tellurium-128 and -130]] are essentially stable. They only decay by [[double beta decay]], with half lives &gt;10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; years.  They constitute the major fraction of natural occurring [[tellurium]] at 32 and 34% respectively.
[[Tellurium-132]] and its daughter &lt;sup&gt;132&lt;/sup&gt;[[Isotopes of iodine|I]] are important in the first few days after a criticality. It was responsible for a large fraction of the dose inflicted on workers at [[Chernobyl]] in the first week.

The [[isobar (nuclide)|isobar]] forming &lt;sup&gt;132&lt;/sup&gt;Te/&lt;sup&gt;132&lt;/sup&gt;I is: [[Tin-132]] (half-life 40 s) decaying to [[antimony-132]] (half-life 2.8 minutes) decaying to [[tellurium-132]] (half-life 3.2 days) decaying to [[iodine-132]] (half-life 2.3 hours) which decays to stable xenon-132.

The creation of [[tellurium-126]] is delayed by the long half-life (230 k years) of [[tin-126]].

[[Iodine-131|&lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I]], with a half-life of 8 days, is a hazard from [[nuclear fallout]] because iodine concentrates in the [[thyroid gland]]. See also [[Radiation effects from Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster#Iodine-131]] and
[[Downwinders#Nevada]].

In common with &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Sr, &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I is used for the treatment of [[cancer]]. A small dose of &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I can be used in a thyroid function test while a large dose can be used to destroy the thyroid cancer. This treatment will also normally seek out and destroy any secondary [[tumor]] which arose from a thyroid cancer. Much of the energy from the [[Beta particle|beta]] emission from the &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I will be absorbed in the thyroid, while the [[gamma ray]]s are likely to be able to escape from the thyroid to irradiate other parts of the body.

Large amounts of &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I was released during an experiment named the [[Green Run]]&lt;ref&gt;{{web archive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508030806/http://archive.tri-cityherald.com/thyroid/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which fuel which had only been allowed to cool for a short time after irradiation was reprocessed in a plant which had no iodine scrubber in operation.

[[Iodine-129|&lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I]], with a half-life almost a billion times as long, is a [[long-lived fission product]].

[[Iodine-127|&lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;I]] is stable, the only one of the [[isotopes of iodine]] that is nonradioactive. It makes up only about {{frac|1|6}} of the iodine in spent fuel, with I-129 about {{frac|5|6}}.

== Xenon-131 to 136 ==
{|
|{{Iso2|131|Xe|R|I}}||{{Iso1|132|Xe|R}}||{{Iso2|133|Xe|V|V}}||{{Iso1|134|Xe|R}}||{{Iso1|[[Xe-135|135]]|Xe}}||{{Iso1|136|Xe|O}}

In reactor fuel, the fission product [[xenon]] tends to migrate to form [[liquid bubble|bubble]]s in the fuel. As caesium 133, 135, and 137 are formed by the [[beta particle]] decay of the corresponding xenon isotopes, this causes the caesium to become physically separated from the bulk of the uranium oxide fuel.

Because &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe is a potent [[nuclear poison]] with a large [[Neutron cross-section|cross section]] for [[neutron]] absorption, the buildup of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe in the fuel inside a power reactor can lower the [[reactivity (nuclear)|reactivity]] greatly. If a power reactor is shut down or left running at a low power level, then large amounts of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe can build up through decay of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;I. When the reactor is restarted or the low power level is increased significantly, &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe will be quickly consumed through [[neutron capture]] reactions and the reactivity of the core will increase. Under some circumstances, control systems may not be able to respond quickly enough to manage an abrupt reactivity increase as the built-up &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe burns off. It is thought that [[xenon poisoning]] was one of the factors which led to the power surge which damaged the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] reactor core.

[[Caesium-137]] with a half-life of 30 years is the main [[medium-lived fission product]], along with Sr-90.
Cs-137 is the primary source of penetrating [[gamma radiation]] from spent fuel until 300 years or more after discharge.
It is the most significant radioisotope left in the area around [[Chernobyl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub886_web/Chernobylmap1.html IAEA map]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caesium-134]] is found in [[spent nuclear fuel]] but is not produced by [[nuclear weapon]] explosions, as it is only formed by [[neutron capture]] on stable Cs-133, which is only produced by [[beta decay]] of Xe-133 with a half-life of 3 days. Cs-134 has a half-life of 2 years and may be a major source of gamma radiation in the first few years after discharge.

[[Caesium-135]] is a [[long-lived fission product]] with much weaker radioactivity. [[Neutron capture]] inside the reactor diverts much of the [[xenon-135]] that would otherwise decay to Cs-135.

A lot of [[barium]] is formed by the fission process, a short lived barium isotope was confused with radium by some early workers. They were bombarding uranium with neutrons in an attempt to form a new element. But instead they caused fission which generated a large amount of radioactivity in the target. Because the chemistry of barium and radium the two elements could be coseparated by for instance a precipitation with [[sulfate]] anions. Because of this similarity of their chemistry the early workers thought that the very radioactive fraction which was separated into the "radium" fraction contained a new isotope of radium. Some of this early work was done by [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]].

A great deal of the lighter [[lanthanide]]s ([[lanthanum]], [[cerium]], [[neodymium]], and [[samarium]]) are formed as fission products. In [[Africa]] at [[Oklo]] where the [[natural nuclear fission reactor]] operated millions of years ago the isotopic mixture of neodymium is not the same as 'normal' neodymium, it has an isotope pattern very similar to the neodymium formed by fission.

In the aftermath of [[criticality accident]]s the level of &lt;sup&gt;140&lt;/sup&gt;La is often used to determine the fission yield (in terms of the number of nuclei which underwent fission).

[[Samarium-149]] is the second most important [[neutron poison]] in nuclear reactor physics. [[Samarium-151]], produced at lower yields, is the third most abundant [[medium-lived fission product]] but emits only weak [[beta radiation]]. Both have high neutron absorption cross-sections, so that much of them produced in a reactor are later destroyed there by neutron absorption.

In [[molecular cloning]] and [[biology]], a '''knock-in''' (or '''gene knock-in''') refers to a [[genetic engineering]] method that involves the one-for-one substitution of DNA sequence information in a genetic locus or the insertion of sequence information not found within the locus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Greg|title=A Primer Of Genome Science 3rd ed.|year=2009|publisher=Sinauer|location=Sunderland, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-87893-236-8|pages=301‚Äì302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, this is done in mice since the technology for this process is more refined and there is a high degree of shared sequence complexity between mice and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Initial sequencing and comparative analysis of the mouse genome|journal = Nature|date = 2002-12-05|issn = 0028-0836|pmid = 12466850|pages = 520‚Äì562|volume = 420|issue = 6915|doi = 10.1038/nature01262|last = Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium|first2 = Robert H.|last2 = Waterston|first3 = Kerstin|last3 = Lindblad-Toh|first4 = Ewan|last4 = Birney|first5 = Jane|last5 = Rogers|first6 = Josep F.|last6 = Abril|first7 = Pankaj|last7 = Agarwal|first8 = Richa|last8 = Agarwala|first9 = Rachel|last9 = Ainscough}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between knock-in technology and traditional [[transgenic]] techniques is that a knock-in involves a gene inserted into a specific locus, and is thus a "targeted" insertion.

A common use of knock-in technology is for the creation of disease models. It is a technique by which scientific investigators may study the function of the regulatory machinery (e.g. [[promoter (biology)|promoters]]) that governs the expression of the natural gene being replaced. This is accomplished by observing the new phenotype of the organism in question. The [[Bacterial artificial chromosome|BACs]] and [[Yeast artificial chromosome|YACs]] are used in this case so that large fragments can be transferred.

== Technique ==
Gene knock-in originated as a slight modification of the original knockout technique developed by Martin Evans, Oliver Smithies, and Mario Capecchi. Traditionally, knock-in techniques have relied on homologous recombination to drive targeted gene replacement, although other methods using a transposon-mediated system to insert the target gene have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westphal|first=C. H.|last2=Leder|first2=P.|date=1997-07-01|title=Transposon-generated 'knock-out' and 'knock-in' gene-targeting constructs for use in mice|journal=Current Biology|volume=7|issue=7|pages=530‚Äì533|issn=0960-9822|pmid=9210379|doi=10.1016/s0960-9822(06)00224-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of ''loxP'' flanking sites that become excised upon expression of Cre recombinase with gene vectors is an example of this. Embryonic stem cells with the modification of interest are then implanted into a viable blastocyst, which will grow into a mature chimeric mouse with some cells having the original blastocyst cell genetic information and other cells having the modifications introduced to the embryonic stem cells. Subsequent offspring of the chimeric mouse will then have the gene knock-in.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Gene knock-in has allowed, for the first time, hypothesis-driven studies on gene modifications and resultant phenotypes. Mutations in the human p53 gene, for example, can be induced by exposure to benzo(a)pyrene and the mutated copy of the p53 gene can be inserted into mouse genomes. Lung tumors observed in the knock-in mice offer support for the hypothesis of BaP‚Äôs carcinogenicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Zhipei|last2=Muehlbauer|first2=Karl-Rudolf|last3=Schmeiser|first3=Heinz H.|last4=Hergenhahn|first4=Manfred|last5=Belharazem|first5=Djeda|last6=Hollstein|first6=Monica C.|date=2005-04-01|title=p53 mutations in benzo(a)pyrene-exposed human p53 knock-in murine fibroblasts correlate with p53 mutations in human lung tumors|journal=Cancer Research|volume=65|issue=7|pages=2583‚Äì2587|doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3675|issn=0008-5472|pmid=15805253}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent developments in knock-in technique have allowed for pigs to have a gene for green fluorescent protein inserted with a [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas9]] system, which allows for much more accurate and successful gene insertions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruan|first=Jinxue|last2=Li|first2=Hegang|last3=Xu|first3=Kui|last4=Wu|first4=Tianwen|last5=Wei|first5=Jingliang|last6=Zhou|first6=Rong|last7=Liu|first7=Zhiguo|last8=Mu|first8=Yulian|last9=Yang|first9=Shulin|date=2015-09-18|title=Highly efficient CRISPR/Cas9-mediated transgene knockin at the H11 locus in pigs|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep14253|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=5|pages=14253|doi=10.1038/srep14253|pmc=4585612|pmid=26381350}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knock-in also allows for biallelic modifications to some genes to be generated and the phenotype in mice observed in a single generation, an unprecedented timeframe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Yanliang|last2=Li|first2=Junhong|last3=Xiang|first3=Jinzhu|last4=Wen|first4=Bingqiang|last5=Mu|first5=Haiyuan|last6=Zhang|first6=Wei|last7=Han|first7=Jianyong|date=2015-12-10|title=Highly efficient generation of biallelic reporter gene knock-in mice via CRISPR-mediated genome editing of ESCs|journal=Protein &amp; Cell|language=en|volume=7|issue=2|pages=152‚Äì156|doi=10.1007/s13238-015-0228-3|issn=1674-800X|pmc=4742388|pmid=26661644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Versus gene knockout ==

Knock-in technology is different from [[Gene knockout|knockout]] technology in that knockout technology aims to either delete part of the DNA sequence or insert irrelevant DNA sequence information to disrupt the expression of a specific genetic locus. Gene knock-in technology, on the other hand, alters the genetic locus of interest via a one-for-one substitution of DNA sequence information or by the addition of sequence information that is not found on said genetic locus. A gene knock-in therefore can be seen as a gain of function mutation and a gene knockout a loss of function mutation, but a gene knock-in may also involve the substitution of a functional gene locus for a mutant phenotype that results in some loss of function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Construction of Transgenic and Gene Knockout/Knockin Mouse Models of Human Disease|journal = Transgenic Research|date = 2012-04-01|issn = 0962-8819|pmc = 3516403|pmid = 21800101|pages = 327‚Äì349|volume = 21|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s11248-011-9537-3|first = Alfred|last = Doyle|first2 = Michael P.|last2 = McGarry|first3 = Nancy A.|last3 = Lee|first4 = James J.|last4 = Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential applications ==

Because of the success of gene knock-in methods thus far, many clinical applications can be envisioned. Knock-in of sections of the human [[immunoglobulin gene]] into mice has already been shown to allow them to produce humanized antibodies that are therapeutically useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ig knock-in mice producing anti-carbohydrate antibodies: breakthrough of B cells producing low affinity anti-self antibodies|journal = Journal of Immunology|date = 2008-03-15|issn = 0022-1767|pmid = 18322191|pages = 3839‚Äì3848|volume = 180|issue = 6|first = Lorenzo|last = Benatuil|first2 = Joel|last2 = Kaye|first3 = Nathalie|last3 = Cretin|first4 = Jonathan G.|last4 = Godwin|first5 = Annaiah|last5 = Cariappa|first6 = Shiv|last6 = Pillai|first7 = John|last7 = Iacomini|doi=10.4049/jimmunol.180.6.3839}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be possible to modify [[stem cell]]s in humans to restore targeted gene function in certain tissues, for example possibly correcting the mutant gamma-chain gene of the [[IL-2 receptor]] in hematopoietic stem cells to restore lymphocyte development in people with X-linked [[severe combined immunodeficiency]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Knock out, knock in, knock down--genetically manipulated mice and the Nobel Prize|journal = The New England Journal of Medicine|date = 2007-12-13|issn = 1533-4406|pmid = 18077807|pages = 2426‚Äì2429|volume = 357|issue = 24|doi = 10.1056/NEJMp0707712|first = John P.|last = Manis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==

While gene knock-in technology has proven to be a powerful technique for the generation of models of human disease and insight into proteins ''in vivo'', numerous limitations still exist. Many of these are shared with the limitations of knockout technology. First, combinations of knock-in genes lead to growing complexity in the interactions that inserted genes and their products have with other sections of the genome and can therefore lead to more side effects and difficult-to-explain [[phenotype]]s. Also, only a few loci, such as the ROSA26 locus have been characterized well enough where they can be used for conditional gene knock-ins, making combinations of [[reporter gene|reporter]] and transgenes in the same locus problematic. The biggest disadvantage of using gene knock-in for human disease model generation is that mouse physiology is not identical to that of humans and human [[ortholog]]s of proteins expressed in mice will often not wholly reflect the role of a gene in human pathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Transgenic mouse technology in skin biology: generation of knockin mice|journal = The Journal of Investigative Dermatology|date = 2014-12-01|issn = 1523-1747|pmid = 25381772|pages = 1‚Äì3|volume = 134|issue = 12|doi = 10.1038/jid.2014.434|first = Frederik|last = Tellkamp|first2 = Farida|last2 = Benhadou|first3 = Jeroen|last3 = Bremer|first4 = Maria|last4 = Gnarra|first5 = Jana|last5 = Kn√ºver|first6 = Sandra|last6 = Schaffenrath|first7 = Susanne|last7 = Vorhagen}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in mice produced with the [[ŒîF508]] fibrosis mutation in the [[Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator|CFTR gene]], which accounts for more than 70% of the mutations in this gene for the human population and leads to cystic fibrosis. While ŒîF508 CF mice do exhibit the processing defects characteristic of the human mutation, they do not display the pulmonary pathophysiological changes seen in humans and carry virtually no lung phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pathophysiology of Gene-Targeted Mouse Models for Cystic Fibrosis|url = http://physrev.physiology.org/content/79/1/S193|journal = Physiological Reviews|date = 1999-01-01|issn = 0031-9333|pmid = 9922382|pages = S193‚ÄìS214|volume = 79|issue = 1|language = en|first = Barbara R.|last = Grubb|first2 = Richard C.|last2 = Boucher|doi = 10.1152/physrev.1999.79.1.S193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such problems could be ameliorated by the use of a variety of animal models, and pig models (pig lungs share many biochemical and physiological similarities with human lungs) have been generated in an attempt to better explain the activity of the ŒîF508 mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Production of CFTR-null and CFTR-DeltaF508 heterozygous pigs by adeno-associated virus-mediated gene targeting and somatic cell nuclear transfer|journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation|date = 2008-04-01|issn = 0021-9738|pmc = 2265103|pmid = 18324337|pages = 1571‚Äì1577|volume = 118|issue = 4|doi = 10.1172/JCI34773|first = Christopher S.|last = Rogers|first2 = Yanhong|last2 = Hao|first3 = Tatiana|last3 = Rokhlina|first4 = Melissa|last4 = Samuel|first5 = David A.|last5 = Stoltz|first6 = Yuhong|last6 = Li|first7 = Elena|last7 = Petroff|first8 = Daniel W.|last8 = Vermeer|first9 = Amanda C.|last9 = Kabel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Grammy Award]] for '''Best Engineered Recording, Classical''' has been awarded since  1959.  The award had several minor name changes:

*In 1959 the award was known as '''Best Engineered Record (Classical)'''
*From 1960 to 1962 it was awarded as '''Best Engineering Contribution - Classical Recording'''
*From 1963 to 1964 it was awarded as '''Best Engineered Recording - Classical'''
*In 1965 it was awarded as '''Best Engineered Recording'''
*From 1966 to 1994 it returned to the title '''Best Engineered Recording, Classical'''
*From 1966 to 1994 it was awarded as '''Best Classical Engineered Recording'''
*Since 1992 it has been awarded as '''Best Engineered Album, Classical'''

This award is presented alongside the [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical]].  From 1960 to 1965 a further award was presented for [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Recording - Special or Novel Effects|Best Engineered Recording - Special or Novel Effects]].

Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were presented, for works released in the previous year.

The award is presented to engineers (and, if applicable, mastering engineers), not to artists, orchestras, conductors or other performers on the winning works, except if the engineer is also a performer.

[[Image:Phylogenetic tree.svg|thumb|right|400px|A three domain [[phylogenetic tree|tree]] of life showing the separation of [[Bacteria]], [[Archaea]], and [[Eukaryote]] domains. See [[Microorganisms]] article for further explanation.]]

Scientists trying to reconstruct evolutionary history have been challenged by the fact that genes can sometimes transfer between distant branches on the [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]. This movement of genes can occur through [[horizontal gene transfer]] (HGT), scrambling the information on which biologists relied to reconstruct the [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]] of organisms. Conversely, HGT can also help scientists to reconstruct and date the tree of life. Indeed, a gene transfer can be used as a phylogenetic marker, or as the proof of contemporaneity of the donor and recipient organisms, and as a trace of extinct biodiversity.

HGT happens very infrequently ‚Äì at the individual organism level, it is highly improbable for any such event to take place. However, on the grander scale of evolutionary history, these events occur with some regularity. On one hand, this forces to abandon the use of individual genes as good markers for the history of life. On the other hand, this provides an almost unexploited large source of information about the past.

== Three domains of life ==

The three main early branches of the tree of life have been intensively studied by [[Microorganism|microbiologists]] because the first organisms were microorganisms. Microbiologists (led by [[Carl Woese]]) have introduced the term ''[[Domain (biology)|domain]]'' for the three main branches of this tree, where ''domain'' is  a phylogenetic term similar in meaning to biological [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]. To reconstruct this tree of life, the gene sequence encoding the small subunit of [[ribosome|ribosomal]] [[RNA]] (SSU rRNA, [[16s rRNA]]) has proven useful, and the tree (as shown in the picture) relies heavily on information from this single gene.

These three domains of life represent the main evolutionary lineages of early cellular life and currently include [[Bacteria]], [[Archaea]] (single-celled organisms superficially similar to bacteria), and [[Eukaryote|Eukarya]]. Eukarya includes only organisms having a well-defined nucleus, such as [[fungi]], [[protist]]s, and all organisms in the plant and animals kingdoms (see figure).

The gene most commonly used for constructing phylogenetic relationships in [[prokaryote|microorganisms]] is the small subunit ribosomal RNA  gene, as its sequences tend to be conserved among members with close phylogenetic distances, yet variable enough that differences can be measured.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Woese C, etal | title = Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya| url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/87/12/4576| journal = PNAS USA| volume = 87 | pages = 4576‚Äì9 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2112744 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | issue = 12 | pmc = 54159 | bibcode=1990PNAS...87.4576W}}

The SSU rRNA as a measure of evolutionary distances was pioneered by [[Carl Woese]] when formulating the first modern "tree of life", and his  results led him to propose the [[Archaea]] as a third domain of [[life]]. However, recently it has been argued that SSU rRNA genes can also be horizontally transferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yap | first1 = WH | last2 = Zhang | first2 = Z | last3 = Wang | first3 = Y | title = Distinct types of rRNA operons exist in the genome of the actinomycete Thermomonospora chromogena and evidence for horizontal transfer of an entire rRNA operon. | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 181 | issue = 17 | pages = 5201‚Äì9 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10464188 | pmc = 94023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this may be rare, this possibility is forcing scrutiny of the validity of phylogenetic trees based on SSU rRNAs.

Recent discoveries of "rampant" HGT in microorganisms, and the detection of horizontal movement of even genes for the small subunit of ribosomal RNA, have forced biologists to question the accuracy of at least the early branches in the tree, and even question the validity of trees as useful models of how early evolution occurs.&lt;ref name="Simonson2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simonson | first1 = AB | last2 = Servin | first2 = JA | last3 = Skophammer | first3 = RG | last4 = Herbold | first4 = CW | last5 = Rivera | first5 = MC | last6 = Lake | first6 = JA | title = Decoding the genomic tree of life. | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 Suppl 1 | pages = 6608‚Äì13 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15851667 | pmc = 1131872 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0501996102 |bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.6608S }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;
"Sequence comparisons suggest recent horizontal transfer of many [[gene]]s among diverse [[species]] including across the boundaries of [[phylogenetic]] "domains". Thus determining the phylogenetic history of a species can not be done conclusively by determining evolutionary trees for single genes." &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19990220101406/http://opbs.okstate.edu/%7Emelcher/MG/MGW3/MG334.html Horizontal Gene Transfer, Oklahoma State]&lt;/ref&gt; HGT is thus a potential [[Lurking variable|confounding factor]] in inferring [[phylogenetic tree]]s from the [[sequence]] of one [[gene]]. For example, if two distantly related bacteria have exchanged a gene, a [[phylogenetic tree]] including those species will show them to be closely related even though most other genes have diverged substantially. For this reason it is important to use other information to infer phylogenies, such as the presence or absence of genes, or, more commonly, to include as wide a range of genes for analysis as possible.

==Choice of metaphor: tree, a net, cobweb, or ring==
In his article ''Uprooting the Tree of Life'', W. [[Ford Doolittle]] discusses the [[Last universal ancestor|Last Universal Common Ancestor]] ‚Äì the root of the Tree of Life ‚Äì and the problems with that concept posed by HGT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0200-90 | last1 = Doolittle | first1 = WF | year = 2000 | title = Uprooting the tree of life | url = | journal = Sci Am | volume = 282 | issue = 2| pages = 90‚Äì5 | pmid = 10710791 | bibcode = 2000SciAm.282b..90D }}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the microorganism ''Archaeoglobus fulgidus'' as an anomaly with respect to a [[phylogenetic]] tree based upon the code for the [[enzyme]] [[HMGCoA reductase]] ‚Äì the organism is definitely an archaean, with all the cell lipids and transcription machinery  expected of an archaean, but its HMGCoA genes are of bacterial origin. In the article, Doolittle says that while it is now widely accepted that [[mitochondria]] in eukaryotes derived from alpha-proteobacterial cells and that [[chloroplast]]s came from ingested [[cyanobacteria]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;
".. it is no longer safe to assume that those were the only lateral gene transfers that occurred after the first eukaryotes arose. Only in later, multicellular eukaryotes do we know of definite restrictions on horizontal gene exchange, such as the advent of separated (and protected) [[germ cell]]s...

If there had never been any lateral gene transfer, all these individual gene trees would have the same topology (the same branching order), and the ancestral genes at the root of each tree would have all been present in the last universal common ancestor, a single ancient cell. But extensive transfer means that neither is the case: gene trees will differ (although many will have regions of similar topology) ''and'' there would never have been a single cell that could be called the last universal common ancestor..."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Doolittle suggested that the universal common ancestor cannot have been one particular organism, but must have been a loose, diverse conglomeration of primitive cells that evolved together. These early cells, each with relatively few genes, differed in many ways, and swapped their [[gene]]s freely. Eventually, from these eclectic cells came the three domains of life as we know them today: [[bacteria]], [[archaea]] and [[eukaryote]]. These domains are now recognizably distinct because much of the gene transfer that still occurs is within these domains, rather than between them. Biologist [[Johann Peter Gogarten|Peter Gogarten]] reinforced these arguments, and suggested that the metaphor of a tree does not fit the data from recent genome research, and that biologists should instead use "the metaphor of a mosaic to describe the different histories combined in individual genomes and use [the] metaphor of a net to visualize the rich exchange and cooperative effects of HGT among microbes."&lt;ref&gt;Gogarten JP 'Horizontal Gene Transfer ‚Äì A New Paradigm for Biology' [http://www.esalenctr.org/display/confpage.cfm?confid=10&amp;pageid=105&amp;pgtype=1 PhD thesis]

Despite the uncertainties in reconstructing phylogenies back to the beginnings of life, progress is being made in reconstructing the tree of life in the face of uncertainties raised by HGT. The uncertainty of any inferred phylogenetic tree based on a single gene can be resolved by using several common genes or even evidence from whole genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Jonathan Eisen]] and [[Claire M. Fraser|Claire Fraser]] have pointed out that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In building the tree of life, analysis of whole genomes has begun to supplement, and in some cases to improve upon, studies previously done with one or a few genes. For example, recent studies of complete bacterial genomes have suggested that the hyperthermophilic species are not deeply branching; if this is true, it casts doubt on the idea that the first forms of life were thermophiles. Analysis of the genome of the eukaryotic parasite ''Encephalitozoon cuniculi'' supports suggestions that the group ''Microsporidia'' are not deep branching protists but are in fact members of the fungal kingdom. Genome analysis can even help resolve relationships within species, such as by providing new genetic markers for population genetics studies in the bacteria causing anthrax or tuberculosis. In all these studies, it is the additional data provided by a complete genome sequence that allows one to separate the phylogenetic signal from the noise. This is not to say the tree of life is now resolved ‚Äì we only have sampled a smattering of genomes, and many groups are not yet touched"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Eisen | first1 = J.| last2 = Fraser | first2 = C.| title = Phylogenomics: intersection of evolution and genomics| journal = Science| volume = 300| issue = 5626| pages = 1706‚Äì1707| year = 2003| pmid = 12805538| doi = 10.1126/science.1086292|bibcode = 2003Sci...300.1706E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These approaches are enabling estimates of the relative frequency of HGT; the relatively low values that have been observed suggests that the 'tree' is still a valid metaphor for evolution ‚Äì but the tree is adorned with 'cobwebs' of horizontally transferred genes. This is the main conclusion of a 2005 study of more than 40 complete microbial genomic sequences by Fan Ge, Li-San Wang, and [[Junhyong Kim]]. They estimate the frequency of HGT events at about 2% of core genes per genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ge | first1 = Fan | last2 = Wang | first2 = Li-San | last3 = Kim | first3 = Junhyong | title = The Cobweb of Life Revealed by Genome-Scale Estimates of Horizontal Gene Transfer | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = e316 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030316 | pmc = 1233574 | pmid=16122348}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar whole genome approaches to assessing evolution are also enabling progress in identifying very early events in the tree of life, such as a proposal that eukaryotes arose by fusion of two complete but very diverse prokaryote genomes: one from a bacterium and one from an archaeal cell.&lt;ref name="Simonson2005" /&gt;

Such a fusion of organisms [[hypothesis]] for the origin of complex nucleated cells has been put forward by [[Lynn Margulis]] using quite different reasoning about [[symbiosis]] between a bacterium and an archaen arising in an ancient consortium of microbes.&lt;ref&gt;''Acquiring genomes: a theory of the origin of species.'' Margulis L and Sagan D (2002) Basic Books {{ISBN|0-465-04392-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The use of horizontal transfer for evolutionary studies ==
While HGT is often seen as a challenge for the reconstruction of the tree of life, an alternative view is that oppositely it provides additional valuable information for its reconstruction.

First, for the recipient organism, HGT is a DNA mutation like others, and as such, it can be modeled and used in tree reconstruction and rooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abby|first=Sophie S.|last2=Tannier|first2=Eric|last3=Gouy|first3=Manolo|last4=Daubin|first4=Vincent|date=2012-03-27|title=Lateral gene transfer as a support for the tree of life|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1116871109|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=109|issue=13|pages=4962‚Äì4967|doi=10.1073/pnas.1116871109|pmc=3323970|bibcode=2012PNAS..109.4962A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, it is necessary that the recipient of a gene acquisition by HGT lives at the same time, or at a ulterior time, as the donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-60327-853-9_7|title=Horizontal Gene Transfer|last=Huang|first=Jinling|last2=Gogarten|first2=Johann Peter|date=2009|publisher=Humana Press|isbn=9781603278522|series=Methods in Molecular Biology|pages=127‚Äì139|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-60327-853-9_7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In consequence there is an information on the timing of diversification in HGT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dav√≠n|first=Adri√°n A.|last2=Tannier|first2=Eric|last3=Williams|first3=Tom A.|last4=Boussau|first4=Bastien|last5=Daubin|first5=Vincent|last6=Sz√∂ll≈ësi|first6=Gergely J.|date=2018-04-02|title=Gene transfers can date the tree of life|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0525-3|journal=Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution|language=En|doi=10.1038/s41559-018-0525-3|issn=2397-334X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is all the more remarkable since the principal usual source for dating in the living world, the fossil record, is absent precisely where HGT is abundant, in the microbial world.

Third, it provides information about the extinct biodiversity, because transfers are likely from extinct species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sz√∂ll≈ësi|first=Gergely J.|last2=Tannier|first2=Eric|last3=Lartillot|first3=Nicolas|last4=Daubin|first4=Vincent|date=2013-05-01|title=Lateral Gene Transfer from the Dead|url=https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/62/3/386/1651886|journal=Systematic Biology|language=en|volume=62|issue=3|pages=386‚Äì397|doi=10.1093/sysbio/syt003|issn=1063-5157|arxiv=1211.4606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jaan! in Hakui.jpg|thumb|An example of Japanese sound symbolism, "''jaan!''"]]
'''Ideophones''' are words that evoke an idea in sound, often a vivid impression of certain sensations or sensory perceptions, e.g. sound ([[onomatopoeia]]), movement, color, shape, or action. Ideophones are found in many of the world's [[language]]s, though they are claimed to be relatively uncommon in Western languages.&lt;ref&gt;Nuckolls 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  In many languages, they are a major lexical class of the same order of magnitude as nouns and verbs:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; dictionaries of languages like Japanese, Korean, and Zulu list thousands of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.lib.kobe-u.ac.jp/handle_gakui/D1004724|title=A Grammar of Sound-Symbolic Words in Japanese: Theoretical Approaches to Iconic and Lexical Properties of Japanese Mimetics|last=Akita|first=Kimi|publisher=Kobe University|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word class of ideophones is sometimes called ''phonosemantic'' to indicate that it is not a grammatical word class in the traditional sense of the word (like '[[verb]]' or '[[noun]]'), but rather a lexical class based on the special relation between form and meaning exhibited by ideophones. In the discipline of [[linguistics]], ideophones have long been overlooked or treated as mysterious words,&lt;ref&gt;Voeltz and Kilian-Hatz 2001:2&lt;/ref&gt; though a recent surge of interest in [[sound symbolism]], [[iconicity]] and linguistic diversity has brought them renewed attention.&lt;ref&gt;Imai &amp; Kita 2014, Dingemanse et al. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

An often-cited definition of the notion of ideophone is the following by [[Clement Martyn Doke]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Doke 1935 as cited in Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|A vivid representation of an idea in sound. A word, often onomatopoeic, which describes a predicate, qualificative or adverb in respect to manner, color, sound, smell, action, state or intensity.}}

Ideophones evoke sensory events. A well known instance of ideophones are [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] words ‚Äì words that imitate the sound (of the event) they refer to. Some ideophones may be derived from onomatopoeic notions. A case in point is the English ideophonic verb ''to tinkle'', which imitates a brief metallic sound. In many languages, however, ideophones go far beyond onomatopoeia in imitating many things beyond sound.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, in [[Gbaya languages|Gbaya]],  ''kpuk '''a rap on the door' may be onomatopoeic, but other ideophones depict motion and visual scenes: ''lo…ìoto-lo…ìoto'' 'large animals plodding through mud', ''kil√°≈ã-kil√°≈ã'' 'in a zigzagging motion', ''p…õ…ó…õ≈ã-p…õ…ó…õ≈ã'' 'razor sharp'.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Ideophones are often characterized as [[Iconicity|iconic]] or [[Sound symbolism|sound-symbolic]] words, meaning that there can be a resemblance between their form and their meaning. For instance, in West-African languages, voiced consonants and low tone in ideophones are often connected to large and heavy meanings, whereas voiceless consonants and high tones tend to relate to small and light things.&lt;ref&gt;Westermann 1927&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reduplication]] figures quite prominently in ideophones, often conveying a sense of repetition or plurality present in the evoked event.&lt;ref&gt;Watson in Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The iconicity of ideophones is shown by the fact that people can guess the meanings of ideophones from various languages at a level above chance.&lt;ref&gt;Iwasaki et al. 2007, Dingemanse et al. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; However, not everything about the form of ideophones directly relates to their meaning; as conventionalized words, they contain arbitrary, language-specific phonemes just like other parts of the vocabulary.

===Grammar===
The grammatical function of ideophones varies by language. In some languages (e.g. [[Welayta language|Welayta]], [[Yir-Yoront language|Yir-Yiront]], [[Semai language|Semai]], [[Korean language|Korean]]), they form a separate word class, while in others, they occur across a number of different word classes (e.g. [[Mundang]], [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Sotho language|Sotho]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]]).&lt;ref&gt;Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this diversity, ideophones show a number of robust regularities across languages. One is that they are often marked in the same way as quoted speech and demonstrations.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samarin|first=William J.|year=1971|title=Survey of Bantu ideophones|url=|journal=African Language Studies|volume=12|pages=130‚Äì168|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes ideophones can form a complete utterance on their own, as in English "ta-da!" or Japanese {{Nihongo||„Ç∏„É£„Éº„É≥|jaan|ta-da}}.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Diffloth 1972&lt;/ref&gt; However, ideophones also often occur within utterances, depicting a scene described by other elements of the utterance, as in Japanese ''Taro wa &lt;u&gt;sutasuta to&lt;/u&gt; haya-aruki o si-ta'' 'Taro walked hurriedly' (literally 'Taro did haste-walk ''sutasuta''&lt;nowiki/&gt;').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kita|first=Sotaro|year=1997|title=Two-dimensional semantic analysis of Japanese mimetics|url=|journal=Linguistics|volume=35|pages=379‚Äì415|via=|doi=10.1515/ling.1997.35.2.379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether they occur as part of other utterances or on their own, ideophones tend show a high degree of grammatical independence. They often occur at the edge of the utterance; they may be syntactically optional; and they tend to carry little inflectional or derivational morphology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other signs of their relative independence are that they are often produced with higher intonation and expressive lengthening, and set off from the rest of the utterance by a brief pause.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kunene in Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their relative independence, ideophones are sometimes compared to [[interjection]]s: direct expressions of emotions like "Wow!" or "Ouch!". However, they are distinct in a number of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ameka|first=Felix K.|year=1992|title=Interjections: the universal yet neglected part of speech|url=|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=18|pages=101‚Äì118|via=|doi=10.1016/0378-2166(92)90048-g}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas interjections usually occur on their own, ideophones more often modify other utterances, providing an illustration of a scene the utterance is about. Also, ideophones are more like illustrations ''of'' events than responses ''to'' events. An ideophone like Gbaya ''kil√°≈ã-kil√°≈ã'' 'in a zigzagging motion' displays a certain resemblance to the event (for instance, its irregular vowels and tones depicting the irregularity of the motion). An interjection like 'Wow!' indexes someone's response to an event but does not resemble that event itself.

===Registers===
Languages may differ in the context in which ideophones are used. In some languages, ideophones are primarily used in spoken language (e.g. [[narrative]] contexts) and are rarely encountered in written language.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Noss in Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In other languages (e.g. [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]]), ideophones can be freely used in all [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]]. In general, however, ideophones tend to occur more extensively in spoken language because of their expressive or dramaturgic function.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Examples==

===[[English language|English]]===

* ''boing''; the sound of a spring being released
* ''boom''; the sound of an explosion
* ''bang''; the sound of a gunshot
* ''[[bling-bling]]''; glitter, sparkle
* ''pitter-patter''; the sound of rain drops
* ''swish''; the sound of swift movement
* ''splish-splash''; the sound of water splashing
* ''ta-daa!''; the sound of a [[fanfare]]
* ''thud''; the sound of something heavy falling on the ground
* ''tick-tock''; the sound of time passing
* ''twinkle''; the glow of something sparkling or shiny

===[[Japanese language|Japanese]]===
{{main article|Japanese sound symbolism}}
The Japanese language has thousands of ideophones, often called ''mimetics''. The constructions are quite metrical 2-2, or 3-3, where [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]] play a role in the symmetry. The first consonant of the second item of the reduplication [[rendaku|may become voiced]] if phonological conditions allow. Japanese ideophones are used extensively in daily conversations as well as in the written language.

* ''doki doki'' ({{lang|ja|„Éâ„Ç≠„Éâ„Ç≠}}) &amp;mdash; heartbeat: excitement
* ''kira kira'' ({{lang|ja|„Ç≠„É©„Ç≠„É©}}) &amp;mdash; glitter
* ''shiin'' ({{lang|ja|„Ç∑„Éº„É≥}}) &amp;mdash; silence
* ''niko niko'' ({{lang|ja|„Éã„Ç≥„Éã„Ç≥}}) &amp;mdash; smile

[[File:raphides in idioblast.jpg |thumb|Calcium oxalate needles shot out from idioblast (600x magnification)]]

An '''idioblast''' is an isolated plant cell that differs from neighboring tissues. They have various functions such as storage of reserves, excretory materials, pigments, and minerals. They could contain oil, latex, gum, resin, tannin or pigments etc. Some can contain mineral crystals such as acrid tasting and poisonous [[calcium oxalate]] or carbonate or silica.   
Any of the tissue or tissue systems of plants can contain idioblasts.&lt;ref&gt;Sachs 1874. "Botany"&lt;/ref&gt; 
Idioblasts are divided into three main categories: excretory, tracheoid, and [[sclerenchyma]]tous.

Idioblasts can contain biforine cells that form crystals. The chemicals are excreted by the plant and stored in liquid or crystalline form. In bundles they are known as [[druse (botany)|druse]] and as crystals they can be of [[raphide]] [needle] form.  When the end of an idioblast is broken the crystals or other substance is ejected by internal water pressure.  Idioblasts of calcium oxalate may function as a deterrent to herbivores, as a means of sequestering or storing calcium, or as a means of stiffening tissue structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Diversity and distribution of idioblasts producing calcium oxalate crystals in ''Dieffenbachia seguine'' (Araceae) | author = Gary G.

==Branches==
There are currently three branches at several places in West Bengal where people working in different fields of astrophysics: Malda, Coochbehar, and Midnapore.

==Faculties and departments==
ICSP has four major departments working on several branches of astrophysics and related subjects.

===Instrumentation for Space Exploration===
Space exploration by means of balloon borne detectors is the main concern of this department. ICSP has pioneered in this field of low cost exploration of near earth space using light weight payloads on board weather balloons. In the course of the experiments ICSP payloads has visited the space more than 100 times and has gathered a multitude of data from extraterrestrial radiation sources, atmospheric radiation data due to cosmic ray interactions and other atmospheric data. These data has provided new understandings about the cosmic radiation sources as well as the radiation effects on the earth atmosphere.

===Astrochemistry and astrobiology===

===Ionospheric sciences===
The main research activities of this department includes study on solar-terrestrial environment including solar disturbances, Earth‚Äôs magnetosphere, ionosphere, thermosphere, lithosphere, atmosphere etc. Peoples also work on seismo-ionospheric precursors, lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling processes, long-term and transient solar activity and ionospheric climatology using both ground and space based VLF receiver. Monitoring of galactic X-ray transients, Soft Gamma ray Repeaters (SGRs) and Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) etc. are also active research topic in this department.

===High energy astrophysics===
This department mainly deals with Black Hole astrophysics. There are two branches of black hole astrophysics: Theoretical and Observational.

==Activities and collaborations==
ICSP is collaborating with several national and international institutions and universities. It is a member of Erasmus Mundus joint PhD programme in astronomy funded by European Union. Several of its scientists have been trained at [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics|ICTP]] (The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics), Italy. Scientist from ICSP has been taken part in the Antarctica expeditions. In the balloon borne science mission, this institute has been visited the near space for more than 100 times.

{{for|the film|Intermedio (film)}}

The '''intermedio''' {{IPA-it|interÀàm…õÀêdjo|}} (also '''intromessa''', '''introdutto''', '''tramessa''', '''tramezzo''', '''intermezzo'''), in the [[Italian Renaissance]], was a theatrical  performance or spectacle with [[Renaissance music|music]] and often dance which was performed between the acts of a play to celebrate special occasions in Italian [[noble court|courts]].  It was one of the important predecessors to [[opera]], and an influence on other forms like the English court [[masque]].  Weddings in ruling families and similar state occasions were the usual occasion for the most lavish intermedi, in cities such as [[Florence]] and [[Ferrara]].  Some of the best documentation of intermedi comes from weddings in the [[Medici]] family, in particular the 1589 Medici wedding (between [[Christina, Grand Duchess of Tuscany|Christina of Lorraine]] and [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]]), which featured what was undoubtedly both the most spectacular set of intermedi, and the best known, thanks to no fewer than 18 contemporary published festival books and sets of [[old master print|prints]] that were financed by the Grand Duke.&lt;ref&gt;Reed &amp; Wallace:205-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Intermedi were written and performed from the late 15th century through the 17th century, although the peak of development of the genre was in the late 16th century.  After 1600 the form merged with opera, for the most part, though intermedi continued to be used in non-musical plays in certain settings (for example in academies), and also continued to be performed between the acts of operas.

==Development==
The first intermedii were  not in Florence but in [[Ferrara]] at the end of the 15th century between the five acts of plays by the classical authors [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]]. Writing of the "intermezzi" at the wedding of [[Lucrezia Borgia]] in 1502, [[Isabella d'Este]] said that they were more interesting than the boring ''commedia'', "a remark destined to be often repeated".&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 105&lt;/ref&gt;  Ferrara intermezzi at this period were short and without a unifying theme; they included choruses, recitations and ''[[moresca]]'' dances.  But by 1513 there was a unifying [[allegory]], explained at the end.  It was for Florentine public celebrations that Intermedii came into their own; several were organised by [[Machiavelli]] when he was part of the government of the [[Republic of Florence]] in the early 16th century, and the returning Medici adopted a policy of keeping the aristocracy occupied by involving them in productions.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 105&lt;/ref&gt;

As the intermedio developed in the 16th century, it grew more and more elaborate, often becoming a "play within a play"; for example during a five-act play, an intermedio would consist of four parts, which might be presented as a four-part metaphor of time passing in the play.  This stage begins with ''Il commodo'', from the Medici wedding in [[Florence]] of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I]] and [[Eleanor of Toledo]] in 1539,&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0189 Festival Book online]&lt;/ref&gt; where the four parts were morning, noon, afternoon, and night, represented with an elaborate mechanical artificial sun, with singing and dancing appropriate to each time.  Some critics of the time noted that the intermedi had become so elaborate that the play had begun to serve as intermedi to the intermedi.

==Mature intermedio==
Originally intermedi had used the sets already on the stage from the main play, typically fairly simple ones for a comedy, with a few extra pieces, but later they had their own sets, which a mythological subject required to be more elaborate.  [[Vasari]]'s production for yet another Medici wedding in 1565 "embodied stupendous advances in engineering technique" with all the elaborate movements of scenery done without a curtain in full view of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Strong:134-6&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Roy Strong]]: "the designs for the 1589 intermezzi are crucial, for they are the earliest mass-disseminated illustrations of what became a norm throughout Europe for theatrical visual experience for the next three hundred years, the [[proscenium arch]] behind which receded ranks of side wings, the vista closed by a back-shutter."&lt;ref&gt;Strong:140&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the form acquired a tradition and cohesiveness that allowed it to stand on its own, and it was thus a logical development to combine the existing features with sung, acted parts, and be absorbed into the new artform of opera, which also drew from the traditions of [[monody]] and [[madrigal comedy]]. [[Jacopo Peri]], the composer of [[Dafne]], the first opera, was one of the composers, and almost certainly performers, in the 1589 Medici intermezzi, and the librettist for both, [[Ottavio Rinuccini]], seems to have recycled in ''Dafne'' some of the material from the 1589 Delos scene (illustrated at top).
[[Image:La pellegrina 1589 - Intermedio 6 - La discesa d‚ÄôApollo e Bacco col Ritmo e l‚ÄôArmonia.jpg|left|thumb|Another of the 1589 intermedi; 6th intermedio: Apollo and Bacchus descend, accompanied by Harmony, Rhythm, the [[Charites|Three Graces]], Flora and others.]]
"Festival books", produced as souvenirs of lavish festivities, contain detailed descriptions of many important intermedi, such as those for the Medici wedding of 1589,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ursusbooks.com/item110358.html Album of engravings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717175205/http://www.ursusbooks.com/item110358.html |date=2011-07-17 }}, showing several of the sets.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0205 British Library festival book online text]&lt;/ref&gt; for which 286 costumes were made.  Although music written specially for this occasion survives (see discography below), this is usually not the case, and music written for other occasions, for example [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s and instrumental pieces, was often used in intermedi.  The subject matter of the intermedio was usually a [[mythology|mythological]] or [[pastoral]] story, which could be told in [[mime artist|mime]], by costumed singers or actors, or by [[dance]], or any combination of these.  There was invariably a political message, even if this was limited to general glorification of the ruling family; at times more specific messages were intended.  Some thematic connection with the main play might be made, though intermedii could be repeated with different plays from the one they were written for.  

Numerous drawings and engravings of the stage sets survive, as well as texts of the libretti and descriptions of the music and action; the 1589 Medici intermezzi were especially well recorded, and "were to be the fount of Italian [[baroque]] scenography as well as influencing the development of the stage north of the Alps, above all the Stuart court [[masque]]s designed by [[Inigo Jones]]".&lt;ref&gt;Strong:136&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual content in terms of staging, music, instrumentation, presence of singers, actors, dancers, or mime was highly variable throughout the period, and sometimes all of these features were present.  The 1589 intermedi were performed in the recently completed theatre in the [[Uffizi Palace]] before an audience of about three thousand, and three further performances were given some days after the end of the wedding festivities. 
Further significant sets of Medici intermedi were produced for the weddings in 1600 of [[Henry IV of France]] and [[Marie de' Medici]], and then in 1608 of [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke Cosimo II]] and a [[Habsburg]] princess, [[Archduchess Maria Maddalena of Austria|Maria Magdalena of Austria]]. However the 1600 celebrations also included a portent of things to come in the form of performances of [[Jacopo Peri]]'s opera ''[[Euridice (opera)|Euridice]]'', the earliest surviving example of the form.

==Music of the Medici intermedi==
[[Image:La pellegrina 1589 - Intermedio 1 - L'armonia delle sfere.jpg|thumb|Another of the 1589 intermedi: number 1: Harmony descends to earth]]
Of the various intermedi that were performed, only the music to some parts of ''Il commodo''  (1539) and, through a 1591 printed edition by [[Cristofano Malvezzi]], an almost complete version of ''[[The Pilgrim Woman|La Pellegrina]]'' (1589) are known to have survived.&lt;ref&gt;liner noters to Semp√©, "La Pellegrina", 30&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1539 most of the pieces are in four and five parts so much of this music is suitable for domestic playing. The 1589 music is very different being largely big set pieces for 6, 12, 18 or even 30 parts; 41 instrumentalists were required in all, some hidden around the stage as there was not room for them all in one place.&lt;ref&gt;Grout and Williams, 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Smaller scale pieces are often difficult florid [[monody]] of the [[Giulio Caccini|Caccini]] ''new music'' variety.

Of the surviving intermedi only two numbers were ''[[a cappella]]'', (not counting the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s which were sung at the banquet in 1539 which of course are not intermedi).  This means we have surviving descriptions of precise instrumentation.

Classical humanist dramatic theory says a play should have action taking place during one entire day.  These intermedi do not follow what were believed to be the classical instructions, having an overture item, ''Vattene almo riposo'', and a night time ending for tenor voice accompanied by four [[sackbut]]s and an extra [[coda (music)|coda]] the [[bacchanale]], ''Baccho, Baccho, E U O E''.

==Similar forms outside Italy==

The similar form which developed in France at the same time was called the [[interm√®de]]; it was more reliant on dance than the Italian version.  The French court under [[Catherine de' Medici]] was also staging [[Catherine de' Medici's court festivals|court festivities of increasing lavishness]] ‚Äì Catherine's granddaughter was the Medici bride in 1589.  The [[masque]] in England also had many similarities to the intermedio, although it did not originate as a "filler" between acts in a play in the same way.  The later 18th century [[intermezzo]] in opera showed a reversal of the Renaissance scheme; now a single short comic intermezzo was inserted between the acts of a heroic [[opera seria]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2927">'''Legal syllogism''' is a legal concept concerning the law and its application. It is based upon deductive reasoning applied for the sake of law, hence it is also called '''legal deduction''' or '''deductive legal reasoning'''.

In legal syllogism there are two premises, minor and major, and one conclusion.

The place of the major premise is taken by a legal norm (or rule). This norm (rule) may be derived from canonical text (text of statutes, constitutions, regulations, international treaties and agreements, ordinances, bylaws etc) or from a judicial precedent. In the latter case, it can be called ''[[ratio decidendi]]'' or ruling. In the main, it can be considered as a general expression which, in generic terms, states what one ought to do or ought not to do in a certain type of circumstances. 

The facts of the case at hand (also called pending, instant, ''[[sub judice]]'', at bar or under argument) serve as the minor premise. These facts may be understood as all elements of the factual setting of the case at hand, i.e. the details of the events, things and persons which occurred in a case to which the rule/norm that constitutes the major premise is to be applied deductively.

The conclusion is formed by the legal consequence for the case at hand.

If the norm that forms the major premise is valid (binding in a given legal system) and the facts of the case at hand are proven or posited as true, the conclusion of legal syllogism which flows from subsuming these facts under this norm (rule) is supposed to be correct as well.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, "Legal Analogy as an Alternative to the Deductive Mode of Legal Reasoning." The Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law no 1/2017: 74‚Äì76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, "Intricacies, Fallacy and Madness of Legal Deduction." Archiv f√ºr Rechts- und Sozialphilosophie no. 4/2017: 495-496.&lt;/ref&gt;

In that sense, legal syllogism can be deemed to be equally infallible  as 'ordinary' ('logical') [[syllogism]]. Such a claim is, however, ill-founded and, in fact, subsumption of a concrete case under a general rule proves to be a value-laden and goal-oriented process. Neither is it 'logical', nor 'mechanical'.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, "Legal Analogy as an Alternative to the Deductive Mode of Legal Reasoning."

{{other uses|Madi (disambiguation)}}

'''Mad√≠''' (or MADI; also known as Grupo Mad√≠ or Arte Mad√≠) is an international abstract (or concrete) art movement initiated in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1946 by the Hungarian-Argentinian artist and poet [[Gyula Kosice]], and the Uruguayans [[Carmelo Arden Quin]] and [[Rhod Rothfuss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Made in Mad√≠: Nelson Di Maggio, curador de retrospectiva sobre Carmelo Arden Quin|url=http://ladiaria.com.uy/articulo/2010/11/made-in-madi/|publisher=La Diaria|accessdate=14 June 2012|author=Riccardo Boglione|date=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement focuses on creating [[concrete art]] (i.e., non-representational [[geometric abstraction]]) and encompasses all branches of art (the plastic and pictorial arts, music, literature, theater, architecture, dance, etc.). The artists in the Mad√≠ movement consider the concrete, physical reality of the art medium and play with the traditional conventions of [[Western art history|Western art]] (for instance, by creating works on irregularly-shaped canvases).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1193621/Concrete-Invention "Concrete Invention."] ''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online''. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2010. Web. 30 Dec. 2010. &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1193621/Concrete-Invention&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Artwork of Mad√≠ movement appeared in eight issues of its magazine, ''[[Arte Mad√≠ Universal]]'', published between 1947 and 1954.

== Historical Context ==
The Mad√≠ art movement formed as a reaction to the major concrete art movement in Argentina at the time, known as the [[Asociaci√≥n Arte Concreto-Invenci√≥n]] (AACI), whose art was perceived by the Mad√≠ group as being too strict in their method of creating concrete art, resulting in a lack of expression in their artworks. 

Operating under the rule of Colonel [[Juan Per√≥n|Per√≥n]], whose time in power was characterized by a volatile political climate, the Mad√≠ artists used their art to make statements with social and political implications. One of the most overt criticisms made by the Mad√≠ movement criticized cultural authorities in the ''[[Arte Mad√≠ Universal]]'' magazine'','' commenting "[t]he last submission to the Venice Biennial has signified for Argentina a blunt negation of the new [artistic] values. We invite competent authorities to stop and compare the true current of contemporary plastic arts with the submissions that today put us [our country] half a century behind", which vaguely attack the aesthetic choices of certain cultural officers under Per√≥n. According to [[P√©rez-Barreiro]], Mad√≠ and Concrete art (referring to the [[Asociaci√≥n Arte Concreto-Invenci√≥n]] (AACI)) are the artistic parallel(s) of the political phenomenon of [[Peronism]]. These artists were also seen as combining modern art with Communist ideology. Some scholars, including Barreiro, saw the government was an outspoken critic against concrete art as a whole, whereas others such as [[Andrea Giunta]] assert that the Mad√≠ and Concrete groups were not victimized under Per√≥n's regime; rather, they "coexisted on its margins".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The political regime of Per√≥n made use of both linguistic and visual images for propaganda purposes. This is seen in his use of an image, "the shirtless workers" (los descamisados), as an alternative to the concept of the working class. This image had strong connections and connotations with the male worker, shirtless and, unrealistically, without much affliction. In a speech given October 17th, 1946 at Plaza de Mayo, Per√≥n addressed the workers in speeches as "mis queridos descamisados" (my loving shirtless workers). At this speech, he declared October 17th the "Day of the Shirtless Workers" and stated "I don‚Äôt want to govern over men but over their hearts, because mine beats in unison with the heart of each shirtless worker, which I interpret and love above all things.‚Äù The use of representations to create propaganda opened up a clear target for the Mad√≠ artists to oppose.

== Origin of the name ==
Gyula Kosice, who also operated under the pseudonym Raymundo Rasas P√®t, has explained that the name for the movement is derived from the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] motto in the [[Spanish Civil War]], "''Madr√≠, Madr√≠, no pasar√°n''" ("Madrid, Madrid, they will not make it in", i.e., the [[Francisco Franco|Francoist forces]] will not invade Madrid).&lt;ref&gt;[http://misitio.fibertel.com.ar/niusletercultura/Content40181.shtml "Entrevista a Gyula Kosice"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120629170755/http://misitio.fibertel.com.ar/niusletercultura/Content40181.shtml |date=29 June 2012 }}, ''√ëusleter Cultura'', 12 de agosto de 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is most typically understood as an acronym for ''Movimiento, Abstracci√≥n, Dimensi√≥n, Invenci√≥n'' (Movement, Abstraction, Dimension, Invention).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Characteristics ==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}
A Mad√≠ work is non-figurative and non-representational; it has a cut-out or irregularly-shaped form, which takes away the viewer's perception of spatial depth that a rectangular frame provides; its colors are flat and sharply defined; it is often three-dimensional and sometimes articulated and/or mechanical; and it is playful in spirit. Mad√≠ artists were concerned with creating artworks that were autonomous with functions that naturally transcend the physical features that constitute the work. Introducing elements of transformation and ambiguity were techniques commonly employed by these artists to avoid representation as well as avoid the fixity of representations. In painted works, some artists would intentionally lower the legibility of the design.

The incorporation of unusual materials into artworks is seen throughout the art movement movement; this includes Plexiglas, fluorescent tubes, neon lights, water, metal, and other materials. An example of this is seen in [[Gyula Kosice|Kosice's]] first hydraulic piece, ''La arquitectura del agua: Hidro-escultura (The Architecture of Water: Hydro-Sculpture)'', which utilized light and water interaction.

Mad√≠ artists sought to combat representational forms because this art reflected and perpetuated class-based social organizations. They believed that representational images "forced others to relate to concepts, connotations, and feelings which were superfluous to the object itself... which enticed individuals into supporting class-based organizations". The Concrete art they produced was meant to have a reality that was self-contained. In other words, the reality of the art ended in the object. In the minds of the Mad√≠ artists, "Concrete art was worthy as a contribution to social liberation" because it helped its audience grasp true reality while standing against the concepts, connotations and feelings associated with art. To state this differently, exposing people to what is actually reality allows people to eventually confront myths perpetuated by the bourgeois that has suppressed revolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Mad√≠ is perhaps the sole remaining art movement which can boast of a half-century of uninterrupted activity since its creation in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1946. Today, the MADI movement has over 60 members ‚Äî painters, sculptors, architects and poets ‚Äî working in France, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Hungary, Japan, [[Argentina]] and the United States. One prominent figure behind this fifty years of artistic creation is [[Carmelo Arden Quin]].

== The Mad√≠ Manifesto ==
The Mad√≠ Manifesto was created to defend the importance of invention in the light of limitations imposed on concrete art by the excessive rationalism of European concrete art. This strictness of form in concrete art was also demonstrated by the [[Asociaci√≥n Arte Concreto-Invenci√≥n]] (AACI). The manifesto also called for "the integration of the nonorthogonal framework into representational space".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geometric Abstraction: Latin American Art from the Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Collection|last=Bois|first=Yve-Alan|publisher=Harvard University Art Museums|year=2001|isbn=|location=Massachusetts|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mad√≠ Dictionary ==
In written works, artists "disrupted the construction of semantically coherent structures" to avoid attaching meaning to the art and the possibility of representation. The Mad√≠ created a dictionary that accomplished the opposite of what a normal dictionary does in that it confused and distorted the meanings of words and made up words. The following excerpt is from the Mad√≠ dictionary, which demonstrates a correct grammatical structure that relates ideas that are impossible to interpret meaningfully.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is an example of this incoherent construction which prevents interpretation:&lt;blockquote&gt;M¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Maclode: Upward hill. / Slope to insinuate land.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Meril: Kidnapping of flat centimeters. / ''Mad√≠cional'' [‚ÄòMad√≠-like‚Äô or ‚Äòof Mad√≠ origin‚Äô] opposition and resistance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Miogue: Account of events in which the authors of great answers participated.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Molois: Site where the most varied adjectives are collected. / ''Fam''. Insult.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Musver: About the manner to focus in photography the liveliest glare of a childhood memory. / Fixation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Macichud: Line of shade that emits a loosening of gray beams.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;N&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nandy: Arrangement for new personal cu√±o.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nem-Er: Record of instances.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nigs: Opening that is left so that a cluster of enchanted powder emigrates.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Novoh: Shooter that the riverside authority exercises to learn the coastal ruling&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Selected Artists and Artworks ==
Representatives of the Mad√≠ movement, in addition to Kosice, Quin and Rothfuss, include [[Mart√≠n Blaszko]], [[Waldo Longo]], [[Juan Bay]], [[Esteban Eitler]], [[Diyi Laa√±]], and [[Valdo Wellington]], among others.

== Why MADI? ==
To the question, "Why MADI?" Josee Lapeyrere, who met Arden Quin in 1962 and has since participated with her poem-objects in most of the events organized by the movement, replies: "MADI's goal is to be rigorous, inventive, gay and ludic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=MADI internacional 50 a√±os despu√©s: exposici√≥n del 7 de marzo al 3 de abril de 1996, Centro de Exposiciones y Congresos, Zaragoza|last=Osornio|first=Cesar Lopez|last2=Roitman|first2=Ibercaja|publisher=Ibercaja|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the importance to which they accord spiritual and imaginative games, even the most serious MADI artists can be described as playful. Already in 1795, Schiller focused on "the inborn playful nature of man" as an explanation for his production of art forms. In his essay, "[[Homo Ludens]]" ("Ludic Man") (1938), [[Johan Huizinga]] observed that, "Play reveals an aspiration to beauty. The terms we use to designate the elements of play are, for the most part, the same as those utilized in the aesthetic realm: beauty, tension, balancing, equilibrium, gradation, contrast, etc. Like art, play engages and delivers. It absorbs. It captivates, or, in other words, it charms. It is full of those two supremely noble qualities which man expresses through rhythm and harmony." The French art critic [[Dominique Jacquemin]] also remarks that, "It is possible that Arden Quin's passion for game playing led him to create MADI, the only remaining contemporary art movement which can pride itself in possessing both coherence and a truly international outlook."

Commercially available [[microdialysis]] probes typically have molecular weight cutoffs that range from 1,000 to 300,000&amp;nbsp;Da, and larger thresholds of filtration are measured in [[¬µm]].

Microdialysis may also be used to separate [[nanoparticle]]s from the solutions in which they were formed. In such a separation, the eluate will consist of non-complexed reactants and components.

{{canon law}}
In the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Catholic Church]], '''obrogation''' is the enacting of a contrary law that is a revocation of a previous law.&lt;ref&gt;Della Rocca, ''Manual'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be the partial cancellation or amendment of a law, decree, or legal regulation by the imposition of a newer one.

==Obrogation==
In the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], obrogation is the modification or repeal of a law in whole or in part by issuing a new law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Obrogate |work=[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] |publisher=Merriam-Webster.com. |accessdate=March 24, 2016 |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/obrogate}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=obrogate |work=[[Black's Law Dictionary]] |edition=7th |page=1104 |first1=Bryan A. |last1=Garner |authorlink1=Bryan A.

'''''Opus craticum''''' or ''craticii'' is an [[ancient Roman]] construction technique described by [[Vitruvius]] in his books ''[[De architectura]]'' as [[Wattle and daub|wattlework]] which is plastered over. Vitruvius disparaged this building technique as a grave fire risk, likely to have cracked plaster, and not durable.&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius, De Architectura, Book II, Chapter 8, paragraph 20. http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/2*.html#8.20&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving examples were found in the archaeological excavations at [[Pompeii]] and more so at [[Herculaneum]], buried by the eruption of [[Mt. Vesuvius]] in 79 AD and excavated beginning in 1929. Scholarly confusion exists&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich, Roger Bradley. Roman woodworking. New Haven [CT: Yale University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam, Jean Pierre. Roman building: materials and techniques. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1994. 239, photo shows wall with a caption naming the wall as ''opus craticium'' with an infill of ''opus incertum''&lt;/ref&gt; and the term ''opus craticium'' is also used for the Roman building technique very similar, but not identified as being directly related to [[Timber framing|half-timbering]], a timber framework with the wall [[infill]] of stones in mortar called ''[[opus incertum]]''. An example of this technique is the House of Opus Craticum in Herculaneum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/ad79eruption/herculaneum-1/insula-iii-2/house-of-the-opus-craticium |title=House of the Opus Craticium|accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a reconstruction of the original building.

Before the Romans, the Minoans, Etruscans, and Greeks are known to have used similar building techniques. At least since the 13th century, this type of construction, common in Europe, was called half-timbered in English, ''Fachwerk'' (framework) in German, ''entramado de madera'' in Spanish, and ''colombage'' in French.

'''Philosophy of history''' is the philosophical study of [[history]] and the past. The term was coined by [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Voltaire]], ''La philosophie de l'histoire'', Changuion, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
In [[contemporary philosophy]] a distinction is made between critical philosophy of history (also known as analytic) and speculative philosophy of history. The names of these types are derived from [[C. D. Broad]]'s distinction between [[critical philosophy]] and [[speculative philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g. W. H. Walsh, ''Introduction to the Philosophy of History'' (1951) ch. 1 p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Gruner, "The concept of speculative philosophy of history," ''Metaphilosophy'' '''3'''(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

The former studies the past itself whereas the latter is the equivalent of what the [[philosophy of science]] is for nature.&lt;ref&gt;The Continuing Relevance of Speculative Philosophy of History, Journal of the Philosophy of History&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philosophy of History, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there is some overlap between the two aspects, they can usually be distinguished; modern professional historians tend to be skeptical about speculative philosophy of history.

Sometimes critical philosophy of history is included under [[historiography]]. Philosophy of history should not be confused with the [[history of philosophy]], which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas in their historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/stefan-collini/what-intellectual-history|title=What is Intellectual History?|work=historytoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-modern history==
In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] (384‚Äì322 BCE) maintained the superiority of poetry over history because poetry speaks of what ''must'' or ''should'' be [[truth|true]] rather than merely what ''is'' true.

[[Herodotus]], a fifth-century BCE contemporary of [[Socrates]], broke from the [[Homer|Homeric tradition]] of passing [[narrative]] from generation to generation in his work "Investigations" (Ancient Greek: ·ºπœÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ±Œπ; Istor√≠ai), also known as [[Histories (Herodotus)|''Histories'']]. Herodotus, regarded by some{{who|date=June 2016}} as the first systematic historian, and, later, [[Plutarch]] (46‚Äì120 CE) freely invented [[discourse|speeches]] for their historical figures and chose their historical subjects with an eye toward [[moral]]ly improving the reader. History was supposed to teach good examples for one to follow. The assumption that history "should teach good examples" influenced how writers produced history. Events of the past are just as likely to show bad examples that one should not follow, but classical historians would either not record such examples or would re-interpret them to support their assumption of history's purpose.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

From the Classical period to the [[Renaissance]], historians alternated between focusing on subjects designed to improve mankind and on a devotion to fact. History was composed mainly of [[hagiography|hagiographies]] of [[sovereignty|monarchs]] or of [[epic poetry]] describing [[hero]]ic gestures (such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]''‚Äîabout the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] (778) during [[Charlemagne]]'s first campaign to conquer the [[Iberian peninsula]]).

In the fourteenth century, [[Ibn Khaldun]], who is considered one of the fathers of the philosophy of history, discussed his philosophy of history and society in detail in his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377). His work represents a culmination of earlier works by [[Social theory#Sociology in medieval Islam|medieval Islamic sociologists]] in the spheres of [[Islamic ethics]], [[political science]], and [[Historiography of early Islam|historiography]], such as those of [[al-Farabi]] (c. 872 ‚Äì c. 950), [[Ibn Miskawayh]], al-Dawani, and [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] (1201‚Äì1274).&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data". He introduced a [[scientific method]] to the philosophy of history (which Dawood considers something "totally new to his age") and he often referred to it as his "new science",&lt;ref&gt;

which is now associated with [[historiography]]. His [[historical method]] also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of the [[State (polity)|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]], and [[systematic bias]] in history.&lt;ref name=Mowlana/&gt;

By the eighteenth century historians had turned toward a more [[positivist]] approach‚Äîfocusing on [[fact]] as much as possible, but still with an eye on telling histories that could instruct and improve. Starting with [[Fustel de Coulanges]] (1830‚Äì1889) and [[Theodor Mommsen]] (1817‚Äì1903), historical studies began to move towards a more modern scientific{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} form. In the [[Victorian era]], historiographers debated less whether history was intended to improve the [[Reading (process)|reader]], and more on what causes turned history and how one could understand historical change.

==Cyclical and linear history==
{{further information|Social cycle theory}}

Narrative history tends to follow an assumption of linear progression: "this happened, and then that happened; that happened because this happened first".

Many ancient cultures held [[Religion and mythology|mythical]] concepts of history and of [[time]] that were not [[linear]]. Such societies saw history as cyclical, with alternating Dark and Golden Ages. [[Plato]] taught the concept of the [[Great Year]], and other Greeks spoke of [[aeon]]s (eons). Similar examples include the ancient doctrine of [[eternal return]], which existed in [[Ancient Egypt]], in the [[Indian religions]], among the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Pythagoreans]]' and in the [[Stoics]]' conceptions. In his ''[[Works and Days]]'', [[Hesiod]] described five [[Ages of Man]]: the [[Golden Age]], the [[Silver Age]], the [[Bronze Age]], the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]], and the [[Iron Age]], which began with the [[Dorian invasion]]. Some scholars{{which?|date=July 2018}} identify just four ages, corresponding to the four metals, with the Heroic age as a description of the Bronze Age. A four-age count would match the [[Vedic time keeping|Vedic]] or Hindu ages known as the [[Kali Yuga|Kali]], [[Dwapara Yuga|Dwapara]], [[Treta Yuga|Treta]] and [[Satya Yuga|Satya]] [[yuga]]s. According to [[Jainism]], this world has no beginning or end but goes through cycles of upturns (utsarpini) and downturns (avasarpini) constantly. Many Greeks believed that just as mankind went through four [[stages of character]] during each rise and fall of history so did [[government]]. They considered [[democracy]] and [[monarchy]] as the healthy r√©gimes of the higher ages; and [[oligarchy]] and [[tyranny]] as corrupted r√©gimes common to the lower ages.{{citation needed|date= February 2016}}

In the East, [[Social cycle theory|cyclical theories of history]] developed in China (as a theory of [[dynastic cycle]]) and in the Islamic world in the work of [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332-1406).

The story of [[the Fall of Man]] from the [[Garden of Eden]], as recounted and elaborated in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], preserves traces of a moral cycle; this would give the basis for [[theodicy|theodicies]] which attempt to reconcile the existence of evil in the world with the existence of a God, providing a global explanation of history with belief in a coming [[Messianic Age]]. Some theodicies claimed that history had a progressive direction leading to an [[eschatological]] end, such as the [[Apocalypse]], organized by a superior power. [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430), [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225-1274) and [[Jacques-B√©nigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] (in his ''Discourse On [[Universal History]]'' of 1679) formulated such theodicies, but [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] (1646-1716), who coined the term ''Th√©odic√©e'', developed the most famous philosophical theodicy. Leibniz based his explanation on the [[principle of sufficient reason]], which states that anything that happens, does happen for a specific reason. Thus, while man might see certain events as evil (such as wars, epidemics and natural disasters), such a judgement in fact only reflected human perception; if one adopted [[God's view]], "evil" events in fact only took place in the larger [[divine plan]]. In this way theodicies explained the necessity of evil as a relative element that forms part of a larger plan of history. Leibniz's principle of sufficient reason was not, however, a gesture of [[fatalism]]. Confronted with the antique [[problem of future contingents]], Leibniz invented the theory of "[[compossible worlds]]", distinguishing two types of necessity, to cope with the problem of [[determinism]].

During the [[Renaissance]], cyclical conceptions of history would become common, with proponents illustrating decay and rebirth by pointing to the [[decline of the Roman Empire]]. [[Machiavelli]]'s ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'' (1513‚Äì1517) provide an example. The notion of [[Empire]] contained in itself ascendance and [[decadence]],{{cn|date=July 2018}} as in [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776) (which the Roman Catholic Church placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'').

[[Social cycle theory|Cyclical conceptions]] continued in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in the works of authors such as [[Oswald Spengler]] (1880‚Äì1936), [[Nikolay Danilevsky]] (1822‚Äì1885), and [[Paul Kennedy]] (1945‚Äì ), who conceived the human past as a series of repetitive rises and falls. Spengler, like [[Herbert Butterfield| Butterfield]], when writing in reaction to the carnage of the [[First World War]] of 1914‚Äì1918, believed that a civilization enters upon an era of [[Caesarism]]&lt;ref&gt;
Compare [https://books.google.com/books?id=XDWcLHxfthMC Oswald Spengler and History as Destiny], page 93: "[...] the closing years of the First World War, when Spengler was completing his work, had witnessed the passing of the feudal rule of landed aristocracy in Germany and its merging into budding forms of parliamentary plutocracy - soon to be followed by the rise of 'mobocracy' and then Caesarism."
&lt;/ref&gt;
after its soul dies.{{citation needed|date= February 2016}} Spengler thought that the soul of the West was dead and that Caesarism was about to begin.

The development of mathematical models of long-term secular sociodemographic cycles revived interest in cyclical theories of history (see, for example, ''Historical Dynamics'' (2003) by [[Peter Turchin]], or ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics''&lt;ref&gt;

==Sustainable history==
''"Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man"'' is a philosophy of history proposed by [[Nayef Al-Rodhan]], where history is defined as ''a durable progressive trajectory in which the quality of life on this planet or all other planets is premised on the guarantee of human dignity for all at all times under all circumstances.''&lt;ref&gt;Nayef R.F. Al-Rodhan, Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man: A Philosophy of History and Civilisational Triumph (Berlin: [http://www.lit-verlag.de/isbn/3-643-80005-3 LIT], 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; This theory views history as a linear progression propelled by [[good governance]], which is, in turn, to be achieved through balancing the emotional, amoral, and egoistic elements of [[human nature]] with the human dignity needs of reason, security, [[human rights]], accountability, transparency, justice, opportunity, innovation, and inclusiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcsp.ch/Globalisation/Publications/Faculty-Publications/Books-and-Edited-Volumes/Sustainable-History-and-the-Dignity-of-Man-A-Philosophy-of-History-and-Civilisational-Triumph GCSP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314154010/http://www.gcsp.ch/Globalisation/Publications/Faculty-Publications/Books-and-Edited-Volumes/Sustainable-History-and-the-Dignity-of-Man-A-Philosophy-of-History-and-Civilisational-Triumph |date=2012-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Human dignity'' lies at the heart of this theory and is paramount for ensuring the sustainable history of humankind. Among other things, [[human dignity]] means having a positive sense of self and instilling individuals with respect for the communities to which they belong. Thus, reconciling humans' predisposition for emotionally self-interested behavior with the imperatives of human dignity appears as the one of the most important challenges to global policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressclub.ch/menu/events/event_060710_1130.htm Geneva Press Club] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003094748/http://www.pressclub.ch/menu/events/event_060710_1130.htm |date=2011-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At national level, they have to protect their citizens against violence and provide them with access to food, housing, clothes, health care, and education. Basic welfare provision and security are fundamental to ensuring human dignity. Environment and ecological considerations need to be addressed as well. Finally, cultural diversity, inclusiveness and participation at all levels, of all communities are key imperatives of human dignity.

In this respect, the sustainable history philosophy challenges existing concepts of [[civilisations]], such as [[Samuel Huntington (political scientist)|Samuel Huntington's]] ''[[Clash of Civilisations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookpleasures.com/websitepublisher/articles/2610/1/-Sustainable-History-and-the-Dignity-of-Man-Reviewed-By-Norm-Goldman-of-Bookpleasurescom/Page1.html|title=Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man Reviewed By Norm Goldman of Bookpleasures.com|work=bookpleasures.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it argues that human civilisation should not be thought of as consisting of numerous separate and competing civilisations, but rather it should be thought of collectively as only one human civilisation. Within this civilisation are many geo-cultural domains that comprise'' [[sub-cultures]]. ''[[Nayef Al-Rodhan]]'' ''envisions human civilisation as an ocean into which the different geo-cultural domains flow like rivers,'' "The Ocean Model of one Human Civilization". ''At points where geo-cultural domains first enter the ocean of human civilisation, there is likely to be a concentration or dominance of that culture. However, over time, all the rivers of geo-cultural domains become one. There is fluidity at the ocean's centre and cultures have the opportunity to borrow between them. Under such historical conditions the most advanced forms of human enterprise can thrive and lead us to a'' 'civilisational triumph'. ''Nevertheless, there are cases where geographical proximity of various cultures can also lead to friction and conflict.

[[Nayef Al-Rodhan]] concludes that within an increasingly globalised, interconnected and interdependent world, human dignity cannot be ensured globally and in a sustainable way through sole national means. A genuine global effort is required to meet the minimum criteria of human dignity globally. Areas such as conflict prevention, socio-economic justice, gender equality, protection of human rights, environmental protection require a holistic approach and a common action.

During the ''Aufkl√§rung'', or Enlightenment, history began to be seen as both linear and irreversible. [[Condorcet]]'s interpretations of the various "stages of humanity" or [[Auguste Comte]]'s [[positivism]] were one of the most important formulations of such conceptions of history, which trusted [[social progress]]. As in [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'' (1762) treatise on education (or the "art of training men"), the ''Aufkl√§rung'' conceived the human species as perfectible: [[human nature]] could be infinitely developed through a well-thought [[pedagogy]]. In ''[[What is Enlightenment?]]'' (1784), [[Immanuel Kant]] defined the ''Aufkl√§rung'' as the capacity to think by oneself, without referring to an exterior authority, be it a prince or tradition:

{{quotation|Enlightenment is when a person leaves behind a state of immaturity and dependence (''Unm√ºndigkeit'') for which they themselves were responsible. Immaturity and dependence are the inability to use one's own [[intellect]] without the direction of another. One is responsible for this immaturity and dependence, if its cause is not a lack of intelligence or education, but a lack of determination and courage to think without the direction of another. ''[[wikt:Sapere aude|Sapere aude]]! Dare to know!'' is therefore the slogan of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].}}

In a paradoxical way, Kant supported in the same time [[enlightened despotism]] as a way of leading humanity towards its [[autonomy]]. He had conceived the process of history in his short treaty ''[[Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose]]'' (1784). On one hand, enlightened despotism was to lead nations toward their liberation, and progress was thus inscribed in the scheme of history; on the other hand, liberation could only be acquired by a singular gesture, ''Sapere Aude''! Thus, autonomy ultimately relied on the individual's "determination and courage to think without the direction of another."

After Kant, [[G. W. F. Hegel]] developed a complex theodicy in the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807), which based its conception of history on [[dialectics]]: the negative (wars, etc.) was conceived by Hegel as the motor of history. Hegel argued that history is a constant process of dialectic clash, with each [[thesis]] encountering an opposing idea or event [[antithesis]]. The clash of both was "superated" in the [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]], a conjunction that conserved the contradiction between thesis and its antithesis while [[Aufheben|sublating]] it. As [[Marx]] famously explained afterwards, concretely that meant that if [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]'s monarchic rule in France was seen as the thesis, the [[French Revolution]] could be seen as its antithesis. However, both were sublated in [[Napoleon]], who reconciled the revolution with the ''[[Ancien R√©gime]]''; he conserved the change. Hegel thought that [[reason]] accomplished itself, through this dialectical scheme, in History. Through [[Manual labour|labour]], man transformed nature so he could recognize himself in it; he made it his "home." Thus, reason spiritualized nature. Roads, fields, fences, and all the modern infrastructure in which we live is the result of this spiritualization of nature. Hegel thus explained social progress as the result of the labour of reason in history. However, this dialectical reading of history involved, of course, contradiction, so history was also conceived of as constantly conflicting: Hegel theorized this in his famous [[Slave-master dialectic|dialectic of the lord and the bondsman]].

According to Hegel,
{{quotation|One more word about giving instruction as to what the world ought to be. Philosophy in any case always comes on the scene too late to give it... When philosophy paints its gray in gray, then has a shape of life grown old. By philosophy's gray in gray it cannot be rejuvenated but only understood. The [[owl of Minerva]] spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk.|&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, [[Philosophy of Right]] (1820), "Preface"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, philosophy was to explain ''Geschichte'' (history) afterward. Philosophy is always late, it is only an interpretation of what is rational in the real‚Äîand, according to Hegel, only what is recognized as rational is real. This idealist understanding of philosophy as interpretation was famously challenged by [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Theses on Feuerbach|11th thesis on Feuerbach]]'' (1845): "''Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.''"

===Social evolutionism===
{{further information|Sociocultural evolution}} &lt;!-- the time sphere --&gt;
Inspired by the Enlightenment's ideal of progress, social evolutionism became a popular conception in the nineteenth century. [[Auguste Comte]]'s (1798‚Äì1857) [[positivism|positivist]] conception of history, which he divided into the theological stage, the metaphysical stage and the positivist stage, brought upon by modern science, was one of the most influential doctrines of progress. The [[Whig interpretation of history]], as it was later called, associated with scholars of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] eras in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], such as [[Henry Maine]] or [[Thomas Macaulay]], gives an example of such influence, by looking at human history as progress from savagery and ignorance toward peace, prosperity, and science. Maine described the direction of progress as "from status to contract," from a world in which a child's whole life is pre-determined by the circumstances of his birth, toward one of mobility and choice.

The publication of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 introduced [[human evolution]]. However, it was quickly transposed from its original biological field to the social field, in "[[social Darwinism]]" theories. [[Herbert Spencer]], who coined the term "[[survival of the fittest]]", or [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] in ''[[Ancient Society]]'' (1877) developed evolutionist theories independent from Darwin's works, which would be later interpreted as social Darwinism. These nineteenth-century [[unilineal evolution]] theories claimed that societies start out in a ''primitive'' state and gradually become more [[civilisation|civilised]] over time, and equated the culture and technology of Western civilisation with progress.

[[Ernst Haeckel]] formulated his [[recapitulation theory]] in 1867, which stated that "[[ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]]": the evolution of each individual reproduces the species' evolution, such as in the development of [[embryos]]. Hence, a child goes through all the steps from primitive society to modern society. This was later discredited.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Haeckel did not support Darwin's theory of [[natural selection]] introduced in ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' (1859), rather believing in a [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarckian]] [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]].

Progress was not necessarily, however, positive. [[Arthur Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853‚Äì55) was a [[decadence|decadent]] description of the evolution of the "[[Aryan race]]" which was disappearing through [[miscegenation]]. Gobineau's works had a large popularity in the so-called [[scientific racism]] theories that developed during the [[New Imperialism]] period.

After the [[World War I|first world war]], and even before [[Herbert Butterfield]] (1900‚Äì1979) harshly criticized it, the Whig interpretation had gone out of style. The bloodletting of that conflict had indicted the whole notion of linear progress. [[Paul Val√©ry]] famously said: "We civilizations now know ourselves mortal."

However, the notion itself didn't completely disappear. ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (1992) by [[Francis Fukuyama]] proposed a similar notion of progress, positing that the worldwide adoption of [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] as the single accredited political system and even modality of human consciousness would represent the "[[End of History]]". Fukuyama's work stems from an [[Alexandre Koj√®ve|Kojevian]] reading of Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807).

Unlike [[Maurice Godelier]] who interprets history as a process of transformation, [[Tim Ingold]] suggests that history is a movement of [[autopoiesis]]&lt;ref&gt;Ingold, T. On the Distinction between Evolution and History. Social Evolution &amp; History,. Vol. 1, num. 1. 2002. Pp. 5-24. P. 9, [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/130380/ socionauki.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;

A key component to making sense of all of this is to simply recognize that all these issues in social evolution merely serve to support the suggestion that how one considers the nature of history will impact the interpretation and conclusions drawn about history. The critical under-explored question is less about history as content and more about history as process.

In 2011 [[Steven Pinker]] wrote a history of violence and humanity from an evolutionary perspective in which he shows that violence has declined statistically over time.&lt;ref&gt;" The better angels of our nature, a history of violence and humanity ", by [[Steven Pinker]], published 2012 by Penguin books {{ISBN|978-0-141-03464-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The validity of the "great man theory" in historical studies===
{{further|Hero#The hero in historical studies|Great man theory}}

After Hegel, who insisted on the role of "[[Great man theory|great men]]" in history, with his famous statement about [[Napoleon]], "I saw the Spirit on his horse", [[Thomas Carlyle]] argued that history was the biography of a few central individuals, ''[[hero]]es'', such as [[Oliver Cromwell]] or [[Frederick the Great]], writing that "The history of the world is but the biography of great men." His heroes were political and military figures, the founders or topplers of states. His history of great men, of geniuses good and evil, sought to organize change in the advent of greatness. Explicit defenses of Carlyle's position have been rare in the late twentieth century. Most philosophers of history contend that the motive forces in history can best be described only with a wider lens than the one he used for his portraits. A.C. Danto, for example, wrote of the importance of the individual in history, but extended his definition to include ''social individuals,'' defined as "individuals we may provisionally characterize as containing individual human beings amongst their parts. Examples of social individuals might be social classes [...], national groups [...], religious organizations [...], large-scale events [...], large-scale social movements [...], etc." (Danto, "The Historical Individual", 266, in ''Philosophical Analysis and History,'' edited by Williman H. Dray, Rainbow-Bridge Book Co., 1966). The Great Man approach to history was most popular with professional historians in the nineteenth century; a popular work of this school is the ''[[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'' (1911), which contains lengthy and detailed biographies about the great men of history. For example, to read about (what is known today as) the "[[Migrations Period]]," consult the biography of [[Attila the Hun]].

After [[Marx]]'s [[historical materialism|conception of a materialist history]] based on the [[class struggle]], which raised attention for the first time to the importance of social factors such as economics in the unfolding of history, [[Herbert Spencer]] wrote "You must admit that the genesis of the great man depends on the long series of complex influences which has produced the race in which he appears, and the social state into which that race has slowly grown....Before he can remake his society, his society must make him."

The [[Annales School]], founded by [[Lucien Febvre]] and [[Marc Bloch]], were a major landmark on the shift from a history centered on [[subject (philosophy)|individual subjects]] to studies concentrating in [[geography]], economics, [[demography]], and other social forces. [[Fernand Braudel]]'s studies on the [[Mediterranean Sea]] as "hero" of history, [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]]'s history of [[climate]], etc., were inspired by this School.

==Is history predetermined?==
There is disagreement about the extent to which history is ultimately deterministic (see [[historical determinism]]). Some argue that geography (see [[geographic determinism]]), economic systems (see [[economic determinism]]), or culture (see [[cultural determinism]]) prescribe "the iron laws of history" that decide what is to happen. Others see history as a long line of acts and accidents, big and small, each playing out its consequences until that process gets interrupted by the next.

It should be noted that even determinists do not rule that, from time to time, certain cataclysmic events occur to change course of history. Their main point is, however, that such events are rare and that even apparently large shocks like wars and revolutions often have no more than temporary effects on the evolution of the society.

[[Karl Marx]] is, perhaps, the most famous of the exponents of economic determinism. For him social institutions like political system, religion and culture were merely by-products of the basic economic system (see [[Base and superstructure]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://economics.mit.edu/files/9658 Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo. Under the Thumb of History? Political institutions and the Scope for Action]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even he did not see history as completely deterministic. His essay ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'' contains the most famous formulation of Marx's view of the role of the individual in history: ''Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under given circumstances directly encountered and inherited from the past.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marx2mao.com/M&amp;E/EBLB52.html|title=The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte|work=marx2mao.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Does history have a teleological sense?==
{{further|Social progress|Progress (history)}}

[[Theodicy]] claimed that history had a progressive direction leading to an [[eschatological]] end, given by a superior power. However, this transcendent teleological sense can be thought as [[Immanence|immanent]] to human history itself. Hegel probably represents the epitome of teleological philosophy of history. Hegel's teleology was taken up by [[Francis Fukuyama]] in his ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (see ''Social evolutionism'' above). Thinkers such as [[Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Louis Althusser|Althusser]], or [[Deleuze]] deny any teleological sense to history, claiming that it is best characterized by discontinuities, ruptures, and various time-scales, which the [[Annales School]] had demonstrated.

Schools of thought influenced by Hegel also see history as progressive, but they saw, and see, progress as the outcome of a [[dialectic]] in which factors working in opposite directions are over time reconciled (see above). History was best seen as directed by a ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', and traces of the Zeitgeist could be seen by looking backward. Hegel believed that history was moving man toward "[[civilization]]", and some also claim he thought that the [[Prussia]]n state incarnated the "[[End of History]]". In his ''Lessons on the History of Philosophy'', he explains that each epochal philosophy is in a way the whole of philosophy; it is not a subdivision of the Whole but this Whole itself apprehended in a specific modality.

===Historical accounts of writing history===
{{further information|Historiography}}
A classic example of history being written by the victors‚Äîor more precisely, by the survivors&lt;ref name="wah"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Writing African History|author=Philips, John Edward|publisher=University Rochester Press|year=2006|pages=26‚Äì27}}&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äîwould be the scarcity of unbiased information that has survived to the present about the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]]. Roman historians left tales of cruelty and [[human sacrifice]] practiced by their longtime enemies; however no Carthaginian was left alive to give their side of the story.

Similarly, we only have the [[History of Christianity|Christian]] side of how Christianity came to be the dominant religion of Europe. However, we know very little about other European religions, such as [[Paganism]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} We have the European version of the [[European colonisation of the Americas|conquest of the Americas]], with an interpretation of the native version of events only emerging to popular consciousness since the early 1980s. We have [[Herodotus]]'s Greek history of the [[Persian Wars]], but the Persian recall of the events is little known in Western Culture.

In many respects, the head of state may be guilty of cruelties or even simply a different way of doing things. In some societies, however, to speak of or write critically of rulers can amount to conviction of treason and death. As such, in many ways, what is left as the "official record" of events is oft influenced by one's desire to avoid exile or execution.

However, "losers" in certain time periods often have more of an impetus than the "winners" to write histories that comfort themselves and [[self-justification|justify]] their own behavior.&lt;ref name="wah"/&gt; Examples include the historiography of the [[American Civil War]], where it can be argued that the losers (Southerners) have written more history books on the subject than the winners and, until recently, dominated the national perception of history. Confederate generals such as [[Robert E. Lee|Lee]] and [[Thomas J. Jackson|Jackson]] are generally held in higher esteem than their Union counterparts. Popular films such as ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'', ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', and ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' have told the story from the Southern viewpoint. Also, despite "losing" the [[Vietnam War]], the United States produces more scholarship on the war than any other country, including Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Triumph Revisited: Historians Battle for the Vietnam War|author=Wiest, Andrew A.|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2010|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular history abounds with condemnations of the cruelty of [[African slave trade]]rs and [[Colonization of Africa|colonists]], despite the "winning" status of those people in their heyday.&lt;ref name="wah"/&gt;

As is true of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|pre-Columbian populations of America]], the historical record of America being [[European colonization of the Americas|"discovered" by Europeans]] is now sometimes presented as a history of invasion, exploitation and dominance of a people who had been there before the Europeans. This reinterpretation of the historical record is called [[historical revisionism]], which can take the form of [[historical revisionism (negationism)|negationism]], which is the denial of [[genocide]]s and [[crimes against humanity]]. The revision of previously accepted historical accounts is a constant process in which "today's winners are tomorrow's losers", and the rise and fall of present institutions and movements influence the way historians see the past.&lt;ref name="wah"/&gt; In the same sense, the teaching, in [[Education in France|French secondary schools]], of the [[Algerian War of Independence#Historiography of the war and of colonialism|Algerian War of Independence and of colonialism]], has been criticized by several historians, and is the subject of frequent debates. Thus, in contradiction with the February 23, 2005 [[French law on colonialism|law on colonialism]], voted by the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] conservative party, historian Benjamin Stora notes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As Algerians do not appear in their "indigenous" conditions and their sub-citizens status, as the [[Nationalism and resistance in Algeria|history of nationalist movement]] is never evoqued, as none of the great figures of the resistance ‚Äî [[Messali Hadj]], [[Ferhat Abbas]] ‚Äî emerge nor retain attention, in one word, as no one explains to students what has been colonisation, we make them unable to understand why the decolonisation took place.&lt;ref name="DiploApril"&gt;[http://mondediplo.com/2001/04/04algeriatorture Colonialism through the school books - The hidden history of the Algerian war], ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', April 2001 {{en icon}}/{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Michel Foucault's analysis of historical and political discourse===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Hero]] --&gt;

The historico-political [[discourse]] analyzed by [[Michel Foucault]] in ''Society Must Be Defended'' (1975‚Äì76) considered [[truth]] as the fragile product of a historical struggle, first conceptualized under the name of "[[race struggle]]"‚Äîhowever, the meaning of "race" was different from today's biological notion, being closer to the sense of "nation" (distinct from [[nation-states]]; its signification is here closer to "people"). [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]], for example, was an exponent of nobility rights. He claimed that the French nobility were the racial descendants of the Franks who invaded France (while the Third Estate was descended from the conquered Gauls), and had right to power by virtue of right of conquest. He used this approach to formulate a historical thesis of the course of French political history‚Äîa critique of both the monarchy and the Third Estate. Foucault regarded him as the founder of the historico-political discourse as political weapon.

In Great Britain, this historico-political discourse was used by the bourgeoisie, the people and the aristocracy as a means of struggle against the monarchy‚Äîcf. [[Edward Coke]] or [[John Lilburne]]. In France, [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]], [[Nicolas Fr√©ret]], and then [[Siey√®s]], [[Augustin Thierry]], and [[Antoine Augustin Cournot|Cournot]] reappropriated this form of discourse. Finally, at the end of the nineteenth century, this discourse was incorporated by racialist biologists and [[eugenicists]], who gave it the modern sense of "race" and, even more, transformed this popular discourse into a "[[state racism]]" (Nazism). According to Foucault, [[Marxist]]s also seized this discourse and took it in a different direction, transforming the [[essentialist]] notion of "race" into the historical notion of "[[class struggle]]", defined by socially structured position: capitalist or proletarian. This displacement of discourse constitutes one of the bases of Foucault's thought: discourse is not tied to the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], rather the "subject" is a construction of discourse. Moreover, discourse is not the simple [[ideological]] and mirror reflexion of an economical [[infrastructure]], but is a product and the battlefield of multiples forces‚Äîwhich may not be reduced to the simple dualist [[contradiction]] of two energies.

Foucault shows that what specifies this discourse from the juridical and philosophical discourse is its conception of truth: truth is no longer absolute, it is the product of "race struggle". History itself, which was traditionally the sovereign's science, the [[legend]] of his glorious feats and monument building,he(the sovereign) built monuments,fought in wars and claims victory on behalf of himself which ultimately became the discourse of the people (modern population), a political stake. The subject is not any more a neutral [[arbitrator]], judge, or [[legislator]], as in [[Solon]]'s or Kant's conceptions. Therefore, what became the "[[historical subject]]" must search in history's furor, under the "juridical code's dried blood", the multiple [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingencies]] from which a fragile [[rationality]] temporarily finally emerged. This may be, perhaps, compared to the [[sophist]] discourse in Ancient Greece. Foucault warns that it has nothing to do with [[Machiavelli]]'s or [[Hobbes]]'s discourse on war, for to this popular discourse, the [[sovereignty|Sovereign]] is nothing more than "an illusion, an instrument, or, at the best, an enemy. It is {the historico-political discourse} a discourse that beheads the king, anyway that dispenses itself from the sovereign and that denounces it".

===History and education===

{{Further information|Education|Pedagogy|Philosophy of education}}
Since [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', civic education and instruction has had a central role in politics and the constitution of a common identity. History has thus sometimes become the target of [[propaganda]], for example in [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionist]] attempts. Plato's insistence on the importance of education was relayed by Rousseau's ''[[Emile: Or, On Education]]'' (1762), a necessary counterpart of ''The [[Social Contract]]'' (also 1762). [[Public education]] has been seen by republican regimes and the Enlightenment as a prerequisite of the masses' progressive emancipation, as conceived by Kant in ''[[What is Enlightenment?|Was Ist Aufkl√§rung?]]'' (What Is Enlightenment?, 1784).

The creation of modern education systems, instrumental in the construction of [[nation-states]], also passed by the elaboration of a common, national history. [[History textbooks]] are one of the many ways through which this common history was transmitted. ''[[Le Tour de France par deux enfants]]'', for example, was the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]'s classic textbook for elementary school: it described the story of two French children who, following the German annexation of the [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region in 1870, go on a ''tour de France'' during which they become aware of France's diversity and the existence of the various ''[[patois]]''.

In most societies, schools and curricula are controlled by governments. As such, there is always an opportunity for governments to impose. Granted, often governments in free societies serve to protect freedoms, check [[hate speech]], and breaches of constitutional rights; but the power itself to impose is available to use the education system to influence thought of malleable minds, positively or negatively, towards truth or towards a version of truth. A recent example of the fragility of government involvement with history textbooks was the [[Japanese history textbook controversies]].

===Narrative and history===
A current popular conception considers the value of narrative in the writing and experience of history. Important thinkers in this area include [[Paul Ric≈ìur]], [[Louis Mink]], [[W.B. Gallie]], and [[Hayden White]]. Some have doubted this approach because it draws fictional and historical narrative closer together, and there remains a perceived "fundamental bifurcation between historical and fictional narrative" (Ric≈ìur, vol. 1, 52). In spite of this, most modern historians, such as [[Barbara Tuchman]] or [[David McCullough]], consider narrative writing important to their approaches. The theory of narrated history (or historicized narrative) holds that the structure of lived experience, and such experience narrated in both fictional and non-fictional works (literature and historiography) have in common the figuration of "temporal experience." In this way, narrative has a generously encompassing ability to "'grasp together' and integrate ... into one whole and complete story" the "composite representations" of historical experience (Ric≈ìur x, 173). Louis Mink writes that, "the significance of past occurrences is understandable only as they are locatable in the ensemble of interrelationships that can be grasped only in the construction of narrative form" (148). Marxist theorist [[Fredric Jameson]] also analyzes historical understanding this way, and writes that "history is inaccessible to us except in textual form ... it can be approached only by way of prior (re)textualization" (82).

===History and causality===

{{see also|Causality}}

Narrative and causal approaches to history have often been contrasted or, even, opposed to one another, yet they can also be viewed as complementary.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitson, M. (2014) ''History and Causality'', 127-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers of history such as Arthur Danto have claimed that "explanations in history and elsewhere" describe "not simply an event‚Äîsomething that happens‚Äîbut a change".&lt;ref&gt;Danto, A. (1968) ''Analytical Philosophy of History'', 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many practicing historians, they treat causes as intersecting actions and sets of actions which bring about "larger changes", in Danto's words: to decide "what are the elements which persist through a change" is "rather simple" when treating an individual's "shift in attitude", but "it is considerably more complex and metaphysically challenging when we are interested in such a change as, say, the break-up of feudalism or the emergence of nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;Danto, A. (1968) ''Analytical Philosophy of History'', 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the historical debate about causes has focused on the relationship between communicative and other actions, between singular and repeated ones, and between actions, structures of action or group and institutional contexts and wider sets of conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitson, M. (2014) ''History and Causality'', 86-116.&lt;/ref&gt; John Gaddis has distinguished between exceptional and general causes (following Marc Bloch) and between "routine" and "distinctive links" in causal relationships: "in accounting for what happened at Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, we attach greater importance to the fact that President Truman ordered the dropping of an atomic bomb than to the decision of the Army Air Force to carry out his orders."&lt;ref&gt;Gaddis, J. L. (2002) ''The Landscape of History: How Historians Map the Past'', 64.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also pointed to the difference between immediate, intermediate and distant causes. For his part, Christopher Lloyd puts forward four "general concepts of causation" used in history: the "metaphysical idealist concept, which asserts that the phenomena of the universe are products of or emanations from an omnipotent being or such final cause"; "the empiricist (or Humean) regularity concept, which is based on the idea of causation being a matter of constant conjunctions of events"; "the functional/teleological/consequential concept", which is "goal-directed, so that goals are causes"; and the "realist, structurist and dispositional approach, which sees relational structures and internal dispositions as the causes of phenomena".&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, C. (1993) ''Structures of History'', 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History as propaganda: Is history always written by the victors?===
In his "Society must be Defended", [[Michel Foucault]] posited that the victors of a social struggle use their political dominance to suppress a defeated adversary's version of historical events in favor of their own [[propaganda]], which may go so far as [[historical revisionism (political)|historical revisionism]]. (See ''Michel Foucault's analysis of historical and political discourse'' above.) Nations adopting such an approach would likely fashion a "universal" theory of history, a [[manifest destiny]] in the US, to support their aims, with a teleological and deterministic philosophy of history used to justify the inevitableness and rightness of their victories.

[[Wolfgang Schivelbusch]]'s ''Culture of Defeat'' took a completely different view‚Äîaccording to him, defeat is a major driver for the defeated to reinvent himself, while the victor‚Äîconfirmed in his attitudes and methods, dissatisfied by the high losses and paltry gains made, may be less creative and fall back. The concept evokes Hegel's [[Master‚Äìslave dialectic]]s‚Äîthe master is dependent of the work of the slave, the slave has to take his master's and his own interests into account, gets more knowledge and more insight as the master; and in realising that the world around him was created by his own hands he may gain self-consciousness and emancipation. Schivelbusch worked on three basic examples, the South and its [[Lost cause]] after the Civil War, France after the Franco-Prussian War 1870/71, and Germany following World War I. Wolfgang Schivelbusch view includes complex psychological and cultural responses of vanquished nations, from every level of society and sees a need and rise of creativity and various narratives for the defeated.&lt;ref&gt;The Culture of Defeat by Wolfgang Schivelbusch, trans Jefferson Chase Granta, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/29/history.highereducation1 Guardian review 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a society [[Walter Benjamin]] believed that Marxist historians must take a radically different view point from the [[bourgeois]] and [[idealist]] points of view, in an attempt to create a sort of [[People's history|history from below]], which would be able to conceive an alternative conception of history, not based, as in classical historical studies, on the philosophical and juridical discourse of [[sovereignty]]‚Äîan approach that would invariably adhere to major states (the victors') points of view.  Philosopher Paul Ricoeur asked instead for a plurality in history writing. "We carry on several histories simultaneously, in times whose periods, crises, and pauses do not coincide. We enchain, abandon, and resume several histories, much as a chess player who plays several games at once, renewing now this one, now the another" (''History and Truth'' 186). [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' is a fictional account of the manipulation of the historical record for nationalist aims and manipulation of power.

To some degree, all nations are active in the promotion of such "national stories", with ethnicity, nationalism, gender, power, heroic figures, class considerations and important national events and trends all clashing and competing within the narrative.

With regard to the [[history of science]], the introduction of new paradigms is depicted by [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''.&lt;ref name=kuhnw&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; Innovation in science or technology is not based on single experiments or ideas per se, but needs a supportive environment and technical achievements to allow for a change of perspective. In all sorts of science (for e.g. mathematics see Bair et al. 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The process may lead to [[format war]]s, which leaves losers and winners behind.

The [[Semmelweis reflex]] is a metaphor for the reflex-like tendency to reject new evidence or new knowledge because it contradicts established norms, beliefs or paradigms, Semmelweis himself being driven into insanity, but his concept prevailing after his death grew in a strong [[narrative]] of the [[history of medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;Carter, K.

==Judgement of history&lt;!--'Judgement of history' redirects here--&gt;==
For Hegel, the history of the world is also the Last Judgement. Hegel adopted the expression "[[:de:Die Weltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht|Die Weltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht]]" ("[[world history]] is a tribunal that judges the world"; a quote from [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s poem "Resignation" (published in 1786) and used to assert the view that History is what judges men, their actions and their opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Janez Juhant, Bojan ≈Ωalec (eds.), ''Reconciliation: The Way of Healing and Growth'', LIT Verlag M√ºnster, 2012, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Louvre Grab.JPG|thumb|Life sized pleurants from the [[tomb of Philippe Pot]]]]
[[File:Tien pleurants.jpg|thumb|Pleurants of Isabella of Bourbon]]
'''Pleurants''' or '''weepers''' (the English meaning of ''pleurants'') are anonymous sculpted figures representing [[mourner|mourners]], used to decorate elaborate [[tomb monument]]s, mostly in the late Middle Ages in Western Europe.  Typically they are relatively small, and a group were placed around the sides of a raised tomb monument, perhaps interspersed with armorial decoration, or carrying shields with this.  They may be in [[relief]] or free-standing.  In English usage the term "weepers" is sometimes extended to cover the small figures of the deceased's children often seen kneeling underneath the [[tomb effigy]] in Tudor tomb monuments. 

These figures represent the mourners, who pray for the deceased standing during the funeral procession.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 146&lt;/ref&gt;  Because many of the original tombs have been vandalised or destroyed, relatively few examples remain to be studied. Many figures have been detached from their original context, which is not always known.

In the 16th and 17th century the practice of placing anonymous pleurant figures disappeared, although the group at Brou for [[Margaret of Bourbon (1438‚Äì1483)|Margaret of Bourbon]] were not begun until 1526 at the earliest.  But these were commissioned over 40 years after her death by her daughter, along with tombs for herself and her husband, and reflected the taste of Margaret's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Burk, Jens Ludwig, "Conrat Meit, Margaret of Austria's Court Sculptor in Malines and Brou", Centre des monuments nationaux (France) &lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain==
The type began in England in the 13th century, inspired by French examples. The first examples had relief figures set within quatrefoil frames, as in the tomb now used for [[Henry Marshal (bishop of Exeter)|Henry Marshal, Bishop of Exeter]] (d. 1206) in [[Exeter Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 146. The tomb now carries his effigy, but dates to the second half of the century&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded use of the English word is in a contract relating to the construction of the very grand tomb of [[Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick]], who died in 1437 in France, though the contract is some time later, and the weepers were made in 1452‚Äì53. This has the effigy and weepers in [[gilt-bronze]], and still stands in the [[Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick]], with the "xiv images embossed of lords and ladyes in divers verstures, called weepers", standing in niches around the sides, that were specified.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 207‚Äì209; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aKJbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10 the contract]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Franco-Burgundian examples ==
On the Continent they are especially a feature of the tombs of Franco-Burgundian royalty, imitated by some grand nobles.  The tomb at [[Royaumont Abbey]] of [[Louis of France (1244‚Äì1260)]], son of [[Louis IX of France]], appears to have popularized the type.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 146&lt;/ref&gt;  Here a side of the chest below the effigy shows eight walking figures in relief in an arcade, led by two mitred clerics.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Louiss1260.jpg|image]]&lt;/ref&gt; One end of the chest had a relief of the dead prince, covered by a cloth that leaves his face exposed being carried by four bearers.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Cort√®ge des fun√©railles de Louis de France (1260).jpg|Image, now mus√©e Carnavalet]]. Rather bizarrely, after the Revolution this panel was re-used for the "grave" of [[Peter Abelard|Abelard]] and [[H√©lo√Øse]] at [[P√®re Lachaise]] cemetery.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10813">{{Environmental law}}
In [[environmental law]], the '''polluter pays principle''' is enacted to make the [[Party (law)|party]] responsible for producing [[pollution]] responsible for paying for the damage done to the [[natural environment]]. It is regarded as a regional custom because of the strong support it has received in most [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and [[European Union]] countries. It is a fundamental principle in US environmental law.

== History ==
According to the French [[historian of the environment]] Jean-Baptiste Fressoz, [[financial compensation]] (not named "polluter pays principle" at that time) is already the regulation principle of [[Industrial pollution|pollution]] favoured by industrials in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=Ulmi&gt;{{fr}} Nic Ulmi, [https://www.letemps.ch/sciences/2016/10/18/aux-origines-crise-ecologique "Aux origines de la crise √©cologique"] [The origins of the ecological crisis], ''[[Le temps]]'', 18 October 2016 (page visited on 22 October 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that: "This principle, which is now offered as a new solution, actually accompanied the process of industrialisation, and was intended by the manufacturers themselves."&lt;ref name=Ulmi/&gt;

== Applications in environmental law==
The polluter pays principle underpins environmental policy such as an [[ecotax]], which, if enacted by government, deters and essentially reduces [[greenhouse gas emissions]]. This principle is based on the fact that as much as pollution is unavoidable, the person or industry that is responsible for the pollution must pay some money for the rehabilitation of the polluted environment.

===Australia===
The state of [[New South Wales]] in [[Australia]] has included the polluter pay principle with the other principles of [[ecologically sustainable development]] in the objectives of the Environment Protection Authority.&lt;ref&gt;Protection of the Environment Administration Act 1991, section 6(2)(d)(i)[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/poteaa1991485/s6.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
The polluter pays principle is set out in the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] &lt;ref&gt;Article 191(2) TFEU&lt;/ref&gt; and Directive 2004/35/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council|Council]] of 21 April 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage is based on this principle. The directive entered into force on 30 April 2004; member states were allowed three years to transpose the [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] into their domestic law and by July 2010 all member states had completed this.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/legal/liability/ Environmental Liability], accessed 29 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== France ===
In France, the Charter for the Environment contains a formulation of the polluter pays principle (article 4):
{{Block quote|Everyone shall be required, in the conditions provided for by law, to contribute to the making good of any damage he or she may have caused to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/anglais/charter_environnement.pdf ''Charter for the Environment''], [[Constitutional Council (France)|Constitutional Council]] (page visited on 28 August 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ghana===
In [[Ghana]], the polluter pays principle was adopted in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Ghana Business News, [https://www.ghanabusinessnews.com/2011/12/08/cabinet-approves-polluter-pays-principle/ Cabinet approves Polluter Pays Principle], 8 December 2011, accessed 29 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
The polluter pays principle is also known as '''extended producer responsibility''' (EPR). This is a concept that was probably first described by Thomas Lindhqvist for the [[Swedish government]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;The International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics at Lund University, Sweden (2000).[http://www.lub.lu.se/luft/diss/tec355.pdf "Extended Producer Responsibility in Cleaner Production"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513010736/http://www.lub.lu.se/luft/diss/tec355.pdf |date=2014-05-13 }} Doctoral Dissertation (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; EPR seeks to shift the responsibility of dealing with waste from [[government]]s (and thus, [[taxpayer]]s and society at large) to the entities producing it. In effect, it internalised the cost of waste disposal into the cost of the product, theoretically meaning that the producers will improve the waste profile of their products, thus decreasing waste and increasing possibilities for reuse and recycling.

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] defines extended producer responsibility as: &lt;blockquote&gt;
a concept where manufacturers and importers of products should bear a significant degree of responsibility for the environmental impacts of their products throughout the product life-cycle, including upstream impacts inherent in the selection of materials for the products, impacts from manufacturers‚Äô production process itself, and downstream impacts from the use and disposal of the products. Producers accept their responsibility when designing their products to minimise life-cycle environmental impacts, and when accepting legal, physical or socio-economic responsibility for environmental impacts that cannot be eliminated by design.&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Environment Directorate, Paris, France (2006).[http://www.oecd.org/document/53/0,3343,en_2649_34395_37284725_1_1_1_1,00.html "Extended Producer Responsibility."] Project Fact Sheet.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
The [[waste management in Switzerland]] is based on the polluter pays principle.&lt;ref name=Skjellaug/&gt; [[Bin bag]]s (for [[municipal solid waste]]) are taxed with [[Pay as you throw|pay-per-bag fees]] in three quarters of the [[Municipalities of Switzerland|communes]] (and the recycling rate doubled in twenty years).&lt;ref name=Skjellaug&gt;{{fr}} A√Øna Skjellaug, [https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/2016/09/06/lautre-or-suisse-dechets "L‚Äôautre or de la Suisse, ses d√©chets"], ''[[Le temps]]'', Tuesday 6 September 2016 (page visited on 6 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) Regulations 2009 (for England) and the Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) (Wales) Regulations 2009 (for Wales) established the operation of the polluter pays principle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130402182915/http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/policy/liability/pdf/quick-guide-regs09.pdf The Environmental Damage Regulations: Preventing and Remedying Environmental Damage], accessed 29 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The principle is employed in all of the major US pollution control laws: [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/air-enforcement |title=Air Enforcement |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-12-01 |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clean Water Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/water-enforcement |title=Water Enforcement |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-12-14 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (solid waste and hazardous waste management),&lt;ref name="EPA-waste"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/waste-chemical-and-cleanup-enforcement |title=Waste, Chemical, and Cleanup Enforcement |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-01-07 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Superfund]] (cleanup of abandoned waste sites).&lt;ref name="EPA-waste"/&gt;

Some eco-taxes underpinned by the polluter pays principle include:
* the [[Gas Guzzler Tax]] for motor vehicles
* [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE), a "polluter pays" [[Fine (penalty)|fine]].
* the Superfund law requires polluters to pay for cleanup of hazardous waste sites, when the polluters can be identified.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite report |date=June 1996 |title=The Buck Stops Here: Polluters are Paying for Most Hazardous Waste Cleanups |periodical=Superfund Today (newsletter) |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=10001XKT.txt |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-540-K-96/004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, an [[Polluter pays amendment|amendment]] was passed negating the "polluter pays" provision of the [[Constitution of Florida|Florida Constitution]].

====Limitations of polluter pays principle====
The US [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has observed that the polluter pays principle has typically not been fully implemented in [[United States environmental law|US laws]] and programs. For example, [[water purification|drinking water]] and [[sewage treatment]] services are [[subsidy|subsidized]] and there are limited mechanisms in place to fully assess polluters for treatment costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2003 |title=Water and Wastewater Pricing: An Informational Overview |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi/901U1200.PDF?Dockey=901U1200.PDF |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-832-F-03-027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zimbabwe===
The [[Zimbabwe]] Environmental Management Act of 2002 &lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.kubatana.net/docs/legisl/env_mgmt_act_060325.pdf Chapter 20:27]&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits the discharge of pollutants into the environment. In line with the "Polluter Pays" principle, the Act requires a polluter to meet the cost of decontaminating the polluted environment.&lt;ref&gt;The Herald (Harare), [http://www.herald.co.zw/polluter-pays-as-environmental-management-principle/ Polluter pays as environmental management principle], 18 May 2016, accessed 6 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==In international environmental law==
In [[international environmental law]] it is mentioned in the principle 16 of the [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]] of 1992.

'''Project Exploration''' is a not-for-profit educational program whose goal is to "change the face of science" by encouraging interest in science among students‚Äîespecially girls and minorities‚Äîwho traditionally have not found effective career routes into scientific disciplines. Its primary method is to create intensive collaborative relationships between students and working field researchers through structured programs involving the [[University of Chicago]] and other institutions. In January 2010, it received a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring.&lt;ref name="press1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-honor-teachers-and-mentors-announce-key-partnerships-educate-innova|title=President Obama to Honor Teachers and Mentors, Announce Key Partnerships in "Educate to Innovate" Campaign|date=January 4, 2010 |publisher=The White House, Office of the Press Secretary|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization, founded in 1999, is based in Chicago, Illinois, USA.

==Activities==
Project Exploration currently serves nearly 1,000 students.  It began as an after-school and summer program when Gabrielle Lyon, a teacher at Fiske Elementary School on the [[South Side of Chicago]], decided that students underrepresented in the sciences, primarily girls and minorities, should be given opportunities to collaborate with actual scientists and participate in real-life scientific research. Students design research projects and test them in the field, or work summers at museums demonstrating science to young children.&lt;ref name="Trib"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2009/jul/17/local/chi-president-award-sciencejul17|title=Chicago-based Project Exploration wins a presidential award for science education|last=Mitchum|first=Robert |date=July 17, 2009|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Sisters4Science
Sisters4Science is a year-round after-school and field program that combines science exploration with leadership development for approximately 100 minority middle school girls. Girls participate in hands-on science activities led by women scientists as well as participate in science-based field trips.&lt;ref name="s4s"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectexploration.org/s4s/|title=Sisters4Science|publisher=Project Exploration|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Girls Health and Science Day
Project Exploration organizes a one-day symposium with workshops on the topics of sexuality and tolerance, healthy relationships, self-worth, the female body, and self-defense for female students across Chicago in grades 7-10.&lt;ref name="ghsd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectexploration.org/ghsd|title=Girls Health and Science Day|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* All Girls Expedition
The All Girls Expedition is an intensive two-week classroom and field work experience for twenty girls .  It includes intensive classroom instruction in geology, biology, evaluation, and field skills followed by one week working in the field alongside scientists.&lt;ref name="age"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectexploration.org/age/ |title=All Girls Expedition  |publisher=Project Exploration|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent expedition was to [[Yellowstone National Park]] in Wyoming, to conduct fieldwork on the water chemistry of geysers, track [[coyotes]] and explore a cave with Project Exploration and Yellowstone researchers.&lt;ref name="UofChi1"/&gt;

* The Science Teacher Field Institute
The Science Teacher Field Institute is an annual three-week professional development program for Chicago Public School teachers  which includes both classroom and field experience with scientists in the disciplines of geology, paleontology, and [[astronomy]].  All costs are covered by private donations.&lt;ref name="stfi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectexploration.org/stfi/|title=The Science Teacher Field Institute |publisher=Project Exploration|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This program includes field work at eastern [[Montana]]'s Lost-in-Time Ranch under supervision of professional paleontologists from the University of Chicago and Project co-founder Gabrielle Lyon.&lt;ref name="UofChi1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.uchicago.edu/news.php?asset_id=1644|title=Project Exploration offers mammoth-scale summer learning experience|date=25 June 2009|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidential Award==
The Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring, awarded each year to individuals or organizations, recognizes the crucial role that mentoring plays in the academic and personal development of students studying science or engineering and who belong to minorities that are underrepresented in those fields. By offering their time, encouragement and expertise to these students, mentors help ensure that the next generation of scientists and engineers will better reflect the diversity of the United States.
Candidates for the Presidential Mentoring Award are nominated by colleagues, administrators, and students from their home institutions.  The mentoring can involve students at any grade level from elementary through graduate school. In addition to being honored at the [[White House]], recipients receive awards of $10,000 to advance their mentoring efforts. "There is no higher calling than furthering the educational advancement of our nation‚Äôs young people and encouraging and inspiring our next generation of leaders," [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] said. "These awards represent a heartfelt salute of appreciation to a remarkable group of individuals who have devoted their lives and careers to helping others and in doing so have helped us all."&lt;ref name="whitehouse2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Honors-Outstanding-Science-Math-Engineering-Teachers-And-Mentors/|title=President Honors Outstanding Science Math Engineering Teachers And Mentors/|date=9 July 2009|publisher=The White House, Office of the Press Secretary|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award to Project Exploration was announced in July 2009.&lt;ref name="Trib" /&gt; The award ceremony took place in January 2010 at the White House.

'''Radiation pressure''' is the [[pressure]] exerted upon any surface due to the exchange of [[momentum]] between the object and the [[electromagnetic field]]. This includes the momentum of light or [[electromagnetic radiation]] of any [[wavelength]] which is [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]],  [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]], or otherwise emitted (e.g. [[black body radiation]]) by matter on any scale (from macroscopic objects to dust particles to gas molecules).&lt;ref&gt;Stellar Atmospheres, D. Mihalas (1978), Second edition, W H Freeman &amp; Co&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eddington, A. S., &amp; Eddington, A. S. (1988). The internal constitution of the stars. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, S. (2013). Radiative transfer. Courier Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The forces generated by radiation pressure are generally too small to be noticed under everyday circumstances; however, they are important in some physical processes. This particularly includes objects in [[outer space]] where it is usually the main force acting on objects besides gravity, and where the net effect of a tiny force may have a large cumulative effect over long periods of time. For example, had the effects of the sun's radiation pressure on the spacecraft of the [[Viking program]] been ignored, the spacecraft would have missed Mars orbit by about {{cvt|15000|km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Hecht, "Optics", 4th edition (p. 57)&lt;/ref&gt; Radiation pressure from starlight is crucial in a number of [[astrophysical]] processes as well. The significance of radiation pressure increases rapidly at extremely high temperatures, and can sometimes dwarf the usual [[Kinetic theory of gases|gas pressure]], for instance in [[Stellar structure|stellar interiors]] and [[thermonuclear weapons]].

Radiation pressure can equally well be accounted for by considering the momentum of a classical electromagnetic field or in terms of the momenta of [[photons]], particles of light. The interaction of electromagnetic waves or photons with matter may involve an exchange of [[momentum]]. Due to the law of [[conservation of momentum]], any change in the total momentum of the waves or photons must involve an equal and opposite change in the momentum of the matter it interacted with ([[Newton's third law of motion]]), as is illustrated in the accompanying figure for the case of light being perfectly reflected by a surface. This transfer of momentum is the general explanation for what we term radiation pressure.

== Discovery ==
[[Johannes Kepler]] put forward the concept of radiation pressure back in 1619 to explain the observation that a tail of a [[comet]] always points away from the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Kepler|author-link=Johannes Kepler|title=[[De Cometis Libelli Tres]]|date=1619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assertion that light, as [[electromagnetic radiation]], has the property of [[momentum]] and thus exerts a [[pressure]] upon any surface it is exposed to was published by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1862, and proven experimentally by Russian physicist [[Pyotr Nikolaevich Lebedev|Pyotr Lebedev]] in 1900&lt;ref&gt;P. Lebedev, 1901, "Untersuchungen √ºber die Druckkr√§fte des Lichtes", Annalen der Physik, 1901&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Ernest Fox Nichols]] and [[Gordon Ferrie Hull]] in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, E.F &amp; Hull, G.F. (1903) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8n8OAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA5-PA327&amp;dq=torsion+balance+radiation The Pressure due to Radiation], ''The Astrophysical Journal'',Vol.17 No.5, p.315-351&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure is very feeble, but can be detected by allowing the radiation to fall upon a delicately poised vane of reflective metal in a [[Nichols radiometer]] (this should not be confused with the [[Crookes radiometer]], whose characteristic motion is ''not'' caused by radiation pressure but by impacting gas molecules).

== Theory ==
{{See also|Electromagnetic radiation|Speed of light}}
Radiation pressure can be viewed as a consequence of the [[conservation of momentum]] given the momentum attributed to electromagnetic radiation. That momentum can be equally well calculated on the basis of electromagnetic theory or from the combined momenta of a stream of photons, giving identical results as is shown below.

=== Radiation pressure from momentum of an electromagnetic wave ===
{{Main|Poynting vector}}
According to Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism, an electromagnetic wave carries momentum, which will be transferred to an opaque surface it strikes.

The energy flux (irradiance) of a plane wave is calculated using the [[Poynting vector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt;, whose magnitude we denote by S. S divided by the [[speed of light]] is the density of the linear momentum per unit area (pressure) of the electromagnetic field. That pressure is experienced as radiation pressure on the surface:

:&lt;math&gt;    P_\text{incident}=\frac{\langle S\rangle}{c} = \frac{I_f}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is pressure (usually in [[Pascals]]), &lt;math&gt;I_f&lt;/math&gt; is the incident [[irradiance]] (usually in W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum.

If the surface is planar at an angle &amp;alpha; to the incident wave, the intensity across the surface will be geometrically reduced by the cosine of that angle and the component of the radiation force against the surface will also be reduced by the cosine of &amp;alpha;, resulting in a pressure:

:&lt;math&gt; P_\text{incident} = \frac{I_f}{c} \cos^2 \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

The momentum from the incident wave is in the same direction of that wave.  But only the component of that momentum normal to the surface contributes to the pressure on the surface, as given above.  The component of that force tangent to the surface is not called pressure.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;

=== Radiation pressure from reflection ===
The above treatment for an incident wave accounts for the radiation pressure experienced by a black (totally absorbing) body. If the wave is [[specularly reflected]], then the recoil due to the reflected wave will further contribute to the radiation pressure. In the case of a perfect reflector, this pressure will be identical to the pressure caused by the incident wave:

:&lt;math&gt;    P_\text{emitted}= \frac{I_f}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

thus ''doubling'' the net radiation pressure on the surface:

:&lt;math&gt;    P_\text{net}=   P_\text{incident} +  P_\text{emitted}= 2 \frac{I_f}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

For a partially reflective surface, the second term must be multiplied by the reflectivity (also known as reflection coefficient of intensity), so that the increase is less than double. For a [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely reflective]] surface, the details of the reflection and geometry must be taken into account, again resulting in an increased net radiation pressure of less than double.

===Radiation pressure by emission===
Just as a wave reflected from a body contributes to the net radiation pressure experienced, a body that emits radiation of its own (rather than reflected) obtains a radiation pressure again given by the irradiance of that emission ''in the direction normal to the surface'' ''I&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;    P_\text{emitted}= \frac{I_e}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

The emission can be from [[black body radiation]] or any other radiative mechanism. Since all materials emit black body radiation (unless they are totally reflective or at absolute zero), this source for radiation pressure is ubiquitous but usually very tiny. However, because black body radiation increases rapidly with temperature (according to the fourth power of temperature as given by the [[Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann law]]), radiation pressure due to the temperature of a very hot object (or due to incoming black body radiation from similarly hot surroundings) can become very significant. This becomes important in stellar interiors which are at millions of degrees.

=== Radiation pressure in terms of photons ===
{{See also|Photons|Momentum}}
Electromagnetic radiation can be [[wave‚Äìparticle duality|viewed]] in terms of particles rather than waves; these particles are known as [[photons]]. Photons do not have a rest-mass, however photons are never at rest (they move at the speed of light) and acquire a momentum nonetheless which is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
p = \dfrac{h}{\lambda} = \frac{E_p}{c},
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''p'' is momentum, ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]], &amp;lambda; is [[wavelength]], and ''c'' is speed of light in vacuum. And ''E&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the energy of a single photon given by: 
:&lt;math&gt;
E_p = h \nu =\frac{h c}{\lambda}
&lt;/math&gt;

The radiation pressure again can be seen as the transfer of each photon's momentum to the opaque surface, plus the momentum due to a (possible) recoil photon for a (partially) reflecting surface. Since an incident wave of irradiance ''I&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' over an area ''A'' has a power of  ''I&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;A'', this implies a flux of ''I&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;/E&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' photons per second per unit area striking the surface. Combining this with the above expression for the momentum of a single photon, results in the same relationships between irradiance and radiation pressure described above using classical electromagnetics. And again, reflected or otherwise emitted photons will contribute to the net radiation pressure identically.

===Compression in a uniform radiation field===

In general, the pressure of electromagnetic waves can be obtained from the [[Electromagnetic_stress‚Äìenergy_tensor#Algebraic_properties|vanishing of the trace of the electromagnetic stress tensor]]: Since this trace [[Stress‚Äìenergy_tensor#Stress‚Äìenergy_of_a_fluid_in_equilibrium|equals 3''P'' - ''u'']], we get
:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{u}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''u'' is the radiation density per unit volume. 

This can also be shown in the specific case of the pressure exerted on surfaces of a body in [[thermal equilibrium]] with its surroundings, at a temperature ''T'': The body will be surrounded by a uniform radiation field described by the [[Planck law|Planck black body radiation law]], and will experience a compressive pressure due to that impinging radiation, its reflection, and its own black body emission. From that it can be shown that the resulting pressure is equal to one third of the total radiant energy per unit volume in the surrounding space.&lt;ref&gt;Shankar R., ''Principles of Quantum Mechanics'', 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Bradley W.  &amp; Dale A. Ostlie, ''An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics'', 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, John David, (1999) ''Classical Electrodynamics''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kardar, Mehran. "Statistical Physics of Particles".&lt;/ref&gt;

By using [[Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann law]], this can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{compress} = \frac{u}{3} = \frac{4\sigma}{3c} T^4 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann constant]].

==Solar radiation pressure==

Solar radiation pressure is due to the sun's radiation at closer distances, thus especially within the [[solar system]].  While it acts on all objects, its net effect is generally greater on smaller bodies since they have a larger ratio of surface area to mass.  All spacecraft experience such a pressure except when they are behind the shadow of a larger [[Orbiting body | orbiting body]].

Solar radiation pressure on objects near the earth may be calculated using the sun's [[irradiance]] at 1&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]], known as the [[solar constant]] or ''G&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;'', whose value is set at '''1361&amp;nbsp;[[Watt|W]]/[[Metre|m]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''' as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|author=Kopp, G.

|publisher=Geophysical Research Letters 38
|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010GL045777/pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All stars have a [[spectral energy distribution]] that depends on their surface temperature.  The distribution is approximately that of [[black-body radiation]].  This distribution must be taken into account when calculating the radiation pressure or identifying reflector materials for optimizing a [[solar sail]] for instance.

===Pressures of absorption and reflection===

Solar radiation pressure at the earth's distance from the sun, may be calculated by dividing the [[solar constant]] ''G&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;'' (above) by the [[speed of light]] c.  For an absorbing sheet facing the sun, this is simply:&lt;ref name="RMG"&gt;Georgevic, R. M. (1973) "The Solar Radiation Pressure Forces and Torques Model", ''The Journal of the Astronautical Sciences'', Vol. 27, No. 1, Jan‚ÄìFeb. First known publication describing how solar radiation pressure creates forces and torques that affect spacecraft.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; P  = \frac{G_\text{SC}}{c}  \approx  4.5 \cdot 10^{-6}  \textsf{ Pa} = 4.5 \mu \textsf{Pa} &lt;/math&gt;

This result is in the [[S.I.]] unit [[Pascals]], equivalent to N/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Newtons]] per square meter). For a sheet at an angle Œ± to the sun, the effective area ''A'' of a sheet is reduced by a geometrical factor resulting in a force ''in the direction of the sunlight'' of:

:&lt;math&gt; F = \frac{G_\text{SC}}{c } (A \cos \alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

To find the component of this force normal to the surface, another cosine factor must be applied resulting in a pressure ''P'' on the surface of:

:&lt;math&gt; P  =  \frac{F}{A} = \frac{G_\text{SC}}{c} \cos^2 \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

Note, however, that in order to account for the net effect of solar radiation on a spacecraft for instance, one would need to consider the ''total'' force (in the direction away from the sun) given by the preceding equation, rather than just the component normal to the surface that we identify as "pressure".

The solar constant is defined for the sun's radiation at the distance to the earth, also known as one [[astronomical unit]] (AU). Consequently, at a distance of ''R'' astronomical units (''R'' thus being dimensionless), applying the [[inverse square law]], we would find:

:&lt;math&gt; P  = \frac{G_\text{SC}}{c R^2} \cos^2 \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, considering not an absorbing but a perfectly reflecting surface, the pressure is ''doubled'' due to the reflected wave, resulting in:

:&lt;math&gt; P  = 2\frac{G_\text{SC}}{c R^2} \cos^2 \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

Note that unlike the case of an absorbing material, the resulting force on a reflecting body is given exactly by this pressure acting normal to the surface, with the tangential forces from the incident and reflecting waves canceling each other. In practice, materials are neither totally reflecting nor totally absorbing, so the resulting force will be a weighted average of the forces calculated using these formulae.

===Radiation pressure perturbations===
{{See also|Yarkovsky effect|YORP effect|Poynting‚ÄìRobertson effect}}

Solar radiation pressure is a source of [[Perturbation (astronomy)|orbital perturbations]].  It significantly affects the orbits and trajectories of small bodies including all spacecraft.

Solar radiation pressure affects bodies throughout much of the Solar System.  Small bodies are more affected than large because of their lower mass relative to their surface area.  Spacecraft are affected along with natural bodies (comets, asteroids, dust grains, gas molecules).

The radiation pressure results in forces and torques on the bodies that can change their translational and rotational motions.  Translational changes affect the orbits of the bodies.  Rotational rates may increase or decrease.  Loosely aggregated bodies may break apart under high rotation rates.  Dust grains can either leave the Solar System or spiral into the Sun.

A whole body is typically composed of numerous surfaces that have different orientations on the body.  The facets may be flat or curved.  They will have different areas.  They may have optical properties differing from other aspects.

At any particular time, some facets will be exposed to the Sun and some will be in shadow.  Each surface exposed to the Sun will be reflecting, absorbing, and emitting radiation.  Facets in shadow will be emitting radiation.  The summation of pressures across all of the facets will define the net force and torque on the body.  These can be calculated using the equations in the preceding sections.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RMG" /&gt;

The [[Yarkovsky effect]] affects the translation of a small body.  It results from a face leaving solar exposure being at a higher temperature than a face approaching solar exposure.  The radiation emitted from the warmer face will be more intense than that of the opposite face, resulting in a net force on the body that will affect its motion.

The [[YORP effect]] is a collection of effects expanding upon the earlier concept of the Yarkovsky effect, but of a similar nature.  It affects the spin properties of bodies.

The [[Poynting‚ÄìRobertson effect]] applies to grain-size particles.  From the perspective of a grain of dust circling the Sun, the Sun's radiation appears to be coming from a slightly forward direction ([[aberration of light]]). Therefore, the absorption of this radiation leads to a force with a component against the direction of movement. (The angle of aberration is tiny since the radiation is moving at the speed of light while the dust grain is moving many orders of magnitude slower than that.)  The result is a gradual spiral of dust grains into the Sun.  Over long periods of time, this effect cleans out much of the dust in the Solar System.

While rather small in comparison to other forces, the radiation pressure force is inexorable.  Over long periods of time, the net effect of the force is substantial.  Such feeble pressures can produce marked effects upon minute particles like [[gas]] [[ion]]s and [[electron]]s, and are essential in the theory of electron emission from the Sun, of [[comet]]ary material, and so on.

Because the ratio of surface area to volume (and thus mass) increases with decreasing particle size, dusty ([[micrometre]]-size) particles are susceptible to radiation pressure even in the outer solar system.  For example, the evolution of the [[Rings of Saturn#Outer rings|outer rings of Saturn]] is significantly influenced by radiation pressure.

As a consequence of light pressure, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Einstein, A.|title=On the development of our views concerning the nature and constitution of radiation. Translated in: The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, vol. 2 (Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1989)|date=1909|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1909 predicted the existence of "radiation friction" which would oppose the movement of matter. He wrote, ‚Äúradiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The backward acting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant 'radiation friction' in brief.‚Äù

===Solar sails===
{{main|Solar sail}}
Solar sailing, an experimental method of [[spacecraft propulsion]], uses radiation pressure from the Sun as a motive force. The idea of interplanetary travel by light was mentioned by [[Jules Verne]] in ''From the Earth to the Moon''.

A sail reflects about 90% of the incident radiation.  The 10% that is absorbed is radiated away from both surfaces, with the proportion emitted from the unlit surface depending on the thermal conductivity of the sail.  A sail has curvature, surface irregularities, and other minor factors that affect its performance.

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ([[JAXA]]) has successfully unfurled a solar sail in space which has already succeeded in propelling its payload with the [[IKAROS]] project.

==Cosmic effects of radiation pressure==

Radiation pressure has had a major effect on the development of the cosmos, from the birth of the universe to ongoing formation of stars and shaping of clouds of dust and gasses on a wide range of scales.

===The early universe===

The [[photon epoch]] is a phase when the energy of the universe was dominated by photons, between 10 seconds and 380,000 years after the [[Big Bang]].

===Galaxy formation and evolution===

The process of [[galaxy formation and evolution]] began early in the history of the cosmos. Observations of the early universe strongly suggest that objects grew from bottom-up (i.e., smaller objects merging to form larger ones). As stars are thereby formed and become sources of electromagnetic radiation, radiation pressure from the stars becomes a factor in the dynamics of remaining [[Circumstellar disc|circumstellar]] material.

===Clouds of dust and gases===
[[File:Pillars 2014 HST denoise 0.6 12.jpg|thumb|The ''Pillars of Creation'' clouds within the [[Eagle Nebula]] shaped by radiation pressure and stellar winds.]]
The [[gravitational compression]] of clouds of dust and gases is strongly influenced by radiation pressure, especially when the condensations lead to star births.  The larger young stars forming within the compressed clouds emit intense levels of radiation that shift the clouds, causing either dispersion or condensations in nearby regions, which influences birth rates in those nearby regions.

===Clusters of stars===
&lt;!--[[File:M92 arp 750pix.jpg|thumb|250px|Star cluster [[Messier 92]].]]--&gt;
Stars predominantly form in regions of large clouds of dust and gases, giving rise to [[star cluster]]s.  Radiation pressure from the member stars eventually disperses the clouds, which can have a profound effect on the evolution of the cluster.

Many [[open cluster]]s are inherently unstable, with a small enough mass that the [[escape velocity]] of the system is lower than the average [[velocity]] of the constituent stars. These clusters will rapidly disperse within a few million years. In many cases, the stripping away of the gas from which the cluster formed by the radiation pressure of the hot young stars reduces the cluster mass enough to allow rapid dispersal.

===Star formation===

[[Star formation]] is the process by which dense regions within [[molecular cloud]]s in [[interstellar space]] collapse to form [[star]]s. As a branch of [[astronomy]], star formation includes the study of the [[interstellar medium]] and [[giant molecular cloud]]s (GMC) as precursors to the star formation process, and the study of [[protostar]]s and [[young stellar object]]s as its immediate products.  Star formation theory, as well as accounting for the formation of a single star, must also account for the statistics of [[binary star]]s and the [[initial mass function]].

===Stellar planetary systems===
[[File:David A. Aguilar's Red Dwarf Stars.jpg|thumb|A protoplanetary disk with a cleared central region (artist's conception).]]
[[Planetary system]]s are generally believed to form as part of the same process that results in [[star formation]]. A [[protoplanetary disk]] forms by gravitational collapse of a [[molecular cloud]], called a [[solar nebula]],  and then evolves into a planetary system by collisions and gravitational capture. Radiation pressure can clear a region in the immediate vicinity of the star. As the formation process continues, radiation pressure continues to play a role in affecting the distribution of matter.  In particular, dust and grains can spiral into the star or escape the stellar system under the action of radiation pressure.

===Stellar interiors===

In [[star|stellar]] interiors the temperatures are very high. Stellar models predict a temperature of 15&amp;nbsp;MK in the center of the [[Sun]], and at the cores of [[supergiant]] stars the temperature may exceed 1&amp;nbsp;GK. As the radiation pressure scales as the fourth power of the temperature, it becomes important at these high temperatures. In the Sun, radiation pressure is still quite small when compared to the gas pressure. In the heaviest non-degenerate stars, radiation pressure is the dominant pressure component.&lt;ref&gt;Dale A. Ostlie and Bradley W. Carroll, ''An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics'' (2nd edition), page 341, Pearson, San Francisco, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comets===
[[File:Comet Hale-Bopp 1995O1.jpg|thumb|[[Comet Hale‚ÄìBopp]] (C/1995 O1). Radiation pressure and solar wind effects on the dust and gas tails are clearly seen.]]
Solar radiation pressure strongly affects [[comet tail]]s.  Solar heating causes gases to be released from the [[comet nucleus]], which also carry away dust grains.  Radiation pressure and [[solar wind]] then drive the dust and gases away from the Sun's direction.  The gases form a generally straight tail, while slower moving dust particles create a broader, curving tail.

== Laser applications of radiation pressure==

=== Optical tweezers===

Lasers can be used as a source of monochromatic light with wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. With a set of lenses, one can focus the laser beam to a point that is &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; in diameter (or &lt;math&gt;r = \frac{\lambda}{2}&lt;/math&gt;). 

The radiation pressure of a 30 mW laser of 1064 nm can therefore be computed as follows: 

&lt;math&gt;A_{rea} = \pi\left(\frac{\lambda}{2}\right)^2 \approx 10^{-12} \text{ m}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F_{orce} = \frac{P_{ower}} {c} = \frac{30 \text{ mW}} {299792458 \text{ m/s}} \approx 10^{-10} \text{ N}  &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P_{ressure} = \frac{F_{orce}} {A_{rea}} \approx \frac{10^{-10} \text{ N}} {10^{-12} \text{ m}^2} = 100 \text{ Pascal}&lt;/math&gt;

This is used in [[optical tweezers]]. 

=== Other examples===
[[Laser cooling]] is applied to cooling materials very close to absolute zero.  Atoms traveling towards a laser light source perceive a [[doppler effect]] tuned to the absorption frequency of the target element. The radiation pressure on the atom slows movement in a particular direction until the Doppler effect moves out of the frequency range of the element, causing an overall cooling effect.

Large lasers operating in space have been suggested as a means of propelling sail craft in [[beam-powered propulsion]].

The reflection of a laser pulse from the surface of an elastic solid gives rise to various types of elastic waves that propagate inside the solid. The weakest waves are generally those that are generated by the radiation pressure acting during the reflection of the light. Recently, such light-pressure-induced elastic waves were observed inside an ultrahigh-reflectivity [[dielectric mirror]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Po≈æar |first1=T. |last2=Mo≈æina |first2=J. |title=Measurement of Elastic Waves Induced by the Reflection of Light. |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=111 |issue=18 |page=185501 |doi=10.1103/Physrevlett.111.185501}}&lt;/ref&gt; These waves are the most basic fingerprint of a light-solid matter interaction on the macroscopic scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Po≈æar |first1=T. |last2=Lalo≈° |first2=J. |last3=Babnik |first3=A. |last4=Petkov≈°ek |first4=R. |last5=Bethune-Waddell |first5=M. |last6=Chau |first6=K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12209">The '''Regional Studies Association''' ('''RSA''') is an international learned society that is concerned with the analysis of regions and regional issues. The Regional Studies Association works with its international and interdisciplinary membership to facilitate the highest standards of theoretical development, empirical analysis and policy debate of issues at this sub-national scale, incorporating both the urban and rural and different conceptions of space such as city regions and interstitial spaces. We are, for example, interested in issues of economic development and growth, conceptions of territory and its governance and in thorny problems of equity and injustice.

[[File:RSA logo.jpg|thumb|Regional Studies Association logo]]

It runs a programme of international conferences and events based on excellence that has been growing steadily over the years and plays a major role in the Association‚Äôs aim in supporting its members disseminate their research. These events also create debates and offer opportunities for those who wish to be part of a community where high quality events are also the place to network within a friendly atmosphere, present their work to international audiences and strengthen their careers. In 2017, the RSA organised events in Ireland, Brazil, China, Romania, Belgium, Australia, UK &amp; Russia. The RSA was a key partner in the European Week of Regions and Cities and we were coordinating the #EURegionsWeek 2017 University sessions and EU Cohesion Policy Master Class. 

The association publishes 5 journals with the publisher [[Taylor and Francis]]: [[Regional Studies (journal) |''Regional Studies'']],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=cres20|title=Regional Studies :|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Spatial Economic Analysis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=rsea20|title=Spatial Economic Analysis :|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Territory, Politics, Governance'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=rtep20|title=Territory, Politics, Governance :|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[open access journal]] ''Regional Studies, Regional Science'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=rsrs20|title=Regional Studies, Regional Science :|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Area Development and Policy'', that engages with the transformation of the modern world as a result of development of the global South/Greater [[BRICS]]. The ''Regions and Cities'' Book Series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfbuiltenvironment.com/books/series/Regions_and_Cities|title=Built Environment - Routledge|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is published by [[Routledge]] in association with the RSA. The Book Series Editor-in-Chief is Joan Fitzgerald (Northeastern University, USA). ''Regions'' magazine is the membership magazine and the voice of the RSA membership.

It has allocated financial resources to support its members and offer a range of funding opportunities to suit different career stages. These opportunities provide members with the chance to apply for financial help to support their research, run networking events, receive awards for excellence and help towards the costs of travel to attend non-RSA events and present their work to international audiences. The RSA offers the following funding opportunities: '''Travel Grant''' up to ¬£500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/rsa-travel-grant|title=RSA Travel Grant}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Policy Expo'''  up to ¬£15,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/policy-expo-grant-scheme|title=RSA Policy Expo Grant Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Membership Research Grant (MeRSA)''' up to ¬£5,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/rsa-MeRSA-Grant|title=RSA Membership Research Grant Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Fellowship Research Grant (FeRSA)''' up to ¬£7,500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/rsa-fellowship-research-grant-scheme|title=RSA Fellowship Research Grant Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Early Career Research Grant''' up to ¬£10,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/early-career-grant-scheme|title=RSA Early Career Research Grant Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Research Network Grant Scheme''' up to ¬£10,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/research-network-grants|title=RSA Research network grant}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The RSA's Research Networks are formed by RSA members to organise a series of events to examine an issue of collective interest. 

There is an extensive '''international network''' of around 70 Ambassadors, five Divisions (China, Latin America, Northern Europe, India and Russia), five country Sections (Hungary, Poland, Scotland, Ireland and Wales) and six UK regional Branches which support members in their own locales. We also have a non-profit Foundation in Belgium (RSA Europe). These international networks work together with the Association to expend the opportunities and benefits offered to its members but also to those who do not yet know the Association. These networks are set up to organise a range of activities that are open to all to attend and they have the role of informing and disseminating information on regional studies at a regional and/or national level. They also act as an invaluable link to the Association for those who work in a language other than English but also for those who cannot attend all the major events directly organised by the Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/networks|title=RSA International Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The RSA's Chair is Professor Mark Tewdwr-Jones, Director of Newcastle City Futures and Chair of Town Planning, Newcastle University, UK. The RSA‚Äôs previous Chair (2012-2017) was Professor Andrew Beer, Dean, Research &amp; Innovation at UniSA Business School, Australia. He succeeded Professor [[David Bailey (academic economist and commentator)|David Bailey]] who served as Chair over 2006‚Äì12. Sally Hardy is Chief Executive for the past 30 years. The RSA President is Ron Martin, University of Cambridge, UK. The previous RSA President was [[Peter Hall (urbanist)|Sir Peter Hall]] until 2014.

[[Peter Hall (urbanist)|Sir Peter Hall]] was awarded the RSA's Prize for Outstanding Contribution to the field of Regional Studies at the RSA's Presidential Lunch held at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in September 2008. In subsequent years the association has awarded an annual Sir Peter Hall Prize for outstanding contribution to the field of Regional Studies, with recipients including Ann Markusen, John Bachtler, John Goddard, [[Michael Storper]], [[Allen J. Scott]], Ray Hudson, Brian Robson, Susan Christopherson and [[Saskia Sassen]]  in 2017. The RSA also awards excellence in the field with its Best Book Award, Nathaniel Lichfield Award, RSA and Routledge Early Career Award, as well as its Best Paper and Best Referee Awards for all its academic journals (''Regional Studies; Spatial Economic Analysis; Territory, Politics, Governance; Regional Studies, Regional Science; Area Development and Policy'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding|title=RSA Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The RSA is a member society of the Academy of Social Sciences, previously known as the [[Academy of Learned Societies in the Social Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acss.org.uk/about6.htm |title=Academy of Social Sciences |publisher=Acss.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association is also a recognised United Nations NGO with Consultative Status (ECOSOC).

{{TOC right}}

==Definition==
A regional park can be a special park district covering a region crossing several jurisdiction boundaries, or a park system of a single jurisdiction, such as a province, county, or city.

==By country==

===Canada===

====Saskatchewan====
There are 101 regional parks in Saskatchewan. All parks are operated by volunteer boards.

===Italy===
{{See also|List of regional parks of Italy}}
Regional parks in Italy are administered by each [[Regions of Italy|region in Italy]], a government unit like a U.S. state.

===New Zealand===
{{Main article|Regional parks of New Zealand}}
In [[New Zealand]], regional parks are administered by [[Regions of New Zealand|regional councils]] rather than the [[New Zealand Department of Conservation|Department of Conservation]] or [[territorial authority|territorial authorities]].

===United States===

====Definitions====
In the United States, a regional park is sometimes referred to as a 'Metropolitan Park (Metropark)' or as an [[open space reserve]]. The terms ''region'' and ''metropolitan'' can have different meanings in U.S. local government agencies. Regional parks can be administered by a regional park board, a [[U.S. state|state]], [[county#United States|county]] or other units of [[local government]]. A special authority can be set up, under the joint jurisdiction of two or more government bodies or as an independent park district to administer parks. Individual parks may or may not cross governmental boundaries. The park district holds the authority, similar to fire protection districts, to manage and raise taxes to cover park acquisition and management costs.

====Midwest====
{{See also|List of county and regional parks in Minnesota}}
In Ohio, under [[Ohio Revised Code]] Chapter 1545, metro parks such as the [[Metro Parks (Columbus, Ohio)|Columbus and Franklin County Metro Parks]] can have their own [[police officer|sworn police forces]] ([[park ranger|rangers]]); The [[Cleveland Metroparks]] and [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]] [[Five Rivers Metroparks]] are also in the state. Other examples of large regional park systems are the [[Huron-Clinton Metroparks]] in southeast [[Michigan]]; and the [[Three Rivers Park District]] in [[Minnesota]].

====California====
{{See also|Category:Regional parks in California}}
The [[East Bay Regional Park District]] and [[Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District]] have extensive parklands in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], protecting habitat and offering recreation.

===United Kingdom===
====Scotland====
In [[Scotland]], regional parks are defined to co-ordinate the management of areas of attractive countryside that are of importance for recreation due to their proximity to population centres. The parks have been defined and are managed by [[subdivisions of Scotland|local authorities]].  Currently Scotland has three regional parks:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/safeguarding-protected-areas-and-species/protected-areas/local-designations/regional-parks|title=Regional parks|publisher=Scottish Natural Heritage|accessdate=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 &lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:usralogo.png|thumb| 80 px| USRA Logo ]] --&gt;
The '''Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science''' (RIACS)&lt;ref name=riacs/&gt; was founded June 1, 1983 as a joint collaboration between the  [[Universities Space Research Association]] (USRA) and the  [[NASA Ames Research Center]]. The Institute was created to conduct basic and applied research in computer science, covering a broad range of research topics of interest to the aerospace community including [[supercomputing]], [[computational fluid dynamics]], [[computational chemistry]], high performance networking, and [[artificial intelligence]].
 
Since its inception, a goal of the Institute‚Äôs research has been to support scientific research and engineering from problem formulation to results dissemination, combining concurrent processing systems with intelligent systems to allow users to interact in the language of their discipline.  This goal has since expanded to support a broad range of activities associated with space exploration and science, including mission operations and innovative information systems for technology research and development.

An underlying philosophy and approach of the Institute is that successful research is interdisciplinary, and that challenging applications associated with NASA‚Äôs mission provide a driving force for developing innovative information systems and advancing computer science. To implement this approach, research staff undertakes collaborative projects with research groups at NASA, integrating computer science with other disciplines to support NASA‚Äôs mission.

Over its nearly twenty five-year history, RIACS&lt;ref name=riacs&gt;http://www.riacs.edu&lt;/ref&gt; has acted as a bridge between academia and government research, engaging talented researchers from around the world to collaborate with NASA on challenging research topics. RIACS&lt;ref name=riacs/&gt; has also acted as a bridge between industry and the government to mature information technologies for infusion into NASA operations, enabling broader public benefit from research results.

For  NASA, RIACS&lt;ref name=riacs/&gt; has collaborated most closely with the Intelligent Systems Division and the  [[NASA Advanced Supercomputing facility|NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division]] (NAS) at the  [[NASA Ames Research Center]] ‚Äì NASA‚Äôs Center for Excellence in Information Technology. RIACS,&lt;ref name=riacs/&gt; which was formed the same year as the NAS, worked closely with the division in its early years to develop a strong competency in supercomputing and computational fluid dynamics at NASA.  RIACS&lt;ref name=riacs/&gt; helped establish the Intelligent Systems Division, and has since collaborated closely with the division to develop and infuse a number of software innovations in the areas of autonomous systems; intelligent information management and data understanding; and human-centered computing.

A '''scientific demonstration''' is a [[scientific experiment]] carried out for the purposes of demonstrating scientific principles, rather than for [[hypothesis testing]] or knowledge gathering (although they may originally have been carried out for these purposes).

Most scientific demonstrations are simple laboratory demonstrations intended to demonstrate physical principles, often in a surprising or entertaining way. They are carried out in schools and universities, and sometimes in public demonstrations in popular science lectures and TV programs aimed at the general public. Many scientific demonstrations are chosen for their combination of educational merit and entertainment value, which is often provided by dramatic phenomena such as explosions. 

Public scientific demonstrations were a common occurrence in the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and have long  been a feature of the British [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]], which date back to 1825. In the television era, scientific demonstrations have featured in science-related entertainment shows such as ''[[MythBusters]]'' and ''[[Brainiac: Science Abuse]]''.

==Examples==
Some famous scientific demonstrations include:

* [[Ab≈´ RayhƒÅn al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´|Al-Biruni]]'s [[reaction time]]
* [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]]'s [[camera obscura]], [[Oil lamp|lamp]] experiment and [[magnifying lens]]
* [[Al-Jazari]]'s [[crankshaft]], [[elephant clock]] and programmable [[robot]]s
* [[Ibn Zuhr|Avenzoar]]'s [[parasite]]s
* [[Detonation|Detonating]] a cloud of [[flour]]
* [[Foucault pendulum|Foucault's pendulum]]
* [[Galileo Galilei]]'s ball experiments, [[pendulum]] and [[telescope]]
* [[Heron's fountain]] and [[aeolipile]]
* [[Ibn al-Nafis]]' [[pulmonary circulation]] and [[coronary circulation]]
* [[Gyroscope|Gyroscopic]] [[bicycle wheel]]
* [[Nylon rope trick]] 
* [[Prince Rupert's Drop]]s
* Shooting a [[candle]] through a [[Plank (wood)|plank]]
* [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]]'s [[alarm clock]], [[steam turbine]]
* Using a [[linear motor]] as a gun
* Using compressed air to drive a [[water rocket]]
* Using [[liquid nitrogen]] to shatter a rose
* [[William Harvey]]'s [[circulatory system]]

Note: many scientific demonstrations are potentially dangerous, and should not be attempted without considerable laboratory experience and appropriate safety precautions. Many older well-known scientific demonstrations, once mainstays of science education, are now effectively impossible to demonstrate to an audience without breaking health and safety laws. Some older demonstrations, such as allowing the audience to play with liquid mercury, are sufficiently dangerous that they should not be attempted by anyone under any circumstances.

[[File:Prevailing world religions map.png|thumb|300px|Major denominations and religions of the world]]
A '''sect''' is a subgroup of a [[religion|religious]], [[politics|political]], or [[philosophy|philosophical]] belief system, usually an offshoot of a larger group. Although the term was originally a classification for religious separated groups, it can now refer to any organization that breaks away from a larger one to follow a different set of rules and principles.

In an [[India]]n context, sect refers to an organized tradition.&lt;ref name="sai.uni-heidelberg"/&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Catalogue of Sects.GIF|thumb|right|280px|''A Catalogue of the Severall Sects and Opinions in England and other Nations: With a briefe Rehearsall of their false and dangerous Tenents''. Broadsheet. 1647]]
The word ''sect'' comes from the [[Latin]] noun ''secta'' (a feminine form of a variant past participle of the verb ''sequi'', to follow&lt;ref name=oel_sect&gt;
{{cite web
| url         = https://www.etymonline.com/word/sect#etymonline_v_23088
| title       = sect (n.)
| work        = [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]
| publisher   = [[Douglas Harper]]
| accessdate  = 2018-11-03
| quote       = mid-14c., "distinctive system of beliefs or observances; party or school within a religion," from Old French secte, sete "sect, religious community," or directly from Late Latin secta "religious group, sect in philosophy or religion," from Latin secta "manner, mode, following, school of thought," literally "a way, road, beaten path," from fem. of sectus, variant past participle of sequi "follow," from PIE root *sekw- (1) "to follow." Confused in this sense with Latin secta, fem. past participle of secare "to cut" (from PIE root *sek- "to cut"). Meaning "separately organized religious body" is recorded from 1570s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), meaning "a way, road", and figuratively a (prescribed) way, mode, or manner, and hence [[metonym]]ously, a discipline or school of thought as defined by a set of methods and doctrines. The present gamut of meanings of ''sect'' has been influenced by confusion with the [[homonym]]ous (but etymologically unrelated) Latin word ''secta'' (the feminine form of the past participle of the verb ''[[Wikt:secare|secare]]'', to cut).&lt;ref name=oel_sect/&gt;

==Sociological definitions and descriptions==
{{Main article|Church-sect typology}}
There are several different sociological definitions and descriptions for the term.&lt;ref name="available online"&gt;McCormick Maaga, Mary excerpt from her book ''Hearing the Voices of [[Jonestown]]'' (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 1998) [http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=16596  available online]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first to define them were [[Max Weber]] and [[Ernst Troeltsch]] (1912).&lt;ref name="available online"/&gt; In the [[church-sect typology]] they are described as newly formed religious groups that form to protest elements of their parent religion (generally a [[Religious denomination|denomination]]). Their motivation tends to be situated in accusations of apostasy or [[heresy]] in the parent denomination; they are often decrying liberal trends in denominational development and advocating a return to true religion. The American [[sociology|sociologists]] [[Rodney Stark]] and [[William Sims Bainbridge]] assert that "sects claim to be authentic purged, refurbished version of the faith from which they split".&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodney Stark|Stark, Rodney]], and Williams Sims Bainbridge (1979) ''Of Churches, Sects, and Cults: Preliminary Concepts for a Theory of Religious Movements'' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 18, no 2: 117‚Äì33&lt;/ref&gt; They further assert that sects have, in contrast to churches, a high degree of tension with the surrounding society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodney Stark|Stark, Rodney]], and [[William Sims Bainbridge]] (1985) ''The Future of Religion: Secularization, Revival, and Cult formation'' Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; Other sociologists of religion such as Fred Kniss have asserted that sectarianism is best described with regard to what a sect is in tension with.  Some religious groups exist in tension only with co-religious groups of different ethnicities, or exist in tension with the whole of society rather than the church which the sect originated from.&lt;ref&gt;Kniss, Fred, and Numrich, Paul (2007) ''Sacred Assemblies and Civic Engagement''Rutgers University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sectarianism]] is sometimes defined in the [[sociology of religion]] as a worldview that emphasizes the unique legitimacy of believers' creed and practices and that heightens tension with the larger society by engaging in boundary-maintaining practices.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, Meredith B. "Religion: the Social Context" fifth edition (2002) {{ISBN|0-534-54126-7}} page 338&lt;/ref&gt;

The English sociologist [[Roy Wallis]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Eileen Barker|Barker, E]]. ''New Religious Movements: A Practical Introduction'' (1990), Bernan Press, {{ISBN|0-11-340927-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that a sect is characterized by "[[epistemology|epistemological]] authoritarianism": sects possess some authoritative locus for the legitimate attribution of heresy. According to Wallis, "sects lay a claim to possess unique and privileged access to the truth or salvation" and "their committed adherents typically regard all those outside the confines of the collectivity as 'in error'". He contrasts this with a [[cult]] that he described as characterized by "epistemological individualism" by which he means that "the cult has no clear locus of final authority beyond the individual member."&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Roy ''[[The Road to Total Freedom A Sociological analysis of Scientology]]'' (1976) [http://whyaretheydead.net/krasel/books/wallis/wallis1.html available online (bad scan)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405052348/http://whyaretheydead.net/krasel/books/wallis/wallis1.html |date=2008-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Roy ''Scientology: Therapeutic Cult to Religious Sect'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20060614094446/http://soc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/1/89 abstract only] (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other languages==
The corresponding words for "sect" in [[Europe]]an languages other than [[English language|English]] ‚Äì ''Sekte'' (German), ''secte'' (French), ''secta'' (Spanish, Catalan), ''sectƒÉ'' (Romanian), ''seita'' (Portuguese, Galician), ''sekta'' (Polish, Czech, Slovak, Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, Slovenian, Latvian, Lithuanian), ''sekt'' (Danish, Estonian, Norwegian, Swedish), ''sekte'' (Dutch) and ''szekta'' (Hungarian), ''—Å–µ–∫—Ç–∞'' (Russian, Serbian, Bulgarian) ‚Äì refer to a harmful religious sect and translate into English as "[[Cult|cult]]".{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} In [[France]], since the 1970s, ''secte'' has a specific meaning{{which|date=October 2014}} which is very different from the English word.&lt;ref&gt;Esquerre Arnaud, "Lutter contre les sectes: l‚Äôinvention d‚Äôun psycho-pouvoir", ''Le Banquet'', n¬∞24, f√©vrier 2007, p. 199-212&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quote|date=October 2014}}

==In Buddhism==
{{Main article|Schools of Buddhism}}
[[File:Japanese buddhist monk by Arashiyama.JPG|thumb|Japanese buddhist monk from the [[S≈çt≈ç Zen]] sect]]
The ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Religion'' distinguishes three types of classification of Buddhism, separated into "Movements", "NikƒÅyas" and "Doctrinal schools":
* Schools:
** [[Theravada]], ''primarily in [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]].''
** [[Mahayana|MahƒÅyƒÅna]], ''primarily in [[East Asia]].''
** [[Vajrayana|VajrayƒÅna]], ''primarily in [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]], [[India]], [[Mongolia]] and the Russian republic of [[Kalmykia]].''
* [[NikƒÅya]]s, or monastic fraternities, three of which survive at the present day:
** [[Theravada|TheravƒÅda]], in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]]
** [[Dharmaguptaka]], in [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]]
** [[Mulasarvastivada|M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda]], in the Tibetan tradition

==In Christianity==
{{see also|List of Christian denominations|Christian denomination}}
While the historical usage of the term "sect" in [[Christendom]] has had [[pejorative]] connotations, referring to a group or movement with [[Christian heresy|heretical]] beliefs or practices that deviate from those of groups considered orthodox,&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan R. Wilson|Wilson, Bryan]] ''Religion in Sociological Perspective'' 1982, {{ISBN|0-19-826664-2}} [[Oxford University Press]] page 89&lt;br&gt;
"In English, it is a term that designates a religiously separated group, but in its historical usage in Christendom it carried a distinctly pejorative connotation. A sect was a movement committed to heretical beliefs and often to ritual acts and practices like isolation that departed from orthodox religious procedures."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Sect and Sects}}&lt;/ref&gt; its primary meaning is to indicate a community which has separated itself in some way from the larger body from which its members came and to which they may or may not still adhere. The term remains valid for this purpose.

===Roman Catholic sects===
There are many groups outside the Roman Catholic Church which regard themselves as Catholic, such as the [[Community of the Lady of All Nations]], the [[Palmarian Catholic Church]], the [[Philippine Independent Church]], the [[Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church]], the [[Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God]], [[Most Holy Family Monastery]], and others.

===Protestant sects===
{{See also|List of the largest Protestant denominations}}

==In Hinduism==
{{Main article|Hindu denominations}}
[[File:Ganapati.1..JPG|thumb|[[Ganesha]] worshippers]]
The [[Indology|Indologist]] [[Axel Michaels]] writes in his book about [[Hinduism]] that in an Indian context the word "sect does not denote a split or excluded community, but rather an organized tradition, usually established by founder with ascetic practices."&lt;ref name="sai.uni-heidelberg"&gt;{{cite book | title = Hinduism past and Present (2004) translated from German "Der Hinduismus" (1998)| first=Axel| last=Michaels| author-link=Axel Michaels| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn=0-691-08952-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Michaels, "Indian sects do not focus on heresy, since the lack of a center or a compulsory center makes this impossible ‚Äì instead, the focus is on adherents and followers."&lt;ref name="sai.uni-heidelberg"/&gt;

==In Islam==
{{Main article|Islamic schools and branches|fiqh|madhhab}}
The ancient schools of [[fiqh]] or [[sharia]] in [[Islam]] are known as "[[madhhab]]s." In the beginning Islam was classically divided into three major sects. These political divisions are well known as [[Sunni Islam]], [[Shia Islam]] and [[Khawarij|Khariji Islam]]. Each sect developed several distinct jurisprudence systems reflecting their own understanding of the Islamic law during the course of the [[history of Islam]].

For instance, Sunnis are separated into five sub-sects, namely, [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]] and [[·∫íƒÅhirƒ´]].

The Shia, on the other hand, first developed [[Kaysanites|Kaysanism]], which in turn divided into three major groupings known as [[Fivers]], [[Seveners]] and [[Twelvers]]. The [[Zaidiyyah|Zaydis]] separated first. The non-Zaydis are initially called as "[[Rafida]] Groups." These [[Rafidi]]s were later divided into two sub-groups known as [[Imamiyyah]] and [[Batiniyyah]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ahmed Cevdet Pasha]], ''Kƒ±sas-ƒ± Enbiy√¢,'' vol. II, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The "[[Imami]]-[[Shi'a]]" later brought into existence [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]]. [[Akhbari]]sm, [[Usuli]]sm, and [[Shaykhism]] were all ensued as variations of "Ja'fari fiqh," while [[Alawites]] and [[Alevis]] who are not the strict followers of "Ja'farism" are developed separately from the teachings of ''[[Ithna'ashari]] [[ImƒÅm]]s.''[[File:Ghardaia02.jpg|thumb|[[M'zab]] valley in Sahara is home of the [[Ibadi]] religious sect]]
*[[Batiniyya]] groups, on the other hand, were divided into two sub-groups known as [[Sevener]]s and [[IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´]]s. [[Qarmatians]] who did not follow the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] were branched from the [[Seveners]]. Those groups of [[Batiniyya]] who followed the [[Fatimids]] are the ancestors of today's [[IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´]]s. [[Druze]] was emerged as an offshoot of IsmƒÅ øƒ´lism at the beginning of the 11th Century. [[Isma'ilism]] at the end of the 11th Century split into two major branches known as [[NizƒÅrƒ´ IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´]] ''([[Assassins]] of [[Alamut]])'' and [[Musta‚Äôli Ismaili]]. As a result of the assassination of [[Fatimid Caliph]] [[Al-Amir bi-Ahkami'l-Lah]], [[Mustaali]] was once more again divided into [[Hafizi]]s and [[Taiyabi Ismaili]]s ''([[Dawoodi Bohra|Dawoodis]], [[Sulaymani]]s and [[Alavi Bohra|Alavis]])''
* The Khawarij were initially divided into five major branches: [[Sufri]]s, [[Azariqa]], [[Najdat]], Adjarites and [[Ibadi]]s.

The Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali Sunnis, the Twelver groups, the IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´ groups, the Zaydis, the Ibadis, and the ·∫íƒÅhirƒ´s continue to exist. In addition, new sects like [[Ahmadiyya movement]], [[Islam in the United States#Black Muslim movements|Black Muslim movements]], [[Quranists]], [[Salafis]], [[Wahhabis]], and [[Zikris]] have been emerged independently.

=== Amman Message ===
{{main article||Amman Message}}
{{further information|Islamic denominations}}
An Islamic convention held in [[Jordan]] in July 2005, which brought 200 Muslim scholars from over 50 countries together, announced the official recognition of eight [[Madhhab|schools]] of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ammanmessage.com/ The Amman Message summary] ‚Äì Official website&lt;/ref&gt; and the varying [[schools of Islamic theology]].&lt;ref name="3Points"&gt;[http://ammanmessage.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=91&amp;Itemid=74 The Three Points of The [[Amman Message]] V.1]&lt;/ref&gt; The eight recognized [[List of Islamic schools and branches|Islamic schools and branches]] are:

Cliffie Stone played bass on the recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrydiscography.blogspot.com/2010/03/merle-travis.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519095032/http://countrydiscography.blogspot.com/2010/03/merle-travis.html |archivedate=May 19, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first released in July 1947 by [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] on Travis' album ''[[Folk Songs of the Hills]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Billboard |date=June 28, 1947|title= Advance Record Releases| page= 119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The song became a [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]].

The line "You load sixteen tons and what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt" came from a letter written by Travis' brother John.&lt;ref name="ernieford.com"/&gt; Another line came from their father, a coal miner, who would say: "I can't afford to die. I owe my soul to the [[company store]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=LIFE |date=December 5, 1955 |title=You Load 16 Tons... Coal Mine Song Is a Gold Mine| page= 183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1955 version recorded by [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] reached number one in the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts,&lt;ref name=pc9/&gt; while another version by [[Frankie Laine]] 1956 was released only in Western Europe, where it gave Ford's version competition.

On March 25, 2015, Ford's version of the song was inducted into the [[National Recording Registry|Library of Congress's National Recording Registry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2015/15-041.html | title=National Recording Registry To "Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive" | work=the Library of Congress | date=25 March 2015 | accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
The sole authorship of "Sixteen Tons" is attributed to [[Merle Travis]] on all recordings&lt;ref name=pc9/&gt; beginning with Travis' own 1946 record and is registered with [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] as a Merle Travis composition. [[George S. Davis]], a [[folk singer]] and songwriter who had been a Kentucky coal miner, claimed on a 1966 recording for [[Folkways Records]] to have written the song as "Nine-to-ten tons" in the 1930s;&lt;ref&gt;John Cohen, liner notes to the album ''George Davis: When Kentucky Had No Mining Men'' (Folkways FA 2343, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; he also at different times claimed to have written the song as "Twenty-One Tons".  There is no supporting evidence for Davis' claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.steynonline.com/4434/sixteen-tons|title=SIXTEEN TONS|first=Mark|last=Steyn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Davis' 1966 recording of his version of the song (with some slightly different lyrics and tune, but titled "Sixteen Tons") appears on the albums ''George Davis: When Kentucky Had No Union Men''&lt;ref&gt;Folkways FA 2343, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Classic Mountain Songs from Smithsonian''.&lt;ref&gt;Folkways Recordings ASIN B000S9DIHK, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Travis, the line "another day older and deeper in debt" from the chorus was a phrase often used by his father, a coal miner himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/full-list-of-inductees/view/merle-travis |title=Full List of Inductees |publisher=Country Music Hall of Fame |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106031653/http://countrymusichalloffame.org/full-list-of-inductees/view/merle-travis |archivedate=November 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This and the line "I owe my soul to the [[company store]]" are a reference to the [[truck system]] and to [[debt bondage]]. Under this [[scrip]] system, workers were not paid cash; rather they were paid with non-transferable credit vouchers that could be exchanged only for goods sold at the company store. This made it impossible for workers to store up cash savings. Workers also usually lived in company-owned dormitories or houses, the rent for which was automatically deducted from their pay. In the United States the truck system and associated debt bondage persisted until the strikes of the newly formed [[United Mine Workers]] and affiliated [[labour union|unions]] forced an end to such practices.

==Other versions==
[[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] recorded "Sixteen Tons" in 1955 as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of his cover of the [[Moon Mullican]] standard "[[You Don't Have to Be a Baby to Cry]]". With Ford's snapping fingers and a unique clarinet-driven pop arrangement, it quickly became a million seller.&lt;ref name=pc9&gt;{{Pop Chronicles|9|2|Merle Travis &amp; Ernie Ford}}&lt;/ref&gt; It hit [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s [[country music]] chart in November and held the No. 1 position for ten weeks, then crossed over and held the number 1 position on the pop music chart for eight weeks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Ace | last= Collins| year= 1996| title= The Stories Behind Country Music's All-time Greatest: 100 Songs| publisher= The Berkeley Publishing Group| location=New York| pages= 91‚Äì93| isbn=1-57297-072-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; besting the competing version by [[Johnny Desmond]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], Ford's version competed with versions by [[Edmund Hockridge]] and [[Frankie Laine]]. Nevertheless, Ford's version was the more successful, spending four weeks at number 1 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in January and February 1956.&lt;ref name="500 Number One Hits"&gt;{{cite book

The '''Swarm Development Group''' ('''SDG''') is an American non-profit organization to advance the development of [[complex adaptive system]]-oriented [[agent-based model]]ing (ABM) tools initiated at the [[Santa Fe Institute]] (SFI) in Santa Fe, New Mexico, US. It was formed in 1999 by a group of multidisciplinary scientists, researchers, and software developers, led by [[Chris Langton]]. Langton was also the founder of the emerging field of research called [[artificial life]].  The initial, primary, role for the SDG was to house continued development of the [[Swarm (simulation)|Swarm]] simulation software after the software become independent of the SFI in 1999.

The role of the Swarm Development Group, has since expanded to include the co-ordination of a long-running conference SwarmFest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swarm.org/wiki/Swarm:_SwarmFest SwarmFest]&lt;/ref&gt; during May, June, or July each summer ‚Äì typically hosted by a different research university each year. Developers, users, and researchers gather to present research papers and discuss the state of Swarm and other agent-based modeling platforms like [[Repast (modeling toolkit)|RePast]] (University of Chicago) and Ascape&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/es/dynamics/models/ascape/ Ascape]&lt;/ref&gt; (Brookings).  Typically, a wide range of academic, corporate, and government organizations are represented at SwarmFest.   The first SwarmFest was in 1998 while Swarm was still sponsored by the Santa Fe Institute.   From SwarmFest 2000 onwards, after the SDG was formed in late 1999, SwarmFests were organized directly by the SDG.

Recent SwarmFests have been held at a variety of institutions.  SwarmFest 2007 was held at DePaul University's School of Computer Science, Telecommunications, and Information Systems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.depaul.edu/news/default.asp School of Computer Science, Telecommunications, and Information Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; in downtown Chicago, Illinois.  SwarmFest 2008 was held at Northwestern Memorial Hospital/Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, in downtown Chicago, Illinois.  Swarmfest 2008 had special focus areas on [[agent based modeling]] in [[Systems Biology]], and the implementation of [[agent based model]]s in [[high-performance computing]] environments. Between 2009 and 2012, SwarmFest was held at the Santa Fe Complex in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].  Swarmfest 2013 was held at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida July 8‚Äì9.;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.ucf.edu/swarmfest2013.html SwarmFest2013]&lt;/ref&gt; SwarmFest 2014 was held at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, IN from June 29 ‚Äì July 1, 2014;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swarmfest2014.org/ |title=SwarmFest2014 |accessdate=2014-05-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509001230/http://www.swarmfest2014.org/ |archivedate=May 9, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the University of South Carolina in Columbia, SC (in 2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swarmfest2015.org/ |title=SwarmFest2015 |accessdate=2018-02-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117084740/http://www.swarmfest2015.org/ |archivedate=January 17, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the University of Vermont in Burlington, VT (in 2016),&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/swarmfest2016/ SwarmFest2016]&lt;/ref&gt; and Old Dominion University in Suffolk, VA (in 2017),&lt;ref&gt;[http://swarmfest2017.org/ SwarmFest2017]&lt;/ref&gt; were the selected venues.

'''System integration''' is defined in [[engineering]] as the process of bringing together the component sub-[[system]]s into one system (an aggregation of subsystems cooperating so that the system is able to deliver the overarching functionality) and ensuring that the subsystems function together as a system,&lt;ref name="Heat"&gt;{{Citation| last = Gilkey| first = Herbert T | year = 1960| contribution = New Air Heating Methods| title= New methods of heating buildings: a research correlation conference conducted by the Building Research Institute, Division of Engineering and Industrial Research, as one of the programs of the BRI fall conferences, November 1959.| publisher=National Research Council (U.S.). Building Research Institute| place=Washington | pages = 60 | oclc =184031}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[information technology]]&lt;ref&gt;For computer systems, the term "systems integration" has included the plural word "systems" although the singular form has also been used in referring to computer systems.&lt;/ref&gt; as the process of linking together different [[computing]] systems and [[software]] [[software application|applications]] physically or functionally,&lt;ref name="SICourse"&gt;{{Citation| title=CIS 8020 ‚Äì Systems Integration| publisher=Georgia State University OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; to act as a coordinated whole.

The [[system integrator]] [[data integration|integrates]] discrete systems utilizing a variety of techniques such as [[computer network]]ing, [[enterprise application integration]], [[business process management]] or manual [[Computer programming|programming]].&lt;ref name="Info"&gt;{{Citation| last=Moore | first=June | date =13 December 1982| contribution= Software Reviews, BusinessMaster II+, ledger for CP/M systems| title=InfoWorld | publisher=InfoWorld Media Group, Inc| page = 31 | issn=0199-6649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

System integration involves integrating existing, often [[disparate system]]s in such a way "that focuses on increasing value to the customer"&lt;ref name="VonderembseAPost97"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A post-industrial paradigm: To integrate and automate manufacturing |journal=International Journal of Production Research |author=Vonderembse, M.A.; Raghunathan, T.S.; Rao, S.S. |volume=35 |issue=9 |pages=2579‚Äì2600 |year=1997 |doi=10.1080/002075497194679}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., improved product quality and performance) while at the same time providing value to the company (e.g., reducing operational costs and improving response time).&lt;ref name="VonderembseAPost97" /&gt; In the modern world connected by [[Internet]], the role of system integration engineers is important: more and more systems are designed to connect, both within the system under construction and to systems that are already deployed.&lt;ref name="Info2"&gt;{{Citation | last = Merriman| first = Dan| date =19 Feb 1996| contribution = Tying it all together |title=Network World|publisher=IDG Network World Inc| pages = 51|ISSN= 0887-7661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of integration==
'''[[Vertical integration]]''' (as opposed to "[[horizontal integration]]") is the process of integrating subsystems according to their functionality by creating functional entities also referred to as [[Information silo|silos]].&lt;ref name="E-gov"&gt;{{Citation | last = Lau| first = Edwin | year =2005
| contribution = Multi-channel Service Delivery|title=OECD e-Government Studies e-Government for Better Government|publisher=OECD| place =Paris|pages = 52|oclc =224889830}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefit of this method is that the integration is performed quickly and involves only the necessary vendors, therefore, this method is cheaper in the short term. On the other hand, cost-of-ownership can be substantially higher than seen in other methods, since in case of new or enhanced functionality, the only possible way to implement (scale the system) would be by implementing another silo. Reusing subsystems to create another functionality is not possible.&lt;ref name="Integ"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Gold-Bernstein| first1 = Beth| last2 = Ruh| first2 = William A| year =2005|title=Enterprise integration: the essential guide to integration solutions|publisher=Addison Wesley|ISBN= 0-321-22390-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Star integration''', also known as '''spaghetti integration''', is a process of systems integration where each system is interconnected to each of the remaining subsystems. When observed from the perspective of the subsystem which is being integrated, the connections are reminiscent of a star, but when the overall diagram of the system is presented, the connections look like spaghetti, hence the name of this method. The cost varies because of the interfaces that subsystems are exporting. In a case where the subsystems are exporting heterogeneous or proprietary interfaces, the integration cost can substantially rise. Time and costs needed to integrate the systems increase exponentially when adding additional subsystems. From the feature perspective, this method often seems preferable, due to the extreme flexibility of the reuse of functionality.&lt;ref name="Integ"/&gt;

'''Horizontal integration''' or '''[[Enterprise Service Bus]]''' (ESB) is an integration method in which a specialized subsystem is dedicated to communication between other subsystems. This allows cutting the number of connections (interfaces) to only one per subsystem which will connect directly to the ESB. The ESB is capable of translating the interface into another interface. This allows cutting the costs of integration and provides extreme flexibility. With systems integrated using this method, it is possible to completely replace one subsystem with another subsystem which provides similar functionality but exports different interfaces, all this completely transparent for the rest of the subsystems. The only action required is to implement the new interface between the ESB and the new subsystem.&lt;ref name="Integ"/&gt;

The horizontal scheme can be misleading, however, if it is thought that the cost of intermediate data transformation or the cost of shifting responsibility over business logic can be avoided.&lt;ref name="Integ"/&gt;

A '''common data format''' is an integration method to avoid every adapter having to [[data conversion|convert data]] to/from every other applications' formats, [[Enterprise application integration]] (EAI) systems usually stipulate an application-independent (or common) data format. The EAI system usually provides a data transformation service as well to help convert between application-specific and common formats. This is done in two steps: the adapter converts information from the application's format to the bus's common format. Then, semantic transformations are applied on this (converting zip codes to city names, splitting/merging objects from one application into objects in the other applications, and so on).

'''Tadhkirat al-FuqahƒÅ''' (Memorandum for Jurists) is a book on Shiite jurisprudence written by Allameh [[Al-Hilli]]. The book is counted as one of the greatest reasonable books on [[Shiite]] jurisprudence.

==Introduction==
The book of Tadhkirat al-FuqahƒÅ counted as one of the greatest reasonably comparative books on Shiite jurisprudence or [[fiqh]]. The book is also referred to by other scholars as a confident reference. Allameh Hilli mainly points to opinions and ideas of Shaykh Tousi rather that of other Shiite Scholars.

==Motive==
The book has written by the request of Allameh [[Al-Hilli]]' s son namely Fakhr Al Muhaqeqin(Died.767 lunar)

==Style==
Allameh [[Al-Hilli]] says about his aim that he intent to express and explain the summaries of indult (Fatwa) of the jurist and rules of Scholars (Ulama) according to best explanation, the most correctness way, the most rightness style and the most confident methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilli|first=Hasan ibn Yousef| title= Tadhkirat al-Fuqah|publisher= Ale bayt|language=Arabic| place= Qom|date=1414 lunar|volume=1| page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The author divided the book into four rules such as: on prayings, on transactions, on unilateral obligation, on judgments. The book is divided to fifteen sections; some of them are as follow:
* The book of purity
* The books of Alms and fasting
* The book of safekeeping
* The book of buying either pecuniary or credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilli|first=Hasan ibn Yousef| title= Tadhkirat al-Fuqah|publisher= Ale bayt| language=Arabic|  place= Qom|date=1414 lunar|volume=1| pages=36‚Äì37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
The book has many characters. Some of them are as follows:
* Refer to consensus (Ijma) as Jomhourat Al Ulama or most of the religious scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilli|first=Hasan ibn Yousef|title=Tadhkirat al-Fuqah|publisher=Ale bayt|language=Arabic|date=1414 lunar|volume=1 &amp; 2|pages=64‚Äì115 &amp; 36‚Äì77}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Documentation through Imam's narrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilli|first=Hasan ibn Yousef|title=Tadhkirat al-Fuqah|publisher=Ale bayt|language=Arabic|date=1414 lunar|volume=1 &amp; 2|pages=71‚Äì85}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rejecting of juridical principles such as Istehsan and Qiyyas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilli|first=Hasan ibn Yousef|title= Tadhkirat al-Fuqah|publisher=Ale Bayt|language=Arabic|date=1414 lunar|volume=1 &amp; 2|pages=165‚Äì173 &amp; 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* using of public recourses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilli|first=Hasan ibn Yousef|title=Tadhkirat al-Fuqah|publisher=Ale bayt|language=Arabic|date=1414 lunar|volume=1|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summarize==
The book has summarized by Ibn Motawwej Bahrani, one of the great pupils of Allameh Hilli, in a book by the title of "Mokhtasar Al Tadhkrah".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Terani|first=Aqa Bozorg|title=Zariah Fi Tasanif Al Shiah|publisher=Dar Al Azwa|place=Beyrout|language=Arabic|date=1403|volume=4|page=422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
The book has published many times in [[Iraq]], [[Iran]]. The book until now published in twelve volumes. Also some part of Al Tadhkerah has published by Allameh Mozaffar and sayyed Mortaza Khalkhali in [[Najaf]].

== Calculation ==

=== Formulas ===
The TCRE is calculated based on a formula for the ratio of temperature change to cumulative carbon emissions (measured as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is the net carbon remaining in the atmosphere after accounting for relevant sources and sinks.&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2009" /&gt;  As a measure of atmospheric carbon change, the TCRE parameterizes [[climate sensitivity]] and carbon sensitivity to formulate a value that is the temperature change (¬∞C) per trillion tonnes of carbon emitted (Tt C).&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen et al, 2009" /&gt; This is represented via the following formula from Matthews et al., 2009:

&lt;math&gt;TCRE = \bigtriangleup T/E_T = (\bigtriangleup T/\bigtriangleup C_A)\times(\bigtriangleup C_A/E_T)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2009" /&gt;

where,
* ŒîT = average global temperature change (¬∞C)
* E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = cumulative carbon dioxide emissions (Tt C)
* ŒîC&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = change in atmospheric carbon (Tt C)
and, 1Tt C = 3.7 Tt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

TCRE can also be defined not in terms of temperature response to emitted carbon, but in terms of temperature response to the change in [[radiative forcing]] as in Myhre et al., 2015:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Myhre|first=Gunnar|last2=Boucher|first2=Olivier|last3=Br√©on|first3=Fran√ßois-Marie|last4=Forster|first4=Piers|last5=Shindell|first5=Drew|date=March 2015|title=Declining uncertainty in transient climate response as CO2 forcing dominates future climate change|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2371|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=8|issue=3|pages=181‚Äì185|doi=10.1038/ngeo2371|issn=1752-0908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;TCRE = \bigtriangleup T/ RF&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

where, 
* RF = radiative forcing (W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) taken at the top of the atmosphere (TOA)
Here TCRE is used to assess the assumed linear effect radiative forcing has on temperature change in an historical analysis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Modeling ===
TCRE is modeled using [[climate model]]s that simulate carbon emissions by increasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 1% per year from pre-industrial levels until the concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere is doubled (2 x CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or quadrupled (4 x CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Richard G.|last2=Goodwin|first2=Philip|last3=Roussenov|first3=Vassil M.|last4=Bopp|first4=Laurent|date=2016|title=A framework to understand the transient climate response to emissions|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/11/i=1/a=015003|journal=Environmental Research Letters|volume=11|issue=1|pages=015003|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/11/1/015003|issn=1748-9326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since these experiments all start from the same initial atmospheric concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (around 285 ppm&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;), the doubling and quadrupling occur at 70 and 140 years respectively. Different modelling parameterizations of TCRE include: holding CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions constant after quadrupling;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; modelling net negative emissions after doubling or quadrupling;&lt;ref name="Zickfeld et al, 2016" /&gt; stopping emissions after doubling and continuing the model for up to 10,000 years;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fr√∂licher|first=Thomas L.|last2=Paynter|first2=David J.|date=2015|title=Extending the relationship between global warming and cumulative carbon emissions to multi-millennial timescales|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/10/i=7/a=075002|journal=Environmental Research Letters|volume=10|issue=7|pages=075002|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/10/7/075002|issn=1748-9326}}&lt;/ref&gt; or running extended [[Representative Concentration Pathways|RCP]] scenarios and assessing temperature change per cumulative emissions at high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations.&lt;ref name="Tokarska et al, 2016" /&gt;

== Temperature Response ==

=== Global response ===
Global temperature change is approximately linearly proportional to cumulative carbon emissions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2018" /&gt; This means that for a given amount of carbon emissions, a related amount of [[global warming]] can reasonably be expected.&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frame|first=David J.|last2=Macey|first2=Adrian H.|last3=Allen|first3=Myles R.|date=2014-09-21|title=Cumulative emissions and climate policy|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ngeo2254|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=7|issue=10|pages=692‚Äì693|doi=10.1038/ngeo2254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Model data synthesized by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] from available studies suggests a ''likely'' TCRE of 0.8¬∞ to 2.5&amp;nbsp;¬∞C per Tt C (or 1000 Pg C).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a TCRE focus review, Matthews et al. (2018) estimate TCRE as 0.8¬∞ to 2.4&amp;nbsp;¬∞C per Tt C and suggest an observationally-constrained best estimate of 1.35&amp;nbsp;¬∞C per Tt C.&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2018" /&gt;

=== Regional response ===
Though the global average temperature response to cumulative emissions is approximately linear, this response is not uniform throughout the globe.&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leduc et al, 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Partanen|first=Antti-Ilari|last2=Leduc|first2=Martin|last3=Matthews|first3=H. Damon|date=2017|title=Seasonal climate change patterns due to cumulative CO 2 emissions|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/12/i=7/a=075002|journal=Environmental Research Letters|volume=12|issue=7|pages=075002|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/aa6eb0|issn=1748-9326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calculations by Leduc et al., (2016) of the geographical pattern of temperature response (the regional TCRE, or RTCRE) show values of low temperature change over equatorial and tropical ocean regions and high values of temperature change exceeding 4&amp;nbsp;¬∞C/Tt C in the Arctic.&lt;ref name="Leduc et al, 2016" /&gt; Likewise, they show a pronounced temperature response difference between the land and ocean, which is largely the result of ocean heat cycling.&lt;ref name="Leduc et al, 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bryan|first=K.|last2=Komro|first2=F.G.|last3=Manabe|first3=S.|last4=Spelman|first4=M.J.|date=January 1, 1982|title=Transient climate response to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide|url=|journal=Science|volume=215|pages=56‚Äì58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Regional precipitation response ====
Unlike the positive regional temperature response, regional precipitation change to cumulative emissions are positive or negative, depending on location.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Partanen et al., (2017) show a strong positive precipitation response in the Arctic with negative responses (meaning reduced precipitation) in parts of Southern Africa, Australia, North and South America.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Carbon Budget ==
{{main|Emissions budget}}

The observed and calculated linear TCRE and RTCRE leads to the notion of a carbon budget.&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Millar|first=Richard|last2=Allen|first2=Myles|last3=Rogelj|first3=Joeri|last4=Friedlingstein|first4=Pierre|date=2016-01-01|title=The cumulative carbon budget and its implications|url=https://academic.oup.com/oxrep/article/32/2/323/2433178|journal=Oxford Review of Economic Policy|volume=32|issue=2|pages=323‚Äì342|doi=10.1093/oxrep/grw009|issn=0266-903X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A carbon budget is the cumulative amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, emitted anthropologically as a globe, that leads to a set limit of global warming.&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The IPCC estimates the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-only carbon budget (with a 50% chance) for staying below 2&amp;nbsp;¬∞C at 1210 PgC (or 1.21 Tt C).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Accounting for the 515 PgC of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted between 1870 and 2011, this leaves a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-only carbon budget of 695 PgC, for a 50% chance of staying below a global average temperature change of 2&amp;nbsp;¬∞C.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Turkology''' (or '''Turcology''') is a complex of humanities sciences studying languages, history, literature, folklore, culture, and [[ethnology]] of people speaking [[Turkic languages]] and [[Turkic peoples]] in chronological and comparative context. This includes ethnic groups from the [[Sakha people|Sakha]] in East [[Siberia]] to the [[Balkan]] Turks and [[Gagauz people|Gagauz]] in [[Moldova]].

==History==
Ethnological information on Turkic tribes for the first time was systemized by the 11th-century Turkic philologist [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]] in the ''Dƒ´wƒÅn ul-Lughat it-Turk'' (Dictionary of Turkic language). Multi-lingual dictionaries were compiled from the late 13th century for the practical application of participants in international trade and political life: Kipchak (Cuman)-Persian-Latin-German  ''Codex Cumanicus'', ''Armenian-Kipchak'', and ''Russian-Kipchak'' dictionaries. By the Middle Ages the Turkology was centred around [[Byzantium|Byzantine]]/[[Greece|Greek]] historians, ambassadors and travelers, and geographers.  In the 15th-17th centuries the main subject of Turkology was the study of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Turkish language]], and the Turkic languages of [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Western Asia]]. In 1533 a first hand-written primer appeared, and by 1612 a printed grammar by Jerome Megizer was published, followed by [[Francisci a Mesgnien Meninski|F. Mesgnien-Meninski]]'s 4-volume ''Thesaurus Linguarum Orientalium'' published in 1680.

P. S. Pallas initiated a more scientific approach to Turkology with his ''Comparative dictionaries of all languages and dialects'' (1787) which included lexical materials from Tatar, Mishar, Nogai, Bashkir, and other T√ºrkic languages. In the 19th century, Turkology was further developed by M. A. Kazembek's ''Grammar of the Turkish-Tatar language'' (1839), O. N. Betlingk ''Grammar of the Yakut language'' (1851). A major achievement was the deciphering at the end of the 19th century of the Early Middle Age [[Old Turkic script|Orkhon]] inscriptions by [[V. Thomsen]] and [[W. W. Radloff]] (1895). By the end of the 19th century, Turkology developed into a complex discipline that included linguistics, history, ethnology, archeology, arts and literature. In the 20th century the Turkology complex included physical anthropology, numismatics, genetics, ancient Turkic alphabetic scripts, typology, genesis, and etymology, onomastics and toponymy. The appearance of ''T√ºrkische Bibliothek'' (1905‚Äì27) inaugurated specialised periodicals, followed by ''Mitteilungen zur Osmanischen Geschichte'' (1921‚Äì26). Scientific developments allowed calibrated dating, dendrochronology, metallurgy, chemistry, textile, and other specialized disciplines which contributed to the development of the Turkological studies. Deeper study of the ancient sources allowed better understanding of economical, social, mythological and cultural forces of the sedentary and nomadic societies. Linguistic studies uncovered pre-literate symbioses and mutual influences between different peoples.

===Persecution in Soviet Russia===

On 9 August 1944 the Central Committee VKP(b), the ruling party of the USSR, published an edict prohibiting "ancientization" of Turkic history. The edict was followed by a consecutive wave of mass arrests, imprisoning and killing of the [[intelligentsia]], massive creation of replacement "scientists", and re-writing of history pages on an industrial scale. Combined with the concurrent wholesale deportation of indigenous populations to remote areas in [[Middle Asia]] and [[Siberia]], the wipe-out of the science was nearly complete, and the impact of the action subsided only partially in the newly independent countries after the collapse of the USSR. In the two decades after the [[Bolshevik]]'s assuming power, the tradition of Turkological studies in Russia and dependent countries was practically [[Suppressed research in the Soviet Union|wiped out]].

On the other hand, this edict brought unintended benefits to Turkology. One was the nearly immediate linguistic development of an alternate lexicon which replaced the nouns and adjectives containing the word "T√ºrk" by a wealth of euphemisms: "nomads, Siberians, Paleosiberians, Middle Asians, Scythians, Altaians, Tuvians", etc. that filled scientific publications. The other was "writing into a drawer", when results of the years of fruitful work were written down for future publication. When the bonds relaxed, the publications exploded. Another was a flight of scientists from European Russia into remote areas, which brought first class scientists to many intellectually starved outlying areas of Middle Asia. Another one was connected with the statewide efforts to re-invent the history, when a wealth of Turkological facts were found in the process of search for "correct" history. And another one was a built-up of the public interest for the forbidden subjects, that resulted that no print size could satisfy the demand. [[Lev Gumilev|L.N.Gumilev]] and [[Olzhas Suleimenov|O.Suleimenov]] inflamed a surge in the new generation of Turkology scholars.

With the physical culling of the scholars from the society, concurrently was also organized a total extermination of all their published and unpublished works, their books were removed from the libraries and destroyed from private collections by intimidated population, articles and publications were culled, published photographs were retouched, private photographs were destroyed, published scientific references were erased, or publications with undesired references were destroyed. Very few of the early 20th century expedition diaries, ethnographical notes, reports and drafts for publications were ever recovered.

The '''University of Forestry''', ({{lang-bg|–õ–µ—Å–æ—Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏ —É–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç (–õ–¢–£)}}, often abbreviated as LTU), based in [[Sofia]], is a state [[university]] with 6 faculties with a total of 30 departments.

It is located in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria and is close to the Technical University and the University of Chemical Technology and Metallurgy. The University of Forestry has two Research Forests: the first one located near the village of Yundola in coniferous forest, and the other in the village of Barzia in deciduous forest. It also has a Training and Experimental Field Station in Vrazhdebna suburb of Sofia.

For more than 90 years now, the University of Forestry has been the only university in Bulgaria providing education in forestry, forest management, landscape architecture and wood processing. In the 1990s, the range of scientific fields was expanded to include ecology, agronomy, veterinary medicine and business management.

In mid 1990s, the University adopted the three-level degree system of bachelor, master and doctor degrees. At that time, it also introduced the European Credit Transfer System.

The motto of the University is ''Bulgarian traditions and European standards in education''. As an educational institution the University of Forestry strives to establish an academic environment in which values such as professionalism, freedom of speech and thought, humanism, collaboration and tolerance are encouraged.

==History==
In 1923, the Faculty of Agronomy at [[Sofia University]] (SU) established the Department of Silviculture, preparing the way for the Forestry Division at SU to which the University of Forestry traces its roots. Two years later, in 1925, the Forestry Division at SU was set up, and on 20 February 1925 the Academic Council of SU decided that the division should commence its educational activities by immediately enrolling the first 10 students of forestry.

In 1947, the Forestry Division of SU merged with the Forestry Division of Plovdiv University to establish the Faculty of Forestry at SU. This faculty was one of the four faculties that laid the foundations for setting up the Agricultural Academy in 1947. With Decree of the National Assembly of Bulgaria, dated 12 January 1953, the Agricultural Academy was restructured and three separate universities were established: Georgi Dimitrov Agricultural Academy, the Higher Veterinary Medicine Institute and the Higher Forestry Institute.

The Higher Forestry Institute was renamed the University of Forestry with Decree of the National Assembly of Bulgaria, dated 27 July 1995.

==Faculties==
The university has the following faculties:
* Faculty of [[Forestry]]
* Faculty of [[Forestry|Forest Industry]]
* Faculty of [[Ecology]] and [[Landscape Architecture]]
* Faculty of [[Agronomy]]
* Faculty of [[Veterinary Medicine]]
* Faculty of [[Business Management]]

The '''University of Michigan Institute for Social Research''' (ISR) is one of the largest academic [[social research]] and survey organization in the world, established in 1949. With an annual research budget of over $80 million, ISR includes more than 250 scientists from many academic disciplines ‚Äì including [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[demography]], [[history]], [[anthropology]], and [[statistics]]. It has been said to be "the premier center for survey research methodology in the world."&lt;ref name=Costello&gt;{{cite news |title=University of Michigan's Institute Shows What Makes Society Tick |first=Nancy |last=Costello |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-31/news/mn-51608_1_survey-research-center |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date= 31 October 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1946, the sociologist and economist [[Rensis Likert]] and six colleagues from his wartime work at the [[Bureau of Agricultural Economics]], including [[Angus Campbell (psychologist)|Angus Campbell]], [[Leslie Kish]], and [[George Katona]], formed the Survey Research Center (SRC) at the University of Michigan in order to apply the social survey techniques they had developed to broader issues facing post-war America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kish|first=Leslie|author-link=Leslie Kish|date=1990|title=A Choices Profile: Rensis Likert: Social Scientist and Entrepreneur|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/131305/2/Kish.pdf|journal=Choices: The Magazine of Food, Farm, and Resource Issues|publisher=Agricultural and Applied Economics Association|volume=5|issue=4|pages=36-38|via=AgEcon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RCGD"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcgd.isr.umich.edu/history/|title=Research Center for Group Dynamics: History|last=|first=|date=|website=Research Center for Group Dynamics, [[University of Michigan]]|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615163242/http://www.rcgd.isr.umich.edu/history/|archive-date=June 15, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, using techniques developed by Katona, the center began conducting surveys to compute the [[University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index|Consumer Sentiment Index]] that is one of the eleven components the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] includes in its [[Index of Leading Environmental Indicators]].&lt;ref name="Costello" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite speech|last=Curtin|first=Richard T.|title=Surveys of Consumers: Theory, Methods, and Interpretation|location=Washington, D.C.|event=[[National Association for Business Economics]] 44th Annual Meeting|date=September 30, 2002|url=https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/fetchdoc.php?docid=26396|access-date=2008-10-12|via=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The center gained visibility in its field due to a survey conducted in October 1948, when Campbell and [[Robert L. Kahn]] added two questions about political leanings to a survey they were conducting for the [[State Department]] about foreign policy. Their results, compiled just before the [[United States presidential election, 1948|presidential election]] in November, showed a large number of undecided voters and a small lead for [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] over [[Thomas E. Dewey|Thomas Dewey]], at odds with most other polls that predicted a landslide for Dewey. When Truman ended up winning the election, the subsequent examination of polling techniques led to the [[probability sampling]] utilized by the SRC becoming dominant in the field over the [[quota sampling]] that had been favored by other polling outfits.&lt;ref name="Rosegrant"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://isr.umich.edu/news-events/insights-newsletter/article/isr-and-the-truman-dewey-upset/|title=ISR and the Truman/Dewey upset|last=Rosegrant|first=Susan|date=April 18, 2012|editor=|website=|publisher=Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402213551/http://www.sampler.isr.umich.edu/2012/featured/isr-and-the-truman-dewey-upset/|archivedate=April 2, 2013|deadurl=|access-date=2018-10-12|df=|ref={{harvid|Rosegrant|2012}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; This survey was the first of what became the [[American National Election Studies]] (or NES). 

Psychologist [[Kurt Lewin]] had founded the Research Center for Group Dynamics at [[MIT]] in 1945, and after his death in 1947 the center's ensuing funding problems prompted its remaining members to find it a new home.&lt;ref name="RCGD" /&gt; The presence of the SRC and the university's support for social sciences led them to move to the University of Michigan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/dis/infoserv/literature/social-science-public-interest.pdf|title=Social Science in the Public Interest: A Fiftieth-Year History of the Institute for Social Research|last=Frantilla|first=Anne|publisher=Bentley Historical Library|year=1998|isbn=|location=Ann Arbor|pages=23|accessdate=2018-10-13}} Cartwright wrote that one of the most important reasons was "the strong emphasis placed upon social science and especially upon social psychology... The Survey Research Center brought to the campus a large group of social psychologists working on many research problems closely bordering upon the work of the Center... There can be no doubt that Ann Arbor in the coming years will be the scene of some of the most important developments in social science."&lt;/ref&gt; in 1948 under a new director, [[Dorwin Cartwright]]. The two groups united to form the Institute for Social Research on February 1, 1949.&lt;ref name="RCGD" /&gt; 

In 1962, [[Warren Miller (political scientist)|Warren Miller]], a [[Political Scientist|political scientist]], created the Inter-university Consortium for Political Research (now known as [[ICPSR]]) to help fund the maintenance and dissemination of the large data sets that the election studies and others were generating. Making such data sets available to all interested researchers was considered revolutionary at a time when the norm was for researchers to closely guard their data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/about/history/early-years.html|title=ICPSR: The Founding and Early Years|last=Austin|first=Erik W.|date=|website=University of Michigan|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SRC's Political Behavior Program, which had taken over direction of the election studies, became the Center for Political Studies in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Warren E.|date=April 1994|title=An organizational history of the intellectual origins of the American National Election Studies|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1475-6765.1994.tb00420.x|journal=European Journal of Political Research|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=247‚Äì265|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6765.1994.tb00420.x|issn=0304-4130|url-access=subscription|subscription=|via=Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Population Studies Center moved from the university's [[University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts|College of Literature, Science, and the Arts]] in 1998, bringing the total number of centers to five.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/about/|title=About - Michigan Population Studies Center (PSC)|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Michigan|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
The institute is an independent unit of the university, headed by a director who reports directly to the university's provost and executive vice president for academic affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spg.umich.edu/org-charts/510000|title=Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs|last=|first=|date=2017|website=Standard Practice Guides|publisher=University of Michigan|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615171119/http://spg.umich.edu/org-charts/510000|archive-date=2018-06-15|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises five separate but interdependent centers:
* Center for Political Studies (CPS): An [[interdisciplinary]] and collaborative [[social science]] research unit of international scope, this center analyzes individual [[political]] behavior and the role of institutions in contemporary society.
* Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR): The world's largest digital social science [[data archive]], this unit has nearly 700 member organizations from around the globe.
* Population Studies Center: One of the oldest [[population]] centers in the United States, the PSC works on [[United States|domestic]] and international demographic and population research.
* Research Center for Group Dynamics: The RCGD's research programs range from achievement, aggression, and culture and cognition to [[evolution]] and human adaptation.
* Survey Research Center: The SRC does interdisciplinary social science research involving the collection and analysis of data from scientific sample surveys.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4807">'''Vaginal photoplethysmography''' ('''VPG''', '''VPP''') is a [[photoplethysmogram|technique using light]] to measure the [[vasocongestion|amount of blood]] in the walls of the [[vagina]].  The device that is used is called a vaginal [[photometer]].

==Use==
The device is used to try to obtain an objective measure of a woman's [[sexual arousal]]. There is an overall poor correlation (r = 0.26) between women's self-reported levels of desire and their VPG readings.&lt;ref name=Chivers2010&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2010| title = Agreement of Self-Reported and Genital Measures of Sexual Arousal in Men and Women: A Meta-Analysis | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 39 | issue = 1| pages = 5‚Äì56 | pmc=2811244 | pmid=20049519 | doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9556-9 |vauthors=Chivers ML, Seto MC, Lalumi√®re ML, Laan E, Grimbos T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrument==
The instrument used in the procedure is called vaginal [[photometer]]. The device has a clear shell, inside of which is a light source and a [[photocell]], which senses reflected light.  The use of the device is done with the assumption that the more light that is scattered back, and that the photocell senses, the more blood is in the walls of the vagina.&lt;ref name=Jannsen2007/&gt; 

The output of the VPG can be filtered into two types of signals, which have different properties. The [[direct current]] signal is a measure of vaginal blood volume (VBV) and reflects the total blood volume in the [[vagina|vaginal tissues]].&lt;ref name="Hatch"&gt;Hatch, J. P. [‚ÄúVaginal photoplethysmography: Methodological considerations‚Äù],‚ÄùArchives of Sexual Behavior, 8, 357‚Äì374‚Äù, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; {{Update inline|date=February 2018}} The [[alternating current]] signal is a measure of vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) and reflects the pressure change within the [[blood vessel]]s of the vaginal wall associated with each heartbeat.&lt;ref name="Hatch" /&gt; While changes in VBV occur in response to sexual and anxiety-inducing stimuli, changes in VPA only occur in response to sexual stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Laan, E., Everaerd, W., &amp; Evers, A. [http://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/21166/21166.PDF?sequence=1 ‚ÄúAssessment of female sexual arousal: Response specificity and construct validity‚Äù], ‚ÄúPsychophysiology, 32, 476‚Äì485‚Äù, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=February 2018}} 
 
VPA is defined as the [[amplitude|peak-to-trough amplitude]] of the vaginal pulse wave. It is calculated by subtracting the means of all troughs from the means of all peaks experienced during stimulus presentation.VPA lacks an absolute scale of measurement; each unit of change (mV) does not correspond directly with a physiological change. Since VPA does not have a standard unit of measurement, it is difficult for researchers to make between-participant comparisons.&lt;ref name=Chivers2010/&gt;

==History==
VPG was first introduced in the 1960s by Palti and Berovici, who affixed a light source and photosensitive cell onto a [[speculum (medical)|gynecological speculum]] and recorded vaginal pulse waves.&lt;ref name=Jannsen2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jannsen|first1=Erick|last2=Prause|first2=Nicole|last3=Geer|first3=James H.|editor1-last=Cacioppo|editor1-first=John T.|editor2-last=Tassinary|editor2-first=Louis G.|editor3-last=Berntson|editor3-first=Gary|title=Handbook of Psychophysiology|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139461931|page=254|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_of_Psychophysiology.html?id=E7hRKwVBXb4C|language=en|chapter=Chapter 11: The Sexual Response}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Molenkamp&gt;{{cite web|last1=Molenkamp|first1=Bert|title=SexLab - Equipment &amp; Instruments - Vaginal Photoplethysmography|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~sexlab/ei-vp-uvaprobe.html|publisher=Indiana University|accessdate=10 February 2018|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palti, Y. &amp; Bercovici, B.

Tejera attended St. Mary's College in [[Southampton|Southampton, England]], a boarding school, from 1930-1938, receiving his Matriculate (university entry status certificate) in London in 1939. He received a fellowship to study at [[Columbia University]] in the U.S., completing his Bachelor of Arts degree at the undergraduate college in philosophy ([[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]]) in 1948 and his doctorate at the graduate school in philosophy in 1956 with a dissertation on "Philosophy and the Art of Poetry". He also completed his ''docente'' (teacher's training) at the Central University of Venezuela in 1951.
 
In his early career, Tejera held the following diplomatic posts:

*United Nations Secretariat, NY (Linguistic Consultant, 1946‚Äì49). He engaged in the first simultaneous translations from French and Spanish to English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:United_Nations_card_of_acknowledgement_.jpg|title=United Nations Certificate for Language Translation|last=Tejera|first=Victorino|date=1946|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served under UN Secretary [[Trygve Lie]] performing&amp;nbsp;simultaneous translations from French and Spanish into English.

== Intellectual influences and academic career ==

=== Years at Columbia ===
As a student at Columbia University, some of the principal teachers and direct influences on his work included the renowned intellectual and cultural historians [[John Herman Randall Jr.|John H. Randall Jr.]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Herman-Randall-Jr|title=John Herman Randall Jr.|last=Randall|first=John|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justus Buchler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justus_Buchler|title=Justus Buchler|last=Buchler|first=Justus|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Schneider (philosopher)|Herbert W.

His early philosophic passion was Greek Philosophy, and he received instruction in Classical Greek from [[Fred Householder]]. He studied History of Philosophy, Aesthetics, and Literary Theory. He also attended summer sessions in the late 1940's at the Kenyon School of English. He was profoundly affected by the writings of [[John Dewey]] and [[George Santayana]], as well as by the work and literature of the [[New Criticism|New Critics]] [[John Crowe Ransom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Crowe_Ransom|title=John Crowe Ransom|last=Ransom|first=John|date=|website=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ivor Winters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvor_Winters|title=Ivor Winters|last=Winters|first=Ivor|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   His art and literary interests in New York City enabled encounters with noted artists, writers, and poets of the beat generation such as [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Fritz Stern]], and artist [[Jacob Kainen]], with whom he formed an enduring friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/jacob-kainen-papers-9025|title=Papers of Jacob Kainen|last=Kainen|first=Jacob|date=|website=Smithsonian Archives of American Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was identified as the character 'Victor Villanueva' in Kerouac's ''[[On the Road]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beatbookcovers.com/kercomp/ontheroad.htm|title=Beat Book Covers "On the Road"|last=|first=|date=|website=Beat Book Covers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Latin American poet. Tejera published and translated poems as well.

A portrait of a gathering at Columbia mid-century with Tejera was printed in Fritz Stern's autobiography&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/08/books/chapters/1008-1st-ster.html|title=The Five Germanys I Have Known|last=Stern|first=Fritz|date=October 8, 2006|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the authors, and republished in the New York Times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/08/books/review/Reiss.t.html|title=Can It Happen Here?|last=Stern|first=Fritz|date=October 8, 2006|work=The New York Times Sunday Book Review|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic highlights ===
Above all, Tejera felt strongly influenced by Justus Buchler's metaphysics of literary art (metaphysics of human production) and the exhibitive nature of philosophy reflected in Buchler's ''Metaphysics of Natural Complexes''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metaphysics of Natural Complexes|last=Buchler|first=Justus|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1966|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Main of Light.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Main of Light|last=Buchler|first=Justus|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1974|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The influence of Buchler is one of the most apparent in Tejera's published works. Buchler was his dissertation adviser at Columbia when he wrote ''Philosophy and the Art of Poetry'' (1956),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/1941882|title=Philosophy and the Art of Poetry|last=Tejera|first=Victorino|publisher=Dissertation|year=1958|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tejera|first=V|date=December 1956|title=Doctoral Dissertations 1956|jstor=20123579|journal=Review of Metaphysics|volume= 10| issue = 2|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and longtime colleague and correspondent.

Tejera lectured in History at Georgetown University from 1951 to 1954, and then taught Philosophy at Rensselaer Polytechnic from 1956 to 1960, Farleigh Dickinson University 1960 to 1961, and Howard University from 1961 to 1966. Afterward he accepted a permanent position of Professor of Philosophy and Comparative Literature at the State University of New York (SUNY) campus at Stony Brook. He was conferred the title of Stony Brook University Professor of Humanities in 1991, and has since received the title of University Professor Emeritus (1996).

At Stony Brook, he taught Ancient Greek Philosophy, History of Philosophy, Aesthetics, Classical Political Philosophy, American Philosophy, Ancient Greek, Philosophy of History, and [[Plato]]'s Dialogues, in a teaching career spanning 40 years.

== Research and publications ==
Tejera's extensive and varied research in the Humanities culminated in books including:

* ''Modes of Greek Thought'' (1971),&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 
*''Rewriting the History of Ancient Greek Philosophy'' (1997),&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Randall Jr,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; this original work had become an important volume of Naturalist scholarship in America on the dramatic and dialogical reading of Plato. It helped groom a new generation of Plato students, and has redirected the traditional reading plan usually associated with Plato.

He added to the arts and human sciences with:

=== Contributions to Classic American philosophy ===
Tejera is the first American philosopher to apply Justus Buchler's modes of judgment to the study of history&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; and aesthetics. Along with Beth J. Singer, [[Thelma Z. Lavine]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and Horace S. Thayer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001/acref-9780199754663-e-962?rskey=J6gYfy&amp;result=6|title=Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers|last=Thayer|first=Horace S.|date=|website=Oxford Reference|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-06-20|title=Horace Standish Thayer|url=https://sk.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Horace_Standish_Thayer&amp;oldid=1025944|journal=Wikip√©dia|language=sk}}&lt;/ref&gt; he helped revive interest in classic American thought via the Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy (SAAP). He renewed interest in a John Dewey's philosophy of culture with an emphasis on poetics and rhetoric, Buchler's coordinative analysis, and philosophic historiography.

He contributed to the recovery of the [[Semiotics]] of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], especially its application to literary theory and philosophy ([[Semiotic literary criticism|Semiotics of Literature]]). Tejera's Semiotics books are a significant effort to mend the gap between scholars engaged in literary discourse and those who work in the social (or human) sciences and natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houser|first=Nathan|date=|title=Review of Literature, Criticism, and the Theory of Signs|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/houser/TEJERA.HTM|journal=Arisbe|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central theme of art and spirituality in American philosophy permeates his Semiotics books, ''American Modern: The Path Not Taken,'' as well as later works.

His later work in American philosophy had taken two paths: (1) a theory of creative rationality via the aesthetically-aware [[Metaphysical naturalism|metaphysical Naturalism]] of Justus Buchler and Peirce's semiotics, and (2) a fuller aesthetics and poetics-oriented theory in the human sciences and in interpretation theory ([[Hermeneutics]]). His latest book, ''Two Metaphysical Naturalisms,'' serves as a companion to ''American Modern,'' dwelling on some of the practical functions of American philosophical reflection. This alignment with classic American Philosophy also contrasts with the cognitivist aesthetics of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] which turns the aesthetic object into a cognitive object while failing to recognize its dimension of feeling, or the cognitive gain available in art as art in the fullest sense which both [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles S. Peirce]] and [[Justus Buchler]] defend.

== Plato's ''Dialogues'' and ''Rewriting the History of Ancient Greek Philosophy'' ==
Tejera's work in Plato studies emphasizes the nature of Plato's ''Dialogues'' as the dramatized conversational encounters and communicative interactions that their design shows them to be, as well as their character as literary works of art. He attends to the tone in which Plato's Socrates addresses his interlocutors to obtain satirical effects by persistent dialogical wit, humor and irony, often missed by readers. His published works on Plato establish that the dialogues are satirical of Spartan militarism and Pythagorean intellectuality, as well as of faction (reactionary dissent, partisanship, etc.) whether democratic or oligarchical. He has advanced this line of scholarship to counter the traditionalist reading of Plato with its predilection for ethical or political propositions, and supplanted it with the Columbia University School reading of the ''Dialogues'' through their literary construction and expressive speech.

Tejera offers the argument that nothing qualifies the works of Plato as expository tracts. Rather, they give every sign of being ''dialogical'' ''Dialogues''. That is, they are self-discovering works, highly orchestrated original queries''.'' Instead of supporting the dogma often labeled as "Platonic Idealism," Tejera follows internal clues and self-focusing devices in examining the formative prose of the ''Dialogues'' in line with the interpretational poetics developed in his literary theory volume (''Literature, Criticism, and the Theory of Signs'').

Tejera's most widely recognized book ''Plato's Dialogues: A Dialogical Interpretation'' (c. 1984, updated and revised 1999)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havelock|first=Eric|date=1990|title=Plato's Dialogues One by One: A Structural Analysis|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=intstudphil&amp;id=intstudphil_1990_0022_0001_0139_0140|journal=International Studies in Philosophy|volume= 22| issue = 1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; advanced the dramatic and dialogical reading of Plato which influenced and precipitated a generation of Plato studies (cf. Gerald A. Press  editions in Further reading below).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Columbia History of Western Philosophy|last=Popkin|first=Richard|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tejera invented and invoked a unique notation to address the confusion in Plato scholarship to address the Socratic problem in these and other papers, to disambiguate Plato's Socrates from the Historical Socrates, Xenophon's Socrates, and the various interpretations claimed to be Plato's own views. "To keep track of the many ''composite'' Socrates, both of "the tradition" and of individual commentators, we use the label SocC, "[[Socrates]] sub upper-case C." (cf. ''The Philosophy of Socrates Program Guide'' p.&amp;nbsp;106).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.hri.org/iagp/books/vol05.html|title="Dialogical Dynamics, Socrates, and Source-Criticism" from The Philosophy of Socrates, Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Greek Philosophy in Samos Greece 1990|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1991|isbn=|location=Athens, Greece|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tejera's notations for keeping track of Socrates ===
The conventions (subscripts) he used to note the ''kinds'' of Socrates that we are liable to encounter in discussions of Greek literature and philosophy include the following: 
* SocP - [[Plato]]'s Socrates - as a dramatic character in Plato's Dialogues. Plato's Socrates teases or is polite, refutes or rationalizes, is logical in argument or paralogical, tells stories to his interlocutors, allusively satirizes, or suspends judgment, and appears as seeking for definitions which he then cannot accept. Plato's Socrates was inductive, interrogative, skeptical, anti-dogmatic and in that sense anti-systematic. He is also a story-teller, poet-quoter, myth-maker, punster, ironic etymologizer, and intellectually scrupulous. SocP frequently quotes the poets he is misinterpreted as hating.
* SocH - Historical Socrates - as a questioner, or knowledge seeker, a critical non-conformist, a critical seeker after truth and competence. The Socrates who claimed to know only that he did not know is both SocH and SocP. We only know a small number of facts regarding SocH. We do not know enough about SocH to state that there was any such thing as a "circle of Socrates". 
* SocX - [[Xenophon]]'s Socrates - based on Xenophon's testimony in his works, that Socrates is a Spartanizer, chauvinist, conventional tutor of a militarist, but not a philosopher.
* SocHc - [[Cicero]]'s Socrates - based on Cicero's testimony, as in ''Academic''a ''I''. 
* SocC - Composite Socrates - the traditional Socrates that had been handed down by the Pythagorizing or Platonist tradition of Plato-interpretation. The conventional composite reading of Plato. Also, the view of Socratism (or Socraticism) associated with the composite view, often limited to the practice of interrogation and induction, or the theory of ideas as in [[Socratic Club|I.M. Crombie]] (Doctrines), [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J.N. Findlay]] (Unwritten Doctrines), et al.  
* SocC + (x) is the notation used to specify a Plato scholar. For more instances of this notation, we found SocCa for [[John P. Anton|Anton's Socrates]], and SocCr for Rossetti's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rossettiweb.it/livio/|title=Livio Rossetti|last=Rossetti|first=Livio|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates.  
* SocD - Doctrinal Socrates - Socrates derived from a literalistic reading, as a advancing a system of doctrine.  
* SocCn - [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s Socrates - Nietzsche's attitude to Socrates. Nietzsche had characterized Plato as a doctrinal system builder of the Idealist tradition. The aphoristic Nietzsche is anti-systematic, an anti-system builder in order to be free to question his own assumptions. Nietzsche both liked and disliked the undisambiguated SocC of the 'tradition'.   
* SocDn - Nietzsche's Socrates doctrinal subscript - 'Socrates' that is found to hold different doctrines by different expositors. The Socrates that Nietzsche disliked, a composite of traits derived from Diogenes Laertius and Xenophon, a composite both a culture hero ''and'' attached to some rationalist dogmas.  
* SocU - Socrates Undisambiguated - an unknown or uncritically formed Socrates. A Socrates to which fabulous predicates are attached, as in SocC. The undistributed Socrates of "the tradition". (An undistributed middle term), e.g., "Socrates was the first to discourse on the conduct of life". This label is for the complexly ambiguous, difficult to disambiguate (or not worth disambiguating) "Socrates" of much anti-dialogical writing about Socrates that fails to practice source-criticism. This "undistributed" Socrates, as in the fallacy of the undistributed middle term, because it is so often used as such. It sanctions the avoidance of distinction between SocP and SocH, or the other [[Socrates]]. 
* SocLy - Socrates in the ''Lysis'' - the fictional report by Socrates himself of a conversation he once held. These are sophistical traits that are incompatible traits with SocP. An un-Socratic Socrates, using un-Socratic language.
* SocL - [[Diogenes La√´rtius|Diogenes Laertius's]] Socrates - Socrates of the Biographical tradition, which is also historically unreliable. A view of Socrates via popular beliefs, and by beliefs, doctrines, as Laertius does. Socrates as a mishmash of contradictory attributes, but some traits coincide with traits of both SocP and SocX, all hearsay good or bad recorded about Socrates. 
* SocA - [[Aristophanes]] Socrates - the dramatic character in Aristophanes comedy ''[[The Clouds]]''.  
* SocAs - [[Leo Strauss|Strauss]]'s Aristophanean Socrates - an interpretive construction formed in response to "the ancient quarrel between poetry and philosophy", derived from a non-dialogical reading of Plato.   
* SocXs - Strauss's Xenophantean Socrates - A Socrates that is accepting of the views of Ischomachus in Xenophon. Strauss's Socrates that is in the main SocX with some traits of SocP super-added and derived from a literalist reading of both which reinforce doctrines of [[Laws (dialogue)|Plato's ''Laws'']] (''Laws'' is a "posthumous" work not by Plato himself. External and internal evidence point to it as an Academic production likely issued under the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] head of [[Platonic Academy|Plato's Academy]] [[Speusippus|Speusippos]] after Plato's death). Another notation, SocPs, Plato's Socrates according to Strauss.

Tejera is the first to utilize such conventions and standards of source-critical practices in the study of Greek Philosophy. It was the first substantial utility since the writing of [[Eric A. Havelock|Eric Havelock]] on the Socratic problem&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://orb.binghamton.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1083&amp;context=sagp|title=The Socratic Problem: Some Second Thoughts|last=Havelock|first=Eric|date=1979|website=Binghampton University Open Repository|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which modern scholars were plagued, and which had ended "in a dilemma of contradiction" (Havelock).&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havelock|first=Eric|date=1990|title=Plato's Dialogues One by One A Structural Analysis|url=|journal=International Studies in Philosophy|volume= 22| issue = 1|pages=139‚Äì140|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric A. Havelock|Eric Havelock]] had grouped the efforts of Plato interpretation scholars among the following 1) Sceptics, [[Olof Gigon]] and [[Anton-Hermann Chroust]], 2) Alternatives to the Sceptics, [[Gregory Vlastos]], [[Terence Irwin]], and Gerasimos X. Santas 3) and the Reconstructionists of Socraticism, [[Kenneth Dover|Kenneth J. Dover]] and [[W. K. C. Guthrie|W.K.C. Gutherie]]. This was ushered in by the earlier and now century old tradition of Plato interpretation via the [[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]] - [[Alfred Edward Taylor|A.E. Taylor]] thesis (my terminology, and first cited in an early article by Havelock&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havelock|first=Eric|date=1934|title=The Evidence for the Teaching of Socrates|url=https://monoskop.org/images/b/ba/Havelock_Eric_A_1934_The_Evidence_for_the_Teaching_of_Socrates.pdf|journal=Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association|volume=65|pages=287‚Äì292|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fifty Years (And Twelve) of Classical Scholarship|last=Ross|first=Sir David|publisher=Basil Blackwell - Oxford|year=1968|isbn=|location=Great Britain|pages=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which in effect had rendered Plato as a mere reporter of the doctrines of Socrates (Theory of Forms, Ideas), and with the middle dialogues together comprising all of the historical Socrates, SocH. These concerns are also addressed in the recent works of Charles H.

With the utility of Tejera's conventions, modern scholars have the advantage of addressing such dilemmas in a progressive and orderly fashion, whether from classicist, philosophical and historical orientations. A fuller examination and citations of these approaches may be found in the recent work of the philologist Holger Thesleff,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Thesleff|title=Holger Thesleff|last=Thesleff|first=Holger|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he notes Tejera's observations about the dogmatic interpretations of Plato, and the "Post-Platonic dogmatization of Platonism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies in Plato's Two-Level Model|last=Thesleff|first=Holger|publisher=The Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters|year=1999|isbn=|location=Helsinki, Finland|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tejera's Naturalistic view of Aristotle ===
Tejera's three books on [[Aristotle]] (''Return of the King''&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://rowman.com/ISBN/978-0-7618-0926-5|title=The Return of the King: The Intellectual Warfare Over Democratic Athens|last=Tejera|first=Victorino|publisher=Rowman Littlefield|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;'', Two Metaphysical Naturalisms''&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;'','' and ''Aristotle in Epitome''&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;) show how Aristotle was turned into a Platonizing logician by a long series of Alexandrian, Latin and Byzantine commentators, who in turn used Aristotle as a proper "introduction to Plato", a Plato that had been Pythagorized by the Academy (as an Academic reinterpretation of the dialogues) and initiated after his lifetime, in secondary literature. This long tradition of rendering Aristotle and misshaping of Plato is contested by Tejera as the dogmatic anti-dialogical and doxographical tradition of interpretation, and forms the basis of his inquiry into the pre-Scholastic Aristotle. These books help the reader to recover the Naturalist (nature-inquirer), and humanist Aristotle, lover of poetic drama.
