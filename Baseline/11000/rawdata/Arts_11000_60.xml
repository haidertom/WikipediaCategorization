'''''A Cure for Wellness''''' is a 2016&lt;!--PREMIERED IN 2016, DO NOT CHANGE--&gt; [[psychological horror]] film directed by [[Gore Verbinski]], written by [[Justin Haythe]], and starring [[Dane DeHaan]], [[Jason Isaacs]], and [[Mia Goth]]. Its plot follows a young executive who is sent to retrieve a colleague from a mysterious rehabilitation center in the [[Swiss Alps]].

An international co-production based in the United States, Germany, and Luxembourg,&lt;ref name=bfi&gt;{{cite web|work=[[British Film Institute]]|title=A Cure for Wellness (2017)|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/59ba52ef694c5|accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the film was shot on location at various German locations, including [[Hohenzollern Castle]] in [[Baden-Württemberg]]. Its screenplay, written by Haythe, is based on a story co-written by Haythe and Verbinski, who were both inspired by [[Thomas Mann]]'s 1924 novel ''[[The Magic Mountain]]''.

The film was released on February 17, 2017 by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film received mixed reviews and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing $26 million against its $40 million production budget.

==Plot==
At a large financial services firm in New York City, an executive named Lockhart is sent by the company board of directors to retrieve Roland Pembroke, the company's CEO who had abruptly decided to stay at a "wellness center" in the [[Swiss Alps]]. The board needs Pembroke to sign off on an upcoming merger. The company is being investigated for criminal misconduct, and several self-serving partners hope to place all of the blame squarely upon Pembroke. Lockhart arrives at the spa, but he is met with resistance by the staff and Dr. Heinreich Volmer in attempting to speak with Pembroke.

Lockhart leaves but is involved in a car accident and supposedly awakens three days later at the center with his leg in a plaster cast.  Curiously, in spite of the truly horrendous nature of the accident, both he and the driver suffer from no other injuries but a minor scratch or two. During his time at the spa, Lockhart meets a mysterious young girl named Hannah, who, among others, doses herself with a mysterious fluid kept in a small, cobalt-colored bottle.

A patient named Victoria Watkins, as well as residents of the nearby town, regale a fascinated Lockhart with the history of the spa. It was built on the ruins of a castle once owned by a baron roughly 200 years ago. The baron desired an heir of pure blood and married his sister. When the baron learned she was infertile, he began performing hellish experiments on the peasants to find a cure for her infertility. He succeeded, but after finding the carelessly buried bodies of his victims, the peasants stormed the castle and set it on fire. The baron's pregnant sister was captured by the peasants and the baby was cut from her womb before she was burned. Although the peasants tossed the baby into the local aquifer, it somehow survived.

Lockhart attempts to escape the center but finds that no one is allowed to leave. After gifting Hannah a ballerina figurine, Lockhart bikes into town with her help. Lockhart leaves Hannah in a bar and seeks out a translator for Pembroke's German-language medical dossier. He finds out that the people of the spa suffer from dehydration despite the quantities of water they imbibe from the aquifer.  Meanwhile, Hannah, who has been kept at the spa her entire life, explores the bar and attracts the attention of the locals.  Lockhart returns and gets into a fight with a man who was dancing with Hannah.  He is rescued by Dr. Volmer, who has discovered that Lockhart had left the spa with Hannah.  Everyone in the place is curiously cowed by Dr. Volmer.

Lockhart investigates his suspicions and discovers the transfusion wing of the spa is a front for macabre medical experiments. The water from the local aquifer possesses unique properties. It is very toxic to humans but has life restoring properties for the eels living in the water. The baron had devised a process to filter the water through the bodies of humans and distill it into a life giving essence.  Volmer uses the patients as filters for this process.

This "cure" is ingested by Hannah, Volmer, and his staff in order to gain vastly lengthened lifespans. Lockhart also realizes that his leg isn't broken and that he is being forcefully kept prisoner there. Volmer then subjects Lockhart to nightmarish treatments that warp his mind until he believes he is insane.  Hannah perceives this change and gives Lockhart back the ballerina figurine. This act helps to break him out of his delirium.

Around this time, Hannah has her first menstruation, and Volmer marries her. During the reception, he leads Hannah to a secret room built in the ruins of the castle and begins to sexually assault her. When Lockhart confronts Volmer he realizes that Volmer is the baron and Hannah is his daughter, the baby who was thrown into the well. They both had been aging very slowly due to the "cure". In the ensuing fight, Volmer's face is revealed to be a mask that hides his hideous burns. Lockhart sets Volmer and the castle on fire but is overpowered by Volmer all the same.

Hannah saves Lockhart by killing her father, who falls backwards into the aquifer and is eaten by the furiously voracious eels. Lockhart and Hannah escape from the premises on her bicycle as fire engulfs the structure. Not far down the road, Lockhart crashes into a car carrying his employers. They have arrived from New York to retrieve him and Pembroke. Lockhart tells his employers that Pembroke died. Lockhart is ordered into the car by the employers. Lockhart looks at Hannah and cannot abandon her. He chooses to ride away with Hannah, smiling as he finally escapes the asylum.

== Production ==
The screenplay for ''A Cure for Wellness'' was written by Justin Haythe, and based on a story conceived by Haythe and Verbinski, who were both inspired by the 1924 [[Thomas Mann]] novel ''[[The Magic Mountain]]''.&lt;ref name=han&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/a-cure-for-wellness-gore-verbinski-interview/|title=Interview: Gore Verbinski on Returning to Horror With "A Cure for Wellness"|date=December 21, 2016|last=Han|first=Angie|accessdate=March 2, 2017|quote=Gore Verbinski: Well, there’s this book by Thomas Mann called The Magic Mountain that we’re both fans of, and that book deals with people in a sanitarium in the Alps, clutching on to their sickness like a badge before the outbreak of World War I.

The castle was closed to the public for filming from July 13 to July 24, 2015. Aside from Hohenzollern, parts of the film were also shot in [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and Zella-Mehlis, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brenner|first1=Julia|date=June 25, 2015|title=Regisseur Gore Verbinski dreht Horrorfilm auf Burg Hohenzollern|url=http://www.schwarzwaelder-bote.de/inhalt.bisingen-regisseur-gore-verbinski-dreht-horrorfilm-auf-burg-hohenzollern.81413f01-c134-4051-b959-d1c3a4d881d1.html|website=''Schwarzwälder Bote''|language=German|accessdate=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An abandoned hospital in [[Beelitz#Beelitz-Heilstätten|Beelitz-Heilstätten]], Germany, served as a location for many of the hospital interiors.&lt;ref name=minton&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/a-cure-for-wellness-set-design-filming-locations|work=Architectural Digest|title=How A Cure for Wellness Marries Horror and Beauty in Set Design|first=Melissa|last=Minton|date=February 14, 2017|accessdate=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received funds of €8.1 million, from the German Federal Film Fund (DFFF), as well as €500,000 from [[Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dfff-ffa.de/index.php?pressemitteilungen&amp;newsdetail=20160120-52_staatsministerin-gruetters-dfff-bleibt-wichtiger-anreiz-fuer-einen-attraktiven-filmstandort-deutschland |title=DFFF Aktuell |language=German |trans-title=DFFF News |website=Deutscher Filmförderfonds |accessdate=April 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.medienboard.de/infothek/aktuelle-meldungen/aktuelles/News/detail/News/ministerpraesident-woidke-am-set-des-films-a-cure-for-wellness/ |title=Ministerpräsident Woidke am Set des Films "A Cure for Wellness" |language=German |trans-title=Minister-president Woidke at the set of "A Cure for Wellness" |website=medienboard.de|publisher=[[Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg]] |date=August 19, 2015|accessdate=April 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Wallfisch]] composed the score for the film, with music conductor [[Gavin Greenaway]] and performed by Chamber Orchestra of London in [[Abbey Road Studio]].

The water tank scenes took two weeks to film. DeHaan and the director communicated through an [[intercom]], and DeHaan wore a buoyancy and body-positioning waist harness connected with wires and an oxygen tank.&lt;ref name=Alexandertort&gt;{{cite web|author=Alexander, Bryan|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/02/16/dane-dehaan-a-cure-for-wellness-torture/97949662/|title=Why Dane DeHaan endured 'torture' for 'Cure for Wellness'|work=[[USA Today]] |date=February 16, 2017|accessdate=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The directors used a rubber drill in the scene where Dr. Brennan, the facility's dentist, drills through Mr. Lockhart's healthy tooth without anesthesia. According to DeHaan, he was genuinely nervous and his reaction was used in the filming. Verbinski stated that the scene had compositing, and DeHaan stated there was no outright CGI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Plante, Chris|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/20/14597944/cure-for-wellness-verbinski-dehaan-interview|title=The director of A Cure for Wellness on the unforgettable dental scene|website=[[The Verge]]|date=February 20, 2017|accessdate=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeHaan filmed the scene while wearing a [[dental gag]] and strapped to the chair.&lt;ref name=Alexandertort/&gt;

In the car crash scene, DeHaan was placed into a harness inside a device described by Bryan Alexander of ''[[USA Today]]'' as being similar to a [[rotisserie]] before being tossed around. DeHaan stated that he experienced his sole filming injury there, in which his arm was dislocated from and then relocated into the socket in its shoulder.&lt;ref name=Alexandertort/&gt;

The German actors used in the scene in which Lockhart is assaulted by elderly people had no prior experience in film acting. Alexander wrote that this scene "wasn't as torturous as it appears."&lt;ref name=Alexandertort/&gt;

==Promotion and release==
The film premiered at the [[Alamo Drafthouse Cinema]] in [[Austin, Texas]] on December 10, 2016, as part of the [[List of films shown at Butt-Numb-A-Thon#Butt-Numb-A-Thon 18 Psycho (2016)|Butt-Numb-A-Thon Film Festival]]. It subsequently received a theatrical release in the United States on February 17, 2017, by [[20th Century Fox]], after initially being slated for a September 23, 2016 release date.&lt;ref name=BOM/&gt;

In the United States, [[20th Century Fox]] premiered a 40-second [[Super Bowl commercials|exclusive commercial]] during the [[Super Bowl LI|51st Super Bowl]] on February 5, 2017, which resembled a medication advertisement.&lt;ref name=barrie&gt;{{cite web|work=Vulture|author=Barrie, Emma|title=A Cure for Wellness Super Bowl Spot Tricks You and Then Scares You|date=February 5, 2017|accessdate=March 16, 2018|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/02/a-cure-for-wellness-super-bowl-spot-is-terrifying.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]'' reviewed the television commercial, which noted: "This spot that aired during the Super Bowl tonight may have tricked you into thinking you were just watching a regular commercial for some terrible new medication, probably not approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]. But it turned out you were watching a trailer for a new supernatural horror film."&lt;ref name=barrie/&gt;

Two days before the film's U.S. premiere, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that 20th Century Fox had created a group of fake news sites as part of a viral marketing campaign for ''A Cure for Wellness''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/arts/fake-news-a-cure-for-wellness-movie.html|title=20th Century Fox Used Fake News to Publicize ‘A Cure for Wellness’|work=The New York Times|date=February 15, 2017|accessdate=February 22, 2017|first=Liam|last=Stack}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Klein, David O. |author2=Wueller, Joshua R.|ssrn=2958790|title=Fake News: A Legal Perspective|journal=Journal of Internet Law |volume=20 |issue=10 |pages=1, 6-13|date=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film trailer also gained media attention for showing a scene where Mia Goth was in a bathtub full of eels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Screen Rant|url=http://screenrant.com/cure-for-wellness-interview-mia-goth/|title=Mia Goth Explains Cure for Wellness' ‘Eels in the Tub’ Scene|accessdate=March 15, 2018|date=February 17, 2017|author=Putchko, Kristy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Indiewire|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/12/a-cure-for-wellness-trailer-mia-goth-dane-dehaan-gore-verbinski-1201757856|accessdate=March 17, 2018|title=‘A Cure for Wellness’ Trailer: Mia Goth Contends with a Bathtub Full of Snakes|author=Nordine, Michael|date=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Cure for Wellness'' grossed $8.1 million in the United States and Canada and $18.4 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $26.5 million, against a production budget of $40 million.&lt;ref name=BOM/&gt;

In the United States and Canada, the film was initially projected to gross $6–8 million from about 2,700 theaters in its opening weekend.&lt;ref name="preview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-movie-projector-great-wall-20170213-story.html |title=Matt Damon's 'Great Wall' poised for soft U.S. opening against 'Lego Batman' and 'Fifty Shades' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="preview2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/02/fifty-shades-darker-lego-batman-great-wall-cure-for-wellness-fist-fight-box-office-1201912117/ |title=Moviegoers Likely To Spend Less George Washingtons Over Presidents Day Weekend: Box Office Preview|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after making just $300,000 from Thursday night previews and $1.5 million on its first day, weekend projections were lowered to $4 million.

===Critical response===
''A Cure for Wellness'' received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its visuals, performances and ambition, but criticism for its length, plot and structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bumbray|first1=Chris|title=Review: A Cure for Wellness|url=http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/review-a-cure-for-wellness-243|website=JoBlo|publisher=JoBlo Media Inc.|accessdate=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheWrap/&gt; Critics have noted the film's [[Lovecraftian]] elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/a-cure-for-wellness-review-oh-god-not-the-eels/516738/|title='A Cure for Wellness' Is a Malevolent Thrill Ride, With Eels|first=David|last=Sims|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3418409/another-trailer-gore-verbinskis-a-cure-for-wellness/|title=The 'A Cure For Wellness' Trailer is a Lovecraftian Nightmare |work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=December 20, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[review aggregation]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 41% based on 182 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10.

A.O. Scott of ''[[The New York Times]]'' compared the film to works by [[Martin Scorsese]] and [[Guillermo Del Toro]], adding: "It’s all in good fun, really, though two and a half hours may be more of this kind of fun than a body can stand. You might feel like you’re in the company of a manic cinephile friend breathlessly recounting his favorite movie scenes in no particular order. You admire his devotion, his taste and his scholarship, but in the end the experience is probably more satisfying for him than it is for you."&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/movies/a-cure-for-wellness-review.html|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20180317093212/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/movies/a-cure-for-wellness-review.html|deadurl=no|date=February 16, 2017|accessdate=December 30, 2017|title=Review: ‘A Cure for Wellness’ Is a Riot of Film References.

''[[The New Republic]]''{{'}}s Josephine Livingstone criticized the film's conclusion: "The poor ending is a great shame. For Verbinski calls upon a great pantheon of stories in order to talk about daddy issues, yes, but more importantly to talk about capitalism. In the movie, two strains of moneymaking compete. Financial services go up against the wellness industry in a fully binaristic duel: city versus mountaintop, suit versus white coat, aggression versus docility. Both industries exploit those they profit from, and ''A Cure for Wellness'' is at its best when showing how contemporary philosophies of “health and wealth” are, at base, all the same old sin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New Republic]]|author=Livingstone, Josephine|accessdate=March 15, 2018|date=February 22, 2017|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/140807/cure-wellness-horror-movie-deserve|title=A Cure For Wellness Is the Horror Movie We Deserve}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moira Macdonald of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' was critical of the film's runtime, noting: "If Verbinski could have trimmed about an hour from the film (which weighs in at a portly 146 minutes), he might have had something... [it] looks terrific — clearly money was spent on production values, which is always a pleasant surprise in a non-franchise film...And the first half of the film nicely creates a squirmy, elegant tension."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Macdonald, Moira|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|title=‘Cure for Wellness’ review: Movie, heal thyself|date=February 14, 2017|accessdate=December 22, 2017|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/cure-for-wellness-review-movie-heal-thyself/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Holland of ''[[TV Guide]]'' awarded the film three out of five stars, writing: {{quote|''A Cure for Wellness'', Gore Verbinski’s eerie and atmospheric new horror film, looks like something supreme schlockmeister [[Roger Corman]] might have produced back in the day–if he’d been handed a boatload of cash and was given a green light to spend it on just one picture, that is. And that’s meant as a compliment: This movie is a demented riff on notable psychological thrillers like ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]'', and ''The Phantom of the Opera'', and it tosses in the most disturbing dental-work scene since [[Laurence Olivier]] did squirm-inducing things to [[Dustin Hoffman]] in ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]''.

Writing for ''[[TheWrap]]'', Alonso Duralde praised the film's production design but criticized its narrative, saying: "While the movie is about people who are happy to remain removed from the world, not realizing that they are involved in something truly dreadful, many viewers will be all too willing to head for the exits."&lt;ref name=TheWrap&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duralde|first1=Alonso|title=‘A Cure for Wellness’ Review: Sludgy Horror Film Mistakes Art Direction for Suspense|url=http://www.thewrap.com/a-cure-for-wellness-review-dane-dehaan-gore-verbinski/|website=The Wrap|accessdate=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Teenage Opera''''' is a musical project from the 1960s and was the creation of record producer [[Mark Wirtz]].

== History ==
According to Wirtz, he had been working on an idea for a [[rock opera]] since January 1966, when he was experimenting in his London studio and produced a piece of music entitled "A Touch of Velvet&amp;nbsp;– A Sting of Brass", under the name of "Mood Mosaic". Following a string of successful hits, he was asked to join [[EMI]] as an in-house record producer and he accepted, starting in January 1967.&lt;ref name=kollektionist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kollektionist.net/MarkwirtzTOstory/ |title=The Story Behind "The Teenage Opera" |publisher=The Kollektionist |accessdate=29 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121002031/http://www.kollektionist.net/MarkwirtzTOstory |archivedate=21 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://markwirtz0.tripod.com/markpwirtz/id15.html |title=Mark Wirtz&amp;nbsp;– Bio |accessdate=2008-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had already seen [[Pink Floyd]] start their career and he personally recommended them to be signed but thought the task of producing them would be better left to fellow producer [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman Smith]]. Wirtz decided to work with another band he had enjoyed, [[The In Crowd (British band)|The In Crowd]],&lt;ref name=Pally&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fufkin.com/columns/pally/pally_07_01.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030907133011/http://www.fufkin.com/columns/pally/pally_07_01.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 September 2003 |title=Fufkin.com: Robert Pally:  The Mark Wirtz Interview |accessdate=29 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who soon changed their name to Tomorrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevehowe.com/sh_bio1960.html |title=Biography&amp;nbsp;– Steve Howe Guitar Rondo |accessdate=2008-01-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107223308/http://www.stevehowe.com/sh_bio1960.html |archivedate=7 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wirtz, he dreamed up the idea of Grocer Jack soon after being contracted to EMI and in February 1967 shared the idea with his engineer Geoff Emerick, who agreed to work on it. They decided to call it ''Excerpt from A Teenage Opera'', to imply there was more to come and the recording was produced as part of the Mood Mosaic project.&lt;ref name=kollektionist /&gt; The basic concept of ''A Teenage Opera'' was a series of sketches featuring different characters who lived in a fantasy village. These stories were to be told by a young man to a young girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cherryred.co.uk/rpm/artists/markwirtz.htm |title=RPM Records :  Mark Wirtz |accessdate=2008-01-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104022218/http://www.cherryred.co.uk/rpm/artists/markwirtz.htm |archivedate=2008-01-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wirtz intended the final project to be animated and later compared it to the ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' by [[The Beatles]].&lt;ref name=Pally /&gt; Wirtz used members of ''Tomorrow'' to produce the first recording.&lt;ref name=LeonardsLair&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leonardslair.co.uk/teenage.htm |title=Various Artists&amp;nbsp;– A Teenage Opera&amp;nbsp;– The Original Soundtrack Recording |accessdate=2008-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
The first song written was the story of Grocer Jack, the local grocer who was taken for granted until he died.&lt;ref name=LeonardsLair /&gt; Wirtz took an unused backing track from an old recording of his, a song called "Love Will Always Find A Way" and [[Steve Howe (guitarist)|Steve Howe]] was asked to overdub the [[guitar]]. Wirtz had the character of Jack in his imagination but asked [[Keith West]] to write the lyrics for it. After West heard the music, he wrote the lyrics straightaway. Soon after, the single was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]]. The engineer, [[Geoff Emerick]], who was working with [[The Beatles]]' [[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]] album at the time, recorded the song in ''true stereo'', a rarity at the time, with all the latest technology that was available. The song itself featured the "Opera" trademark, the children's chorus, with singers from Corona Stage School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert |last=Webb |title=ROCK &amp; POP: STORY OF THE SONG `EXCERPT FROM A TEENAGE OPERA' Keith |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20050107/ai_n9693578 |publisher=[[The Independent]] |location=[[London]] |date=7 January 2005 |accessdate=2008-01-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502213332/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20050107/ai_n9693578 |archivedate=2008-05-02 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Single releases ===
[[Grocer Jack (Excerpt from A Teenage Opera)]] was released on 28 July 1967 and was an instant hit. It was played continuously throughout the summer, later known as the [[Summer of Love]] and was helped into its number 2 spot by being played on [[Pirate radio|pirate radio station]]s, particularly [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]] and [[Radio Caroline]].&lt;ref name=kollektionist /&gt; It was also featured on the very first broadcast of [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] on 30 September 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philbrodieband.com/muso-radio-one.htm |title=UK POP: BBC Radio 1's First Broadcast, BBC's First and Last TOTPS |accessdate=2008-01-18 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080127144101/http://philbrodieband.com/muso-radio-one.htm| archivedate= 27 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only kept off the number 1 spot by [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]]'s [[The Last Waltz (song)|The Last Waltz]] and the enormous success of Grocer Jack got the media's attention. Rumours began circulating about the rest of the project; according to one source, the entire project had been completed by September and there was talk of a musical starring [[Cliff Richard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David Lister |author2=Russell Newmark |title=Sixties 'Grocer Jack' rock opera gets off its back after 30-year wait |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960521/ai_n14039860 |publisher=[[The Independent]] |location=[[London]] |date=21 May 1996 |accessdate=2008-01-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502213327/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960521/ai_n14039860 |archivedate=2008-05-02 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another single was produced in October, "Sam," with West on vocals and Howe on guitar again. However, it did not get above 38 in the chart. Despite [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] [[disc jockey|DJ]] [[Tony Blackburn]] helping promote it and Wirtz creating a special edited airplay version, the song was a failure, as it simply did not have nearly as much publicity as Grocer Jack did and was played a lot less. The fact many of the pirate stations had been shut down did not help things either. Following this, West made the decision to leave the project. He found it difficult to work between two very different projects and it confused fans.&lt;ref name=kollektionist /&gt; Wirtz meanwhile completed ''(He's Our Dear Old) Weatherman'', which had started out as ''The Paranoiac Woodcutter''. It was the most complex recording so far, containing more than 100 different sounds. However, like "Sam", it received very little airplay, due to Radio 1's seeming inability to play it.{{clarify|date=September 2016}} Wirtz had already begun working on Tomorrow's album and recorded a remake of ''Hallucinations'' for single release. It was renamed to "Mr Rainbow". Wirtz produced this song, sung by Steve Flynn in August 1967. Wirtz took another track from the album, ''Shy Boy'' and it was re-recorded by [[Kippington Lodge]]. These two songs eventually ended up on the final album released in 1996.

''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' asserted in April 2004 that "Sam" was a major influence on [[Pete Townshend]]'s ''[[Tommy (album)|Tommy]]''.

=== Other recordings ===
Wirtz composed a range of material around this time, releasing it under a series of pseudonyms. Much of the music produced in late 1967 became part of the project and was released on the 1996 album. There were two particular recordings that did not survive, "The Sad Story Of Simon And His Bugle" and "Two's Company, Three Thousand's A Crowd". The latter was a musical comedy, with the voices of [[Tim Rice]] and [[Samantha Jones (singer)|Samantha Jones]]. In January 1968 Wirtz married [[Ross Hannaman]] and subsequently recorded many songs co-written with her. The track "Barefoot and Tiptoe" was one of their collaborations and featured her voice, as well as the Band of the Irish Guards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://mog.com/music/Mark_Wirtz/biography| title= Mark Wirtz Biography| accessdate= 2008-05-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080502194856/http://mog.com/music/Mark_Wirtz/biography| archivedate= 2008-05-02| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released as by ''The Sweetshop'' but sales were poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://relayer35.com/Yescography/ATeenageOpera.htm |title=A Teenage Opera |accessdate=2008-05-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080502202825/http://relayer35.com/Yescography/ATeenageOpera.htm| archivedate= 2 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wirtz was forced to shelve the project and concentrated on ''Tomorrow'', whose album was released in February 1968. However, many songs were released over the years that were intended for the project, for example ''Dream Dream Dream'', performed by Wirtz but credited as Zion De Gallier. An album released in [[Germany]] in 1968 contained what was the basis for the ''Theme from a Teenage Opera''.

Grocer Jack was parodied in the mid 1970s on a [[flexi-disk]] ([[Private Eye recordings]]) released by the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]''. The words were changed to "Grocer Heath, Grocer Heath, cover up those awful teeth", referring to the [[Prime Minister]], [[Edward Heath]].

== Tracks ==
In 1996 a CD was released by Wirtz with every track recorded over the years intended for use in ''A Teenage Opera''. Some of the songs (notably the two singles) were remixed in stereo.

'''Androgyny ''' is the combination of [[masculine]] and [[feminine]] characteristics. Usually used to describe characters or people who have no specific gender, gender ambiguity may also be found in [[fashion]], [[gender identity]], [[sexual identity]], or [[sexual lifestyle]].

In the case of gender identity, terms such as [[genderqueer]], or [[gender neutral]] are more commonly used.

==Etymology==
Androgyny as a noun came into use {{circa|1850}}, [[nominalization|nominalizing]] the adjective ''androgynous''.  The adjective use dates from the early 17th century and is itself derived from the older French (14th Century) and English ({{circa|1550}}) term ''androgyne''. The terms are ultimately derived from {{lang-grc|[[wikt:ἀνδρόγυνος|ἀνδρόγυνος]]}}, from {{lang|el|ἀνήρ}}, [[Word stem|stem]] {{lang|el|ἀνδρ}}- (''anér, andr-'', meaning man) and {{lang|el|γυνή}} (''gunē, gyné'', meaning woman) through the {{lang-lat|[[wikt:androgynus|androgynus]]}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=androgynous&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary: ''androgynous'' |accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The older word form ''androgyne'' is still in use as a noun with an overlapping set of meanings.

==History==
Androgyny among humans – physical, psychological, and cultural – is attested to from earliest history and across world cultures. In ancient [[Sumer]], androgynous and [[hermaphroditism|hermaphroditic]] men were heavily involved in the cult of Inanna.&lt;ref name="Leick"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leick|first=Gwendolyn|title=Sex and Eroticism in Mesopotamian Literature|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1-134-92074-7|location=New York City, New York|pages=|quote=|via=|origyear=1994|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WKoWblE4pd0C&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|157–158}} A set of priests known as ''[[gala (priests)|gala]]'' worked in Inanna's temples, where they performed elegies and lamentations.&lt;ref name="Leick"/&gt;{{rp|285}} ''Gala'' took female names, spoke in the ''[[Sumerian language#Dialects|eme-sal]]'' dialect, which was traditionally reserved for women, and appear to have engaged in [[Gay sexual practices|homosexual intercourse]].&lt;ref name="Roscoe"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roscoe|first1=Will|last2=Murray|first2=Stephen O.|date=1997|title=Islamic Homosexualities: Culture, History, and Literature|location=New York City, New York|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=0-8147-7467-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6Zw-AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;q=Gordon%201959%20gala|pages=65–66|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later [[Mesopotamia]]n cultures, ''kurgarrū'' and ''assinnu'' were servants of the goddess [[Ishtar]] (Inanna's [[East Semitic]] equivalent), who [[cross-dressing|dressed in female clothing]] and performed war dances in Ishtar's temples.&lt;ref name="Roscoe"/&gt; Several Akkadian [[proverb]]s seem to suggest that they may have also engaged in homosexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Roscoe"/&gt; Gwendolyn Leick, an anthropologist known for her writings on Mesopotamia, has compared these individuals to the contemporary Indian ''[[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]''.&lt;ref name="Leick"/&gt;{{rp|158–163}} In one Akkadian hymn, Ishtar is described as transforming men into women.&lt;ref name="Roscoe"/&gt;

The ancient Greek myth of [[Hermaphroditus]] and [[Salmacis]], two divinities who fused into a single immortal – provided a frame of reference used in Western culture for centuries. Androgyny and homosexuality are seen in Plato's Symposium in a myth that Aristophanes tells the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Symposium: and, The Phaedrus; Plato's erotic dialogues|year=1993|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0-7914-1617-4|others=Translated and with introduction and commentaries by William S. Cobb}}&lt;/ref&gt; People used to be spherical creatures, with two bodies attached back to back who cartwheeled around. There were three sexes: the male-male people who descended from the sun, the female-female people who descended from the earth, and the male-female people who came from the moon. This last pairing represented the androgynous couple. These sphere people tried to take over the gods and failed. Zeus then decided to cut them in half and had Apollo repair the resulting cut surfaces, leaving the navel as a reminder to not defy the gods again. If they did, he would cleave them in two again to hop around on one leg. Plato states in this work that homosexuality is not shameful. This is one of the earlier written references to androgyny. Other early references to androgyny include astronomy, where androgyn was a name given to planets that were sometimes warm and sometimes cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0000.198 | title=Androgyn |publisher=University of Michigan Library | accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers such as [[Philo of Alexandria]], and early Christian leaders such as [[Origen]] and [[Gregory of Nyssa]], continued to promote the idea of androgyny as humans' original and perfect state during [[late antiquity]].”&lt;ref name="Lugt, Maaike 2010"&gt;van der Lugt, Maaike, “Sex Difference in Medieval Theology and Canon Law,” ''Medieval Feminist Forum (University of Iowa)'' vol. 46 no. 1 (2010): 101–121&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], the concept of androgyny played an important role in both Christian [[Theology|theological]] debate and [[Alchemy|Alchemical]] theory. Influential Theologians such as [[John of Damascus]] and [[John Scotus Eriugena]] continued to promote the pre-fall androgyny proposed by the early [[Church Fathers]], while other clergy expounded and debated the proper view and treatment of contemporary “hermaphrodites.”&lt;ref name="Lugt, Maaike 2010"/&gt;

[[Western esotericism]]’s embrace of androgyny continued into the [[Modern history|modern period]].  A 1550 anthology of Alchemical thought, ''[[De Alchemia]]'', included the influential [[Rosary of the Philosophers]], which depicts the sacred marriage of the masculine principle (Sol) with the feminine principle (Luna) producing the “Divine Androgyne,” a representation of Alchemical [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] beliefs in dualism, transformation, and the transcendental perfection of the union of opposites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/176917711|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Alchemy|last=Hauck|first=Dennis William|date=2008|publisher=Alpha Books|year=|isbn=9781592577354|location=New York|pages=|oclc=176917711}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The symbolism and meaning of androgyny was a central preoccupation of the [[German mystic]] [[Jakob Böhme]] and the Swedish philosopher [[Emanuel Swedenborg]].  The philosophical concept of the “Universal Androgyne” (or “Universal Hermaphrodite”) – a perfect merging of the sexes that predated the current corrupted world and/or was the utopia of the next – also plays a central role in [[Rosicrucian]] doctrine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/792888485|title=The Secret Doctrine of the Rosicrucians|last=Atkinson|first=William Walker|date=2012|publisher=Weiser Books|others=|year=|isbn=9781578635344|editor-last=Marsh|editor-first=Clint|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=52–61|oclc=792888485}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rose-croix.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rosicrucian_prophecies.pdf#page=4|title=Rosicrucian Prophecies|last=Rosicrucian Order|first=AMORC|date=13 December 2011|website=rose-croix.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in philosophical traditions such as [[The New Church (Swedenborgian)|Swedenborgianism]] and [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]].  Twentieth century architect [[Claude Fayette Bragdon]] expressed the concept mathematically as a [[magic square]], using it as building block in many of his [[First Universalist Church (Rochester, New York)|most noted buildings]].&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Eugenia Victoria (June 2004). “Geomantic Mathematical (re)Creation: Magic Squares and Claude Bragdon's Theosophic Architecture”.

===Fashion history===
Throughout most of twentieth century Western history, social rules have restricted people's dress according to gender. Trousers were traditionally a male form of dress, frowned upon for women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Twentieth Century Fashion|last=Ewing|first=E.|last2=Mackrell|first2=A.|publisher=Quite Specific Media Group Ltd|year=2002|isbn=|location=LA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the 1800s, female spies were introduced and [[Vivandière]]s wore a certain uniform with a dress over trousers. Women activists during that time would also decide to wear trousers, for example [[Luisa Capetillo]], a women's rights activist and the first woman in Puerto Rico to wear trousers in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Luisa Capetillo, Pioneer Puerto Rican Feminist: With the collaboration of students from the Graduate Program in Translation, The University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras, Spring 1991|last=Valle-Ferrer|first=Norma|date=1 June 2006|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing Inc.|isbn=9780820442853|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Gabrielle Chanel en marinière.jpg|thumb|[[Coco Chanel]] wearing a sailor's jersey and trousers. 1928]]
In the 1900s, starting around World War I traditional gender roles blurred and fashion pioneers such as [[Paul Poiret]] and [[Coco Chanel]] introduced trousers to women's fashion. The "flapper style" for women of this era included trousers and a chic bob, which gave women an androgynous look.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qfl0AQAAQBAJ|title=A Social History of Late Ottoman Women: New Perspectives|last=Köksal|first=Duygu|last2=Falierou|first2=Anastasia|date=10 October 2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004255258|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coco Chanel, who had a love for wearing trousers herself, created trouser designs for women such as beach pajamas and horse-riding attire.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the 1930s, glamorous actresses such as [[Marlene Dietrich]] fascinated and shocked many with their strong desire to wear trousers and adopt the androgynous style. Dietrich is remembered as one of the first actresses to wear trousers in a premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barnebys.co.uk/blog/article/1293/|title=Harriet Fisher|website=The Queen of Androgyny – Marlene Dietrich – Blog|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yves St Laurent le smoking at deYoung Museum San Francisco.jpg|left|thumb|240x240px|Yves Saint Laurent, the Le Smoking tuxedo suit, created in 1966]]

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the [[women's liberation movement]], sexual liberation and the [[Stonewall riots]] that were happening at that time are likely to have contributed to ideas and influenced fashion designers, such as [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/21/opinions/kohn-seventies-sexual-revolution/index.html|title=The Seventies: The sex freakout|last=Commentator|first=Sally Kohn, CNN Political|website=CNN|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yves Saint Laurent designed the Le Smoking suit and first introduced in 1966, and [[Helmut Newton]]’s erotized androgynous photographs of it made [[Le Smoking]] iconic and classic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sophmoet.wordpress.com/2014/05/01/352mc-27/|title=Androgyny and Feminism|last=Moet|first=Sophie|date=1 May 2014|website=Sophie Moet|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Le Smoking|Le Smoking tuxedo]] was a controversial statement of femininity and has revolutionized trousers.

However, the upsurge of androgynous dressing for men really began after during the 1960s and 1970s. When the Rolling Stones played London's Hyde Park in 1969, [[Mick Jagger]] wore a white 'man's dress' designed by British designer Mr Fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150331-womens-clothes-for-men|title=His or hers: Will androgynous fashion catch on?|last=Baker|first=Lindsay|website=www.bbc.com|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Fish, also known as [[Michael Fish (fashion designer)|Michael Fish]], was the most fashionable shirt-maker in London, the inventor of '[[Kipper tie|the Kipper tie]]', and a principal taste-maker of 'the Peacock revolution' in men's fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elan|first1=Priya|title=Peacock revolution back with label that dressed Mick Jagger and David Bowie|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/13/peacock-revolution-david-bowie-mick-jagger-mr-fish|work=The Guardian|date=13 March 2016|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; His creation for Mick Jagger was considered to be the epitome of the swinging 60s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/10129974/Mick-Jaggers-white-dress-cast-him-as-a-romantic-hero.html|title=Mick Jagger's white dress cast him as a romantic hero|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, the androgynous style was being adopted by many celebrities.

[[File:Eurythmics 06101986 02 270.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Annie Lennox]] was known for her androgyny in the 1980s]]
During the 1970s, [[Jimi Hendrix]] was wearing [[high heels]] and blouses quite often, and [[David Bowie]] presented his alter ego [[Ziggy stardust (persona)|Ziggy Stardust]], a character that was a symbol of sexual ambiguity when he launched the album 'The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and Spiders from Mars'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wsimag.com/fashion/91-androgyny-in-the-fashion-world|title=Androgyny in the fashion world|last=Lalovic|first=Itana|date=19 November 2013|website=Wall Street International|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was when androgyny entered the mainstream in the 1970s and had a big influence in pop culture. Another significant influence during this time included [[John Travolta]], one of the androgynous male heroes of the post-counter-culture disco era in the 1970s, who starred in ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' and ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDdtBc2LjKQC|title=Extra-Ordinary Men: White Heterosexual Masculinity and Contemporary Popular Cinema|last=Rehling|first=Nicola|date=21 June 2010|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9781461633426|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing into the 1980s, the rise of avant-garde fashion designers like [[Yohji Yamamoto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Global Influences: Challenging Western Traditions|journal=London: Berg|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenged the social constructs around gender. They reinvigorated androgyny in fashion, addressing gender issues. This was also reflected within pop culture icons during the 1980s, such as [[David Bowie]] and [[Annie Lennox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author =Andrew Anthony|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/10/annie-lennox-eurythmics-christmas-cornucopia-universal-child|title=Annie Lennox: the interview|work=The Observer|accessdate=2 October 2012|location=London, UK|date=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Power dressing]] for women became even more prominent within the 1980s which was previously only something done by men in order to look structured and powerful. However, during the 1980s this began to take a turn as women were entering jobs with equal roles to the men. In the article “The Menswear Phenomenon” by Kathleen Beckett written for Vogue in 1984 the concept of power dressing is explored as women entered these jobs they had no choice but to tailor their wardrobes accordingly, eventually leading the ascension of power dressing as a popular style for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Menswear Phenomenon.|journal=Vogue; Conde Nast|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women begin to find through fashion they can incite men to pay more attention to the seduction of their mental prowess rather, than the physical attraction of their appearance. This influence in the fashion world quickly makes its way to the world of film, with movies like "Working Girl" using power dressing women as their main subject matter.

Androgynous fashion made its most powerful in the 1980s debut through the work of Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo, who brought in a distinct Japanese style that adopted distinctively gender ambiguous theme. These two designers consider themselves to very much a part of the avant-garde, reinvigorating Japanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Global Influences: Challenging Western Traditions.|journal=London: Berg.|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a more anti-fashion approach and deconstructing garments, in order to move away from the more mundane aspects of current Western fashion. This would end up leading a change in Western fashion in the 1980s that would lead on for more gender friendly garment construction. This is because designers like Yamamoto believe that the idea of androgyny should be celebrated, as it is an unbiased way for an individual to identify with one's self and that fashion is purely a catalyst for this.

Also during the 1980s, [[Grace Jones]]'s a famous singer and fashion model gender-thwarted appearance in the 1980s which startled the public, but her androgynous style of heavily derivative of power dressing and eccentric personality has inspired many, and has become an androgynous style icon for modern celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highsnobiety.com/2015/05/14/androgynous-fashion-moments/|title=Androgynous Fashion Moments|date=14 May 2015|website=Highsnobiety|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was seen as controversial but from then on, there was a rise of unisex designers later in the 1990s and the androgynous style was widely adopted by many.

In 2016, [[Louis Vuitton]] revealed that [[Jaden Smith]] would star in their womenswear campaign. Because of events like this, [[gender fluidity]] in fashion is being vigorously discussed in the media, with the concept being articulated by [[Lady Gaga]], [[Ruby Rose]], and in [[Tom Hooper]]'s film ''[[The Danish Girl (film)|The Danish Girl]]''. Jaden Smith and other young individuals, such as [[Lily-Rose Depp]], have inspired the movement with his appeal for clothes to be non-gender specific, meaning that men can wear skirts and women can wear boxer shorts if they so wish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cubmagazine.co.uk/2016/02/gender-fluidity-in-the-fashion-industry/ |title=Gender Fluidity in the Fashion Industry|date=8 February 2016|website=Cub Magazine|access-date=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols and iconography==

[[File:Chambers 1908 Caduceus.png|thumb|The Caduceus]]
In the ancient and medieval worlds, androgyny and hermaphrodites were represented in art by the [[caduceus]], a wand of transformative power in ancient Greco-Roman mythology.  The caduceus was created by [[Tiresias]] and represents his transformation into a woman by [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] in punishment for striking at mating snakes. The caduceus was later carried by [[Hermes]]/[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and was the basis for the [[astronomical symbol]] for the [[planet]] [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and the botanical sign for hermaphrodite.  That sign is now sometimes used for [[transgender]] people.

Another common androgyny icon in the medieval and early modern period was the [[Rebis]], a [[conjoined]] male and female figure, often with solar and lunar motifs.  Still another symbol was what is today called [[sun cross]], which united the cross (or [[saltire]]) symbol for male with the circle for female.&lt;ref&gt;William Wallace Atkinson, The Secret Doctrines of the Rosicrucians (London: L.N. Fowler &amp; Co., 1918), 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt;  This sign is now the astronomical symbol for the planet [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/galleries/solar-system-symbols|accessed {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814172945/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/galleries/solar-system-symbols%7Caccessed |date=14 August 2016 }} 23 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender identity==
An androgyne is a person who does not fit neatly into the typical [[masculinity|masculine]] and [[femininity|feminine]] [[gender roles]] of their society. Androgynes may also use the term "ambigender" or  "[[Genderqueer|polygender]]" to describe themselves. Many androgynes identify as being mentally between woman and man. They may identify as "non-gender", "gender-neutral", "agender", "between genders", "[[genderqueer]]", "non-binary", "multigender", "intergendered", "pangender" or "gender fluid".&lt;ref name="Definition"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://androgynous.askdefine.com/ |title=Definition of androgynous: Dictionary and Thesaurus |accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who is androgynous may engage freely in what is seen as masculine or feminine behaviors as well as tasks. They have a balanced identity that includes the virtues of both men and women and may disassociate the task with what gender it may be socially or physically assigned to.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; People who are androgynous disregard what traits are culturally constructed specifically for males and females within a specific society, and rather focus on what behavior is most effective within the situational circumstance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = DESIRABLE AND UNDESIRABLE ANDROGYNY: A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY|last = Woodhill|first = Brenda|date = 2004|journal = Journal of Gender Studies|doi = |pmid = |first2 = Curtis|last2 = Samuels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bem Sex-Role Inventory==
The [[Bem Sex-Role Inventory]] (BSRI) was constructed by the early leading proponent of androgyny, [[Sandra Bem]] (1977).&lt;ref name="Santrock"&gt;Santrock, J. W. (2008). ''A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development''.&lt;!--Perhaps the year is wrong (2007 or 2009) or the title is wrong (Life-Span Development).--&gt; New York, NY: The McGraw-Hill Companies. 007760637X&lt;/ref&gt;  The BSRI is one of the most widely used gender measures. Based on an individual's responses to the items in the BSRI, they are classified as having one of four gender role orientations: masculine, feminine, androgynous, or undifferentiated. Bem understood that both masculine and feminine characteristics could be expressed by anyone and it would determine those gender role orientations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender in Communication|last = DeFrancisco|first = Victoria L.|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-4522-2009-3|location = |pages = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An androgynous person is a female or male who has a high degree of both feminine (expressive) and masculine (instrumental) traits. A feminine individual is ranked high on feminine (expressive) traits and ranked low on masculine (instrumental) traits. A masculine individual is ranked high on instrumental traits and ranked low on expressive traits. An undifferentiated person is low on both feminine and masculine traits.&lt;ref name="Santrock" /&gt;

==Gender and behavior==
[[Lesbian]]s who do not define themselves as [[Butch and femme|butch or femme]] may identify with various other labels including "androgynous" or "andro" for short. A few other examples include "[[tomboy]]" and "tom suay", which is [[Thai language|Thai]] for 'beautiful butch'. Some lesbians reject [[gender performativity]] labels altogether and resent their imposition by others. Note that androgynous and butch are often considered equivalent definitions, though less so in the butch/femme scene.

The recently coined word ''[[genderqueer]]'' is often used to refer to androgyny, but the terms "genderqueer" and "androgyny" (or "androgynous") are neither equivalent nor interchangeable.{{Citation needed|reason=entire paragraph is unsubstantiated and unclear.|date=July 2016}} "Genderqueer" is not specific to androgynes. It does not denote gender identity and may refer to any person, [[cisgender]] or [[transgender]], whose behavior falls outside conventional gender norms.  Furthermore, "genderqueer", by virtue of its ties with [[queer]] culture, carries sociopolitical connotations that ''androgyny'' does not carry.  For these reasons, some androgynes may find the label "genderqueer" inaccurate, inapplicable, or offensive.  "Androgneity" is a viable alternative to "androgyny" for differentiating internal (psychological) factors from external (visual) factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://androgyne.0catch.com/psych.htm#androgyneity |title=Psychological Androgyny -- A Personal Take |accessdate=13 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terms such as "[[bisexual]]", "[[heterosexual]]", and [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] have less meaning for androgynes who do not identify as men or women to begin with. Infrequently the words [[gynephilia and androphilia]] are used, and some describe themselves as androsexual. These words refer to the gender of the person someone is attracted to, but do not imply any particular gender on the part of the person who is feeling the attraction.

[[File:Louisebrooks1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louise Brooks]] exemplified the [[flapper]]. Flappers challenged traditional gender roles, had boyish hair cuts and androgynous figures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_VgLtO4Lby4C&amp;pg=PA253 ''New world coming: the 1920s and the making of modern America'']. New York: Scribner, 2003, p. 253, {{ISBN|978-0-684-85295-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
According to Sandra Bem, androgynous men and women are more flexible and more mentally healthy than either masculine or feminine individuals; undifferentiated individuals are less competent.&lt;ref name="Santrock" /&gt; More recent research has debunked this idea, at least to some extent, and Bem herself has found weaknesses in her original pioneering work. Now she prefers to work with [[gender schema theory]].

To a degree, context influences which gender role is most adaptive.{{Citation needed|reason=really, this entire para. it comes off as slanted, so needs a source to account for the slant|date=October 2015}} In close relationships, a feminine or androgynous gender role may be more desirable because of the expressive nature of close relationships. However, a masculine or androgynous gender role may be more desirable in academic and work settings because of the demands for action and assertiveness.

One study found that masculine and androgynous individuals had higher expectations for being able to control the outcomes of their academic efforts than feminine or undifferentiated individuals.&lt;ref name="Choi"&gt;Choi, N. (2004). Sex role group differences in specific, academic, and general self-efficacy. Journal of Psychology, 138, 149–159.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
To say that a culture or relationship is androgynous is to say that it lacks rigid [[gender role]]s and that the people involved display characteristics or partake in activities traditionally associated with the other sex. The term "androgynous" is often used to refer to a person whose look or build make determining their gender difficult, but is generally not used to describe actual [[intersexuality]], [[transgender]], or [[two-spirit]] people. Occasionally, people who do not actually define themselves as androgynes adapt their physical appearance to look androgynous. This outward androgyny has been used as a fashion statement and some of the milder forms (women wearing men's trousers/men wearing skirts, for example) are not perceived as transgender behavior.

==Physical traits==
[[File:Anasyromenos statuette, Rome art market.JPG|thumb|A statuette of [[Aphroditus]] in the [[anasyromenos]] pose. The ancient Greeks and Romans believed the pose had [[apotropaic magic]]al power.|232x232px]]

Androgynous traits are those that either have no gender value or have some aspects generally attributed to the opposite gender. [[Human body|Physical]] androgyny. Some [[intersex]] and non-intersex people may exhibit androgynous physical traits. This is distinct from androgyny, which concerns personal and social anomalies in gender, and is also distinct from [[psychological]] androgyny, which is a matter of [[gender identity]].&lt;ref name="Definition"/&gt;

==Alternatives==
{{Expand section|date=August 2009}}
An alternative to androgyny is '''gender-role transcendence''': the view that individual competence should be conceptualized on a personal basis rather than on the basis of masculinity, femininity, or androgyny.&lt;ref name="Pleck"&gt;Pleck, J. H. (1995). The gender-role strain paradigm. In R. F. Levant &amp; W. S. Pollack (Ed.s), A new psychology of men. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of the [[metrosexual]] in the first decade of the 2000s has also been described as a related phenomenon associated with this trend. Traditional gender stereotypes have been challenged and reset in recent years dating back to the 1960s, the [[hippie movement]] and [[flower power]]. Artists in film such as [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] sported the "skinny" look in the 1990s, a departure from traditional masculinity which resulted in a fad known as "Leo Mania".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-02-24/entertainment/17359092_1_leonardo-dicaprio-titanic-fan |title=The teenage fans from 'Titanic' days jump ship as Leonardo DiCaprio moves on |date=24 February 2005 |author=Peter Hartlaub |publisher=sfgate.com |accessdate=17 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend came long after musical superstars such as [[David Bowie]], [[Boy George]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Pete Burns]] and [[Annie Lennox]] challenged the norms in the 1970s and had elaborate cross gender wardrobes by the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Musical stars such as [[Brett Anderson]] of the British band [[Suede (band)|Suede]], [[Marilyn Manson]] and the band [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]] have used clothing and makeup to create an androgyny culture throughout the 1990s and the first decade of the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cavendish|first1=Marshall|title=Sex and Society, Vol 1|date=2010|publisher=Paul Bernabeo|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the 1990s unrolled and fashion developed an affinity for [[unisex]] clothes there was a rise of designers who favored that look, like [[Helmut Lang (fashion brand)|Helmut Lang]], [[Giorgio Armani]] and [[Pierre Cardin]], the trends in fashion hit the public mainstream in the 2000s (decade) that featured men sporting different hair styles: longer hair, [[hairdye]]s, hair [[Hair highlighting|highlights]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Men in catalogues started wearing [[jewellery]], [[make up]], [[visual kei]], designer stubble.

[[Image:Bayon Angkor Relief1.jpg|Stone bas-relief at [[Bayon]] temple depicting the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] army at war with the [[Cham (Asia)|Cham]], carved c. 1200 CE|thumb]]
The history of '''Cambodian art''' stretches back centuries to ancient times, but the most famous period is undoubtedly the '''Khmer art''' of the [[Khmer Empire]] (802–1431), especially in the area around [[Angkor]] and the mainly 12th-century temple-complex of [[Angkor Wat]], initially [[Hindu]] and subsequently [[Buddhist]]. After the collapse of the empire these and other sites were abandoned and overgrown, allowing much of the era's stone carving and architecture to survive to the present day.  Traditional Cambodian arts and crafts include [[textiles]], non-textile [[weaving]], [[silversmithing]], [[stone carving]], [[lacquerware]], [[Ceramic art|ceramics]], [[wat]] [[murals]], and [[kite]]-making.  

Beginning in the mid-20th century, a tradition of modern art began in Cambodia, though in the later 20th century both traditional and modern arts declined for several reasons, including the killing of artists by the [[Khmer Rouge]].  The country has experienced a recent artistic revival due to increased support from governments, NGOs, and foreign tourists.

In pre-colonial Cambodia, art and crafts were generally produced either by rural non-specialists for practical use or by skilled artists producing works for the Royal Palace.  In modern Cambodia, many artistic traditions entered a period of decline or even ceased to be practiced, but the country has experienced a recent artistic revival as the tourist market has increased and governments and NGOs have contributed to the preservation of Cambodian culture.

==Stone carving==
{{Main|Khmer sculpture}}
[[Image:Fronton Cambodge Musée Guimet 9972.jpg|Stone carving at [[Banteay Srei]], an [[Angkor]]ian temple consecrated in 967 CE.|thumb]]
Cambodia's best-known stone carving adorns the temples of [[Angkor]], which are "renowned for the scale, richness and detail of their sculpture". In modern times, however, the art of stone carving became rare, largely because older sculptures survived undamaged for centuries (eliminating the need for replacements) and because of the use of cement molds for modern temple architecture.  By the 1970s and 1980s, the craft of stone carving was nearly lost.&lt;ref name=carving&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1828.html "Stone carving"].&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 20th century, however, efforts to restore Angkor resulted in a new demand for skilled stone carvers to replace missing or damaged pieces, and a new tradition of stone carving is arising to meet this need. Most modern carving is traditional-style, but some carvers are experimenting with contemporary designs.  Interest is also renewing for using stone carving in modern wats.  Modern carvings are typically made from [[Banteay Meanchey]] [[sandstone]], though stone from [[Pursat]] and [[Kampong Thom City|Kompong Thom]] is also used.&lt;ref name=carving/&gt;

==Murals==
[[Image:Wat mural.jpg|Portion of a 1903–1904 mural in [[Phnom Penh]]'s [[Silver Pagoda]]|thumb]]

[http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/cambodia/preserving-cultural-tradition-ten-years-after-khme ''Preserving a Cultural Tradition: Ten Years After the Khmer Rouge.''] Cultural Survival. Retrieved 30 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wubin, Zhuang .[http://www.aaa.org.hk/Diaaalogue/Details/1144 ''Mekong Spring: Cambodian Photography in the Last Decade''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609063926/http://www.aaa.org.hk/Diaaalogue/Details/1144 |date=2013-06-09 }} Asia Art Archive. Retrieved 30 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; few historic [[wat]] [[mural]]s remain in Cambodia. In the 1960s, art historians Guy and Jacqueline Nafilyan photographed 19th-century murals, providing a record of this lost cultural heritage. The best known surviving murals are at the [[Silver Pagoda]] in [[Phnom Penh]], [[Wat Rajabo]] in [[Siem Reap province]], and [[Wat Kompong Tralach Leu]] in [[Kompong Chhnang Province]]. In the last decade, wat murals have seen a resurgence, but Cambodia's surviving older murals are generally more refined and detailed.

==Textiles==
[[Image:Pidan textile.jpg|19th century silk ''[[Pidan (textile)|pidan]]''|thumb]]
[[Image:Cambodia weaving.jpg|Cambodian woman weaving silk near [[Siem Reap]], 2007|thumb]]
[[Silk]] [[weaving]] in Cambodia has a long history. The practice dates to as early as the 1st century, and textiles were used in trade during [[Angkor]]ian times. Even modern textile production evidences these historic antecedents: motifs found on silk today often echo clothing details on ancient stone sculptures.&lt;ref name=silk&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1821.html "Silk weaving"].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main types of Cambodian weaving.  The [[ikat]] technique (Khmer: ''chong kiet''), which produces patterned fabric, is quite complex.  To create patterns, weavers tie-dye portions of [[weft]] yarn before weaving begins.  Patterns are diverse and vary by region; common motifs include lattice, stars, and spots.  The second weaving technique, unique to Cambodia, is called "uneven [[twill]]". It yields single or two-color fabrics, which are produced by weaving three threads so that the "color of one thread dominates on one side of the fabric, while the two others determine the colour on the reverse side."&lt;ref name=silk/&gt; Traditionally, Cambodian textiles have employed natural dyes.  Red dye comes from [[lac]] insect nests, blue dye from [[indigo]], yellow and green dye from [[prohut]] bark, and black dye from [[ebony]] bark.&lt;ref name=silk/&gt;

Cambodia's modern silk-weaving centers are [[Takeo]], [[Battambang]], [[Beanteay Meanchey]], [[Siem Reap]] and [[Kampot Province|Kampot]] provinces.    Silk-weaving has seen a major revival recently, with production doubling over the past ten years. This has provided employment for many rural women. Cambodian silk is generally sold domestically, where it is used in ''[[sampot]]'' (wrap skirts), furnishings, and ''[[pidan (textile)|pidan]]'' (pictoral tapestries), but interest in international trade is increasing.&lt;ref name=silk/&gt;

[[Cotton]] textiles have also played a significant role in Cambodian culture. Though today Cambodia imports most of its cotton, traditionally woven cotton remains popular. Rural women often weave homemade cotton fabric, which is used in garments and for household purposes. [[Krama]], the traditional check scarves worn almost universally by Cambodians, are made of cotton.&lt;ref&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1827.html "Cotton weaving (tbanh ambas)"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-textile weaving==
Many Cambodian farmers [[basket weaving|weave baskets]] (Khmer: tbanh kantrak) for household use or as a supplemental source of income.  Most baskets are made of thinly cut bamboo.  Regions known for basketry include [[Siem Reap]] and [[Kampong Cham Province|Kampong Cham]].&lt;ref&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1824.html "Basket weaving (tbanh kantrak)"].&lt;/ref&gt; Mat weaving (tbanh kantuel) is a common seasonal occupation. They are most commonly made from reeds, either left a natural tan color or dyed in deep jewel tones. The region of Cambodia best known for mat weaving is the Mekong floodplain, especially around [[Lvea Em]] district. Mats are commonly laid out for guests and are important building materials for homes.&lt;ref&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1825.html "Mat weaving (tbanh kantuel)"].&lt;/ref&gt; Wicker and rattan crafts (tbanh kanchoeu) made from [[dryandra]] trees are also significant.  Common wicker and rattan products include walls, mats, furniture, and other household items.&lt;ref&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1826.html "Wicker and rattan (tbanh kanchoeu)"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacquerware==
[[Image:Cambodia lacquerware.jpg|A Cambodian woman works on a lacquered vase|thumb]]
The height of Cambodian traditional [[lacquerware]] was between the 12th and 16th centuries; some examples of work from this era, including gilded Buddha images and [[betel]] boxes, have survived to the present day.  Lacquerware was traditionally colored black using burnt wood, representing the underworld; red using mercury, representing the earth; and yellow using arsenic, representing the heavens.  Lacquer on Angkorian stone dates to the 15th or 16th century.&lt;ref name=lacquer&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1829.html "Lacquerware"].&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Cambodia, the art of lacquerwork nearly faded into oblivion: few lacquer trees survived, and lacquer was unavailable in local markets.  Today's revival is still in its infancy, but 100 lacquer artists have been trained by a French expert under the guidance of Artisans d'Angkor, a company that produces traditional crafts in village workshops.  Some artists are "beginning to experiment with different techniques and styles...to produce modern and striking effects."&lt;ref name=lacquer/&gt;

==Silversmithing==
[[Image:Bowl cambodia.jpg|Lotus-shaped Cambodian bowl (gold and silver alloy), made c. 1222 CE|thumb]]
Silversmithing in Cambodia dates back centuries.  The Royal Palace traditionally patronized silversmiths' workshops, and silversmiths remain concentrated at [[Kompong Luong]], near the former royal capital [[Oudong]].  Silver was made into a variety of items, including weaponry, coins, ceremonial objects used in funerary and religious rituals, and betel boxes.  During Cambodia's colonial period, artisans at the School of Fine Art produced celebrated silverwork, and by the late 1930s there were more than 600 silversmiths. Today, silverwork is popular for boxes, jewellery, and souvenir items; these are often adorned with fruit, fire, and Angkor-inspired motifs.  Men produce most of the forms for such work, but women often complete the intricate filigree.&lt;ref&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1822.html "Silversmithing"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceramics==
Cambodian pottery traditions date to 5000 BCE.  Ceramics were mostly used for domestic purposes such as holding food and water. There is no evidence that Khmer ceramics were ever exported, though ceramics were imported from elsewhere in Asia beginning in the 10th century. Ceramics in the shape of birds, elephants, rabbits, and other animals were popular between the 11th and 13th centuries.&lt;ref name=ceramics&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1823.html "Ceramics"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Potting traditionally was done either on a [[pottery wheel]] or using shaping tools such as paddles and anvils. Firing was done in clay kilns, which could reach temperatures of 1,000–1,200 °C, or in the open air, at temperatures of around 700 °C. Primarily green and brown glazes were used.  In rural Cambodia, traditional pottery methods remained.  Many pieces are hand-turned and fired on an open fire without glaze.  The country's major center for pottery is [[Kompong Chhnang Province]].&lt;ref name=ceramics/&gt;

In modern Cambodia, the art of glazed ceramics faded into oblivion: the technique of stoneware stop to be used around 14th century, at the end of Angkor era. Today this technique begin a slow revival through a Belgian ceramist who founded the [[Khmer Ceramics &amp; Fine Arts Centre|Khmer Ceramics &amp; Fine Arts Center]], in Siem Reap, the organization lead vocational training and researches about this lost skill.

==Kites==
Cambodia's kite-making and kite-flying tradition, which dates back many centuries, was revived in the early 1990s and is now extremely popular throughout the country. Kites (Khmer: khleng ek) are generally flown at night during the northeast monsoon season. A bow attached to the kites resonates in the wind, producing a musical sound.&lt;ref&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1866.html "Kite Making"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern and contemporary visual arts==

Cambodia's tradition of modern (representational) drawing, painting, and sculpture was established in the late 1940s at the School of Cambodian Arts (later called the University of Fine Arts), where it occupied much of the school's curriculum a decade later.  These developments were supported by the government, which encouraged new areas of specialization (e.g. design and modern painting) at the school and purchased modern art for the Prime Minister's residences and for government buildings.  Galleries opened in Phnom Penh during the 1960s, and cultural centers hosted exhibitions of modern paintings and provided art libraries.  One important painter of the 1960s was [[Nhek Dim]]; he has become the painter of reference for modern painters.&lt;ref&gt;Vachon, Michelle. "Painting by famed Nhek Dim returns home", ''The Cambodia Daily'', Phnom Penh, 20 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the subsequent Khmer Rouge era, many artists were killed and art production nearly ceased.&lt;ref name=modern&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1792.html "Modern and contemporary visual arts"].&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the Khmer Rouge, artists and professors returned the University of Fine Arts to rebuild arts training.  Socialist Bloc governments sponsored the education of young art students in Poland, Bulgaria, the former Soviet Union, and Hungary during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Other local efforts aimed to re-establish workshops, collect documents, and preserve traditional knowledge.&lt;ref name=modern/&gt;

Though several galleries present changing exhibitions in Phnom Penh, the vast majority of artists cannot support themselves through exhibitions and sales of modern work.  Artists generally earn income from Angkor-inspired art for tourists or from painting commercial signs and large reproductions that in the West would be mechanically produced.&lt;ref name=modern/&gt;

Several broad schools of art exist among modern Cambodian artists.  Some artists, including [[Som Samai]] (a silversmith), [[An Sok]] (a mask-maker), and [[Chet Chan]] (a painter) follow colonial traditions to produce traditional Khmer art.  [[Chhim Sothy]]'s work is also derived from these traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fine Art|first=Angkor|title=Chhim Sothy - Artist|url=http://www.angkorfineart.com/2012/03/09/58/}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Many young artists who studied abroad in the 1980s, including [[Phy Chan Than]], [[Soeung Vannara]], [[Long Sophea]], and [[Prom Sam An]], have presented a modern Khmer art forms combining subjects from Khmer art with Western modernism. Other notable Cambodian artists include Leang Seckon, Pich Sopheap, Svay Ken, Asasax, [http://www.artistdina.com Chhan Dina], Patrick Samnang Mey, Lam Soeung, and Chhorn Bun Son. During the 1990s, Cambodia saw the return of many members of the Khmer diaspora, including several internationally recognized artists.  Among these are [[Marine Ky]] and [[Chath Piersath]].&lt;ref name=modern/&gt;

The official '''coat of arms of [[Grenada]]''' is a shield divided into four parts by a golden cross. In the centre of this cross is the [[Santa María (ship)|''Santa Maria'']], [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus']] flagship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.gd/coa.html |title=Coat of Arms |publisher=[[Government of Grenada]] |accessdate=2008-07-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403072754/http://www.gov.gd/coa.html |archivedate=2008-04-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A British lion on a red field is shown in the upper left and lower right sections of the shield, with a golden crescent moon out of which a [[Lilium|lily]] growsin the upper right and lower left sections. Above the shield there is a golden helmet, topped with a garland of [[bougainvillea]] branches. Within the garland are seven red [[rose]]s, which stand for the seven communities of Grenada. Holding the shield on the dexter side is an [[armadillo]] which stands before a [[maize|corn]] stalk; on the sinister side is a [[Grenada dove]], which stands before a [[banana]] plant. The base represents [[Mount Saint Catherine (Grenada)|Mount St. Catherine]] with the [[Grand Etang Lake]] at the centre. A ribbon displays the national motto: "Ever conscious of God we aspire, build and advance as one people."

The coat of arms was adopted by the [[island nation]] in 1974 following independence.

The term referred to a [[syndicate]] of booksellers, mostly in [[London]], who bought shares to finance the [[book]]'s printing. Each member agreed to take so many copies for sale themselves, and the final profit was split in proportion to the members' initial financial input.&lt;ref&gt; F. A. Mumby, ''Publishing and Bookselling,'' rev. ed.1954, p 141&lt;/ref&gt;   Their names all appeared on the title pages as co-[[publisher]]s, though one of the major publishing houses usually took the lead in setting the deal up.

Prior to the [[Statute of Anne]], the Conger (often seen capitalized)  also had an effect on [[copyright]]. After the printing became common, publishers took the position that having purchased a work from an author, the [[History of copyright|right to control]] its publication continued permanently. Courts supported the claim via precedent, until the Statute was passed early in the 18th century, after which it was law that literary works went into the [[public domain]] after a fixed time set by statute. &lt;ref&gt;F. A. Mumby, ''Publishing and Bookselling,'' rev. ed.1954, p 139-40, Based on [[Augustine Birrell]], ''Seven Lectures on the Law and History of Copyright in Books'', 1899 &lt;/ref&gt;

This system seems to have been mostly used in the financing of major projects -- for example, multi-volume works such as [[encyclopedia]]s. Shares were often subdivided and re-sold, so the actual balance of ownership became very convoluted.

The '''Dahomey Amazons''' or '''''Mino''''', which means "our mothers," were a [[Fon people|Fon]] all-female military regiment of the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]] in the present-day [[Republic of Benin]] which lasted until the end of the 19th century. They were so named by Western observers and historians due to their similarity to the mythical [[Amazons]] of ancient [[Anatolia]] and the [[Black Sea]].

==Origin==
[[File:Dahomey amazon2.jpg|right|frame|Dahomey Amazons in around 1890]]
King [[Houegbadja]] (who ruled from 1645 to 1685), the third King of [[Dahomey]], is said to have originally started the group which would become the Amazons as a corps of elephant hunters called the ''gbeto''.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=20}}

Houegbadja's son King [[Agaja]] (ruling from 1708 to 1732) established a female bodyguard armed with muskets. European merchants recorded their presence. According to tradition, Agaja developed the bodyguard into a militia and successfully used them in Dahomey's defeat of the neighbouring kingdom of [[Savi]] in 1727.{{sfn|Law|1993|p=}} The group of female warriors was referred to as ''Mino'', meaning "Our Mothers" in the [[Fon language]], by the male army of Dahomey.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=44}} Other sources contest that King Agaja's older sister Queen Hangbe was the ruler to establish the units, however some contest if Queen Hangbe actually existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180826-the-legend-of-benins-fearless-female-warriors|title=The legend of Benin’s fearless female warriors|last=Macdonald|first=Fleur|language=en|access-date=2018-08-26|date=2018-08-26|website=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of King [[Ghezo]] (ruling from 1818 to 1858), Dahomey became increasingly militaristic. Ghezo placed great importance on the army, increasing its budget and formalizing its structure from ceremonial to a serious military. While European narratives refer to the women soldiers as "Amazons", they called themselves ''ahosi'' (king's wives) or ''Mino'' (our mothers).{{sfn|Law|1993|p=}} Europeans exchanged goods such as knives, bayonets, firearms and fabrics for prisoners that the Dahomey captured during wars and raids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02fdq|title=Dahomey - Google Arts &amp; Culture|work=Google Cultural Institute|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recruitment==
[[File:Dahomey amazon1.jpg|thumb|[[Seh-Dong-Hong-Beh]], a leader of the Amazons]]
Ghezo recruited both men and women soldiers from foreign captives, though women soldiers were also recruited from free Dahomean women, some enrolled as young as 8 years old.{{sfn|Law|1993|p=}} Other accounts indicate that the ''Mino'' were recruited from among the ''ahosi'' ("king's wives") of which there were often hundreds.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=38}} Some women in Fon society became soldiers voluntarily, while others were [[conscription|involuntarily enrolled]] if their husbands or fathers complained to the king about their behavior.

Membership among the ''Mino'' was supposed to hone any aggressive character traits for the purpose of war. During their membership they were not allowed to have children or be part of married life (though they were legally married to the king). Many of them were virgins. The regiment had a semi-sacred status, which was intertwined with the [[Fon people|Fon]] belief in [[Vodun]].

The ''Mino'' trained with intense physical exercise. They learnt survival skills and indifference to pain and death, storming [[acacia]]-thorn defenses in [[military exercises]] and executing prisoners.{{sfn|Dash|2011}} Discipline was emphasised.

Serving in the ''Mino'' offered women the opportunity to "rise to positions of command and influence" in an environment structured for individual empowerment.{{sfn|Law|1993|p=}} The ''Mino'' were also wealthy and held high status.{{sfn|Dash|2011}}

==Political role==
The ''Mino'' took a prominent role in the Grand Council, debating the policy of the kingdom. From the 1840s to 1870s (when the opposing party collapsed), they generally supported peace with [[Abeokuta]] and stronger commercial relations with England, favouring the trade in [[palm oil]] above that in slaves; this set them at odds with their male military colleagues.{{sfn|Yoder|1974}}

Apart from the Council, the [[Annual Customs of Dahomey]] included a parade and reviewing of the troops, and the troops swearing of an oath to the king. The celebrations on the 27th day of the Annual Customs  consisted of a mock battle in which the Amazons attacked a "fort" and "captured" the slaves within,{{sfn|Yoder|1974}} a custom recorded by the priest Francesco Borghero in his diaries.{{sfn|Dash|2011}}

==Combat and structure==
The women soldiers were rigorously trained and given uniforms. By the mid-19th century, they numbered between 1,000 and 6,000 women, about a third of the entire Dahomey army, according to reports written by visitors. These documented reports also indicated that the women soldiers suffered several defeats.

The women soldiers were said to be structured in parallel with the army as a whole, with a center wing (the king's bodyguards) flanked on both sides, each under separate commanders. Some accounts note that each male soldier had a female warrior counterpart.{{sfn|Law|1993|p=}} In an 1849/50 account by an Englishman, it was documented that the women that had three stripes of [[whitewash]] around each leg, were honored with marks of distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dahomey And The Dahomans: Being The Journals Of Two Missions To The King Of Dahomey And Residence At His Capital 1849 To 1850|last=Forbes|first=Frederick|publisher=Kessinger Publishing LLC|year=2010|isbn=978-1163235027|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women's army consisted of a number of regiments: huntresses, riflewomen, reapers, archers, and gunners. Each regiment had different uniforms, weapons and commanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/womeninafrica/women-soldiers-dahomey/pedagogical-unit/4|title=The women soldiers of Dahomey pedagogical unit 4 {{!}} Women|website=en.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter period, the Dahomean female warriors were armed with Winchester rifles, clubs and knives. Units were under female command. A 1851 published translation of a war chant of the women claims the warriors would chant, "a[s] the [[blacksmith]] takes an iron bar and by fire changes its fashion so have we changed our nature. We are no longer women, we are men."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Maeve|date=Spring 2010|title=The Amazon Warrior Women and the De/construction of Gendered Imperial Authority in Nineteenth-Century Colonial Literature|url=http://m.ncgsjournal.com/issue61/New%20PDFs/NCGS%20Journal%20Issue%206.1%20-%20The%20Amazon%20Warrior%20Woman%20-%20Maeve%20E.%20Adams.pdf|journal=Nineteenth-Century Gender Studies|volume=6|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Conflict with neighbouring kingdoms===
The Dahomey kingdom was [[History of the Kingdom of Dahomey|often at war]] with its neighbors, and captives were needed for the [[History of slavery|slave trade]]. The Dahomey women soldiers fought in slave raids, as referenced in the Zora Neale Hurston non-fiction work  [[Barracoon: The Story of the Last "Black Cargo"|Baracoon]], and in the unsuccessful wars against [[Abeokuta]].

==Conflict with France==

=== First Franco-Dahomean War ===
European encroachment into West Africa gained pace during the latter half of the 19th century, and in 1890 King [[Béhanzin]] started fighting French forces in the course of the [[First Franco-Dahomean War]]. European observers noted that they "handled admirably" in hand to hand combat, but that they did not know how to use their flintlocks.{{sfn|Dash|2011}} The Amazons participated in one major battle: Cotonou, where thousands of Dahoney (including many Amazons) charged the French lines and engaged the defenders in hand-to-hand combat. Despite the compliments given to them by the Europeans, the Amazons were decisively crushed, with several hundred Dahomey troops being gunned down while 129 Dahomey were killed in melee combat within the French lines. The French lost 5 men killed and a few dozen wounded.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=195}} 

=== Second Franco-Dahomean War ===
According to Holmes, many of the French soldiers fighting in Dahomey hesitated before shooting or bayoneting the Amazons. The resulting delay led to many of the French casualties. By the end of the [[Second Franco-Dahomean War]], special units of the Amazons were being assigned specifically to target French officers.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=|pp=205}} After several battles, the French prevailed in the [[Second Franco-Dahomean War]] and put an end to the independent Dahomean kingdom. The legionnaires were impressed by the boldness of the Amazons and later wrote about the "incredible courage and audacity." Against a military unit with decidedly superior weaponry and a longer bayonet, however, the Dahomey Amazons could not prevail.&lt;ref&gt;Yoder, John C. (1974). "Fly and Elephant Parties: Political Polarization in Dahomey, 1840-1870". The Journal of African History. 15 (3): 417–432. doi:10.1017/s0021853700013566. &lt;/ref&gt; During a battle with French soldiers at [[Second Franco-Dahomean War#Battle of Adégon|Adegon]] on October 6 during the second war, the bulk of the Amazon corps were wiped out in a matter of hours in hand-to-hand combat after the French engaged them with a bayonet charge. For the loss of 86 Regulars and 417 Amazons, the Dahomey only managed to kill 6 French troops in the melee.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=203}}

==Disbandment==
[[File:The célébration at Abomey(1908). - The veteran amazones( AHOSI ) of the Fon king Béhanzin, Son of Roi Gélé.jpg|Veterans at in 1908.|thumb|Veterans at the annual meeting in Abomay in 1908]]
The troops were disbanded when the kingdom became a French [[protectorate]].{{sfn|Historical Museum of Abomey}} Oral tradition states that some surviving amazons secretly remained in Abomey afterwards, where they quietly assassinated a number of French officers. Other stories say the women pledged their services in protection of [[Agoli-agbo|Agoli-Agbo]], the brother of [[Béhanzin]], disguising themselves as his wives in order to guard him.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|pp=208-209}}

Some of the women married and had children, while others remained single. According to a historian who traced the lives of almost two dozen ex-amazons, all the women displayed difficulties adjusting to life as retired warriors, often struggling to find new roles in their communities that gave them a sense of pride comparable to their former lives. Many displayed a tendency to start fights or arguments that frightened their neighbours and relatives.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|pp=208-209}}

Between 1934 and 1942, several British travelers in [[Abomey]] recorded encounters with ex-amazons, now old women who spun cotton or idled around courtyards.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|pp=210-211}} The last survivor of the Dahomey Amazons is thought to have been a woman named Nawi. In a 1978 interview with a [[Benin|Beninese]] historian, Nawi claimed to have fought the French in 1892. Nawi died in November 1979, aged well over 100.{{sfn|Dash|2011}}

==In popular culture==

{{in popular culture|date=October 2018}}{{refimprove|date=October 2018}}
Dahomey Amazons were represented in the 1987 film ''[[Cobra Verde]]'' by [[German people|German]] director [[Werner Herzog]]. Ghezo's Amazons play a significant role in the novel ''[[Flash for Freedom!]]'' by [[George MacDonald Fraser]].

The unit is also depicted in (a special edition of, and now [[Downloadable content|DLC]] of) PC game ''[[Empire: Total War]]''. In the African Kingdoms expansion to ''[[Age of Empires II]]'', Gbeto are the Malian unique unit. In either game, the Dahomey/Gbeto are the only female military units.

A segment of ''[[QI]]'' Series 7 Episode 7 discussed Dahomey Amazons and showed a photo.

Referenced in [[Stieg Larsson]]'s novel ''[[The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest]]'' in the prelude to Part 4 ''Rebooting System''.

The warriors are also mentioned in [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s novel ''[[The Commodore]]'', book 17 of the [[Aubrey-Maturin series]].

The main character of [[Charles R. Saunders]] fantasy novel ''Dossouye'', an ahosi of Abomey, is closely modelled on the Dahomey ahosi.

[[P. C. Wren]]'s 1917 book of short stories ''[[Stepsons of France]]'' contains a story called ''"Here are Ladies"'', describing a series of clashes between troops of the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] and the Dahomey Amazons.

The warriors are also the main focus and written about in [[Layon Gray]]'s stage play ''[[Black Sparta]]''.{{sfn|Clodfelter|2017}}

The [[Dora Milaje]], army/bodyguards to the ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'', are based partially off the Dahomey Amazons.{{sfn|Johnson|2018}}

In [[Zora Neale Hurston]]’s ''[[Barracoon: The Story of the Last "Black Cargo"|Barracoon]]'', 86 year old Cudjo Lewis, the last known survivor of the slaver [[Clotilda (slave ship)|Clotilda]], describes his own capture by Dahomey Amazons when he was 19 years old.

'''''Dīvān-e Kabīr''''' or '''''Dīvān-e Šams-e Tabrīzī''''' ''(The Works of [[Shams Tabrizi|Šams Tabrīzī]])'' ({{Lang-fa|دیوان شمس تبریزی}}) or '''''Dīvān-e Šams''''' is one of [[Mawlānā Jalāl-ad-Dīn Muhammad Balkhī]]'s masterpieces. A collection of lyric poems that contains more than 40,000 verses, it is written in the [[New Persian]] language and is considered one of the greatest works of [[Persian literature]]. 

''Dīvān-e Kabīr'' ("the great divan") contains poems in several different styles of Eastern-Islamic poetry (e.g. odes, eulogies, quatrains, etc.). It contains 44,282 lines (according to Foruzanfar's edition,&lt;ref&gt;Furuzanfar, Badi-uz-zaman. ''Kulliyat-e Shams'', 8 vols., Tehran: Amir Kabir Press, 1957–66. Critical edition of the collected odes, qutrains and other poems of Rumi with glossary and notes.&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on the oldest manuscripts available): 3,229 odes, or ghazals (total lines = 34,662); 44 tarji-bands (total lines = 1698); and 1,983 quatrains (total lines = 7932).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dar-al-masnavi.org/about_divan.html|title=About the Divan|work=dar-al-masnavi.org|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the poems are in [[New Persian]], there are also some in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and a small number of mixed Persian/Greek and Persian/Turkish poems. ''Dīvān-e Šams-e Tabrīzī'' is named in honour of Rumi's spiritual teacher and friend [[Shams Tabrizi]].

The following are Greek verses in the poetry of [[Rumi|Mawlana Jalal ad-Din Rumi]] (1207-1273), and his son, [[Sultan Walad]] (1226-1312). The works have been difficult to edit, because of the absence of vowel pointing in most of the verses, and the confusion of scribes unfamiliar with Greek; different editions of the verses vary greatly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opoudjis.net/Play/rumiwalad.html|title=Untitled Document|website=www.opoudjis.net|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

'''''Dulle Griet''''' ([[Anglicisation|anglicized]] as '''''Dull Gret'''''), also known as '''''Mad Meg''''', is a figure of [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[folklore]] who is the subject of a 1563 oil-on-panel by [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|Flemish renaissance]] artist [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]. The painting depicts a [[virago]], Dulle Griet, who leads an army of women to pillage [[Hell]],&lt;ref&gt;Dulle Griet is also the subject of a 1640s painting by Flemish painter [[David Teniers the Younger]].&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently held and exhibited at the [[Museum Mayer van den Bergh]] in [[Antwerp]]. (Temporarily in Vienna from October 2018 to January 13 2019)

==History and description==
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Dulle Griet (detail) - WGA03402.jpg|thumb|Mad Meg (detail)]]
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Dulle Griet (detail) - WGA03404.jpg|thumb|Anthropomorphic mouth of Hell with monsters]]

A restoration of the painting in 2018 revealed that it was painted in 1563, shortly after the painter had moved to Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bruzz.be/videoreeks/de-meesterwerken/video-de-meesterwerken-een-feministisch-schilderij De Meesterwerken: 'Een feministisch schilderij'] at {{url|www.bruzz.be}} {{lang icon|nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the signature and the date on the painting had been illegible, and it was assumed that it was painted two years earlier,&lt;ref&gt;Doruntina Islamaj. [https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/03/01/schilderij--de-dulle-griet--is-twee-jaar-jonger-dan-gedacht/ Schilderij "De dulle griet" is twee jaar jonger dan gedacht] at [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]] website, 1&amp;nbsp;March 2018 {{lang icon|nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, based on its close compositional and stylistic similarity to ''[[The Fall of the Rebel Angels (Bruegel)|The Fall of the Rebel Angels]]'' and ''[[The Triumph of Death]]'', one year earlier. Like those pictures, ''Dulle Griet'' owes much to [[Hieronymus Bosch]]. It is assumed the painting was destined for a series.&lt;ref name=Skira2003&gt;Cf. Pietro Allegretti. ''Brueghel''. Milan: Skira, 2003. {{ISBN|0-00-001088-X}} {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruegel's earliest biographer, [[Karel van Mander]], writing in 1604, described the painting as "Dulle Griet, who is looking at the mouth of Hell". It came into the collections of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]], then was looted by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] troops in 1648, and reappeared in [[Stockholm]] in 1800. Art collector [[Museum Mayer van den Bergh|Fritz Mayer van den Bergh]] discovered it in 1897 at an auction in [[Cologne]], where he bought it for a minimal sum, discovering its actual author a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museum.antwerpen.be/mayervandenbergh//index_eng.html |title=Museum Mayer van den Bergh |publisher=Museum.antwerpen.be |date=2013-11-30 |accessdate=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/pieterbruegeldul00puyv Pieter Bruegel : The Dulle Griet, in the Mayer van den Bergh Museum, Antwerp], by Leo van Puyvelde, publication in 1900 for the Museum Mayer van den Bergh&lt;/ref&gt;

Griet was a disparaging name given to any bad-tempered, shrewish woman. Her mission refers to the [[Netherlandish Proverbs|Flemish]] proverb:&lt;blockquote&gt;''She could plunder in front of hell and return unscathed.''&lt;/blockquote&gt; Bruegel is thus making fun of noisy, aggressive women. At the same time he castigates the sin of covetousness: although already burdened down with possessions, Griet and her grotesque companions are prepared to storm the mouth of Hell itself in their search for more.&lt;ref&gt;Max Seidel, Roger H. Marijnissen. ''Bruegel''. Pt.2, Random House, 1985. {{ISBN|0-517-44772-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dulle Griet appears as a character in [[Caryl Churchill]]'s play ''[[Top Girls]]'' (1982), where she recounts her invasion of Hell: "I'd had enough, I was mad, I hate the bastards. I come out my front door that morning and shout till my neighbors come out and I said, 'Come on, we're going where the evil come from and pay the bastards out.'" (Churchill, 28).

===Details===
While her female followers loot a house, Griet advances towards the mouth of Hell through a landscape populated by [[Hieronymus Bosch|Boschian]] monsters (see detailed images).  They represent the sins that are punished there. Griet wears male armour — a breastplate, a mailed glove and a metal cap; her military costume is parodied by the monster in a helmet beside her, who pulls up a [[drawbridge]]. A knife hangs from her side, while in her right she carries a sword, which may refer to the saying: "He could go to Hell with a sword in his hand." A book of proverbs published in [[Antwerp]] in 1568 contains a saying which is very close in spirit to Bruegel's painting:&lt;blockquote&gt; ''One woman makes a din, two women a lot of trouble, three an annual market, four a quarrel, five an army, and against six the Devil himself has no weapon.''&lt;ref&gt;Cf. The Netherlandish Proverbs: An International Symposium on the Pieter Brueg(h)els, ed. by [[Wolfgang Mieder]]. University of Vermont. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Painting materials==
The pigment analysis was conducted by the scientists at the [[Ghent University]].&lt;ref&gt;Lien Van de Voordea, Jolien Van Pevenageb, Kaat De Langhec, Robin De Wolfa, Bart Vekemansa, Laszlo Vinczea, Peter Vandenabeelec, Maximiliaan P.J. Martens, Non-destructive in situ study of “Mad Meg” by Pieter Bruegel the Elder using mobile X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectrometers, Spectrochimica Acta Part B Atomic Spectroscopy&lt;/ref&gt; Bruegel used the cheap [[smalt]] for the robe of the central figure of Mad Meg instead of the more expensive [[ultramarine]] together with [[vermilion]] and copper resinate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/bruegel-mad-meg/ Pieter Bruegel, Mad Meg (Dulle Griet)], at ColourLex&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ellen Heaton'''  (1816–1894) was a philanthropist and art collector in [[Leeds]], best known for her patronage of and friendships with members and associates of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] and the influential art critic [[John Ruskin]].&lt;ref name="MoistBanash2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kevin M. Moist|author2=David Banash|title=Contemporary Collecting: Objects, Practices, and the Fate of Things|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vrCFs7lKJM8C&amp;pg=PA181|date=9 May 2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-9114-2|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Heaton was born on 8 November 1816 at 7 [[Briggate, Leeds]], the daughter of bookseller John Heaton and sister of physician John Deakin Heaton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Macleod|first1=Diane|title=Oxford DNB Article: Heaton, Ellen|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/62814|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discouraged from continuing her studies by the prevailing antipathy towards female education, she joined [[Leeds Literary and Philosophical Society]] (of which her brother was, at one time, President).

In her account of the Pre-Raphaelite movement, [[Fiona MacCarthy]] describes her as "a wealthy, well-travelled, forthright maiden lady." She was less keen on the more sensual and erotic Pre-Raphaelite paintings, and left Ruskin embarrassed when she refused a Burne-Jones painting he had brought to her attention.&lt;ref name="MacCarthy2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fiona MacCarthy|title=The Last Pre-Raphaelite: Edward Burne-Jones and the Victorian Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YA-_nl_N-a4C&amp;pg=PA122|date=5 March 2012|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06556-7|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her house is now the campus of the Swarthmore Education Centre, which holds an annual lecture in her memory.&lt;ref name="Ellen Heaton Lecture 2012 flyer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ellen Heaton Lecture 2012 flyer|url=http://www.swarthmore.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Ellen-Heaton-Lecture-2012-porrait-A6.pdf|publisher=Swarthmore|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Joshua Abraham Norton]]''' (c.1818 &amp;ndash; January 8, 1880), also known as Norton I or '''Emperor Norton''', was a celebrated citizen of [[San Francisco]] who in 1859 proclaimed himself "Emperor of these United States and Protector of Mexico." Though he was generally considered insane, or at least highly [[eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]], the citizens of San Francisco in the mid to late nineteenth century celebrated Norton's regal presence and his deeds. He continues to be a patron saint of the unusual and of eccentrics, and he is recognized as a Saint in the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'' (1970), the main text of the [[Discordianism|Discordian]] religion.

==History==

===Biography and nonfiction===
* William Drury's 1986 biography, ''Norton I: Emperor of the United States'', is recognized as the authoritative book-length historical account of the life of Emperor Norton.
* The 2007 book, ''Eccentrics, Heroes, and Cutthroats of Old Berkeley'', by Richard Schwartz, includes a chapter on Emperor Norton.
* Emperor Norton was one of 15 "eccentrics" featured in the student reader, [http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;endeca=1&amp;isbn=0890611092&amp;itm=14 ''Eccentrics''], by Henry and Melissa Billings.
* [[Giles Milton]]'s book "When Hitler Took Cocaine and Lenin Lost His Brain" provides a brief description of Emperor Norton's "reign".

Richard Miller's ''Sparkletack'' series of historical podcasts includes a celebrated 2005 episode, "Emperor Norton."

==Literature==

===Novels, stories and plays===
* ''The Duke of Sacramento: A Comedy in Four Acts'', by Warren Baer, is an 1856 play based on the "pre-Imperial" career of Joshua Abraham Norton.
* In 1861, the new Tucker's Hall in San Francisco opened with a comic opera titled ''Norton the First, or, An Emperor for a Day.''
* In 1873, in San Francisco, an original burlesque titled ''The Gold Demon'' featured future theater impresario David Belasco as Emperor Norton.
* Emperor Norton inspired the character of "the King" in [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]''. [https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/people/i_r/norton.htm] Twain was resident in San Francisco during part of Emperor Norton's "reign."
* Emperor Norton appears as himself in [[Robert Louis Stevenson|Robert Louis Stevenson’s]] 1892 novel ''The Wrecker'', written with his stepson, Lloyd Osbourne.
* [[Christopher Moore (author)|Christopher Moore]]'s novels ''[[Bloodsucking Fiends]]'', ''[[A Dirty Job]]'', ''[[You Suck|You Suck: A Love Story]]'', and ''[[Bite Me (novel)|Bite Me! A Love Story]]'' feature a character based on Norton in contemporary San Francisco, referred to as "the Emperor of San Francisco" and accompanied by his dogs [[Bummer and Lazarus]].
* The story and ideas of Emperor Norton are lovingly related in several books by [[Robert Anton Wilson]], most notably ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' of novels, co-authored with [[Robert Shea]], and a sequel, ''[[Schrödinger's cat in popular culture#Books|Schrödinger's Cat]]''.
* The opera of Emperor Norton is being composed and written by one of the lesser characters in the novel ''Factotum'' by [[Charles Bukowski]].
* Dianne Day's San Francisco-based "Fremont Jones" mystery series includes the novel ''Emperor Norton's Ghost'' (1998), in which a friend of the intrepid investigator claims to be communicating with the late Emperor about some unfinished business.
* Emperor Norton is the probable basis for the [[Selma Lagerlöf]] novel, ''Kejsarn av Portugallien'' (''[[The Emperor of Portugallia]]''), the story of a rural Swedish man so disturbed by his daughter's leaving home that he goes mad and declares himself the emperor of Portugallia, parading through the streets of his village wearing a long robe and a bizarre piece of headgear. The 1925 film ''[[The Tower of Lies]]'' is based on the book.
* Steve Bartholomew's novel, ''The Imaginary Emperor: A Tale of Old San Francisco'', was published in 2011.
* David St. John's historical novel, "An Emperor Among Us", presents the story of Emperor Norton's life through the lens of Mark Twain. It was published in 2012.
* [[L. Neil Smith]]'s novel ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' in the ''[[North American Confederacy]] Series'' prominently features action set at Emperor Norton University.
* Emperor Norton and the dogs [[Bummer and Lazarus]] make a brief appearance in [[Barbara Hambly]]'s ''[[Ishmael (Star Trek)|Ishmael]]'', a novel set in the [[Star Trek]] universe.
* T.A. Pratt's novel ''Blood Engines'' makes a reference to Emperor Norton through a cameo by Norton's appointed (and very powerful) Court Magician.
* There are references to "The Emperor of San Francisco" in the science fiction novel ''The Woman Between the Worlds'' by [[F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre]].
* The character of Mr. Crazy in the novel ''Dark Hearts Of Chicago'' by [[William Horwood (novelist)|William Horwood]] and [[Helen Rappaport]] is based on Norton.
* Emperor Norton makes a cameo appearance in the novel ''The Golden Nineties'' by [[Lisa Mason (writer)|Lisa Mason]].
* Sara Harvey's short story ''Allegiance to a Dead Man'' features the ghost of Emperor Norton as one of the two protagonists. The story was published as an e-book in 2011.
* A short story by [[Robert Silverberg]], "The Palace at Midnight", features a post-apocalyptic California with an Empire of San Francisco. The Emperor at the time of the story is a decrepit and senile Norton the Seventh.
* The San Francisco-based Rock Band Land program of classes and camps for children produced an audio story, ''King Bobby of the Village Village'', in which the main character, King Bobby, appears to be heavily based on Emperor Norton.

===Comic book series===
* The story of Emperor Norton was used by [[Neil Gaiman]] in "Three Septembers and a January", an issue of his ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|Sandman]]'' comic-book series (included in the collection ''[[The Sandman: Fables and Reflections|Fables and Reflections]]''). Gaiman's Norton is a victim of [[Despair (DC Comics)|Despair]] until Despair's brother, [[Dream (DC Comics)|Dream]], gives him the dream of royalty. Dream's sister [[Delirium (DC Comics)|Delirium]] notes that Norton's fantasy of Imperial power keeps him from true insanity, observing that "he should belong to me, but he doesn't ... his madness keeps him sane." In later issues collected in ''[[The Sandman: Worlds' End|Worlds' End]]'', it is mentioned that a movement started in [[San Francisco]] sought to declare [[Prez (DC Comics)|Prez Rickard]] Emperor of the United States, and a figure resembling Norton appears in one of the later stories marching in a procession.
* The character of "His Imperial Highness Smith" in the Belgian Comic "[[Lucky Luke]]: L'empereur Smith" (1976), by [[Morris (comics)|Morris]] and [[René Goscinny]], is loosely based on Norton. In contrast to the historical Norton, at the time that he declared himself emperor, the fictional Smith remains a successful businessman. In fact it is becoming fabulously rich that gave him his delusions of grandeur. He is capable of maintaining his own private army which an outlaw manipulates him into using to "reconquer" the United States before Lucky Luke stops him. In spite of the drama arising from the manipulations, Smith is never described as malicious, probably in respect of the "real" emperor. At the end of the comic book, a page is devoted to a short biography of the real Emperor Norton.
* [[Ted Naifeh]]'s fantasy comic ''[[Polly and the Pirates]]'' features an Emperor Joshua who is modeled after Norton.

===Role-playing games===
* Emperor Norton I is the ruler of the Bear Flag Empire (encompassing the modern-day states of California, Oregon, and Washington) in [[R.

'''Fashion Illustration''' is the art of communicating [[fashion]] ideas in a visual form that originates with [[illustration]], [[drawing]] and [[painting]] and also known as Fashion sketching. It is mainly used by [[fashion designers]] to brainstorm their ideas on to paper or computer, using digital software like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, which helps them to communicate easily with their team. Fashion sketching plays a major role in designing to preview and visualize designers thoughts and make decisions before going to actual clothing to reduce any wastage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sewingnpatterns.com/truth-about-fashion-sketching The Truth About Fashion Sketching], sewingnpatterns.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from [[fashion designers]], [[fashion illustrators]] get commissioned for reproduction in [[fashion magazine]]s as one part of an editorial feature or for the purpose of advertising and promoting fashion makers, fashion boutiques and department stores.

==History==
Fashion [[illustration]] has been around for nearly 500 years.  Ever since clothes have been in existence, and there has been a need to translate an idea or image into a fashion illustration.  Not only do fashion illustrations show a representation or design of a garment but they also serve as a form of art. Fashion illustration shows the presence of hand and is said to be a visual luxury. (Drake, 9).

More recently, there has been a decline of fashion illustration in the late 1930s when ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' began to replace its celebrated illustrated covers with photographic images.  This was a major turning point in the fashion industry. Laird Borrelli, author of Fashion Illustration Now states,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fashion Illustration has gone from being one of the sole means of fashion communication to having a very minor role. The first photographic cover of Vogue was a watershed in the history of fashion illustration and a watershed mark of its decline. Photographs, no matter how altered or retouched, will always have some association with reality and by association truth. I like to think of them [fashion Illustrations] as prose poems and having more fictional narratives. They are more obviously filtered through an individual vision than photos. Illustration lives on, but in the position of a poor relative to the fashion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Process of Fashion Illustration==
A designer starts with an inspiration and brainstorm ideas to rough sketches on sketchbook.These rough sketches are then transferred to [[croquis]] and rendered to a fashion sketch applying the texture, color, pattern and details with the help of art materials.

The '''flag of British Columbia''' is based upon the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] of the [[Coat of Arms of British Columbia|provincial arms of British Columbia]]. At the top of the flag is a rendition of the [[Union Jack|Royal Union Flag]], [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] in the centre by a crown, and with a [[sunset|setting sun]] below, representing the location of the province of [[British Columbia]] at the western end of Canada.

==History==
From 1870 to 1906, British Columbia was occasionally represented by a modified British [[blue ensign]] featuring various forms of the great seal of the [[Colony of British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://contentdm.library.uvic.ca/cdm/compoundobject/collection/veh/id/1573/|title=Victoria illustrated|author=Victoria Daily Colonist}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The current flag of British Columbia was based upon the 1906 arms of the province, designed by [[Anglican]] priest Canon Arthur John Beanlands of Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1355083/British-Columbia-flag-of/|title=British Columbia, flag of|author=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the arms featured the Union Flag on the bottom. This was changed as it conflicted with the expression "[[The empire on which the sun never sets|The sun never sets on the British Empire]]." Based upon Beanlands' revised design, the flag of British Columbia was introduced on June 14, 1960, by Premier [[W. A. C. Bennett]], and was first flown on board the [[BC Ferries]] motor vessel ''Sidney'' (later ''[[MV Queen of Sidney|Queen of Sidney]]'').

==Design==
The four wavy white and three wavy blue lines symbolise the province's location between the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The setting sun represents the fact that British Columbia is Canada's westernmost province. The sun may also reflect the provincial motto "Splendor sine occasu" (beauty without diminish)—or, in other words, the sun that never sets (on the British Empire). In Canada, it could be argued, the Empire lives on in the country's symbols and parliamentary institutions. The [[Union Flag]] on top reflects the province's British heritage, while the crown in the centre represents British Columbia  becoming a Crown colony and achieving responsible government. [[Royal family of Canada|Canadian Royal Family]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The flag has an aspect ratio of 3:5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.bc.ca/bcfacts/|title=B.C. Facts|accessdate=January 30, 2008|work=Province of British Columbia|author=Government of British Columbia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707193800/http://www.gov.bc.ca/bcfacts/|archivedate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A stylised version of the flag that appears on [[Vehicle registration plates of British Columbia|British Columbia licence plates]] incorrectly features the setting sun overlapping the Union Flag instead of the waves.

The flag of British Columbia is similar to the [[flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory]]. It also bears similarities to the arms of [[Suffolk County Council]], the local authority of the county of [[Suffolk]] in the United Kingdom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2969">The '''''Wissenschaftsrat''''' (''WR''; Council of Science and Humanities) is an advisory body to the German Federal Government and the state (''Länder'') governments. It makes recommendations on the development of science, research, and the universities, as well as on the competitiveness of German science. These recommendations involve both quantitative and financial considerations, as well as their implementation. Funding is provided by the federal and state governments.&lt;ref name="Aufgaben - Organization"&gt;'' [http://www.wissenschaftsrat.de/Aufgaben/aufg_org.htm Aufgaben - Organization]'' – Functions and Organization&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Wissenschaftliche Kommission'' (Scientific Commission) of the ''Wissenschaftsrat'' has 32 members appointed by the Federal President. Twenty-four scientists are jointly proposed by the ''[[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]'' (DFG, German Research Foundation), the ''Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften'' (MPG, [[Max Planck Society]] for the Advancement of Science), the ''Hochschulrektorenkonferenz'' (HRK, German Rector’s Conference), the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]], the ''Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft'' (FhG, [[Fraunhofer Society]]), and the ''Wissenschaftsgemeinschaft Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz'' (WGL, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community]]).

[[File:Gorky_Park_01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A kitsch replica of the ''Girl with an Oar'' in [[Gorky Park, Moscow]] ]]
The '''''Girl with an Oar''''' ({{lang-ru|Девушка с веслом}}) is an archetypal example of [[Socialist Realism]] in outdoors architecture of the [[Soviet Union]], "an idiom of the Soviet [[kitsch]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111904583204576542502256100040 "The Oar Girl Returns to Moscow, in Her Natural State"]&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous [[gypsum alabaster]] versions authored by [[Ivan Shadr]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://lenta.ru/news/2011/08/29/devushka/]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Romuald Iodko]] adorned Soviet [[park of culture and recreation|parks of culture and recreation]], and [[young pioneer camp]]s.

Seen as a symbol of Soviet erotica and totalitarianism today, it was part of the [[monumental propaganda]] of sports, a model of a healthy person, ubiquitous in Soviet arts of late 1920s–1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.day.kiev.ua/en/article/time-out/girl-paddle-symbol-soviet-totalitarianism-and-erotica "The Girl with a Paddle as a symbol of Soviet totalitarianism and erotica"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ''Girl with an Oar'' by Shadr was that of a naked girl. It was heavily criticized for being "too vulgar". It was destroyed and known only from a single photo. The second one was naked as well, "more chaste" but still naked.&lt;ref name =canoe&gt;[http://www.online812.ru/2011/06/14/0111 "Чем новая «Девушка с веслом», которую поставили в ЦПКиО, отличается от старой"]&lt;/ref&gt; Initially installed in [[Gorky Park (Moscow)|Gorky Park]], Moscow, it was criticized as well and eventually "disappeared", and Shadr made another copy to be installed in [[Luhansk]], [[Ukrainian SSR]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliotekar.ru/encSlov/5/35.htm "Девушка с веслом"] in "Encyclopedic Dictionary of Winged Words and Expressions, by Vadim Serov&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular stereotype of the ''Girl with an Oar'' is the one in a swimsuit, created by Romuald Iodko.&lt;ref name =canoe/&gt;

The '''International Society of Typographic Designers''' (ISTD) is a [[professional body]] run by and for [[typographers]], [[graphic designers]], and [[educators]]. The society has an international membership and its aims are to establish and maintain standards of typography and to provide a forum for debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istd.org.uk/flash_content/index.htm|title=ISTD - International Society of Typographic Designers|accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ISTD was originally formed as the British Typographers' Guild (BTG) in 1928 when [[Vincent Steer]] and friends met in a Sicilian restaurant in [[Holborn]], to found the society. Steer recognized the need and the potential for the creative typographer's skills in a world where most 'design' was carried out through compositors' layouts. From his own background in printing, and the opportunity to observe the trade in America, he determined to develop the profession of typography in the UK, and to that end started the British Typographers Guild with six other like-minded founding members.&lt;ref name=steer&gt;{{cite journal|title=Facts concerning the origins of the STD|first=Vincent|last=Steer|journal=TypoGraphic|issue=2|year=1971|publisher=Society of Typographic Designers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953 the guild became the Society of Typographic Designers (STD),&lt;ref name=steer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= The Monotype Chronicles | first = Lawrence W. | last = Wallis | url = http://www.monotypeimaging.com/aboutus/MT1926_1933.aspx | accessdate = April 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1999, recognizing its influence in other countries, and at the behest of then President [[Colin Banks]], it became the International Society of Typographic Designers (ISTD).{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

== TypoGraphic ==
''TypoGraphic'' is the journal of the ISTD and was first published in 1971. Selected writings from 30 years of ''TypoGraphic'' were published in an anthology in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TypoGraphic Writing|isbn=0-9540127-0-4|editor-first=David|editor-last=Jury|publisher=ISTD [International Society of Typographic Designers]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A complete set of ''TypoGraphic'' journals is available at the [[St Bride Library]].

== ISTD International Typographic Awards ==
The ISTD runs the International Typographic Awards which are held as an appraisal of current standards in typographic design and are judged by some of today's leading graphic, interactive and typographic design specialists:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awards.istd.org.uk/|publisher=ISTD [International Society of Typographic Designers]|title=ISTD Awards 2011| accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A Certificate of Excellence, awarded to all finalists, signifies a high standard of design in conjunction with a high standard of typography.
* Premier Awards, awarded to designers of outstanding submissions, are offered for work that has not only met the criteria for the award of a Certificate of Excellence, but which is also considered outstanding by a majority of the jurors.
* The winning submission, selected from all of the Premier Awards, is judged to be the most significant typographical achievement, exemplifying excellence.

The ISTD Awards are held every three years: there were awards in 2011 and 2014, and {{as of|2016|lc=yes}} the next award will be given during 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards|url=http://www.istd.org.uk/awards|publisher=International Society of Typographic Designers|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Categories of membership ==

The ISTD has several categories of membership,&lt;ref name=become_a_member&gt;{{cite book|title=Become a member|publisher=ISTD [International Society of Typographic Designers]|url= http://www.istd.org.uk/flash_content/pdf/istd_membership.pdf|accessdate=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; some with designatory [[postnominal]]s:

* Honorary Fellowship (HonFISTD) is awarded in recognition of outstanding typographic design work, or significant contribution to the aims of, or service to, the ISTD or the typographic industry.
* Fellowship (FISTD) is awarded in recognition of the nominee's professional standing or for their services to the ISTD.
* Membership (MISTD) is open to all practising typographers, graphic designers, and educators who show, by submission of their typographic design work, or through evidence of competence in their field of activity, that their professional ability has reached the high standard required by the ISTD.
* Student Membership is open to students who are successful in the [[#ISTD Student Assessment|Student Assessment]].
* Corporate Membership  is open to design organizations, companies, and other commercial institutions to support the ISTD.
* Institutional Membership is open to educational institutions involved in the delivery of typographic studies. This offers a range of benefits including reduced submission fees for students submitting projects for assessment and teaching materials from the ISTD education archive.

== ISTD Student Assessment ==

The annual Student Assessment, started in 1975, allows students to gain entry to the ISTD.&lt;ref name=become_a_member/&gt; This is achieved by assessment of their work applied to a rigorous brief (five new project briefs are published in October each year), and is open to those registered on a recognised full-time [[undergraduate]] or [[postgraduate]] course. Assessment is carried out by teams of practicing designers and typographic educators.

Student Assessments are held in England, Ireland, Middle East, South Africa and Australia to deal with the submissions relating to each location. These are coordinated by the ISTD Education Team under the aegis of the Education Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISTD Assessment FAQ|publisher=ISTD [International Society of Typographic Designers]|url=http://assessment.istd.org.uk/faq/|accessdate=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann Nepomuk Hoechle''' (16 September 1790, [[Munich]] - 12 December 1835, [[Vienna]]) was an Austrian painter and [[lithographer]] who specialized in scenes from military actions and current events.

== Biography ==
His father was Johann Baptist Hoechle (1754-1832), an artist from Switzerland who later became [[court painter]] for the [[Habsburgs]]. When he was still a child, he was apprenticed to the engraver and etcher, [[Ferdinand Kobell]],&lt;ref name="B"&gt;[https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/BLK%C3%96:Hoechle,_Johann_Nepomuk Brief biography] @ German WikiSource.&lt;/ref&gt; who died shortly after, in 1799. The following year, his father took him to Vienna. From 1804 to 1808, he was enrolled at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna|Academy of Fine Arts]], where he studied history painting with [[Heinrich Friedrich Füger]]&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie|12|523|523|Hoechle, Joh. Nep. d. J.|Karl Weiß|ADB:Höchle, Johann Nepomuk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and landscape painting with [[Michael Wutky]]. His later career as a battle painter probably came from the influence of the French marine and military artist, Ignace Duvivier (1758-1832), who Hoechle met while he was visiting Vienna.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;

This may be what inspired Hoechle, in 1809, to make sketches of the ongoing [[Battle of Aspern]] from a hillside near [[Heiligenstadt, Vienna|Heiligenstadt]]. He was found and arrested by French soldiers, who thought he was a spy and were going to have him shot. Luckily, he spoke French and was able to convince the commanding officer that they were mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pfarre.aspern.at/Chronik/Geschichte/hoechle.php "Wer War Hoechle?"] by Johannes Holba @ Pfarre Aspern.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:HGM Hoechle Der Übergang über die Vogesen.jpg|thumb|300px|The Crossing of the Vosges.]]
In 1814, after further studies in military art, he made more sketches at the scenes of major events, on behalf of Austrian Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], and turned them into paintings at his studio.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; His most important work from this period, and his best-known overall, depicts the crossing of the [[Vosges Mountains]], following Napoleon's defeat at the [[Battle of Leipzig]]. 

In 1819, he accompanied the Emperor's entourage to Italy, followed in 1820 by attendance at major military maneuvers in Hungary.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; That same year, he did a portrait of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and, shortly after the composer's death in 1827, made a detailed sketch of his study (where he died) in the "Schwarzspanierhaus".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beethoven-haus-bonn.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=&amp;template=dokseite_digitales_archiv_en&amp;_dokid=bi:i3645&amp;_seite=1 Beethovens Sterbezimmer] @ the [[Beethoven-Haus]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1833, he was chosen to succeed his father as court painter, but died only two years later.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

'''Jordan Wolfson''' is an American artist living and working in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]]. His art is known for addressing social commentary, violence and entertainment,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; using video and film, sculptural installation and virtual reality.

== Biography ==
Wolfson was born October 9, 1980 in New York City. He graduated from [[Rhode Island School of Design]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], in 2003 receiving his BFA in Sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jordan Wolfson Biography|url=http://www.davidzwirner.com/artists/jordan-wolfson/biography/|publisher=David Zwirner|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There his peers were artists [[Ryan Trecartin]] and [[Dan Colen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://032c.com/jordan-wolfson/|title=How Do I Feel More?

For his more recent works, Wolfson uses very different media, ranging from digital shine
 painting to animatronic sculptures and new immersive technology such as [[virtual reality]]. These costly works are often produced in collaboration with technology experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artspace.com/magazine/interviews_features/qa/jordan_wolfson_interview-52204|title=Jordan Wolfson on Transforming the "Pollution" of Pop Culture Into Art|website=Artspace|language=en|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Female Figure'' ===
Wolfson's 2014 work, ''Female Figure'' is an animatronic sculpture of a woman dressed in a negligee, thigh high vinyl boots and a green half witch mask, covered in dirt marks and scuffs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-jordan-wolfson-female-figure-broad-museum-20141223-story.html|title=Jordan Wolfson's robot-sculpture finds a home at the Broad museum|last=Times|first=Los Angeles|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure dances seductively, speaking in a male voice. Using facial recognition technology, she locks eyes with viewers through a mirror.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The work addresses the violence of objectification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spikeartmagazine.com/en/articles/jordan-wolfsons-robot-moment-terror|title=Jordan Wolfson's robot: In the Moment of Terror|date=2014-07-31|work=Spike Art Magazine|access-date=2017-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Real Violence'' ===
Wolfson's immersive 3-D VR work "Real Violence' is being exhibited as part of the 2017 [[Whitney Biennial]] and immediately became the focus of media attention due to the graphic intensity of the acts portrayed therein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamlehrer/2017/03/14/10-art-works-you-must-see-at-the-2017-whitney-biennial/#4116a3681c82|title=10 Art Works You Must See At The 2017 Whitney Biennial|last=Lehrer|first=Adam|date=2017-03-14|work=Forbes Magazine|access-date=2017-06-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wmagazine.com/story/jordan-wolfson-whitney-biennial-2017-reviews-reactions|title="The Work Is Repellant": All the Horrified Reactions to Jordan Wolfson's Ultraviolent VR Art at the Whitney Biennial|last=Eckardt|first=Stephanie|date=2017-03-15|work=W Magazine|access-date=2017-06-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2017/03/01/a-history-of-violence-jordan-wolfson-on-his-shocking-foray-into-vr-at-the-whitney-biennial/|title=A History of Violence: Jordan Wolfson on His Shocking Foray into VR at the Whitney  Biennial|last=Freeman|first=Nate|date=2017-03-01|website=ARTnews|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Real Violence" was designed to draw debate on the nature of VR as an authentic experience that the viewer has authority over.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There has also been criticism over the work "Real Violence" at the [[New Museum]] screening of the work (in 2017).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/387090/jordan-wolfson-evades-the-politics-of-his-violent-images/|title=Jordan Wolfson Evades the Politics of His Violent Images|date=2017-06-23|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2017-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate was on the role of the artist, Wolfson's responsibility in making a political statement with his art and if there is a role of privilege/power hierarchy that should have been addressed when dealing with the subject matter of violence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11824">The '''list of Dan Dare stories''' details appearances of the character [[Dan Dare]], created by [[Frank Hampson]].

==The original ''Eagle'' comic==

These are the '''Dan Dare stories''' that appeared in the original [[Eagle (comic)|Eagle Comic]], which ran from 1950 to 1969 and featured the hero [[Dan Dare]]. The stories would often take place as parts of longer story arcs, and when this happened the stories are grouped together as such.  These storylines were reprinted by Hawk Books in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and as of May, 2009, the first ten stories have been reprinted again by [[Titan Books]].  The series of twelve hardbacks, each about 100 pages, splits ''Voyage to Venus'' and ''Operation Saturn'' across two volumes each.  After a brief hiatus, the following two stories, 'Man From Nowhere' and 'Rogue Planet' were released in 2008, with ''The Phantom Fleet'' and ''Safari in Space'' continuing publication into 2009..

Three stories (''Man From Nowhere'', ''Rogue Planet'', ''Reign of the Robots'') were reproduced in the early 1980s by [[Dragon's Dream]].  The first of these books was particularly notable because the front page panel with the Eagle logo was replaced with new artwork drawn by Dan Dare's creator [[Frank Hampson]].

''This story was followed by a reprint of '''The Man From Nowhere''' (Volume 19, Number 4 to Volume 19, Number 32) and an abridged reprint of '''Rogue Planet''' (Volume 19, Number 33 to Volume 20, Number 17).''

''The original Eagle's run then came to an end when it was merged with the [[Lion (comic)|Lion Comic]].''

==2000AD==

Between 1977 and 1981 the Dan Dare character was revived to appear in the new [[2000 AD (comics)|2000AD]] comic. For the first 45 progs (issues) of the comic, "Dan Dare" was considered to be the "lead" strip, and hence held the coveted centre-spread position, thus allowing the first two pages of the strip to be printed in colour. From prog 46 to prog 58, Dare was moved to the front cover, a move that not only allowed the fan favourite [[Judge Dredd]] to take the centre spread, but which also meant that by dispensing with the traditional single-image cover, the comic could effectively have an extra page of content.

==The relaunched ''Eagle'' comic==

In 1982 Eagle was re-launched, with Dan Dare once again its flagship strip. The new character was the great-great-grandson of the original, with the only other surviving original character being the Mekon, although a descendent of Digby was later introduced.

*''Return of the Mekon'' issues 1-33

==Revolver==
In 1990, a strip entitled ''Dare'', written by [[Grant Morrison]] and drawn by [[Rian Hughes]], was serialized in ''[[Revolver Comic (UK)|Revolver]]''. It presented bleak and cynical characters and was a not-too-subtle satire of 1980s [[British politics]]. Spacefleet had been privatised, the Treens were subjected to racist abuse in urban ghettos, Digby was unemployed, Professor Peabody committed suicide, and Dare's mentor Sir Hubert Guest betrayed Dare to [[the Mekon]] and his quisling British Prime Minister, Gloria Munday (whose appearance and demeanour appear modelled on [[Margaret Thatcher]].) Ultimately, Dare destroys London, the Mekon and himself through a smuggled nuclear weapon.

==The Planet==
In 1996, ''The Planet'' published its first and only issue. Inside was a new and unfinished Dan Dare story, "Remembrance", drawn by [[Sydney Jordan]] featuring a slightly older Dare and apparently set some years after the original Eagle strips.

==Virgin Comics==
In 2008 [[Virgin Comics]] published a 7 issue Dan Dare [[mini-series]] written by [[Garth Ennis]], with art by [[Gary Erskine]]. The series is set several years after the original strips. Space Fleet has collapsed along with the UN due to nuclear war between China and America; Britain survived due to defensive shields made by Professor Peabody, and has become a world power again as a result with the [[Royal Navy]] taking Space Fleet's role. Peabody is the [[Home Secretary]] to a [[Prime Minister]] modelled on [[Tony Blair]], who has sold [[Earth]]'s defence out to [[The Mekon]] out of fear of overwhelming odds. Dare, assisted by Digby (who sacrifices himself in battle) leads a spirited defence of both Earth and his honourable principles.

'''''Lock-Up''''' is an American [[crime drama]] series that premiered in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] in September 1959 and concluded in June 1961. The half-hour episodes had little time for character development or subplots and presented a compact story without embellishment.

==Series overview==
The program stars [[Macdonald Carey]] as real-life [[Philadelphia]] corporate attorney Herbert L. Maris and [[John Doucette]] as police detective Lieutenant Jim Weston.

Each episode began with the following introduction: "These stories are based on the files and case histories of Herbert L. Maris, prominent attorney, who has devoted his life to saving the innocent."

The foundation of each episode is the cornerstone of English and American jurisprudence: a person charged with a crime is [[Presumption of innocence|innocent until proven guilty]] in a court of law. The series featured stories persons who were unjustly accused, usually due to [[circumstantial evidence]]. The program's primary theme is that when individuals are charged with a crime not all is as it first appears and a thorough investigation is duly warranted in order to uncover vital facts pertinent to the case.

Herbert L. Maris had an uncanny sense about the honest, innocent persons who had been falsely accused. He was an attorney who spent his spare time helping defendants unjustly charged by the [[State (U.S.)|
State]]. The stories do not involve federal crimes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6603">'''Luc-Marie Bayle''' (30 January 1914, [[Malo-les-Bains]] – 11 October 2000, Paris) was a French naval officer, painter, and artist.

==Career==

===Military===
Bayle began his military career in 1932 when he entered the [[École Navale]]. After promotion he sailed on various ships and conducted campaigns to China and Africa.  After attending further marine school training in [[Lorient]], Bayle completed two missions, one in 1948 the other in 1949, to [[Adélie Land]] on the ''[[USS Lancewood (AN-48)|Commandant Charcot]]'' for which he became the on-board photographer, historian, and official painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rfi.fr/radiofr/editions/073/edition_68_20090208.asp|title=De Brest en Terre Adélie|date=8 February 2009|work=[[Radio France Internationale]]|language=French|accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commanded the French Navy in [[Polynesia]] from 1956 to 1958. In 1975 he was elected to the [[Académie de Marine]].

===Museum and historical work===
In 1954 Bayle created a large model aircraft carrier on the [[Seine]] in order to demonstrate the complexity of the equipment and electronics involved. He was the director of the [[Musée national de la Marine]]&lt;ref name="mirror"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Society for Nautical Research|year=2002|title=The Mariner's mirror|volume=88|quote=The late Luc-Marie Bayle, who drew as a midshipman in France's Far Eastern fleet and became Director of the Musee de la Marine in Paris, was also a Peintre Official de la Marine}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Paris from 1972 to 1980 and created the concept of a "port-museum", especially in Port-Louis, near Lorient. He was particularly interested in historic ships such as the ''[[Duchesse Anne|Großherzogin Elisabeth]]'', a three-masted war-damaged ship which was brought back to Brest in 1946 and renamed the ''Duchesse Anne''. After serving in the Navy the ship sank into neglect. After an initial restoration project funded by the Port-Louis museum, Bayle launched a new call for the rescue of the ''Duchess Anne'' in February 1979, deeming her condition to be critical. It was ultimately [[Dunkirk]] that restored the ship in 1980/81, where it remains on display. Bayle founded the French maritime heritage preservation association "AMERAMI" in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.six-fours.net/actualite/sanary-amerami-l-argonaute-et-le-rose-helene-793.html|title=Amerami, l’Argonaute…et le Rose Hélène|date=18 March 2010|work=Six Fours.net|publisher=SFN Media|accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artistry===
Bayle drew and painted, mostly in watercolors, beginning with his first expedition to China where he developed his talent in this discipline. Other locations included in this collection are Tahiti, Moorea, Bora Bora and Mangareva, as well as the less frequented [[Île Saint-Paul]], [[Macquarie Island]], [[Kerguelen Islands]], and the [[Balleny Islands]]. His works are complemented by rag sewn [[tapestries]], posters, and advertisements. He also illustrated many books.

Bayle was appointed [[Peintre de la Marine]]&lt;ref name="mirror"/&gt; in 1944. After the war ended he received an order for a tapestry for the officers of the Rue Royale. Due to his lack of funds, the Naval police provided him with a bundle of material and a team of seamstresses to perform the work. In the 1948 mission to Adélie Land, Commander Max Jacques Henri Douguet accepted Bayle on board with the prevision that he learn how to use a film camera. During the three months of travel Bayle not only learned how to film, he also composed a tapestry commemorating the arrival of [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] to the territory in 1840. In addition to writing a diary covering the first two Adélie Land expeditions, Bayle wrote ''Le Voyage de la Nouvelle Incomprise'' recounting the same events. From 1960 to 1972, with Hervé Baille Bayle, he created a publishing company (B &amp; B). After designing the logo for the legendary ship ''[[RV Calypso|Calypso]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cousteau|first=Jacques Yves|authorlink=Jacques Cousteau|title=The living sea|year=1963|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|quote=The Calypso insigne on the title page was designed by Luc-Marie Bayle|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; he conceived and designed the crystal sword used for [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau|Jacques Cousteau]]'s official [[Académie française]] reception in 1989.

==Legacy==
On 1 January 2003, the [[Universal Postal Union]] issued a stamp in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnsstamps.ch/en/stamps/TF010.03|title=Tribute to Luc Marie Bayle|publisher=[[Universal Postal Union]]|accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an Italian [[philosopher]]. He is known for his studies of the consequences of new [[technology]] in [[art]] and [[aesthetics]], which introduced a new theoretical perspective through concepts such as the "communication aesthetics", the "technological sublime", the "communication block", and the "aesthetics of flux".

==Early life and education==
{{expand section|date=October 2011}}

==Career==
Costa has had an extensive academic career. He has been Professor of Aesthetics at the [[University of Salerno]], and has taught Methodology and History of Literary Criticism at the [[University of Naples]], and Ethics and Aesthetics of Communication at the [[University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis]]. He has authored some twenty books and numerous essays, published in Europe and America. In 1985, he founded [[Artmedia]], the Laboratory of  the Aesthetics of Media and Communication, at the University of Salerno, Department of Philosophy. As a director of Artmedia he developed an intense activity of promotion of neo-technological art, and contributed to arrange many conferences and events in Naples, Paris, Köln, Toronto, Tel Aviv and São Paulo.

===Thought===
His theoretical work followed two main paths of research: 1) the socio-political and philosophical interpretation of the 20th-century artistic [[avant-garde]], and 2) the development of a philosophy of [[Art techniques and materials|technique]], through the analysis of the changes introduced by new technology into art and aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* Following the first research path, since the 1960s, he provided philosophical and aesthetic interpretations of several avant-garde movements, in art and literature. Particularly relevant are his works on [[Marcel Duchamp]],&lt;ref&gt;Costa, Mario.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was based on notions such as the "technological sublime" and the "aesthetics of flux".

===The technological sublime===
In the early 1980s, Costa started an investigation on [[media (communication)|media]] and [[communication]] [[technologies]] whose first result was the ''aesthetics of communication'', a theory which conceptualizes the possibility of an aesthetics of [[simultaneity]] at a [[distance]]. The basic principles of this theory were stated in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;See ''News and Notes'', Report by the International Center of Aesthetic Communication, Salerno, January 1986, and Mario Costa, ''L'estetica della comunicazione'', Roma, Castelvecchi, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the 1990s, Costa defined a more general, comprehensive, aesthetic and philosophical, theory of [[new media]], which he named the ''technological [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Costa, Mario. ''Le sublime technologique'', op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; He traced the history of the sublime and of its metamorphosis: the ''rhetoric sublime'' of the ancient philosophy, the ''natural sublime'' of the 18th century, the ''industrial-metropolitan sublime'' of modernity, and finally what he considers to be the latest form of the sublime, namely the ''technological sublime''. 
He argued that the excess from which any manifestation of the sublime comes from is represented by all the new electro-[[Electronic computer|electronic]] and [[digital technology]] of [[image]], [[sound]], [[writing]], [[communication]], and spaceness. According to Costa, new technologies - which are developing as an exorbitant, self-operating technological system - imply on the one hand the weakening of the ''subject'' and the disappearance of the art and of all related categories (beauty, style, artistic personality, expression, etc.). On the other hand, new technologies are at the origin of a new aesthetic dimension, the ''technological sublime'', which is defined by new categories: the de-subjectivation of aesthetic production, the hyper-subject, and the suppression of the symbolic and the meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Costa, Mario. ''Le sublime technologique'', op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also:

* ''Paysages du sublime'', in ''Revue d'Esthetique'', 39, Paris, 2001, pp. 125&amp;ndash;133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary art and the aesthetics of flux===
According to Costa, the whole theoretical apparatus developed by traditional [[aesthetics]], from the 18th century, has become completely obsolete and useless to understand the present manifestations of art. The emerging techno-anthropological condition and its most significant aesthetic products need a new explanation and theory, in which the "form", ''i.e.'', the basic category of traditional aesthetics, is finally substituted by the category of "flux", which his analysis considers both from a philosophical point of view and in its diverse aesthetic manifestations. Costa extended his reflection from the "cinematographic flux" to the present "technological aesthetic fluxes", made possible by the advent of [[digital technology]] and [[Computer network|networks]]. He concluded that technological fluxes may also highlight essential aspects of contemporary [[ontology]], being closely tied to our experience of [[time]] and existential attitude.&lt;ref&gt;Costa, Mario.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7186">A '''media prank''' is a type of [[media event]], perpetrated by staged speeches, activities, or press releases, designed to trick legitimate journalists into publishing erroneous or misleading articles.  The term may also refer to such stories if planted by fake journalists, as well as the false story thereby published.  A media prank is a form of [[culture jamming]] generally done as [[performance art]] or a [[practical joke]] for purposes of a humorous critique of [[mass media]].

==Notable instances==
In May 1927, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], who was known as one of the fiercest pranksters at the ''[[École Normale Superieure]]''&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Boulé [https://books.google.com/books?id=wlukeHj_TKEC&amp;pg=PA53 ''Sartre, self-formation, and masculinities''] p.53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen-Solal1988p61"&gt;[[Annie Cohen-Solal|Cohen-Solal, Annie]] (1988) [https://books.google.com/books?id=vWbWlhHG-PEC ''Sartre: A Life''] pp.61-2 quote: {{quotation|During his first years at the Ecole, Sartre was the fearsome instigator of all the revues, all the jokes, all the scandals.}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized with his comrades Nizan, Larroutis, Baillou and Herland,&lt;ref&gt;Godo, Emmanuel (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=oT9lAAAAMAAJ ''Sartre en diable''] p.41&lt;/ref&gt; a media prank following [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s successful New York-Paris flight. Sartre &amp; Co. called newspapers telling them that Lindbergh would be awarded an honorary degree by the ''École''. Many newspapers including ''[[Le Petit Parisien]]'' announced the event on May 25 and thousands showed up, unaware that they were witnessing a stunt with a [[look-alike]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayman, Ronald (1987) [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCpBAQAAIAAJ ''Sartre: a life''] pp.69, 318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerassi89p76"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tameri.com/csw/exist/sartre.shtml Jean-Paul Sartre - philosopher, social advocate]&lt;/ref&gt; A scandal followed resulting in the resignation of the ''École'' director [[Gustave Lanson]].&lt;ref name="Gerassi89p76"&gt;John Gerassi (1989) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XStvJEokm7gC&amp;pg=PA76 ''Jean-Paul Sartre: Protestant or protester?''] pp.76-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yuL98MtZ5poC&amp;pg=PA26 Sartre By David Drake] p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

One well-known 1967 prank, orchestrated by [[Abbie Hoffman]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]] and chronicled in [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[Armies of the Night]]'', involved a mock gathering protesting the [[Vietnam War]] (that many media took as a serious but misguided effort) intended to [[levitate]] the [[the Pentagon|Pentagon]].&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

[[Joey Skaggs]] is one of the most prolific creators of media pranks in the United States, often using actors to stage outlandish public events that are then covered by news media as real stories.&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DF123EF930A15751C1A966958260|publisher=New York Times|title= The Merry Pranksters And the Art of the Hoax|date=1990-12-23|author=Mark Dery}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his many pranks, he convinced [[United Press International]] to report that cockroach hormones had been identified as a cure for arthritis,&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt; and tricked [[WABC-TV]] in New York city to create a news segment (which was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] despite being untrue) about a supposed "[[Brothel|cathouse]] for dogs".&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt;

The band [[Negativland]] is (according to Time Magazine) "better known for media pranks than records".  The band, as an excuse for cancelling an upcoming tour, issued a press release claiming that a teenager who had committed a multiple [[ax murder]] did so after arguing with his parents over the meaning of its song, "[[Christianity Is Stupid]]".  The story was picked up and reprinted as true by mass media, and the band wrote later songs about having perpetrated the hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=New York Times|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E3D8153BF93AA15751C1A962958260|author=Neil Strauss|date=1994-12-19|title=A Reluctant Success}}{{cite news|publisher=Boston Phoenix|url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/this_just_in/documents/04301666.asp|date=2004-12-03|title=Negativ energy:Hosler hits the road|author=Chris Dahlen|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006032023/http://bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/this_just_in/documents/04301666.asp|archivedate=2007-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003 the band issued a series of press releases accusing [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], Washington radio station [[KJR-FM]] of playing 1980s music despite claiming it only played "the best of the 60s and 70s" then, after the radio station changed its format, issued more press releases announcing that it had all been a prank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=02/09/13/5865550|title=Negativland Uses Mosquito Fleet To Bite Clear Channel and the NAB|date=2002-09-13|publisher=Infoshop news}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1999 with the fake campaign-oriented website gwbush.com, the [[Yes Men]] have impersonated famous celebrities, politicians, and business officials at appearances, interviews, websites, and other media to make political points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/a/2004/10/03/PKGTP8VSB21.DTL|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|title=Pulling Pranks on Those in Power|author=John McMurtrie|date=2004-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December, 2009 an Argentina news station fell victim to a media prank. Acting on a Facebook link, an investigative reporter believed that the latest trend in underage drinking was tied to a new cocktail mix called Grog XD. Unbeknown to the reporter, the 
recipe was from the video game ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asylum.com/2009/12/02/reporter-uncovers-the-dangers-of-monkey-island-grog-xd/ |title=Reporter Uncovers the Dangers of Drinking Grog XD |publisher=Asylum.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo; |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8274Bk8-Bt8 |title=C5N - La irresponsabilidad de un noticiero |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-08-29 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
Although media pranks may serve as legitimate criticism of the press, and artistic creations in their own right, they are often criticized not only for the disruption they cause but as simple [[publicity stunt]]s that take advantage of the very failures of mass media that they ostensibly oppose.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt;  Skaggs has criticized the [[Flash mob]] movement, as being frivolous and lacking the [[counterculture|countercultural]] element of more serious protest art.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122119092302626987?mod=googlenews_wsj|date=2008-09-12|title=The New Pranksters|author=Ellen Gamerman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medieval theatre''' refers to [[theatre|theatrical performance]] in the period between the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century A.D. and the beginning of the [[Renaissance]] in approximately the 15th century A.D. Medieval Theatre covers all drama produced in Europe over that thousand-year period and refers to a variety of genres, including [[liturgical drama]], [[mystery plays]], [[morality plays]], [[farce]]s and [[masque]]s. Beginning with [[Hrosvitha]] of Gandersheim in the 10th century, Medieval drama was for the most part very religious and moral in its themes, staging and traditions. The most famous examples of Medieval plays are the English cycle dramas, the [[York Mystery Plays]], the [[Chester Mystery Plays]], the [[Wakefield Mystery Plays]] and the [[N-Town Plays]], as well as the [[morality play]], ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]''. One of the earliest surviving secular plays in English is ''[[The Interlude of the Student and the Girl]]'' (c. 1300).

Due to a lack of surviving records and texts, a low literacy rate of the general population, and the opposition of the clergy to some types of performance, there are few surviving sources on Medieval drama of the [[Early Middle Ages|Early]] and [[High Middle Ages|High]] Medieval periods. However, by the [[Late Middle Ages|late]] period, [[drama]] and [[theatre]] began to become more secularized and a larger number of records survive documenting [[play (theatre)|plays]] and performances.

==Early Medieval theatre==
[[File:Roswitha of Gandersheim.jpg|left|200px|thumb|[[Hrosvitha]] of Gandersheim, the first dramatist of the post-classical era.]]
Faced with the problem of explaining a new religion to a largely illiterate population, churches in the [[Early Middle Ages]] began staging dramatized versions of particular biblical events on specific days of the year. These dramatizations were included in order to vivify annual celebrations.&lt;ref name="Brockett_76"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 76)&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic objects and actions ([[vestments]], [[altar]]s, [[censer]]s, and [[pantomime]] performed by priests) recalled the events which Christian ritual celebrates. These were extensive sets of visual signs that could be used to communicate with a largely illiterate audience. These performances developed into [[liturgical drama]]s, the earliest of which is the ''Whom do you Seek (Quem-Quaeritis)'' Easter trope, dating from ca. 925.&lt;ref name="Brockett_76"/&gt; Liturgical drama was sung responsively by two groups and did not involve actors impersonating characters. However, sometime between 965 and 975, [[Æthelwold of Winchester]] composed the ''Regularis Concordia (Monastic Agreement)'' which contains a playlet complete with directions for performance.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,77"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 77)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition from Rome, 500-900 A.D.==
As the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell into severe decay through the 4th and 5th centuries A.D., the seat of Roman power shifted to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], later called the [[Byzantine Empire]]. While surviving evidence about Byzantine theatre is slight, existing records show that [[mime]], [[pantomime]], scenes or recitations from [[tragedy|tragedies]] and [[comedy|comedies]], [[dance]]s, and other entertainments were very popular. Constantinople had two theatres that were in use as late as the 5th century A.D. However, the true importance of the Byzantines in theatrical history is their preservation of many classical Greek texts and the compilation of a massive encyclopedia called the [[Suda]], from which is derived a large amount of contemporary information on Greek theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 70)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 6th century, the Emperor [[Justinian]] finally closed down all theatres for good.

According to the [[binary opposition|binary]] thinking of the Church's early followers, everything that did not belong to [[God]] belonged to the [[Devil]]; thus all non-Christian gods and [[Paganism|religions]] were [[satanism|satanic]]. Efforts were made in many countries through this period to not only convert [[Jews]] and [[paganism|pagans]] but to destroy pre-Christian institutions and influences. Works of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] literature were burnt, the thousand-year-old [[Platonic Academy]] was closed, the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] were banned and all theatres were shut down. The theatre itself was viewed as a diabolical threat to [[Christianity]] because of its continued popularity in [[Rome]] even among new converts. Church fathers such as [[Tatian]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Augustine]] characterized the stage as an instrument in the Devil's fiendish plot to corrupt men's souls, while [[acting]] was considered [[sin]]ful because of its cruel mockery of God's creation.&lt;ref name="Wise_Walker,184"&gt;Wise and Walker (2003, 184)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under these influences, the [[Christian Church|church]] set about trying to suppress theatrical spectacles by passing laws prohibiting and excluding [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[actors]]. They were forbidden to have contact with Christian women, own [[slavery|slaves]], or wear [[gold]]. They were officially [[excommunicated]], denied the [[sacraments]], including [[marriage]] and [[burial]], and were defamed and debased throughout [[Europe]]. For many centuries thereafter, clerics were cautioned to not allow these suddenly homeless, travelling actors to perform in their jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Wise_Walker,184"/&gt;

From the 5th century, [[Western Europe]] was plunged into a period of general disorder that lasted (with a brief period of stability under the [[Carolingian Empire]] in the 9th century) until the 10th century A.D. As such, most organized theatrical activities disappeared in [[Western Europe]]. While it seems that small nomadic bands traveled around Europe throughout the period, performing wherever they could find an audience, there is no evidence that they produced anything but crude scenes .&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 75)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hrosvitha]] (c.935-973), an aristocratic canoness and historian in northern [[Germany]], wrote six plays modeled on [[Terence]]'s comedies but using religious subjects in the 10th century A.D. Terence's comedies had long been used in [[monastery]] schools as examples of spoken [[Latin]] but are full of clever, alluring [[courtesans]] and ordinary human pursuits such as [[sex]], [[love]] and [[marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;McAlister, Linda. "Hypatia's Daughters: 1500 Years of Women Philosophers." Hypatia Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to preempt criticism from the [[Christian Church|church]], Hrosvitha prefaced her collection by stating that her moral purpose to save Christians from the guilt they must feel when reading Classical literature. Her declared solution was to imitate the "laudable" deeds of women in Terence's plays and discard the "shameless" ones.&lt;ref&gt;Wise and Walker (2003, 190)&lt;/ref&gt; These six plays are the first known plays composed by a female dramatist and the first identifiable Western dramatic works of the post-Classical era.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,77"/&gt; They were first published in 1501 and had considerable influence on religious and didactic plays of the sixteenth century. Hrosvitha was followed by [[Hildegard of Bingen]] (d. 1179), a [[Benedictine]] abbess, who wrote a [[Latin]] [[music]]al drama called ''Ordo Virtutum'' in 1155.

The anonymous pagan play ''[[Querolus]]'', written c.420, was adapted in the 12th century by Vitalis of Blois.  Other secular Latin plays were also written in the 12th century, mainly in France but also in England (''[[Babio]]'').  There certainly existed some other performances that were not fully fledged theatre; they may have been carryovers from the original pagan cultures (as is known from records written by the clergy disapproving of such festivals). It is also known that mimes, minstrels, bards, storytellers, and jugglers traveled in search of new audiences and financial support. Not much is known about these performers' repertoire and few written texts survive. One of the most famous of the secular plays is the musical ''[[Jeu de Robin et Marion|Le Jeu de Robin et Marion]]'', written by [[Adam de la Halle]] in the 13th century, which is fully laid out in the original manuscript with lines, musical notation, and illuminations in the margins depicting the actors in motion.  Adam also wrote another secular play, ''Jeu de la Fueillee'' in [[Arras]], a French town in which theatre was thriving in the late 12th and 13th centuries. One play surviving from Arras, is ''Jeu de saint Nicolas'' by [[Jean Bodel]] (c.1200).

==High and Late Medieval theatre==
[[File:Castle of Perseverance staging.jpg|thumb|right|305px|Stage drawing from 15th-century [[vernacular]] [[morality play]] ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]'' (as found in the [[Macro Manuscript]]).]]
As the [[Viking]] invasions ceased in the middle of the 11th century A.D., [[liturgical drama]] had spread from [[Russia]] to [[Scandinavia]] to [[Italy]]. Only in [[Al-Andalus|Muslim-occupied Spain]] were liturgical dramas not presented at all. Despite the large number of liturgical dramas that have survived from the period, many churches would have only performed one or two per year and a larger number never performed any at all.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 78)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Feast of Fools]] was especially important in the development of comedy. The festival inverted the status of the lesser clergy and allowed them to ridicule their superiors and the routine of church life. Sometimes plays were staged as part of the occasion and a certain amount of [[burlesque]] and [[comedy]] may have entered the liturgical drama as a result of its influence.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 80).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Performance of religious plays outside of the church began sometime in the 12th century through a traditionally accepted process of merging shorter liturgical dramas into longer plays which were then translated into [[vernacular]] and performed by laymen and thus accessible to a wider segment of society inclusive of the working class. The use of vernacular enabled drama to be understood and enjoyed by a larger audience.  ''The Mystery of Adam'' (1150) gives credence to this theory as its detailed stage direction suggest that it was staged outdoors. A number of other plays from the period survive, including ''La Seinte Resurrection'' ([[Normans|Norman]]), ''The Play of the Magi Kings'' ([[Spain|Spanish]]), and ''Sponsus'' ([[France|French]]).

Economic and political changes in the [[High Middle Ages]] led to the formation of  [[guilds]] and the growth of towns, and this would lead to significant changes for theatre starting in this time and continuing into in the [[Late Middle Ages]]. Trade guilds began to perform plays, usually religiously based, and often dealing with a biblical story that referenced their profession. For instance, a baker's guild would perform a reenactment of the [[Last Supper]].&lt;ref&gt;A History of English literature for Students, by Robert Huntington Fletcher, 1916: pp. 85-88&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[British Isles]], plays were produced in some 127 different towns during the Middle Ages. These vernacular "[[mystery plays]]" were written in cycles of a large number of plays: [[York Mystery Plays|York]] (48 plays), [[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester]] (24), [[Wakefield Mystery Plays|Wakefield]] (32) and [[N-Town Plays|Unknown]] (42). A larger number of plays survive from [[France]] and [[Germany]] in this period and some type of religious dramas were performed in nearly every European country in the [[Late Middle Ages]]. Many of these plays contained [[comedy]], [[devil]]s, [[villain]]s and [[clown]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 86)&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of actors in these plays were drawn from the local population. For example, at [[Valenciennes]] in 1547, more than 100 roles were assigned to 72 actors.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 95)&lt;/ref&gt; Plays were staged on [[pageant wagon]] stages, which were platforms mounted on wheels used to move scenery. Often providing their own costumes, amateur performers in England were exclusively male, but other countries had female performers. The platform stage, which was an unidentified space and not a specific locale, allowed for abrupt changes in location.

[[Morality plays]] emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished until 1550. ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]'' which depicts [[Human|mankind]]'s progress from birth to death. Though ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]'' may possibly be the best known of this genre, it is atypical in many ways. Everyman receives [[Death]]'s summons, struggles to escape and finally resigns himself to necessity. Along the way, he is deserted by [[Kinship|Kindred]], [[Good (economics)|Goods]], and [[Fellow]]ship - only [[Good works|Good Deeds]] goes with him to the grave.

Secular drama was also staged throughout the Middle Ages, the earliest of which is ''The Play of the Greenwood'' by [[Adam de la Halle]] in 1276. It contains satirical scenes and [[Folklore|folk]] material such as [[faeries]] and other supernatural occurrences. [[Farce]]s also rose dramatically in popularity after the 13th century. The majority of these plays come from [[France]] and [[Germany]] and are similar in tone and form, emphasizing [[sex]] and bodily excretions.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 96)&lt;/ref&gt; The best known playwright of farces is [[Hans Sachs]] (1494–1576) who wrote 198 dramatic works. In England, ''[[The Second Shepherds' Play]]'' of the ''[[Wakefield Cycle]]'' is the best known early farce. However, farce did not appear independently in England until the 16th century with the work of [[John Heywood]] (1497–1580).

A significant forerunner of the development of [[Elizabethan]] drama was the [[Chamber of rhetoric|Chambers of Rhetoric]] in the [[Low Countries]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 99)&lt;/ref&gt; These societies were concerned with [[poetry]], [[music]] and [[drama]] and held contests to see which society could compose the best drama in relation to a question posed.

At the end of the [[Late Middle Ages]], professional actors began to appear in [[England]] and [[Europe]]. [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] and [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] both maintained small companies of professional actors. Their plays were performed in the [[great hall]] of a nobleman's residence, often with a raised platform at one end for the audience and a "screen" at the other for the actors. Also important were [[Mummers Play|Mummers' plays]], performed during the [[Christmas]] season, and court [[masque]]s. These masques were especially popular during the reign of [[Henry VIII]] who had a house of revels built and an [[Master of the Revels|office of revels]] established in 1545.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 101-103)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staging==
[[File:Valenciennes-stage-bnf-ms-fr-12536-f1v-2.jpg|right|thumb|320px|The [[Valenciennes]] [[Passion Play]]]]
Depending on the area of the performances, the plays were performed in the middle of the street, on [[pageant wagon]]s in the streets of great cities (this was inconvenient for the actors because the small stage size made stage movement impossible), in the halls of [[nobility]], or [[in the round]] in amphitheatres, as suggested by current archaeology in Cornwall and the southwest of England. The most detailed illustration of a mystery play stage design is the frontispiece to [[Hubert Cailleau]]'s ''The Passion and Resurrection of the Savior''. All medieval stage production was temporary and expected to be removed upon the completion of the performances. Actors, predominantly male, typically wore long, dark robes. Medieval plays such as the Wakefield cycle, or the Digby Magdalene featured lively interplay between  two distinct areas, the wider spaces in front of the raised staging areas, and the elevated areas themselves (called, respectively, the locus and the platea).&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, ''Cambridge Introduction to Early English Theatre'' (Cambridge: CUP, 2006), pp4-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically too, actors would move between these locations in order to suggest scene changes, rather than remain stationary and have the scene change around them as is typically done in modern theatres.
 
Scenery, stage machinery and costumes enabled a more realistic depiction of the message the play was trying to promote. Whether on a fixed stage, with more opportunity for spectacle, or on a pageant wagon that moved through the streets, the ornate details and tricks attributed to these productions enhanced the audience’s experience of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Styan, J.L.,"The English Stage: A History of Drama and Performance"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes during Late Middle Ages==
Changing political and economic factors greatly affected theatre at the end of the Middle Ages and beginning of the [[Modern Era]]. First, the Protestant Reformation targeted the theatre, especially in England, in an effort to stamp out allegiance to Rome. In [[Wakefield]], for example, the local mystery cycle text shows signs of Protestant editing, with references to the [[pope]] crossed out and two plays completely eliminated because they were too Catholic. However, it was not just the Protestants who attacked the theatre of the time. The [[Council of Trent]] banned religious plays in an attempt to rein in the extrabiblical material that the Protestants frequently lampooned.

A revival of interest in [[culture of ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] and [[culture of Greece|Greek culture]] changed the tastes of the learned classes in the performing arts. [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[theatre of ancient Rome|Roman]] plays were performed and new plays were written that were heavily influenced by the classical style. This led to the creation of [[Commedia dell'arte]] and influenced [[History of theatre#Renaissance theatre|Renaissance theatre]].

A change of patronage also caused drastic changes to the theatre. In England the monarch and nobility started to support professional theatre troupes (including [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] and [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]), which catered to their upper class patrons' tastes.

Finally, the construction of permanent theaters, such as [[The Theatre]] signaled a major turning point. Permanent theaters allowed for more sophisticated staging and storytelling. 

==Contributions to modern theatre==

Many components of theatre that developed during the Middle Ages continue to be incorporated in productions around the world to this day, such as use of the vernacular, spectacle, stage direction and the use of farce. Performances that were spoken in the vernacular provided opportunities for larger audiences, who included members of lower socio-economic status, who would have otherwise been excluded from understanding the performances.&lt;ref&gt;Symes, Carol. ''A Common Stage:  Theatre and Public Life in Medieval Arras.'' Cornell University Press, 10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval theatre differed from the classical theatre for it emphasized spectacle. In addition, it presented various actions on stage in time and space and presented a combination of the sublime with detailed realism. Approximately 1400 A.D., the dramas were performed with spectacle; no longer dependent exclusively on the spoken word, but incorporating music, dance, costume and set design.  The spectacle of the later Medieval theatre made it necessary to have detailed stage directions.  A sample of documented staging drawings and directions remain from the 15th-century morality play ''The Castle of Perseverance''.  The evolution to the dependence on detailed stage direction made possible the great Shakespearean stage.&lt;ref&gt;Styan, J.L. 1996. "The English Stage: A History of Drama and Performance." Cambridge University Press,1-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern productions of Medieval theatre==
===Mummers plays===
Mummers plays are still performed regularly throughout the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Hannant (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; What relation they may bear to their medieval antecedents is unknown. The surviving texts of this oral tradition were recorded in the 18th century, at a time when the [[industrial revolution]] began to break up the rural communities in which the plays were performed.

===Mystery plays===
Mystery Plays are still produced regularly throughout the [[United Kingdom]]. The local cycles were revived in both [[York]] and [[Chester]] in 1951 as part of the [[Festival of Britain]], and are still performed by the local guilds.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, Margaret. [http://www.yorkmysteryplays.co.uk/the-plays-and-the-guilds/ The Plays and the Guilds], ''York Mystery Plays''&lt;/ref&gt; The N-Town cycle was revived in 1978 as the [[Lincoln mystery plays]],

In 1977 the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] commissioned [[Tony Harrison]] to create ''[[The Mysteries (play)|The Mysteries]]'', a re-working of the [[Wakefield Cycle]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodsworth|first=Martin|date=9 January 1986|title=A poet in the land of as if|journal=[[The Guardian]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revived in 1985 (whereupon the production was filmed for [[Channel 4|Channel 4 Television]]), and again as a part of the theatre's millennium celebration in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Harrison |first=Tony |authorlink= |title=The Mysteries |year=1985 |publisher=Faber |location=London |isbn=0-571-13790-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The productions won [[Bill Bryden]] the "Best Director" title in both the [[Evening Standard Awards|Evening Standard Theatre Awards]] and the [[Olivier Awards]] for 1985, the year the three plays first appeared together in performance at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]]. An adaptation of Harrison's play was staged at [[Shakespeare's Globe]] in 2011 as ''The Globe Mysteries''.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare's Globe. [http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/discovery-space/previous-productions/the-globe-mysteries The Globe Mysteries]. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2001, the Isango Ensemble produced an African version of the Chester Cycle at the [[Garrick Theatre]] in London as ''The Mysteries – Yiimimangaliso'', performing in a combination of the [[Xhosa language]], the [[Zulu language]], English, [[Latin]] and [[Afrikaans]]. They revived an adapted version of the production at Shakespeare's Globe in 2015 as ''The Mysteries''.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare's Globe. [http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/theatre/whats-on/concerts-by-candlelight/isango-ensemble-mysteries The Isango Ensemble Mysteries] 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, two mystery plays (one focusing on the Creation and the other on the Passion) were performed at Canterbury Cathedral, with actor [[Edward Woodward]] in the role of God. The large cast also included [[Daniel MacPherson]], [[Thomas James Longley]] and [[Joseph McManners]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC News.

===Morality plays===
The first modern stage production of ''[[Everyman (modern play)|Everyman]]'' did not appear until July 1901, when The [[Elizabethan Stage Society]] of [[William Poel]] gave three outdoor performances at the [[Charterhouse Square|Charterhouse]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehler, Stephen G., (2008), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tt1iRQrIhkYC Concealing God: The "Everyman" revival, 1901–1903],'' Tufts University (PhD. thesis), 104 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Poel then partnered with British actor [[Ben Greet]] to produce the play throughout Britain, with runs on the American [[Broadway theatre|Broadway stage]] from 1902 to 1918,&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB show|id=3393|title=Everyman (Broadway play)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concurrent tours throughout North America. These productions differed from past performances in that women were cast in the title role, rather than men. Film adaptations of the 1901 version of the play appeared in 1913 and 1914, with the 1913 film being presented with an early color two-process pioneered by [[Kinemacolor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1487900}} – 1913 film version.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|2466812}} – 1914 film version.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another well-known version of the play is ''[[Jedermann (play)|Jedermann]]'' by the [[Austria]]n playwright [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]], which has been performed annually at the [[Salzburg Festival]] since 1920.{{sfn|Banham|1998|page=491}} The Hofmannsthal play was made into [[Jedermann (film)|a film of the same title]] in 1961. [[Frederick Franck]] published a modernised version of the tale entitled "Everyone", drawing on Buddhist influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitm.info/history/Groningen/mateer.htm|title=Everyman’s God|work=sitm.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; A direct-to-video movie version of ''Everyman'' was made in 2002, directed by John Farrell, which updated the setting to the early 21st century, including Death as a businessman in dark glasses with a briefcase, and Goods being played by a talking personal computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360551/|title=Everyman (2002)|date=17 July 2002|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modernized adaptation by [[Carol Ann Duffy]], the Poet Laureate, with [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] in the title role, was performed at the [[National Theatre (UK)]] from April to July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05spk34|title=BBC Radio 4 - Saturday Review, Everyman, Far from the Madding Crowd, Empire, Anne Enright, Christopher Williams|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miracle plays===
Performances of plays outside of churches are frequent during the Christmas season with reenactments of the Nativity, and many Christian schools and Sunday school groups regularly performs scenes from the bible with children. The reenactment of the Passion of Christ is performed throughout the world in the late Lenten season.

'''Mexican featherwork''', also called "plumería", was an important artistic and decorative technique in the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Hispanic]] and colonial periods in what is now [[Mexico]]. Although feathers have been prized and feather works created in other parts of the world, those done by the ''amanteca'' or feather work specialists impressed Spanish conquerors, leading to a creative exchange with Europe. [[Featherwork]] pieces took on European motifs in Mexico. Feathers and feather works became prized in Europe. The "golden age" for this technique as an art form was from just before the Spanish conquest to about a century afterwards. At the beginning of the 17th century, it began a decline due to the death of the old masters, the disappearance of the birds that provide fine feathers and the depreciation of indigenous handiwork. Feather work, especially the creation of "mosaics" or "paintings" principally of religious images remained noted by Europeans until the 19th century, but by the 20th century, the little that remained had become a handcraft, despite efforts to revive it. Today, the most common feather objects are those made for traditional dance costumes, although mosaics are made in the state of [[Michoacán]], and feather trimmed [[huipil]]s are made in the state of [[Chiapas]].

==Mesoamerican featherwork==

The use of feather for decorative purposes has been documented in many parts of the world in the past. In the [[New World]], it is known to have had ceremonial use and ranking purposes, especially in attire in what are now [[Brazil]] and [[Peru]].&lt;ref name=tcastello18&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hmeneses22&gt;Meneses, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mesoamerica]], their use became highly developed with some of the most intricate examples coming from what is now [[Mexican Plateau|central Mexico]].&lt;ref name=tcastello17&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this was their symbolic and religious use.&lt;ref name=hmeneses19&gt;Meneses, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of this symbolism arose with the spread of the worship of the [[Toltec]] god/king [[Quetzalcoatl]], depicted as a serpent covered in [[quetzal]] feathers. Quetzalcoatl was said to have discovered gold, silver and precious stones. When he fled [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]], he released all kind of birds he was breeding.&lt;ref name=tcastello17&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello33&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The Aztec main god, [[Huitzilopochtli]], is associated with the [[hummingbird]]. His origin is from ball of fine feathers that fell on his mother, [[Coatlicue]], and impregnated her. He was born fully armed with an eagle feather shield, fine plumage in his head and on his left sandal.&lt;ref name=arusso3&gt;Russo, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Feathers were valued similarly to [[jade]] and [[turquoise]] in Mesoamerica. They were considered to have magical properties as symbols of fertility, abundance, riches and power and those who used them were associated with divine powers.&lt;ref name=tcastello27&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of use goes back at least as far as the [[Mayan peoples|Mayas]], with depictions of them on the murals at [[Bonampak]]. The Mayans also raised birds in part for feathers.&lt;ref name=tcastello82&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello19&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Toltec groups were making feathered items from black and white feathers of local origin.&lt;ref name=tcastello33/&gt; The most developed use of feathers in Mesoamerica was among the [[Aztec]]s, [[Tlaxcaltec]]s and [[Purépecha people|Purepecha]].&lt;ref name=tcastello18/&gt; Feathers were used to make many types of objects from arrows, fly whisks, fans, complicated headdresses and fine clothing.&lt;ref name=tcastello238&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; By the reign of the Aztec ruler [[Ahuizotl]], richer feathers from tropical areas came to the [[Aztec Empire]] with quetzal and the finest feathers used by [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma's]] reign.&lt;ref name=tcastello33/&gt; Feathers were used for ceremonial shields, and the garments of Aztec eagle warriors were completely covered in feathers. Feather work dressed idols and priests as well.&lt;ref name=tcastello20&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Moctezuma asked the Purépecha for help against the Spanish by sending gifts that included quetzal feathers. Among the Purépecha, feathers were used similarly, for ceremonial shields, bucklers, doublets for the cazonci or ruler and feather ceremonial garments for priests, warriors and generals. To declare war, the Purépecha showed enemies wood covered in feathers and send highly prized green feathers to allies and potential allies. Soldiers who died in war were buried with feathers.&lt;ref name=tcastello143&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello81&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Codex Mendoza folio 67r bottom.jpg|thumb|Aztec warriors with feathered shields and other gear from the Mendoza Codex]]
Feathers from local and faraway sources were used, especially in the Aztec Empire. The feathers were obtained from wild birds as well as from domesticated turkeys and ducks, with the finest feathers coming from Chiapas, [[Guatemala]] and [[Honduras]] .&lt;ref name=tcastello2735&gt;Castello Yturbide, pp. 27, 35&lt;/ref&gt; These feathers were obtained through trade and tribute.&lt;ref name=tcastello35&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Feathers functioned as a kind of currency along with cocoa beans, and were a popular trade item because of their value and ease of transport over long distances and a close relationship developed between traders and feather workers.&lt;ref name=tcastello3336&gt;Castello Yturbide, pp. 33&amp;ndash;36&lt;/ref&gt; Certain areas were required to pay tribute in raw feathers and other in finished feather goods, but no area was required to provide both.&lt;ref name=tcastello65&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cuetzalan]] paid tribute to Moctezuma in the form of quetzal feathers. This demand was so great that it led to the local extinction of quetzals in that region, leaving only the name of a local tree, ''quetzalcuahuitl'', where the birds used to hide to eat.&lt;ref name=tcastello195196&gt;Castello Yturbide, pp. 196&amp;ndash;196&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important of feathers in central Mexico were the long green feathers of the [[resplendent quetzal]] which were reserved for deities and the emperor.&lt;ref name=tcastello35/&gt; One reason for their rarity was that quetzals could not be domesticated as they died in captivity. Instead wild birds were caught, plucked and released.&lt;ref name=tcastello28&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Other tropical birds were used as well. [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] made a list of the species used for fine feathers, many of which are now either [[threatened species|threatened]] or locally extinct. These include the [[mountain trogon]], [[lovely cotinga]], [[roseate spoonbill]], [[squirrel cuckoo]], [[red-legged honeycreeper]], [[emerald toucanet]], [[agami heron]], [[russet-crowned motmot]], [[turquoise-browed motmot]], [[blue grosbeak]], [[golden eagle]], [[great egret]], [[military macaw]], [[scarlet macaw]], [[yellow-headed amazon]], [[Montezuma oropendola]] and the over 53 species of hummingbird found in Mexico.&lt;ref name=tcastello207&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello235&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The_Florentine_Codex-_Aztec_Feather_Painters_IV.tiff|thumb|right|Skilled feather workers (''amanteca''). [[Florentine Codex]], Book IV.]]
In Aztec society, the class that created feather objects was called the amanteca, named after the Amantla neighborhood in [[Tenochtitlan]] where they lived and worked.&lt;ref name=tcastello19/&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello14&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The amanteca had their own god, [[Coyotlinahual]], who had companions called [[Tizaua]], [[Mamiocelotl]] and [[Mamiltochtli]]. They also honored the female deities [[Xiuhtlati]] and [[Xilo]].&lt;ref name=tcastello56&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hmeneses18&gt;Meneses, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  Daughters of amanteca generally became embroiderers and feather dyers, with the boys dedicated to the making of feather objects.&lt;ref name=tcastello56/&gt; The amanteca were a privileged class of craftsmen. They did not pay tribute nor were required to perform public service. They had a fair amount of autonomy in how they ran their businesses. Feather work was so highly prized that even sons of nobility learned something of it during their education.&lt;ref name=tcastello57&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The sophistication of this art can be seen in pieces created before the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]], some of which are part of the collection of the [[Museum of Ethnology, Vienna|Museum of Ethnology in Vienna]], such as [[Montezuma's headdress]], the ceremonial coat of arms and the great fan or fly whisk. Other important examples such as shields are in museums in Mexico City.&lt;ref name=tcastello19/&gt;
[[File:YoungWeaversCCEMEX15.JPG|thumb|left|Close up of a cloth woven in cotton and feathers at the Centro Cultural de España en México in Mexico City]]
The [[Florentine Codex]] gives information about how feather works were created. The amantecas had two ways of creating their works. One was to secure the feathers in place using [[agave]] cord for three-dimensional objects such as fly whisks, fans, bracelets, headgear and other objects. The second and more difficult was a mosaic type technique, which the Spanish also called "feather painting." These were done principally on feather shields and cloaks for idols.&lt;ref name=arusso25&gt;Russo, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello70&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;  Feather mosaics were arrangements of minute fragments of feathers from a wide variety of birds, generally worked on a paper base, made from cotton and paste, then itself backed with [[amate]] paper, but bases of other types of paper and directly on amate were done as well.&lt;ref name=arusso5&gt;Russo, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello202&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;   These works were done in layers with "common" feathers, dyed feathers and precious feathers. First a model was made with lower quality feathers and the precious feathers found only on the top layer.&lt;ref name=arusso25/&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello202/&gt; The adhesive for the feathers in the Mesoamerican period was made from orchid bulbs.&lt;ref name=tcastello202/&gt;
[[File:Huipil-de-la-malinche.jpg|thumb|The Huipil of La Malinche with feathered thread borders]]
Sometimes feathers were dyed, and sometimes fine lines or dots were painted on the feathers themselves.&lt;ref name=tcastello203&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; In some of the most precious of Aztec art, feathers were combined with gold and precious stones.&lt;ref name=arusso27&gt;Russo, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Feather art needs to be protected from light, which fades the colors and from insects that eat them. Preservatives were made with several kinds of plants, but today commercial insecticides are used.&lt;ref name=tcastello202203&gt;Castello Yturbide, pp. 202&amp;ndash;203&lt;/ref&gt;

One other way to use feathers was the creation of garments either decorated with feathers or with thread which was created by spinning cotton and feather shreds. The garments of eagle warriors were completely covered in feathers. Fabric made of the latter was favored by the nobility, both men and women which distinguished them from commoners.&lt;ref name=hmeneses19/&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello20/&gt; Little is known how feathers were incorporated into fabric in the Mesoamerican period.&lt;ref name=tcastello77&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; The only vestige of this practice is the making of wedding huipils in the town of [[Zinacantán]] in Chiapas. Although research has shown this practice is descended from the Mesoamerican one, it is still different. The Mesoamerican feathered cloth was made with thread made of cotton fiber and feathers done on a backstrap loom, which the current wedding huipils incorporate feathers into commercially spun cotton thread.&lt;ref name=arusso25/&gt;&lt;ref name=hmeneses88&gt;Meneses, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==European discovery of featherwork==
When the Spanish arrived to Mexico, they were impressed with the bird species of the land and the use of feather, with [[Hernán Cortés]] receiving among his gifts feathers from Moctezuma.&lt;ref name=tcastello20/&gt; As early as 1519, Cortés sent feathered shields, head adornments,  and fans to Spain. In 1524, Diego de Soto returned to Spain from the New World. Among the gifts for [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles V]] was artwork, including that made with feathers, such as shields with scenes of sacrifice, serpents, butterflies, birds and crests. In 1527, Cortés sent thirty eight pieces of what are identified as feather work to Asia.&lt;ref name=arusso5/&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello11&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Conquest, the art of working with feathers survived, but on a lesser scale and its uses changed.&lt;ref name=tcastello82/&gt; pagan  ritual use ended with Christian evangelization, with some surviving works conveying Christian religious themes. Featherwork's use in war also remained. One type of feather work to remains strong was the creation of mosaics, many of which were created and sent to Europe, Guatemala and Peru.&lt;ref name=tcastello40&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; They were even sent as far as Asia as gifts but little is known of this trade.&lt;ref name=tcastello104&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Exotic feathers themselves were exported to Europe and used to adorn hats, horses and clothing.&lt;ref name=tcastello40&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of feather work and the impression it made on the Spanish is documented by Spaniards such as Hernán Cortés, [[Francisco de Aguilar (conquistador)|Francisco de Aguilar]], [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]], [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés]], [[Francisco López de Gómara]], [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera|Peter Martyr]], Fray [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] and [[Andrés de Tapia Motelchiuh|Andres de Tapia]] .&lt;ref name=tcastello12&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Feathers add chromatic and luminous feathers difficult to create with paints, although oil painting at the time had well developed techniques to play with light.&lt;ref name=arusso27/&gt; Mexican expertise was valued as well.  Even though there was feather art also made in Asia, it was not as valued in the 16th and 17th century as that from Mexico.&lt;ref name=tcastello103&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Featherwork with Christian themes==
[[File:Juan Bautista Cuiris - Portrait of Christ Made of Humming Bird and Parrot Feathers - WGA05815.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Christ made of humming bird and parrot feathers by Juan Bautista Cuiris|270x270px]]
Feather work and the conquest led to a creative exchange from the conquest to about 1800.&lt;ref name=arusso6&gt;Russo, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Evangelism added Christian themes to feather work, including the making of ritual items.&lt;ref name=tcastello12/&gt; Amantecas were creating Christian religious images within months after the arrival of the conquistadors, destined for Europe as well as Asia.&lt;ref name=arusso5/&gt; The first known Christian-inspired pictures in feather work were made for banners, on a cotton cloth with an [[imprimatur]], on which the design was made. They had a backing of very fine palm or rush mats bound with twine or vegetable [[liana]]s.&lt;ref name=tcastello202/&gt; The [[Huejotzingo Codex]] depicts the making of a feather and gold banner, the first indication of feather work with Christian images.&lt;ref name=tcastello186&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, feather work was suppressed by the Spanish as part of their efforts to eradicate the old religion.  However, they soon changed tactics and employed the feather workers to create Christian images. These new works are called "feather mosaics" because of the small pieces of feathers used, and most are in the Baroque style then favored, as the artists copied images brought from Spain.&lt;ref name=tcastello21&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; After the Conquest, hummingbird feathers were used to adorn images of Christ in Michoacan, such as agave yarn sandals in hummingbird feathers made in [[Tzintzuntzan, Michoacán|Tzintzuntzan]].&lt;ref name=tcastello202/&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello145&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Indian craftsmen made and offered crosses and candlesticks adorned with green feathers called quezalli.&lt;ref name=tcastello175&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Small scale feather images and pendants serving as protective amulets were also made.&lt;ref name=arusso17&gt;Russo, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th century mosaics were made with different sized feathers combined with paper strips. Over the years, the feathers became smaller, the compositions more harmonious and the designs more subtle with the additions of gold leaf, gold foil and colored brushwork. The basic imagery was European but the edging shows traces of pre Hispanic designs.&lt;ref name=tcastello207208&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 207-208&lt;/ref&gt; The iconography of feather art images focused on founders and patron saints, along with figures related to the various religious orders. These always followed the recommendations of the [[Council of Trent]] and often to the dominant style.&lt;ref name=tcastello125&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Feathered religious items were sent to Europe, including to several popes in Rome. A number of these were re-gifted to other nobles and for this reason can be found in various museums in various parts of Europe.&lt;ref name=tcastello2122&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; Feather work became a popular item in the collection of kings, emperors, nobles, clergy, intellectuals and naturalists from the 16th to 18th century, with pieces reaching courts in Prague, Abras Castle, El Escorial and various other cities in Europe. Some even went as far as China, Japan and [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref name=arusso5/&gt;[[File:Huanitzin.jpg|thumb|250x250px|The ''[[Mass of St. Gregory]]'', feathers on wood panel, the oldest dated feather work with a Christian subject. Made by or for [[Diego de Alvarado Huanitzin|Diego Huanutzin]], nephew and son in law of [[Moctezuma II]] to present to [[Pope Paul III]], dated 1539, now in the [[Musée des Jacobins (Auch)|Musée des Jacobins]] in [[Auch]], [[France]].]]In addition to the images, feathers were used to adorn priests' clothing such as chasubles, rain capes and [[mitre|miters]]. They also made feather decorations for church altars and convents.&lt;ref name=tcastello21/&gt; Feathered miters and other vestments were sent and gifted to European bishops, especially in southern Europe and were used while conducting Mass.&lt;ref name=arusso5/&gt; Although there are no written records to indicate that this use of feathered vestments were a result of Mexican influence, they did not appear until after the mid 16th century.&lt;ref name=tcastello160&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;  European engravings were used as a model for feather images created for miters which today can be still found in Milan, Florence and New York. However, these and other Christian images were not exact copies of the prints as elements from several prints were combined and even pre Hispanic motifs appeared in some. These miters served as an innovation in the pictoral language of the church as the vestments themselves added a kind of power through their magnificence.&lt;ref name=arusso1920&gt;Russo, p. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

Monastery schools in Mexico, especially those run by the Franciscans and Augustinians, taught feather work, especially the creation of feather mosaics.&lt;ref name=tcastello21/&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello152&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; The skills of these artists remained important initially, even able to reproduce Latin calligraphy. One important example of this is  "Sacras de Ambras" at the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]. Here, black feathers are pasted over a ribbon of small white feathers.&lt;ref name=tcastello125/&gt; One particularly notable area of colonial feather working was in Patzcauaro, Michoacán. These workers maintained many of the ancient privileges of pre Hispanic feather workers.&lt;ref name=tcastello147152&gt;Castello Yturbide, pp. 147&amp;ndash;152&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesoamerican feather work inspired European works such as the Libro di piume (The Feather Book) by Dionisio Minaggio, the gardener to the governor of Milan, who learned the technique and created reproductions of birds in his regions, as well as portraits of the actors of the Commedia dell'arte.&lt;ref name=arusso56&gt;Russo, pp. 5&amp;ndash;6&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists such as Tommaso Ghisi and Jacopo Ligozzi used the technique as well to create works for the collections of the Medicis, Aldrovandi, Settala and Rudolf II of Prague.&lt;ref name=arusso6/&gt; Ulisse Aldrovandi described the creation of feather mosaics as a "threshold between art and science."&lt;ref name=arusso14&gt;Russo, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Featherwork 1600-1900==
The "golden age" of Mexican feather work lasted until the very beginning of the 17th century, when it declined because the old masters disappeared. At this time, demand for the work declined as well, because the Spanish began to disdain indigenous handcrafts and oil painting became preferred for the production of religious images.&lt;ref name=tcastello12/&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello22&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, imagery done in feather work became more varied, including the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] and those from [[European mythology]], especially on fans for ladies.&lt;ref name=tcastello200&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello128&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques changed to include a profusion of paper strips on mosaics, replacing the earlier use of gold trimmings.&lt;ref name=tcastello208&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; One image of the Virgin of Guadalupe is completely of feathers. While she is clothed in the usual way, the image lacks many of the decorations and symbols that are now standard. This may indicate that this is one of the first copies of the image.&lt;ref name=tcastello128/&gt; Another important 17th century piece depicts the [[Assumption of Mary]], now in the [[Museum of the Americas (Madrid)|Museum of the Americas in Madrid]] .&lt;ref name=tcastello130&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

More modification of the technique occurred in the 18th century, perhaps because it was no longer done only by the indigenous. Feather work was supplemented with the use of oil paint to depict people (especially faces and hands), landscapes and animals and tiny strips of paper were dropped along with the outer borders.&lt;ref name=tcastello208/&gt;&lt;ref name=arusso29&gt;Russo, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

By the nineteenth century, the craft all but disappeared with only some limited activity in Michoacán. Many were done with cheap, dyed feathers, smaller works with little artistic value.&lt;ref name=tcastello22/&gt; They, however, still attracted attention from visitors to Mexico. In 1803, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] visited [[Pátzcuaro]] and both a feather image of Our Lady of Health, which is now in a German museum. Her hands and face are in oil but the rest is in hummingbird feathers.&lt;ref name=tcastello208/&gt; Count Beltrani traveled in Mexico in 1830 and mentioned Michoacan feather work in his journals, obtaining two mosaics.  [[Frances Erskine Inglis, 1st Marquise of Calderón de la Barca|Frances Calderon de la Barca]], with of the first Spanish ambassador to Mexico, noted that the mosaics of saints and angels were crude in drawing but exquisite in coloring.&lt;ref name=tcastello209&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

The nuns at the Santa Rosa Convent in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]] were noted for their feather work in the 19th century, with several notable works still in existence.&lt;ref name=tcastello209/&gt; In the mid 19th century, [[lithography]] was introduced in Mexico and some prints were used as bases for feather work, which were then backed with sheet metal. In Puebla, this was a popular technique for folk figures such as the China Poblana.&lt;ref name=tcastello213&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; The last innovation in the craft was the use of photographs. One such work used a photograph of Juan Arriaga de Yturbe done by Monico Guzman Alvarez of Patzcuaro, done in 1895.&lt;ref name=tcastello214&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

==Featherwork 1900-2000==
By the 20th century, feather work existed as a handcraft, rather than as art. One reason for this was that the disappearance of many bird species has led to a lack of fine feathers.&lt;ref name=tcastello221&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the century feather work images were almost exclusively of postcards or other informal forms, with images of cockfights or birds made with dyed chicken or turkey feathers. [[Manuel Gamio]] tried to revive feather work's artistic nature. In 1920 he designed and supervised the creation of two mural panels, one with an Aztec serpent and the other with a Mayan serpent, copied from archeological pieces. It was done on black silk with quetzal feathers, gold, silver and silk threads. However, the fate of these works is not known.&lt;ref name=tcastello221/&gt;

Similarly, garments made with feathers have also almost completely disappeared. The only vestige of this is the wedding huipil made by the Tzotzils in Zinacatlan, Chiapas. However, these have the feathers added to commercially made cotton thread, anchored to it as decoration. Thread spun with feathers is no longer made.&lt;ref name=hmeneses2526&gt;Meneses, pp. 25&amp;ndash;26&lt;/ref&gt;  One other notable piece was a reproduction of the "Montezuma headdress" made for the [[Museo Nacional de Antropología|Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City]].&lt;ref name=tcastello22/&gt;

In the latter 20th century, a number of artists tried to bring back the technique as an art form. Painter and tapestry weaver Carmen Padin began researching the technique after hearing Fernando Gamboa lament its loss. From 1979 to 1981, she exhibited her work in various cities of Mexico which included robes, capes, shields and collages. However, she had to stop by the 1990s because of the difficultly of obtaining feathers.&lt;ref name=tcastello221/&gt; Josefina Ortega Salcedo became attracted to the technique after reading about it in the Artes de México magazine. She studied drawing and painting at the [[Academy of San Carlos]] with the goal of applying them to feather work. Her most valuable work in this medium includes several portraits, copied from photographs with precision. Her images are placed on a base of light-colored feathers with the images arranged using crepe paper cut outs and colored feathers.  However, she, too, no longer works with this technique.&lt;ref name=tcastello222&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Those who still continue to work with it include Elena Sanchez Garrido, who combines feather work and watercolors, and Tita Bilbaro who makes Aztec and modern style images using feathers, sand, fabric, leather, mirrors an sea shells. In the late 1980s she exhibited her work in Mexico City and several places in northern Mexico.&lt;ref name=tcastello225&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ConcheroMAPDF.JPG|thumb|Headdress for the Concheros dance at the [[Museo de Arte Popular]] in Mexico City]]
One notable family that continues the technique as a handcraft is the Olay family. This tradition began when Gabriel Olay traveled with a mule train and hunted birds during his wanderings. Then an indigenous person taught him the basics of feather working. He developed his craft then passed it onto his children and grandchildren. Most of the family works on reproductions of pre Hispanic images. Son Gabriel Olay Olay has created a large body of work in the technique and lives in [[Tlalpujahua]], Michoacan. Four of his pieces are part of the collection of the Morelia Cultural Center and others in various museums in the state of Michoacan. His image of the Virgin of Guadalupe was given by Mexican president [[Luis Echeverría]] to [[Pope John XXIII]] and is part of the Vatican's collection. Grandson Hans Matias Olay specializes in reproducing the birds and flowers that the [[Nahua peoples|Nahuas]] in [[Guerrero]] paint on amate paper. In 1990, the National Museum of Anthropology held an exhibit of works by Gabriel Olay Ramos and his sisters Gloria and Esperanza.  Olay Ramos lives in Mexico City and mostly uses rooster and hen feathers dyed in different colors. The Olays try to maintain as much of the pre Hispanic technique as possible, avoiding peacock and pheasant feathers as they are not native to Mexico. They use Campeche wax to affix the feathers and amate paper as the backing.&lt;ref name=tcastello222223&gt;Castello Yturbide, pp. 222&amp;ndash;223&lt;/ref&gt;

Other workers with feathers include Juan Carlos Ortiz of Puebla who also creates feather mosaics, Jorge Castillo of [[Taxco]] who combines silver and feathers.&lt;ref name=tcastello226&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common use of feathers in modern Mexico is in the creation of traditional dance costumes. These include the headdresses for dances such as the Quetzales in [[Puebla]] and the Concheros performed in various parts of central Mexico. In Oaxaca, there is the Dance of the Feather, which used dyed ostrich feathers and for the Dance of Calala, in [[Suchiapa]], Chiapas, the main dancer uses a fan of turkey and rooster feathers. Ostrich feathers are the most common in traditional dance costumes, followed by rooster, turkey and hen feathers. Despite their bright color, peacock feathers are rarely used. In most cases, the symbolic meaning of the feathers has been forgotten. One notable exception is the [[Huichol]]s, who have maintained much of their original cosmology.&lt;ref name=tcastello227&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable featherwork pieces==
Despite its popularity from in the late Mesoamerican period into the early colonial period, few vestiges with this technique survive into the 21st century.&lt;ref name=hmeneses11&gt;Meneses, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  One reason for this is the care needed to maintain the pieces. It is important to know the characteristics of each type of feather to use and preserve them correctly. The best feathers to use are those that have been molted, as they have less organic materials and less likely to deteriorate.  A feather object can last indefinitely if it is preserved in a hermetically sealed case of inert gas, with a fixed humidity, darkness and low temperature. However, this renders the piece unobservable. These objects can be exhibited in galleries, museums and private collections with minimal decay if temperature and humidity are controlled and light kept to a minimum.&lt;ref name=tcastello238/&gt;

Perhaps the best known piece is the so-called Montezuma's headdress. Despite its name, research has proven that it was not worn by the Aztec emperor. It was most likely made for an image as it looks like the one for Quetzalcoatl depicted in the [[Codex Magliabechiano]]. The original is in the Museum of Ethnology in Vienna. A replica made with authentic techniques was made for the Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City.&lt;ref name=tcastello70/&gt;

Because of the sending of many fine feather mosaics to Europe, a number of important pieces are located in museums and other collections on that continent. The oldest feather piece created by Christian indigenous workers is the Misa de San Gregorio at the Museum of the Jacobins in [[Auch]], France. It was commissioned by [[Diego de Alvarado Huanitzin|Diego de Huanitzin]], a converted member of Moctezuma's family and [[Pedro de Gante]]. It was probably made by artisans from San Jose de Belen de los Naturales. It is dated 1539 and given as a gift to [[Pope Paul III]] by [[Antonio de Mendoza]], according to the inscription, following the [[papal bull]] that declared the indigenous to be endowed with reason and able to fully participate in Catholic rites. It is probably the piece never made it to the Pope and its interim fate is unknown. However, it was rediscovered in 1987, when a second-hand clothes dealer took it to auction in Paris.&lt;ref name=arusso17&gt;Russo, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello118119&gt;Castello Yturbide, pp. 118&amp;ndash;119&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable work is from the 19th century called San Lucas pintando a la Virgen, located in the [[Musée de l'Homme]] in Paris. It is attributed to painter [[Juan Correa]]. The clothing is done in feathers but the face and hands were done in oil.&lt;ref name=tcastello138&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a number of important feather mosaic pieces remain in Mexico. San Pedro is a work from the 16th century, found at the archbishopric of Puebla and shows Roman influence in the style.&lt;ref name=tcastello120&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Another piece in Puebla is a portrait of [[Juan de Palafox y Mendoza]], who protected the Indians in Puebla.&lt;ref name=tcastello126&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; La Piedad is from the 17th century at the [[Franz Mayer Museum]]. It depicts Mary with Jesus dead on her lap.&lt;ref name=tcastello130/&gt; Another piece in this museum is the Virgen del Rosario, from the 17th century, with the imagery of the Rosary important to counter Islam and Protestantism.&lt;ref name=tcastello135&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; One important 16th century image is Salvator Mundi at the [[Museo del Virreinato, Tepotzotlán|Museum of Tepotzotlan]]. It shows influence from Byzantine iconography including Asian features. In the four corners there are Cyrillic characters repeated that have not been deciphered. The inscription FILIUS appears on the right when it should be on the left.&lt;ref name=arusso17/&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello120/&gt;

No examples of pre Conquest feather fabric survive, and only a few survive from the colonial period.&lt;ref name=tcastello85&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Important cloths of this type include two mantles from [[San Miguel Zinacantepec]], the Huipil of La Malinche at the Museum of Anthropology, the Tlamachayatl at the Ethnographic and Historical Museum  in Rome and the Paño Novohispano at the Museo Textil de Oaxaca.&lt;ref name=hmeneses1112&gt;Meneses, pp. 11&amp;ndash;12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello8889&gt;Castello Yturbide, pp. 88&amp;ndash;89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hmeneses24&gt;Meneses, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  All have feathers or feather pieces either embroidered onto or twisted into cotton. The Paño is a remnant of a huipil with feathers woven into the cloth, and is of a very similar design to the Malinche huipil.&lt;ref name=hmeneses1214&gt;Meneses, p. 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Church vestments, especially miters can be found in various collections in Europe including the Vatican. The church of [[Santa Maria in Vallicella]], Rome preserves two 18th century sets of vestments which were gifts from Mexico. These include two miters with a base of flax paper and silk with white feathers glued onto it. Against this background are small pieces of paper sewn on, then with colored feathers glued to these to form floral wreath patterns.&lt;ref name=tcastello98&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

'''Mikhail Alexandrovich Kaneev''' was born April 5, 1923 in Kaneevo village, [[Kostroma Province]] of USSR. In 1927 his family moved to Leningrad. In 1937 Mikhail Kaneev entered in the [[Leningrad Secondary Art School]] (now known as the Art School named after [[Boris Ioganson]]) at the All-Russian Academy of Arts, which ends in 1941.

In the same year Mikhail Kaneev entered at the first course of Department of Painting at the [[Repin Institute of Arts|Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]]. Since the beginning of the [[Great Patriotic War]] he was drafted into the [[Red Army]] and returned to classes only after the Victory in 1945. He studied of Ivan Stepashkin, Leonid Ovsiannikov, [[Mikhail Avilov]], and [[Yuri Neprintsev]].

In 1951 Mikhail Kaneev graduated from [[Repin Institute of Arts|Ilya Repin Institute]] in [[Rudolf Frentz]] workshop. His graduation work was historical painting "By Stalin's route" (the first ever nonstop flight by [[Valery Chkalov]], [[Georgiy Baidukov]], and [[:ru:Беляков, Александр Васильевич|Alexander Beliakov]] on the route Moscow – Vancouver in 1937).&lt;ref&gt;''Anniversary Directory graduates of Saint Petersburg State Academic Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture named after Ilya Repin, Russian Academy of Arts. 1915–2005''. – Saint-Petersburg: Pervotsvet Publishing House, 2007. - p.64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1953 Mikhail Kaneev has participated in Art Exhibitions. He painted landscapes, cityscapes, genre paintings, etudes done from nature. Mostly known as a master of the cityscapes of the Leningrad and ancient Russian towns. Decorative and graphic style of his paintings were distinguished by clarity of the silhouette, black and white contrasts. The artist often used a black stroke that makes it possible to paint the light places without the addition of white pigment, seeking the intensity of color.

Mikhail Kaneev was a member of the [[Leningrad Union of Artists]] since 1953. In 1961–1983 Kaneev taught at the [[Herzen University|Herzen Pedagogical University]] in Leningrad, where he was professor and a head of Drawing Department. In 1982 Mikhail Kaneev was awarded the Honorary title of the Honored Art Worker of the Russian Federation.

Mikhail Alexandrovich Kaneev died in Leningrad on March 6, 1983, at the sixtieth year of life. His paintings reside in State Russian Museum, in Art museums and private collections in Russia, USA,&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism.

'''''Nine Maneaters And One Rogue''''' is the first book of jungle tales and [[man-eaters]] written by [[Kenneth Anderson (writer)|Kenneth Anderson]], first published in 1954 by George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.

==Dedication==
"To the memory of the jungle of the Southern India, their birds and animals, particularly [[Indian elephant|elephant]], [[Bengal tiger|tiger]] and [[Indian leopard|panther]], and their forest-people, Chensoos, Sholagas, Karumbas and Poojarees, I proudly and gratefully dedicate this book, in return for the twenty-five years of unadulterated joy they have given me in making and keeping their acquaintance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Kenneth|title=Nine Man Eaters and One Rogue|year=1954|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
'''Introduction'''&lt;br /&gt;
Anderson discusses the causes of man-eating in tigers and panthers, as well as possible causes of an elephant becoming [[Rogue elephant|rogue]].

'''The Maneater of Jowlagiri'''&lt;br /&gt;
A tigress turns man-eater after being wounded by a poacher in the [[Jowlagiri]] area. After the death toll reaches around fifteen, Anderson is contacted to track down the beast. Anderson has an agonizing wait sat over a human kill, followed by a lucky escape when the man-eater starts to stalk him. The man-eater is not heard of again for another five months, and when a fresh human kill is reported Anderson heads back to Jowlagiri - where he manages to lure the tigress to her death by imitating a tiger's [[mating call]].

'''The Spotted Devil of Gummlapur'''&lt;br /&gt;
Over an area of some {{convert|250|mi2}}, a man-eating leopard is responsible for some 42 human deaths. When Anderson arrives to dispatch the animal, villagers are reluctant to assist  as they believed the 'shaitan' would hear of it and hasten their death. Anderson spends his nights waiting up for the panther, first using himself as bait and then changing tact and using a dummy. On one such night he comes across a stray dog, which he keeps with him for company in his hut. The dog ends up saving his life by signalling when the panther finally arrives at Anderson's hut - in repayment Anderson takes the dog home and names him 'Nipper'.

'''The Striped Terror of Chamala Valley'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 1937 a tiger is responsible for the death of seven people in the space of six months. Anderson locates the tiger by tying out baits, and though not fully equipped he decides to sit up over a kill and await the tigers return. Successfully killing the tiger, the locals help to carry it back to the village, though Anderson begins to doubt if in fact this is the correct tiger. Days later a report reaches him of a further tiger attack in the region, Anderson arrives on the scene and tracks the trail of the tiger up a dry stream bed... this time he  has found the right tiger.

'''The Hosdurga-Holalkere Man-eater'''&lt;br /&gt;
Anderson recounts the cat and mouse game that ensued in the hunt for the Hosdurga-Holalkere man-eating tiger along with his friend Mac. Whilst sitting over human remains atop a large cluster of boulders, Anderson sits with his back to a sheer drop of 12 foot and as such believes himself safe from an attack from the rear - but unexpectedly that is where the [[man-eater]] decides to attack.

'''The Rogue Elephant of Panapatti'''&lt;br /&gt;
An elephant with one whole tusk and one half tusk turns rogue in the Panapatti area and is responsible for multiple human deaths. Anderson first encounters the elephant when out trying to bag a [[peacock]] - armed only with a shotgun. Anderson escapes unscathed, though the elephant goes on to attack a camp of people - causing the government to double its reward for the animal. Anderson spends four laborious days tracking the elephant through the jungle, finally coming across a lone elephant - but is unsure if it is the right animal until it turns to face him...

'''The Maneater of Segur'''&lt;br /&gt;
After first recounting a story of a pack of [[dhole|wild dogs]] taking on a tigress in the [[Nilgiri Hills]], Anderson goes on to detail his hunt for the man-eating tiger of the same region. After a run in with a [[sloth bear]] family, and two failed vigils over two different human kills, Anderson comes across the one-eyed tiger by chance when a [[Sambar (deer)|sambar]] deer sounds its warning.

'''The Maneater of Yemmaydoddi'''&lt;br /&gt;
Early in 1946 a small male tiger appeared in the Yemmaydoddi locality and started lifting local cattle. In 1948 after breaking down in Tiptur, Anderson and his friend Alfie finally arrive in Birur to find they are given the choice of shooting either a cattle lifting panther or a cattle lifting tiger. Unfortunately they opt for the panther, as after they leave the region the cattle lifting tiger is wounded badly in the lower jaw by a local villager protecting his cattle and turns man-eater. Anderson returns to the region and months go by of monotonous nights of waiting, until finally Anderson gets a shot at the tiger. Only managing to wound the animal, he returns the next day to track the tiger with the help of a herd of buffalo.

'''The Killer of Jalahalli'''&lt;br /&gt;
During a rabbit beat in the Jalahalli region, a leopard (previously wounded by a policeman) caught between the nets and the beaters with dogs, succeeds in mauling six people in order to escape. Locals persist in trying to bring the leopard to bag, but the leopard is a fighter and survives their assaults - in the progress managing to maul a total of 11 people and kill 3.  Anderson arrives in the area and the leopard again manages to escape the attempt on his life, obtaining more wounds in the progress. The next day Anderson follows circling vultures to the body of the leopard which had painfully succumbed to its many wounds.

'''The Hermit of Devarayandurga'''&lt;br /&gt;
A local tigress is nicknamed 'the hermit' due to its shabby appearance and choice of abode. Not a recorded man-eater, it reportedly was very aggressive towards humans, and killed two men and one woman. After spending some very cold all night vigils sat over baits, Anderson gets a shot at the tigress. Badly wounding the animal, he has a tense morning following its distinctive blood trail until he puts an end to 'the hermit'.

'''Byra the Poojaree'''&lt;br /&gt;
Anderson recounts how a chance meeting with a [[poacher]], turns into a close friendship of over 25 years and who appears in many of his hunting stories. Anderson shares some such tales about Byra, including a vicious bear attack and Byra's part in hunting a man-eater in the Muthur area.

'''The Tigers of Tagarthy '''&lt;br /&gt;
Anderson found the village of Tagarthy to have no less than 4 tigers operating in the area, and on one single day - eight cattle kills were reported to have been made by tigers. Anderson recounts his own close encounters with the tigers of the region, including the story of how local man Sham Rao Bapat comes to shoot one of these tigers in his garden, and Anderson's own hunt for the hostile, cattle lifting tiger of Goowja.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5308">'''Ockham’s Razor Theatre Company''' is a British aerial theatre company. Their critically acclaimed work combines circus and theatre,&lt;ref name="Circfut"/&gt; and they specialise in creating [[physical theatre]] on original pieces of aerial equipment and create stories from the vulnerability, trust and reliance that exists between people in the air.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; Ockham's Razor are produced by Turtle Key Arts.

==Background==
The company was formed in 2004 by Alex Harvey, Tina Koch and Charlotte Mooney.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; With their unique physical skills the company have performed a number of shows that "combine circus and visual theatre to make work that is arresting and entertaining".&lt;ref name="Turtle"/&gt; The company’s name derives from a philosophy of [[William of Ockham]] known as [[Ockham's Razor]] that states that the simplest theory should always be chosen – this reflects the way in which the company work as they aim to always keep their work understandable and easy for the audience to relate to.&lt;ref name="Programme"/&gt; Rather than portray the circus performer as a superhuman character capable of impressive feats, they create works that draw on the human and the real, where the characters go through recognisable experiences, emotions and conflicts which the audience can identify with and relate to.

== Productions ==
The company’s shows include ''Arc'', ''Every Action...'', ''Memento Mori'',&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stage"/&gt; ''The Mill'', and the upcoming ''Not Until We Are Lost'' as well as various other projects for young children and families such as ''Hang On'' and ''Something in the Air''; an “audience participatory show for young people with complex disabilities”.&lt;ref name="Projects"/&gt; ''The Mill'', a piece about work and physical labour reviewed by Lyn Gardner as "a terrifically imaginative and original show",&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; is their most recent and first feature length play, directed by [[Toby Sedgwick]] (director of ''War Horse'') with [[Rufus Norris]] as dramaturg.

== The Founders of the Company ==
Alex Harvey, Charlotte Mooney and Tina Koch were all students of [[Circomedia]],&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; Academy of Circus Arts and Physical Performance in [[Bristol]] when they met. They had previously all been studying unrelated theatre subjects at separate universities: Harvey studied Fine Art at [[De Montfort University]] in [[Leicester]], Mooney studied English Literature with Spanish at the [[University of Sussex]] as well as [[University of Santiago, Chile|La Universidad de Santiago, Chile]], and Koch studied Cultural Science and Aesthetic Communication at [[University of Hildesheim|Universität Hildesheim]], originally training as a dancer.&lt;ref name="Programme" /&gt; Each found a passion for circus and physical theatre during their studies and went on together to found Ockham’s Razor Theatre Company.

A '''proverb''' (from {{lang-la|proverbium}}) is a simple, concrete, traditional [[saying]] that expresses a truth based on common sense or experience. Proverbs are often [[metaphor]]ical and use [[formulaic speech|formulaic language]]. Collectively, they form a [[folklore genre|genre of folklore]].

Some proverbs exist in more than one language because people borrow them from languages and cultures similar to theirs. In the West, the Bible (including, but not limited to the [[Book of Proverbs]]) and medieval Latin (aided by the work of [[Erasmus]]) have played a considerable role in distributing proverbs. Not all Biblical proverbs, however, were distributed to the same extent:  one scholar has gathered evidence to show that cultures in which the Bible is the "major spiritual book contain between three hundred and five hundred proverbs that stem from the Bible,"&lt;ref&gt;p. 12, Wolfgang Mieder. 1990. ''Not by bread alone: Proverbs of the Bible''.  New England Press.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas another shows that, of the 106 most common and widespread proverbs across Europe, eleven are from the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Paczolay, Gyula. 1997. ''European Proverbs in 55 Languages''. Veszpre'm, Hungary.&lt;/ref&gt; However, almost every culture has its own unique proverbs.

== Definitions ==
What is a proverb?  [[Lord John Russell]] (c. 1850) observed poetically that a "proverb is the wit of one, and the wisdom of many."&lt;ref&gt;p. 25. Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. "The wit of one, and the wisdom of many: General thoughts on the nature of the proverb. ''Proverbs are never out of season: Popular wisdom in the modern age'' 3-40. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; But giving the word "proverb" the sort of definition theorists need has proven to be a difficult task, and although scholars often quote [[Archer Taylor]]'s argument that formulating a scientific "definition of a proverb is too difficult to repay the undertaking... An incommunicable quality tells us this sentence is proverbial and that one is not. Hence no definition will enable us to identify positively a sentence as proverbial,"&lt;ref&gt;p. 3 Archer Taylor. 1931. ''The Proverb''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; many students of proverbs have attempted to itemize its essential characteristics. 

More constructively, Mieder has proposed the following definition, "A proverb is a short, generally known sentence of the folk which contains wisdom, truth, morals, and traditional views in a metaphorical, fixed, and memorizable form and which is handed down from generation to generation".&lt;ref&gt;p. 5. Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. "The wit of one, and the wisdom of many: General thoughts on the nature of the proverb. Proverbs are never out of season: Popular wisdom in the modern age 3-40. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Norrick created a table of [[distinctive feature]]s to distinguish proverbs from idioms, cliches, etc.&lt;ref&gt;p. 73. Neil Norrick. 1985. ''How Proverbs Mean: Semantic Studies in English Proverbs''. Amsterdam: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; Prahlad distinguishes proverbs from some other, closely related types of sayings, "True proverbs must further be distinguished from other types of proverbial speech, e.g. proverbial phrases, [[Wellerism]]s, maxims, quotations, and proverbial comparisons."&lt;ref&gt;p. 33. Sw. Anand Prahlad. 1996. ''African-American Proverbs in Context''. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Persian proverbs, Zolfaghari and Ameri propose the following definition: "A proverb is a short sentence, which is well-known and at times rhythmic, including advice, sage themes and ethnic experiences, comprising simile, metaphor or irony which is well-known among people for its fluent wording, clarity of expression, simplicity, expansiveness and generality and is used either with or without change".&lt;ref&gt;p. 107, Hassan Zolfaghari &amp; Hayat Ameri. "Persian Proverbs: Definitions and Characteristics". ''Journal of Islamic and Human Advanced Research'' 2(2012) 93-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many sayings in English that are commonly referred to as "proverbs", such as weather sayings. [[Alan Dundes]], however, rejects including such sayings among truly proverbs: "Are weather proverbs proverbs? I would say emphatically 'No!'"&lt;ref&gt;p. 45. Alan Dundes. 1984. On whether weather 'proverbs' are proverbs. ''Proverbium'' 1:39-46. Also, 1989, in ''Folklore Matters'' edited by Alan Dundes, 92-97. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of "proverb" has also changed over the years.  For example, the following was labeled "A Yorkshire proverb" in 1883, but would not be categorized as a proverb by most today, "as throng as Throp's wife when she hanged herself with a dish-cloth".&lt;ref&gt;A Yorkshire proverb. 1883. ''The Academy''. July 14, no. 584. p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; The changing of the definition of "proverb" is also noted in Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;Ezgi Ulusoy Aranyosi. 2010. "Atasözü neydi, ne oldu?" ["What was, and what now is, a 'proverb'?"]. ''Millî Folklor: International and Quarterly Journal of Cultural Studies'' 11.88: 5-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other languages and cultures, the definition of "proverb" also differs from English. In the [[Chumburung language]] of Ghana, "''aŋase'' are literal proverbs and ''akpare'' are metaphoric ones".&lt;ref&gt;p. 64. Gillian Hansford. 2003. Understanding Chumburung proverbs. ''Journal of West African Languages'' 30.1:57-82.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Bini of Nigeria, there are three words that are used to translate "proverb": ''ere, ivbe'', and ''itan''. The first relates to historical events, the second relates to current events, and the third was "linguistic ornamentation in formal discourse".&lt;ref&gt;p. 4,5. Daniel Ben-Amos. Introduction: Folklore in African Society. ''Forms of Folklore in Africa'', edited by Bernth Lindfors, pp. 1-36. Austin: University of Texas.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Balochi language|Balochi]] of Pakistan and Afghanistan, there is a word ''batal'' for ordinary proverbs and ''bassīttuks'' for "proverbs with background stories".&lt;ref&gt;p. 43. Sabir Badalkhan. 2000. "Ropes break at the weakest point": Some examples of Balochi proverbs with background stories. ''Proverbium'' 17:43-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also language communities that combine proverbs and riddles in some sayings, leading some scholars to create the label "proverb riddles".&lt;ref&gt;John C. Messenger, Jr. Anang Proverb-Riddles. The Journal of American Folklore Vol. 73, No. 289 (July - September 1960), pp. 225-235.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 418. Finnegan, Ruth. ''Oral Literature in Africa''. The Saylor Foundation, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Umoh, S. J. 2007. The Ibibio Proverb—Riddles and Language Pedagogy. ''International Journal of Linguistics and Communication'' 11(2), 8-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Conseil Tenu par les Rats.jpg|thumb|"Who will bell the cat?", comes from the end of a story.]]

Proverbs come from a variety of sources. Some are, indeed, the result of people pondering and crafting language, such as some by [[Confucius]], [[Plato]], [[Baltasar Gracián]], etc. Others are taken from such diverse sources as poetry,&lt;ref&gt;Korosh Hadissi. 2010. A Socio-Historical Approach to Poetic Origins of Persian Proverbs. ''Iranian Studies'' 43.5: 599-605.&lt;/ref&gt; stories,&lt;ref&gt;Thamen, Hla. 2000. ''Myanmar Proverbs in Myanmar and English''. Yangon: Pattamya Ngamank Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; songs, commercials, advertisements, movies, literature, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Charles Clay, Wolfgang Mieder, [[Fred R. Shapiro]]. 2012. ''The Dictionary of Modern Proverbs.'' New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of the well known sayings of Jesus, Shakespeare, and others have become proverbs, though they were original at the time of their creation, and many of these sayings were not seen as proverbs when they were first coined. Many proverbs are also based on stories, often the end of a story.  For example, the proverb "[[Belling the cat|Who will bell the cat]]?" is from the end of a story about the mice planning how to be safe from the cat.&lt;ref&gt;p. 68. Kent, Graeme. 1991. ''Aesop's Fables.'' Newmarket, UK: Brimax.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have created proverbs in their writings, such a [[J.R.R. Tolkien]],&lt;ref name="Michael Stanton 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trokhimenko, Olga 2003"/&gt; and some of these proverbs have made their way into broader society, such as the bumper sticker pictured below. Similarly, C.S. Lewis' created proverb about a lobster in a pot, from the ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'', has also gained currency.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Unseth. 2014. A created proverb in a novel becomes broadly used in society: "‛Easily in but not easily out', as the lobster said in his lobster pot." ''Crossroads: A Journal of English Studies'' [http://www.crossroads.uwb.edu.pl/category/issue-22014/page/2/ online access] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526192406/http://www.crossroads.uwb.edu.pl/category/issue-22014/page/2/ |date=2015-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases like this, deliberately created proverbs for fictional societies have become proverbs in real societies. In a fictional story set in a real society, the movie ''Forrest Gump'' introduced "Life is like a box of chocolates" into broad society.&lt;ref&gt;p. 70, Winick, Stephen. 1998. ''The Proverb Process: Intertextuality and Proverbial Innovation in Popular Culture.'' University of Pennsylvania: PhD dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt; In at least one case, at appears that a proverb deliberately created by one writer has been naively picked up and used by another who assumed it to be an established Chinese proverb, [[Ford Madox Ford]] having picked up a proverb from [[Ernest Bramah]], "It would be hypocrisy to seek for the person of the Sacred Emperor in a Low Tea House."&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorn, Jeremy, ‘Ernest Bramah: Source of Ford Madox Ford’s Chinese Proverb?’ Notes and Queries, 63.2 (2016), 286-288.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proverb with "a longer history than any other recorded proverb in the world", going back to "around 1800 BC"&lt;ref&gt;p. 5. Alster, Bendt. 1979. An Akkadian and a Greek proverb. A comparative study. ''Die Welt des Orients'' 10. 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; is in a Sumerian clay tablet, "The bitch by her acting too hastily brought forth the blind".&lt;ref&gt;p. 17. Moran, William L. 1978a. An Assyriological gloss on the new Archilochus fragment. ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 82. 17-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Though many proverbs are ancient, they were all newly created at some point by somebody.  Sometimes it is easy to detect that a proverb is newly coined by a reference to something recent, such as the Haitian proverb "The fish that is being microwaved doesn't fear the lightning".&lt;ref&gt;p. 325, Linda Tavernier-Almada. 1999. Prejudice, power, and poverty in Haiti: A study of a nation's culture as seen through its proverbs. ''Proverbium'' 16:325-350.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there is a recent [[Maltese language|Maltese]] proverb, ''wil-muturi, ferh u duluri'' "Women and motorcycles are joys and griefs"; the proverb is clearly new, but still formed as a traditional style couplet with rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;p. 125. Aquilina, Joseph. 1972. ''A Comparative Dictionary of Maltese Proverbs.'' Malta: Royal University of Malta.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there is a proverb in the [[Kafa language]] of Ethiopia that refers to the forced military conscription of the 1980s, "...the one who hid himself lived to have children."&lt;ref&gt;Mesfin Wodajo. 2012. ''Functions and Formal and Stylistic Features of Kafa Proverbs''. LAP Lambert Academic Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; A Mongolian proverb also shows evidence of recent origin, "A beggar who sits on gold; Foam rubber piled on edge."&lt;ref&gt;p. 22, Janice Raymond. ''Mongolian Proverbs: A window into their world.'' San Diego: Alethinos Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  A political candidate in Kenya popularised a new proverb in his 1995 campaign, ''Chuth ber'' "Immediacy is best". "The proverb has since been used in other contexts to prompt quick action."&lt;ref&gt;p. 68. Okumba Miruka. 2001. ''Oral Literature of the Luo''. Nairobi: East African Educational Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 1,400 new English proverbs are said to have been coined and gained currency in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Clay Doyle, Wolfgang Mieder, Fred R. Shapiro. 2012. ''The Dictionary of Modern Proverbs.''  Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This process of creating proverbs is always ongoing, so that possible new proverbs are being created constantly. Those sayings that are adopted and used by an adequate number of people become proverbs in that society.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5. Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. ''Proverbs are never out of season.'' New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mieder, Wolfgang. 2017. Futuristic Paremiography and Paremiology: A Plea for the Collection and Study of Modern Proverbs. ''Poslovitsy v frazeologicheskom pole: Kognitivnyi, diskursivnyi, spoostavitel’nyi aspekty''. Ed. T.N. Fedulenkova. Vladimir: Vladimirskii Gosudarstvennyie Universitet, 2017. 205-226.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations ==
Interpreting proverbs is often complex, but is best done in a context.&lt;ref&gt;Jesenšek, Vida. 2014. Pragmatic and stylistic aspects of proverbs. ''Introduction to Paremiology: A Comprehensive Guide to Proverb Studies'', ed. by Hrisztalina Hrisztova-Gotthardt and Melita Aleksa Varga, pp. 133-161. Warsaw &amp; Berlin: DeGruyter Open.&lt;/ref&gt; Interpreting proverbs from other cultures is much more difficult than interpreting proverbs in one's own culture. Even within English-speaking cultures, there is difference of opinion on how to interpret the proverb "[[A rolling stone gathers no moss]]." Some see it as condemning a person that keeps moving, seeing moss as a positive thing, such as profit; others see the proverb as praising people that keep moving and developing, seeing moss as a negative thing, such as negative habits.&lt;ref&gt;p. 224,225. Flavell, Linda and roger Flavell. 1993. ''The Dictionary of Proverbs and Their Origins''. London: Kyle Cathie.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, among [[Tajik language|Tajik]] speakers, the proverb "One hand cannot clap" has two significantly different interpretations. Most see the proverb as promoting teamwork. Others understand it to mean that an argument requires two people.&lt;ref&gt;p. 158. Evan Bell. 2009. ''An analysis of Tajik proverbs''. Masters thesis, Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; In an extreme example, one researcher working in Ghana found that for a single Akan proverb, twelve different interpretations were given.&lt;ref&gt;Sjaak van der Geest. 1996. The Elder and His Elbow: Twelve Interpretations of an Akan Proverb. ''Research in African Literatures'' Vol. 27, No. 3: 110-118.&lt;/ref&gt; Children will sometimes interpret proverbs in a literal sense, not yet knowing how to understand the conventionalized metaphor. Interpretation of proverbs is also affected by injuries and diseases of the brain, "A hallmark of schizophrenia is impaired proverb interpretation."&lt;ref name="Michael Kiang 2007"&gt;Michael Kiang, et al, Cognitive, neurophysiological, and functional correlates of proverb interpretation abnormalities in schizophrenia. ''Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society'' (2007), 13, 653–663.[Futuristic paremiography and paremiology: a plea for the collection and study of modern proverbs. Online access]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
===Grammatical structures===
Proverbs in various languages are found with a wide variety of grammatical structures.&lt;ref&gt;See Mac Coinnigh, Marcas. Syntactic Structures in Irish-Language Proverbs. ''Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship'' 29, 95-136.&lt;/ref&gt; In English, for example, we find the following structures (in addition to others):
* Imperative, negative - Don't beat a dead horse.
* Imperative, positive - Look before you leap.
* Parallel phrases - Garbage in, garbage out.
* Rhetorical question - Is the Pope Catholic?
* Declarative sentence - Birds of a feather flock together.

However, people will often quote only a fraction of a proverb to invoke an entire proverb, e.g. "All is fair" instead of "All is fair in love and war", and "A rolling stone" for "A rolling stone gathers no moss."

The grammar of proverbs is not always the typical grammar of the spoken language, often elements are moved around, to achieve rhyme or focus.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian J. Floor. 2005. Poetic Fronting in a Wisdom Poetry Text: The Information Structure of Proverbs 7. ''Journal of Northwest Semitic Languages'' 31: 23-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of grammatical structure in proverbs is a short dialogue:
* Shor/Khkas (SW Siberia): "They asked the camel, 'Why is your neck crooked?' The camel laughed roaringly, 'What of me is straight?'"&lt;ref&gt;p. 176. Roos, Marti, Hans Nugteren, Zinaida Waibel. 2006. Khakas and Shor proverbs and proverbial sayings. In ''Exploring the Eastern Frontiers of Turkic'', ed by Marcel Erdal and Irina Nevskaya, pp. 157-192. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Armenian language|Armenian]]: "They asked the wine, 'Have you built or destroyed more?' It said, 'I do not know of building; of destroying I know a lot.'"&lt;ref&gt;p. 135. Sakayan, Dora. 1999. Reported and direct speech in proverbs: On Armenian dialogue proverbs. Proverbium 16: 303-324.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bakgatla [a.k.a. [[Tswana language|Tswana]]:  "The thukhui jackal said, 'I can run fast.' But the sands said, 'We are wide.'" ([[Botswana]])&lt;ref&gt;p. 246. Mitchison, Naomi and Amos Kgamanyane Pilane. 1967. The Bakgatla of South-East Botswana As Seen through Their Proverbs. ''Folklore'' Vol. 78, No. 4: 241-268.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bambara language|Bamana]]: "'Speech, what made you good?' 'The way I am,' said Speech. 'What made you bad?' 'The way I am,' said Speech." (Mali)&lt;ref&gt;p. 221. Kone, Kasim. 1997.'' Bamana verbal art: An ethnographic study of proverbs''. PhD dissertation, Indiana University.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ochsenfurt Hauptstraße 60 Schuster.jpg|thumb|"The cobbler should stick to his last" in German. It is also an old proverb in English, but now [[last]] is no longer known to many.]]
===Conservative language===
[[File:Latijnse tekst boven portaal.JPG|left|thumb|Latin proverb overdoorway in Netherlands: "No one attacks me with impunity"]]
Because many proverbs are both poetic and traditional, they are often passed down in fixed forms. Though spoken language may change, many proverbs are often preserved in conservative, even [[Archaism|archaic]], form. In English, for example, "betwixt" is not used by many, but a form of it is still heard (or read) in the proverb "There is many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip." The conservative form preserves the meter and the rhyme. This conservative nature of proverbs can result in archaic words and grammatical structures being preserved in individual proverbs, as has been documented in Amharic,&lt;ref&gt;p. 691. Michael Ahland. 2009. From topic to subject: Grammatical change in the Amharic possessive construction. ''Studies in Language'' 33.3 pp. 685-717.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek,&lt;ref&gt;p. 72. Nikolaos Lazaridis. 2007. ''Wisdom in Loose Form: The Language of Egyptian and Greek Proverbs in Collections of the Hellenistic and Roman Periods.'' Brill&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nsenga language|Nsenga]],&lt;ref&gt;p. 64. Christopher J. Pluger. 2014. ''Translating New Testament proverb-like sayings in the style of Nsenga proverbs.'' Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics MA thesis.&lt;/ref&gt; and Polish.&lt;ref&gt;Szpila, Grzegorz. 2001. Archaic lexis in Polish Proverbs. In Władysław Witalisz (ed.), ''"And gladly wolde he lerne and gladly teche": Studies on Language and Literature in Honour of Professor Dr. Karl Heinz Göller'', pp. 187-193. Kraków 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, proverbs may still be used in languages which were once more widely known in a society, but are now no longer so widely known. For example, English speakers use some non-English proverbs that are drawn from languages that used to be widely understood by the educated class, e.g. "C'est la vie" from French and "[[Carpe diem]]" from Latin. 

Proverbs are often handed down through generations. Therefore, "many proverbs refer to old measurements, obscure professions, outdated weapons, unknown plants, animals, names, and various other traditional matters."&lt;ref&gt;p. 33. Wolfgang Mieder. 2014. ''Behold the Proverbs of a People: Proverbial Wisdom in Culture, Literature, and Politics.'' Jackson, MS: University Press of Mississippi.&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, it is common that they preserve words that become less common and archaic in broader society.&lt;ref&gt;Issa O. Sanusi and R.K. Omoloso. The role of Yoruba proverbs in preserving archaic lexical items and expressions in Yoruba.

[[File:The-Blind-Leading-the-Blind-xx-Sebastian-Vrancx.JPG|thumb|"[[The blind leading the blind]]", a saying that has spread across Europe, found in the ''Upanishads'' and the ''Bible'']]
Proverbs are often and easily translated and transferred from one language into another. "There is nothing so uncertain as the derivation of proverbs, the same proverb being often found in all nations, and it is impossible to assign its paternity."&lt;ref&gt;p. ii. Thomas Fielding. 1825. Select proverbs of all nations. New York: Covert.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proverbs are often borrowed across lines of language, religion, and even time.  For example, a proverb of the approximate form "No flies enter a mouth that is shut" is currently found in Spain, France, Ethiopia, and many countries in between.  It is embraced as a true local proverb in many places and should not be excluded in any collection of proverbs because it is shared by the neighbors.  However, though it has gone through multiple languages and millennia, the proverb can be traced back to an ancient Babylonian proverb (Pritchard 1958:146). Another example of a widely spread proverb is "A drowning person clutches at [frogs] foam", found in Peshai of Afghanistan&lt;ref&gt;p. 67. Ju-Hong Yun and Pashai Language Committee. 2010. On a mountain there is still a road. Peshawar, Pakistan: InterLit Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; and Orma of Kenya,&lt;ref&gt;p. 24. Calvin C. Katabarwa and Angelique Chelo. 2012. Wisdom from Orma, Kenya proverbs and wise sayings. Nairobi: African Proverbs Working Group. http://www.afriprov.org/images/afriprov/books/wisdomofOrmaproverbs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably places in between.

Proverbs about one hand clapping are common across Asia,&lt;ref&gt;Kamil V. Zvelebil. 1987. The Sound of the One Hand.  Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 107, No. 1, pp. 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt; from Dari in Afghanistan&lt;ref&gt;p. 16, Edward Zellem. 2012. Zarbul Masalha: 151 Aghan Dari proverbs.&lt;/ref&gt; to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;p. 164. Philip B. Yampolsky, (trans.). 1977.  The Zen Master Hakuin: Selected Writings. New York, Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have been done devoted to the spread of proverbs in certain regions, such as India and her neighbors&lt;ref&gt;Ludwik Sternbach. 1981. Indian Wisdom and Its Spread beyond India. Journal of the American Oriental Society Vol. 101, No. 1,  pp. 97-131.&lt;/ref&gt; and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Matti Kuusi; Marje Joalaid; Elsa Kokare; Arvo Krikmann; Kari Laukkanen; Pentti Leino; Vaina Mālk; Ingrid Sarv. Proverbia Septentrionalia. ''900 Balto-Finnic Proverb Types with Russian, Baltic, German and Scandinavian Parallels''. Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; An extreme example of the borrowing and spread of proverbs was the work done to create a corpus of proverbs for [[Esperanto]], where all the proverbs were translated from other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Fiedler, Sabine. 1999. Phraseology in planned languages. ''Language problems and language planning'' 23.2: 175-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often not possible to trace the direction of borrowing a proverb between languages. This is complicated by the fact that the borrowing may have been through plural languages. In some cases, it is possible to make a strong case for discerning the direction of the borrowing based on an artistic form of the proverb in one language, but a prosaic form in another language. For example, in Ethiopia there is a proverb "Of mothers and water, there is none evil." It is found in [[Amharic]], [[Alaba-K'abeena language|Alaaba language]], and [[Oromo language|Oromo]], three languages of Ethiopia:
* Oromo: ''Hadhaa fi bishaan, hamaa hin qaban.''
* Amharic: ''Käənnatənna wəha, kəfu yälläm.''
* Alaaba" ''Wiihaa ʔamaataa hiilu yoosebaʔa''&lt;ref&gt;p. 92. Gertrud Schneider-Blum. 2009. ''Máakuti t'awá shuultáa: Proverbs finish the problems: Sayings of the Alaaba (Ethiopia)''. Köln: Rüdiger Köppe Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Oromo version uses poetic features, such as the initial ''ha'' in both clauses with the final ''-aa'' in the same word, and both clauses ending with ''-an''. Also, both clauses are built with the vowel ''a'' in the first and last words, but the vowel ''i'' in the one syllable central word. In contrast, the Amharic and Alaaba versions of the proverb show little evidence of sound-based art.

However, not all languages have proverbs. Proverbs are (nearly) universal across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Some languages in the Pacific have them, such as Maori.&lt;ref&gt;Brougham, Aileen E., Alexander Wyclif Reed, and Tīmoti Sam Kāretu. ''The Reed book of Maori proverbs.'' Reed Books, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Pacific languages do not, e.g. "there are no proverbs in [[Kilivila]]" of the [[Trobriand Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 277. Senft, Gunter. 2010. ''The Trobriand Islanders' Ways of Speaking.'' (Volume 27 of Trends in Linguistics. Documentation.) Berlin: Walter de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the New World, there are almost no proverbs: "While proverbs abound in the thousands in most cultures of the world, it remains a riddle why the Native Americans have hardly any proverb tradition at all."&lt;ref&gt;p. 108. Mieder, Wolfgang. 2004. ''Proverbs: A handbook. Greenwood Publishing Group.''&lt;/ref&gt; Hakamies has examined the matter of whether proverbs are found universally, a universal genre, concluding that they are not. &lt;ref&gt;Hakamies, Pekka. 2016. "Proverbs - A Universal Genre?", in ''Multidisciplinary Perspectives on Folklore and Beyond'', ed. by Kaarina Koski and Frog with Ulla Savolainen, p. 299-316. Helsinki: Finnish Literature Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
===In conversation===
Proverbs are used in conversation by adults more than children, partially because adults have learned more proverbs than children. Also, using proverbs well is a skill that is developed over years. Additionally, children have not mastered the patterns of metaphorical expression that are invoked in proverb use. Proverbs, because they are indirect, allow a speaker to disagree or give advice in a way that may be less offensive. Studying actual proverb use in conversation, however, is difficult since the researcher must wait for proverbs to happen.&lt;ref&gt;Elias Dominguez Baraja. 2010. ''The function of proverbs in discourse''. Berlin: de Gruyter Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; An Ethiopian researcher, Tadesse Jaleta Jirata, made headway in such research by attending and taking notes at events where he knew proverbs were expected to be part of the conversations.&lt;ref name="Tadesse Jaleta Jirata 2009"&gt;Tadesse Jaleta Jirata. 2009. A contextual study of the social functions of Guji-Oromo proverbs. Saabruecken: DVM Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In literature===
[[File:Not all who wander are lost.png|thumb|[http://www.elvenminstrel.com/tolkien/proverbs.htm Created proverb] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''Lord of the Rings'' on a bumper sticker.]]

Many authors have used proverbs in their writings, for a very wide variety of literary genres: epics,&lt;ref&gt;Yuldybaeva, G.V. 2013. On Research of the Style of the Bashkir Folk Epic "Ural-Batyr" pp. 121-122. ''ETHNOLOGICAL STUDIES OF SHAMANISM AND OTHER INDIGENOUS SPIRITUAL BELIEFS AND PRACTICES'', Vol. 15, part 2, pp. 121,122. Moscow.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsaaior, James Tar (2010), "Webbed words: masked meanings: proverbiality and narrative/discursive strategies in D. T. Niane's Sundiata: An Epic of Mali". ''Proverbium'' 27: 319–338.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adjandeh, Evelyn Aku. 2014. ''A study of Proverbs in "Things Fall Apart" and "Sundiata: An Epic of Old Mali (Sundiata)''.&lt;/ref&gt; novels,&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Obiechina. Culture, tradition and society in the West African novel. Vol. 14. CUP Archive, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; poems,&lt;ref&gt;Renker, Elizabeth. 2014. “Melville and the Worlds of Civil War Poetry.” ''Leviathan'' 16 (2014): 135–52.&lt;/ref&gt;, short stories.&lt;ref&gt;2017. Peter Unseth and Georgi Kapchits. Hemingway’s Somali proverb confirmed. ''ANQ: A Quarterly Journal of Short Articles, Notes and Reviews'' 30(4):253-254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the most famous user of proverbs in novels is [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in his ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' series.&lt;ref name="Michael Stanton 1996"&gt;Michael Stanton. 1996. Advice is a dangerous gift. ''Proverbium'' 13: 331-345&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trokhimenko, Olga 2003"&gt;Trokhimenko, Olga. 2003. "If You Sit on the Doorstep Long Enough, You Will Think of Something": The Function of Proverbs in J. R. R. Tolkien's Hobbit." ''[[Proverbium (journal)]]''20: 367-378.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elvenminstrel.com/tolkien/proverbs.htm|title=Tolkien's Proverbs in The Lord of the Rings|website=www.elvenminstrel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, David. 2016. ''The proverbs of Middle-Earth'', 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herman Melville]] is noted for creating proverbs in [[Moby Dick]]&lt;ref&gt;p. 30. Hayes, Kevin. Melville’s Folk Roots. Kent: Kent State UP, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and in his poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Unseth, Peter. 2015. The Source of Melville’s Iroquois Proverb. ''ANQ: A Quarterly Journal of Short Articles, Notes and Reviews'' 28:3-4, 182-185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 141. Renker, Elizabeth. 2014. Mellville and the Worlds of Civil War Poetry. ''Leviathan'' 16: 135–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[C. S. Lewis]] created a dozen proverbs in ''[[The Horse and His Boy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Unseth, Peter. 2011. A culture "full of choice apophthegms and useful maxims": invented proverbs in C.S. Lewis' ''The Horse and His Boy'' ''Proverbium'' 28: 323-338.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mercedes Lackey]] created dozens for her invented [[Shin'a'in]] and Tale'edras cultures;&lt;ref&gt;Proverbs from Velgarth - http://www.dragonlordsnet.com/danp.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Lackey's proverbs are notable in that they are reminiscent to those of Ancient Asia - e.g. "Just because you feel certain an enemy is lurking behind every bush, it doesn't follow that you are wrong" is like to "Before telling secrets on the road, look in the bushes." These authors are notable for not only using proverbs as integral to the development of the characters and the story line, but also for creating proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Unseth, Peter. 2011. A culture "full of choice apophthegms and useful maxims": invented proverbs in C.S. Lewis' ''The Horse and His Boy'' ''Proverbium'' 28: 323-338.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among medieval literary texts, [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s [[Troilus and Criseyde]] plays a special role because Chaucer's usage seems to challenge the truth value of proverbs by exposing their epistemological unreliability.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Utz, "''Sic et Non'': Zu Funktion und Epistemologie des Sprichwortes bei Geoffrey Chaucer," ''Das Mittelalter: Perspektiven mediävistischer Forschung'' 2.2 (1997), 31-43.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rabelais]] used proverbs to write an entire chapter of [[Gargantua]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 903. Taylor, Archer. 1950. Proverbs. ''Funk and Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology and Legend'', Maria Leach ed. 902-905. New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls.&lt;/ref&gt;

The patterns of using proverbs in literature can change over time. A study of "classical Chinese novels" found proverb use as frequently as one proverb every 3,500 words in ''Water Margin'' (''Sui-hu chuan'') and one proverb every 4,000 words in ''Wen Jou-hsiang''. But modern Chinese novels have fewer proverbs by far.&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard, W. 1967. Some notes on the use of proverbs in Chinese novels. ''Proverbium'' no. 9: 201-208.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hercules &amp; Waggoner2.jpg|left|thumb|"Hercules and the Wagoner", illustration for children's book]]
Proverbs (or portions of them) have been the inspiration for titles of books: ''The Bigger they Come'' by [[Erle Stanley Gardner]], and ''Birds of a Feather'' (several books with this title), ''Devil in the Details'' (multiple books with this title). Sometimes a title alludes to a proverb, but does not actually quote much of it, such as ''The Gift Horse's Mouth'' by Robert Campbell.  Some books or stories have titles that are twisted proverbs, anti-proverbs, such as ''No use dying over spilled milk'',&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Tamar. 1996. ''No use dying over spelled milk''. New York: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; ''When life gives you lululemons,''&lt;ref&gt;Weisburger, Lauren. 2018. ''When life gives you lululemons.'' Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; and two books titled ''Blessed are the Cheesemakers''.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Sarah-Kate. 2004. ''Blessed are the Cheesemakers''. Grand Central Publications and Tricia Goyr &amp; Cara Putman. 2016. ''Blessed are the Cheesemakers.''&lt;/ref&gt; The twisted proveb of last title was also used in the [[Monty Python]] movie [[Life of Brian]], where a person mishears one of Jesus Christ's [[beatitudes]], "I think it was 'Blessed are the cheesemakers.'"

Some books and stories are built around a proverb. Some of Tolkien's books have been analyzed as having "governing proverbs" where "the acton of a book turns on or fulfills a proverbial saying."&lt;ref&gt;p. 332. Stanton, Michael. 1996. "Advice is a dangerous gift": (Pseudo)proverbs in ''The Lord of the Rings''. ''Proverbium'' 13:331-346.&lt;/ref&gt; Some stories have been written with a proverb overtly as an opening, such as "A stitch in time saves nine" at the beginning of "Kitty's Class Day", one of [[Louisa May Alcott]]'s ''Proverb Stories''. Other times, a proverb appears at the end of a story, summing up a moral to the story, frequently found in [[Aesop's Fables]], such as "[[God helps those who help themselves|Heaven helps those who help themselves]]" from ''Hercules and the Wagoner''.&lt;ref&gt;p. 19. Kent, Graeme. 1991. ''Aesop's Fables.'' Newmarket, UK: Brimax.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proverbs have also been used strategically by poets.&lt;ref&gt;Sobieski, Janet and Wolfgang Mieder. 2005. ''"So many heads, so many wits": An anthology of English proverb poetry.'' (Supplement Series of ''Proverbium'', 18.) Burlington, VT: University of Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes proverbs (or portions of them or [[anti-proverb]]s) are used for titles, such as "A bird in the bush" by [[Hilton Young, 1st Baron Kennet|Lord Kennet]] and his stepson [[Peter Scott]] and "[[The blind leading the blind]]" by Lisa Mueller. Sometimes, multiple proverbs are important parts of poems, such as [[Paul Muldoon]]'s "Symposium", which begins "You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it hold its nose to the grindstone and hunt with the hounds. Every dog has a stitch in time..." The Turkish poet Refiki wrote an entire poem by stringing proverbs together, which has been translated into English poetically yielding such verses as "Be watchful and be wary, / But seldom grant a boon; / The man who calls the piper / Will also call the tune."&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Macfie and F. A. Macfie. 2001. A Proverb Poem by Refiki. ''Asian Folklore Studies'' Vol. 60, Issue 1, pp. 5-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because proverbs are familiar and often pointed, they have been used by a number of hip-hop poets. This has been true not only in the USA, birthplace of hip-hop, but also in Nigeria. Since Nigeria is so multilingual, hip-hop poets there use proverbs from various languages, mixing them in as it fits their need, sometimes translating the original. For example,
&lt;br /&gt;"They forget say ogbon ju agbaralo
&lt;br /&gt;They forget that wisdom is greater than power"&lt;ref&gt;p. 43. Akande, Akinmade Timothy and Adebayo
Mosobalaje. 2014. The use of proverbs in hip-hop music: The example of Yoruba proverbs in 9ices's music. ''Proverbium'' 31:35-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have bent and twisted proverbs, creating anti-proverbs, for a variety of literary effects. For example, in the [[Harry Potter]] novels, [[J. K. Rowling]] reshapes a standard English proverb into "It's no good crying over spilt potion" and [[Dumbledore]]
advises Harry not to "count your owls before they are delivered".&lt;ref&gt;Heather A. Haas. 2011. The Wisdom of Wizards—and Muggles and Squibs: Proverb Use in the World of Harry Potter. ''Journal of American Folklore'' 124(492): 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In a slightly different use of reshaping proverbs, in the [[Aubrey–Maturin series]] of historical naval novels by [[Patrick O'Brian]], Capt. [[Jack Aubrey]] humorously mangles and mis-splices proverbs, such as "Never count the bear's skin before it is hatched" and "There's a good deal to be said for making hay while the iron is hot."&lt;ref&gt;Jan Harold Brunvand. 2004. "The Early Bird Is Worth Two in the Bush": Captain Jack Aubrey's Fractured Proverbs. ''What Goes Around Comes Around: The Circulation of Proverbs in Contemporary Life'', Kimberly J. Lau, Peter Tokofsky, Stephen D. Winick, (eds.), pp. 152-170. Logan, Utah: Utah State University Press. [http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1032&amp;context=usupress_pubs&amp;sei-redir=1#search=%22What%20Goes%20Around%20Comes%20Around%3A%20Circulation%20Proverbs%20Contemporary%20Life%2C%22 digitalcommons.usu.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier than O'Brian's Aubrey, [[Beatrice Grimshaw]] also used repeated splicings of proverbs in the mouth of an eccentric marquis to create a memorable character in ''The Sorcerer's Stone'', such as "The proof of the pudding sweeps clean" (p.&amp;nbsp;109) and "A stitch in time is as good as a mile" (p.&amp;nbsp;97).&lt;ref&gt;Grimshaw, Beatrice. 1914. ''The Sorcerer’s Stone.'' Philadelphia: John Winston.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because proverbs are so much a part of the language and culture, authors have sometimes used proverbs in historical fiction effectively, but anachronistically, before the proverb was actually known. For example, the novel ''Ramage and the Rebels'', by [[Dudley Pope]] is set in approximately 1800. Captain Ramage reminds his adversary "You are supposed to know that it is dangerous to change horses in midstream" (p.&amp;nbsp;259), with another allusion to the same proverb three pages later. However, the proverb about changing horses in midstream is reliably dated to 1864, so the proverb could not have been known or used by a character from that period.&lt;ref&gt;p. 49, Jennifer Speake. 2008. ''The Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs'', 5th ed. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have used so many proverbs that there have been entire books written cataloging their proverb usage, such as [[Charles Dickens]],&lt;ref&gt;George Bryan and Wolfgang Mieder. 1997. ''The Proverbial Charles Dickens''. New York: Peter Lang&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agatha Christie]],&lt;ref&gt;George B. Bryan. 1993. ''Black Sheep, Red Herrings, and Blue Murder: The Proverbial Agatha Christie''. Bern: Peter Lang&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Bernard Shaw]],&lt;ref&gt;George B. Bryan and Wolfgang Mieder. 1994. ''The Proverbial Bernard Shaw: An Index to Proverbs in the Works of George Bernard Shaw''. Heinemann Educational Books.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cervantes]],&lt;ref&gt;Mieder, Wolfgang. 2006. Tilting at Windmills History &amp; Meaning of a Proverbial Allusion to Cervantes Don Quixote. Burlington: University of Vermont. {{ISBN|0977073130}}    {{ISBN|9780977073139}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Mieder, Wolfgang. 2017. ''"Stringing proverbs together'': The proverbial language in Miugel Cervantes's "Don Quixote"''.  (Supplement series to Provebium, 38.) Burlington: University of Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Nolte, Wolfgang Mieder. 2012.  Zu meiner Hölle will ich den Weg mit guten Sprüchen pflastern". Friedrich Nietzsches sprichwörtliche Sprache. Broschu.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the non-fiction side, proverbs have also been used by authors for articles that have no connection to the study of proverbs. Some have been used as the basis for book titles, e.g. ''I Shop, Therefore I Am: Compulsive Buying and the Search for Self'' by April Lane Benson. Some proverbs been used as the basis for article titles, though often in altered form: "All our eggs in a broken basket: How the Human Terrain System is undermining sustainable military cultural competence"&lt;ref&gt;Connable, Ben. (2009). All our eggs in a broken basket: How the Human Terrain System is undermining sustainable military cultural competence. Military Review, March–April: 57–64.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Should Rolling Stones Worry About Gathering Moss?"&lt;ref&gt;MUNISHWAR NATH GUPTA. 2017. ''Proceedings of the Indian National Science Academy'' 83 No. 4: 741-743.&lt;/ref&gt;, "Between a Rock and a Soft Place".&lt;ref&gt;Denig, Stephen J. Between a Rock and a Soft Place. ''Christian Higher Education'' 11.1 (2012): 44-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Proverbs have been noted as common in subtitles of articles&lt;ref&gt;p. 154. ''Introduction to Paremiology. A Comprehensive Guide to Proverb Studies'' edited by Hrisztalina Hrisztova-Gotthardt and Melita Aleksa Varga. Berlin: De Gruyter Open. Online: [http://www.degruyter.com/viewbooktoc/product/449649 Open Access version].&lt;/ref&gt; such as "Discontinued intergenerational transmission of Czech in Texas: 'Hindsight is better than foresight'."&lt;ref&gt;Cope, Lida. 2006. "Discontinued intergenerational transmission of Czech in Texas: 'Hindsight is better than foresight'." ''Southern Journal of Linguistics'' 30(2):1-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the reverse is found with a proverb (complete or partial) as the title, then an explanatory subtitle, "To Change or Not to Change Horses: The World War II Elections".&lt;ref&gt;Norpoth, Helmut. 2012. "To Change or Not to Change Horses: The World War II Elections." ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' Volume 42, Issue 2: 324–342.&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors have cited proverbs as epigrams at the beginning of their articles, e.g. "'If you want to dismantle a hedge, remove one thorn at a time' Somali proverb" in an article on peacemaking in Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;Ismail I. Ahmed and Reginald H. Green. 1999. The heritage of war and state collapse in Somalia and Somaliland. ''Third World Quarterly'' 20.1:113-127.&lt;/ref&gt; An article about research among the [[Māori people|Māori]] used a Māori proverb as a title, then began the article with the Māori form of the proverb as an epigram "Set the overgrown bush alight and the new flax shoots will spring up", followed by three paragraphs about how the proverb served as a metaphor for the research and the present context.&lt;ref&gt;Pia Pohatu and Tui Aroha Warmenhoven. 2007. Set the overgrowth alight and the new shoots will spring forth: New directions in community based research. ''AlterNative: An International Journal of Indigenous Scholarship'', Special supplement, 109-127.&lt;/ref&gt; A British proverb has even been used as the title for a doctoral dissertation: ''Where there is muck there is brass''.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Tony. 2016. ''Where there’s muck there’s brass! Coinage in the Northumbrian landscape and economy, c.575-c.867.'' Leeds University: Doctoral dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In drama and film===
[[File:Dog in manger poster.jpg|thumb|Play poster from 1899.]]
Similarly to other forms of literature, proverbs have also been used as important units of language in drama and films. This is true from the days of classical Greek works&lt;ref&gt;Russo, Joseph. 1983. The Poetics of the Ancient Greek Proverb. ''Journal of Folklore Research''
Vol. 20, No. 2/3, pp. 121-130&lt;/ref&gt; to [[old French]]&lt;ref&gt;Wandelt, Oswin. 1887. Sprichwörter und Sentenzen des altfranzösischen Dramas (1100-1400. Dissertation at Marburg Fr. Sömmering.&lt;/ref&gt; to Shakespeare,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, F.P. 1981. The proverbial wisdom of Shakespeare. In ''The Wisdom of Many: Essays on the Proverb'', ed. by Wolfgang Mieder and Alan Dundes, p. 174-189. New York: Garland.&lt;/ref&gt; to 19th Century Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Cazal. 2012. Los refranes en el Auto de Caín y Abel, de Jaime Ferruz: frontera entre texto dramático y enunciado proverbial. ''Paremia'' 21: 21-32.[http://www.paremia.org/wp-content/uploads/02-CAZAL.pdf Electronic form]&lt;/ref&gt; to today. The use of proverbs in drama and film today is still found in languages around the world, such as [[Yoruba language|Yorùbá]].&lt;ref&gt;Akíntúndé Akínyemi. 2007. The use of Yorùbá proverbs in Alin Isola's historical drama ''Madam Tinubu: Terror in Lagos''. ''Proverbium'' 24:17-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

A film that makes rich use of proverbs is ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', known for both using and creating proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen David Winick. 1998. "The proverb process: Intertextuality and proverbial innovation in popular culture". University of Pennsylvania dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen David Winick. 2013. Proverb is as proverb does. ''Proverbium''30:377-428.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies of the use of proverbs in film include work by Kevin McKenna on the Russian film ''[[Aleksandr Nevsky]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Kevin McKenna. 2009. "Proverbs and the Folk Tale in the Russian Cinema: The Case of Sergei Eisenstein's Film Classic Aleksandr Nevsky." ''The Proverbial «Pied Piper» A Festschrift Volume of Essays in Honor of Wolfgang Mieder on the Occasion of His Sixty-Fifth Birthday'', ed. by Kevin McKenna, pp. 277-292.

The Athlete: a movie about the Ethiopian barefooted Olympic champion. ''Journal of African Cultural Studies'' Vol. 25, No. 1, 119–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', the screenplay by [[Eric Roth]] had more proverbs than the novel by [[Winston Groom]], but for ''[[The Harder They Come]]'', the reverse is true, where the novel derived from the movie by [[Michael Thelwell]] has many more proverbs than the movie.&lt;ref&gt;Coteus, Stephen. 2011. "Trouble never sets like rain": Proverb (in)direction in Michael Thelwell's ''The Harder They Come''. ''Proverbium'' 28:1-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Éric Rohmer]], the French film director, directed a series of films, the "Comedies and Proverbs", where each film was based on a proverb: ''[[The Aviator's Wife]]'', ''[[Le Beau mariage|The Perfect Marriage]]'', ''[[Pauline at the Beach]]'', ''[[Full Moon in Paris]]'' (the film's proverb was invented by Rohmer himself: "The one who has two wives loses his soul, the one who has two houses loses his mind."), ''[[The Green Ray]]'', ''[[Boyfriends and Girlfriends]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pym, John. 1986/1987. Silly Girls. ''Sight and Sound'' 56.1:45-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Movie titles based on proverbs include ''[[Murder Will Out (1939 film)]]'', ''Try, Try Again'', and ''[[The Harder They Fall]]''. A twisted anti-proverb was the title for a [[Three Stooges]] film, ''[[A Bird in the Head]]''. The title of an award-winning Turkish film, [[Three Monkeys]], also invokes a proverb, though the title does not fully quote it.

They have also been used as the titles of plays:&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, George. 2002. Proverbial titles of dramas. ''Proverbium'' 19:65-74.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater|Baby with the Bathwater]]'' by [[Christopher Durang]], ''Dog Eat Dog'' by [[Mary Gallagher]], and ''[[The Dog in the Manger]]'' by [[Charles Hale Hoyt]]. The use of proverbs as titles for plays is not, of course, limited to English plays: ''Il faut qu'une porte soit ouverte ou fermée'' (A door must be open or closed) by [[Paul de Musset]].  Proverbs have also been used in musical dramas, such as ''The Full Monty'', which has been shown to use proverbs in clever ways.&lt;ref&gt;Konstantinova, Anna. 2012. Proverbs in an American musical: A cognitive-discursive study of "The Full Monty". ''Proverbium'' 29:67-93.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'', Gaston plays with three proverbs in sequence, "All roads lead to.../The best things in life are.../All's well that ends with me."

===In Music===

Proverbs are often poetic in and of themselves, making them ideally suited for adapting into songs. Proverbs have been used in music from opera to country to hip-hop. Proverbs have also been used in music in other languages, such as the [[Akan language]]&lt;ref&gt;p. 95 ff. Kwesi Yankah. 1989. ''The Proverb in the Context of Akan Rhetoric.'' Bern: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Igede language]],&lt;ref&gt;Ode S. Ogede. 1993. Proverb usage in the praise songs of Igede: ''Adiyah'' poet Micah Ichegbeh.  ''Proverbium'' 10:237-256.&lt;/ref&gt; and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Raúl Eduardo GONZÁLEZ HERNÁNDEZ. Refranes en las canciones de [[Chava Flores]]. ''Paremia'' 20: 2011, pp. 139-148. [http://www.paremia.org/wp-content/uploads/13.GONZALEZ.pdf Electronic access]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In English the proverb (or rather the beginning of the proverb), [[If the shoe fits (disambiguation)|If the shoe fits]] has been used as a title for three albums and five songs. Other English examples of using proverbs in music&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, Geoerge. 2001.  An unfinished List of Anglo-American Proverb Songs. ''Proverbium'' 18:15-56.&lt;/ref&gt; include [[Elvis Presley]]'s ''Easy come, easy go'', Harold Robe's ''Never swap horses when you're crossing a stream'', Arthur Gillespie's ''Absence makes the heart grow fonder'', [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''Like a rolling stone'', [[Cher]]'s ''Apples don't fall far from the tree''. [[Lynn Anderson]] made famous a song full of proverbs, ''[[Rose Garden (Lynn Anderson song)|I never promised you a rose garden]]'' (written by [[Joe South]]). In choral music, we find [[Michael Torke]]'s ''Proverbs'' for female voice and ensemble. A number of [[Blues]] musicians have also used proverbs extensively.&lt;ref&gt;Taft, Michael. 1994. Proverbs in the Blues. ''Proverbium'' 12: 227-258.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prahlad, Sw. Anand. 1996. ''African-American Proverbs in Context''. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi. See pp. 77ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The frequent use of proverbs in Country music has led to published studies of proverbs in this genre.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Folsom. 1993. ''A discography of American Country music hits employing proverb: Covering the years 1986-1992. Proceedings for the 1993.'' Conference of the Southwest/Texas Popular Culture Association, ed. by Sue Poor, pp. 31-42. Stillwater, Oklahoma: The Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Florian Gutman. 2007. "Because you're mine, I walk the line" Sprichwörliches in auswegewählten Liedern von Johnny Cash." ''Sprichwörter sind Goldes Wert'', ed. by Wolfgang Mieder, pp. 177-194. (Supplement series of ''Proverbium'' 25). Burlington, VT: University of Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Reggae]] artist Jahdan Blakkamoore has recorded a piece titled ''Proverbs Remix''. The opera ''Maldobrìe'' contains careful use of proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;V. Dezeljin. 1997. Funzioni testuali dei proverbi nel testo di ''Maldobrìe''. Linguistica (Ljubljana) 37: 89-97.&lt;/ref&gt; An extreme example of many proverbs used in composing songs is a song consisting almost entirely of proverbs performed by [[Bruce Springsteen]], "My best was never good enough".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqJeHXifgLk |title=Bruce Springsteen - My Best Was Never Good Enough - Live 2005 (opening night) video |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Mighty Diamonds]] recorded a song called simply "Proverbs".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyO2Chjy4LM Mighty Diamonds doing "Proverbs"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The band [[Fleet Foxes]] used the proverb painting [[Netherlandish Proverbs]] for the cover of their eponymous album [[Fleet Foxes (album)|Fleet Foxes.]]&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Jonathan. "Why I judge albums by their covers." Wednesday 25 February 2009. ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to proverbs being used in songs themselves, some rock bands have used parts of proverbs as their names, such as the [[Rolling Stones]], [[Bad Company]], [[The Mothers of Invention]], Feast or Famine, [[Of Mice and Men (band)|Of Mice and Men]]. There have been at least two groups that called themselves "The Proverbs", and there is a hip-hop performer in South Africa known as "Proverb".  In addition, many albums have been named with allusions to proverbs, such as ''Spilt milk'' (a title used by [[Jellyfish (band)|Jellyfish]] and also [[Kristina Train]]), ''The more things change'' by [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], ''Silk purse'' by [[Linda Ronstadt]], ''Another day, another dollar'' by DJ Scream Roccett, ''[[The blind leading the naked]]'' by [[Violent Femmes]], ''What's good for the goose is good for the gander'' by [[Bobby Rush (musician)|Bobby Rush]], ''Resistance is Futile'' by [[Steve Coleman]], ''Murder will out'' by [[Fan the Fury]]. The proverb ''Feast or famine'' has been used as an album title by [[Feast or Famine (Chuck Ragan album)|Chuck Ragan]], [[Feast or Famine (Reef the Lost Cauze album)|Reef the Lost Cauze]], Indiginus, and DaVinci. [[Whitehorse (band)|Whitehorse]] mixed two proverbs for the name of their album ''Leave no bridge unburned''. The band Splinter Group released an album titled ''[[When in Rome, do as the Romans do|When in Rome]], Eat Lions''. The band Downcount used a proverb for the name of their tour, ''[[Come and take it]]''.&lt;ref&gt;p. 10. Singh, Anup K. 2017. ''Dictionary of Proverbs''. Neelkanth Prakashan Publihsers.&lt;/ref&gt;

From ancient times, people around the world have recorded proverbs in visual form.  This has been done in two ways. First, proverbs have been ''written'' to be displayed, often in a decorative manner, such as on pottery, cross-stitch, murals,&lt;ref&gt;Victor Khachan. 2012. Courtroom proverbial murals in Lebanon: a semiotic reconstruction of justice. ''Social Semiotics'' DOI:10.1080/10350330.2012.665262&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Charlot. 2007. ''Local Traffic Only: Proverbs Hawaiian Style.'' Watermark Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kanga (African garment)|kangas]] (East African women's wraps),&lt;ref&gt;Rose Marie Beck. 2000. Aesthetics of Communication: Texts on Textiles (Leso) from the East African Coast (Swahili). ''Research in African Literatures'' 31.4: 104-124)&lt;/ref&gt; [[quilt]]s,&lt;ref&gt;MacDowell, Marsha and Wolfgang Mieder. "'When Life Hands You Scraps, Make a Quilt': Quiltmakers and the Tradition of Proverbial Inscriptions." ''Proverbium'' 27 (2010), 113-172.&lt;/ref&gt; a stained glass window,&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Reilly &amp; Mary B. Shepard (2016) “Sufferance fait ease en temps”: word as image at St Michael-le-Belfrey, York. ''Word &amp; Image'' 32:2, 218-234. DOI: 10.1080/02666286.2016.1167577.&lt;/ref&gt; and graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;Szpila, G. (2012). Regulating the reality? Proverbs in Polish graffiti, Estonia and Poland. ''Creativity and Tradition in Cultural Communication'' 1, 269-284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, proverbs have often been visually depicted in a variety of media, including paintings, etchings, and sculpture. [[Jakob Jordaens]] painted a plaque with a proverb about drunkenness above a drunk man wearing a crown, titled ''The King Drinks''. Probably the most famous examples of depicting proverbs are the different versions of the paintings ''[[Netherlandish Proverbs]]'' by the father and son [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] and [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]], the proverbial meanings of these paintings being the subject of a 2004 conference, which led to a published volume of studies (Mieder 2004a). The same father and son also painted versions of [[The Blind Leading the Blind]], a Biblical proverb. These and similar paintings inspired another famous painting depicting some proverbs and also idioms (leading to a series of additional paintings), such as ''[[Proverbidioms]]'' by [[T. E. Breitenbach]]. Another painting inspired by Bruegel's work is by the Chinese artist, Ah To, who created a painting illustrating 81 Cantonese sayings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://writecantonese8.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/cantonese-proverbs-in-one-picture/|title=Cantonese Proverbs in One Picture|date=25 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Corey Barksdale has produced a book of paintings with specific proverbs and pithy quotations.&lt;ref&gt;Corey Barksdale. 2011. ''Art &amp; Inspirational Proverbs''. Lulu.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The British artist [[Chris Gollon]] has painted a major work entitled "Big Fish Eat Little Fish", a title echoing Bruegel's painting Big Fishes Eat Little Fishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chrisgollon.com/collections/big-fish-eat-little-fish/ |title=Gollon's painting |access-date=2018-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220155210/http://www.chrisgollon.com/collections/big-fish-eat-little-fish/ |archive-date=2017-12-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oliver Pelton - Benjamin Franklin - Poor Richard's Almanac Illustrated.jpg|thumb|Illustrations showing proverbs from Ben Franklin]]
[[File:Three wise monkeys figure.JPG|thumb|[[Three wise monkeys]], invoking a proverb, with no text.]]
Sometimes well-known proverbs are pictured on objects, without a text actually quoting the proverb, such as the [[three wise monkeys]] who remind us "Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil". When the proverb is well known, viewers are able to recognize the proverb and understand the image appropriately, but if viewers do not recognize the proverb, much of the effect of the image is lost. For example, there is a Japanese painting in the [[Ōmiya Bonsai Village|Bonsai museum]] in [[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama city]] that depicted flowers on a dead tree, but only when the curator learned the ancient (and no longer current) proverb "Flowers on a dead tree" did the curator understand the deeper meaning of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;p. 426. Yoko Mori. 2012. Review of  ''Dictionary of Japanese Illustrated Proverbs''. ''Proverbium'' 29:435-456.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of school students found that students remembered proverbs better when there were visual representations of proverbs along with the verbal form of the proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Kamau, Wango. ''Use of Visual Illustration in the Interpretation of Proverbs in Secondary Schools in Kikuyu District, Kiambu County, Kenya''. Kenyatta University PhD dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt;

A bibliography on proverbs in visual form has been prepared by Mieder and Sobieski (1999). Interpreting visual images of proverbs is subjective, but familiarity with the depicted proverb helps.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 203-213. Richard Honeck. 1997. ''A Proverb in Mind''. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some artists have used proverbs and anti-proverbs for titles of their paintings, alluding to a proverb rather than picturing it. For example, [[Vivienne LeWitt]] painted a piece titled  "If the shoe doesn't fit, must we change the foot?", which shows neither foot nor shoe, but a woman counting her money as she contemplates different options when buying vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=database and e-research tool for art and design researchers |url=http://www.daao.org.au/bio/work/if-the-shoe-doesnt-fit-must-we-change-the-foot/ |title=If the shoe doesn't fit, must we change the foot? |work=Design and Art Australia Online |publisher=Daao.org.au |date=2012-10-20 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, 13 sculptures depicting Maltese proverbs were installed in open spaces of downtown [[Valletta]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20180203/community/valletta-statue-depicting-proverb-gets-tongues-wagging-online.669628 Article on Maltese proverb sculptures]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2018-02-02/local-news/A-bum-a-bird-and-a-pig-Valletta-2018-unveils-Kif-Jghid-Il-Malti-public-art-installations-6736184371|title=A bum, a bird and a pig: Valletta 2018 unveils ‘Kif Jgħid Il-Malti’ public art installations - The Malta Independent|website=Independent.com.mt|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/mobile/articles/view/20180202/arts-entertainment/valletta-2018-unveils-public-art-installations.669557|title=Arts &amp; Entertainment|website=Timesofmalta.com|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In cartoons===
Cartoonists, both editorial and pure humorists, have often used proverbs, sometimes primarily building on the text, sometimes primarily on the situation visually, the best cartoons combining both. Not surprisingly, cartoonists often twist proverbs, such as visually depicting a proverb literally or twisting the text as an anti-proverb.&lt;ref&gt;Trokhimenko, Olga V. 1999."Wie ein Elefant im Porzellanlanden": Ursprung, Überlieferung und Gebrauch der Redensart in Deutschen und im Englischen. ''Proverbium'' 16: 351-380&lt;/ref&gt; An example with all of these traits is a cartoon showing a waitress delivering two plates with worms on them, telling the customers, "Two early bird specials... here ya go."&lt;ref&gt;The Argyle Sweater, May 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional [[Three wise monkeys]] were depicted in [[Bizarro]] with different labels. Instead of the negative imperatives, the one with ears covered bore the sign "See and speak evil", the one with eyes covered bore the sign "See and hear evil", etc. The caption at the bottom read "The power of positive thinking."&lt;ref&gt;June 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another cartoon showed a customer in a pharmacy telling a pharmacist, "I'll have an ounce of prevention."&lt;ref&gt;p. 126. Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. ''Proverbs are never out of season.'' New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The comic strip [[The Argyle Sweater]] showed an Egyptian archeologist loading a mummy on the roof of a vehicle, refusing the offer of a rope to tie it on, with the caption "A fool and his mummy are soon parted."&lt;ref&gt;Aug 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The comic [[One Big Happy (comic strip)|One Big Happy]] showed a conversation where one person repeatedly posed part of various proverb and the other tried to complete each one, resulting in such humorous results as "Don't change horses... unless you can lift those heavy diapers."&lt;ref&gt;July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Editorial cartoon]]s can use proverbs to make their points with extra force as they can invoke the wisdom of society, not just the opinion of the editors.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraut, Edward James. 1999. "Michel und Mauer": Post-Unification Germany as seen through Editorial Cartoons. Die Unterrichtspraxis 32.2: 143-150.&lt;/ref&gt; In an example that invoked a proverb only visually, when a US government agency ([[General Services Administration|GSA]]) was caught spending money extravagantly, a cartoon showed a [[The pot calling the kettle black|black pot]] labeled "Congress" telling a black kettle labeled "[[General Services Administration|GSA]]", "Stop wasting the taxpayers' money!"&lt;ref&gt;Dana Summers, Orlando Sentinel, Aug 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It may have taken some readers a moment of pondering to understand it, but the impact of the message was the stronger for it.

Cartoons with proverbs are so common that Wolfgang Mieder has published a collected volume of them, many of them [[editorial cartoons]]. For example, a German editorial cartoon linked a current politician to the Nazis, showing him with a bottle of swastika-labeled wine and the caption "[[In vino veritas]]".&lt;ref&gt;p. 389. Wolfgang Mieder. 2013. ''Neues von Sisyphus: Sprichwörtliche Mythen der Anike in moderner Literatur, Medien und Karikaturen.'' Bonn: Praesens.&lt;/ref&gt;

One cartoonist very self-consciously drew and wrote cartoons based on proverbs for the University of Vermont student newspaper ''The Water Tower'', under the title "Proverb place".&lt;ref&gt;Brienne Toomey. 2013. Old wisdom reimagined: Proverbial cartoons for university students. ''Proverbium'' 30: 333-346.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Good things come to those who dont wait.JPG|thumb|''[[Anti-proverb]]'' used in advertising [[Chick-Fil-A]]]]
===In advertising===
[[File:Glass half full kind of day.JPG|left|thumb|''Anti-proverb'' used in [[advertising]]]]
Proverbs are frequently used in advertising, often in slightly modified form.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Mieder and Barbara Mieder. 1977. Tradition and innovation: Proverbs in advertising. ''Journal of Popular Culture'' 11: 308-319.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Winick. 2011. Fall into the (intertextual) gap: Proverbs, advertisements, and intertextual strategies. ''Proverbium'' 28:339-380.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Anne Audber de Baubeta. 2000. Bread, the staff of advertising. ''Paremia'' 9: 103-110. [http://www.paremia.org/wp-content/uploads/P9-12.pdf Online]&lt;/ref&gt;
Ford once advertised its Thunderbird with, "One drive is worth a thousand words" (Mieder 2004b: 84). This is doubly interesting since the underlying proverb behind this, "One picture is worth a thousand words," was originally introduced into the English proverb repertoire in an ad for televisions (Mieder 2004b: 83).

A few of the many proverbs adapted and used in advertising include:
* "Live by the sauce, dine by the sauce" ([[Buffalo Wild Wings]])
* "At D &amp; D Dogs, you can teach an old dog new tricks" (D &amp; D Dogs)
* "If at first you don't succeed, you're using the wrong equipment" ([[John Deere]])
* "A pfennig saved is a pfennig earned." ([[Volkswagen]])
* "Not only absence makes the heart grow fonder." ([[Godiva Chocolatier]])
* "Where Hogs fly" ([[Grand Prairie AirHogs]]) baseball team
* "Waste not. Read a lot." ([[Half Price Books]])

The [[GEICO]] company has created a series of television ads that are built around proverbs, such as "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScDoJ2wnug |title=GEICO Commercial - Bird in Hand |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The pen is mightier than the sword",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZd-ql7t1I |title=Is the Pen Mightier? - GEICO Commercial |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Pigs may fly/[[Flying pig|When pigs fly]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-r4Z1K_LDc |title=When pigs fly |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2012-12-18 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; "If a tree falls in the forest...",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pW2bE61Z9U|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Words can never hurt you".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCysb4_-4jU|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Doritos made a commercial based on the proverb, "When pigs fly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQo0TfuueaY|title=When Pigs Fly - Doritos Crash the Super Bowl 2015 WINNER OFFICAL [sic]|first=|last=Nelson Talbot|date=9 November 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many advertisements that use proverbs shorten or amend them, such as, "Think outside the shoebox." 
Use of proverbs in advertising is not limited to the English language. Seda Başer Çoban has studied the use of proverbs in Turkish advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Seda Başer Çoban. 2010. Sözlü Gelenekten Sözün. Geleneksizliğine: Atasözü Ve Reklam [From Oral Tradition to the Traditionless of Speech: Proverb and Advertisement]. ''Millî Folklor''. pp. 22-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Tatira has given a number of examples of proverbs used in advertising in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;Liveson Tatira. 2001. Proverbs in Zimbabwean advertisements. ''Journal of Folklore Research'' 38.3: 229-241.&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike the examples given above in English, all of which are anti-proverbs, Tatira's examples are standard proverbs. Where the English proverbs above are meant to make a potential customer smile, in one of the Zimbabwean examples "both the content of the proverb and the fact that it is phrased as a proverb secure the idea of a secure time-honored relationship between the company and the individuals". When newer buses were imported, owners of older buses compensated by painting a traditional proverb on the sides of their buses, "Going fast does not assure safe arrival".&lt;ref&gt;p. 233. Liveson Tatira. 2001. Proverbs in Zimbabwean advertisements. ''Journal of Folklore Research'' 38.3: 229-241.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
===Counter proverbs===
There are often proverbs that contradict each other, such as "Look before you leap" and "He who hesitates is lost", or "Many hands make light work" and "Too many cooks spoil the broth". These have been labeled "counter proverbs"&lt;ref name="Charles Clay Doyle 2012"&gt;Charles Clay Doyle. 2012. Counter proverbs. In ''Doing proverbs and other kinds of folklore'', by Charles Clay Doyle, 32-40. (Supplement series of ''Proverbium'' 33.) Burlington: University of Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt; or "antonymous proverbs".&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Furnham. 1987. The Proverbial Truth: Contextually Reconciling and the Truthfulness of Antonymous Proverbs. ''Journal of Language and Social Psychology'' 6. 1:49-55.&lt;/ref&gt; When there are such counter proverbs, each can be used in its own appropriate situation, and neither is intended to be a universal truth.&lt;ref&gt;p. 8. Singh, Anup K. 2017. ''Dictionary of Proverbs''. Neelkanth Prakashan Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oldberg, Ragnar. 1965. Ordsprak som poesi. ''Ord och Bild'' 74:564-568.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "counter proverb" is more about pairs of contradictory proverbs than about the use of proverbs to counter each other in an argument. For example, from the [[Tafi language]] of Ghana, the following pair of proverbs are counter to each other but are each used in appropriate contexts, "A co-wife who is too powerful for you, you address her as your mother" and "Do not call your mother's co-wife your mother..."&lt;ref&gt;p. 425, 421. Mercy Bobuafor. 2013. ''The Grammar of Tafi.'' University of Leiden doctoral dissertation.  [https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/20916/bookpart.pdf?sequence=23 link to dissertation]&lt;/ref&gt; In Nepali, there is a set of totally contradictory proverbs: "Religion is victorious and sin erodes" and "Religion erodes and sin is victorious".&lt;ref&gt;p. 378. Valerie Inchley. 2010. ''Sitting in my house dreaming of Nepal.'' Kathmandu: EKTA.&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, the following pair are counter proverbs from the Kasena of Ghana: "It is the patient person who will milk a barren cow" and "The person who would milk a barren cow must prepare for a kick on the forehead".&lt;ref&gt;p. 52, Helen Atawube Yitah. 2006. ''Saying Their Own 'truth': Kasena Women's (de)construction of Gender Through Proverbial Jesting.'' Doctoral dissertation, University of Southern California.&lt;/ref&gt; The two contradict each other, whether they are used in an argument or not (though indeed they were used in an argument). But the same work contains an appendix with many examples of proverbs used in arguing for contrary positions, but proverbs that are not inherently contradictory,&lt;ref&gt;p. 157-171, Helen Atawube Yitah. 2006. ''Saying Their Own 'truth': Kasena Women's (de)construction of Gender Through Proverbial Jesting.'' Doctoral dissertation, University of Southern California.&lt;/ref&gt; such as "One is better off with hope of a cow's return than news of its death" countered by "If you don't know a goat [before its death] you mock at its skin". Though this pair was used in a contradictory way in a conversation, they are not a set of "counter proverbs".&lt;ref&gt;p. 8. Singh, Anup K. 2017. ''Dictionary of Proverbs''. Neelkanth Prakashan Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing counter proverbs in the [[Badaga language]], Hockings explained that in his large collection "a few proverbs are mutually contradictory... we can be sure that the Badagas do not see the matter that way, and would explain such apparent contradictions by reasoning that proverb ''x'' is used in one context, while ''y'' is used in quite another."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hockings. 1988.

===Metaproverbs===
In many cultures, proverbs are so important and so prominent that there are proverbs about proverbs, that is, "metaproverbs". The most famous one is from [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] of Nigeria, "Proverbs are the horses of speech, if communication is lost we use proverbs to find it," used by [[Wole Soyinka]] in ''Death and the King's Horsemen''.  In Mieder's bibliography of proverb studies, there are twelve publications listed as describing metaproverbs.&lt;ref&gt;p. 1050. Wolfgang Mieder. 2008. ''International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology''. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; Other metaproverbs include:

There is a growing interest in deliberately using proverbs to achieve goals, usually to support and promote changes in society. On the negative side, this was deliberately done by the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;Mieder, Wolfgang. 1982. Proverbs in Nazi Germany: The Promulgation of Anti-Semitism and Stereotypes Through Folklore. ''The Journal of American Folklore'' 95, No. 378, pp. 435–464.&lt;/ref&gt; On the more positive side, proverbs have also been used for constructive purposes. For example, proverbs have been used for teaching foreign languages at various levels.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, April. 2004. Good Proverbs Make Good Students: Using Proverbs to Teach German Quickly.

Studia Anglica Posnaniensia: An International Review of English Studies 37: 173-200.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, proverbs have been used for public health promotion, such as promoting breast feeding with a shawl bearing a Swahili proverb "Mother's milk is sweet".&lt;ref&gt;[http://massbreastfeeding.org/aboutKanga.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724213805/http://massbreastfeeding.org/aboutKanga.html |date=July 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proverbs have also been applied for helping people manage diabetes,&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks, Leo and Rosetta Hendricks. 1994.

The most active field deliberately using proverbs is Christian ministry, where [[Joseph G. Healey]] and others have deliberately worked to catalyze the [[Paremiography|collection of proverbs]] from smaller languages and the application of them in a wide variety of church-related ministries, resulting in publications of collections&lt;ref&gt;Atido , George Pirwoth. 2011. Insights from Proverbs of the Alur in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  In Collaboration with African Proverb Saying and Stories, www.afriprov.org. Nairobi, Kenya.&lt;/ref&gt; and applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afriprov.org/ |title=African Proverbs, Sayings and Stories |publisher=Afriprov.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moon, Jay. 2009. ''African Proverbs Reveal Christianity in Culture'' (American Society of Missiology Monograph, 5). Pickwick Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This attention to proverbs by those in Christian ministries is not new, many pioneering proverb collections having been collected and published by Christian workers.&lt;ref&gt;Christaller, Johann. 1879.

U.S. Navy Captain [[Edward Zellem]] pioneered the use of [[Afghan proverbs]] as a positive relationship-building tool during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]], and in 2012 he published two bilingual collections&lt;ref&gt;Zellem, Edward. 2012. {{cite web|url=http://www.afghanproverbs.com|title=''Zarbul Masalha: 151 Afghan Dari Proverbs''|publisher=Charleston: CreateSpace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zellem, Edward. 2012. {{cite web|url=http://www.afghanproverbs.com|title=''Afghan Proverbs Illustrated''|publisher=Charleston: CreateSpace}}, now also available with translations into German, French, and Russian.&lt;/ref&gt; of Afghan proverbs in [[Dari Persian|Dari]] and English, part of an effort of nationbuilding, followed by a volume of [[Pashto]] proverbs in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Zellem. 2014.

===Cultural values===
[[File:Study proverb.PNG|thumb|250x|Chinese proverb. It says, "Learn till old, live till old, and there is still three-tenths not learned," meaning that no matter how old you are, there is still more learning or studying left to do.]]
[[File:Better a monk.JPG|thumb|Thai proverb depicted visually at a temple, "Better a monk"]]
There is a longstanding debate among proverb scholars as to whether the cultural values of specific language communities are reflected (to varying degree) in their proverbs. Many claim that the proverbs of a particular culture reflect the values of that specific culture, at least to some degree. Many writers have asserted that the proverbs of their cultures reflect their culture and values; this can be seen in such titles as the following: ''An introduction to Kasena society and culture through their proverbs'',&lt;ref&gt;Albert Kanlisi Awedoba.  2000. University Press Of America&lt;/ref&gt; Prejudice, power, and poverty in Haiti: a study of a nation's culture as seen through its proverbs,&lt;ref&gt;Linda Tavernier-Almada. 1999. Prejudice, power, and poverty in Haiti: a study of a nation's culture as seen through its proverbs.

Understanding culture through proverbs. University of Amsterdam MA thesis. [http://dare.uva.nl/cgi/arno/show.cgi?fid=346423 Online access]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a number of scholars argue that such claims are not valid. They have used a variety of arguments. Grauberg argues that since many proverbs are so widely circulated they are reflections of broad human experience, not any one culture's unique viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Grauberg. 1989. Proverbs and idioms: mirrors of national experience? ''Lexicographers and their works'', ed. by Gregory James, 94-99. Exeter: University of Exeter.&lt;/ref&gt; Related to this line of argument, from a collection of 199 American proverbs, Jente showed that only 10 were coined in the USA, so that most of these proverbs would not reflect uniquely American values.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jente. 1931-1932. The American Proverb. ''American Speech'' 7:342-348.&lt;/ref&gt; Giving another line of reasoning that proverbs should not be trusted as a simplistic guide to cultural values, Mieder once observed "proverbs come and go, that is, antiquated proverbs with messages and images we no longer relate to are dropped from our proverb repertoire, while new proverbs are created to reflect the mores and values of our time",&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. ''Proverbs are never out of season: Popular wisdom in the modern age''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; so old proverbs still in circulation might reflect past values of a culture more than its current values. Also, within any language's proverb repertoire, there may be "counter proverbs", proverbs that contradict each other on the surface&lt;ref name="Charles Clay Doyle 2012"/&gt; (see section above). When examining such counter proverbs, it is difficult to discern an underlying cultural value. With so many barriers to a simple calculation of values directly from proverbs, some feel "one cannot draw conclusions about values of speakers simply from the texts of proverbs".&lt;ref&gt;p. 261. Sw. Anand Prahlad. 1996. ''African American Proverbs in Context''. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many outsiders have studied proverbs to discern and understand cultural values and world view of cultural communities.&lt;ref&gt;Niemeyer, Larry L., "Proverbs : tools for world view studies : an exploratory comparison of the Bemba of Zambia and the Shona of Zimbabwe" (1982). Dissertations and Theses. Paper 886. http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/open_access_etds/886&lt;/ref&gt; These outsider scholars are confident that they have gained insights into the local cultures by studying proverbs, but this is not universally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jente. 1931-1932. The American Proverb. ''American Speech'' 7:342-348.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grauberg, Walter. 1989. Proverbs and idioms: mirrors of national experience? In ''Lexicographers and their works'', ed. by Gregory James, 94-99. Exeter: University of Exeter.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Whiting, Bartlett J. 1994.

Seeking empirical evidence to evaluate the question of whether proverbs reflect a culture's values, some have counted the proverbs that support various values. For example, Moon lists what he sees as the top ten core cultural values of the [[Builsa]] society of Ghana, as exemplified by proverbs. He found that 18% of the proverbs he analyzed supported the value of being a member of the community, rather than being independent.&lt;ref&gt;p. 134. W. Jay Moon. 2009. ''African Proverbs Reveal Christianity in Culture: A Narrative Portrayal of Builsa Proverbs''. Eugene, OR: Pickwick Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This was corroboration to other evidence that collective community membership is an important value among the Builsa. In studying Tajik proverbs, Bell notes that the proverbs in his corpus "Consistently illustrate Tajik values" and "The most often observed proverbs reflect the focal and specific values" discerned in the thesis.&lt;ref&gt;p. 139 &amp; 157. Evan Bell. 2009. ''An analysis of Tajik proverbs''. Masters thesis, Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of English proverbs created since 1900 showed in the 1960s a sudden and significant increase in proverbs that reflected more casual attitudes toward sex.&lt;ref&gt;p. 120. Peter Unseth. Review of ''Dictionary of Modern Proverbs''. ''American Speech'' 90.1:117-121.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s was also the decade of the [[Sexual revolution]], this shows a strong statistical link between the changed values of the decades and a change in the proverbs coined and used. Another study mining the same volume counted Anglo-American proverbs about religion to show that proverbs indicate attitudes toward religion are going downhill.&lt;ref&gt;Petrova, Roumyana. 2016. How Religious Are The Modern Anglo-American Proverbs: A Linguocultural Study. ''Proceedings of the world congress of the IASS/AIS'', Editor in Chief: Kristian Bankov.  ISSN 2414-6862. [http://www.iass-ais.org/proceedings2014/view_lesson.php?id=81 Web access]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many examples where cultural values have been explained and illustrated by proverbs. For example, from India, the concept that birth determines one's nature "is illustrated in the oft-repeated proverb: there can be no friendship between grass-eaters and meat-eaters, between a food and its eater".&lt;ref&gt;p. 22, [[Patrick Olivelle]]. 2013. Talking Animals: Explorations in an Indian Literary Genre. ''Religions of South Asia'' 7.14-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Proverbs have been used to explain and illustrate the [[Fula people|Fulani]] cultural value of ''pulaaku''.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Leger and Abubakar B. Mohammad. 2000. The concept of pulaaku mirrored in Fulfulde proverbs of the Gombe dialect. ''Berichte des Sonderforschungsbereichs 268, Band 14, Frankfurt a.M. 2000: 299-306.&lt;/ref&gt; But using proverbs to ''illustrate'' a cultural value is not the same as using a collection of proverbs to ''discern'' cultural values. In a comparative study between Spanish and Jordanian proverbs it is defined the social imagination for the mother as an archetype in the context of role transformation and in contrast with the roles of husband, son and brother, in two societies which might be occasionally associated with sexist and /or rural ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;Sbaihat, Ahlam (2012). La imagen de la madre en el refranero español y jordano. Estudio de Paremiología comparada. España: Sociedad Española de Estudios Literarios de Cultura Popular, Oceanide, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have adopted a cautious approach, acknowledging at least a genuine, though limited, link between cultural values and proverbs: "The cultural portrait painted by proverbs may be fragmented, contradictory, or otherwise at variance with reality... but must be regarded not as accurate renderings but rather as tantalizing shadows of the culture which spawned them."&lt;ref&gt;p. 173.Sheila K.  Webster. 1982. Women, Sex, and Marriage in Moroccan Proverbs. ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' 14:173-184.&lt;/ref&gt; There is not yet agreement on the issue of whether, and how much, cultural values are reflected in a culture's proverbs.

It is clear that the Soviet Union believed that proverbs had a direct link to the values of a culture, as they used them to try to create changes in the values of cultures within their sphere of domination. Sometimes they took old Russian proverbs and altered them into socialist forms.&lt;ref&gt;p. 84ff. Andrey Reznikov. 2009. ''Old wine in new bottles: Modern Russian anti-proverbs.'' (Supplement Series of ''Proverbium'', 27.) Burlington, VT: University of Vermont&lt;/ref&gt; These new proverbs promoted Socialism and its attendant values, such as atheism and collectivism, e.g. "Bread is given to us not by Christ, but by machines and collective farms" and "A good harvest is had only by a collective farm." They did not limit their efforts to Russian, but also produced "newly coined proverbs that conformed to socialist thought" in Tajik and other languages of the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;Evan Bell. 2009. ''An analysis of Tajik proverbs''. Masters thesis, Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Proverb scroll.PNG|thumb|left|Scroll of the Biblical [[Book of Proverbs]]]]

===Religion===
Many proverbs from around the world address matters of ethics and expected of behavior. Therefore, it is not surprising that proverbs are often important texts in religions. The most obvious example is the [[Book of Proverbs]] in the Bible. Additional proverbs have also been coined to support religious values, such as the following from [[Dari Persian|Dari]] of Afghanistan:&lt;ref&gt;p. 54, J. Christy Wilson, Jr. 2004. ''One hundred Afghan Persian proverbs'' 3rd, edition. Peshawar, Pakistan: InterLit Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; "In childhood you're playful, In youth you're lustful, In old age you're feeble, So when will you before God be worshipful?"

Clearly proverbs in religion are not limited to monotheists; among the Badaga of India (Sahivite Hindus), there is a traditional proverb "Catch hold of and join with the man who has placed sacred ash [on himself]."&lt;ref&gt;p. 601, Paul Hockings. 1988. ''Counsel from the Ancients: A study of Badaga proverbs, prayers, omens and curses''. Berlin: de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs are widely associated with large religions that draw from sacred books, but they are also used for religious purposes among groups with their own traditional religions, such as the Guji Oromo.&lt;ref name="Tadesse Jaleta Jirata 2009"/&gt; The broadest comparative study of proverbs across religions is ''The eleven religions and their proverbial lore, a comparative study. A reference book to the eleven surviving major religions of the world'' by Selwyn Gurney Champion, from 1945. Some sayings from sacred books also become proverbs, even if they were not obviously proverbs in the original passage of the sacred book.&lt;ref&gt;Ziyad Mohammad Gogazeh and Ahmad Husein Al-Afif. 2007. Los proverbios árabes extraidos del ''Corán'': recopilación, traducción,  y estudio. ''Paremia'' 16: 129-138.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many quote "Be sure your sin will find you out" as a proverb from the Bible, but there is no evidence it was proverbial in its original usage ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 32:23).

Not all religious references in proverbs are positive, some are cynical, such as the Tajik, "Do as the mullah says, not as he does."&lt;ref&gt;p. 130, Evan Bell. 2009. ''The wit and wisdom of the Tajiks: An analysis of Tajik proverbs''. Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics, MA thesis.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, note the Italian proverb, "One barrel of wine can work more miracles than a church full of saints". An Indian proverb is cynical about devotees of Hinduism, "[Only] When in distress, a man calls on Rama".&lt;ref&gt;p. 16, P. R. Gurdon. 1895. ''Some Assamese proverbs.'' Shillong, India: Assam Secretariat Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of Tibetan Buddhism, some Ladakhi proverbs mock the lamas, e.g. "If the lama's own head does not come out cleanly, how will he do the drawing upwards of the dead?... used for deriding the immoral life of the lamas."&lt;ref&gt;p. 142. August Francke. 1901. A collection of Ladakhi proverbs. ''Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'' 2: 135-148.&lt;/ref&gt; Proverbs do not have to explicitly mention religion or religious figures to be used to mock a religion, seen in the fact that in a collection of 555 proverbs from the [[Lur people|Lur]], a Muslim group in Iran, the explanations for 15 of them use illustrations that mock Muslim clerics.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Unseth (2017). Review of ''Warm Hearts and Sharp Tongues: Life in 555 Proverbs from the Zagros Mountains of Iran''. ''Iranian Studies'' 50:1, 163-167, DOI:10.1080/00210862.2017.1269451&lt;/ref&gt;

Dammann thought "The influence of Islam manifests itself in African proverbs... Christian influences, on the contrary, are rare."&lt;ref&gt;p. 46. Ernst Dammann. 1972. Die Religion in Afrikanischen Sprichwörter und Rätseln. ''Anthropos'' 67:36-48. Quotation in English, from summary at end of article.&lt;/ref&gt;  If widely true in Africa, this is likely due to the longer presence of Islam in many parts of Africa. Reflection of Christian values is common in Amharic proverbs of Ethiopia, an area that has had a presence of Christianity for well over 1,000 years. The Islamic proverbial reproduction may also be shown in the image of some animals such as the dog. Although dog is portrayed in many European proverbs as the most faithful friend of man, it is represented in some Islamic countries as impure, dirty, vile, cowardly, ungrateful and treacherous, in addition to links to negative human superstitions such as loneliness, indifference and bad luck.&lt;ref&gt;Sharab, Moayad; Sbaihat, Ahlam; Al Duweiri, Hussein (2013).

===Psychology===
Though much proverb scholarship is done by literary scholars, those studying the human mind have used proverbs in a variety of studies.&lt;ref&gt;Mieder, Wolfgang. "The use of proverbs in psychological testing." ''Journal of the Folklore Institute'' 15.1 (1978): 45-55.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest studies in this field is the ''Proverbs Test'' by Gorham, developed in 1956. A similar test is being prepared in German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/neuropsy/testsE/sprichwort.html |title=Institut für Kognitive Neurowissenschaft |publisher=Ruhr-uni-bochum.de |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proverbs have been used to evaluate [[dementia]],&lt;ref&gt;Yamaguchi, Haruyasu; Yohko Maki, Tomoharu Yamaguchi. 2011.

==Paremiology==
{{main article|Paremiology}}
The study of proverbs is called '''paremiology''' which has a variety of uses in the study of such topics as [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]], and [[folklore]]. There are several types and styles of proverbs which are analyzed within Paremiology as is the use and misuse of familiar expressions which are not strictly 'proverbial' in the dictionary definition of being fixed sentences

===Paremiological minimum===
Grigorii Permjakov&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.arnes.si/~bridges/proverb_wisdom.htm|title=Photo and Web page about Permjakov|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed the concept of the core set of proverbs that full members of society know, what he called the "paremiological minimum" (1979). For example, an adult American is expected to be familiar with "Birds of a feather flock together", part of the American paremiological minimum. However, an average adult American is not expected to know "Fair in the cradle, foul in the saddle", an old English proverb that is not part of the current American paremiological minimum. Thinking more widely than merely proverbs, Permjakov observed "every adult Russian language speaker (over 20 years of age) knows no fewer than 800 proverbs, proverbial expressions, popular literary quotations and other forms of cliches".&lt;ref&gt;p. 91 Grigorii L'vovich Permiakov. 1989.

===Sources for proverb study===
[[File:Books on proverb study.jpg|thumb|A sample of books used in the study of proverbs.]]

A seminal work in the study of proverbs is Archer Taylor's ''The Proverb'' (1931), later republished by [[Wolfgang Mieder]] with Taylor's Index included (1985/1934). A good introduction to the study of proverbs is Mieder's 2004 volume, ''Proverbs: A Handbook''. Mieder has also published a series of bibliography volumes on proverb research, as well as a large number of articles and other books in the field. Stan Nussbaum has edited a large collection on proverbs of Africa, published on a CD, including reprints of out-of-print collections, original collections, and works on analysis, bibliography, and application of proverbs to Christian ministry (1998).&lt;ref&gt;Mbiti, John. 2002. The African proverbs project and after. ''Lexikos'', 12(1): 256-263.&lt;/ref&gt; Paczolay has compared proverbs across Europe and published a collection of similar proverbs in 55 languages (1997). Mieder edits an academic journal of proverb study, ''[[Proverbium (journal)|Proverbium]]'' ({{ISSN|0743-782X}}), many back issues of which are available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://https//catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006930797|title=Proverbium.|first1=|last1=Universiṭah ha-ʻIvrit bi-Yerushalayim.|first2=|last2=University of Vermont.|first3=|last3=Ohio State University.|date=29 November 1984|publisher=|pages=v.|via=Hathi Trust}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A volume containing articles on a wide variety of topics touching on proverbs was edited by Mieder and [[Alan Dundes]] (1994/1981). ''Paremia'' is a Spanish-language journal on proverbs, with articles available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/paremia/ Web access to ''Paremia'']&lt;/ref&gt; There are also papers on proverbs published in conference proceedings volumes from the annual Interdisciplinary Colloquium on Proverbs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colloquium-proverbs.org/icp/en/ |title=Conference website |publisher=Colloquium-proverbs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Tavira Municipality|Tavira]], Portugal. Mieder has published a two-volume ''International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology'', with a topical, language, and author index.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Mieder. 2008. ''International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology''. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; Mieder has published a bibliography of collections of proverbs from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Mieder, Wolfgang. 2011. ''International Bibliography of Paremiography''. (Supplement Series of Proverbium, 34.) Burlington, VT: University of Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt; A broad introduction to proverb study, ''Introduction to Paremiology'', edited by Hrisztalina Hrisztova-Gotthardt and Melita Aleksa Varga has been published in both hardcover and free open access, with articles by a dozen different authors.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Paremiology.

===Noteworthy proverb scholars (paremiologists and paremiographers)===
The study of proverbs has been built by a number of notable scholars and contributors. Earlier scholars were more concerned with collecting than analyzing. [[Desiderius Erasmus]] was a Latin scholar (1466 – 1536), whose collection of Latin proverbs, known as ''[[Adagia]]'', spread Latin proverbs across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Erasmus, Desiderius. Adages in Collected Works of Erasmus. Trans. R.A.B Mynors et al. Volumes 31–36. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1982–2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juan de Mal Lara]] was a 16th century Spanish scholar, one of his books being 1568 ''Philosophia vulgar'', the first part of which contains one thousand and one sayings.

From the 20th century onwards, proverb scholars were involved in not only collecting proverbs, but also analyzing and comparing proverbs. [[Alan Dundes]] was a 20th century American folklorist whose scholarly output on proverbs led Wolfgang Mieder to refer to him as a “pioneering paremiologist”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol35/mieder.pdf|title=Alan Dundes as Pioneering Paremiologist.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matti Kuusi]] was a 20th century Finnish paremiologist, the creator of the Matti Kuusi international type system of proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Lauhakangas, Outi. 2013. The Matti Kuusi International Database of Proverbs. ''Oral Tradition'' 28/2 (2013): 217–222. ([http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/28ii/06_28.2.pdf Article on his Proverb Type System.])&lt;/ref&gt; With encouragement from [[Archer Taylor]],&lt;ref&gt;Lauhakangas, Outi. 2014. Categorization of proverbs, p. 59. ''Introduction to Paremiology'', ed. by Hrisztalina Hrisztova-Gotthardt and Melita Aleksa Varga, pp. 49–67. Berlin: de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; he founded the journal ''Proverbium: Bulletin d'Information sur les Recherches Parémiologiques'', published from 1965 to 1975 by the Society for Finnish Literature, which was later restarted as ''[[Proverbium (journal)|Proverbium: International Yearbook of Proverb Scholarship]]''. Archer Taylor was a 20th century American scholar, best known for his "magisterial"&lt;ref&gt;p. xiv, Mieder, Wolfgang. ''Proverbs: A handbook''. Westport, CT: Grenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; book ''The Proverb''.&lt;ref&gt;1931. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dimitrios Loukatos]] was a 20th century Greek proverb scholar, author of such works as ''Aetiological Tales of Modern Greek Proverbs''.&lt;ref&gt;''Aetiological Tales of Modern Greek Proverbs'' (Ermis: Athens, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arvo Krikmann]] (1939 – 2017) was an Estonian proverb scholar, whom Wolfgang Mieder called “one of the leading paremiologists in the world”&lt;ref&gt;p. vi. Wolfgang Mieder. 2009. Editor’s Preface. ''Proverb semantics: Studies in structure, logic, and metaphor'', edited by Wolfgang Mieder, pp. v-viii. (Supplement Series to ''Proverbium'', 29.) Burlington, VT: University of Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt; and “master folklorist and paremiologist”.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5. Wolfgang Mieder. Arvo Krikmann: Master folklorist and paremiologist. ''Proverbium'' 31: 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elisabeth Piirainen]] was a German scholar with 50 proverb-related publications.&lt;ref&gt;p. 640-646. Wolfgang Mieder. 2009 ''International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology''. Berlin: de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Current proverb scholars have continued the trend to be involved in analysis as well as collection of proverbs. [[Claude Buridant]] is a century French scholar whose work has concentrated on [[Romance languages]].&lt;ref&gt;1976. Nature and function of proverbs in jeux-partis. ''Revue des sciences humaines'' 163.3 (1976): 377-418.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Galit Hasan-Rokem]] is an Israeli scholar, associate editor of ''Proverbium: The yearbook of international proverb scholarship'', since 1984. She has written on proverbs in Jewish traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hasan-Rokem, Galit. Web of life: Folklore and Midrash in Rabbinic literature. Stanford University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph G. Healey]] is an American Catholic missionary in Kenya who has led a movement to sponsor African proverb scholars to collect proverbs from their own language communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afriprov.org/index.php/meetings/624-minutes-of-the-meeting-of-the-african-proverbs-working-group-saturday-28-april-2012-.html ''Minutes of the Meeting of the African Proverbs Working Group,'' ''Christ the Teacher Parish, Kenyatta University'' Nairobi, Kenya, Saturday, 28 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This led Wolfgang Mieder to dedicate the "International Bibliography of New and Reprinted Proverb Collections" section of ''Proverbium'' 32 to Healey.&lt;ref&gt;p. 457. International Bibliography of New and Reprinted Proverb Collections. ''Proverbium'' 32: 457-466.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett]] is a scholar of Jewish history and folklore, including proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, Barbara. "Toward a theory of proverb meaning." ''Proverbium'' 22 (1973): 821-827.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Wolfgang Mieder]] is a German-born proverb scholar who has worked his entire academic career in the USA. He is the editor of ‘’Proverbium’’ and the author of the two volume ''International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology''.&lt;ref&gt;2009 ''International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology''.

[[Avant-garde]] art and American pop culture have had an intriguing relationship from the time of the art form's inception in America to the current day. The art form, which began in the early half of the nineteenth century in [[Europe]],&lt;ref name = ABC&gt;{{Cite book|author=Crane, Diana|title=The Transformation of the Avant Garde: the New York Art World|publisher=University of Chicago|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; started to rise slowly in [[United States|America]] under the guise of [[Dadaism]] in 1915. While originally formed under a group of artists in [[New York City]] who wanted to counter [[popular culture|pop culture]] with their art, music, and literature the art form began to grow into prominence with American pop culture due to a variety of factors between the 1940s to the 1970s. However, from many factors that arose in the late 1970s, avant-garde began to both lessen in prominence and began to blend with the pop culture to the point in which most art critics considered the art form extinct.

== Avant Garde and Kitsch ==
Though his first published essays dealt mainly with literature and theatre, art still held a powerful attraction for [[Clement Greenberg]], so in 1939, he made a sudden name as a visual art writer with possibly his most well-known and oft-quoted essay, "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]", first published in the journal ''[[Partisan Review]]''. In this Marxist-influenced essay, Greenberg claimed that true [[avant-garde]] art is a product of the Enlightenment's revolution of critical thinking, and as such resists and recoils from the degradation of culture in both mainstream capitalist and communist society, while acknowledging the paradox that, at the same time, the artist, dependent on the market or the state, remains inexorably attached ''"by an umbilical cord of gold"''. Kitsch, on the other hand, was the product of industrialization and the urbanization of the working class, a filler made for the consumption of the working class: a populace hungry for culture, but without the resources and education to enjoy cutting edge avant garde culture. Greenberg writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Kitsch, using for raw material the debased and academicized simulacra of genuine culture, welcomes and cultivates this insensibility. It is the source of its profits. Kitsch is mechanical and operates by formulas. Kitsch is vicarious experience and faked sensations. Kitsch changes according to style, but remains always the same. Kitsch is the epitome of all that is spurious in the life of our times. Kitsch pretends to demand nothing of its customers except their money – not even their time." &lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Clement. "Avant-Garde and Kitsch." [[Partisan Review]]. 6:5 (1939) 34–49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Greenberg, avant garde art was too "innocent" to be effectively used as propaganda or bent to a cause, while kitsch was ideal for stirring up false sentiment.

Greenberg appropriated the German word "[[kitsch]]" to describe this low, concocted form of "culture", though its [[connotation]]s have since been recast to a more affirmative acceptance of nostalgic materials of capitalist/communist culture. "Avant Garde and Kitsch" is clearly a politically motivated essay, in part a response to the destruction and repression of Modernist Art in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and represents a denouncement of the growing totalitarian threat in Europe and the "retrogression" of fascism.

==Further definition==
[[Avant-garde]], as sociologist Diana Crane states, “was an art-form that had started in Europe that had started in the early nineteenth century.” While the art form has survived for this long, she states that the concept of the art form is “highly ambiguous” and it has been through many phases throughout its existence, including [[Dadaism]], [[Abstract Expressionism]], [[Minimalism]], and [[pop art]]. Socially, however, each form of avant-garde is united with the idea that it is part of the definition of high culture, although this in itself is defined in a variety of fashions.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

===Ways to determine avant-garde===
Due to the ambiguity of the term, Crane gives a few considerations on what could be considered avant-garde and what is not. She states that avant-garde can be determined in its approach to the [[aesthetic]], through the social content of the artwork, and through the production and distribution of the artwork.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

===Aesthetics===
Through aesthetic, a piece of artwork can be determined avant-garde if it does any of the following:
* '''If the artwork redefines artistic conventions.'''
* '''If it utilizes new artistic tools and techniques.'''
* '''And if it redefines the nature of the art objects.'''

An example of the aesthetic used in Avant-garde can include the artwork of [[Marcel Duchamp]]. For Duchamp's ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', he simply took a urinal and defined this as a ready-made art form. In this, he redefined artistic conventions by taking an item that was already made and employing the item for an artistic purpose. By doing this, he also employed a new technique in the production of art by taking something that was already produced and redefined the object he was using by taking a urinal and using it for art.

===Through Social Content===
Through social content, a piece of artwork can be determined avant-garde if it does one of the  following:
*; If the artwork incorporates in its artworks social or political values that are critical of or different from the majority culture.
:For example, in ''The Art of Humanism: Art in a Time of Change'', Barry Schwartz states that one of the roles of avant-garde art was to provide a counter-cultural force in the art world.
*; If it redefines the relationship between high and popular culture
:Like pop artists using images from advertisements and comic strips to employ a different meaning to those images
*; And if it adopts a critical attitude toward artistic institutions
:This is seen by the Dadaist attack on the legitimacy of art

===Through production and distribution===
Through its production and distribution, an artwork can be described as avant-garde if it redefines the social context for the production of art, in terms of critics, role models, and the audience; if it does one of the following:

*; The artwork redefines the organizational context for the production, display, and distribution of art
:A good example of this is the usage of alternative spaces in order to make the art appear unsellable.
*; The artwork redefines the nature of the artistic role or the extent to which the artist participates in other social institutions, which provides a good niche of avant-garde artists in the middle class.

===Differences with Post-Modernism===
While the two terms are used interchangeably today, some argue that the difference between the two lie in their approach to innovating art. According to Jochen Schulte-Sasse,&lt;ref name = BCD&gt;{{Cite book|author=Büger, Peter|title=The Theory of the Avant-Garde|publisher=University of Minnesota|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; the two differ in the fact that [[Post-modernism]] wants to destroy old conceptions of art to replace them with new (without any reference to the social impact of the art). According to Diana Crane, post-modernists do this through a variety of ways, namely through creating effects of polysemy, ambiguity, and parody. Post-modernists also only focused on the technique of their art rather than the social impacts of their art. However, avant-garde wants to innovate art and also communicate social issues within it. It could also be defined that post-modernism uses their art with the intent to shock the person viewing the art while avant-garde, while it also often shocks the viewer, uses their art to communicate a message through the art while also using the art to shock the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Crane, Diana|title=Postmodernism and the Avant-Garde: Stylistic Change in Fashion Design|journal=Modernism/Modernity 4.3|year=1997}} pp.123-140&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subgenres of the avant-garde==
While avant-garde is a solitary art form, it has had a variety of subgenres attached to the art form throughout its history, with each communicating their own distinct messages. Some of them, like Dadaism and Pop Art, use the art to provide a social commentary.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; Others, like Abstract Expressionism, use outer-worldly figures and colors to evoke an emotional response.&lt;ref name = CDE&gt;Abstract Expressionism." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 14 Nov. 2010 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1963/Abstract-Expressionism&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, there are some like Minimalism&lt;ref name = FGH&gt;"minimalism." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 14 Nov. 2010 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; which use their art for the sake of making art without any emotional or social meanings behind them. While there are myriad different avant-garde subgenres that came about during its popularity in America, the four subgenres that played the biggest roles in American Popular Culture are Dadaism, Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, and Pop Art.

===Dadaism===
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|[[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''Fountain'' is an example of Dadaist [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|Ready-Mades]]]]
{{Main|Dada}}
Dadaism was the first major subgenre of avant-garde art to cross over into America. Dadaist artists, in many ways, wanted to contrast from the typical artist at the time from their idea of being against typical artistic conventions at the time and being anti-art. A good example of their anti-art approach came through what Dadaists call the “ready-mades,” the most notable being [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s Fountain, which was a porcelain urinal. Ready-mades such as this caused great debate in the art community concerning the definition of art and how Dadaists should play in this definition.&lt;ref name = DEF&gt;”Dada” Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 14 Nov. 2010 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/149499/Dada&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Commonalities Between Pieces====
While Dadaist pieces cannot be determined through a particular artistic form, many Dadaist artists collaborated in groups with each other in order to create their art, united on either to create art based on social issues (particularly in Europe) or to mock the art world in general (mostly in America). In America, the center of this movement came from two locations in the New York-area:  at Alfred Stieglitz’s New York gallery “291,” and at the studio of Walter Arensberg. In addition to group collaboration, artists of the Dada movement depended more on spontaneity and chance than following other established artists. They focused on rejecting the ideas formed by established artists and art creation and used methods such as collage, photomontage, and found-object construction to create their art. While this art form started strong in 1916 in Germany, it eventually faded out by 1922 in both Europe and America. However, despite its decline, Dada would play a major influence on other avant-garde and nihilistic art-forms in the future, including the Punk movement in the '1970s.&lt;ref name="DEF"/&gt;&lt;ref name = EFG&gt;{{Cite book|author=Marcus, Greil|title=Lipstick Traces: a Secret History of the Twentieth Century.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abstract Expressionism===
{{Main|Abstract Expressionism}}
Abstract Expressionism was another major avant-garde genre that, unlike Dadaism, was born in and popular in the United States. A number of artists that were practitioners of this art form include [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]], and [[Mark Rothko]]. Much like Dadaism in America, the center of the movement was in New York City.&lt;ref name="CDE"/&gt;

====Commonalities====
Also, much like Dadaism, although many of the artists worked together in creating their art, the art pieces cannot be determined through one particular art form. Pieces often varied differently between painting styles from both the techniques that were used in the piece and quality of expression of the pieces.  Despite the drastic differences between pieces, Abstract Expressionism shares several broad characteristics.  These characteristics includes:

* Each piece depicts forms that are not found in the visible world
* Each emphasize free, spontaneous, and personal emotional expressionism
* They exercise a freedom of technique with emphasis on exploitation of the physical character of the paint to evoke expressive qualities (violence, lyricism, etc.)
* They show similar emphasis on the unstudied and intuitive application of that paint in a form of psychic improvisation akin to the automatism of the Surrealists, with a similar intent of expressing the force of the creative unconscious in art.
* They display the abandonment of conventionally structured composition built up out of discrete and segregable elements and their replacement with a single unified, undifferentiated field, network, or other image that exists in unstructured space.
* Finally, the paintings fill large canvases to give these aforementioned visual effects both monumentality and engrossing power.

There are also three main techniques in which categorize Abstract Expressionism. First, there is [[Action Painting]], which is characterized by a loose, rapid, dynamic, or forceful handling of paint in sweeping or slashing brush strokes and in techniques partially dictated by chance, such as dripping or spilling the paint directly onto the canvas. Examples of this include Jackson Pollock dripping commercial paints on raw canvas to build up complex and tangled skeins of paint into exciting and suggestive linear patterns and Willem de Kooning used extremely vigorous and expressive brush strokes to build up richly colored and textured images. The second category of Abstract Expressionism is represented by a variety of styles ranging from [[Color field]], to [[Lyrical abstraction]]; delicate imagery and fluid shapes and fields of color included in works by [[Clyfford Still]], [[Philip Guston]], and [[Helen Frankenthaler]] to the more clearly structured, forceful, almost calligraphic pictures of [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Adolph Gottlieb]]. Finally, the last form of Abstract Expressionism is the third and least emotionally expressive approach was that of Rothko, [[Barnett Newman]], and [[Ad Reinhardt]]. These painters used large areas, or fields, of flat colour and thin, diaphanous paint to achieve quiet, subtle, almost meditative effects. While Abstract Expressionism's roots could be traced back as far as 1919, the peak of its popularity were in the 1950s to the 1960s.  This, like Dadaism before, shows another influential avant-grade artistic genre that suffered from a short peak of popularity.&lt;ref name="CDE"/&gt;

===Minimalism===
{{Main|Minimalism}}
Minimalism was an avant-grade genre from the 1910s to the late 1960s which was characterized by extreme simplicity of a form and a literal approach. Its origins could be stemmed from many artists, including Kandinsky, Picabia, Delaunay, Kupka, Survage and Malevich, who focused on reducing art to its basic element. A great example of his art was the painting of a black square on a white ground. Other minimalist artists that were famous at this time included painters such as Jack Youngerman, Ellsworth Kelly, Frank Stella, Kenneth Noland, Al Held, and Gene Davis  and sculptors such as  Donald Judd, Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Tony Smith, Anthony Caro, and Sol LeWitt.&lt;ref name="FGH"/&gt; [[File:Black Square.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kazimir Malevich]], Black Square, 1923, oil on canvas, State [[Russian Museum]], St.Petersburg]]

In many ways the rise of Minimalism came as a result of those who were dissatisfied with the Abstract Expressionist movement, primarily from the Action Paintings of the movement. The reason for many was that they believed that Action painting was too personal and insubstantial, and they adopted the point of view that a work of art should not refer to anything other than itself.&lt;ref name="FGH"/&gt;

====Similarities====
Unlike other genres of avant-garde at the time, minimalist art used not only a set of philosophical properties when it came to the production of their In order to rid their art of any extra-visual influence, Minimalist paintings used hard edge painting, a simplistic form, and a linear approach to emphasize two-dimensionality and to allow the viewer an immediate, purely visual response to art in comparison to any other sort of response.&lt;ref name="FGH"/&gt;

===Hard-Edge Painting===
{{Main|Hard-Edge Painting}}
Hard-edge painting is characterized by large, simplified, usually geometric forms on an overall flat surface; precise, razor-sharp contours; and broad areas of bright, unmodulated color that have been stained into unprimed canvas. It differs from other types of geometric abstraction in that it rejects both lyrical and mathematical composition because, even in this simplified field, they are a means of personal expression for the artist. Minimal hard-edge painting is the anonymous construction of a simple object. (Make a reference to the part of the encyclopedia entry that this came from)&lt;ref name="FGH"/&gt;

====Similarities between Minimalist Sculpture====
Much like minimalist painting, minimalist sculpture used extremely simple, monumental geometric forms made of fiberglass, plastic, sheet metal, or aluminum, either left raw or solidly painted with bright industrial color in order to convey the art for the usage of the visual response without allowing the art to create responses elsewhere. An example of Minimalist Sculpture is “Free Ride” by Tony Smith, which is a black geometrical structure the size of a door opening on a white background.&lt;ref name="FGH"/&gt;

===Pop Art===
{{Main|Pop Art}}

One of the last major avant-garde artforms that proved to be very influential to the American pop culture was Pop Art. This art form had much of its roots in Great Britain in the early 1950s, but made its way into the American culture by the late 1950s and remained a popular art form in America from the 1960s. Some of the famous practitioners of this era include Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and Claes Oldenburg.&lt;ref name = GHI&gt;"Pop art." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 14 Nov. 2010 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469967/Pop-art&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Similarities====
Pop art, also like minimalism, has clear commonalities between their pieces. Primarily, each piece uses commonplace items (comic strips, soup cans, road signs, and hamburgers) as the subject matter of their pieces. They emphatically present any iconography that has created a major impact on contemporary life without praise or condemnation but with overwhelming immediacy, and by means of the precise commercial techniques used by the media from which the iconography itself was borrowed. It was also an attempt to return to a more objective, universally acceptable form of art after the dominance in both the United States and Europe of the highly personal Abstract Expressionism. It was also iconoclastic, rejecting both the supremacy of the “high art” of the past and the pretensions of other contemporary avant-garde art. Pop art became a cultural event because of its close reflection of a particular social situation and because its easily comprehensible images were immediately exploited by the mass media. Despite its opposition to other avant-garde art forms at its time, Pop art was a derivative of Dada, especially praising the art of  Marcel Duchamp, who with his “ready-mades” also praised many objects and imagery of American pop culture.&lt;ref name="GHI"/&gt;

==Relationship Before the 1940's==
Before World War II there were some significant artists and art movements in the United States, but, according to sociologist Diana Crane, these art movements never were directly inspired by art movements from Europe. However, due to the numbers of immigrants from Europe who were involved with the avant-garde movement in Europe, Dadaist artists from Europe like Marcel Duchamp moved to America carrying their avant-garde ideals with them. Once they arrived in New York City, many of these Dadaists decided to collaborate, making art to display to the public.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

Initially, while the Dadaists brought some attention to the New York art scene, they had very little attention outside of it. Some factors that played to the lack of attention of the Dadaists at the time included the lack of museums throughout the United States and the lack of funding to the artists who created and advertised the art.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

===Origins of European avant-garde===
According to Peter Burger, some of the theories involving aesthetics can come all the way back to the writings of Karl Marx. According to Burger, “ For Marx, this development is not merely one in economic theory. Rather, he feels that the possibility of a progress in knowledge is a function of the development of the object toward which insight directs itself... Marx demonstrates through the example of the category of labor also applies to objectifications in the arts... it is only with aestheticism that the full unfolding of the phenomenon of art became a fact, and it is to aestheticism that the historical avant-garde movements respond” &lt;ref name="BCD"/&gt;

Besides from the idea of Karl Marx's influence over the avant-garde movement, much of the movement came through social commentary from the wars that were fought during the time of its rise. Dadaism, for instance, was seized upon by the group as appropriate for their anti-aesthetic creations and protest activities, which were engendered by disgust for bourgeois values and despair over World War I. Another example of this is John Hartfield's usage of photomontage to express his anti-Nazi views.&lt;ref name="DEF"/&gt;

===Relationship between the 1950s and 1980s===
As previously stated, as soon as many of the Dadaist movement from Europe immigrated over to the United States in the 1920s, they started making their art and presenting the art to the people of New York. Although it didn't initially take off, by the 1950s, their art and the art from artists that were inspired by these individuals began to rise in popularity.&lt;ref name="CDE"/&gt;

There were a number of factors that lead to the rise of avant-garde art in the eyes of the American Popular Culture. First of all, due to the rise of the American Economy after World War II, the American  Government focused on enhancing the importance of the Fine Arts. To do so, congress passed bills in which expanded the number of museums around the nation and funded the government to allow the artists to produce more art.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

===Increasing the Museums===
Before the 1940s, Americans in many regions were unaware to the existence of avant-garde art because, according to Dore Ashton, “Although culture... had penetrated the hinterland in the form of public libraries, literary societies, and even music circles, the plastic arts had... lagged far behind” In order to increase the interest of the arts among the people and to allow them to be up-to-date with the rest of the world at that time, they decided to increase the number of museums in America from the 1940s to the 1980s.&lt;ref name = HIJ&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ashton, Dore|title=The New York School: A Cultural Reckoning.|publisher=Viking|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government Funding the Artist===
Along with the construction of museums, the Federal Government also realized that, to increase the interest of the people, there needed to be more art available. In addition to this, if the artists were to do so, they would need to form communities in which the artists could gather to produce their art. According to Sharon Zukin, “...real-estate developers profited from the increase in property values that resulted from the creation of an artistic community in Manhattan's SoHo district while political leaders benefited from the creation of a large pool of arts-related jobs.” Another reason the Federal Government felt a need to fund the artists at this time was to increase the patriotism of the people. If there was art depicting how grand, majestic, and free the United States of America is, they felt this would increase Patriotism among the people so the people would be willing to agree with whatever the government had to offer. According to Sharon Zukin, “The willingness of federal and state governments to fund art and artists were political interests that used traveling exhibitions as propaganda for the American way of life.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;&lt;ref name = IJK&gt;{{Cite book|author=Zukin, Sharon|title=Loft Living: Culture and Capital in Urban Change.|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The influence of early avant-garde on later avant-garde===
When looking at all of the major movements of avant-garde that were influential from this time period, almost all of these art forms trace back to earlier avant-garde art forms, namely Dadaism. For instance, in practice, Abstract Expressionism was influenced by Dada by the fact that the art form had its similarities not in the way that the art was constructed, but rather from the concept that the genres exemplify. Pop Art also marks its influences from Dada because, like the “ready-mades” which used commonplace items in a way that they were not originally intended. For the case of Dada, the “ready-mades” consisted of items such as toilets as art. For the case of pop art, it could have been anything that proved influential in popular culture, whether it be comic strips, soup cans, or magazine advertisements.&lt;ref name="DEF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GHI"/&gt;

Another example of how an earlier avant-garde genre influenced a later genre was the example of Dada's influence of Punk fashion in the 1970s. Much like how the Dadaists used their art to reflect the ideal of  the belief in nothing and the wish to become nothing through their art (as they often referred it as anti-art), the Punk culture used the same ideals for their fashion and their music (by describing their music as anti-music). In addition to the two matching the same ideal, both used their mediums to reflect the same approach: to shock the community through their art and to speak a political, often Marxist, message through their works.&lt;ref name="EFG"/&gt;

===Relationship Between high culture and popular culture===
Stemming from its Dadaist beginnings, avant-garde was a movement that served as a contrast from typical Popular Culture. Under the guise of Dada, it started in Europe as a way to display their anti-art rhetoric as well as to communicate to the public their disgust for bourgeois values and their disapproval of World War I. In America, while the art was not much about protesting bourgeois values and the war, it still served as a way to protest against typical art values as well as to establish the high, artistic culture to contrast American popular culture.&lt;ref name = DEF&gt;”Dada” Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 14 Nov. 2010 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/149499/Dada&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Abstract Expressionist and Minimalist art also served as a way to contrast popular culture. In Abstract Expressionist art, the approach to contrast from the depiction of real-world qualities by creating art using forms that do not exist in the real world. In Minimalist art, the approach was to contrast from the complicated works of the time, including those of fellow avant-garde genre Abstract Expressionism. Through this, the artist created their art with the sole intent of making art; not with a complicated political statement, not with a cultural reference, etc. It solely was art for art itself.&lt;ref name="CDE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FGH"/&gt;

However, Pop art and its practitioners, while continuing to do some contrast between high culture and popular culture, began to blur the two by using elements of popular culture and transforming those images in a way which were not the original intent of those elements, much like the ready-mades of the Dadaist artists before them. It sometimes came through subverting the images coloration, such as what Andy Warhol did with pictures of soup cans and actress Marilyn Monroe. In other times, it came through taking a comic strip out of its initial context and using that for a piece. However, despite trying to contrast the two, at many times many of the artists became celebrities in popular culture while practicing their contrast between that and the High Culture.&lt;ref name="GHI"/&gt;

==Avant-garde's demise==
After the end of the Pop Art movement, many art critics began to question the rising generation of artists who were influenced by the Pop artists shortly before, even to the point that some considered avant-garde dead. There are various reasons, but three primary indications for its demise are:[[File:Blinklv.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Blink-182 performing live in 2009.]]

# In their beginnings, the pop artists made a distinction between American Pop Culture and High Culture by changing the intent on items that provided a major impact on American society. However, as time went on, many of these same artists whose goals were to subvert well-known icons to fit their art became celebrities themselves. As a result, since many avant-garde artists who supported the High Culture began to be well known in Popular culture, the differences between the two cultures were becoming less distinguishable as time went on.&lt;ref name="GHI"/&gt;
# By the time the 1990s approached, the Punk movement began to be part of the American culture. Indications of this transition include the rise of punk-inspired grunge music provided by bands like Nirvana and the rise of pop-punk bands such as Green Day and Blink 182. As punk music began to increase in popularity by this time, the lyrics, fashion, and the music itself began to be saturated by Popular Culture until the point where most of its avant-garde influence seemed to be transparent.
# With the definition of high culture more vague than it was back in its inception, many artists attempted to create art that seemed similar to avant-garde, but rather than focusing on building up the High Culture, the art was rather made to create shock and to create art of the future. Such art that focused on shock and not about the social impact of the art were considered by art critics to be beginnings of Post-modernism.

In the [[geometry]] of [[tessellation]]s, a '''rep-tile''' or '''reptile''' is a shape that can be [[dissection (geometry)|dissected]] into smaller copies of the same shape. The term was coined as a [[pun]] on animal [[Reptilia|reptiles]] by the [[United States of America|American]] [[mathematician]] [[Solomon W. Golomb]], who used it to describe self-replicating tilings.{{sfnp|Gardner|2001}} In 2012 a generalization of rep-tiles called [[self-tiling tile set]]s was introduced by [[Lee Sallows]] in ''[[Mathematics Magazine]]''.{{sfnp|Sallows|2012}}

[[File:A selection of rep-tiles.gif|thumb|400px|right|A selection of rep-tiles, including the [[sphinx tiling|sphinx]], two fish and the 5-triangle]]

==Terminology==

A rep-tile is labelled rep-''n'' if the dissection uses ''n'' copies. Such a shape necessarily forms the [[prototile]] for a tiling of the plane, in many cases an [[aperiodic tiling]]. 
A rep-tile dissection using different sizes of the original shape is called an irregular rep-tile or irreptile. If the dissection uses ''n'' copies, the shape is said to be irrep-''n''. If all these sub-tiles are of different sizes then the tiling is additionally described as perfect. A shape that is rep-''n'' or irrep-''n'' is trivially also irrep-(''kn''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'') for any ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, by replacing the smallest tile in the rep-''n'' dissection by ''n'' even smaller tiles. The order of a shape, whether using rep-tiles or irrep-tiles is the smallest possible number of tiles which will suffice.

==Examples==
[[File:pinwheel 2.gif|250px|thumb|right|Defining an aperiodic tiling (the [[pinwheel tiling]]) by repeatedly dissecting and inflating a rep-tile.]]
Every [[square]], [[rectangle]], [[parallelogram]], [[rhombus]], or [[triangle]] is rep-4. The [[sphinx tiling|sphinx]] [[polyiamond|hexiamond]] (illustrated above) is rep-4 and rep-9, and is one of few known [[#Pentagonal rep-tiles|self-replicating pentagons]]. The [[Gosper curve#Properties|Gosper island]] is rep-7. The [[Koch snowflake]] is irrep-7: six small snowflakes of the same size, together with another snowflake with three times the area of the smaller ones, can combine to form a single larger snowflake.

A [[right triangle]] with side lengths in the ratio 1:2 is rep-5, and its rep-5 dissection forms the basis of the aperiodic [[pinwheel tiling]]. By [[Pythagoras' theorem]], the [[hypotenuse]], or sloping side of the rep-5 triangle, has a length of {{radic|5}}.

The international standard [[ISO 216]] defines sizes of paper sheets using the {{math|{{sqrt|2}}}}, in which the long side of a rectangular sheet of paper is the [[square root of two]] times the short side of the paper. Rectangles in this shape are rep-2. A rectangle (or parallelogram) is rep-''n'' if its [[aspect ratio]] is {{radic|''n''}}:1. An [[isosceles triangle|isosceles]] right triangle is also rep-2.

==Rep-tiles and symmetry==

Some rep-tiles, like the [[square]] and [[equilateral triangle]], are [[symmetry|symmetrical]] and remain identical when [[mirror reflection|reflected in a mirror]]. Others, like the [[sphinx tiling|sphinx]], are [[asymmetry|asymmetrical]] and exist in [[chirality|two distinct forms]] related by mirror-reflection. Dissection of the sphinx and some other asymmetric rep-tiles requires use of both the original shape and its mirror-image.

==Rep-tiles and polyforms==

Some rep-tiles are based on [[polyform]]s like [[polyiamond]]s and [[polyomino]]es, or shapes created by laying [[equilateral triangle]]s and [[square]]s edge-to-edge.

===Squares===

If a polyomino is rectifiable, that is, able to tile a [[rectangle]], then it will also be a rep-tile, because the rectangle will then tile a [[square]]. This can be seen clearly in the [[octomino]]es, which are created from eight squares. Two copies of some octominoes will tile a square; therefore these octominoes are also rep-16 rep-tiles.

[[File:Rep-tiles constructed from rectifiable octominoes.gif|thumb|350px|none|Rep-tiles based on rectifiable [[octomino]]es]]

Four copies of some [[nonomino]]es and [[polyking|nonakings]] will tile a square, therefore these [[polyform]]s are also rep-36 rep-tiles.

[[File:Nonominoes.gif|700px|thumb|none|Rep-tiles created from rectifiable [[nonomino]]es and [[polyking|9-polykings]] (nonakings)]]

===Equilateral triangles===

Similarly, if a [[polyiamond]] tiles an equilateral triangle, it will also be a rep-tile.

[[File:Equilateral triangle reptiles.gif|thumb|700px|none|Rep-tiles created from equilateral triangles]]

[[File:Equilateral triangle rocket.gif|thumb|none|A rocket-like rep-tile created from a dodeciamond, or twelve equilateral triangles laid edge-to-edge (and corner-to-corner)]]

===Right triangles===

A [[right triangle]] is a triangle containing one right angle of 90&amp;deg;. Two particular forms of right triangle have attracted the attention of rep-tile researchers, the 45°-90°-45° triangle and the 30°-60°-90° triangle.

====45°-90°-45° triangles====

Polyforms based on [[isosceles triangle|isosceles]] [[right triangle]]s, with sides in the ratio 1&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[[Square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]], are known as [[polyabolo]]s. An infinite number of them are rep-tiles. Indeed, the simplest of all rep-tiles is a single isosceles right triangle. It is rep-2 when divided by a single line bisecting the right angle to the [[hypotenuse]]. Rep-2 rep-tiles are also rep-2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; and the rep-4,8,16+ triangles yield further rep-tiles. These are found by discarding half of the sub-copies and permutating the remainder until they are [[mirror image|mirror-symmetrical]] within a right triangle. In other words, two copies will tile a right triangle. One of these new rep-tiles is reminiscent of the fish formed from three [[equilateral triangle]]s.

====30&amp;deg;-60&amp;deg;-90&amp;deg; triangles====

Polyforms based on 30&amp;deg;-60&amp;deg;-90&amp;deg; right triangles, with sides in the ratio 1&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[[Square root of 3|{{sqrt|3}}]]&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;2, are known as [[polydrafter]]s. Some are identical to [[polymino]]es and [[polyiamond]]s, others are distinct.&lt;ref name=polydrafters&gt;[http://www.recmath.org/PolyCur/drirrep/index.html Polydrafter Irreptiling]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiple and variant rep-tilings==

Many of the common rep-tiles are rep-{{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} for all positive integer values of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|n}}. In particular this is true for three [[trapezoid]]s including the one formed from three equilateral triangles, for three axis-parallel hexagons (the L-tromino, L-tetromino, and P-pentomino), and the sphinx hexiamond.{{sfnp|Niţică|2003}} In addition, many rep-tiles, particularly those with higher rep-''n'', can be self-tiled in different ways. For example, the rep-9 L-tetramino has at least fourteen different rep-tilings. The rep-9 sphinx hexiamond can also be tiled in different ways.

|}

==Rep-tiles with infinite sides==

{|
|- valign=top
[[File:Horned triangle or teragonic triangle.gif|thumb|Horned triangle or teragonic triangle]]
|} 

The most familiar rep-tiles are polygons with a finite number of sides, but some shapes with an infinite number of sides can also be rep-tiles. For example, the [[teragon|teragonic]] triangle, or horned triangle, is rep-4. It is also an example of a [[#Fractals as rep-tiles|fractal rep-tile]].

==Pentagonal rep-tiles==

Triangular and quadrilateral (four-sided) rep-tiles are common, but pentagonal rep-tiles are rare. For a long time, the [[sphinx tiling|sphinx]] was widely believed to be the only example known, but the [[Germany|German]]/[[New Zealand|New-Zealand]] mathematician [http://karlscherer.com Karl Scherer] and the American mathematician [[Sicherman dice|George Sicherman]] have found more examples, including a double-pyramid and an elongated version of the sphinx. These pentagonal rep-tiles are illustrated on the [http://www2.stetson.edu/~efriedma/mathmagic/1002.html Math Magic] pages overseen by the American mathematician [[Friedman number|Erich Friedman]].&lt;ref name=pentagonal&gt;[http://www2.stetson.edu/~efriedma/mathmagic/1002.html Math Magic, Problem of the Month (October 2002)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the sphinx and its extended versions are the only known pentagons that can be rep-tiled with equal copies.
See Clarke's [http://www.recmath.com/PolyPages/PolyPages/Reptiles.htm Reptile pages].

==Rep-tiles and fractals==

===Rep-tiles as fractals===

Rep-tiles can be used to create [[fractal]]s, or shapes that are [[self-similarity|self-similar]] at smaller and smaller scales. A rep-tile fractal is formed by subdividing the rep-tile, removing one or more copies of the subdivided shape, and then continuing [[recursion|recursively]]. For instance, the [[Sierpinski carpet]] is formed in this way from a rep-tiling of a square into 27 smaller squares, and the [[Sierpinski triangle]] is formed  from a rep-tiling of an equilateral triangle into four smaller triangles. When one sub-copy is discarded, a rep-4 L-[[triomino]] can be used to create four fractals, two of which are identical except for [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]].

| [[File:A fractal based on an L-triomino (rep-4)-3.gif|250px|thumb|right|A third fractal based on an L-triomino]]
|}

===Fractals as rep-tiles===

Because [[fractal]]s are self-similar on smaller and smaller scales, many are also self-tiling and are therefore rep-tiles. For example, the [[Sierpinski triangle]] is rep-3, tiled with three copies of itself, and the [[Sierpinski carpet]] is rep-8, tiled with eight copies of itself.

By construction, any fractal defined by an [[iterated function system]] of n contracting maps of the same ratio is rep-n.

| [[File:Dragon tiling dragon.svg|thumb|right|A dragon curve based on 4 smaller copies of a dragon curve]]
|}

==Infinite tiling==

Among regular polygons, only the triangle and square can be dissected into smaller equally sized copies of themselves. However, a regular [[hexagon]] can be dissected into six equilateral triangles, each of which can be dissected into a regular hexagon and three more equilateral triangles. This is the basis for an infinite [[tessellation|tiling]] of the hexagon with hexagons. The hexagon is therefore an [[Infinity symbol|irrep-&amp;infin;]] or irrep-infinity irreptile.

The '''Shinnecock Hills Summer School of Art''' was summer school of art in [[Shinnecock Hills, New York|Shinnecock Hills]], Long Island that existed from 1891 to 1902. The director was [[William Merritt Chase]]. The school was one of the first and most popular ''[[En plein air|plein air]]'' painting schools in America.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meisler |first1=Stanley |title=William Merritt Chase: Praised by critics, admired by colleagues and respected by students, the distinguished 19th-century artist produced paintings and pastels of gentle beauty |journal=Smithsonian/General OneFile |date=February 2001 |page=84 |url=http://link.galegroup.com.library.access.arlingtonva.us/apps/doc/A70653653/ITOF?u=arl_library&amp;sid=ITOF&amp;xid=337bb55e |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the time Chase was teaching at Shinnecock Hills he painted some of his most notable Impressionist landscapes. 

==History==
[[File:Chase teaching at the Shinnecock Hills Summer School of Art.jpg|193px|thumb|right|Chase teaching at the Shinnecock Hills Summer School of Art]]
Mrs. William Hoyt (Janet Ralston Chase Hoyt) was a New York philanthropist, developer, and artist.&lt;ref name="Schaffner"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schaffner |first1=Cynthia V. A. |last2=Zabar |first2=Lori |title=The Founding and Design  of William Merritt Chase’s  Shinnecock Hills Summer School  of Art and the Art Village |journal=Winterthur Portfolio |date=December 2010 |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=303–350 |doi=10.1086/657165}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a summer resident of [[Southampton, New York|Southampton, Long Island]] and had the desire to start a summer art school providing training in open air landscape painting. She asked Chase to teach at the school. At that time Chase was well-regarded as a painter and a teacher. Hoyt also approached fellow Southampton residents Mrs. [[Henry Kirke Porter]] (Annie de Gamp Perrot Hegeman Porter) and Samuel Longstreth Parrish to provide financial support. Porter and Parrish provided the land for a large studio.&lt;ref name="Atkinson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Atkinson |first1=D.

The first classes were taught in the summer of 1891 before any construction on the studio or the "Art Village". The school rented an old farmhouse and Chase lived at the Shinncock Inn. The students could stay in Samuel Parrish's home or rent rooms in the area. The first summer was a success. By the summer of 1892 there were more than 100 students enrolled&lt;ref name="Gallati"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gallati |first1=Barbara Dayer |title=William Merritt Chase |date=1995 |publisher=Abrams [u.a.] |location=New York, NY |isbn=0810940299 |page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio and several cottages were completed, and classes were held at the location where it would continue to operated until its closure in 1902.&lt;ref name="Schaffner"/&gt;

Chase taught for two days each week. On Mondays he would hold a studio critique, reviewing the student work from the previous week. On Tuesdays Chase would set up his easel in the Shinncock Hills and paint while providing instruction. Chase encouraged his students to paint in the bright light, omitting preliminary sketches, and matching the colors painted to those observed. Students spent the rest of the week working on their paintings, either outside in the dunes, or in the studio during inclement weather.&lt;ref name="Atkinson"/&gt; Classes were taught by other artists, for example [[Lydia Field Emmet]] taught beginning drawing.&lt;ref name="Schaffner"/&gt;

In 1897 the school made a change in the name and administration due to Chase severing his ties with the school's co-sponsor, the [[Brooklyn Museum|Brooklyn Institute]]. The name was changed to the '''Shinnecock School of Art for Men and Women'''. Chase became the president, with [[Charles Webster Hawthorne]] and {{ill|Douglas John Connah|de}} serving as administrators.&lt;ref name="Schaffner"/&gt;

From 1891 to 1902 about 1,000 students studied at the Shinnecock Hills Summer School of Art.&lt;ref name="Solon"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Solon |first1=Deborah Epstein |title=Art Colonies and American Impressionism |url=http://www.tfaoi.com/newsmu/nmus119f.htm |website=Traditional Fine Arts Organization |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was successful, but Chase returned to spending his summers in Europe and the school closed in 1902.&lt;ref name="Schaffner"/&gt;

[[File:Map of the Art Village Situated at Shinnecock Hills.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Map of the Art Village Situated at Shinnecock Hills]]
The Art Studio was at the northeastern edge of the property, built with an exterior of log slabs.. The interior was one large workspace, with a large 2-sided easel in the center of the room.&lt;ref name="Schaffner"/&gt; 

The "Art Village" had cottages that were built by the individual owners of the residential lots. They were built in a variety of rustic styles, including [[Colonial Revival Movement|Colonial Revival]] and early [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]], and mostly clad in natural shingles.  Several of the cottages were designed by former students [[Grosvenor Atterbury]] and [[Katharine Budd]]. The cottages were often rented out to students.&lt;ref name="Schaffner"/&gt; The "Art Village" was designated as a ''Hamlet Heritage Resource Area'' by the Southampton Town Board in 2012.&lt;ref name="TownofSouthampton"&gt;{{cite web |title=Resolution 2012-841 Item 6.43 |url=http://www.southamptontownny.gov/DocumentCenter/View/749/Resolution-2012-841-Item-643?bidId= |website=Town of Southampton |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few miles down the road a [[William Merritt Chase Homestead|summer home and studio]] were built for Chase and his family. They were designed by [[Stanford White]].&lt;ref name="Atkinson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Atkinson |first1=D.

==Location==
The Shinnecock Hills Summer School of Art was located on the south fork of Long Island, New York in Shinnecock Hills just west of Southampton. At the time the school was started, the 4,000 acres of Shinnecock Hills was being developed by the Long Island Improvement Company (LIIC) which was a subsidiary of the Long Island Railroad. The school was close to the [[Shinnecock Hills station]] located on the Sag Harbor branch of the Long Island Railroad, about three hours by rail from New York City. The LIIC sold the land for the studio to benefactors Porter and Parrish. The LIIC also sold the land for the adjacent 21 residential lots (the "Art Village") to private individuals, most of whom were associated with the school. The Hoyt family, the Parrish family, and Grosvenor Atterbury purchased multiple lots.&lt;ref name="Schaffner"/&gt;

'''Site-specific art''' is [[work of art|artwork]] created to exist in a certain place. Typically, the artist takes the location into account while planning and creating the artwork. Site-specific art is produced both by commercial artists, and independently, and can include some instances of work such as [[sculpture]], [[stencil graffiti]], [[rock balancing]], and other art forms. Installations can be in urban areas, remote natural settings, or underwater.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lataco.com/interview-rafael-schacter-author-amazing-new-book-world-atlas-street-art-graffiti/ http://www.lataco.com] Interview with Rafael Schacter, Author of ''The World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/books/review/city-as-canvas-and-the-world-atlas-of-street-art-and-graffiti.html https://www.nytimes.com] Aerosol Art.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filippominelli.com/project/silence-shapes/ http://www.filippominelli.com] Filippo Minelli "''Silence/Shapes''."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Schacter, author of "''The World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti''", September, 2013; {{ISBN|9780300199420}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynstreetart.com/theblog/2014/02/13/rafael-schacter-and-his-world-atlas-of-street-art-and-graffiti/ http://www.brooklynstreetart.com] Rafael Schacter and His "World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bANKhbe1Vg8 https://www.youtube] Gravity Glue 2015; (Underwater [[Rock balancing|Rock balance]] at 3:55).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "site-specific art" was promoted and refined by Californian artist [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The art of light + space|last=Butterfield|first=Jan|publisher=Abbeville|year=1993|isbn=1558592725|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robert Irwin: All the Rules Will Change|last=Hankins|first=Evelyn|publisher=Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden|year=2016|isbn=3791355147|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was actually first used in the mid-1970s by young sculptors, such as [[Patricia Johanson]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], and [[Athena Tacha]], who had started executing public commissions for large urban sites.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} For ''Two Jumps for Dead Dog Creek'' (1970), Oppenheim attempted a series of standing jumps at a selected site in Idaho, where "the width of the creek became a specific goal to which I geared a bodily activity," with his two successful jumps being "dictated by a land form."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Site-Specific Art: Performance, Place and Documentation|chapter=Embodying Site: Dennis Oppenheim and Vito Acconci|last=Kaye|first=Nick|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=0-203-13829-5|location=New York|pages=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Site specific environmental art was first described as a movement by architectural critic Catherine Howett and art critic [[Lucy Lippard]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Emerging out of [[minimalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=One Place After Another: Site-Specific Art and Locational Identity|chapter=|last=Kwon|first=Miwon|publisher=MIT|year=2002|isbn=0-203-13829-5|location=Cambridge (Massachusetts), London|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; site-specific art opposed the [[Modernism|Modernist]] program of subtracting from the artwork all cues that interfere with the fact that it is "art",&lt;ref&gt;Kaye (citing O'Docherty's ''Inside the White Cube'', 1986), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernist art objects were transportable,  nomadic, could only exist in the museum space and were the objects of the market and commodification. Since 1960 the artists were trying to find a way out of this situation, and thus drew attention to the site and the context around this site. The work of art was created in the site and could only exist and in such circumstances - it can not be moved or changed. '''Site''' is a current location, which comprises a unique combination of physical elements: depth, length, weight, height, shape, walls, temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Kwon, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Works of art began to emerge from the walls of the museum and galleries ([[Daniel Buren]], Within and Beyond the Frame, John Weber Gallery, New York, 1973), were created specifically for the museum and galleries ([[Michael Asher (artist)|Michael Asher]], untitled installation at Claire Copley Gallery, Los Angeles, 1974, [[Hans Haacke]], Condensation Cube, 1963–65, [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]], Hartford Wash: Washing Tracks, Maintenance Outside, Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, 1973), thus criticizing the museum as an institution that sets the rules for artists and viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Kwon, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Max Albert]], created [[Sculptures Bachelard]] in [[Parc de la Villette]] related to the site, or ''Carlotta’s Smile'', a [[trellis (architecture)|trellis]] construction related to Ar. Co,’s architecture [[Lisbon]], and to a choreography in collaboration with Michala Marcus and [[Carlos Zingaro]], 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arcoabecedario.pt/entries/41?locale=en|title=Abecedário — AR.CO — Centro de Arte e Comunicação Visual|website=www.arcoabecedario.pt|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the public debate over ''[[Tilted Arc]]'' (1981) resulted in its removal in 1989, its author [[Richard Serra]] reacted with what can be considered a definition of site-specific art: "To move the work is to destroy the work."&lt;ref&gt;Kaye, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carlotta's Smile.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Max Albert]], ''Carlotta's Smile'', a trellis construction with a choreography, in collaboration with Michala Marcus and [[Carlos Zingaro]], Lisbon, 1979]]

==Examples==
Outdoor site-specific artworks often include [[landscaping]] combined with permanently sited [[sculpture|sculptural]] elements; it is sometimes linked with [[environmental art]]. Outdoor site-specific artworks can also include [[dance]] [[performance]]s created especially for the site. More broadly, the term is sometimes used for any work that is more or less permanently attached to a particular location. In this sense, a building with interesting [[Architecture (built environment)|architecture]] could also be considered a piece of site-specific art.

In Geneva, Switzerland, two Contemporary Art Funds of the city have been looking to integrate art into the architecture and the public space since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://institutions.ville-geneve.ch/fr/fmac/fmac/missions/|title=Missions {{!}} Fonds d'art contemporain {{!}} Ville de Genève : Sites des institutions|website=institutions.ville-geneve.ch|language=fr|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Neons Parallax project initiated in 2007 was conceived specifically for the Plaine de Plainpalais, located in the heart of the city. The challenge of the artists invited was to transpose commercial advertising signs of the harbour into artistic messages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neons.ch Neons Parallax]&lt;/ref&gt; The project has received the Swiss [https://www.juliusbaer.com/global/en/news-insights/news-insights-detail-page/item/the-prix-visarte-2017-an-award-for-public-art/ Prix Visarte 2017].

Site-specific performance art, site-specific visual art and interventions are commissioned for the annual [[Infecting the City]] Festival in [[Cape Town]], South Africa. The site-specific nature of the work allows artists to interrogate the contemporary and historic reality of the Central Business District and create work that allows the city's users to engage and interact with public spaces in new and memorable ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.africacentre.net/infecting-the-city/|title=Infecting The City - Africa Centre|date=2014-03-28|work=Africa Centre|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Songshan Cultural and Creative Park''' ('''SSCC'''; {{zh|c=松山文創園區|p=Sōngshān Wénchuàng Yuánqū}}) is a multifunctional [[park]] in [[Xinyi District]], [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]].

==History==
The park was initially constructed in 1937 as a [[tobacco]] factory under the name {{nihongo|'''Matsuyama Tobacco Plant of the Monopoly Bureau of the Taiwan Governor's Office'''|臺灣總督府專賣局松山菸草工場}} under the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese government]]. After [[Retrocession Day|Japan ceded Taiwan]] in 1945, the Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau took over the factory and renamed it as the '''Songshan Tobacco Plant of the Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau'''. In 1947, the plant was renamed again as '''Songshan Tobacco Plant of the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Bureau'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeiartplus.org/08.html |title=Taipei Art |publisher=Taipeiartplus.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The factory ceased to produce cigarettes in 1998 for concern over urban planning, tobacco and liquor marketing regulatory changes and the decline in tobacco demand.

In 2001, the [[Taipei City Government]] designed the defunct tobacco factory as Taipei's 99th historic site and converted it into a park comprising city-designated historic sites, historical structures and architectural highlights. Together with [[Taipei Dome]], the site is known as '''Taipei Cultural and Sporting Complex'''.

For more efficient reuse of space, in 2011 the former factory was turned into a creative park by its current name to provide venues for diverse cultural and creative exhibitions and performances.

==Purposes==
The park has the following aims:{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

* Establish public platform and develop the cultural and creative industry;
* Cultivate culture and creativity and cross industry exchanges;
* Develop innovative experiments and set trends;
* Provide cultural and arts education and encourage public involvement;
* Spotlight the cultural and creative industry and put Taiwan on the map.

===Warehouses===
There are five warehouses, from number 1 until 5. The workers manufactured cigarettes on the second floor of the plant. After packaging the rolled cigarettes, the boxes were sent directly to warehouse no. 2 using conveyor channel, through the turntable, directed to the platforms for delivery, hence reducing manual labor.

===Inspection Room===
The inspection room served as the place for employees and officers had to pass through when reporting for or getting off work. It had stationed guards on duty.

===Office Building===

===Taiwan Design Museum===
The [[Taiwan Design Museum]] building used to house the office for supervisors and officers of the tobacco plant. The office had also conference rooms and rest areas for guests. Ordinary plant employees were not allowed to access the building.

===Innovative Design Lab===
{{empty section|date=February 2014}}

===Tobacco Factory===
The tobacco factory consists of three segments, which are North, South and East. The building has characteristics of long open hallways with no dividing walls. The first floor mainly comprises columns to support the weight of the machines on the second floor.

===Baroque Garden===
Enclosed by the tobacco factory three sections, the garden has a fountain that is surrounded by sculptures of naked women emerging from their baths.

===TMSK Restaurant===
The building which now houses the TMSK restaurant used to be the machine repair plant building. The machine repair plant was exclusively responsible for the reparation and maintenance of the tobacco producing machines.

===Boiler Room===
The boiler room acted as the power source for the tobacco plant. [[Coal]] was burnt here to provide power for the plant. The chimneys were used to expel the smoke generated.

===Nursery Room===
There used to be 1,200 employees working at the plant at the same time. The tobacco plant had an industrial village concept, in which it included facilities such as cafeterias, shower facilities, dormitories, hospital, food mall, dining rooms, entertainment rooms and nursery. The nursery room served as a place for the infants of the employees to rest and play.

===Ecology Pond===
For fire extinguishing, ventilation and hydrosphere purposes, a large lotus pond was installed. It is now revamped as an ecology pond where children can enjoy the sounds of frogs and insects and experience the beauty of ecology.

===West 201 Conference Room===

{{Refimprove|date=March 2012}}
A '''sound-alike''' is a recording intended to imitate the sound of a popular record, the style of a popular [[recording artist]], or a current musical trend; the term also refers to the artists who perform on such recordings. In the [[voice-over]] world, it may also refer to those who recreate the voice and vocal mannerisms of a given celebrity's vocal performance (see also [[impersonator]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ciccarelli, Stephanie [http://blogs.voices.com/voxdaily/2006/08/sound_alikes_voice_actors.html "Sound Alikes: Not your Average Job Description"], ''Voices.com'', August 9, 2006, accessed February 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sound-alikes are usually made as budget copies or "[[wiktionary:knockoff|knockoffs]]" of popular recordings. The cost of writing and recording a new song that sounds similar to a popular song is usually negligible compared to the cost of royalties for playing the original recording or the [[Music licensing|licensing]] fees to record a [[cover version]]. If the sound-alike recording is dissimilar enough to avoid infringing the original writer's [[copyright]], the user of a sound-alike can evoke the spirit of a song, or sometimes make listeners believe that the work being played has been recorded by a particular artist, without the expense of engaging a highly paid artist. 

A [[cover version]] is sometimes referred to as a sound-alike, but in the stricter sense, a sound-alike must contain differences that are significant enough to suggest to a listener that those recording the song sought to perform a work different from the work to which it sounds similar. A recording intended as an interpretation of a work is not a sound-alike; it is a cover version, for which many countries require licensing for any performance or distribution. 

Sound-alike recordings have been used in movie [[soundtrack]]s and radio and television [[television advertisement|commercials]] since their origin, while sound-alike artists have long recorded [[jingle]]s and other musical material for commercial use. 

Sounds-alikes have sometimes been the subject of litigation. In the 1980s, singer [[Bette Midler]] sued over a sound-alike version of her recording of "[[Do You Wanna Dance?]]" being used in a commercial which sounded too close to the original. "[[Old Cape Cod]]" was the subject of a 1990 lawsuit subsequent to a sound-alike version of the [[Patti Page]] hit which was featured in a 1989 commercial for [[American Savings Bank]]. Page sued the advertising agency responsible for the commercial, alleging the commercial implied that Page, herself, endorsed the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Patti Page Sues Over Sound-Alike Commercial|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-09/local/me-115_1_asher-gould |accessdate=18 February 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=9 January 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guitarist [[Carlos Santana]] sued over a commercial [[music bed]] which closely imitated his playing and arranging style. 

Sound-alike [[album]]s have also long been issued by small, budget-minded record companies, as a way to cash in on the popular artists, movies or [[show tunes]] from hit plays currently in style. [[Lou Reed]] began his recording career working for one such company, [[Pickwick Records]], but years later became a star in his own right, as an original performer. Other such companies were [[Hit Records]] of [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and [[Embassy Records]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Bell Records]] of [[New York City]] also issued sound-alike budget records in the 1950s.

[[Image:SpiralIsland2000.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Spiral Island I in early March 2000]]

'''Spiral Island''' is the name of a [[floating island|floating]] [[artificial island]] built in [[Mexico]] by British artist Richart "Reishee" Sowa. It was destroyed by [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Hurricane Emily]] in 2005; a replacement, Joyxee Island, has been open for tours since 2008.

Spiral Island has been featured in a number of [[newspaper]]s and TV [[Documentary film|documentaries]] around the world, including in [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]], and has been featured in an episode of the ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' TV series, and on the MTV program Extreme Cribs in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scottmader/grand-launch-of-recycled-plastic-bottle-eco-art-is |title=Grand Launch of Recycled Plastic Bottle Eco Art Island by Scott Mader |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiral Island==
The first Spiral island was located in a [[lagoon]] near [[Puerto Aventuras]], on the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of [[Mexico]] south of [[Cancún]]; Richart Sowa began constructing it in 1998.  He filled nets with empty discarded plastic bottles to support a structure of [[plywood]] and [[bamboo]], on which he poured sand and planted numerous plants, including [[mangrove]]s. The island sported a two-story house, a [[solar oven]], a self-[[composting toilet]], and three beaches. He used some 250,000 bottles for the {{convert|66|x|54|ft|m|adj=on}} structure. 

Sowa was ordered to take the island out of the man-made canal in 2004 because many private homes and condos were being built and he lived for one year tied to the end of a loose rock pier. Richart was offered a new location in the bay of Soliman about 200 km south, Finally, he was permitted by Port authorities to tow Spiral Island but the island was destroyed by Hurricane Emily in 2005. &lt;ref&gt;[http://greentravelife.com/richart-sowa-a-green-island-made-of-plasti-bottles/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joyxee Island==
In late 2007 and 2008, Sowa built a replacement for Spiral Island in the waters of [[Isla Mujeres]], the "Island of Women", also near Cancun. It opened for tours in August 2008. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scottmader/grand-launch-recycled-plastic-bottle-ecological-ar |title=Birthing of Floating Recycled Plastic Bottle Eco Art Island by Scott Mader — Kickstarter |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new island was initially {{convert|20|m|ft}} in diameter and contained about 100,000 bottles. It has since expanded to 25 metres (82 ft) due to various plants and mangroves growing from the island.  The new island has three beaches, a house, two ponds, a wave-powered washing machine, solar panels, a solar-powered waterfall and river. The island is a constant work in progress with volunteers and Sowa himself continually making improvements.

In May 2011, Reishee embarked on a project to berth his island out in Isla Mujeres Bay, as it was now too big for its current site off a pier in Laguna Majax. The Mexican Government also recognized Joyxee Island as an "Eco Boat" and therefore needed to comply with all current boating regulations, which involved the purchase of fire extinguishers, life ring buoys and emergency kits. The project was launched on kickstarter.com with a goal of $18,000 that it failed to reach. Reishee later successfully relaunched the project with a more conservative $9,000 goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scottmader/grand-launch-of-recycled-plastic-bottle-eco-art-is |title=Grand Launch of Recycled Plastic Bottle Eco Art Island by Scott Mader |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''The Golden Eagle'' was originally created as the theme for the book ''The World's Greatest Treasure Hunt: Quest for the Golden Eagle'', a work by Ron Shore to help raise $25 million to fund research for the prevention, early detection and cure for [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref name=NBCBayArea /&gt;&lt;ref name=SFGate /&gt;&lt;ref name=MF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.melfisher.com/Library/InTheNewsFullPages/RonShore_0610.asp |title=Golden Eagle |author= |publisher=''[[Mel Fisher|MelFisher.com]]'' |date= |accessdate=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ron Shore commissioned Canadian [[Sculpture|sculptor]] Kevin Peters to help create ''the Golden Eagle''. It took more than 4000 hours to complete.&lt;ref name=WGTH3&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.greathunt.com/TheTreasure/HistoryoftheGoldenEagle.html |title=History of the Golden Eagle |author= |publisher=''The World's Greatest Treasure Hunt'' |date= |accessdate=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KPA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kevinpetersart.com/Gold_Eagle.html |title=Wildlife Art Sculptures - Gold Eagle |author= |publisher=''Kevin Peters Art'' |date= |accessdate=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[statue]] is currently on [[Sales|sale]], with a price tag of $5 million.&lt;ref name=NBCBayArea /&gt;&lt;ref name=SFGate /&gt;&lt;ref name=GE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thegoldeneagle.ca/ |title=The Golden Eagle |author= |publisher=''www.TheGoldenEagle.ca'' |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; $1 million from the sale will be given to the [[breast cancer]] [[Charitable organization|charity]] of the buyer's choice, $1 million will be given to the winner of ''The World's Greatest Treasure Hunt'', while the remaining sum is to be used to promote ''The World's Greatest Treasure Hunt'' to raise additional funds for [[breast cancer]] [[research]].&lt;ref name=GE /&gt;

Participants in ''The World's Greatest Treasure Hunt'' win "The Grand Prize", $1,000,000 in cash by solving clues hidden in the book, ''The World's Greatest Treasure Hunt: Quest for the Golden Eagle'', written by Ron Shore.&lt;ref name=E /&gt;

==Description==
''The Golden Eagle'' contains 18 pounds of solid [[gold]].&lt;ref name=VisA /&gt; The head is made of 18 carat [[Colored gold#White gold|white gold]] and encrusted with 763 [[diamond]]s; and the eyes are made of two 1.1 carat matching pear shaped [[diamond]]s. The Eagle stands watch over [[The Atocha Star Emerald|''the Atocha Star emerald'']], a 12.72 carat [[emerald]]&lt;ref name=SWBC /&gt; valued at $3.18 million in 2013.&lt;ref name=EI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thegoldeneagle.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Appraisal.pdf |title=Valuation Report |author= |publisher=''Emeralds International'' |date=January 25, 2013 |accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tail feathers are 14 kt [[Colored gold#White gold|white gold]]; the body, rock and base are 14 kt [[Colored gold|yellow gold]], and the very bottom pedestal is 10 kt [[Colored gold|yellow gold]].&lt;ref name=WGTH /&gt;

The [[statue]] is approximately {{convert|26|by|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in dimension.&lt;ref name=GE2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegoldeneagle.ca/?page_id=2 |title=Eagle Specifics |author= |publisher=''www.TheGoldenEagle.ca'' |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Science World (Vancouver)|Science World British Columbia]], ''the Golden Eagle'' was designed to be "a treasure that invoked the [[Old World]] craftsmanship of the [[Fabergé egg]]".&lt;ref name=SWBC /&gt; The ''Vancouver is Awesome'' recognized that the design is "with a hint of [[Damien Hirst]]’s skull".&lt;ref name=VisA /&gt;

==Theft==
On May 30, 2016 Ron Shore, who was in possession of the statue, was mugged as he walked to his car after a concert. The perpetrator reportedly fled with Mr. Shore's backpack which contained the statue inside.&lt;ref name="Theft"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/31/world/golden-eagle-stolen/index.html |title=Diamond-encrusted Golden Eagle stolen |website=CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2008">'''''The Megaliths of Upper Laos''''' (orig. French: ''Les Megaliths du Haut Laos'') is a 1930 work of [[archaeology]] by [[Madeleine Colani]], examining and cataloging approximately ten thousand [[megalith]]s in [[Laos|Upper Laos]].&lt;ref name="hills-2008"&gt;Ben Hills, [http://www.smh.com.au/travel/activity/great-outdoors/crack-open-the-jars-20081113-63u7.html "Crack open the jars"], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', Oct. 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to Colani's work, the megaliths were considered among the more mysterious megaliths.&lt;ref name="NYT-2012"&gt;Elisabeth Eaves, [http://travel.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/travel/in-laos-the-lady-and-the-jars.html "In Laos, the Lady and the Jars"], ''[[New York Times]]'', July 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Colani, after reviewing the [[Plain of Jars]] for decades, cataloged the megaliths and argued "convincingly" in ''The Megaliths of Upper Laos'' that they were [[urn]]s,&lt;ref name="NYT-2012" /&gt; used in [[Bronze Age]] [[funerary rites]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell Ciochon and Jamie James, [http://www.uiowa.edu/~bioanth/laoskeep.html "Laos Keeps Its Urns"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715053256/http://www.uiowa.edu/~bioanth/laoskeep.html |date=2009-07-15 }}, Ciochon's Bioanthropology Website, University of Iowa (last visited July 16, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Megaliths of Upper Laos'', a two-volume, 600-page work that both cataloged and described the artifacts, and presented Colani's theories as to their origin and use, has been described as Colani's "great contribution to archaeological literature".&lt;ref name="NYT-2012" /&gt;  The book brought the megaliths to the broader attention of the Western public and scholarly community.&lt;ref name="hills-2008" /&gt;

'''Tintinhull Court''' in [[Tintinhull]], [[Somerset]], England, was built as a medieval parsonage for the [[Church of St Margaret, Tintinhull|Church of St Margaret]].

'''Trinity Church''' ({{lang-sv|Heliga trefaldighetskyrkan}}) is a [[church (building)|church building]] in [[Kristianstad]], [[Sweden]], built between 1617 and 1628 by [[Christian IV of Denmark]]. He had founded the city of Kristianstad in 1614 at a time when [[Scania]] was part of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]]. The church's large size and style reveal the king's ambitions for his new city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sydsverige.dk/?pageID=153 Heliga Trefaldighets kyrka. From Syssverige.dk. Danish.] Retrieved 18 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Trefoldighedskirken indre 2.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Nave and chancel.]]
Designed by the Flemish-Danish architect, [[Lorenz van Steenwinckel]], the grand building is widely considered by many to be [[Scandinavia]]'s finest [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] church. Its extensive nave is able to accommodate congregations of up to 1,400. Like many Danish churches of the times, it is built of red brick. But this church is decorated with many sandstone statues and ornaments, including several monograms of Christian IV, testifying to his involvement.

The well-preserved interior is decked with star-shaped [[Groin vault|cross vaults]], supported by pillars of granite. Trinity Church has been little altered since it was built. The main addition is its 59-meter-tall tower constructed in 1865. The church is pleasantly and abundantly illuminated thanks to its 26 tall windows.

The entrance through the western tower opens into a six-bay nave, with wide aisles, terminating in a projecting eastern sanctuary. The vaults are covered with a cross-gabled roof, with large ornamented gables on the north and south sides.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zKH3j0X8mgcC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=trinity+church+architecture+kristianstad&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RsI0GpfZ19&amp;sig=KficaLWaDllHnYtRfJFrZalzkOw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tDouS62NBsXPjAei__WeBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=trinity%20church%20architecture%20kristianstad&amp;f=false Marian Card Donnelly: Architecture in the Scandinavian countries.

==Furnishings and decorations==

The pulpit, which is sculpted in Belgian and Italian marble, shows Christ and the four evangelists. The impressive canopy hanging above the pulpit weighs almost a ton.

The Baroque organ case survives, including the case pipes, from German-born Johan Lorentz's &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musikhistoriskmuseum.dk/reg/lorentzx.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912192522/http://www.musikhistoriskmuseum.dk/reg/lorentzx.htm |archivedate=2005-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1630 organ, but the organ itself has been replaced.

'''Variable-data publishing (VDP)''' (also known as [[database publishing]]) is a term referring to the output of a variable composition system.  While these systems can produce both electronically viewable and hard-copy (print) output, the "variable-data publishing" term today often distinguishes output destined for electronic viewing, rather than that which is destined for hard-copy print (e.g. [[variable data printing]]).

Essentially the same techniques are employed to perform variable-data publishing, as those utilized with variable data printing.  The difference is in the interpretation for output.  While variable-data printing may be interpreted to produce various print streams or page-description files (e.g. [[Advanced Function Presentation|AFP]]/[[IPDS]], [[PostScript]], [[Printer Command Language|PCL]]), variable-data publishing produces electronically viewable files, most commonly seen in the forms of [[PDF]], [[HTML]], or [[XML]].

Variable-data composition involves the use of data to conditionally:
* exhibit text (static blocks and/or variable content)
* exhibit images
* select fonts
* select colors
* format page layouts &amp; flows

Variable-data may be as simple as an address block or salutation. However, it can be any or all of the document's textual content—including words, sentences, paragraphs, pages, or the entire document.  In other words, it can make up as little or as much of the document as the composer desires.  Variable data may also be used to exhibit various images, such as logos, products, or membership photos.  Further, variable-data can be used to build rule-based design schemes, including fonts, colors, and page formats.  The possibilities are vast.

The variable-data tools available today, make it possible to perform variable-data composition at nearly every stage of document production.  However, the level of control that can be achieved varies, based upon how far into the document production process a variable-data tool is deployed.  For example, if variable-data insertion occurs just prior to output...it's not likely that the text flow or layout can be altered with nearly as much control as would be available at the time of initial document composition.

Many organizations will produce multiple forms of output (aka: multi-channel output), for the same document.  This ensures that the published content is available to recipients via any form of access method they might require.  When multi-channel output is utilized, integrity between those output channels often becomes important.

Variable-data publishing may be performed on everything from a [[personal computer]] to a [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] system.  However, the speed and practical output volumes which can be achieved are directly affected by the computer power utilized.

==Origin of the concept==

The term variable-data publishing was likely an offshoot of the term "variable-data printing", first introduced to the printing industry by Frank Romano, Professor Emeritus, School of Print Media, at the [[College of Imaging Arts and Sciences]] at [[Rochester Institute of Technology]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} However, the concept of merging static document elements and variable document elements predates the term and has seen various implementations ranging from simple desktop '[[mail merge]]', to complex [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] applications in the financial and banking industry. In the past, the term VDP has been most closely associated with digital printing machines. However, in the past 3 years the application of this technology has spread to web pages, emails, and mobile messaging.

'''''Viva Zapatero!''''' is a 2005 documentary by [[Sabina Guzzanti]] telling her side of the story regarding the conflict with [[Silvio Berlusconi]] over a late-night TV political satire show broadcast on RAI-3.

The  show, ''RAIot'' (a play on the name of the Italian state public TV: ''[[RAI]]'', and the English word ''[[riot]]''), lampooned prime minister Berlusconi. Since it wasn't considered a satirical show, but a political one, it was cancelled after the first episode.

==Origin==
''Viva Zapatero!'' is titled after the famous "[[Viva Zapata!]]" and it also refers to the Spanish prime minister, [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], who, immediately after gaining power in Spain, ensured that the head of the state-run public broadcaster would no longer be a political appointee {{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} (as opposed to Italy).

==Story==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
The TV broadcasting of the satirical program RAIot was censored in November 2003 after the comedian, Sabina Guzzanti, made outspoken criticism of the Berlusconi media empire. [[Mediaset]], one of [[Berlusconi]]'s companies, sued the Italian state broadcasting company RAI because of the Guzzanti show asking for 20 million Euro for "damages" and from November 2003 she was forced to appear only in theatres around Italy.

In August 2005, it was the sleeper hit of the [[Venice International Film Festival]], receiving a 15-minute [[standing ovation]] after its premiere screening. When it opened in Italian theaters, over 200,000 people went to see it in the first week. Its success resulted in an invitation to the 2006 [[Sundance Film Festival]].

{{Literature}}
'''World literature''' is sometimes used to refer to the sum total of the world's national literatures, but usually it refers to the circulation of works into the wider world beyond their country of origin. Often used in the past primarily for masterpieces of [[European literature|Western European literature]], world literature today is increasingly seen in global context. Readers today have access to an unprecedented range of works from around the world in excellent translations, and since the mid-1990s a lively debate has grown up concerning both the aesthetic and the political values and limitations of an emphasis on global processes over national traditions.

==History==
[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] used the concept of ''Weltliteratur'' in several of his essays in the early decades of the nineteenth century to describe the international circulation and reception of literary works in Europe, including works of non-Western origin. The concept achieved wide currency after his disciple Johann Peter Eckermann published a collection of conversations with Goethe in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;Johann Peter Eckermann, ''Gespräche mit Goethe in den letzten Jahren seines Lebens,'' trans. John Oxenford as J. W. von Goethe, ''Conversations with Eckermann,'' repr. North Point Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Goethe spoke with Eckermann about the excitement of reading Chinese novels and Persian and Serbian poetry as well as of his fascination with seeing how his own works were translated and discussed abroad, especially in France. In a famous statement in January 1827, Goethe predicted to Eckermann that in the coming years world literature would supplant the national literatures as the major mode of literary creativity: 

{{quote|I am more and more convinced that poetry is the universal possession of mankind, revealing itself everywhere and at all times in hundreds and hundreds of men.&amp;nbsp;... I therefore like to look about me in foreign nations, and advise everyone to do the same.  National literature is now a rather unmeaning term; the epoch of world literature is at hand, and everyone must strive to hasten its approach.&lt;ref&gt;Eckermann, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Reflecting a fundamentally economic understanding of world literature as a process of trade and exchange, [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] used the term in their ''[[The Communist Manifesto|Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848) to describe the "cosmopolitan character" of [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] literary production, asserting that

{{quote|In place of the old wants, satisfied by the productions of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climates. ... And as in material, so also in intellectual production. The intellectual creations of individual nations become common property. National one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible, and from the numerous national and local literatures, there arises a world literature.}}

Martin Puchner has argued that Goethe had a keen sense of world literature as driven by a new world market in literature. It was this market-based approach that Marx and Engels pick up in 1848. But while the two authors admire the world literature created by bourgeois [[capitalism]], they also seek to exceed it. They hoped to create a new type of world literature, one exemplified by the ''Manifesto'', which was to be published simultaneously in many languages and several locations. This text was supposed to inaugurate a new type of world literature and in fact partially succeeded, becoming one of the most influential texts of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Puchner, Poetry of the Revolution: Marx, Manifestos and the Avant-Gardes." Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas Marx and Engels followed Goethe in seeing world literature as a modern or even future phenomenon, in 1886 the Irish scholar [[H. M. Posnett]] argued that world literature first arose in ancient empires such as the Roman Empire, long before the rise of the modern national literatures.&lt;ref&gt;H. M. Posnett, ''Comparative Literature.'' London: K. Paul, Trench, 1886&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly today, world literature is understood as including classical works from all periods, as well as contemporary literature written for a global audience.
By the turn of the twentieth century, intellectuals in various parts of the globe were thinking actively about world literature as a frame for their own national production, a theme found in essays by several of the progressive writers of China's May Fourth movement, including [[Lu Xun]].

==Contemporary understandings==
Over the course of the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth, the rising tide of nationalism led to an eclipse of interest in world literature, but in the postwar era, comparative and world literature began to enjoy a resurgence in the United States. As a nation of immigrants, and with a less well established national tradition than many older countries possessed, the United States became a thriving site for the study of comparative literature (often primarily at the graduate level) and of world literature, often taught as a first-year general education class. The focus remained largely on the Greek and Roman classics and the literatures of the major modern Western European powers, but a confluence of factors in the late 1980s and early 1990s led to a greater openness to the wider world. The end of the Cold War, the growing globalization of the world economy, and new waves of immigration from many parts of the world led to several efforts to open out the study of world literature. This change is well illustrated by the expansion of ''The Norton Anthology of World Masterpieces,'' whose first edition of 1956 featured only Western European and North American works, to a new "expanded edition" of 1995 with substantial non-Western selections, and with the title changed from "masterpieces" to the less exclusive "Literature".&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology of World Literature'', ed. Maynard Mack and Sarah Lawall, Expanded Edition, 1995. Third edition, ed. Martin Puchner et al., 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The major survey anthologies today, including those published by Longman and by Bedford in addition to Norton, all showcase several hundred authors from dozens of countries.

The explosive growth in the range of cultures studied under the rubric of world literature has inspired a variety of theoretical attempts to define and delimit the field and to propose effective modes of research and teaching. In his 2003 book ''What Is World Literature?'' David Damrosch argued for world literature as less a vast canon of works and more a matter of circulation and reception, and he proposed that works that thrive as world literature are ones that work well and even gain in various ways in translation. Whereas Damrosch's approach remains tied to the close reading of individual works, a very different view was taken by the Stanford critic [[Franco Moretti]] in a pair of articles offering "Conjectures on World Literature".&lt;ref&gt;Franco Moretti, "Conjectures on World Literature." ''New Left Review'' 1 (2000), pp. 54–68; repr. in Prendergast, ''Debating World Literature,'' pp. 148–162. Moretti offered further reflections in "More Conjectures," ''New Left Review'' 20 (2003), pp. 73–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Moretti argued that the scale of world literature far exceeds what can be grasped by traditional methods of close reading, and he advocated instead a mode of "distant reading" that would look at large-scale patterns as discerned from publication records and national literary histories, enabling one to trace the global sweep of forms such as the novel or film.

Moretti's approach combined elements of evolutionary theory with the world-systems analysis pioneered by [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], an approach further discussed since then by Emily Apter in her influential book ''The Translation Zone.''&lt;ref&gt;Emily Apter, ''The Translation Zone: A New Comparative Literature.'' Princeton: Princeton U.P., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Related to their world-systems approach is the major work of French critic Pascale Casanova, ''La République mondiale des lettres'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;''The World Republic of Letters,'' trans. M. B. DeBevoise, Harvard U.P., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on the theories of cultural production developed by the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, Casanova explores the ways in which the works of peripheral writers must circulate into metropolitan centers in order to achieve recognition as works of world literature. Both Moretti and Casanova emphasize the inequalities of the global literary field, which Moretti describes as "one, but unequal".

The field of world literature continues to generate debate, with critics such as [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]] arguing that too often the study of world literature in translation smooths out both the linguistic richness of the original and the political force a work can have in its original context.&lt;ref&gt;See Gayatri C. Spivak, ''Death of a Discipline.''&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, on the contrary, emphasize that world literature can and should be studied with close attention to original languages and contexts, even as works take on new dimensions and new meanings abroad. Once a primarily European and American concern, world literature is now actively studied and discussed in many parts of the world. World literature series are now being published in China and in Estonia, and a new Institute for World Literature, offering month-long summer sessions on theory and pedagogy, had its inaugural session at Peking University in 2011, with its next sessions at Istanbul Bilgi University in 2012 and at Harvard University in 2013.
Since the middle of the first decade of the new century, a steady stream of works has provided materials for the study of the history of world literature and the current debates. Valuable collections of essays include:
*[[Manfred Schmeling]], ''Weltliteratur Heute'' (1995)
*[[Christopher Prendergast]], ''Debating World Literature'' (2004)
*[[David Damrosch]], ''Teaching World Literature'' (2009)
*[[Theo D'haen]]'s co-edited collections ''The Routledge Companion to World Literature'' (2011) and ''World Literature: A Reader'' (2012).

Individual studies include:
*Moretti, ''Maps, Graphs, Trees'' (2005)
*[[John Pizer]], ''The Idea of World Literature'' (2006),
*[[Mads Rosendahl Thomsen]], ''Mapping World Literature'' (2008)
*Theo D'haen, ''The Routledge Concise History of World Literature'' (2011)
*[[Tötösy de Zepetnek]], Steven, and [[Tutun Mukherjee]], eds. ''Companion to Comparative Literature, World Literatures, and Comparative Cultural Studies'' (2013).

==On the Internet==
The World Wide Web provides in many ways the logical medium for the global circulation of world literature, and many websites now enable readers around the world to sample the world's literary productions. The website Words Without Borders offers a wide selection of fiction and poetry from around the world, and the Annenberg Foundation has created an ambitious thirteen-part DVD/web series produced by Boston's public television station WGBH, "Invitation to World Literature." The major survey anthologies all have extensive websites, providing background information, images, and links to resources on many authors. Finally, globally oriented authors themselves are increasingly creating work for the internet. The Serbian experimentalist Milorad Pavić (1929–2009) was an early proponent of the possibilities of electronic modes of creation and reading, as can be seen on his website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khazars.com Pavić's website] is named for his best-known novel, ''Dictionary of the Khazars'' (1983), a worldwide bestseller with over five million copies sold in a host of languages – an eminent example of the possibility today for a writer from a small country to reach a global audience.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Pavić remained primarily a print-based writer, the Korean/American duo known as Young-hae Chang Heavy Industries create their works entirely for internet distribution, often in several languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yhchang.com www.yhchang.com]&lt;/ref&gt; World literature today exists in symbiosis with national literatures, enabling writers in small countries to reach out to global audiences, and helping readers around the world gain a better sense of the world around them as it has been reflected and refracted in the world's literatures over the past five millennia.

==Classics==
What texts count as world literature is debatable. While some argue that a work's exemplary artistic value and influence allow it to enter the canon of world literature, many scholars of world literature point out that literary quality is not inherent nor influence universal or lasting; rather, standards of quality are relative and vary among communities and across space and time. As the scholar David Damrosch writes, "Over the centuries, an unusually shifty work can come in and out of the sphere of world literature several different times; and at any given point, a work may function as world literature for some readers but not others, and for some kinds of reading but not others. The shifts a work may undergo, moreover, do not reflect the unfolding of some internal logic of the work in itself but come about through often complex dynamics of cultural change and contestation. Very few works secure a quick and permanent place in the limited company of perennial World Masterpieces; most works shift around over time, even moving into and out of the category of 'the masterpiece.'"&lt;ref name="Damrosch 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Damrosch|first1=David|author-link1=David Damrosch|title=What Is World Literature?|date=2003|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691049861|page=6|url=http://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7545.pdf|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thus, rather than gauge a work's worthiness as world literature on its inherent quality or lasting influence, many scholars assert that what makes a work world literature is merely its circulation beyond its country of origin. For example, Damrosch states, "A work enters into world literature by a double process: first, by being read as literature; second, by circulating out into a broader world beyond its linguistic and cultural point of origin."&lt;ref name="Damrosch 2003" /&gt; Likewise, the world literature scholar Venkat Mani argues that the "worlding" of literature is brought about by "information transfer" largely generated by developments in print culture, specifically the advent of the library: "Publishers and booksellers who print and sell affordable books, literate citizens who acquire these books, and public libraries that make these books available to those who cannot afford to buy them collectively play a very important role in the “making” of world literature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=D’haen|editor-first1=Theo|editor-last2=Damrosch|editor-first2=David|editor-link2=David Damrosch|editor-last3=Kadir |editor-first3=Djelal |last1=Mani|first1= B. Venkat|chapter=Chapter 29. Bibliomigrancy|title=The Routledge Companion to World Literature|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415570220|page=284|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=soqoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers then will have to decide for themselves on what counts as world literature and whether that status is determined by the work itself or larger social forces at work on it.
