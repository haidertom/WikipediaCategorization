From March to May 1998, a terror plot against the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] in France was uncovered by European law enforcement.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{Cite news|title=European Police Raids Target World Cup Terrorist Threat|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/27/sports/sp-53951|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=27 May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Europe Overview|journal=Patterns of Global Terrorism: 1998|url=https://fas.org/irp/threat/terror_98/europe.htm|publisher=[[Bureau of Counterterrorism|Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism]] (United States Department of State)|date=April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100 people were arrested in seven countries as a result of the plot.&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Simon|last=Kuper|authorlink=Simon Kuper|title=Is football facing a new age of stadium terrorism after Paris attacks?|url=http://www.espnfc.com/european-championship/74/blog/post/2715900/paris-attacks-and-a-new-age-of-stadium-terrorism|work=ESPN FC|date=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organised by the Algerian [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]] (GIA) and backed by [[al-Qaeda]] leader [[Osama bin Laden]], the plot is thought to have targeted the [[1998 FIFA World Cup Group G#England vs Tunisia|England–Tunisia match]] on 15 June 1998, and involved infiltrating the [[Stade Vélodrome]] in [[Marseille]] in order to attack players and spectators during the game, attack the hotel in [[Paris]] hosting the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]], and finally hijacking an aircraft and crashing it into the [[Civaux Nuclear Power Plant]] near [[Poitiers]].&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;

==Raids and arrests==
The original suspect of the plot was French-Algerian [[Farid Melouk]], who had previously been sentenced ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' to seven years in prison in France for his connection to the [[1995 Paris Métro and RER bombings]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite news|title=World News Briefs; Belgians Arrest Suspect In Paris Bombings|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/06/world/world-news-briefs-belgians-arrest-suspect-in-paris-bombings.html|work=The New York Times|date=6 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Depeche"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bruxelles : échec au réseau du GIA|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/1998/03/06/186734-bruxelles-echec-au-reseau-du-gia.html|work=La Dépêche du Midi|date=6 March 1998|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Anschläge bei Fußball-WM?|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-7838193.html|work=Der Spiegel|date=16 March 1998|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Silhouette|url=http://www.la-croix.com/Archives/1998-11-10/Silhouette-_NP_-1998-11-10-462539|work=La Croix|date=10 November 1998|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Le repaire belge du terrorisme|url=http://www.lalibre.be/actu/international/le-repaire-belge-du-terrorisme-51b874c6e4b0de6db9a638e6|work=La Libre Belgique|date=14 September 2001|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melouk had reportedly been tracked by intelligence services following his entry into [[Belgium]], where he was found to be in contact with [[Ahmed Zaoui]] and a GIA-linked [[Brussels]] mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 2002, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 March, after two weeks of surveillance, fifty police officers stormed a house where Melouk was staying with others involved in the plot.&lt;ref name="Robinson173"&gt;Robinson, 2002, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Ten people including Swedish and Danish nationals were arrested in the 12-hour siege, amid a series of anti-terrorism raids in Belgium.&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Depeche"/&gt; Large amounts of liquid explosives were found during the raid, as well as detonators, a [[AK-47|Kalashnikov rifle]], several handguns and thousands worth of [[United States dollar|US dollars]] in cash.&lt;ref name="Robinson173"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FFI"&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Brynjar|last1=Lia|authorlink1=Brynjar Lia|first2=Åshild|last2=Kjøk|date=8 August 2001|title=Islamist Insurgencies, Diasporic Support Networks, and their Host States: The Case of the Algerian GIA in Europe 1993–2000|url=https://www.ffi.no/no/Rapporter/01-03789.pdf|publisher=[[Norwegian Defence Research Establishment]] (FFI)|pages=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a large number of documents, brochures and maps relating to the World Cup were retrieved.&lt;ref name="Robinson173"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt; More explosives were uncovered in a follow-up raid of another house.&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"/&gt;

The March raid was part of a joint security operation between Belgium, France, Sweden, Italy and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"/&gt; Despite initial Belgian claims denying links to any plot against the World Cup, the plot was later confirmed by the French counter-intelligence chief.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Chronology: The Plots|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/front/special/cron.html|work=Frontline|publisher=PBS|date=25 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melouk was sentenced to 9 years in prison for charges including attempted murder.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt; In early May, eight suspected militants linked to the plot were arrested in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 2002, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 26 May, nearly 100 people were detained in coordinated operations across France, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and Germany.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt; In France, 53 men including Algerian, French and Tunisian nationals suspected of links to ex-GIA commander [[Hassan Hattab]] were detained across 43 locations, including in Marseilles, Paris, [[Lyon]] and [[Corsica]]; around 25 were arrested and charged or deported.&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 2002, pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; Five Algerians were arrested in Germany after raids across several cities, ten in Belgium, two in Switzerland, six in Italy, and many more detained.&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 2002, pp. 188–189&lt;/ref&gt; French Interior Minister [[Jean-Pierre Chevènement]] said on French television after the arrests that investigators had found evidence of plots to attack the World Cup.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt; Islamist paraphernalia and $150,000 in cash were found during the raids, but no explosives or arms.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt; Some police sources have said that a goal of the May raids was to crush GIA support networks.&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt; According to counter-terrorism magistrate [[Jean-Louis Bruguière]], the May raids were a preventive measure to protect the tournament.&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"/&gt;

==Plot and aftermath==
The plot involved terrorists infiltrating the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille as stadium crew, in order to attack English players and spectators during the England-Tunisia match on 15 June.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt; Terrorists had reportedly planned to blow up the England substitute bench (targeting youngsters [[David Beckham]] and [[Michael Owen]]), shoot English players and throw grenades into the stands.&lt;ref name="ESPN2"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Harry|last=Harris|title=England terrorist plot revealed|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/683732/england-football-team-escaped-terrorist-attack-at-1998-world-cup|work=ESPN FC|date=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Laurent|last=Dubois|year=2010|title=Soccer Empire: The World Cup and the Future of France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tyBmBcbZIMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=no&amp;pg=PT181#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=University of California Press|page=181|isbn=9780520259287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other terrorists were then to storm the United States national team's hotel in Paris and attack American players watching the game there.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt; The attacks would be followed by another group of terrorists who would hijack an aircraft and crash it into the Civaux Nuclear Power Plant near Poitiers, causing a [[nuclear meltdown]].&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;

The details or even existence of the plot was kept secret from managers, players and the media, but was known to security including [[The Football Association|FA]] staff.&lt;ref name="ESPN2"/&gt; In 2009, England manager in 1998 [[Glenn Hoddle]] revealed that he had only been informed of the plot "years later", while FA Director of Communications during 1998 [[David Davies (football administrator)|David Davies]] said that he had been informed of the plot before the match by FA Head of Security Brian Hayes.&lt;ref name="ESPN2"/&gt; The match was otherwise marred by supporter riots in Marseilles, with British vehicles being bricked while bottles were thrown across the streets, causing police to use tear gas as large numbers of supporters were injured and arrested.&lt;ref name="ESPN2"/&gt;

Although organised by GIA operatives, the plot reportedly had the backing and support of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor-first1=Nicholas John|editor-last1=Cull|editor-first2=David Holbrook|editor-last2=Culbert|editor-first3=David|editor-last3=Welch|first=Nicholas J.|last=Cull|year=2003|title=Propaganda and Mass Persuasion: A Historical Encyclopedia, 1500 to the Present|chapter=Osama bin Laden|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Byzv7rf6gL8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=no&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=222|isbn=9781576078204}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to bin Laden biographer [[Yossef Bodansky]], the World Cup plot being foiled was one of the reasons for "dormant terrorist networks" responsible for the August [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] being "reactivated". The attacks killed over 200 and wounded more than 4,000.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Simon|last=Kuper|title=The World's Game Is Not Just A Game|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/26/magazine/the-world-s-game-is-not-just-a-game.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times Magazine|date=26 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A terror plot against the [[UEFA Euro 2000]] was discovered after Dutch intelligence intercepted calls made between GIA operatives from inside French prisons.&lt;ref name="ESPN2000"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Gun guard on French soccer stars|url=http://www.espnfc.com.au/euro2000/news/20000620frathreat.html|work=ESPN Soccernet|date=20 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three men were detained in French prisons as a result of the plot, and three were subsequently arrested in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="ESPN2000"/&gt; One of the French prisoners detained for the plot was Adel Mechat, who served 6 years after having been arrested in Germany and extradited to France as part of the 1998 World Cup raids.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN2000"/&gt;

The night before the first ever football match between France and Algeria in October 2001, police seized explosives and arrested four Islamist militants suspected of having targeted the game after a phone call had been intercepted with warnings to stay away from the [[Stade de France]]. Other items retrieved included bulletproof vests and explosives manuals.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{Cite news|title=International Football: Seventeen held as Algerian fans invade pitch|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/3014255/International-Football-Seventeen-held-as-Algerian-fans-invade-pitch.html|work=The Telegraph|date=7 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match itself became marred with controversy, and was eventually stopped with 15 minutes left playing after Algerian fans stormed the field.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25225">{{redirect|The Absolute|the ''Animorphs'' novel|The Absolute (Animorphs)||Absolute (disambiguation)}}
In [[philosophy]], the concept of '''The Absolute''', also known as '''The (Unconditioned) Ultimate''', '''The Wholly Other''', '''The [[Supreme Being]]''',  '''The Absolute/Ultimate Reality''', and other names, is the thing, being, entity, power, force, reality, presence, law, principle, etc. that possesses maximal [[Ontology|ontological]] status, existential ranking, existential greatness, or existentiality. In layman's terms, this is the one that is, in one way or another, the greatest, truest, or most [[Reality|real]] [[being]].

There are many conceptions of The Absolute in various fields and subjects, such as [[philosophy]], [[religion]], [[Spirituality|spiritual traditions]], [[mathematics]], and even [[natural science]]. The nature of these conceptions can range from "merely" encompassing all [[Physics|physical]] existence, [[nature]], or [[reality]], to being completely unconditioned existentially, [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcending]] all concepts, notions, and types, kinds, and categories of being.

The Absolute is often thought of as causing to come into being manifestations that interact with lower or lesser forms of being. This is either done passively, through [[Emanationism|emanations]], or actively, through [[avatar]]s and [[incarnation]]s. These existential manifestations, which themselves can possess [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] attributes, only contain minuscule or infinitesimal portions of the true essence of The Absolute.

The term itself was not in use in ancient or medieval philosophy, but closely related to the description of God as ''[[Actus purus]]'' (Pure Actuality) in [[scholasticism]]. It was introduced in modern philosophy, notably by [[Hegel]], for "the sum of all being, actual and potential".&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=The Absolute}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term has since also been adopted in  [[perennial philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Perennial Philosophy|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|isbn=9780061724947|location=New York|language=English}}
{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Systematic-Theology-Vol-Paul-Tillich/dp/B000HHSNBE/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461745891&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=paul+tillich++1951|title=Systematic Theology. Vol. I.|last=Tillich|first=Paul|date=1951-01-01|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major conceptions of The Absolute==
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}
There are three general ways of conceiving the Absolute. The Absolute might be (1) the first and greatest being, (2) not a being at all but the "ground" of being, or (3) both the ground of being and a being.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In conception one the Absolute is the most true and intelligible reality. It can be spoken of and known. For example, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s Absolute Spirit is the most true reality. It is thinkable, speakable, and exists in the objective world by comprehending everything, including people, states, and world history.

In conception two the Absolute might be conceived of as utterly outside of all other reality and hence unintelligible. It cannot be known or spoken about. Plato's Socrates says that "[[Form of the Good|The Form of the Good]]" is "beyond being",&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Republic'', Book VI, 508.&lt;/ref&gt; implying that it is even beyond thought, language, and normal categories of existence.

St. [[John of the Cross]] says:
{{poemquote
|text=He who truly arrives there
cuts free from himself;
all that he knew before
now seems worthless,
and his knowledge so soars
that he is left in unknowing
transcending all knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Works-Saint-John-Cross-ebook/dp/B00V21HZ8G/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461745961&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=st+john+of+the+cross|title=The Complete Works of Saint John of the Cross, Volume 1 of 2|last=Cross|first=St John of the|date=2015-01-16|publisher=Waxkeep Publishing|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In conception three the Absolute is seen as transcending duality and distinction. This concept of a fundamental reality that transcends or includes all other reality is usually (but not always) associated with [[divinity]]. While this conception initially seems contradictory, it has been highly influential. One way to understand this third conception is to consider the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]''.

{{poemquote
|text=The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
|source=Tao Te Ching, 1
}}

These opening lines distinguish between two [[Tao]]s. One is the "eternal Tao" (which cannot be named or explained) and the other "Tao" seems to exist in space and time (and can be named and explained). The eternal Tao is beyond existence and cannot be named or fully understood, while the other Tao exists and can be known. The eternal Tao is infinite; the other is finite. The eternal Tao is formless; the other is formed. The eternal Tao is transcendent; the other is immanent. The other "Tao" is an attempt to describe the "eternal Tao" in human terms; but such effort can never express the eternal Tao fully. He continues:
{{poemquote
|text=The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth
The named is the mother of myriad things
Thus, constantly without desire, one observes its essence
Constantly with desire, one observes its manifestations
These two emerge together but differ in name
The unity is said to be the mystery.
}}

In these lines, he further discusses the difference between the two Taos. The eternal Tao is "nameless" and is the origin of Heaven and Earth; this origin can be understood as an underlying [[metaphysics]] that cannot be described fully. The "named" Tao, on the other hand, is able to describe specific phenomenons that exist in space and time, hence it is the mother of myriad of things; it also can be treated as the humanly conceived concepts in the effort to describe our physical world. Later, he points out that both the "named" and the "nameless" emerge together from the same eternal Tao. This seemingly self-contradictory unity, of course, is said to be the mystery to be understood.

===Cross-cultural conception===

===Interpretations===
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}
While these conceptions are superficially similar, they admit of multiple interpretations. Some philosophers, especially perennialists and [[pantheism|pantheist]] philosophers, find great significance in the similarities between these different words and argue that various/all cultures past and present have an identical concept of the 'Absolute'.

Other philosophers, however, argue that these concepts are not the same,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c6aHAgAAQBAJ|title=Philosophy of Religion: A Contemporary Introduction|last=Yandell|first=Keith E.|date=2002-01-22|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134827237|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moser|first=Paul|date=2009-01-01|title=Exclusivism, Inclusivism, and Kardiatheology|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/MOSEIA|journal=Philosophia Christi|volume=11|issue=2|pages=293–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the Logos is rational and formal whereas Brahman is formless and irrational; and since Plato's Form of the Good is impersonal where the Christian God is personal; since Bradley's Absolute is a conscious experience whereas [[Brand Blanshard]]'s Absolute is an unconscious, intelligible system.

Perennialist philosophers such as John Hick argue that even if the concepts vary slightly, the reality of the Absolute reality behind the varying concepts is the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hick/|title=Hick, John {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Within religious traditions ====
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}
Philosophers such as [[Adi Shankara]] denied the Absolute any personal sense, whereas philosophers such as [[Ramanuja]] and [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]], tended to identify the Absolute with a [[Ishvara|personal God]]. The [[Traditionalist School]], via [[Frithjof Schuon]], admits:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is true that God as creator, revealer, and savior is not to be identified with the Absolute as such; it is likewise true that God in Himself, in the full depth of His reality, is not to be reduced to the creative Function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.studiesincomparativereligion.com/Public/articles/browse_g.aspx?ID=261|title=Form and Substance in the Religions|last=Schuon|first=Frithjof|date=1974|website=Studies in Comparative Religion|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Early Hinduism identified [[Brahman]] with [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]]. The same immortal spirit was conceived of as functional in the world in three ways: creation, preservation, and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03270.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 3: Vana Parva: Draupadi-harana Parva: Section CCLXX|last=Ganguli|first=Kisari Mohan|date=|website=Sacred Texts|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|quote=The Supreme Spirit hath three conditions. In the form of Brahma, he is the Creator, and in the form of Vishnu he is the Preserver, and in his form as Rudra, he is the Destroyer of the Universe!}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was therefore no real contradiction between [[Bhakti|love of a personal God]] and [[Brahman|an impersonal Absolute]], although the latter was sometimes conceived of as "purer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mahavidya.ca/2015/03/04/nirguna-and-saguna-brahman/|title=Nirguna and Saguna Brahman|last=Rodrigues|first=Hillary|date=2015|website=Mahavidya|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|quote=Until this occurs, “the world…even including Isvara (the Lord), is not ultimately true or real, but that ultimate reality belongs only to the infinite, eternal, unchanging, pure bliss consciousness that is Brahman…all that we see with our senses, even our private thoughts, Advaita claims, are not ultimately real” (Betty 216).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shaivism]], and most [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] Indian religions, gave God five functions: creation, preservation, destruction, concealment, and revelation. [[Shiva]], as [[Brahman]], would therefore act in the world as a personal God. Yet this distinction between the Absolute and Infinite, or Transcendent and Immanent is not entirely, in itself, absolute. Philosophers like Shankara believe that upon doing away with [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] the entire universe disappears, including the notion of a personal God. Philosophers such as [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]] and [[Ramanuja]], tend to propound an identification of the Absolute with God, whereas later philosophers such as [[Nimbarka]] and [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Caitanya]], tended to identify the Absolute with a personal form of God ([[Krishna]]). Either way, all these claims, taken in context, tend to prove non-contradictory.

The quote above, via Schuon, is actually fully represented within the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition. [[Brahma]], the creator god, is not worshiped within Hinduism. The only deities that are worshiped, are [[Shiva]], and [[Vishnu]]. Both Shiva and Vishnu, by their respective devotees, are represented as having power over the following five functions: creation, preservation, destruction, concealment, and revelation. However, a further distinction is made by Shankara: God is not [[Brahman]] (the Absolute). Rather the appearance of God is still via the power of [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]. So there are in effect, three levels, which Schuon himself observes: Brahman (the Absolute), God as creator, revealer, and savior (AKA, Shiva or Vishnu), and finally God as creator (AKA, Brahma). Incidental reasons are given for Brahma's lack of worship, a Hindu myth attributes this situation to a curse by [[Bhrigu]]. [[Devdutt Pattanaik]], an Indian author, gives some philosophical reasons. Ultimately the reason is actually inherent ("inherent" in the Absolute) and theological.

== Relation of humanity to the Absolute==
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}

[[Laozi]] taught that the Tao was not only the ultimate reality but the ideal of human life. Another conceptual similarity between various conceptions is that the ultimate reality also somehow reveals to humans the way to live. For example, Plato taught that the Good was both the source of reality, the highest object of knowledge, and the ultimate end of desire.

[[C. S. Lewis]] explains the connection between the highest reality and human action in this way:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLRLoWGgWqYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=abolition+of+man&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiz_sDY3P_ZAhXJrFQKHcIlCPgQ6AEIKTAA&amp;q=rta|title=The Abolition of Man|last=Lewis|first=C.S.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1943|isbn=978-0-06-065294-4|location=United Kingdom|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|text=In early Hinduism that conduct in men which can be called good consists in conformity to, or almost participation in, the Rta—that great ritual or pattern of nature and supernature which is revealed alike in the cosmic order, the moral virtues, and the ceremonial of the temple. Righteousness, correctness, order, the Rta, is constantly identified with satya or truth, correspondence to reality. As Plato said that the Good was 'beyond existence' and Wordsworth that through virtue the stars were strong, so the Indian masters say that the gods themselves are born of the Rta and obey it. The Chinese also speak of a great thing (the greatest thing) called the Tao. It is the reality beyond all predicates, the abyss that was before the Creator Himself. It is Nature, it is the Way, the Road. It is the Way in which the universe goes on, the Way in which things everlastingly emerge, stilly and tranquilly, into space and time. It is also the Way which every man should tread in imitation of that cosmic and supercosmic progression, conforming all activities to that great exemplar. 'In ritual', say the Analects, 'it is harmony with Nature that is prized.' The ancient Jews likewise praise the Law as being 'true'. This conception in all its forms, Platonic, Aristotelian, Stoic, Christian, and Oriental alike, I shall henceforth refer to for brevity simply as 'the Tao'.|sign=C.S. Lewis|source=The Abolition of Man}}

[[I. K. Taimni]] says:
{{Quotation|Because the Ultimate Reality which is denoted by the word 'Absolute' or 'Parabrahman' (卍) is the very core of our being as well as the cause and basis of the universe of which we are part, we can no more get away from it than our solar system can get away from the sun round which it resolves and from which it receives everything which keeps it alive and moving. Although the Absolute is sometimes referred to by such epithets as the Void, Ever-Darkness etc. and is beyond intellectual comprehension, still, from the intellectual point of view it is the most profound concept in the whole realm of philosophy. The fact that it is called 'Unknowable' does not mean that it is beyond the range of philosophical or religious thought and something on which thinking is impossible or undesirable. The very fact that it is the heart and the basis of the universe should make it the most intriguing object of enquiry within the realms of the intellect. |I. K. Taimni|''Man, God and the Universe''|Chapter 1&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "core of our being" is [[Freudian]]; see {{Cite journal | author = Bettina Bock von Wülfingen | year = 2013 | title = Freud's 'Core of our Being' Between Cytology and Psychoanalysis | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bewi.201301604/pdf | journal = Berichte zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 226–244 | doi = 10.1002/bewi.201301604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Aldous Huxley says:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Perennial Philosophy|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|year=1945|isbn=978-0-06-172494-7|location=United States|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|text=Only the transcendent, the completely other, can be immanent without being modified by the becoming of that in which it dwells. The Perennial Philosophy teaches that it is desirable and indeed necessary to know the spiritual Ground of things, not only within the soul, but also outside in the world and, beyond world and soul, in its transcendent otherness 'in heaven.' ... God within and God without; these are two abstract notions, which can be entertained by the understanding and expressed in words.|sign=Aldous Huxley|source=The Perennial Philosophy}}

Similarly, the Hindu Taimni describes the [[Parabrahman]] as unknowable by the human mind and unthinkable but the highest object of realization and the most profound object of philosophical enquiry.&lt;ref&gt;I. K. Taimni ''Man, God and the Universe'' Quest Books, 1974, p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plotinus]] likewise taught that the goal of philosophy was to "contemplate the One".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/|title=Plotinus - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=|date=|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiencing the Absolute ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Philosophers and religious adherents who aim to pattern their life after the Absolute reality sometimes claim to have experienced the Absolute. They report [[mystical experience]]s, feelings of oneness, transcendence of their everyday personality or of personhood altogether.

=== Representing the Absolute===
[[File:Yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|200px|The Absolute represented as ''[[Yggdrasill]]'' in [[Germanic paganism|Germanic religion]].]]
The Absolute is conceptually defined as something inexpressible and perhaps unthinkable. This concept creates special problems for expression in words, poetry, mythology, and art. Writers, [[Alex Grey|painters]], storytellers, filmmakers&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Terrence Malick]]'s ''Tree of Life'' and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' are two good examples (one religious, one atheistic) of the use of contradiction to convey the Absolute in the final sequences.&lt;/ref&gt; often use paradox or contradiction because of the "contradictory aspect of the ultimate reality".&lt;ref name="Dadosky, 2004. p. 86"&gt;Dadosky, 2004. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Mircea Eliade]], the Absolute can be mediated or [[revelation|revealed]] through [[symbol]]s.&lt;ref name="Dadosky, 2004. p. 85"&gt;Dadosky, 2004. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; For Eliade the "[[Arche|archaic]]" mind is constantly aware of the presence of the Sacred, and for this mind all symbols are [[religion|religious]] (relinking to the Origin). Through symbols human beings can get an immediate "intuition" of certain features of the inexhaustible Sacred. The mind makes use of images to grasp the ultimate reality of things because reality manifests itself in contradictory ways and therefore can't be described in concepts. It is therefore the image as such, as a whole bundle of meaning, that is "true" (faithful, trustworthy).&lt;ref name="Dadosky, 2004. p. 85"/&gt; Eliade says :&lt;ref&gt;Dadosky, 2004. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the ''sacred'' is equivalent to a ''power'', and, in the last analysis, to ''reality''. The sacred is saturated with ''being''. Sacred power means reality and at the same time enduringness and efficacy. The polarity sacred-profane is often expressed as opposition between real and ''unreal'' or pseudoreal. ''[...]'' Thus it is easy to understand that religious man deeply desires ''to be'', to participate in ''reality'', to be saturated with power.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Common symbols of the Absolute include [[world tree]]s, the [[tree of life]], [[macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], [[fire]], children,&lt;ref&gt;See [[George MacDonald]]'s ''The Golden Key''&lt;/ref&gt; [[circles]], [[mandalas]], and the human body.

[[Access to public information in Europe|Access to public information]] and [[freedom of information]] (FOI) refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' [[accountability]], boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.

On 13 January 2011, the ''[[Verkhovna Rada]]'' (the Parliament of Ukraine) adopted two laws on access to information: The Law of Ukraine “On Access to Public Information”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/laws/ukraine-the-law-on-access-to-public-information.pdf|title=THE LAW OF UKRAINE On Access to Public Information|last=|first=|date=2011|website=article19.org|publisher=Article 19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the new wording of the Law of Ukraine “On Information” (1992).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zakon0.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/2657-12|title=Law No. 2938-VI On Information|last=|first=|date=2011|website=zakon0.rada.gov.ua|publisher=Holos Ukrainy official daily|language=Ukrainian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They entered into force on May 9, 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://merlin.obs.coe.int/iris/2011/3/article30.en.html|title=Ukraine- Law on Access to Public Information Adopted|last=Shevchenko|first=Taras|date=March 2011|website=merlin.obs.coe.int|publisher=IRIS Merlin|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art. 5 of the Law of Ukraine "On Information" provides the «right for information» which includes the possibility of free collection, usage, distribution, storage and protection of information necessary for the exercise of person’s rights, freedoms and legitimate interests&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=3158729|title=The Information Law of Ukraine|last=Kormych|first=Borys|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=Odesa|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Both of the laws were criticized in 2012 by the London-based association advocating for free expression [[Article 19]], which considered that they lack provisions to ensure that the [[Right to privacy|rights to privacy]] and [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] and information are appropriately balanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3391/en/ukraine:-data-protection-act-and-related-legislation|title=Ukraine: Data Protection Act and related legislation|last=|first=|date=July 26, 2012|website=article19.org|publisher=ARTICLE 19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2012/07/ukraine-access-data-laws-criticized-by-article-19/|title=Ukraine Access, Data Laws Criticized by Article 19|last=|first=|date=July 30, 2012|website=freedominfo.org|publisher=Freedominfo.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 9, 2015, the Ukrainian Parliament approved a law to encourage government agencies to release and provide more information from the country’s archive of Soviet-era [[KGB]] files. The information would be transferred to the Institute of National Remembrance and be declassified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2015/04/ukraine-passes-open-data-bill-soviet-files-available/|title=Ukraine Passes Open Data Bill; Soviet Files Available|last=|first=|date=April 30, 2015|website=freedominfo.org|publisher=Freedominfo.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/ukraines-parliament-votes-open-soviet-era-kgb-archives-public-1876756|title=Ukraine’s Parliament Votes To Open Soviet-Era KGB Archives To Public|last=Lynch|first=Dennis|date=September 4, 2015|website=ibtimes.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the same law  encourages to publish free operational data, statistics and reports on government websites and on the national open data web platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.gov.ua/|title=National open data web platform|last=|first=|date=|website=data.gov.ua|language=Ukrainian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2014, the Parliament of Ukraine passed the draft law No. 0947. According to experts, it makes a variety of improvements related to access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cedem.org.ua/en/Analytics/373/|title=Centre for Democracy and Rule of Law (CEDEM)|last=|first=|date=|website=cedem.org.ua|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, fines are added for ungrounded refusals to disclose information, for an untimely or incomplete provision of information, or the provision of false information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2014/04/amendments-approved-ukrainian-access-law/|title=Amendments Approved to Ukrainian Access Law|last=|first=|date=April 18, 2014|website=freedominfo.org|publisher=Freedominfo.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Independent Reporting Mechanism]] (IRM) of the [[Open Government Partnership]] (OPG) organization &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opengovpartnership.org/irm/irm-reports|title=IRM Reports|last=|first=|date=|website=opengovpartnership.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2016, Ukraine’s progress for improving access to information, corruption prevention mechanisms, and bringing citizens in government decision making is “truly impressive”- especially considering the difficult political situation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/open-government-partnership/2016/03/21/new-report-ukraine-finds-progress-access-information|title=NEW REPORT ON UKRAINE FINDS PROGRESS IN ACCESS TO INFORMATION, BUT MORE EFFORTS ARE NEEDED IN GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY|last=|first=|date=March 21, 2016|website=opengovpartnership.org|publisher=Open Government Partnership|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the IRM,  the country fell short in delivering on promises made to improve government accountability and fight corruption. In particular, according to an expert, Ukraine needs to further open public contracting, including in publicly owned enterprises, and to bring more transparency to natural resource extraction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to IRM, also, in its next [[OPG National Plan]], Ukraine should provide for among its commitments for a system of electronic disclosure so that public officials’ assets are verifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opengovpartnership.org/country/ukraine/irm|title=Ukraine- Progress Reports|last=|first=|date=|website=opengovpartnership.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adhimoksha''' (Sanskrit, also ''adhimokṣa''; Pali: ''adhimokkha''; Tibetan Wylie: ''mos pa'') is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term that is translated as "interest", "intensified interest", or "decision". It is defined as holding onto a certain form object; its function is not to lose the object.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 434-440.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Within the Buddhist [[Abhidharma]] teachings, adhimoksha is identified as follows:
* One of the [[Mental_factors_(Buddhism)#Six occasional mental factors|six occasional mental factors]] within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings
* One of the [[Mental_factors_(Buddhism)#Five object-determining mental factors|five object-determining mental factors]] within the Mahayana Abhidharma teachings

==Explanation==
===Theravada===
The [[Visuddhimagga]] ( XIV, 151) gives the following definition of adhimokkha:

:The act of resolving is resolution. It has the characteristic of conviction. Its function is not to grope. It is manifested as decisiveness. Its proximate cause is a thing to be convinced about. It should be regarded as like a boundary-post owing to its immovableness with regard to the object.&lt;ref name=gorkom1&gt;Gorkom (2010), [http://www.zolag.co.uk/Cetasikas/html_node/Determination-and-Energy.html#Determination-and-Energy Definitions of adhimokkha and viriya]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhikkhu Bodhi explains:
:The word adhimokkha means literally the releasing of the mind onto the object. Hence it has been rendered decision or resolution. It has the characteristic of conviction, the function of not groping, and manifestation as decisiveness. Its proximate cause is a thing to be convinced about. It is compared to a stone pillar owing to its unshakable resolve regarding the object.&lt;ref name=bodhi1&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi (2003), pp. 82 [https://books.google.com/books?id=hxopJgv85y4C&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=bhikkhu+bodhi+adhimokkha&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DTKbuH4QN0&amp;sig=tR1EaR337zjoWiETIlbTo-ar9DI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VazzT_DYCO620AGuiMTVBg&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=bhikkhu%20bodhi%20adhimokkha&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahayana===
The [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states: 

:What is intensified interest? It is to stick to the determined thing just as it has been determined, and the function of intensified interest is that it cannot be taken away.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

[[Herbert Guenther]] states:
: It is an awareness by which one stays with what the mind [yul-can] has logically established as this is so and not otherwise. &lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17382">{{redirect|Afford|other meanings|Afford (disambiguation)}}'''Affordance''' is what the environment offers the individual. [[James J. Gibson]], coined the term in his 1966 book, ''The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems'',&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Gibson (1966). ''The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems''. Allen and Unwin, London.&lt;/ref&gt; and it occurs in many of his earlier essays (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Gibson (1975). 'Affordances and behavior'. In E. S. Reed &amp; R. Jones (eds.), ''Reasons for Realism: Selected Essays of James J. Gibson'', pp. 410-411. Lawrence Erlbaum, Hillsdale, NJ, 1 edn.&lt;/ref&gt;). However, his best-known definition is taken from his seminal 1979 book, ''The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception'':{{Quote|The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill. The verb to afford is found in the dictionary, the noun affordance is not. I have made it up. I mean by it something that refers to both the environment and the animal in a way that no existing term does. It implies the complementarity of the animal and the environment.|Gibson (1979, p. 127)&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Gibson (1979). ''The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception''. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH), Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The original definition in psychology includes all transactions that are possible between an individual and their environment. When the concept was applied to design, it started also referring to only those physical action possibilities of which one is aware.

The word is used in a variety of fields: [[perceptual psychology]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[Environmental Psychology|environmental psychology]], [[industrial design]], [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI), [[interaction design]], [[user-centered design]], [[communication studies]], [[instructional design]], [[science, technology and society]] (STS), [[sports science]] and [[artificial intelligence]].

== Original development ==
Psychologist [[James J. Gibson]] developed the concept of affordance over many years, culminating in his final book ''The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception''&lt;ref name=Gibson1979&gt;[[James J. Gibson]] (1979), ''The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception'', {{ISBN|0-89859-959-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1979. He defined an affordance as what the environment provides or furnishes the animal. Notably, Gibson compares an affordance with an [[ecological niche]] emphasizing the way niches characterize how an animal lives in its environment. An affordance is independent of an individual's ability to recognize it or even take advantage of it, and so, should not be confused with a privately perceived world or a [[phenomenology of perception]]. The key to understanding affordance is that it is relational and characterizes the suitability of the environment to the observer, and so, depends on their current intentions and their capabilities. For instance, a set of steps which rises four feet high does not afford climbing to the crawling infant, yet might provide rest to a tired adult or the opportunity to move to another floor for an adult who wished to reach an alternative destination. This notion of intention/needs is critical to an understanding of affordance, as it explains how the same aspect of the environment can provide different affordances to different people, and even to the same individual at another point in time. As Gibson puts it, “Needs control the perception of affordances (selective attention) and also initiate acts.”&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Gibson (1982). Reasons for Realism: Selected Essays of James J. Gibson. Resources for Ecological Psychology. L. Erlbaum, New Jersey. p.411&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson's is the prevalent definition in cognitive psychology.

According to Gibson, humans tend to alter and modify their environment so as to change its affordances to better suit them. On his view, humans change the environment to make it easier to live in (even if making it harder for other animals to live in it): to keep warm, to see at night, to rear children, and to move around. This tendency to change the environment is natural to humans, and Gibson argues that it is a mistake to treat the social world apart from the material world or the tools apart from the natural environment. He points out that manufacturing was originally done by hand as a kind of manipulation.

Gibson argues that learning to perceive an affordance is an essential part of socialization. The theory of affordances introduces a "value-rich ecological object".&lt;ref  name=Gibson1979 /&gt; Affordances cannot be described within the value-neutral language of physics, but rather introduces notions of benefits and injuries to someone. An affordance captures this beneficial/injurious aspect of objects and relates them to the animal for whom they are well/ill-suited. During childhood development, a child learns to perceive not only the affordances for the self, but also how those same objects furnish similar affordances to another. A child can be introduced to the conventional meaning of an object by manipulating which objects command attention and demonstrating how to use the object through performing its central function.&lt;ref name=Williams&amp;Costall2000&gt;Emma Williams and Alan Costall (2000), ''Taking Things More Seriously: Psychological Theories of Autism and the Material-Social Divide'', {{ISBN|0-415-16704-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By learning how to use an artifact, a child “enters into the shared practices of society” as when they learn to use a toilet or brush their teeth.&lt;ref name=Williams&amp;Costall2000 /&gt; And so, by learning the affordances, or conventional meaning of an artifact, children learn the artifact's social world and further, become a member of that world.

Affordances were further studied by [[Eleanor J. Gibson]], wife of [[James J. Gibson]], who created her theory of perceptual learning around this concept. Her book, ''An Ecological Approach to Perceptual Learning and Development'', explores affordances further.

[[Jakob von Uexküll]] had already discussed the concept in the early twentieth century,&lt;ref&gt;Uexküll, Jakob von (1980 [1920 etc.]), ''{{lang|de|Kompositionslehre der Natur}}'', edited by Thure von Uexküll, Frankfurt am Main.&lt;/ref&gt; calling it the "functional tinting" (''{{lang|de|funktionale Tönung}}'') of organisms with respect to stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Foray Into the Worlds of Animals and Humans: With a Theory of Meaning |author =Dorion Sagan |editor1=Jakob von Uexküll |editor2=Marina von Uexküll |editor3=Joseph D. O'Neil |chapter=Introduction: ''Umwelt'' after Uexküll  |page=5 |isbn=9781452903798 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ADSDl6_SeW8C&amp;pg=PA5 |edition = Joseph D O'Neil translation of 1940 |year=2010 |quote=Organisms in their life-worlds recognize not only sensory inputs, but also functional tones, the use they need to make of certain stimuli if they are to do what they need to survive.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson, Yamagishi and Karavia (2002) found that merely looking at an object primes the human brain to perform the action the object affords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1098/rspb.2002.1998 |title= Attentional processes link perception and action |year= 2002 |last1= Anderson |first1= S. J. |last2= Yamagishi |first2= N. |last3= Karavia |first3= V. |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume= 269 |issue= 1497 |pages= 1225|pmc= 1691021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As perceived action possibilities ==
In 1988, [[Donald Norman]] appropriated the term ''affordances'' in the context of [[Human-machine interaction|human–machine interaction]] to refer to just those action possibilities that are readily perceivable by an actor. This new definition of "action possibilities" has now become synonymous with Gibson's work, although Gibson himself never made any reference to action possibilities in any of his writing.&lt;ref&gt;R. Osborne (2015). An ecological approach to educational technology: affordance as a design tool for aligning pedagogy and technology. Ph.D. thesis.&lt;/ref&gt; Through Norman's book ''[[The Design of Everyday Things]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Norman]], ''[[The Design of Everyday Things]],'' {{ISBN|0-465-06710-7}}, originally published under the title ''The Psychology of Everyday Things'' (often abbreviated to ''POET'')&lt;/ref&gt; this interpretation was popularized within the fields of [[Human-Computer Interaction|HCI]], [[interaction design]], and [[user-centered design]]. It makes the concept dependent not only on the physical capabilities of an actor, but also on their goals, beliefs, and past experiences. If an actor steps into a room containing an armchair and a [[softball]], Gibson's original definition of affordances allows that the actor may throw the chair and sit on the ball, because this is objectively possible. Norman's definition of (perceived) affordances captures the likelihood that the actor will sit on the armchair and throw the softball. Effectively, Norman's affordances "suggest" how an object may be interacted with. For example, the size, shape and weight of a softball make it perfect for throwing by humans, and it matches their past experience with similar objects. The focus on perceived affordances is much more pertinent to practical [[design]] problems {{why|date=February 2017}}, which may explain its widespread adoption.

Norman later explained that this restriction of the term's meaning had been unintended, and that he would replace it by "perceived affordance" in any future revision of the book.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Norman|Donald A. Norman]] (1999). Affordance, Conventions and Design. ''Interactions'' 6(3):38-43, May 1999, ACM Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/affordance_conv.html Affordance, Conventions and Design (Part 2)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the definition from his book has been widely adopted in HCI and interaction design, and both meanings are now commonly used in these fields.

Following Norman's adaptation of the concept, ''affordance'' has seen a further shift in meaning where it is used as an [[uncountable noun]], referring to the easy discoverability of an object or system's action possibilities, as in "this button has good affordance".&lt;ref name="preece-1994" /&gt; This in turn has given rise to a use of the verb ''afford'' – from which Gibson's original term was derived – that is not consistent with its dictionary definition (to provide or make available): designers and those in the field of HCI often use ''afford'' as meaning "to suggest" or "to invite".&lt;ref name="lidwell-2003" /&gt;

The different interpretations of affordances, although closely related, can be a source of confusion in writing and conversation if the intended meaning is not made explicit and if the word is not used consistently. Even authoritative textbooks can be inconsistent in their use of the term.&lt;ref name="preece-1994"&gt;''Human–Computer Interaction'', Preece et al. (1994, p. 6): The authors explicitly define perceived affordances as being a subset of all affordances, but another meaning is used later in the same paragraph by talking about "good affordance."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lidwell-2003"&gt;''Universal Principles of Design'', Lidwell, Holden &amp; Butler (2003, p. 20): The authors first explain that round wheels are better suited for rolling than square ones and therefore better afford (i.e. allow) rolling, but later state that a door handle "affords" (i.e. suggests) pulling, but not pushing.&lt;/ref&gt;

When affordances are used to describe [[information and communications technology]] (ICT) an analogy is created with everyday objects with their attendant features and functions.&lt;ref name=Faraj&amp;Azad2012&gt;Faraj, S., &amp; Azad, B. (2012). The Materiality of Technology: an Affordance Perspective. In ''Materiality and Organizing: Social Interaction in a Technological World''. {{ISBN|9780199664054}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, ICT's features and functions derive from the product classifications of its developers and designers. This approach emphasizes an artifact’s convention to be wholly located in how it was designed to be used. In contrast, affordance theory draws attention to the fit of the technology to the activity of the user and so lends itself to studying how ICTs may be appropriated by users or even misused.&lt;ref name=Faraj&amp;Azad2012/&gt; One meta-analysis reviewed the evidence from a number of surveys about the extent to which the Internet is transforming or enhancing community. The studies showed that the internet is used for connectivity locally as well as globally, although the nature of its use varies in different countries. It found that internet use is adding on to other forms of communication, rather than replacing them.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Wellman, Anabel Quan-Haase, Jeffrey Boase, Wenhong Chen, Keith Hampton, Isabel Diaz de Isla and Kakuko Miyata. 2003. [ [http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol8/issue3/wellman.html] "The Social Affordances of the Internet for Networked Individualism."] ''Journal of Computer Mediated Communication'' 8, 3 (April)&lt;/ref&gt;

== False affordances ==
William Gaver&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1145/108844.108856 |chapter=Technology affordances |title=Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems Reaching through technology - CHI '91 |year=1991 |last1=Gaver |first1=William W. |isbn=0897913833 |pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; divided affordances into three categories: perceptible, hidden, and false.

* A '''false affordance''' is an apparent affordance that does not have any real function, meaning that the actor perceives nonexistent possibilities for action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/affordances.html "Affordances"]&lt;/ref&gt; A good example of a false affordance is a [[placebo button]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://architectures.danlockton.co.uk/2008/10/01/placebo-buttons-false-affordances-and-habit-forming/ "Placebo buttons, false affordances and habit-forming"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A '''hidden affordance''' indicates that there are possibilities for action, but these are not perceived by the actor. For example, it is not apparent from looking at a shoe that it could be used to open a wine bottle.
* For an affordance to be '''perceptible''', there is information available such that the actor perceives and can then act upon the existing affordance.

This means that, when affordances are perceptible, they offer a direct link between perception and action, and, when affordances are hidden or false, they can lead to mistakes and misunderstandings.

'''Anal expulsiveness''' is the state of a person who exhibits cruelty, emotional outbursts, disorganization, self-confidence, artistic ability, generosity, rebelliousness and general carelessness.&lt;ref name="Sharan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kosslyn|first=S.|authorlink=Stephen Kosslyn|others=Rosenberg, R.|year=2004|title='Psychology: The brain, the person, the world|edition=2nd|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Pearson Education|ISBN=978-0-205-37609-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]] theory claims the [[anal stage]] follows the [[oral stage]] of infant/early-childhood development. This is a time when an infant's attention moves from oral stimulation to anal stimulation (usually the bowels but occasionally the bladder), usually synchronous with learning to control their excretory functions, a time of [[toilet training]].  For a child in this stage of development, control of [[bowel movements]] is the stage at which the child can express autonomy by withholding, refusing to comply, or soiling himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Magnavita|first=Jeffrey J.|title=Theories of Personality: Contemporary Approaches to the Science of Personality|page=90|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2002|ISBN=0-471-37890-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2E3aXMMHoFQC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=Anal+expulsive&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Q1XMTOfjDY3rOabm9bAB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Anal%20expulsive&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicts with [[bullying]] parents regarding [[toilet training]] can produce a [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]] in this stage, which can manifest itself in adulthood by a continuation of erotic pleasure in defecation.&lt;ref name="Sharan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharan|first=A.K.|title=

'''Awareness''' is the ability to directly know and [[perception|perceive]], to feel, or to be cognizant of events. More broadly, it is the state of being [[consciousness|conscious]] of something.

==Concept==
Awareness is a relative [[concept]]. It may be focused on an internal state, such as a visceral feeling, or on external events by way of sensory perception.

==Self-awareness==
{{Main|Self-awareness}}
Popular ideas about [[consciousness]] suggest the phenomenon describes a condition of being aware of oneself (self-awareness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/self-awareness|title=Definition of SELF-AWARENESS|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to describe consciousness in [[neurological]] terms have focused on describing networks in the [[brain]] that develop awareness of the [[qualia]] developed by other networks.&lt;ref name=ed1998&gt;{{Cite book |year=1998 |title=Self-awareness: its nature and development |pages=12–13 |isbn=1-57230-317-4 |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuroscience==
Neural systems that regulate [[attention]] serve to attenuate awareness among complex animals whose [[central nervous system|central]] and [[peripheral nervous system]] provides more information than [[cognition|cognitive]] areas of the brain can assimilate. Within an attenuated system of awareness, a [[mind]] might be aware of much more than is being contemplated in a focused [[extended consciousness]].

===Basic awareness===
Basic awareness of one's internal and external world depends on the [[brain stem]]. Bjorn Merker,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20070915/bob9.asp Consciousness in the Raw], Science News Online, September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; an independent neuroscientist in Stockholm, Sweden, argues that the brain stem supports an elementary form of conscious thought in infants with [[hydranencephaly]]. "Higher" forms of awareness including [[self-awareness]] require cortical contributions, but "primary consciousness" or "basic awareness" as an ability to integrate sensations from the environment with one's immediate goals and feelings in order to guide behavior, springs from the brain stem which human beings share with most of the [[vertebrates]]. Psychologist [[Carroll Izard]] emphasizes that this form of primary [[consciousness]] consists of the capacity to generate emotions and awareness of one's surroundings, but not an ability to talk about what one has experienced. In the same way, people can become conscious of a feeling that they can't label or describe, a phenomenon that's especially common in pre-verbal infants.

Due to this discovery medical definitions of [[brain death]] as a lack of [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] activity face a serious challenge.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Basic interests===
Down the brain stem lie interconnected regions that regulate the direction of [[human eye|eye]] gaze and organize decisions about what to do next, such as reaching for a piece of food or pursuing a potential mate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Changes in awareness===
The ability to consciously detect an image when presented at near-threshold stimulus varies across presentations. One factor is "baseline shifts" due to top down attention that modulates ongoing brain activity in sensory cortex areas that affects the neural processing of subsequent perceptual judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sylvester CM, Shulman GL, Jack AI, Corbetta M |title=Asymmetry of anticipatory activity in visual cortex predicts the locus of attention and perception |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=27 |issue=52 |pages=14424–33 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18160650 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3759-07.2007 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/reprint/27/52/14424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such top down biasing can occur through two distinct processes: an attention driven baseline shift in the [[alpha wave]]s, and a decision bias reflected in [[gamma wave]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Wyart | first1 = V.| last2 = Tallon-Baudry | first2 = C. | title = How Ongoing Fluctuations in Human Visual Cortex Predict Perceptual Awareness: Baseline Shift versus Decision Bias| journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 29| issue = 27 | pages = 8715–8725 | date=July 2009 | pmid = 19587278 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0962-09.2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Living systems view==
Outside of [[neuroscience]] biologists, [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]] contributed their [[Santiago theory of cognition]] in which they wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Living systems are cognitive systems, and living as a process is a process of cognition. This statement is valid for all organisms, with or without a nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Capra, Fritjof |authorlink=Fritjof Capra |title=The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems |publisher=Anchor Books |location=Garden City, N.Y |year=1996 |isbn=0-385-47676-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This theory contributes a perspective that cognition is a process present at organic levels that we don't usually consider to be aware. Given the possible relationship between awareness and [[cognition]], and [[consciousness]], this theory contributes an interesting perspective in the [[philosophical]] and [[scientific]] dialogue of awareness and [[living systems theory]].

==Communications and information systems==

In cooperative settings, awareness is a term used to denote “knowledge created through the interaction of an agent and its environment — in simple terms ‘knowing what is going on’”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gutwin|first1=Carl|last2=Greenberg|first2=Saul|title=A Descriptive Framework of Workspace Awareness for Real-Time Groupware|journal=Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)|date=September 2002|volume=11|issue=3-4|pages=411–446|doi=10.1023/A:1021271517844}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In this setting, awareness is meant to convey how individuals monitor and perceive the information surrounding their colleagues and the environment they are in. This information is incredibly useful and critical to the performance and success of collaborations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dourish|first1=Paul|last2=Bellotti|first2=Victoria|title=Awareness and Coordination in Shared Workspaces|journal=Computer Supported Cooperative Work|date=1992|issue=November|pages=107–114|doi=10.1145/143457.143468}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=Kjeld|title=The problem with 'awareness': Introductory remarks on 'awareness in CSCW'|journal=Computer Supported Cooperative Work|date=2002|volume=11|issue=3-4|pages=285–298|doi=10.1023/A:1021272909573}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Awareness can be further defined by breaking it down into a set of characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gutwin|first1=Carl|last2=Greedberg|first2=Saul|title=A framework of awareness for small groups in sharedworkspace groupware|date=1999|publisher=Department of Computer Science|location=University of Saskatchewan, Canada|edition=Technical Report 99-1|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is knowledge about the state of some environment
* Environments are continually changing, therefore awareness knowledge must be constantly maintained 
* Individuals interact with the environment, and maintenance of awareness is accomplished through this interaction. 
* It is generally part of some other activity – generally making it a secondary goal to the primary goal of the activity.

Different categories of awareness have been suggested based on the type of information being obtained or maintained:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenberg|first1=Saul|last2=Gutwin|first2=Carl|last3=Cockburn|first3=Andy|title=Awareness Through Fisheye Views in Relaxed-WYSIWIS Groupware|journal=Proceedings of the conference on Graphics interface '96|date=1996|pages=28–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Informal awareness is the sense of who’s around and what are they up to. E.g. Information you might know from being collocated with an individual 
* Social awareness is the information you maintain about a social or conversational context. This is a subtle awareness maintained through non-verbal cues, such as eye contact, facial express, etc.  
* Group-structural awareness is the knowledge of others roles, responsibilities, status in a group. It is an understanding of group dynamics and the relationship another individual has to the group.  
* Workspace awareness – this is a focus on the workspace’s influence and mediation of awareness information, particularly the location, activity, and changes of elements within the workspace.

These categories are not mutually exclusive, as there can be significant overlap in what a particular type of awareness might be considered. Rather, these categories serve to help understand what knowledge might be conveyed by a particular type of awareness or how that knowledge might be conveyed. Workspace awareness is of particular interest to the [[Computer-supported cooperative work|CSCW]] community, due to the transition of workspaces from physical to virtual environments.

While the type of awareness above refers to knowledge a ''person'' might need in a particular situation, ''[[context awareness]]'' and ''[[location awareness]]'' refer to information a ''computer system'' might need in a particular situation. These concepts of large importance especially for AAA ([[authentication]], [[authorization]], [[accounting]]) applications.

The term of location awareness still is gaining momentum with the growth of ubiquitous computing. First defined by networked work positions ([[network location awareness]]), it has been extended to mobile phones and other mobile communicable entities. The term covers a common interest in whereabouts of remote entities, especially individuals and their cohesion in operation. The term of context awareness is a superset including the concept of location awareness. It extends the awareness to context features of an operational target as well as to the context of an operational area.

==Covert awareness== &lt;!-- This section was merged and is linked from redirect "Covert awareness" --&gt;
{{See also|Blindsight}}
Covert awareness is the knowledge of something without knowing it. Some patients with specific [[brain damage]] are for example unable to tell if a pencil is horizontal or vertical.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} They are however able to grab the pencil, using the correct orientation of the hand and wrist. This condition implies that some of the knowledge the mind possesses is delivered through alternate channels than conscious intent.{{or|date=August 2009}}

==Other uses==
Awareness forms a basic concept of the theory and practice of [[Gestalt therapy]].

In general, "awareness" may also refer to public or common knowledge or understanding about a social, scientific, or political issue, and hence many movements try to foster "awareness" of a given subject, that is, "[[raising awareness]]". Examples include [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] awareness and [[multicultural]] awareness.

Awareness may refer to [[anesthesia awareness]].

'''Biopolitics''' is an intersectional field between biology and politics. It is a political wisdom taking into consideration the administration of life and a locality’s populations as its subject. To quote Foucault, it is ‘to ensure, sustain, and multiply life, to put this life in order."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://criticallegalthinking.com/2017/05/10/michel-foucault-biopolitics-biopower/#fn-22546-9|title=History of Sexuality (The Will to Knowledge: History of Sexuality)|last=Foucault|first=Michael|publisher=|year=1976|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by [[Rudolf Kjellén]], who also coined the term [[geopolitics]],&lt;ref name="Esposito2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Roberto Esposito]]|title=Bios: Biopolitics and Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIZS2GpUzGwC&amp;pg=PA16|year=2008|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-4989-1|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his 1905 two-volume work ''The Great Powers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunneflo|first=Markus|year=2015|url=https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/014e3f7b-0a6b-4535-8e83-d04a04d2008c|title=Rudolf Kjellén: Nordic biopolitics before the welfare state|journal=[[Retfærd]]|volume=35|issue=3|issn=0105-1121}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary US [[political science]] studies, usage of the term is mostly divided between a [[Post-structuralism|poststructuralist]] group using the meaning assigned by [[Michel Foucault]] (denoting social and political power over life) and another group who uses it to denote studies relating [[biology and political science]].&lt;ref name="Liesen"&gt;Liesen, Laurette T. and Walsh, Mary Barbara, The Competing Meanings of 'Biopolitics' in Political Science: Biological and Post-Modern Approaches to Politics (2011). APSA 2011 Annual Meeting Paper {{ssrn|1902949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Various definitions==
#In Kjellén's [[organicism|organicist]] view, the [[State (polity)|state]] was a quasi-biological organism, a "super-individual creature". Kjellén sought to study "the civil war between social groups" (comprising the state) from a biological perspective and thus named his putative discipline "biopolitics".&lt;ref name="Lemke2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Thomas Lemke]]|title=Biopolitics: An Advanced Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cRVNFqFPGtoC&amp;pg=PA9|year=2011|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-5241-8|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[Nazi]]s also used the term occasionally. For example, [[Hans Conrad Julius Reiter|Hans Reiter]] used it in a 1934 speech to refer to their biologically based concept of nation and state and ultimately their [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial policy]].&lt;ref name="Liesen"/&gt;
#Previous notions of the concept can actually be traced back to the [[Middle Ages]] in [[John of Salisbury]]'s work ''[[Policraticus]]'' in which the coined term [[body politic]] is actually used. The first modern usage of the term (in English) starts with an article written by GW Harris in an article for the ''New Age'' in 1911 in which he advocates the liquidation of "lunatics" by 'state lethal chamber'.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Age'' 28 December 1911&lt;/ref&gt; The concept then starts to gather pace in the 19th century with [[Walter Bagehot]]'s work ''[[Physics and Politics]]'' in which he reflects on the term as if he was a trained scientist in the form of [[Jakob von Uexküll]]. Bagehot didn't have a scientifically trained mind such as von Uexküll so he (Bagehot) falls rather short in the explanation of the term. Nevertheless the book has some novel points particularly on the subject of [[natural selection]] and politics.&lt;ref&gt; Walter Bagehot Physics and Politics pp. 40-65 1872&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Morley Roberts]] in his 1938 book ''Bio-politics'' used to argue that a correct model for [[Geopolitics|world politics]] is "a loose association of cell and protozoa colonies".&lt;ref name="Liesen"/&gt;
#[[Robert E. Kuttner]] used the term to refer to his particular brand of "scientific racism," as he called it, which he worked out with noted [[Eustace Mullins]], with whom Kuttner cofounded the [[Institute for Biopolitics]] in the late 1950s, and also with [[Glayde Whitney]], a behavioral geneticist. Most of his [[Opposition (politics)|adversaries]] designate his model as antisemitic. Kuttner and Mullins were inspired by [[Morley Roberts]], who was in turn inspired by [[Arthur Keith]], or both were inspired by each other and either co-wrote together (or with the Institute of Biopolitics) ''Biopolitics of Organic Materialism'' dedicated to Roberts and reprinted some of his works.&lt;ref name="Jackson2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=John P.

== In the colonial setting ==
Catastrophes are periodically mobilized as vehicles for historical transformation. European states often found themselves grappling with sociobiological propensities of populations. Mercantilism and capitalist modes of production led to a modern biopolitical approach to famine: the modern state depended on providing a diet sufficient to keep the biological machines of industrial capitalism running. The British developed biopolitics in tandem with colonization to help solidify their control over the Irish. 

The French Third Republic in Western Africa also employed biopolitics in their colonial efforts. The ''fin-de-siecle'' revolution in microbiology and specific developments in public health legislation aided the French. Furthermore, thanks to the germ theory of disease pioneered by Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur, the etiology of some of the most deadly diseases—cholera and typhoid—began to be understood in the 1890s, and the French used this new scientific knowledge in the tropics of West Africa. Illnesses like bubonic plague were isolated, and vectors of malaria and yellow fever were identified for the political purpose of public health. They passed public health laws to introduce up-to-date health standards. The goal was for African subjects to respond in exactly the same way as metropolitan citizens to market incentives and new technologies imposed by a progressive state. Thus, public health was a political concern in the sense that the state hoped citizens would be more productive if they lived longer.

French philosopher and social theorist [[Michel Foucault]] first discussed his thoughts on biopolitics in his lecture series "Society Must Be Defended" given at the [[Collège de France]] from 1975 to 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Society Must Be Defended|last = Michel|first = Foucault|publisher = Picador|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = 242–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foucault's concept of biopolitics is largely derived from his own notion of [[biopower]], and the extension of [[Political power|state power]] over both the physical and political bodies of a population.  While only mentioned briefly in his "Society Must Be Defended" lectures, his notion of the concept of biopolitics (Foucault never invented the concept) has become prominent in social and humanistic sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, T., Casper, M. J., &amp; Moore, L. J. (2011). Biopolitics: an advanced introduction. NYU Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foucault described biopolitics as "a new technology of power...[that] exists at a different level, on a different scale, and [that] has a different bearing area, and makes use of very different instruments."&lt;ref name="Foucault 1997 242"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Society Must Be Defended: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1975-1976|year=1997|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0312422660|pages=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than a disciplinary mechanism, Foucault's biopolitics acts as a control apparatus exerted over a population as a whole or, as Foucault stated, "a global mass."&lt;ref name="Foucault 1997 242"/&gt; In the years that followed, Foucault continued to develop his notions of the biopolitical in his "The Birth of Biopolitics" and "The Courage of Truth" lectures.&lt;ref&gt;[[Woodrow Wilson]] (1918) The New Freedom pp.45-48 Englewood Cliffs, N.J., Prentice-Hall&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault (2007) Security, Territory, Population 1977-1978 pp. 311-332 pp. 333-361 pp. 378-380&lt;/ref&gt; 

Foucault gave numerous examples of biopolitical control when he first mentioned the concept in 1976.  These examples include "ratio of births to deaths, the rate of reproduction, the fertility of a population, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Society Must Be Defended: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1975-1976|year=1997|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0312422660|pages=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contrasted this method of social control with political power in the Middle Ages. Whereas in the Middle Ages pandemics made death a permanent and perpetual part of life, this was then shifted around the end of the 18th century with the introduction of [[Milieu intérieur|milieu]] into the [[Biological Sciences|biological sciences]]. Foucault then gives different contrasts to the then [[Physical Sciences|physical sciences]] in which the [[industrialisation]] of the population was coming to the fore through the concept of work, where Foucault then argues power starts to become a target for this milieu by the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Security, Territory, Population Lectures At The College de France|last=Michel|first=Foucault|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=55-86, 20, 27 (Note 37)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Society Must Be Defended|last=Michel|first=Foucault|publisher=|year=1975|isbn=|location=|pages=241-244, 252}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of vaccines and medicines dealing with public hygiene allowed death to be held (and/or withheld) from certain populations.  This was the introduction of "more subtle, more rational mechanisms: insurance, individual and collective savings, safety measures, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Society Must Be Defended: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1975-1976|year=1997|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0312422660|pages=243–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1120">A '''charisticary''' is a person to whom is given the enjoyment of the revenues of a monastery, hospital, or benefice, also known as a ''comendatory'' or ''donatory''.

The charisticaries among the [[Ancient Greeks]] were a kind of donatories who enjoyed all the revenues of hospitals and monasteries, without giving an account thereof to any person. [[iconoclasm|Iconoclast]]s who have abused this in the past include [[Constantine Copronymus]], the avowed enemy of the monks, whose monasteries he gave away to strangers.

In later times, the emperors and patriarchs gave many to upper-class people, not by way of gift, to reap any temporal advantage from; but to repair, beautify, and patronize them. Eventually, those in good condition were given, especially such as were rich; and at last they were all given away, rich and poor, those of men and of women; and that to laymen and married men.

[[Jean-Baptiste Cotelier]], in his ''Ecclesiae Graecae Monumenta'', gives the form of these donations: they were given for life, or sometimes for two lives.

A '''crash simulation''' is a [[Virtuality|virtual]] recreation of a destructive [[crash test]] of a [[car]] or a highway [[Traffic barrier|guard rail system]] using a [[computer simulation]] in order to examine the level of safety of the car and its occupants. Crash [[simulation]]s are used by [[automaker]]s during [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) analysis for [[crashworthiness]] in the [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) process of modelling new cars. During a crash simulation, the [[kinetic energy]], or energy of motion, that a [[vehicle]] has before the impact is transformed into [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] [[energy]], mostly by [[plastic deformation]] ([[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]]) of the car body material ([[Body in White]]), at the end of the impact.

Data obtained from a crash simulation indicate the capability of the car body or guard rail structure to protect the vehicle occupants during a [[collision]] (and also [[pedestrian]]s hit by a car) against [[injury]]. Important results are the deformations (for example, [[steering wheel]] intrusions) of the occupant space (driver, [[passenger]]s) and the [[deceleration]]s (for example, head acceleration) felt by them, which must fall below threshold values fixed in legal [[car safety]] [[regulations]]. To model real crash tests, today's crash simulations include virtual models of [[crash test dummy|crash test dummies]] and of passive safety devices ([[seat belts]], [[airbags]], shock absorbing [[dash boards]], etc.). Guide rail tests evaluate vehicle deceleration and rollover potential, as well as penetration of the barrier by vehicles.

== Origin ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:PLANE CRASH1a.JPG|thumb|right|Simulation of an aircraft impact on a nuclear power plant (program HEMP-ESI)]] --&gt;
In the years 1970 attempts were made to simulate car crash events with [[non-linear]] spring-mass systems after [[calibration]], which require as an input the results of physical destructive laboratory tests, needed to determine the mechanical crushing behavior of each spring component of the modeled system.  "[[First principle]]" simulations like more elaborate finite element models, however, need only the definition of the structural geometry and the basic material properties ([[rheology]] of car body steel, glass, plastic parts, etc.) as an input to generate the numerical model.

The origins of industrial first principle computerized car crash simulation lie in [[military defense]], [[outer space]] and civil [[nuclear power plant]] applications. Upon presentation of a simulation of the accidental crash of a military [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] plane into a nuclear power plant on May 30, 1978 by [http://www.esi-group.com ESI Group] in a meeting organized by the [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure]] (VDI) in [[Stuttgart]], car makers became alerted to the possibility of using this technology for the simulation of destructive car crash tests (Haug 1981).

[[Image:POLO1a.JPG|thumb|left|The first successful frontal full car crash simulation: a Volkswagen Polo collided with a rigid concrete barrier at 50 km/h (ESI 1986).]]
In the following years, German car makers produced more complex crash simulation studies, simulating the crash behavior of individual car body components, component assemblies, and quarter and half car bodies in white ([[Body in White|BIW]]). These experiments culminated in a joint project by the Forschungsgemeinschaft Automobil-Technik (FAT), a conglomeration of all seven German car makers ([[Audi]], [[BMW]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Opel]], [[Porsche]], and [[Volkswagen]]), which tested the applicability of two emerging commercial crash simulation codes. These simulation codes recreated a frontal impact of a full passenger car structure (Haug 1986) and they ran to completion on a computer overnight. Now that turn-around time between two consecutive job-submissions (computer runs) did not exceed one day, engineers were able to make efficient and progressive improvements of the crash behavior of the analyzed car body structure.

== Application ==
Crash simulations are used to investigate the [[safety]] of the car occupants during impacts on the front end structure of the car in a "[[head-on collision]]" or "frontal impact", the lateral structure of the car in a “[[side collision]]” or “side impact”, the rear end structure of a car in a "[[rear-end collision]]" or “rear impact”, and the roof structure of the car when it overturns during a "[[rollover]]". Crash simulations can also be used to assess injury to [[pedestrians]] hit by a car.

== Benefits ==
A crash simulation produces results without actual [[destructive testing]] of a new car model. This way, tests can be performed quickly and inexpensively in a computer, which permits optimization of the design before a real prototype of the car has been manufactured. Using a simulation, problems can be solved before spending time and money on an actual crash test. The great flexibility of [[Printing|printed]] output and [[graphical display]] enables designers to solve some problems that would have been nearly impossible without the help of a computer.

== Analysis ==
[[Image:Thin Shell FE.JPG|thumb|right|340px|A subdivision of the metal exterior of the car, called a finite element, is connected to nodes at each vertex.]] 
Large number of crash simulations use a method of analysis called the [[Finite Element Method]]. The complex problems are solved by dividing a surface into a large but still finite number of elements and determining the motion of these elements over very small periods of time. Another approach to crash simulations is performed by application of [[Macro Element Method]]. The difference between two mentioned above methodologies is that the structure in case of Macro Element Method consists of smaller number of elements. The calculation algorithm of structure deformation is based on experimental data rather than calculated from partial differential equations.
 
Pam-Crash started crash simulation and together with [[LS-DYNA]] is a software package which is widely used for application of Finite Element Method. This method allows detailed modeling of a structure, but the disadvantage lies in high processing unit requirements and calculation time. 
The Visual Crash Studio uses Macro Element Methodology. In comparison with FEM it has some modeling and boundary condition limitations but its application does not require advanced computers and the calculation time is incomparably smaller. Two presented methods complement each other. Macro Element Method is useful at early stage of the structure design process while Finite Element Method performs well at its final stages.

=== Structural analysis ===
In a typical crash simulation, the car body structure is analyzed using spatial [[discretization]], that is,  breaking up the continuous movement of the body in real time into smaller changes in position over small, discrete time steps. The discretization involves subdividing the surface of the constituent, thin, [[sheet metal]] parts into a large number (approaching one million in 2006) of [[quadrilateral]] or triangular regions, each of which spans the area between "nodes" to which its corners are fixed. Each element has mass, which is distributed as concentrated masses and as [[moment of inertia|mass moments of inertia]] to its connecting nodes. Each node has 6 kinematic [[degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]], that is,  one node can move in three linear directions under [[translation (physics)|translation]] and can [[rotation|rotate]] about three independent axes. The spatial [[coordinates]] (''x''), [[displacement (distance)|displacement]] (''u''), [[velocity]] (''v''), and [[acceleration]] (''a'') of each node is mostly expressed in a three-dimensional rectangular [[Cartesian coordinate system]] with axes ''X'',''Y'', and ''Z''.

If the nodes move during a crash simulation, the connected elements move, stretch, and bend with their nodes, which causes them to impart forces and [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] to their nodal connections. The forces and moments at the nodes correspond to the inertia forces and moments, caused by their translational (linear) and [[angular acceleration]]s and to the forces and moments transmitted by the [[strength of materials|resistance]] of the structural material of the connected elements as they deform. Sometimes, additional external [[structural loads]] are applied, like gravity loads from the self weight of the parts, or added loads from external masses.

The forces and moments of all nodes are collected into a [[column vector]] (or column matrix), and the time dependent [[equation of motion|equations of motion]] (in dynamic equilibrium) can be written as follows.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Ma} = \mathbf{F}_{ext} - \mathbf{F}_{int}&lt;/math&gt; 
where vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Ma}&lt;/math&gt;  (mass times acceleration vector) collects the inertia forces at the nodes, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{ext}&lt;/math&gt; collects the external nodal loads, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{int}&lt;/math&gt; collects the internal resisting forces from the deformation of the material. ''M'' is a [[diagonal matrix]] of the nodal masses.  Each vector (''u'', ''v'', ''a'', ''F'', etc.) has [[dimension]] 6 times the total number of nodes in the crash model (about 6 million “[[degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]]” for every 1 million "nodes" in 3-D thin shell finite element models).

=== Time analysis ===
A crash simulation uses time discretization as well to separate the continuous changes in time into very small, usable segments. The dynamic [[equations of motion]] hold at all times during a crash simulation and must be integrated in time, ''t'', starting from an [[initial condition]] at time zero, which is just prior to the crash. According to the explicit [[finite difference]] [[time integration method]] used by most crash codes, the accelerations, velocities, and displacements of the body are related by the following equations.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_{n} = \mathbf{M}^{-1}(\mathbf{F}_{ext} - \mathbf{F}_{int})_n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_{n+1/2} = \mathbf{v}_{n-1/2} + \mathbf{a}_{n}\Delta t_n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_{n+1} = \mathbf{u}_n + \mathbf{v}_{n+1/2}\Delta t_{n+1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
In these equations the subscripts ''n''±1/2, ''n'', ''n''+1 denote past, present, and future times, ''t'', at half and full-time intervals with time steps &lt;math&gt;\Delta t_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta t_{n+1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

=== Solution ===
The above [[system of linear equations]] is solved for the accelerations, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_{n}&lt;/math&gt;, the velocities, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_{n+1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, and the displacements, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, at each discrete point in time, ''t'', during the crash [[interval (time)|duration]]. This solution is trivial, since the mass matrix is diagonal. The computer time is proportional to the number of finite elements and the number of solution time steps. The stable solution time step, &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;, is limited for [[numerical stability]], as expressed by the [[Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition]] (CFL), which states that “in any time-marching computer simulation, the time step must be less than the time for some significant action to occur, and preferably considerably less." In a crash simulation, the fastest significant actions are the acoustic signals that travel inside the structural material.

The solid elastic stress wave speed amounts to
:&lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{E_0/\rho}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial elastic modulus (before [[plastic deformation]]) of the material and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the mass density. The largest stable time step for a given material is therefore
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t = d_{min}\sqrt{\rho/E_0}&lt;/math&gt;, 
where &lt;math&gt;d_{min}&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest distance between any two nodes of the numerical crash simulation model.

Since this distance can change during a simulation, the stable time step changes and must be updated continually as the solution proceeds in time. When using [[steel]], the typical value of the stable time step is about one [[microsecond]] when the smallest discrete node distance in the mesh of the finite element model is about 5 millimeters. It needs then more than 100,000 time intervals to solve a crash event that lasts for one tenth of a second. This figure is exceeded in many industrial crash models demanding optimized crash solvers with High-Performance Computing ([[High-performance computing|HPC]]) features, such as [[Array programming|vectorization]] and [[parallel computing]].

[[File:A simple example ERIL diagram.png|thumb|right|An example ERIL diagram with 3 classes and 3 one-to-many relationships.]]

'''ERIL''' ('''Entity-Relationship and Inheritance Language''') is a [[visual language]] for representing the data structure of a computer system.
As its name suggests, ERIL is based on [[Entity–relationship model|entity-relationship]] diagrams and [[class diagram]]s.
ERIL combines the [[Relational data model|relational]] and [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] approaches to [[data model]]ing.

== Overview ==
ERIL can be seen as a set of guidelines aimed at improving the readability of structure diagrams.
These guidelines were borrowed from [[DRAKON]], a variant of [[flowchart]]s created within the Russian space program.
ERIL itself was developed by Stepan Mitkin.

The ERIL guidelines for drawing diagrams:
* Lines must be straight, either strictly vertical or horizontal.
* Vertical lines mean ownership ([[Object composition|composition]]).
* Horizontal lines mean peer relationships ([[Object composition#Aggregation|aggregation]]).
* Line intersections are not allowed.
* It is not recommended to fit the whole data model on a single diagram. Draw many simple diagrams instead.
* The same class (table) can appear several times on the same diagram.    
* Use the following standard symbols to indicate the type of the relationship.
** One-to-one: a simple line.
** One-to-many, two-way: a line with a "paw".
** One-to-many, one-way: an arrow.
** Many-to-many: a line with two "paws".    
* Do not lump together inheritance and data relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://drakon-editor.sourceforge.net/eril.html ERIL: a Visual Language for Data Modelling]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indexes ==
A class (table) in ERIL can have several indexes.
Each index in ERIL can include one or more fields, similar to indexes in [[relational database]]s.
ERIL indexes are logical. They can optionally be implemented by real data structures.

== Links ==
Links between classes (tables) in ERIL are implemented by the so-called "link" fields.
Link fields can be of different types according to the link type:
* reference;
* collection of references.
    
Example: there is a one-to-many link between ''Documents'' and ''Lines''. One ''Document'' can have many ''Lines''. Then the ''Document.Lines'' field is a collection of references to the lines that belong to the document. ''Line.Document'' is a reference to the document that contains the line.

Link fields are also logical. They may or may not be implemented physically in the system.

== Usage ==

ERIL is supposed to model any kind of data regardless of the storage. 
The same ERIL diagram can represent data stored in a [[relational database]], in a [[Nosql|NoSQL]] database, [[Xml|XML]] file or in the memory.

ERIL diagrams serve two purposes.
The primary purpose is to explain the data structure of an existing or future system or component.
The secondary purpose is to automatically generate source code from the model.
Code that can be generated includes specialized collection classes, hash and comparison functions, data retrieval and modification procedures, [[Data definition language|SQL data-definition]] code, etc. Code generated from ERIL diagrams can ensure referential and uniqueness [[data integrity]].
Serialization code of different kinds can also be automatically generated.

'''Eduardo Kac''' [ɛdwardoʊ kæts; ĕd·wâr′·dō kăts] (1962) is an American contemporary [[artist]] and professor whose artworks that span a wide range of practices, including [[performance art]], poetry, [[holography]], [[interactive art]], telematic art and transgenic art. He is particularly well known for his works that integrate [[biotechnology]], politics and aesthetics. 

Kac began his art career in the early 1980s as performance artist in [[Rio De Janeiro, Brazil]]. Within a few years he was involved in exploring holography as an interactive art form. At the same time, he began creating animated poetic works on the French Minitel platform.  

Before moving from Brazil to the United States in the late 1980s, Kac began creating his first telematic artworks that used electronic technologies to bridge two or more physical locations. During the 1990s he continued to produce these works, at the same time as he coined the phrase ''bioart''. In addition to ''bioart'' Kac coined numerous neologisms to describe his transdisciplinary art practice, including ''holoart'', ''transgenic art'' (the integration of human genes in an artwork) and ''plantimal'', referring to a plant infused with human genes.&lt;ref name="artnexus"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kalenberg|first=Ángel|title=Eduardo Kac: The Artist as Demiurge|url=http://www.artnexus.com/Notice_View.aspx?DocumentID=19376}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Kac is perhaps best known for his transgenic artworks that use biotechnology to intervene on the natural genetic structure of plants and animals. His works ''Time Capsule'', ''GFP Bunny'' and ''Natural History of the Enigma'' in particular are recognized as notable works for having joined biotechnology, art and bioethics together into politically charged artworks. 

In 2017 Kac collaborated with the French Space Observatory office to have a sculpture made aboard the [[international space station]]. 

A multidisciplinary artist, Kac has also employed poetry, fax, photocopying, photography, video, fractals, poetry, RFID implants, virtual reality, networks, robotics, satellites, telerobotics, Morse code and DNA extraction in his practice.&lt;ref name="artnexus"/&gt; 


==Life==
Kac was born July 3, 1962 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.&lt;ref name="Brittanica"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Eduardo-Kac|title=Eduardo Kac - Brazilian American artist|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kostelanetz2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Kostelanetz|title=A Dictionary of the Avant-Gardes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tsq6NDST_b0C&amp;pg=RA2-PT245|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-136-80620-2|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the School of Communications of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, receiving a BA degree in 1985,&lt;ref name="Brittanica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.duke.edu/art/newsbyte/2011/1014.html|title=NewsByte - Duke Art, Art History and Visual Studies|website=web.duke.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] where he received an MFA degree in 1990.&lt;ref name="Brittanica"/&gt; In 2003 he received a doctorate from the [[University of Wales]], Great Britain.&lt;ref name="SAICBio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saic.edu/profiles/faculty/edward-kac|title=ekac|website=School of the Art Institute of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kac is a professor of art at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref name="SAICBio"/&gt;

== Art career ==
=== 1980s ===
Between 1980 and 1982, Kac belonged to a group that did performance art in the [[Cinelandia]] area of Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref name="LangloisBio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=279|title=Eduardo Kac (biography)|website=www.fondation-langlois.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Osthoff2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Simone Osthoff|title=Performing the Archive: The Transformation of the Archive in Contemporary Art from Repository of Documents to Art Medium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yC4YAQAAMAAJ|year=2009|publisher=Atropos Press|isbn=978-0-9825309-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performances, a response to the extreme conservative political climate of Brazil under military dictatorship, became known as '' Movimento de Arte Pornô'' (''[[Porn Art Movement]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coleccioncisneros.org/editorial/cite-site-sights/documenting-visual|title=DOCUMENTING THE VISUAL: Building a Latin American Collection at the MoMA Library|date=27 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Beginning in 1983, Kac created [[holographic]] poetry works, the first of which was ''HOLO/OLHO'', named after the Portuguese word for "eye". &lt;ref name="Brownie2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Brownie|title=Transforming Type: New Directions in Kinetic Typography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQ2dBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT57|date=18 December 2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-0-85785-566-4|pages=57–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 24 holographic poems followed this first work,&lt;ref name="RyanEmerson2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marie-Laure Ryan|author2=Lori Emerson|author3=Benjamin J.

(1987), a moebius-like work that could be read in two directions.&lt;ref name="Funkhouser2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Thompson Funkhouser|title=Prehistoric Digital Poetry: An Archaeology of Forms, 1959-1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zqFAAAAIAAJ|date=24 June 2007|publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=978-0-8173-1562-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

Around the same time, and drawing on his interest in experimental poetry forms, Kac began making animated poetry works with the French [[Minitel]] videtext terminals that were then in use in Rio.&lt;ref name="Kac2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eduardo Kac|title=Media Poetry: An International Anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8OrAMstlEQC&amp;pg=PA276|year=2007|publisher=Intellect Books|isbn=978-1-84150-030-0|pages=276–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 he contributed one such work, ''Reabracadabra'', to the ''Arte On Line'' exhibition, organized by the Livraria Nobel bookstore in Sao Paolo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://anthology.rhizome.org/reabracadabra|title=NET ART ANTHOLOGY: Reabracadabra|date=27 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rhizome.org/editorial/2016/nov/03/when-net-art-outlives-the-net-eduardo-kacs-poetry-for-videotexto/|title=When Net Art Outlives the Net: Eduardo Kac's Poetry for Videotexto|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://editorial.centroculturadigital.mx/notacorta/reabracadabra-de-eduardo-kac-en-la-net-art-anthology|title=Reabracadabra de Eduardo Kac, en la Net Art Anthology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other videotext animated poems by Kac include ''Recaos'' (1986), ''Tesão'' (1985/86) and ''D/eu/s'' (1986).&lt;ref name="Chandler2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Annmarie Chandler|title=At a Distance: Precursors to Art and Activism on the Internet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ri36wNZoqVkC&amp;pg=PT290|year=2005|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-03328-2|pages=290–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ledesma2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eduardo Ledesma|title=Radical Poetry: Aesthetics, Politics, Technology, and the Ibero-American Avant-Gardes, 1900-2015|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KfVsDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA270|date=2 November 2016|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-6202-8|pages=270–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, with Flavio Ferraz, Kac organized the ''Brasil High-Tech'' exhibition at the Galeria de Arte Centro Empresarial Rio in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/reabracadabry/|title=Media Art Net - Kac, Eduardo: Reabracadabra|first=Media Art|last=Net|date=14 August 2018|website=www.medienkunstnetz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cronologia das artes plásticas no Rio de Janeiro: da missão artística francesa à geração 90 : 1816, mil oitocentos e dezesseis a mil novecentos e noventa e quatro, 1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=deFeAAAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Topbooks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1985 to as late as 1994, Kac did a number of telecommunications performances that used [[Slow-scan television]] (SSTV)  and [[FAX]] technologies to create performances between separate locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1678-53202003000100003&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=pt|title=A arte de comunicação telemática: a interatividade no ciberespaço|first=Walter|last=Zanini|publisher=|journal=ARS (São Paulo)|volume=1|issue=1|pages=11–34|via=SciELO|doi=10.1590/S1678-53202003000100003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leonardo.info/isast/spec.projects/fadon/fadon.html|title=Evanescent Realities|website=www.leonardo.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the late 80s Kac began work on his ''Ornitorrinco'' project, a telepresence artwork made in collaboration with Ed Bennett in Chicago. The work brought together robotics, telecommunications technologies and interactivity to create a robot that was controlled remotely. The piece allowed viewers in one location to control the robot's camera and motion, creating a telepresent work and effecting the experience of viewers in the other location.&lt;ref name="Giannachi2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gabriella Giannachi|title=Virtual Theatres: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0wXWQ5hwtsC&amp;pg=PA82|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-28379-3|pages=82–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kobialka1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michal Kobialka|title=Of Borders and Thresholds: Theatre History, Practice, and Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MSrzO77VBEwC&amp;pg=PA282|year=1999|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-3090-5|pages=282–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Kac moved from Brazil to Chicago, where he would complete his MFA at the Art Institute of Chicago the following year.&lt;ref name="Kostelanetz2013" /&gt;

=== 1990s ===
In the 1990s, Kac continued creating telematic works, with ''Dialogical Drawing'' (1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Art: The Magazine of Contemporary Visual Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UlRUAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=G+B Arts International}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1994) both using networks to explore the viewer experience of an artwork mediated between two site in real time. In the latter case, the artwork joined a plant in New York city and a live canary in Kentucky in conversation.&lt;ref name="Wilson2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Wilson|title=Information Arts: Intersections of Art, Science, and Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sHuXQtYrNPYC&amp;pg=PT145|year=2002|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-73158-4|pages=145–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of a bird as part of its system, making it an early example of what Kac called ''transgenic art''.&lt;ref name="Bolognini2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maurizio Bolognini|title=Machines: Conversations on Art &amp; Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dnE2PjwVFkgC&amp;pg=PA89|year=2012|publisher=postmediabooks|isbn=978-88-7490-074-9|pages=89–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Teleporting An Unknown State'' (1994-96), Kac built a system that allowed a plant to survive in a gallery, illuminated not by sunlight but by the internet viewers of the work. In practice, online viewers of the work triggered a video projection onto the plant of an image representing the sky in the viewer's home location.&lt;ref name="Morey2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sean Morey|title=Rhetorical Delivery and Digital Technologies: Networks, Affect, Electracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uoj4CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT267|date=19 November 2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-40708-9|pages=267–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MachinerySIGGRAPH.1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Association for Computing Machinery|author2=SIGGRAPH.|title=Visual proceedings: the art and interdisciplinary programs of SIGGRAPH 96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=omc-AQAAIAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Association for Computing Machinery|isbn=978-0-89791-784-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Flash Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3tUAAAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=G. Politi}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Notably, Kac coined the term "bioart" with his 1997 performance work ''Time Capsule''.&lt;ref name="Lushetich2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Natasha Lushetich|title=Interdisciplinary Performance: Reformatting Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sdv_CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA242|date=13 April 2016|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|isbn=978-1-137-33503-6|pages=242–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Banash2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Banash|title=Steve Tomasula: The Art and Science of New Media Fiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lj24CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|date=21 May 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-62892-369-8|pages=8–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Time Capsule'', Kac implanted himself with an [[RFID]] chip originally designed for use in pets. A participant in Chicago then triggered the RFID scanned in the Brazilian Gallery where Kac was performing, casing the scanner to display a unique code for the implant. Kac then registered himself on the pet database associated with the implant, becoming the first human to do so.&lt;ref name="Weintraub2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Scott Weintraub|title=Latin American Technopoetics: Scientific Explorations in New Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jOhgDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91|date=17 July 2018|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-429-83939-9|pages=91–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Will Jackson|title=Crisis, Rupture and Anxiety: An Interdisciplinary Examination of Contemporary and Historical Human Challenges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9zQsBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA135|date=1 March 2012|publisher=Cambridge Scholars|isbn=978-1-4438-3616-6|pages=135–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Artbyte|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LVkgAQAAMAAJ|year=2001|publisher=ArtByte, Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the late 90s Kac defined himself either a "transgenic artist" or "bio artist,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/07/bioart/|title=Bioart: The Ethics and Aesthetics of Using Living Tissue as a Medium|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was using [[biotechnology]] and [[genetics]] to create provocative works that concomitantly explore [[scientific technique]]s and critique them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.minnpost.com/arts-arena/2009/04/art-world-today-will-meet-edunia-eduardo-kacs-genetically-engineered-plantimal|title=Art world today will meet 'Edunia,' Eduardo Kac's genetically engineered 'plantimal'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kac's next transgenic artwork, created in 1998/99 and titled "Genesis," involved him taking a quote from the [[Bible]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis 1:26]] - "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth"), transferring it into [[Morse code]], and finally, translating that Morse code (by a conversion principle specially developed by the artist for this work) into the base pairs of genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=278|title=Eduardo Kac : Genesis 2|website=www.fondation-langlois.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bureaud2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Annick Bureaud|title=Eduardo Kac: Telepresence, Biotelematics, Transgenic Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vQjlAAAAMAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Association for Culture and Education, KIBLA Multimedia Center|isbn=978-961-6304-02-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
In one of his best known works, ''[[Alba (rabbit)|Alba]]'', presented in 2000 in Avignon, France, Kac claimed to have commissioned a French laboratory to create a green-fluorescent [[rabbit]]; a rabbit implanted with a [[Green Fluorescent Protein]] (GFP) [[gene]] from a type of [[jellyfish]].&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2001/04/bunny/|title=I Love My Glow Bunny|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HopeRyan2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cat Hope|author2=John Charles Ryan|title=Digital Arts: An Introduction to New Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SO6KAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT171|date=19 June 2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-78093-321-4|pages=171–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under a specific blue light, the rabbit fluoresces green. The work proved to be hugely controversial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=119939&amp;page=1|title=Artist's Glowing, Live Rabbit Creation Causes Fuss|first=A. B.

His work ''Natural History of the Enigma'' (2003-8) continued in the theme of bio art by merging his DNA with that of a [[petunia]], creating a hybrid organism that Kac called a ''plantimal''.&lt;ref name="DunneRaby2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Dunne|author2=Fiona Raby|title=Speculative Everything: Design, Fiction, and Social Dreaming|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9gQyAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54|date=6 December 2013|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-01984-2|pages=54–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-story-of-how-an-artist-created-a-genetic-hybrid-of-himself-and-a-petunia-25148544/|title=The Story of How An Artist Created a Genetic Hybrid of Himself and a Petunia|first=Megan|last=Gambino|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant, also given the name ''Eudinia'' (from Eduardo and Petunia), mimicked the flow of blood through human veins by mixing Kac's DNA only with the plant's genetic components that made the veins in its leaves red.&lt;ref name="DunneRaby2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grau2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oliver Grau|title=Imagery in the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fdHxCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71|date=29 July 2011|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-29742-4|pages=71–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
In 2017 Kac collaborated with the French astronaut [[Thomas Pesquet]] to create an artwork in space called ''Inner Telescope''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/culture/2016/11/17/03004-20161117ARTFIG00228-un-grand-pas-pour-l-art.php|title=Un grand pas pour l'art|date=17 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Kac's instructions, Pesquet cut and folded a piece of paper into a sculptural form that could be read as the three letters forming the French word for ''me'', M-O-I.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/arts/design/eduardo-kac-inner-telescope-space.html|title=A Space Odyssey: Making Art Up There|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2017/04/12/art-space-sparks-discussion-technology-ai|title=Art in Space Sparks Discussion on Technology, AI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6049">'''Ellipsoidal coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] &lt;math&gt;(\lambda, \mu, \nu)&lt;/math&gt; that generalizes the two-dimensional [[elliptic coordinates|elliptic coordinate system]].  Unlike most three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]]s that feature [[quadratic function|quadratic]] [[coordinate surfaces]], the ellipsoidal coordinate system is based on [[Confocal quadrics|confocal quadrics]].

==Basic formulae==

The Cartesian coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt; can be produced from the ellipsoidal coordinates 
&lt;math&gt;( \lambda, \mu, \nu )&lt;/math&gt; by the equations

:&lt;math&gt;
x^{2} = \frac{\left( a^{2} + \lambda \right) \left( a^{2} + \mu \right) \left( a^{2} + \nu \right)}{\left( a^{2} - b^{2}  \right) \left( a^{2} - c^{2} \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y^{2} = \frac{\left( b^{2} + \lambda \right) \left( b^{2} + \mu \right) \left( b^{2} + \nu \right)}{\left( b^{2} - a^{2}  \right) \left( b^{2} - c^{2} \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z^{2} = \frac{\left( c^{2} + \lambda \right) \left( c^{2} + \mu \right) \left( c^{2} + \nu \right)}{\left( c^{2} - b^{2}  \right) \left( c^{2} - a^{2} \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the following limits apply to the coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;
- \lambda &lt; c^{2} &lt; - \mu &lt; b^{2} &lt; -\nu &lt; a^{2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; are [[ellipsoid]]s

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2} + \lambda} +  \frac{y^{2}}{b^{2} + \lambda} + \frac{z^{2}}{c^{2} + \lambda} = 1,
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; are [[hyperboloid]]s of one sheet

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2} + \mu} +  \frac{y^{2}}{b^{2} + \mu} + \frac{z^{2}}{c^{2} + \mu} = 1,
&lt;/math&gt;

because the last term in the lhs is negative, and surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; are [[hyperboloid]]s of two sheets
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2} + \nu} +  \frac{y^{2}}{b^{2} + \nu} + \frac{z^{2}}{c^{2} + \nu} = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

because the last two terms in the lhs are negative.

The orthogonal system of quadrics used for the ellipsoidal coordinates are [[Confocal quadrics|confocal quadrics]].

==Scale factors and differential operators==

For brevity in the equations below, we introduce a function

:&lt;math&gt;
S(\sigma) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \left( a^{2} + \sigma \right) \left( b^{2} + \sigma \right) \left( c^{2} + \sigma \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; can represent any of the three variables &lt;math&gt;(\lambda, \mu, \nu )&lt;/math&gt;.  
Using this function, the scale factors can be written
 
:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\lambda} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\left( \lambda - \mu \right) \left( \lambda - \nu\right)}{S(\lambda)}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\mu} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\left( \mu - \lambda\right) \left( \mu - \nu\right)}{S(\mu)}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\nu} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\left( \nu - \lambda\right) \left( \nu - \mu\right)}{S(\nu)}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the infinitesimal volume element equals

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = \frac{\left( \lambda - \mu \right) \left( \lambda - \nu \right) \left( \mu - \nu\right)}{8\sqrt{-S(\lambda) S(\mu) S(\nu)}} \  d\lambda d\mu d\nu
&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[Laplacian]] is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^{2} \Phi = 
\frac{4\sqrt{S(\lambda)}}{\left( \lambda - \mu \right) \left( \lambda - \nu\right)}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda} \left[ \sqrt{S(\lambda)} \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \lambda} \right] \  +  &lt;/math&gt;
:::::&lt;math&gt; 
\frac{4\sqrt{S(\mu)}}{\left( \mu - \lambda \right) \left( \mu - \nu\right)}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} \left[ \sqrt{S(\mu)} \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \mu} \right] \  + \  
\frac{4\sqrt{S(\nu)}}{\left( \nu - \lambda \right) \left( \nu - \mu\right)}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \nu} \left[ \sqrt{S(\nu)} \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \nu} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; 
and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\lambda, \mu, \nu)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting 
the scale factors into the general formulae 
found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3944">In [[scientific research]], an '''experimental system'''  is the physical, technical and procedural basis for an [[experiment]] or series of experiments.  Historian of science [[Hans-Jörg Rheinberger]] defines an experimental system as: "A basic unit of experimental activity combining local, technical, instrumental, institutional, social, and [[Epistemology|epistemic]] aspects."&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberger, ''Toward a History of Epistemic Things'', p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Scientists]] (particularly laboratory biologists) and [[historians]] and [[philosophers]] of [[biology]] have pointed to the development and spread of successful experimental systems, such as those based on popular [[model organism]] or scientific apparatus, as key elements in the history of science, particularly since the early 20th century.  The choice of an appropriate experimental system is often seen as critical for a scientist's long-term success, as experimental systems can be very productive for some kinds of questions and less productive for others, acquiring a sort of momentum that takes research in unpredicted directions.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberger, ''Toward a History of Epistemic Things'', pp. 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful experimental system must be stable and reproducible enough for scientists to make sense of the system's behavior, but variable and unpredictable enough that it can produce useful results.  In many cases, a well-understood experimental system can be "[[black-boxed]]" as a standard technique, which can then be a component of other experimental systems.  Rheinberger divides experimental systems into two parts: the part under investigation ("epistemic things") and the well-understood part that provides a stable context for experimentation ("technical objects").&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberger, ''Toward a History of Epistemic Things'', pp. 24-31. Note that the translation from German language introduces an ambiguity, or a possible misunderstanding. The meaning of ''Experimentalsystem'', referring to a system that is the site for experiments, whereas an ''experimentelles System'' is a system that is unfinished and under experimental investigation. Rheinberger uses the former term.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of experimental systems in biology often requires the "[[domestication]]" of a particular organism for the laboratory environment, including the creation of relatively homogeneous lines or [[Strain (biology)|strains]] and the tailoring of conditions to highlight the variable aspects that scientists are interested in.&lt;ref&gt;See Kohler, ''Lords of the Fly''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientific technologies, similarly, often require the development of a full experimental system to go from a viable concept to a technique that works in practice on a usefully consistent basis.  For example, the invention of the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) is generally attributed to [[Kary Mullis]], who came up with the concept in 1983, but the process of development of PCR into the revolutionary technology it became by the early 1990s took years of work by others at [[Cetus Corporation]]&amp;mdash;and the basic components of the system had been known since the 1960s DNA synthesis work of [[Har Gobind Khorana]]&amp;mdash;making "who invented PCR?" a complicated question.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinow, ''Making PCR'', pp. 7-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''exterior product''' or '''wedge product''' of vectors is an algebraic construction used in [[geometry]] to study [[area]]s, [[volume]]s, and their higher-dimensional analogues. The exterior product of two vectors ''u'' and&amp;nbsp;''v'', denoted by {{nowrap|''u'' ∧ ''v''}}, is called a [[bivector]] and lives in a space called the ''exterior square'', a [[vector space]] that is distinct from the original space of vectors.  The [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]]&lt;ref&gt;Strictly speaking, the magnitude depends on some additional structure, namely that the vectors be in a [[Euclidean space]].  We do not generally assume that this structure is available, except where it is helpful to develop intuition on the subject.&lt;/ref&gt; of {{nowrap|''u'' ∧ ''v''}} can be interpreted as the area of the parallelogram with sides ''u'' and&amp;nbsp;''v'', which in three dimensions can also be computed using the [[cross product]] of the two vectors. Like the cross product, the exterior product is [[anticommutativity|anticommutative]], meaning that {{nowrap|1=''u'' ∧ ''v'' = −(''v'' ∧ ''u'')}} for all vectors ''u'' and ''v'', but, unlike the cross product, the exterior product is [[associative]].  One way to visualize a bivector is as a family of [[parallelograms]] all lying in the same plane, having the same area, and with the same [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]]&amp;mdash;a choice of clockwise or counterclockwise.

When regarded in this manner, the exterior product of two vectors is called a [[blade (geometry)|2-blade]].  More generally, the exterior product of any number ''k'' of vectors can be defined and is sometimes called a ''k''-blade.  It lives in a space known as the ''k''th exterior power.  The magnitude of the resulting ''k''-blade is the volume of the ''k''-dimensional [[Parallelepiped#Parallelotope|parallelotope]] whose edges are the given vectors, just as the magnitude of the [[scalar triple product]] of vectors in three dimensions gives the volume of the parallelepiped generated by those vectors.

The '''exterior algebra''', or '''Grassmann algebra''' after [[Hermann Grassmann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Grassmann|1844}} introduced these as ''extended'' algebras (cf. {{harvnb|Clifford|1878}}). He used the word ''äußere'' (literally translated as ''outer'', or ''exterior'') only to indicate the ''produkt'' he defined, which is nowadays conventionally called ''exterior product'', probably to distinguish it from the ''[[outer product]]'' as defined in modern [[linear algebra]].&lt;/ref&gt; is the algebraic system whose product is the exterior product.  The exterior algebra provides an algebraic setting in which to answer geometric questions.  For instance, blades have a concrete geometric interpretation, and objects in the exterior algebra can be manipulated according to a set of unambiguous rules. The exterior algebra contains objects that are not only ''k''-blades, but sums of ''k''-blades; such a sum is called a [[Multivector|''k''-vector]].&lt;ref&gt;The term ''k-vector'' is not equivalent to and should not be confused with similar terms such as ''[[4-vector]]'', which in a different context could mean a 4-dimensional vector. A minority of authors use the term ''k''-multivector instead of ''k''-vector, which avoids this confusion.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''k''-blades, because they are simple products of vectors, are called the simple elements of the algebra.  The ''rank'' of any ''k''-vector is defined to be the smallest number of simple elements of which it is a sum.  The exterior product extends to the full exterior algebra, so that it makes sense to multiply any two elements of the algebra.  Equipped with this product, the exterior algebra is an [[associative algebra]], which means that {{nowrap|1=''α'' ∧ (''β'' ∧ ''γ'') = (''α'' ∧ ''β'') ∧ ''γ''}} for any elements ''α'', ''β'', ''γ''.  The ''k''-vectors have degree ''k'', meaning that they are sums of products of ''k'' vectors.  When elements of different degrees are multiplied, the degrees add like multiplication of polynomials.  This means that the exterior algebra is a [[graded algebra]].

The definition of the exterior algebra makes sense for spaces not just of geometric vectors, but of other vector-like objects such as [[vector field]]s or [[function (mathematics)|functions]].  In full generality, the exterior algebra can be defined for [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over a [[commutative ring]], and for other structures of interest in [[abstract algebra]].  It is one of these more general constructions where the exterior algebra finds one of its most important applications, where it appears as the algebra of [[differential forms]] that is fundamental in areas that use [[differential geometry]].  Differential forms are mathematical objects that represent [[infinitesimal]] areas of infinitesimal parallelograms (and higher-dimensional bodies), and so can be [[integral|integrated]] over surfaces and higher dimensional [[manifold]]s in a way that generalizes the [[line integral]]s from calculus.  The exterior algebra also has many algebraic properties that make it a convenient tool in algebra itself.  The association of the exterior algebra to a vector space is a type of [[functor]] on vector spaces, which means that it is compatible in a certain way with linear transformations of vector spaces. The exterior algebra is one example of a [[bialgebra]], meaning that its [[dual space]] also possesses a product, and this dual product is compatible with the exterior product. This dual algebra is precisely the algebra of [[alternating multilinear form]]s,  and the pairing between the exterior algebra and its dual is given by the [[interior product]].

==Motivating examples==
&lt;!--The purpose of this section is to motivate the skewness of the exterior product on vectors in ''V''--&gt;

===Areas in the plane===
[[Image:Area parallellogram as determinant.svg|thumb|right|The area of a parallelogram in terms of the determinant of the matrix of coordinates of two of its vertices.]]

The [[Cartesian plane]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a vector space equipped with a [[basis of a vector space|basis]] consisting of a pair of [[unit vector]]s

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf e}_1 = \begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix},\quad {\mathbf e}_2 = \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose that

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf v} = \begin{bmatrix}a\\b\end{bmatrix} = a {\mathbf e}_1 + b {\mathbf e}_2, \quad {\mathbf w} = \begin{bmatrix}c\\d\end{bmatrix} = c {\mathbf e}_1 + d {\mathbf e}_2&lt;/math&gt;

are a pair of given vectors in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, written in components. There is a unique parallelogram having '''v''' and '''w''' as two of its sides. The ''area'' of this parallelogram is given by the standard [[determinant]] formula:

:&lt;math&gt; \text{Area} = \left| \det \begin{bmatrix} {\mathbf v} &amp; {\mathbf w} \end{bmatrix} \right| = \left| \det \begin{bmatrix} a &amp; c \\ b &amp; d \end{bmatrix} \right| = \left| ad - bc \right| .&lt;/math&gt;

Consider now the exterior product of '''v''' and '''w''':

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
{\mathbf v}\wedge {\mathbf w} &amp; = (a{\mathbf e}_1 + b{\mathbf e}_2) \wedge (c{\mathbf e}_1 + d{\mathbf e}_2) \\
&amp; = ac{\mathbf e}_1 \wedge {\mathbf e}_1+ ad{\mathbf e}_1 \wedge {\mathbf e}_2+bc{\mathbf e}_2 \wedge {\mathbf e}_1+bd{\mathbf e}_2 \wedge {\mathbf e}_2 \\
&amp; = \left ( ad - bc \right ){\mathbf e}_1 \wedge {\mathbf e}_2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the first step uses the distributive law for the [[#Formal_definitions_and_algebraic_properties|exterior product]], and the last uses the fact that the exterior product is alternating, and in particular {{nowrap|1='''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = −('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. (Note that the fact that the exterior product is alternating also forces &lt;math&gt; \mathbf e_1 \wedge \mathbf e_1 = \mathbf e_2 \wedge \mathbf e_2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.) Note that the coefficient in this last expression is precisely the determinant of the matrix {{nowrap|1=['''v''' '''w''']}}. The fact that this may be positive or negative has the intuitive meaning that '''v''' and '''w''' may be oriented in a counterclockwise or clockwise sense as the vertices of the parallelogram they define. Such an area is called the ''signed area'' of the parallelogram: the absolute value of the signed area is the ordinary area, and the sign determines its orientation.

The fact that this coefficient is the signed area is not an accident. In fact, it is relatively easy to see that the exterior product should be related to the signed area if one tries to axiomatize this area as an algebraic construct. In detail, if {{nowrap|1=A('''v''', '''w''')}} denotes the signed area of the parallelogram of which the pair of vectors '''v''' and '''w''' form two adjacent sides, then A must satisfy the following properties:
# {{nowrap|1=A(''j'''''v''', ''k'''''w''') = ''jk''A('''v''', '''w''')}} for any real numbers ''j'' and ''k'', since rescaling either of the sides rescales the area by the same amount (and reversing the direction of one of the sides reverses the orientation of the parallelogram).
# {{nowrap|1=A('''v''', '''v''') = 0}}, since the area of the [[degenerate (mathematics)|degenerate]] parallelogram determined by '''v''' (i.e., a [[line segment]]) is zero.
# {{nowrap|1=A('''w''', '''v''') = −A('''v''', '''w''')}}, since interchanging the roles of '''v''' and '''w''' reverses the orientation of the parallelogram.
# {{nowrap|1=A('''v''' + ''j'''''w''', '''w''') = A('''v''', '''w''')}}, for real ''j'', since adding a multiple of '''w''' to '''v''' affects neither the base nor the height of the parallelogram and consequently preserves its area.
# {{nowrap|1=A('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1}}, since the area of the unit square is one.
With the exception of the last property, the exterior product of two vectors satisfies the same properties as the area. In a certain sense, the exterior product generalizes the final property by allowing the area of a parallelogram to be compared to that of any "standard" chosen parallelogram in a parallel plane (here, the one with sides '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In other words, the exterior product provides a ''basis-independent'' formulation of area.&lt;ref&gt;This axiomatization of areas is due to [[Leopold Kronecker]] and [[Karl Weierstrass]]; see {{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1989|loc=Historical Note}}. For a modern treatment, see {{harvtxt|Mac Lane|Birkhoff|1999|loc=Theorem IX.2.2}}. For an elementary treatment, see {{harvtxt|Strang|1993|loc=Chapter 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross and triple products===
[[Image:Exterior calc cross product.svg|250px|thumb|The cross product ('''&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;''' vector) in relation to the exterior product ('''&lt;span style="color:#779ECB;"&gt;light blue&lt;/span&gt;''' parallelogram). The length of the cross product is to the length of the parallel unit vector ('''&lt;span style="color:#CC0000;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;''') as the size of the exterior product is to the size of the reference parallelogram ('''&lt;span style="color:#CC4E5C;"&gt;light red&lt;/span&gt;''').]]

For vectors in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the exterior algebra is closely related to the [[cross product]] and [[triple product]]. Using the standard basis {{nowrap|{'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;},}} the exterior product of a pair of vectors

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} = u_1 \mathbf{e}_1 + u_2 \mathbf{e}_2 + u_3 \mathbf{e}_3 &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = v_1 \mathbf{e}_1 + v_2 \mathbf{e}_2 + v_3 \mathbf{e}_3 &lt;/math&gt;

is

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v} = (u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1) (\mathbf{e}_1 \wedge \mathbf{e}_2) + (u_3 v_1 - u_1 v_3) (\mathbf{e}_3 \wedge \mathbf{e}_1) + (u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2) (\mathbf{e}_2 \wedge \mathbf{e}_3) &lt;/math&gt;

where {'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;} is the basis for the three-dimensional space Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). The coefficients above are the same as those in the usual definition of the [[cross product]] of vectors in three dimensions, the only difference being that the exterior product is not an ordinary vector, but instead is a 2-vector.

Bringing in a third vector

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{w} = w_1 \mathbf{e}_1 + w_2 \mathbf{e}_2 + w_3 \mathbf{e}_3, &lt;/math&gt;

the exterior product of three vectors is

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v} \wedge \mathbf{w} = (u_1 v_2 w_3 + u_2 v_3 w_1 + u_3 v_1 w_2 - u_1 v_3 w_2 - u_2 v_1 w_3 - u_3 v_2 w_1) (\mathbf{e}_1 \wedge \mathbf{e}_2 \wedge \mathbf{e}_3) &lt;/math&gt;

where {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the basis vector for the one-dimensional space Λ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). The scalar coefficient is the [[triple product]] of the three vectors.

The cross product and triple product in three dimensions each admit both geometric and algebraic interpretations. The cross product {{nowrap|'''u''' × '''v'''}} can be interpreted as a vector which is perpendicular to both '''u''' and '''v''' and whose magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram determined by the two vectors. It can also be interpreted as the vector consisting of the [[minor (mathematics)|minors]] of the matrix with columns '''u''' and '''v'''. The triple product of '''u''', '''v''', and&amp;nbsp;'''w''' is geometrically a (signed) volume. Algebraically, it is the determinant of the matrix with columns '''u''', '''v''', and&amp;nbsp;'''w'''. The exterior product in three dimensions allows for similar interpretations: it, too, can be identified with oriented areas or volumes spanned by the two or three vectors involved. In fact, in the presence of a positively oriented [[orthonormal basis]], the exterior product generalizes these geometric notions to higher dimensions.

==Formal definitions and algebraic properties==
The exterior algebra {{math|Λ(''V'')}} of a vector space {{math|''V''}} over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''K''}} is defined as the [[Quotient ring|quotient algebra]] of the [[tensor algebra]] {{math|''T''(''V'')}} by the two-sided [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] {{math|''I''}} generated by all elements of the form {{math|1=''x'' ⊗ ''x''}} for {{math|1=''x'' ∈ ''V''}} (i.e. all tensors that can be expressed as the tensor product of a vector in {{math|''V''}} by itself).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mac Lane|Birkhoff|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolically,

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(V) = T(V)/I .&lt;/math&gt;

The exterior product {{math|∧}} of two elements of {{math|Λ(''V'')}} is the product induced by the tensor product {{math|⊗}} of {{math|''T''(''V'')}}. That is, if
:&lt;math&gt;\pi:T(V)\to \Lambda(V) = T(V)/I&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[canonical projection map|canonical surjection]], and {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are in {{math|Λ(''V'')}}, then there are &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; in {{math|''T''(''V'')}} such that &lt;math&gt;a=\pi(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=\pi(\beta),&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;a\wedge b = \pi(\alpha\otimes\beta).&lt;/math&gt;
It results from the definition of a quotient algebra that the value of &lt;math&gt;a\wedge b&lt;/math&gt; does not depend of a particular choice of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta.&lt;/math&gt;

As {{math|1=''T''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''K''}}, {{math|1=''T''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''V''}}, and &lt;math&gt;\left(T^0(V)\oplus T^1(V)\right)\cap I= \{ 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;, the inclusions of {{math|''K''}} and {{math|''V''}} in {{math|''T''(''V'')}} induce injections of {{math|''K''}} and {{math|''V''}} into {{math|Λ(''V'')}}. These injections are commonly considered as inclusions, and called ''natural embeddings'', ''natural injections'' or ''natural inclusions''. The word ''canonical'' is also commonly used in place of ''natural''.

===Alternating product===
The exterior product is by construction [[Alternating algebra|''alternating'']] on elements of ''V'', which means that {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∧ ''x'' = 0}} for all {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''V''}}, by the above construction.  It follows that the product is also [[anticommutative]] on elements of ''V'', for supposing that {{nowrap|''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''V''}},

:&lt;math&gt;0 = (x+y)\wedge (x+y) = x\wedge x + x\wedge y + y\wedge x + y\wedge y = x\wedge y + y\wedge x&lt;/math&gt;

hence

:&lt;math&gt; x \wedge y = - ( y \wedge x ) .&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, if ''σ'' is a [[permutation group|permutation]] of the integers {{nowrap|[1, ..., ''k'']}}, and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are elements of ''V'', it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;x_{\sigma(1)}\wedge x_{\sigma(2)}\wedge\cdots\wedge x_{\sigma(k)} = \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)x_1\wedge x_2\wedge\cdots \wedge x_k,&lt;/math&gt;

where sgn(''σ'') is the [[signature of a permutation|signature of the permutation]] ''σ''.&lt;ref&gt;A proof of this can be found in more generality in {{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; for some {{nowrap|''i'' ≠ ''j''}}, then the following generalization of the alternating property also holds:
:&lt;math&gt;x_{1}\wedge x_{2}\wedge\cdots\wedge x_{k} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Exterior power===

The ''k''th '''exterior power''' of ''V'', denoted Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V''), is the [[vector subspace]] of Λ(''V'') [[linear span|spanned]] by elements of the form
:&lt;math&gt;x_1\wedge x_2\wedge\cdots\wedge x_k,\quad x_i\in V, i=1,2,\ldots, k.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{nowrap|''α'' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}}, then ''α'' is said to be a '''[[p-vector|''k''-vector]]'''. If, furthermore, ''α'' can be expressed as an exterior product of ''k'' elements of ''V'', then ''α'' is said to be '''decomposable'''. Although decomposable ''k''-vectors span Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V''), not every element of Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') is decomposable. For example, in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, the following 2-vector is not decomposable:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = e_1\wedge e_2 + e_3\wedge e_4.&lt;/math&gt;
(This is a [[symplectic form]], since {{nowrap|''α'' ∧ ''α'' ≠ 0}}.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Sternberg|1964|loc=§III.6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;)

====Basis and dimension====

If the [[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]] of ''V'' is ''n'' and {{nowrap|{''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}{{void}}}} is a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of ''V'', then the set
:&lt;math&gt;\{e_{i_1}\wedge e_{i_2}\wedge\cdots\wedge e_{i_k} \mid 1\le i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k \le n\}&lt;/math&gt;
is a basis for Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V''). The reason is the following: given any exterior product of the form
:&lt;math&gt;v_1\wedge\cdots\wedge v_k ,&lt;/math&gt;
every vector ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; can be written as a [[linear combination]] of the basis vectors ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;; using the bilinearity of the exterior product, this can be expanded to a linear combination of exterior products of those basis vectors. Any exterior product in which the same basis vector appears more than once is zero; any exterior product in which the basis vectors do not appear in the proper order can be reordered, changing the sign whenever two basis vectors change places. In general, the resulting coefficients of the basis ''k''-vectors can be computed as the [[minor (linear algebra)|minor]]s of the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] that describes the vectors ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of the basis ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

By counting the basis elements, the dimension of Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') is equal to a [[binomial coefficient]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\dim \Lambda^k(V) = \binom{n}{k} .&lt;/math&gt;
In particular, {{nowrap|1=Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') = {0}{{void}}}} for {{nowrap|''k'' &gt; ''n''}}.

Any element of the exterior algebra can be written as a sum of [[p-vector|''k''-vector]]s. Hence, as a vector space the exterior algebra is a [[Direct sum of modules|direct sum]]
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(V) = \Lambda^0(V)\oplus \Lambda^1(V) \oplus \Lambda^2(V) \oplus \cdots \oplus \Lambda^n(V)&lt;/math&gt;
(where by convention {{nowrap|1=Λ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') = ''K''}} and {{nowrap|1=Λ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') = ''V''}}), and therefore its dimension is equal to the sum of the binomial coefficients, which is 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

====Rank of a ''k''-vector====

If {{nowrap|''α'' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}}, then it is possible to express ''α'' as a linear combination of decomposable [[p-vector|''k''-vector]]s:

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = \alpha^{(1)} + \alpha^{(2)} + \cdots + \alpha^{(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

where each ''α''&lt;sup&gt;(''i'')&lt;/sup&gt; is decomposable, say

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^{(i)} = \alpha^{(i)}_1\wedge\cdots\wedge\alpha^{(i)}_k,\quad i=1,2,\ldots, s.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''rank''' of the ''k''-vector ''α'' is the minimal number of decomposable ''k''-vectors in such an expansion of ''α''. This is similar to the notion of [[tensor rank]].

Rank is particularly important in the study of 2-vectors {{harv|Sternberg|1974|loc=§III.6}} {{harv|Bryant|Chern|Gardner|Goldschmidt|1991}}. The rank of a 2-vector ''α'' can be identified with half the [[rank of a matrix|rank of the matrix]] of coefficients of ''α'' in a basis. Thus if ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a basis for ''V'', then ''α'' can be expressed uniquely as

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \sum_{i,j}a_{ij}e_i\wedge e_j&lt;/math&gt;

where {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = −''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (the matrix of coefficients is [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]]). The rank of the matrix ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; is therefore even, and is twice the rank of the form ''α''.

In characteristic 0, the 2-vector ''α'' has rank ''p'' if and only if

:&lt;math&gt;\underset{p}{\underbrace{\alpha\wedge\cdots\wedge\alpha}}\not= 0&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\underset{p+1}{\underbrace{\alpha\wedge\cdots\wedge\alpha}} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Graded structure===
The exterior product of a ''k''-vector with a ''p''-vector is a {{nowrap|(''k'' + ''p'')}}-vector, once again invoking bilinearity. As a consequence, the direct sum decomposition of the preceding section

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(V) = \Lambda^0(V)\oplus \Lambda^1(V) \oplus \Lambda^2(V) \oplus \cdots \oplus \Lambda^n(V)&lt;/math&gt;

gives the exterior algebra the additional structure of a [[graded algebra]], that is

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^k(V)\wedge\Lambda^p(V)\sub \Lambda^{k+p}(V).&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, if {{math|''K''}} is the basis field, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^0(V)=K&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^1(V)=V.&lt;/math&gt;

The exterior product is graded anticommutative, meaning that if {{nowrap|''α'' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}} and {{nowrap|''β'' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}}, then

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha\wedge\beta = (-1)^{kp}\beta\wedge\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

In addition to studying the graded structure on the exterior algebra, {{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1989}} studies additional graded structures on exterior algebras, such as those on the exterior algebra of a [[graded module]] (a module that already carries its own gradation).

===Universal property===
Let {{math|''V''}} be a vector space over the field {{math|''K''}}. Informally, multiplication in {{math|Λ(''V'')}} is performed by manipulating symbols and imposing a [[distributive law]], an [[associative law]], and using the identity {{math|1=''v'' ∧ ''v'' = 0}} for {{math|''v'' ∈ ''V''}}. Formally, {{math|Λ(''V'')}} is the "most general" algebra in which these rules hold for the multiplication, in the sense that any unital associative {{math|''K''}}-algebra containing {{math|''V''}} with alternating multiplication on {{math|''V''}} must contain a homomorphic image of {{math|Λ(''V'')}}. In other words, the exterior algebra has the following [[universal property]]:&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1989|loc=§III.7.1}}, and {{harvtxt|Mac Lane|Birkhoff|1999|loc=Theorem XVI.6.8}}. More detail on universal properties in general can be found in {{harvtxt|Mac Lane|Birkhoff|1999|loc=Chapter VI}}, and throughout the works of Bourbaki.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 2em"&gt;
Given any unital associative {{math|''K''}}-algebra {{math|''A''}} and any {{math|''K''}}-[[linear map]] {{math|1=''j'' : ''V'' → ''A''}} such that {{math|1=''j''(''v'')''j''(''v'') = 0}} for every {{math|''v''}} in {{math|''V''}}, then there exists ''precisely one'' unital [[algebra homomorphism]] {{math|1=''f'' : Λ(''V'') → ''A''}} such that {{math|1=''j''(''v'') = ''f''(''i''(''v''))}} for all {{math|''v''}} in {{math|''V''}} (here {{math|''i''}} is the natural inclusion of {{math|''V''}} in {{math|Λ(''V'')}}, see above).
&lt;/div&gt;

[[Image:ExteriorAlgebra-01.png|center|Universal property of the exterior algebra]]

To construct the most general algebra that contains {{math|''V''}} and whose multiplication is alternating on {{math|''V''}}, it is natural to start with the most general associative algebra that contains {{math|''V''}}, the [[tensor algebra]] {{math|''T''(''V'')}}, and then enforce the alternating property by taking a suitable [[quotient ring|quotient]]. We thus take the two-sided [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] {{math|''I''}} in {{math|''T''(''V'')}} generated by all elements of the form {{math|''v'' ⊗ ''v''}} for {{math|''v''}} in {{math|''V''}}, and define {{math|Λ(''V'')}} as the quotient

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(V) = T(V)/I\ &lt;/math&gt;

(and use {{math|∧}} as the symbol for multiplication in {{math|Λ(''V''))}}. It is then straightforward to show that {{math|Λ(''V'')}} contains {{math|''V''}} and satisfies the above universal property.

As a consequence of this construction, the operation of assigning to a vector space {{math|''V''}} its exterior algebra {{math|Λ(''V'')}} is a [[functor]] from the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of vector spaces to the category of algebras.

Rather than defining {{math|Λ(''V'')}} first and then identifying the exterior powers {{math|Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}} as certain subspaces, one may alternatively define the spaces {{math|Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}} first and then combine them to form the algebra {{math|Λ(''V'')}}. This approach is often used in differential geometry and is described in the next section.

===Generalizations===

Given a [[commutative ring]] ''R'' and an ''R''-[[module (mathematics)|module]] ''M'', we can define the exterior algebra Λ(''M'') just as above, as a suitable quotient of the tensor algebra '''T'''(''M''). It will satisfy the analogous universal property. Many of the properties of Λ(''M'') also require that ''M'' be a [[projective module]]. Where finite dimensionality is used, the properties further require that ''M'' be [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] and projective. Generalizations to the most common situations can be found in {{harv|Bourbaki|1989}}.

Exterior algebras of [[vector bundle]]s are frequently considered in geometry and topology. There are no essential differences between the algebraic properties of the exterior algebra of finite-dimensional vector bundles and those of the exterior algebra of finitely generated projective modules, by the [[Serre–Swan theorem]]. More general exterior algebras can be defined for [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] of modules.

==Duality==

===Alternating operators===

Given two vector spaces ''V'' and ''X'', an '''alternating operator''' from ''V''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; to ''X'' is a [[multilinear map]]

:&lt;math&gt; f: V^k \to X &lt;/math&gt;

such that whenever ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[linearly dependent]] vectors in ''V'', then

:&lt;math&gt; f(v_1,\ldots, v_k)=0&lt;/math&gt;

The map

:&lt;math&gt; w: V^k \to \Lambda^k(V) &lt;/math&gt;

which associates to ''k'' vectors from ''V'' their exterior product, i.e. their corresponding ''k''-vector, is also alternating. In fact, this map is the "most general" alternating operator defined on ''V''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;: given any other alternating operator {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; → ''X''}}, there exists a unique [[linear map]] {{nowrap|''φ'' : Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') → ''X''}} with {{nowrap|1=''f'' = ''φ'' ∘ ''w''}}. This [[universal property]] characterizes the space Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') and can serve as its definition.

=== Alternating multilinear forms ===
&lt;!-- Alternating form redirects here --&gt;

[[File:N-form.svg|thumb|125px|Geometric interpretation for the '''exterior product''' of ''n'' [[1-form]]s ('''ε''', '''η''', '''ω''') to obtain an ''n''-form ("mesh" of [[coordinate surface]]s, here planes),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=R. Penrose| title=[[The Road to Reality]]| publisher= Vintage books| year=2007 | isbn=0-679-77631-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1, 2, 3}}. The "circulations" show [[Orientation (vector space)|orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gravitation|author1=J.A. Wheeler |author2=C. Misner |author3=K.S. Thorne |publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co|year=1973|pages=58–60, 83, 100–109, 115–119|isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The above discussion specializes to the case when {{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''K''}}, the base field. In this case an alternating multilinear function
:&lt;math&gt;f : V^k \to K\ &lt;/math&gt;
is called an '''alternating multilinear form'''. The set of all [[Alternating map|alternating]] [[Multilinear form|multilinear forms]] is a vector space, as the sum of two such maps, or the product of such a map with a scalar, is again alternating. By the universal property of the exterior power, the space of alternating forms of degree ''k'' on ''V'' is [[natural transformation|naturally]] isomorphic with the [[dual vector space]] (Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''V'')&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.  If ''V'' is finite-dimensional, then the latter is naturally isomorphic to  Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;). In particular, the dimension of the space of alternating maps from ''V''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; to ''K'' is [[binomial coefficient|''n'' choose ''k'']].

Under this identification, the exterior product takes a concrete form: it produces a new anti-symmetric map from two given ones. Suppose {{nowrap|''ω'' : ''V''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; → ''K''}} and {{nowrap|''η'' : ''V''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; → ''K''}} are two anti-symmetric maps. As in the case of [[tensor product]]s of multilinear maps, the number of variables of their exterior product is the sum of the numbers of their variables. It is defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Some conventions, particularly in physics, define the exterior product as

:&lt;math&gt;\omega\wedge\eta=\operatorname{Alt}(\omega\otimes\eta).&lt;/math&gt;

This convention is not adopted here, but is discussed in connection with [[Exterior algebra#Alternating tensor algebra|alternating tensors]].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\omega\wedge\eta=\frac{(k+m)!}{k!\,m!}\operatorname{Alt}(\omega\otimes\eta),&lt;/math&gt;

where the alternation Alt of a multilinear map is defined to be the average of the sign-adjusted values over all the [[permutation]]s of its variables:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Alt}(\omega)(x_1,\ldots,x_k)=\frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in S_k}\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)\,\omega(x_{\sigma(1)},\ldots,x_{\sigma(k)}).&lt;/math&gt;

This definition of the exterior product is well-defined even if the [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' has [[characteristic of a field|finite characteristic]], if one considers an equivalent version of the above that does not use factorials or any constants:

:&lt;math&gt;{\omega \wedge \eta(x_1,\ldots,x_{k+m})} = \sum_{\sigma \in Sh_{k,m}} \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)\,\omega(x_{\sigma(1)}, \ldots, x_{\sigma(k)}) \eta(x_{\sigma(k+1)}, \ldots, x_{\sigma(k+m)}),&lt;/math&gt;

where here {{nowrap|Sh&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊂ ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the subset of [[(p,q) shuffle|(''k'',''m'') shuffles]]: [[permutation]]s ''σ'' of the set {{nowrap|{1, 2, ..., ''k'' + ''m''}{{void}}}} such that {{nowrap|''σ''(1) &lt; ''σ''(2) &lt; ... &lt; ''σ''(''k'')}}, and {{nowrap|''σ''(''k'' + 1) &lt; ''σ''(''k'' + 2) &lt; ... &lt; ''σ''(''k'' + ''m'')}}.

===Bialgebra structure===
There is a correspondence between the graded dual of the graded algebra Λ(''V'') and alternating multilinear forms on ''V''. The exterior algebra (as well as the [[symmetric algebra]]) inherits a bialgebra structure, and, indeed, a [[Hopf algebra]] structure, from the [[tensor algebra]]. See the article on [[tensor algebra]]s for a detailed treatment of the topic.

The exterior product of multilinear forms defined above is dual to a [[coproduct]] defined on Λ(''V''), giving the structure of a [[coalgebra]]. The '''coproduct''' is a linear function {{nowrap|Δ : Λ(''V'') → Λ(''V'') ⊗ Λ(''V'')}} which is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(v) = 1 \otimes v + v \otimes 1&lt;/math&gt;

on elements ''v''∈''V''. The symbol 1 stands for the unit element of the field ''K''. Recall that {{nowrap|''K'' ⊂ Λ(''V''),}} so that the above really does lie in {{nowrap|Λ(''V'') ⊗ Λ(''V'').}} This definition of the coproduct is extended to the full space Λ(''V'') by (linear) homomorphism. That is, for ''v'',''w''∈''V'', one has, by definition, the homomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(v\wedge w)= \Delta(v) \wedge \Delta(w)&lt;/math&gt;

The correct form of this homomorphism is not what one might naively write, but has to be the one carefully defined in the [[coalgebra]] article.  In this case, one obtains
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta(v \wedge w) = 1 \otimes (v \wedge w) + v \otimes w - w \otimes v + (v \wedge w) \otimes 1.
&lt;/math&gt;

Extending to the full space Λ(''V''), one has, in general,
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(x_1\wedge\cdots\wedge x_k) = \Delta(x_1) \wedge\cdots \wedge \Delta(x_k)&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding this out in detail, one obtains the following expression on decomposable elements:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(x_1\wedge\cdots\wedge x_k) = \sum_{p=0}^k \; \sum_{\sigma\in Sh(p+1,k-p)} \; \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma) (x_{\sigma(0)}\wedge\cdots\wedge x_{\sigma(p)})\otimes (x_{\sigma(p+1)}\wedge\cdots\wedge x_{\sigma(k)}).&lt;/math&gt;

where the second summation is taken over all [[(p,q) shuffle|{{nowrap|(''p''+1, ''k''−''p'')}}-shuffles]].  The above is written with a notational trick, to keep track of the field element 1: the trick is to write &lt;math&gt;x_0=1&lt;/math&gt;, and this is shuffled into various locations during the expansion of the sum over shuffles.  The shuffle follows directly from the first axiom of a co-algebra: the relative order of the elements &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt; is ''preserved'' in the riffle shuffle: the riffle shuffle merely splits the ordered sequence into two ordered sequences, one on the left, and one on the right.

Observe that the coproduct preserves the grading of the algebra. That is, one has that
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta:\Lambda^k(V) \to \bigoplus_{p=0}^k \Lambda^p(V) \otimes\Lambda^{k-p}(V)&lt;/math&gt;

The tensor symbol ⊗ used in this section should be understood with some caution: it is ''not'' the same tensor symbol as the one being used in the definition of the alternating product.  Intuitively, it is perhaps easiest to think it as just another, but different, tensor product: it is still (bi-)linear, as tensor products should be, but it is the product that is appropriate for the definition of a bialgebra, that is, for creating the object {{nowrap|Λ(''V'') ⊗ Λ(''V'').}} Any lingering doubt can be shaken by pondering the equalities {{nowrap|1=(1 ⊗ ''v'') ∧ (1 ⊗ ''w'') = 1 ⊗ (''v'' ∧ ''w'')}} and {{nowrap|1=(''v'' ⊗ 1) ∧ (1 ⊗ ''w'') = ''v'' ⊗ ''w''}}, which follow from the definition of the coalgebra, as opposed to naive manipulations involving the tensor and wedge symbols. This distinction is developed in greater detail in the article on [[tensor algebra]]s. Here, there is much less of a problem, in that the alternating product Λ clearly corresponds to multiplication in the bialgebra, leaving the symbol ⊗ free for use in the definition of the bialgebra. In practice, this presents no particular problem, as long as one avoids the fatal trap of replacing alternating sums of ⊗ by the wedge symbol, with one exception. One can construct an alternating product from ⊗, with the understanding that it works in a different space. Immediately below, an example is given: the alternating product for the ''dual space'' can be given in terms of the coproduct. The construction of the bialgebra here parallels the construction in the [[tensor algebra]] article almost exactly, except for the need to correctly track the alternating signs for the exterior algebra.

In terms of the coproduct, the exterior product on the dual space is just the graded dual of the coproduct:

:&lt;math&gt;(\alpha\wedge\beta)(x_1\wedge\cdots\wedge x_k) = (\alpha\otimes\beta)\left(\Delta(x_1\wedge\cdots\wedge x_k)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the tensor product on the right-hand side is of multilinear linear maps (extended by zero on elements of incompatible homogeneous degree: more precisely, {{nowrap|1=''α'' ∧ ''β'' = ''ε'' ∘ (''α'' ⊗ ''β'') ∘ Δ}}, where ''ε'' is the counit, as defined presently).

The '''counit''' is the homomorphism {{nowrap|1=''ε'' : Λ(''V'') → ''K''}} that returns the 0-graded component of its argument. The coproduct and counit, along with the exterior product, define the structure of a [[bialgebra]] on the exterior algebra.

With an '''antipode''' defined on homogeneous elements by &lt;math&gt;S(x)=(-1)^{\binom{\text{deg}\,  x\, +1}{2}}x&lt;/math&gt;, the exterior algebra is furthermore a [[Hopf algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;Indeed, the exterior algebra of ''V'' is the [[Universal enveloping algebra|enveloping algebra]] of the abelian [[Lie superalgebra]] structure on ''V''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interior product===
{{See also|Interior product}}
Suppose that ''V'' is finite-dimensional. If ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the [[dual space]] to the vector space ''V'', then for each {{nowrap|''α'' ∈ ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}, it is possible to define an [[derivation (abstract algebra)|antiderivation]] on the algebra Λ(''V''),

:&lt;math&gt;i_\alpha:\Lambda^k V\rightarrow\Lambda^{k-1}V.&lt;/math&gt;

This derivation is called the '''interior product''' with ''α'', or sometimes the '''insertion operator''', or '''contraction''' by ''α''.

Suppose that {{nowrap|'''w''' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''V''}}. Then '''w''' is a multilinear mapping of ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; to ''K'', so it is defined by its values on the ''k''-fold [[Cartesian product]] {{nowrap|''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; × ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; × ... × ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}. If ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''k''−1&lt;/sub&gt; are {{nowrap|''k'' − 1}} elements of ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, then define

:&lt;math&gt;(i_\alpha {\mathbf w})(u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_{k-1})={\mathbf w}(\alpha,u_1,u_2,\ldots, u_{k-1}).&lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, let {{nowrap|1=''i''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' = 0}} whenever ''f'' is a pure scalar (i.e., belonging to Λ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;''V'').

====Axiomatic characterization and properties====
The interior product satisfies the following properties:

# For each ''k'' and each {{nowrap|''α'' ∈ ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}},
#::&lt;math&gt;i_\alpha:\Lambda^kV\rightarrow \Lambda^{k-1}V.&lt;/math&gt;
#:(By convention, {{nowrap|1=Λ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' = {0}.}})
# If ''v'' is an element of ''V'' (= Λ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''V''), then {{nowrap|1=''i''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;''v'' = ''α''(''v'')}} is the dual pairing between elements of ''V'' and elements of ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.
# For each {{nowrap|''α'' ∈ ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[graded derivation]] of degree −1:
#::&lt;math&gt;i_\alpha (a\wedge b) = (i_\alpha a)\wedge b + (-1)^{\deg a}a\wedge (i_\alpha b).&lt;/math&gt;

These three properties are sufficient to characterize the interior product as well as define it in the general infinite-dimensional case.

Further properties of the interior product include:
:* &lt;math&gt;i_\alpha\circ i_\alpha = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt;i_\alpha\circ i_\beta = -i_\beta\circ i_\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--
It may be worth saying something about this, but has already been mentioned in passing above.

===The duality isomorphism===
In general, there are two different kinds of alternating structures defined via duality:
* The structure of alternating multilinear forms on Λ(''V''). The space of all such forms is the graded dual Λ(''V'')&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, and the product of such forms dualizes the coproduct on the exterior algebra.
* The exterior algebra of the dual vector space Λ(''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;).
If ''V'' is finite-dimensional, then these two exterior algebras are naturally isomorphic.
--&gt;

===Hodge duality===
{{main article|Hodge star operator}}
Suppose that ''V'' has finite dimension ''n''. Then the interior product induces a canonical isomorphism of vector spaces
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^k(V^*) \otimes \Lambda^n(V) \to \Lambda^{n-k}(V) &lt;/math&gt;
by the recursive definition
:&lt;math&gt;i_{\alpha \wedge \beta} = i_\beta \circ i_\alpha .&lt;/math&gt;

In the geometrical setting, a non-zero element of the top exterior power Λ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') (which is a one-dimensional vector space) is sometimes called a '''[[volume form]]''' (or '''orientation form''', although this term may sometimes lead to ambiguity). Relative to a given volume form ''σ'', the isomorphism is given explicitly by

:&lt;math&gt; \Lambda^k(V^*) \to \Lambda^{n-k}(V) : \alpha \mapsto i_\alpha\sigma .&lt;/math&gt;

If, in addition to a volume form, the vector space ''V'' is equipped with an [[inner product]] identifying ''V'' with ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, then the resulting isomorphism is called the '''Hodge star operator''', which maps an element to its '''Hodge dual''':

:&lt;math&gt;\star : \Lambda^k(V) \rightarrow \Lambda^{n-k}(V) .&lt;/math&gt;

The composition of &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; with itself maps {{nowrap|Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') → Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}} and is always a scalar multiple of the identity map. In most applications, the volume form is compatible with the inner product in the sense that it is an exterior product of an [[orthonormal basis]] of ''V''. In this case,
:&lt;math&gt;\star \circ \star : \Lambda^k(V) \to \Lambda^k(V) = (-1)^{k(n-k) + q}\mathrm{id}&lt;/math&gt;
where id is the identity mapping, and the inner product has [[metric signature]] {{nowrap|(''p'', ''q'')}} — ''p'' pluses and ''q'' minuses.

===Inner product===
For ''V'' a finite-dimensional space, an [[inner product]] on ''V'' defines an isomorphism of ''V'' with ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, and so also an isomorphism of Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' with (Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''V'')&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.  The pairing between these two spaces also takes the form of an inner product.  On decomposable ''k''-vectors,
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle v_1\wedge\cdots\wedge v_k, w_1\wedge\cdots\wedge w_k\right\rangle = \det(\langle v_i,w_j\rangle),&lt;/math&gt;
the determinant of the matrix of inner products.  In the special case {{nowrap|1=''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the inner product is the square norm of the ''k''-vector, given by the determinant of the [[Gramian matrix]] {{nowrap|({{langle}}''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;{{rangle}})}}.  This is then extended bilinearly (or sesquilinearly in the complex case) to a non-degenerate inner product on Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''V''.  If ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, {{nowrap|1=''i'' = 1, 2, ..., ''n''}}, form an [[orthonormal basis]] of ''V'', then the vectors of the form
:&lt;math&gt;e_{i_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge e_{i_k},\quad i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k,&lt;/math&gt;
constitute an orthonormal basis for Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'').

With respect to the inner product, exterior multiplication and the interior product are mutually adjoint.  Specifically, for {{nowrap|'''v''' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}}, {{nowrap|'''w''' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}}, and {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''V''}},
:&lt;math&gt;\langle x\wedge\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}\rangle = \langle \mathbf{v}, i_{x^\flat}\mathbf{w}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
where {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sup&gt;♭&lt;/sup&gt; ∈ ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the linear functional defined by
:&lt;math&gt;x^\flat(y) = \langle x, y\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
for all {{nowrap|''y'' ∈ ''V''}}.  This property completely characterizes the inner product on the exterior algebra.

Indeed, more generally for {{nowrap|'''v''' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&amp;minus;''l''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}}, {{nowrap|'''w''' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}}, and {{nowrap|'''x''' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}}, iteration of the above adjoint properties gives
:&lt;math&gt;\langle \mathbf{x} \wedge\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}\rangle = \langle \mathbf{v}, i_{\mathbf{x}^\flat}\mathbf{w}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
where now {{nowrap|'''x'''&lt;sup&gt;♭&lt;/sup&gt; ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;) ≃ (Λ&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V''))&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the dual ''l''-vector defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}^\flat(\mathbf{y}) = \langle \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
for all {{nowrap|'''y''' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}}.

==Functoriality==
Suppose that ''V'' and ''W'' are a pair of vector spaces and {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} is a [[linear transformation]]. Then, by the universal construction, there exists a unique homomorphism of graded algebras

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(f) : \Lambda(V)\rightarrow \Lambda(W)&lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(f)\left|_{\Lambda^1(V)}\right. = f : V=\Lambda^1(V)\rightarrow W=\Lambda^1(W).&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, Λ(''f'') preserves homogeneous degree. The ''k''-graded components of Λ(''f'') are given on decomposable elements by
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(f)(x_1\wedge \cdots \wedge x_k) = f(x_1)\wedge\cdots\wedge f(x_k).&lt;/math&gt;

Let

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^k(f) = \Lambda(f)\left|_{\Lambda^k(V)}\right. : \Lambda^k(V) \rightarrow \Lambda^k(W).&lt;/math&gt;

The components of the transformation Λ(''f'') relative to a basis of ''V'' and ''W'' is the matrix of {{nowrap|''k'' × ''k''}} minors of ''f''. In particular, if {{nowrap|1=''V'' = ''W''}} and ''V'' is of finite dimension ''n'', then Λ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''f'') is a mapping of a one-dimensional vector space Λ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' to itself, and is therefore given by a scalar: the [[determinant]] of ''f''.

===Exactness===
If

:&lt;math&gt;0\rightarrow U\rightarrow V\rightarrow W\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[short exact sequence]] of vector spaces, then

:&lt;math&gt;0\to \Lambda^1(U)\wedge\Lambda(V) \to \Lambda(V)\rightarrow \Lambda(W)\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

is an exact sequence of graded vector spaces&lt;ref&gt;This part of the statement also holds in greater generality if ''V'' and ''W'' are modules over a commutative ring: That Λ converts epimorphisms to epimorphisms. See {{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1989|loc=Proposition 3, §III.7.2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as is
:&lt;math&gt;0\to \Lambda(U)\to\Lambda(V).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This statement generalizes only to the case where ''V'' and ''W'' are projective modules over a commutative ring. Otherwise, it is generally not the case that Λ converts monomorphisms to monomorphisms. See {{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1989|loc=Corollary to Proposition 12, §III.7.9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Direct sums ===
In particular, the exterior algebra of a direct sum is isomorphic to the tensor product of the exterior algebras:

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(V\oplus W)\cong\Lambda(V)\otimes\Lambda(W).&lt;/math&gt;

This is a graded isomorphism; i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^k(V\oplus W)\cong\bigoplus_{p+q=k} \Lambda^p(V)\otimes\Lambda^q(W).&lt;/math&gt;

Slightly more generally, if

:&lt;math&gt;0\rightarrow U\rightarrow V\rightarrow W\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[short exact sequence]] of vector spaces then Λ''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;(V)'' has a [[Filtration (mathematics)|filtration]]

:&lt;math&gt;0 = F^0 \subseteq F^1 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq F^k \subseteq F^{k+1} = \Lambda^k(V)&lt;/math&gt;

with quotients :&lt;math&gt;F^{p+1}/F^p = \Lambda^{k-p}(U) \otimes \Lambda^p(W)&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, if ''U'' is 1-dimensional then

:&lt;math&gt;0\rightarrow U \otimes \Lambda^{k-1}(W) \rightarrow \Lambda^k(V)\rightarrow \Lambda^k(W)\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

is exact, and if ''W'' is 1-dimensional then

:&lt;math&gt;0\rightarrow \Lambda^k(U) \rightarrow \Lambda^k(V)\rightarrow \Lambda^{k-1}(U) \otimes W\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

is exact.&lt;ref&gt;Such a filtration also holds for [[vector bundle]]s, and projective modules over a commutative ring. This is thus more general than the result quoted above for direct sums, since not every short exact sequence splits in other [[abelian category|abelian categories]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternating tensor algebra==
If ''K'' is a field of characteristic 0,&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1989|loc=§III.7.5}} for generalizations.&lt;/ref&gt; then the exterior algebra of a vector space ''V'' can be canonically identified with the vector subspace of T(''V'') consisting of [[antisymmetric tensor]]s. Recall that the exterior algebra is the quotient of T(''V'') by the ideal ''I'' generated by {{nowrap|''x'' ⊗ ''x''}}.

Let T&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') be the space of homogeneous tensors of degree ''r''. This is spanned by decomposable tensors

:&lt;math&gt;v_1\otimes\cdots\otimes v_r,\quad v_i\in V.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''antisymmetrization''' (or sometimes the '''skew-symmetrization''') of a decomposable tensor is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Alt}(v_1\otimes\cdots\otimes v_r) = \frac{1}{r!}\sum_{\sigma\in\mathfrak{S}_r} \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma) v_{\sigma(1)}\otimes\cdots\otimes v_{\sigma(r)}&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum is taken over the [[symmetric group]] of permutations on the symbols {{nowrap|{1, ..., ''r''}.}} This extends by linearity and homogeneity to an operation, also denoted by Alt, on the full tensor algebra T(''V''). The image Alt(T(''V'')) is the '''alternating tensor algebra''', denoted A(''V''). This is a vector subspace of T(''V''), and it inherits the structure of a graded vector space from that on T(''V''). It carries an associative graded product &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\otimes}&lt;/math&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt;t~\widehat{\otimes}~s = \operatorname{Alt}(t\otimes s).&lt;/math&gt;

Although this product differs from the tensor product, the kernel of ''Alt'' is precisely the ideal ''I'' (again, assuming that ''K'' has characteristic 0), and there is a canonical isomorphism

:&lt;math&gt;A(V)\cong \Lambda(V).&lt;/math&gt;

===Index notation===
Suppose that ''V'' has finite dimension ''n'', and that a basis {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of ''V'' is given. then any alternating tensor {{nowrap|''t'' ∈ A&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') ⊂ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}} can be written in [[index notation]] as

:&lt;math&gt;t = t^{i_1i_2\cdots i_r}\, {\mathbf e}_{i_1}\otimes {\mathbf e}_{i_2}\otimes\cdots\otimes {\mathbf e}_{i_r},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;⋅⋅⋅''i''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is [[antisymmetric tensor|completely antisymmetric]] in its indices.

The exterior product of two alternating tensors ''t'' and ''s'' of ranks ''r'' and ''p'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;t~\widehat{\otimes}~s = \frac{1}{(r+p)!}\sum_{\sigma\in {\mathfrak S}_{r+p}}\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)t^{i_{\sigma(1)}\cdots i_{\sigma(r)}} s^{i_{\sigma(r+1)} \cdots i_{\sigma(r+p)}} {\mathbf e}_{i_1}\otimes {\mathbf e}_{i_2} \otimes \cdots\otimes {\mathbf e}_{i_{r+p}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The components of this tensor are precisely the skew part of the components of the tensor product {{nowrap|''s'' ⊗ ''t''}}, denoted by square brackets on the indices:

:&lt;math&gt;(t~\widehat{\otimes}~s)^{i_1\cdots i_{r+p}} = t^{[i_1\cdots i_r}s^{i_{r+1}\cdots i_{r+p}]}.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--For the interior product--&gt;
The interior product may also be described in index notation as follows. Let &lt;math&gt;t = t^{i_0i_1\cdots i_{r-1}}&lt;/math&gt; be an antisymmetric tensor of rank ''r''. Then, for {{nowrap|''α'' ∈ ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;''t'' is an alternating tensor of rank {{nowrap|''r'' − 1}}, given by

:&lt;math&gt;(i_\alpha t)^{i_1\cdots i_{r-1}}=r\sum_{j=0}^n\alpha_j t^{ji_1\cdots i_{r-1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the dimension of ''V''.

==Applications==

===Linear algebra===
In applications to [[linear algebra]], the exterior product provides an abstract algebraic manner for describing the [[determinant]] and the [[minor (matrix)|minors]] of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].  For instance, it is well known that the magnitude of the determinant of a square matrix is equal to the volume of the parallelotope whose sides are the columns of the matrix.  This suggests that the determinant can be ''defined'' in terms of the exterior product of the column vectors.  Likewise, the {{nowrap|''k'' × ''k''}} minors of a matrix can be defined by looking at the exterior products of column vectors chosen ''k'' at a time.  These ideas can be extended not just to matrices but to [[linear transformation]]s as well: the magnitude of the determinant of a linear transformation is the factor by which it scales the volume of any given reference parallelotope.  So the determinant of a linear transformation can be defined in terms of what the transformation does to the top exterior power.  The action of a transformation on the lesser exterior powers gives a [[basis of a vector space|basis]]-independent way to talk about the minors of the transformation.

====Technical details: Definitions====
Let&lt;ref&gt;S.Winitzki, ''Lineaer Algebra via Exterior Products'', https://sites.google.com/site/winitzki/linalg&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be an ''n''-dimensional vector space over field &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; with basis &lt;math&gt;\{e_1,\ldots,e_n\}&lt;/math&gt;. 
* For &lt;math&gt;A \in \operatorname{End}(V)&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^k A \in \operatorname{End}(\Lambda^k V) &lt;/math&gt; on simple tensors by

:: &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^k A(v_1 \wedge\cdots\wedge v_k)=Av_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge Av_k &lt;/math&gt;

:and expand the definition linearly to all tensors. More generally, we can define &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^p A^k \in \operatorname{End}(\Lambda^p V), (p \geq k) &lt;/math&gt; on simple tensors by

:: &lt;math&gt;(\Lambda^p A^k)(v_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_p)=\sum_{0 \leq i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k \leq p} v_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge Av_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge Av_{i_k} \wedge \cdots \wedge v_p&lt;/math&gt;

:i.e. choose ''k'' components on which ''A'' would act, then sum up all results obtained from different choices. If &lt;math&gt;p&lt;k&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^pA^k=0 &lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^n V &lt;/math&gt; is 1-dimensional with basis &lt;math&gt;e_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge e_n&lt;/math&gt;, we can identify &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^n A^k &lt;/math&gt; with the unique number &lt;math&gt;\kappa \in K &lt;/math&gt; satisfying

:: &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^n A^k (e_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge e_n) = \kappa (e_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge e_n) .&lt;/math&gt;

* For &lt;math&gt;\varphi \in \operatorname{End}(\Lambda^p V)&lt;/math&gt;, define the '''exterior transpose''' &lt;math&gt;\varphi^\mathrm{T} \in \operatorname{End}(\Lambda^{n-p} V)&lt;/math&gt; to be the unique operator satisfying

:: &lt;math&gt;\forall \omega_p \in \Lambda^p V, \omega_{n-p} \in \Lambda^{n-p}V, (\varphi^\mathrm{T}\omega_{n-p})\wedge\omega_p=\omega_{n-p}\wedge(\varphi \omega_p)&lt;/math&gt;

* For &lt;math&gt;A \in \operatorname{End}(V)&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;\det A=\Lambda^n A^n, \operatorname{Tr}(A)=\Lambda^n A^1, \operatorname{adj} A=(\Lambda^{n-1} A^{n-1})^\mathrm{T} &lt;/math&gt;. These definitions is equivalent to the other versions.

====Basic Properties====
All results obtained from other definitions of the determinant, trace and adjoint can be obtained from this definition (since these definitions are equivalent). Here are some basic properties related to these new definitions:
* &lt;math&gt;(\cdot)^\mathrm{T}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;-linear.
* &lt;math&gt;(AB)^\mathrm{T} = B^\mathrm{T} A^\mathrm{T}&lt;/math&gt;.
* We have a canonical isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\psi:\operatorname{End}(\Lambda^k V) \cong \operatorname{End}(\Lambda^{n-k} V), A \mapsto A^\mathrm{T}&lt;/math&gt;. (However, there is no canonical isomorphism between &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^k V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{n-k} V&lt;/math&gt;).
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}(\Lambda^k A) = \Lambda^n A^k&lt;/math&gt;. The entries of the transposed matrix of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^k A&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;k \times k&lt;/math&gt;-minors of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\forall k \leq n-1, p \leq k, A \in \operatorname{End}(V), \sum_{q=0}^p (\Lambda^{n-k} A^{p-q})^\mathrm{T} (\Lambda^k A^q) = (\Lambda^n A^p) \operatorname{Id} \in \operatorname{End}(V)&lt;/math&gt;. In particular,
::&lt;math&gt;(\Lambda^{n-1} A^{p-1})^\mathrm{T} A + (\Lambda^{n-1} A^p)^\mathrm{T} = (\Lambda^n A^p) \operatorname{Id}&lt;/math&gt;
:and hence
::&lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{adj} A)A = (\Lambda^{n-1} A^{n-1})^\mathrm{T} A = (\Lambda^n A^n) \operatorname{Id} = (\det A)\operatorname{Id}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;(\Lambda^{n-1} A^p)^T = \sum_{q=0}^p (\Lambda^n A^{p-q})(-A)^q = \sum_{q=0}^p \operatorname{Tr}(\Lambda^{p-q} A)(-A)^q&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, 
::&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{adj} A = \sum_{q=0}^{n-1} (\Lambda^n A^{n-q-1})(-A)^q&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}(\Lambda^k \operatorname{adj} A) = \Lambda^n (\operatorname{adj} A)^k = (\det A)^{k-1} (\Lambda^n A^{n-k}) = (\det A)^{k-1} \operatorname{Tr}(\Lambda^{n-k} A)&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}((\Lambda^{n-1} A^k)^\mathrm{T})=(n-k) \Lambda^n A^p=(n-k) \operatorname{Tr}(\Lambda^p A)&lt;/math&gt;.
* The characteristic polynomial &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ch}_A(t)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A \in \operatorname{End}(V)&lt;/math&gt; can be given by
::&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ch}_A(t)=\sum_{k=0}^n \operatorname{Tr}(\Lambda^k A)(-t)^{n-k} = \sum_{k=0}^n (\Lambda^n A^k)(-t)^{n-k} .&lt;/math&gt;
:Similarly,
::&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ch}_{\operatorname{adj} A}(t)=\sum_{k=0}^n (\Lambda^n(\operatorname{adj} A)^k)(-t)^{n-k} = \sum_{k=0}^n (\det A)^{k-1}(\Lambda^n A^{n-k})(-t)^{n-k}&lt;/math&gt;

====Leverrier's Algorithm====
&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^n A^k&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;(-t)^{n-k}&lt;/math&gt; term in the characteristic polynomial. They also appear in the expressions of &lt;math&gt;(\Lambda^{n-1} A^p)^\mathrm{T}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^n (\operatorname{adj} A)^k&lt;/math&gt;. Leverrier's Algorithm&lt;ref&gt;W.Kahan (2009), ''Jordan's normal form''. https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/MathH110/jordan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is an economical way of computing &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^n A^k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{n-1} A^k&lt;/math&gt;:

::Set &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{n-1} A^0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;;

::For &lt;math&gt;k=n-1,n-2,\ldots,1,0&lt;/math&gt;,

:::&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^n A^{n-k} = \frac{1}{n-k} \operatorname{Tr}(A \circ \Lambda^{n-1} A^{n-k-1})&lt;/math&gt;;

:::&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{n-1} A^{n-k} = \Lambda^n A^{n-k} \cdot \operatorname{Id} - A \circ \Lambda^{n-1} A^{n-k-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Physics===
In physics, many quantities are naturally represented by alternating operators. For example, if the motion of a charged particle is described by velocity and acceleration vectors in four-dimensional spacetime, then normalization of the velocity vector requires that the electromagnetic force must be an alternating operator on the velocity. Its six degrees of freedom are identified with the electric and magnetic fields.

===Linear geometry===
The decomposable ''k''-vectors have geometric interpretations: the bivector {{math|''u'' ∧ ''v''}} represents the plane spanned by the vectors, "weighted" with a number, given by the area of the oriented [[parallelogram]] with sides ''u'' and ''v''. Analogously, the 3-vector {{math|''u'' ∧ ''v'' ∧ ''w''}} represents the spanned 3-space weighted by the volume of the oriented [[parallelepiped]] with edges ''u'', ''v'', and ''w''.

===Projective geometry===
Decomposable ''k''-vectors in Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' correspond to weighted ''k''-dimensional [[linear subspace]]s of ''V''. In particular, the [[Grassmannian]] of ''k''-dimensional subspaces of ''V'', denoted ''Gr''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''V''), can be naturally identified with an [[algebraic variety|algebraic subvariety]] of the [[projective space]] '''P'''(Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''V''). This is called the [[Plücker embedding]].

===Differential geometry===
The exterior algebra has notable applications in [[differential geometry]], where it is used to define [[differential form]]s. A [[differential form]] at a point of a [[differentiable manifold]] is an alternating multilinear form on the [[tangent space]] at the point. Equivalently, a differential form of degree ''k'' is a [[linear functional]] on the ''k''-th exterior power of the tangent space. As a consequence, the exterior product of multilinear forms defines a natural exterior product for differential forms. Differential forms play a major role in diverse areas of differential geometry.

In particular, the [[exterior derivative]] gives the exterior algebra of differential forms on a manifold the structure of a [[differential algebra]]. The exterior derivative commutes with [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] along smooth mappings between manifolds, and it is therefore a [[natural transformation|natural]] [[differential operator]]. The exterior algebra of differential forms, equipped with the exterior derivative, is a [[cochain complex]] whose cohomology is called the [[de Rham cohomology]] of the underlying manifold and plays a vital role in the [[algebraic topology]] of differentiable manifolds.

===Representation theory===
In [[representation theory]], the exterior algebra is one of the two fundamental [[Schur functor]]s on the category of vector spaces, the other being the [[symmetric algebra]]. Together, these constructions are used to generate the [[irreducible representation]]s of the [[general linear group]]; see [[fundamental representation]].

===Superspace===
The exterior algebra over the complex numbers is the archetypal example of a [[superalgebra]], which plays a fundamental role in physical theories pertaining to [[fermion]]s and [[supersymmetry]]. A single element of the exterior algebra is called a '''supernumber'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryce DeWitt]], ''Supermanifolds'', (1984) Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-42377-5}}. ''(See Chapter 1, page 1.)''&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Grassmann number]]. The exterior algebra itself is then just a one-dimensional [[superspace]]: it is just the set of all of the points in the exterior algebra. The topology on this space is essentially the [[weak topology]], the [[open sets]] being the [[cylinder set]]s.  An {{math|''n''}}-dimensional superspace is just the {{math|''n''}}-fold product of exterior algebras.

===Lie algebra homology===
Let ''L'' be a Lie algebra over a field ''K'', then it is possible to define the structure of a [[chain complex]] on the exterior algebra of ''L''. This is a ''K''-linear mapping
:&lt;math&gt;\partial : \Lambda^{p+1}L\to\Lambda^pL&lt;/math&gt;
defined on decomposable elements by
:&lt;math&gt;\partial (x_1\wedge\cdots\wedge x_{p+1}) = \frac{1}{p+1}\sum_{j&lt;\ell}(-1)^{j+\ell+1}[x_j,x_\ell]\wedge x_1\wedge\cdots\wedge \hat{x}_j\wedge\cdots\wedge\hat{x}_\ell\wedge\cdots\wedge x_{p+1}.&lt;/math&gt;
The [[Jacobi identity]] holds if and only if {{nowrap|1=∂∂ = 0}}, and so this is a necessary and sufficient condition for an anticommutative nonassociative algebra ''L'' to be a Lie algebra.  Moreover, in that case Λ''L'' is a [[chain complex]] with boundary operator ∂.  The [[homology theory|homology]] associated to this complex is the [[Lie algebra homology]].

===Homological algebra===
The exterior algebra is the main ingredient in the construction of the [[Koszul complex]], a fundamental object in [[homological algebra]].

== History ==
The exterior algebra was first introduced by [[Hermann Grassmann]] in 1844 under the blanket term of ''Ausdehnungslehre'', or ''Theory of Extension''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Kannenberg|2000}} published a translation of Grassmann's work in English; he translated ''Ausdehnungslehre'' as ''Extension Theory''.&lt;/ref&gt;
This referred more generally to an algebraic (or axiomatic) theory of extended quantities and was one of the early precursors to the modern notion of a [[vector space]]. [[Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant|Saint-Venant]] also published similar ideas of exterior calculus for which he claimed priority over Grassmann.&lt;ref&gt;J Itard, Biography in Dictionary of Scientific Biography (New York 1970–1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

The algebra itself was built from a set of rules, or axioms, capturing the formal aspects of Cayley and Sylvester's theory of multivectors. It was thus a ''calculus'', much like the [[propositional calculus]], except focused exclusively on the task of formal reasoning in geometrical terms.&lt;ref&gt;Authors have in the past referred to this calculus variously as the ''calculus of extension'' ({{harvnb|Whitehead|1898}}; {{harvnb|Forder|1941}}), or ''extensive algebra'' {{harv|Clifford|1878}}, and recently as ''extended vector algebra'' {{harv|Browne|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, this new development allowed for an ''axiomatic'' characterization of dimension, a property that had previously only been examined from the coordinate point of view.

The import of this new theory of vectors and [[multivector]]s was lost to mid 19th century mathematicians,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1989|p=661}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
until being thoroughly vetted by [[Giuseppe Peano]] in 1888. Peano's work also remained somewhat obscure until the turn of the century, when the subject was unified by members of the French geometry school (notably [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Élie Cartan]], and [[Gaston Darboux]]) who applied Grassmann's ideas to the calculus of [[differential form]]s.

A short while later, [[Alfred North Whitehead]], borrowing from the ideas of Peano and Grassmann, introduced his [[universal algebra]]. This then paved the way for the 20th century developments of [[abstract algebra]] by placing the axiomatic notion of an algebraic system on a firm logical footing.

The '''fading affect bias''', more commonly known as '''FAB''', is a [[psychology|psychological]] phenomenon in which information regarding negative [[emotion]]s tends to be forgotten more quickly than that associated with pleasant emotions. Although there have been some contradictory findings regarding the presence of FAB, it has been largely found to be real.

==Description==

Initially, the Fading Affect Bias was widely accepted as the process whereby the emotional [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of certain events fades over time. More specifically, early researchers largely believed that there was a general fading over time of emotional content and intensity in relation to specific life events, regardless of whether the experiences were positive ones or negative ones. However, later studies found that cognitive processes occur that cause the emotional intensity of negative events to dissipate at a faster rate than positively perceived events. Many conclusions have been drawn regarding FAB, and many explanations have been proposed for why it even exists.

==Related studies==

Some of the earliest evidence and argument for the [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] of the Fading Affect Bias can be dated back to {{harvtxt|Cason|1932}}'s [[experiment|study]]. In this study, a [[retrospective]] procedure was put into effect, which entailed the recollection of past events as well as a rating of the emotions which the respective events prompted. [[Data]] from this study reflected that the recalling of positive events was generally stronger than that of negative events. However, criticism of this study centered upon the fact that retrospective and introspective procedures could possibly be subject to memory biases. Thus, a later study&amp;mdash;{{harvtxt|Holmes|1970}}&amp;mdash;took a "non-introspective" approach to studying FAB. Twenty-six subjects were told to record events in a diary and record the emotional intensities of the experiences. Data results from these studies were found to be generally consistent with FAB.

Publication from {{harvtxt|Walker et al.|1997}} has been viewed as the "modern era" of FAB studies. In a 1997 publication, Walker discussed the role which memory plays in FAB. Here, it is stated that [[human being]]s are preferential in what they select to remember and that certain particulars of events fade, but emotions necessarily do not. Walker used a [[diary]] recording method to analyze the cognitive processes of a sample of [[White People|Caucasian]] [[Undergraduate education|undergraduates]]. This study found that emotions prompted by positive events were more likely to last than those prompted by negative occurrences. Nonetheless, later studies were conducted by others which were more representative of the [[population]], in that they included people of various [[Race (human classification)|races]], different [[socioeconomic status]]es, and both [[gender]]s.

{{harvtxt|Ritchie et al.|2009}} used subject's personal responses to 1200 [[autobiographical]] events to study the Fading Affect Bias. In this study, four possible trends were found regarding memory: the Fixed Affect (wherein emotional intensity is maintained), the Fading Affect (wherein emotional intensity diminishes), the Flourishing Affect (where there is an increase in intensity), and the Flexible Affect (where there is a reversal of valence). For positive recollections, the Fixed Affect was more prominent (39%) than the Fading Affect (37%). However, for negative occurrences, the Fading Affect was more prominent (51%) than the Fixed Affect (38%). Instances of the Flourishing Affect and the Flexible Affect were significantly low for both instances.

In addition to the aforementioned psychological studies, related [[neurobiological]] studies were conducted that could possibly further explain the phenomenon of FAB. During an [[interview]], [[neurobiologist]] Matt Wilson detailed that in studying the [[brain activity]] of [[rat]]s it was found that the remembrance of past events and the anticipation of future events seemed to be linked neurologically.{{sfn|Blue|2008}} This is a possible implication of why FAB exists: the human need to catalog relevant information to be used in the future.

==Freudian influence on research==

[[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[theory]] of repression was used during initial research of FAB. A key tenet of the FAB theory is that certain emotional intensities dissipate over the course of time. Freud's theory of repression, however, implies that while specific event memories can be eventually forgotten over time, accompanying emotions remain unbothered. Also, it states that intense emotions are more likely to be remembered, but "not necessarily the substance of."{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Possible explanations==

Researchers have drawn many conclusions regarding why FAB occurs. A popular explanation for FAB among psychologists and researchers alike is the need for healthy self-awareness and positive self-esteem. It has been largely found that FAB is more prevalent among mentally healthy individuals as opposed to those who suffer from [[Mental dysfunction|mental]] and [[Neurological disorder|neurological dysfunction]]. More specifically, it has been established that people who suffer from even mild [[Depression (mood)|depression]] are more likely to maintain negative emotions from unpleasant experiences. Thus, it has been concluded that FAB allows one to have positive perception and be more likely to attain a positive self-image. In addition, it has been found that human beings have the tendency to alter their negative emotions into positive ones and to use certain negative occurrences as learning experiences. This too adds to having a positive outlook on life. Several things, such as [[self-image]], one's [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] disposition, the frequency of rehearsal, and "[[recreational drug use]]" are considered [[Moderator variable|moderators]] of FAB.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12607">In [[United States constitutional law]], '''false statements of fact''' are an [[United States free speech exceptions|exception from protection]] of free speech under the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. In [[United States law]], a false statement of fact will not be exempt from some civil or criminal penalty, if a law has imposed one. This exception has evolved over time from a series of Supreme Court cases that dealt with issues such as [[libel]], [[slander]], and statutes which barred fraudulent solicitation of charitable donations.

A major limiting factor to this concrete First Amendment exception are statements made against public figures. In ''[[New York Times v. Sullivan]]'' (1964), the Court strongly suggested that even "deliberate lies" could not be punished if made against the government. Since that decision, many cases that have dealt with this rule have struggled to define the line of who actually is a 'public figure'. The Supreme Court has also extended this doctrine to non-political figures who are simply famous or well known in the media.

==Overview of the legal rule==
===Theoretical basis for exception===

The [[United States Supreme Court]] first articulated the basis for excluding false statements of fact from First Amendment protection in ''[[Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.]]'' (1974). In that case, a monthly newspaper was sued by a policeman's attorney. The newspaper "contained serious inaccuracies" about the attorney; namely, that he was supporting the police system as a goal to entrench a Communist conspiracy in the United States.&lt;ref name=GERTZ/&gt; They held that a civil jury award against the newspaper was constitutional because "there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact".&lt;ref name=GERTZ/&gt; Justice [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.|Powell]], in writing the [[majority opinion|decision of the Court]] reasoned that false statements do not "advance society's interest in 'uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate'". Even though he conceded that some false statements were inevitable, that did not mean that a system of liability meant to deter such behavior was impermissible.&lt;ref name=VREMEDY/&gt; Society had some interest in ensuring that debate covered truthful matters, as a key element of public participation in a democracy.&lt;ref name=VFW/&gt;

===Basic substantive rule===

The legal rule itself – how to apply this exception – is complicated, as it is often dependent on ''who'' said the statement and ''which actor'' it was directed towards.&lt;ref name=VTHEORY/&gt; The analysis is thus different if the government or a public figure is the target of the false statement (where the speech may get more protection) than a private individual who is being attacked over a matter of their private life.&lt;ref name=DUN/&gt; Thus, a key starting point in the analysis will discuss the 'manner' and 'context' in which the statements were made.&lt;ref name=VRULE/&gt;

Professor [[Eugene Volokh]] of [[UCLA Law]] characterizes this context analysis as divided into five different areas. First, false statements of fact can lead to civil liability if they are "said with a sufficiently culpable mental state".&lt;ref name=VRULE/&gt; This possibly includes conscious lies about [[Stolen Valor Act|military service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|2009|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second category is a subset of the first: ''knowingly'' false statements ([[false statement|deliberate lies]]).&lt;ref name=VRULE/&gt; This includes things like [[libel]] and [[slander]]. These sorts of statements are specifically punishable because they contain malice.&lt;ref name=VPOLICY/&gt; A third category are "negligently" false statements, which may "lead to [some] liability".&lt;ref name=VRULE/&gt; A fourth included set includes statements that only have a "provable false factual connotation" – that is, implicit statements of fact. The example Volokh uses is the statement that "Joe deserves to die" which in the ''context'' of a murder could be made to be a factual statement.&lt;ref name=VFW/&gt;

The fifth category is one that is not as firmly set by precedent: false statements, even deliberate lies, against the government may be protected.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; While some "[[sedition|seditious libel]]" may be able to be punished, political statements are likely protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|2009|pp=5, 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remedies===

Punitive damages are sometimes available against an individual who made a public false statement of fact. Such damages are contingent on the plaintiff demonstrating "actual malice" (intent to do harm) in the [[litigation|lawsuit]].&lt;ref name=VREMEDY/&gt; Criminal liability, although uncommon, can be made although they are usually subject to the same limitations imposed on civil suits in terms of elements to be proven.&lt;ref&gt;[[Garrison v. Louisiana]], 379 U.S. 64 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories of analysis==
===Public officials/public concern===
False statements that are on matters of public concern and that defame public figures are unprotected if either the speaker has knowledge that his statements are false, there is a negligence in the statement, or there is "actual malice" to inflict harm.&lt;ref name=VFW/&gt; The "actual malice" test comes from the Supreme Court's decision ''[[New York Times v. Sullivan]]'' (1964). That case concerned an allegation of libel by L.B. Sullivan, a supervisor of the Montgomery, Alabama police department. Sullivan argued that a full-page advertisement in the New York Times incorrectly asserted that his police department let civil rights violations against blacks occur.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The Court held that even if the advertisement was incorrect, the fact that there was no intent to harm Sullivan by the newspaper ("actual malice") meant that the lawsuit could not proceed.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; This specific standard of [[mens rea]] is specifically to be used in cases where such speech comments on a matter of public concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Camp|2005|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis for this ruling was the Court's fear that "a rule compelling the critic of official conduct to guarantee the truth of all his factual assertions" would lead to "self-[[censorship]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Times v. Sullivan]], 376 U.S. at 279 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; This determination altered the theory of the 'false statements' free speech exception. Even if a false statement generally would be harmful for public discourse, the Court quoted [[John Stuart Mill]] in arguing a false statement in this context would bring "the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error".&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Times v. Sullivan]], 376 U.S. at 280 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Definition of public figures====

The Supreme Court has struggled to define who exactly is a public figure, but over fifty years of cases, a framework has become defined. The first grouping of public figures are government officials.&lt;ref name=VFW/&gt; The test of which government figures was articulated in the Court's ruling in ''[[Rosenblatt v. Baer]]'' (1966). In ''Rosenblatt'', the Court said that government positions subject to this rule were those in which the "public has an independent interest in the qualifications and performance of the person who holds it, beyond the general public interest in the qualifications and performance of all government employees".&lt;ref name=BAER/&gt; Additionally, a court must question whether the "employee's position is one which would involve public scrutiny and discussion of the person holding it".&lt;ref name=BAER/&gt; Along with government officials, the Supreme Court held in ''[[Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.]]'' (1974) that people who "have assumed an influential role in ordering society" are considered public figures.&lt;ref name=GERTZ/&gt; This is the same for people who have "achieved...pervasive fame or notoriety" or who have "voluntarily injected themselves or been drawn into a particular public controversy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Time, Inc. v. Firestone]], 424 U.S. 448 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; This has even been held to include [[Jerry Falwell]], a major religious figure in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hustler Magazine v. Falwell]], 485 U.S. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Issues "of public concern"====
The leading case on what an issue "of public concern" is ''[[Dun &amp; Bradstreet v. Greenmoss Builders]]'' (1985). In ''Dun &amp; Bradstreet'', the Supreme Court considered whether a credit reporting service which distributed fliers to their only five subscribers qualified as an action of "public concern". As it was "hardly and unlikely to be deterred by incidental state regulation", the Court concluded it did not qualify.&lt;ref name=DUN/&gt; This decision did not provide strong guidance on the issue.&lt;ref name=PCV/&gt;

This vague area of law in regards to false statements of fact can lead to a variety of arguments over what is relevant or has public importance.&lt;ref name=PCV/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy]], 401 U.S. 265 (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private individuals/public concern===
In ''[[Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.]]'' (1974), the Supreme Court considered an article published in a magazine published by the [[John Birch Society]]. The article contained inaccuracies about a private individual, in this case the attorney for a policeman. The Court held that because plaintiff Gertz had not "thrust himself into the vortex of this public issue", the newspaper could not be freed from liability of their false statements.&lt;ref name=GERTZ/&gt; That standard of being put into the public spotlight was used in ''[[Snyder v. Phelps]]'' (2010), which permitted false statements about a dead [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] because those comments were in the midst of a public debate about war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Snyder v. Phelps]] (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases which fall into this category, "actual malice" is the standard for a plaintiff to gain compensation at a trial.&lt;ref name=GERTZ/&gt;&lt;ref name="VPOLICY"/&gt;

===Private individuals/private concern===
The most ambiguous area of analysis for false statements of fact are cases that involve private individuals and speech about a private concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Volokh|2008|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most likely, a standard of strict liability would attach to speech under this section.&lt;ref name=VFW/&gt; Broadly speaking, this category includes speech that doesn't fit the limits of the "false statements of fact" free speech exception, meaning that such speech is not protected.&lt;ref name=GERTZ/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37150">'''Gender and security sector reform''' is an emerging subfield of [[security sector governance and reform|security sector reform]] (SSR) that is both practical and conceptual. SSR generally is a comprehensive framework within which all or part of a state's [[security sector]] undergoes a process of transformation in order to bring it more into line with principles such as democratic oversight, [[good governance]] and the [[rule of law]].&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, ''The OECD DAC Handbook on Security System Reform (SSR): Supporting Security and Justice'' (Paris: OECD, 2007), p. 21. Available at http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/development/the-oecd-dac-handbook-on-security-system-reform_9789264027862-en (Gender and Monitoring &amp; Evaluation Sections added in 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The overall objectives of SSR programmes – as defined both by the state in question and any international donors supporting the process – tend to include improving service delivery, enhancing local ownership and ensuring the sustainability of security sector institutions.&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt; As [[gender]]-specific approaches take into account the specific needs of men, women, boys and girls through [[gender mainstreaming]] and by promoting the equal participation of people of all genders in decision-making processes, states and international organisations increasingly consider them to be a necessary component of SSR programmes.&lt;ref&gt;Academically, gender-specific approaches would also incorporate the needs of people identifying as other gender identities such as intersex, queer and trans as well as regionally specific identities like kathoey, Two-Spirit and hijra. However, this is rarely seen in current SSR practice at this time.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
The need to integrate gender into SSR processes was recognised at the international level in 2008 by then-[[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations (UN) Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] in his report on SSR, where he stated that: "...the integration of a gender perspective in security sector reform is inherent to an inclusive and socially responsive approach to security. Gender-sensitive security sector reform", he went on, "is key to developing security sector institutions that are non-discriminatory, representative of the population and capable of effectively responding to the specific security needs of diverse groups."&lt;ref name ="UNSG Report"&gt;United Nations General Assembly and Security Council, ''Securing peace and development: the role of the United Nations in supporting security sector reform'', Report of the Secretary-General, 23 January 2008. UN Document No. [https://undocs.org/S/2008/39 A/62/659–S/2008/39]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the release of this report, the number of SSR programmes incorporating a gender dimension has increased dramatically, as has the amount of academic literature available and the number of specialists working in the area. Gender dimensions are often included in SSR processes as part of a country's commitment to [[UNSCR 1325|UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) (UNSCR 1325)]], which calls for wider female participation in all aspects of post-conflict reconstruction and for more consideration of the specific needs of women and girls.&lt;ref name="UNSCR 1325"&gt;United Nations Security Council, ''Resolution 1325 (2000)'', 31 October 2000, Document No. [https://undocs.org/S/RES/1325(2000) S/RES/1325 (2000)].&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Liberia's National Action Plan on [[UNSCR 1325]] makes provisions for strengthening the capacity of the SSR desk at the Ministry for Gender and Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ministry of Gender and Development|title=The Liberia National Action Plan for the implementation of United Nations Resolution 1325|year=2009|publisher=Government of Liberia|location=Monrovia|page=21|url=http://www.peacewomen.org/assets/file/NationalActionPlans/liberia_nationalactionplanmarch2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a decade after [[UNSCR 1325]] began to be implemented, the Security Council highlighted "the importance of addressing sexual violence in armed conflict and post-conflict situations in the context of security sector reform initiatives and arrangements, including training, vetting, and capacity-building of national security actors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=United Nations Security Council|title=Statement by the President of the Security Council |id=S/PRST/2012/3 |date=23 February 2012|url=https://undocs.org/S/PRST/2012/3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a US representative on the Security Council noted that the "integration of a gender perspective made institutions more inclusive and improved the overall effectiveness of security sector reform."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=United Nations Security Council|title=Effective, Professional, Accountable Security Sector at Cornerstone of Peace,  Sustainable Development, Security Council Stresses in Presidential Statement: Lessons Learned Could Become 'Lessons Lost', If Africa's Experience  With Security Sector Reform Not Utilized, Nigerian Foreign Minister Says in Debate|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10409.doc.htm|newspaper=UN Department of Public Information • News and Media Division • New York|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==

===Effective service delivery===
One of the key tenets of SSR is that the security sector should be designed to serve the security and justice needs of the population. A person's gender (along with other characteristics, such as age, class, ethnicity/clan/tribe/caste, and sexual orientation) plays an important part in his or her own security needs. Worldwide, women, men, girls and boys have different experiences in areas such as sexual violence, trafficking in human beings, gang violence, robbery, dowry deaths, abduction and so-called 'honour killings'. For example, over 90 percent of deaths related to firearms are male,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=World Health Organization|title=Small Arms and Global Health: WHO Contribution to the UN Conference on Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons, July 9–20, 2001|year=2001|publisher=WHO|location=Geneva|pages=3|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2001/WHO_NMH_VIP_01.1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in most countries, the proportion of women with male intimate partners who experience physical violence during the course of their relationship lies between one-quarter and one-half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garcia-Morena|first=Claudia|title=WHO Multi-country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence against Women|year=2005|publisher=WHO|location=Geneva|pages=xii|url=http://www.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/Introduction-Chapter1-Chapter2.pdf |author2=Henrica A.F.M. Jansen |author3=Mary Ellsberg |author4=Lori Heise |author5=Charlotte Watts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the world, women, men, girls and boys also have different access to resources such as land, money, education, healthcare and political power. Women own less than 15 percent of land worldwide and only 2 percent in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=United Nations Global Compact|title=Snapshot of Women Worldwide: Facts and Figures|publisher=UN|url=http://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/issues_doc/human_rights/Meetings_x_events/05Mar2009_PPT_Snapshot_Facts_and_Figures.pdf|date=March 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason, gender perspectives are a useful tool to achieving the security sector's objectives. For example, in order to encourage women who have been victims of SGBV to report the crime, it may be important to give them the option of speaking to a woman police officer, perhaps in a specialized police station.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unifem.org/attachments/gender_issues/women_war_peace/CaseStudiesOfGenderSensitivePoliceReformInRwandaAndTimorLeste_2009.pdf, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In cases where men are affected by SGBV, similar provisions may also be needed, as well as training for security sector personnel who may not be aware of the existence and extent of gender-based violence committed against men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Storr|first=Will|title=The rape of men|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/17/the-rape-of-men|newspaper=The Observer|date=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, an effective response will usually also involve public awareness campaigns highlighting the problem and the services available to survivors. It will probably also include forming partnerships between security providers (e.g. police, justice institutions and prisons), health care providers and civil society organisations, as part of a holistic approach to SSR.

More broadly, collaboration between security sector institutions and civil society groups involved in gender issues can increase the effectiveness of the security sector. Such groups can deliver training, support policy development, and on an ongoing basis provide complementary security and justice services and keep security forces informed about issues within communities.

A further gendered aspect of effective service delivery centres around the skills of security sector personnel themselves. Other societal factors tend to result in men and women having different skill sets. Consequently, if security sector institutions lack either male and female staff at any level, their staff will possess a smaller skill set, limiting their operational options. For example, studies in the USA found that American female police officers were more adept at policing without the use of excessive or deadly force than their male counterparts, although they were as likely to use force as men when absolutely necessary. As a result, male police officers cost US taxpayers between 2.5 and 5.5 times more in legal fees related to excessive force liability lawsuit payouts and are almost three times more likely to be threatened or attacked by citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lonsway|first=Dr. Kim |author2=Margaret Moore |author3=Chief Penny Harrington |author4=Eleanor Smeal |author5=Katherine Spillar|title=Hiring &amp; Retaining More Women: The Advantages to Law Enforcement Agencies|journal=National Center for Women &amp; Policing: a division of the Feminist Majority Foundation|date=Spring 2003|pages=4, 7|url=http://womenandpolicing.com/pdf/NewAdvantagesReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the proven ability of women to increase the skill set of police forces, the closest any police force has come to achieving gender balance is Estonia, where 33.5% of officers are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Resetnikova|first=Aigi|title=Women in Policing in a Transforming Organization : The Case of The Estonian Police|journal=The Journal of Power Institutions in Post-Soviet Societies|year=2006|volume=4/5|url=http://pipss.revues.org/502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourthly, certain security roles might for cultural reasons only be able to be performed by personnel of a particular gender, requiring both male and female personnel for effective operations. For example, in many cultures it is inappropriate for a male police officer or soldier to search a woman. Likewise, in intelligence-gathering, civilians may only be willing to speak with security sector personnel of a certain gender.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender and Security Sector Reform Toolkit|last=Valasek|first=Kristin|publisher=DCAF, OSCE/ODIHR, UN-INSTRAW|year=2008|isbn=|editor-last=Bastick|editor-first=Megan|series=|place=Geneva|pages=|chapter=Security Sector Reform and Gender|author-link=|editor2-last=Valasek|editor2-first=Kristin|chapterurl=http://www.osce.org/odihr/30655?download=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local ownership===
Local ownership has been recognised as a key pillar in ensuring that SSR is both implemented correctly and sustainable. Local ownership of SSR is characterised by "the reform of security policies, institutions and activities in a given country must be designed, managed and implemented by local actors rather than external actors" and is notably distinct from local support for donor programmes and projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nathan|first=Laurie|title=No ownership, no commitment : a guide to local ownership of security sector reform|year=2007|publisher=University of Birmingham|location=Birmingham|isbn=9780704425644|pages=4|url=http://www.ssrnetwork.net/documents/Publications/No_Ownership_No_Commitment_v2.pdf|edition=2nd rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that security and justice needs vary by gender, it is important to ensure that people of different genders are consulted and involved in an SSR process. In practice, this can be achieved by involving women's groups, youth groups and other organisations that work on gender-related security issues such as human trafficking, gang violence and human rights. Such groups can serve as a crucial bridge between local communities and SSR policymakers, strengthening local ownership through communicating security and justice needs to policymakers and raising awareness of SSR in local communities.

===Oversight and accountability===
Improving oversight and accountability of the security sector can ensure the sustainability of SSR by building trust among the population and by deterring security sector personnel from abusing their power.&lt;ref&gt;For further details, see {{cite book|last=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]|title=OECD Handbook on Security System Reform|year=2008|publisher=OECD DAC|location=Paris|isbn=9789264022287|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/development/the-oecd-dac-handbook-on-security-system-reform_9789264027862-en|chapter=Section 7.1: Democratic Oversight and Accountability|edition=2011 Update|pages=112–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be effective, it is essential that security sector oversight bodies  and accountability mechanisms (parliaments, national human rights institutions, complaints bodies, local security fora etc.) adopt a gendered perspective. This involves both giving particular attention to the different types of violations committed by security sector personnel against people of different genders, and monitoring the quality of services delivered to people of different genders. Involving gender experts, women's groups and other civil society organisations that work on gender issues in oversight bodies and accountability processes is helpful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]|title=OECD Handbook on Security System Reform|year=2008|publisher=OECD DAC|location=Paris|isbn=9789264022287|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/development/the-oecd-dac-handbook-on-security-system-reform_9789264027862-en|edition=2011 Update|page=5|chapter=Section 9: Integrating gender awareness and equality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International frameworks==
Gender and SSR at both national and international levels takes place within a well-elaborated legal framework.&lt;ref&gt;For a near-complete list of international and regional legal instruments, see {{Citation | editor-last = Bastick | editor-first = Megan

===Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) (1979)===

[[CEDAW]] holds states responsible for ending discrimination against women, which it defines in Article 1 as "any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field." States parties agree to do this using measures such as reviewing their national legislation to remove discriminatory laws and to criminalize discrimination against women, creating national tribunals or institutions to eliminate discrimination or by implementing policies.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (1995)===

The [[Beijing Declaration]] and the [[Fourth World Conference on Women#Beijing Platform for Action|Platform for Action]] resulted from the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] and aimed to promote the advancement and empowerment of women. Areas related to SSR include calls on governments to ensure access to free or low-cost legal services, to aim for gender balance in nominations to international, judicial and governmental bodies and to develop comprehensive human rights education programmes for the public, public officials (notably within the police, military, prison system, government, judiciary and all those working in positions related to migration).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/&lt;/ref&gt;

===UNSCR 1325 on Women Peace and Security (2000)===

[[UNSCR 1325]] was a landmark resolution in that it recognised the disproportionate impact of armed conflict on civilian women and children, whether they are targeted (e.g. rape as an instrument of war) or indirectly affected (e.g. forced migration). It also recognised contributions women make to conflict prevention, resolution and post-conflict reconstruction and called for greater inclusion of women in processes related to peace and security. It mandated a policy of gender mainstreaming in all UN peacekeeping operations, which often include support to SSR processes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peacewomen.org/themes_page.php?id=15&amp;subtheme=true&amp;adhoc=88&lt;/ref&gt;

===UNSCR 1820 (2008)===

[[UNSCR 1820]] sought to address the issue of sexual violence against women and girls during conflict by explicitly mandating the participation of women in "all disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration processes, and in justice and security sector reform efforts assisted by the United Nations".&lt;ref&gt;https://undocs.org/S/RES/1820(2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===UNSCRs 1888 and 1889 (2009)===

[[UNSCR 1888]] builds on 1820 by mandating that sexual violence also be addressed in peace processes and calls for the deployment of experts and a Special Representative of Sexual Violence in Conflict. [[UNSCR 1889]] calls for an increased role for women at the top levels of mediation as well as mandating the UN to collect gender-segregated data on all activities related to peace and security.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inclusivesecurity.org/publication/guide-to-un-security-council-resolutions-on-women-peace-and-security/&lt;/ref&gt;

===UNSCR 1960 (2010)===

[[UNSCR 1960]] encourages the inclusion of women in police, civil and military functions during peacekeeping missions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.makeeverywomancount.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1369:united-nations-security-council-resolution-1960-unscr-1960-&amp;catid=51:handouts-a-guides&amp;Itemid=154&lt;/ref&gt;

===UNSCR 2106 (2013)===
[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2106|UNSCR 2106]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; requests relevant UN entities to assist national authorities in addressing sexual violence, with effective participation of women, in SSR and justice sector reform processes, specifically through training, increasing female recruitment and implementing vetting processes that exclude perpetrators of sexual violence from serving in security institutions.&lt;ref&gt;https://undocs.org/S/RES/2106(2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods and strategies==
The following two complementary strategies can be used to integrate gender issues into SSR policy and programming:

===Gender mainstreaming===
[[Gender mainstreaming]] is "the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in all areas and at all levels. It is a strategy for making women's as well as men's concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and societal spheres so that women and men benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated. The ultimate goal is to achieve [[gender equality]]."&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. "[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/docs/52/plenary/a52-3.htm Report of the Economic and Social Council for 1997]". A/52/3.18 September 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of SSR, gender mainstreaming involves considering the impact all aspects of the programme at all stages of the programming cycle in light of the different security needs of women, men, boys and girls. To achieve this, all data collected should be gender disaggregated. It may result in gender initiatives – such as gender training for security sector personnel and gender budget analysis to ensure that resources are being distributed equally: It may also result in initiatives aimed at men, women, boys or girls&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; – such as mentoring schemes to facilitate the professional development of female police officers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carson|first=David|author-link=|date=November 2009|title=Mentoring For Women in Policing in the UK|url=http://business.brookes.ac.uk/commercial/work/iccld/ijebcm/documents/special3-paper-05.pdf|journal=International Journal of Evidence Based Coaching and Mentoring|volume=Special Issue No.3|pages=51–63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing access to justice for male civilian victims of wartime sex-selective massacres,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpenter|first1=R.

===Promoting the equal participation of men and women===
Sometimes known as gender balance, promoting the equal participation of men and women in SSR processes and security sector institutions is a method of strengthening local ownership as well as increasing representation and effectiveness. In relation to SSR processes, this may involve ensuring that women and men are equally involved in SSR needs assessment, monitoring and evaluation, and that representatives of women (such as from the ministry responsible for women, or from civil society) participate in SSR policy- and decision-making. In relation to security sector institutions, because men are over-represented, promoting equal participation generally involves increasing the recruitment, retention and advancement of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harvey|first=D.|title=Gender Advisor to COM KFOR|url=http://www.nato.int/kfor/chronicle/2012/chronicle_09/chronicle_09.pdf|newspaper=KFOR Chronicle|date=September 2012}} There are, however, some areas where numbers of men need to be increased. For example, NATO Gender Advisor Major Elisabeth Schleicher recruited NATO's first male Gender Focal Point, CPT Andy Young, and claims that this has enhanced the effectiveness of the gender unit.&lt;/ref&gt; Doing so may require developing policies for security sector institutions that allow personnel to perform socially-expected gender roles (e.g. flexible working hours for parents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some countries have attempted to promote equal participation by introducing gender quotas. In the Liberian National Police, for example, a quota that at least 20% of new recruits must be women succeeded in rapidly increasing female participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Country contexts==
While all gender and SSR processes share many overarching objectives, the kinds of activities carried out on the ground will vary significantly depending upon the context in which they take place.

===Post-conflict countries===
The focus of many gender and SSR efforts in post-conflict settings is on stemming heightened levels of SGBV, particularly against women and children, that tend to persist due to high levels of available weapons, trauma and a lack of economic opportunities for former-combatants and young adults (especially men) who feel marginalised. Men, women, girls and boys all have important roles to play in re-establishing civil society. However, as there is often pressure to rebuild security sector institutions as quickly as possible and as male-dominated, militarised command structures may still be in political control of the state, the different needs of the population are often overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bastick|first=Megan|title=Integrating Gender in Post-Conflict Security Sector Reform|journal=DCAF Policy Papers|year=2008|issue=29|pages=4–5|url=http://www.dcaf.ch/Publications/Integrating-Gender-in-Post-Conflict-Security-Sector-Reform}}&lt;/ref&gt; Challenges in these settings frequently include integrating gender issues in DDR processes, recruiting more women into newly reconstructed security sector institutions, ensuring access to transitional justice mechanisms for victims of SGBV during the conflict and ensuring that the newly reformed justice institutions take into account the needs of those most at risk from the heightened levels of post-conflict SGBV. However, it should also be emphasised that SSR can be an entry point in post-conflict contexts for overcoming pre-conflict gender-based inequality and insecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bastick|first=Megan|title=Integrating Gender in Post-Conflict Security Sector Reform|journal=DCAF Policy Papers|year=2008|issue=29|pages=16–20|url=http://www.dcaf.ch/Publications/Integrating-Gender-in-Post-Conflict-Security-Sector-Reform}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transitional countries===
Transitional countries refer to post-authoritarian contexts which may or may not be accompanied be changes in economic system. They tend to have well-funded and oversized security institutions that are undergoing a shift from serving a regime to serving the population. As such, developing and implementing new working practices whereby the primary objective is to respond to the different security needs of the population may present a challenge for personnel who are used to maintaining order through violent means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Future of Security Sector Reform|year=2010|publisher=The Centre for International Governance Innovation|location=Waterloo, Ont.|pages=183–186.|author=Alice Hills|editor=Mark Sedra|chapter=Learning the Hard Way: Implementing SSR in Africa's Post-Authoritarian States}}&lt;/ref&gt; In former [[Eastern Bloc]] transitional countries, civil society may be weak but in other contexts such as in countries affected by the [[Arab Spring]], civil society may have organised into a broad coalition in order to bring about political change with women's groups playing a leading role. There often is a window of opportunity for civil society to reshape security sector institutions by, for example, integrating gender perspectives. This may also be incentivised by new possibilities for regional cooperation which involve adhering to gender-related minimum standards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Developing countries===
There is increasing opinion that gender-based violence and discrimination inhibit development as, aside from their negative social and personal consequences, they impair the productivity of those affected to the detriment of the whole economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morrison|first=Andrew R.|title=The costs and impacts of gender-based violence in developing countries: Methodological considerations and new evidence|date=November 2004|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/costsandimpactsofgbv.pdf|author2=Maria Beatriz Orlando}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UN Women|title=Gender-Based Violence and the Workplace: Report of the Expert Group Meeting|date=12–13 December 2011|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/ianwge2012/Executive-Summary-EGM-GBV-Workplace-Feb-21.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gender-based violence and discrimination also increases the risk of violent conflict breaking out as it can be used as an instrument of warfare to destabilise communities, can inhibit certain groups from participating in post-conflict peacebuilding activities as well as perpetuating an atmosphere of impunity regarding violence in the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barr|first=Corey|title=Making Connections: Bridging Transitional Justice and Security Sector Reform to Confront Conflict-Related Sexual and Gender-Based Violence|journal=[[PRAXIS: The Fletcher Journal of Human Security]]|year=2011|volume= XXVI|pages=6, 8, 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, gender and SSR is increasingly being implemented by the governments of developing countries with the support of donors and other actors in the international community, who may make the integration of gender a condition for development support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oelke|first=Sandra|title=Security Sector Reform and Gender: Concept and Points of Entry for Development Cooperation|year=2007|publisher=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) GmbH|location=Eschborn|pages=7|url=http://www2.gtz.de/dokumente/bib/07-0738.pdf}} Translated by Katherine Clark. See also UN Millennium Development Goal 3, http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/gender.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Translating policy into practice is often hindered by the lack of human and financial resources in developing counties. However, civil society organisations are widespread and well-organised in many developing countries providing competent partners for governments and donors in implementing gender and SSR initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mobekk|first=Eirin|title=Gender, Women and Security Sector Reform|journal=International Peacekeeping|date=23 April 2010|volume=17|issue=2|pages=284, 288–9|doi=10.1080/13533311003625142|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13533311003625142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developed countries===
The term SSR is usually used to refer to processes in post-conflict and transitional countries, where there is often support by third countries and/or international organisations.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Concept for European Community Support for Security Sector Reform refers to it as EU "external action"; it does not include justice reform activities in member-states such as Romania and Bulgaria within the scope of its SSR activities. See {{cite journal|last=Commission of the European Communities|title=A Concept for European Community Support for Security Sector Reform|journal=Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament|date=24 May 2006|issue={SEC(2006) 658}|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2006/com2006_0253en01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, developed countries also engage in SSR activities. Gender and SSR-related activities include efforts to increase the recruitment, retention and advancement of female security sector personnel, improving responses to SGBV, training on how to prevent and respond to SGBV during overseas deployments, strengthening the gender dimensions of oversight and monitoring, and building collaboration with civil society groups concerned with gender issues. The challenges for integrating gender in such contexts tend to revolve around complacency and the emphasis on external threats such as terrorism. Entry points for gender and SSR are often linked to legal obligations under anti-discrimination and human rights legislation, or the need to boost recruitment for operational reasons. For example, following the introduction of the Canadian Human Rights Act (1977), the Canadian Forces were obliged to prove that any discriminatory policies were an operational necessity. After consistently failing to do so in court, the systemic barriers to women's participation in all areas of activity had been lifted by 2001. Social pressure also forced the Canadian Forces to address attitudinal causes of discrimination and SGBV through the establishment of Defense Diversity Councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winslow|first=Donna|author2=Jason Dunn|title=Women in the Canadian Forces: Between legal and social integration|journal=Current Sociology|year=2002|volume=50|issue=5|pages=642, 661–2|doi=10.1177/0011392102050005003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, regional frameworks such as NATO and the Council of Europe can provide impetus and a degree of social pressure for gender and SSR activities in developing countries.

The figure at left holds the severed head of the figure at right, who spouts blood in the form of serpents from his neck]]
During the [[pre-Columbian era]], '''human sacrifice in Maya culture''' was the ritual offering of nourishment to the [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|gods]]. Blood was viewed as a potent source of nourishment for the Maya deities, and the [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrifice]] of a living creature was a powerful [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|blood offering]]. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in [[human sacrifice]]. Generally only high status prisoners of [[Maya warfare|war]] were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p751"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 751.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human sacrifice among the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] is evident from at least the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Classic Era|Classic period]] (c.&amp;nbsp;AD&amp;nbsp;250–900) right through to the final stages of the [[Spanish conquest of Petén|Spanish conquest]] in the 17th century. Human sacrifice is depicted in Classic [[Ancient Maya art|Maya art]], is mentioned in Classic period [[Maya script|hieroglyphic texts]] and has been verified archaeologically by analysis of skeletal remains from the Classic and [[Mesoamerican chronology#Postclassic Era|Postclassic]] (c.&amp;nbsp;AD&amp;nbsp;900–1524) periods. Additionally, human sacrifice is described in a number of late Maya and early Spanish colonial texts, including the ''[[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid Codex]]'', the [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] epic ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', the K'iche' ''[[Título de Totonicapán]]'', the [[K'iche' language]] ''[[Rabinal Achi]]'', the ''[[Annals of the Kaqchikels]]'', the [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec]] ''[[Songs of Dzitbalche]]'' and [[Diego de Landa]]'s ''[[Relación de las cosas de Yucatán]]''.

A number of methods were employed by the Maya, the most common being decapitation and heart extraction. Additional forms of sacrifice included ritually shooting the victim with arrows, hurling sacrifices into a deep [[sinkhole]], entombing alive to accompany a noble burial, tying the sacrifice into a ball for a ritual reenactment of the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] and disembowelment.

==Methods==
A variety of methods were used by the ancient Maya to perform human sacrifice, such as:

===Decapitation===
{{Maya civilization}}
Important rituals such as the dedication of major building projects or the enthronement of a new ruler required a human sacrificial offering. The sacrifice of an enemy king was the most prized offering, and such a sacrifice involved decapitation of the captive ruler in a ritual reenactment of the decapitation of the [[Maya maize god]] by the [[Maya death gods]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p751"/&gt; In AD 738, the vassal king [[K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat]] of [[Quiriguá]] captured his overlord, [[Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil]] of [[Copán]] and a few days later he ritually decapitated him;&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp.134–35. Looper 2003, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; such royal sacrifices were often recorded in [[Maya script]] with the "ax event" [[glyph]]. The decapitation of an enemy king may have been performed as part of a ritual [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballgame]] reenacting the victory of the [[Maya Hero Twins]] over the gods of the [[Xibalba|underworld]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p751"/&gt;

Sacrifice by decapitation is depicted in Classic period Maya art, and sometimes took place after the victim was tortured, being variously beaten, scalped, burnt or [[Disembowelment|disembowelled]].&lt;ref name="MillerTaube9303p96"&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, 2003, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Sacrifice by decapitation is depicted on [[relief]]s at [[Chichen Itza]] in two of the [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]] (the Great Ballcourt and the Monjas Ballcourt).&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie 1991, pp. 321–322.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hero Twins myth recounted in the Popol Vuh relates how one of each pair of twins (the Hero Twins themselves and their father and uncle) was decapitated by their ballgame opponents.&lt;ref name="Gillespie91p322-323"&gt;Gillespie 1991, pp. 322–323.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heart removal===
During the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic period]] (c. 900–1524) the most common form of human sacrifice was heart extraction, influenced by the method used by the [[Aztec]]s in the [[Valley of Mexico]];&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p751"/&gt; this usually took place in the courtyard of a temple, or upon the summit of the [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramid-temple]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p752"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 752.&lt;/ref&gt; The sacrifice was stripped and [[Maya Blue|painted blue]], which was the colour representing sacrifice, and was made to wear a peaked headdress.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler2006p752ReadGonzalex2000p139"/&gt;

Four blue-painted attendants representing the four [[Chaac]]s of the cardinal directions stretched the sacrifice out over a convex stone that pushed the victim's chest upwards;&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler2006p752ReadGonzalex2000p139"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 752. Read and Gonzalez 2000, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; An official referred to as a ''nacom'' in [[Diego de Landa|Landa]]'s ''[[Relación de las cosas de Yucatán]]'' used a sacrificial knife made from [[flint]] to cut into the ribs just below the victim's left breast and pull out the still-beating heart.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 752. Wild 2008, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''nacom'' then passed the heart to the officiating priest, or ''chilan'', who smeared blood upon the image of the temple's deity.

Depending upon the exact ritual, sometimes the four Chaacs would throw the corpse down the pyramid steps to the courtyard below, where it would be skinned by assistant priests, except for the hands and feet. The ''chilan'' would then remove his ritual attire and dress himself in the skin of the sacrificial victim before performing a ritual dance that symbolised the rebirth of life. If it was a notably courageous warrior who had been sacrificed, then the corpse would be cut into portions and parts would be [[Cannibalism in pre-Columbian America|eaten]] by attending warriors and other bystanders. The hands and feet were given to the ''chilan'' who, if they had belonged to a war captive, wore the bones as a trophy.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p752"/&gt; Archaeological investigations indicate that heart sacrifice was practised as early as the Classic period.&lt;ref name="TieslerCucina06p493"&gt;Tiesler and Cucina 2006, p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrow sacrifice===
Some rituals involved the sacrifice being killed with bow and arrows. The sacrificial victim was stripped and painted blue and made to wear a peaked cap, in a similar manner to the preparation for heart sacrifice. The victim was bound to a stake during a ritual dance, and blood was drawn from the genitals and smeared onto the image of the presiding deity. A white symbol was painted over the victim's heart, which served as a target for the archers. The dancers then passed in front of the sacrificial victim, shooting arrows in turn at the target until the whole chest was filled with arrows. Sacrifice with bow and arrow is recorded as far back as the Classic Period (c. 250-900), and was depicted with graffiti upon the walls of [[Tikal Temple II]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p752"/&gt; The ''[[Songs of Dzitbalche]]'' are a collection of Yucatec Maya poems written down in the mid-18th century; two poems deal with arrow sacrifice and they are believed to be copies of poems dating to the 15th century, during the Postclassic period.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonson 1982, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; The first, called ''Little Arrow'', is a song calling upon the sacrifice to be brave and take comfort.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonson 1982, pp. 201–202.&lt;/ref&gt; The second is entitled ''Dance of the Archer'' and is a ritual dedicated to the rising sun; it includes instructions to the archer; the archer is instructed upon how to prepare his arrows and to dance three times around the sacrifice. The archer is instructed not to shoot until the second circuit, and to be careful to make sure that the sacrifice dies slowly. On the third circuit, whilst still dancing, the archer is instructed to shoot twice.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonson 1982, pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar scene is described in the [[Annals of the Kaqchikels]], where an important prisoner is bound to a scaffold; the Kaqchikel warriors begin a ritual "blood dance" and proceed to shoot him full of arrows.&lt;ref name="Akkeren99p283"/&gt; In the Late Postclassic [[K'iche' language]] drama ''[[Rabinal Achi]]'', an important war captive is tied to a stake representing the mythological Maize Tree and is sacrificed by being shot with arrows; the text compares the archers to hunters and the sacrifice to game.&lt;ref&gt;van Akkeren 1999, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other methods===
Late Classic graffiti from a structure buried under Group G in Tikal depicts a sacrifice bound to a stake with his hands tied behind his head; the victim was disembowelled.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p753"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 753.&lt;/ref&gt; At the Classic period city of [[Palenque]], a woman in her twenties was entombed alive to accompany a deceased nobleman as a funerary offering.&lt;ref name="MillerTaube9303p97"&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, 2003, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Sacred Cenote]] in Chichen Itza, people were hurled into the [[cenote]] during times of drought, famine or disease. The Sacred Cenote is a naturally occurring [[sinkhole]] eroded from the local [[limestone]]; it is approximately {{convert|50|m|ft}} wide and drops {{convert|20|m|ft}} to the water surface, with the water another {{convert|20|m|ft}} deep. The sides of the cenote are sheer. Human sacrifice was practiced right up until the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]], well after the decline of the city.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p753"/&gt;

At times sacrifices were tightly bound into a ball and were bounced in a ritual reenactment of the ballgame.&lt;ref name="MillerTaube9303p97"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Maya vessel with sacrificial scene DMA 2005-26.jpg|thumb|right|Classic period Maya vessel with a scene of human sacrifice]]

===Classic period (250–900)===
Human sacrifice is depicted in Late Classic artwork and sometimes involved torture; sacrifice was generally via decapitation. At times the sacrificial victim was dressed as a deer. The intended sacrifice may have been publicly displayed and paraded before the act of sacrifice itself. Images of human sacrifice were often sculpted into the steps of [[Maya architecture]] and such stairways may have been the site of periodic sacrifice.&lt;ref name="MillerTaube9303p96"/&gt; Ritual decapitation is well attested from [[Maya script|Maya hieroglyphic texts]] throughout the Classic period.&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Freidel 1991, pp. 311–312n6.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of mass sacrifice during the Classic period has not been recovered archaeologically.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, 2003, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological excavations at a number of sites, including [[Palenque]], [[Calakmul]] and [[Becan]], have uncovered skeletons that bear marks to the vertebrae and ribs consistent with heart extraction at the time of death using a long-bladed flint knife.&lt;ref&gt;Tiesler and Cucina 2006, pp. 493, 501, 503.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Classic period, the sacrifice of companions to accompany high-ranking burials is likely to have been widespread and performed using the heart extraction method, leaving little evidence on skeletal remains. Analysis of those remains that do bear marks suggestive of heart sacrifice indicates that during the Classic period the Maya used a method involving cutting across the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] immediately below the ribcage and cutting the heart free.&lt;ref&gt;Tiesler and Cucina 2006, p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postclassic period (900–1524)===
A Postclassic mass burial in [[Champotón, Campeche|Champotón]] in [[Campeche]], Mexico, included skeletons bearing evidence of violent blows to the sternum that have been interpreted as evidence of heart sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Tiesler and Cucina 2006, p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid Codex]], a Postclassic hieroglyphic Maya book, has an illustration of sacrifice by heart extraction, with the victim stretched over an arched stone.&lt;ref&gt;Vail et al. December 2003, p. S108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj|K'iche']] of highland Guatemala, human sacrifice was performed to the K'iche' gods. Writing at the end of the 17th century, [[Francisco Ximénez]] described the tradition that upon the temple of [[Tohil]], human sacrifices were tied before the representation of the deity, where the priest would open the victim's chest and cut out his heart.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001, pp.356-357.&lt;/ref&gt; After sacrifice, the victim's body was probably hurled down the front stairway of the temple where his head would be severed to be placed on a [[Tzompantli|skull rack]] that was located in front of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001, p.360.&lt;/ref&gt; In the K'iche' epic [[Popol Vuh]], the god Tohil demands his right to suckle from his people, as an infant to its mother, but Tohil suckled upon human blood from the chest of the sacrificial victim.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, 2003, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Popol Vuh'' also describes how the Hero Twin Hunahpu was sacrificed with both the removal of his heart and his head.&lt;ref name="Gillespie91p322-323"/&gt; Human sacrifice was probably also performed to the K'iche' mountain god [[Jacawitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001, pp. 369–370.&lt;/ref&gt; Human sacrifice is also mentioned in the K'iche' document ''[[Título de Totonicapán]]'' ("Title of Totonicapán"). A long passage describing human sacrifice is difficult to interpret but features heart and arrow sacrifice, the flaying of the victim and wearing of his skin in a manner similar to the Aztec rituals associated with their god [[Xipe Totec]], and mention of the sacrificial knife of Tohil.&lt;ref&gt;van Akkeren 1999, pp. 284–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Madrid Codex sacrifice scene p76.jpg|thumb|right|A section of page 76 of the Madrid Codex, depicting sacrifice by heart extraction]]
The [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] Maya, neighbours of the K'iche', also practised human sacrifice. Ample evidence of human sacrifice has been excavated at [[Iximche]], their capital. Human sacrifice is evidenced at the site by the altar upon Structure 2, of a type used in heart sacrifice, and by a cylindrical cache of skulls taken from decapitated victims accompanied by obsidian knives.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p30"&gt;Guillemin 1965, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]] flute crafted from a child's [[femur]] was recovered from one of the temples and is also indicative of human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Guillemín 1965, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; A sacrificial flint knife was also recovered from Structure 3,&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p30"/&gt; and a circular altar at the site is very similar to those used for so-called "[[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|gladiatorial sacrifice]]" by the Aztecs and it may have served this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Guillemín 1965, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Annals of the Kaqchikels]]'' record that around 1491 the rulers of Iximche captured the rulers of the K'iche', as well as the image of Tohil. The captured king and his co-ruler were sacrificed together with the son and grandson of the king, other noblemen and high-ranking warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Mathews 1998, 1999, pp. 295, 297.&lt;/ref&gt; The same text describes how the Kaqchikel captured a powerful lord, called Tolk'om, who was tied to a scaffold and was shot with arrows during a ritual dance.&lt;ref name="Akkeren99p283"&gt;van Akkeren 1999, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human sacrifice during the Spanish conquest (1511–1697)===
In 1511 the Spanish caravel ''Santa María de la Barca'' set sail along the Central American coast to [[Santo Domingo]] from [[Darién Province|Darien]] under the command of [[Pedro de Valdivia (captain of the Santa María de la Barca)|Pedro de Valdivia]].&lt;ref name="deDíosGonzález08p25GómezMartínJune13p56"&gt;de Díos González 2008, p. 25. Gómez Martín June 2013, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was wrecked upon a reef somewhere off [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref name="deDíosGonzález08p25GómezMartínJune13p56"/&gt; There were just twenty survivors from the wreck, including Captain Valdivia, [[Gerónimo de Aguilar]] and [[Gonzalo Guerrero]].&lt;ref&gt;de Díos González 2008, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The survivors set themselves adrift in one of the ship's boats, with bad oars and no sail; after thirteen days during which half of the survivors died, they made landfall upon the coast of Yucatán.&lt;ref name="deDíosGonzález08p25GómezMartínJune13p56"/&gt; There they were seized by the Maya Lord Halach Uinik.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Halach Uinik is actually a title rather than a personal name, meaning "real man" and referring to the ruler of a province. Clendinnen 2003, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Valdivia was sacrificed with four of his companions, and their flesh was served at a feast. The other prisoners were fattened for killing, although Aguilar and Guerrero managed to escape.&lt;ref&gt;de Díos González 2008, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the disastrous Spanish-led assault on [[Uspantán]] in 1529, captives taken by the [[Uspantek people|Uspanteks]] were sacrificed to Exbalamquen, one of the Hero Twins.&lt;ref&gt;Lovell 2005, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1555 the [[Acala Ch'ol|Acala]] and their [[Lakandon Ch'ol|Lacandon]] allies killed the Spanish friar [[Domingo de Vico]].&lt;ref&gt;Caso Barrera and Aliphat 2007, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; De Vico, who had established a small missionary church in San Marcos (in [[Alta Verapaz]], Guatemala), had offended a local Maya ruler;&lt;ref&gt;Salazar 1620 2000, pp. 38, 52. ITMB 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; the indigenous leader shot the friar through the throat with an arrow; the angry natives then sacrificed him by cutting open his chest and extracting his heart. His corpse was then decapitated;&lt;ref&gt;Salazar 1620, 2000, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; the natives carried off his head as a trophy, which was never recovered by the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Salazar 1620, 2000, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1620s a Spanish party received permission to visit the still independent [[Itza people|Itza]] capital at [[Nojpetén]], headed by friar Diego Delgado who was accompanied by 13 Spanish soldiers and 80 Christianised Maya guides from [[Tipu, Belize|Tipu]], now in [[Belize]]. The party was seized when they arrived at Nojpetén and sacrificed with their hearts cut out. They were then decapitated and their heads displayed on stakes around the city; Delgado was dismembered.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 774. Means 1917, pp. 79-81. Jones 1998, pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; The main Spanish party was ambushed at Sakalum in January 1624 and slaughtered. The Spanish Captain Francisco de Mirones and a Franciscan priest were sacrificed using the heart extraction method after being bound to the forked posts of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 774. Jones 1998, p. 48. Thompson 1977, 2014, loc. 857.&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the Spanish party were also sacrificed, and their bodies impaled on stakes at the village entrance.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1977, 2014, loc. 857.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1684 three [[Franciscan]] friars were killed, probably by heart sacrifice, at the [[Manche Ch'ol]] settlement of Paliac on the Caribbean coast of Belize. They included Francisco Custodio, Marcos de Muros, and an unnamed lay brother.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1988, p. 35. Bracamonte y Sosa 2001, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of additional Spanish missionaries were sacrificed at Nojpetén. In February 1696 Franciscan friar Juan de San Buenaventura and an unspecified Franciscan companion were taken to Nojpetén during a skirmish between the Yucatec Spanish and the Itza on the west shore of Lake Petén Itzá. The Itza high priest AjKin Kan Ek' later related that he had the Franciscans bound in the form of crosses and then cut out their hearts.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1998, pp. 227–228, 303.&lt;/ref&gt; About a month later a Guatemalan Spanish expedition was ambushed and slaughtered; [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas were taken across to the island of Nojpetén and were similarly bound to X-shaped crosses before having their hearts cut out.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1998, pp. 233, 479n59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congressional '''International Religious Freedom (IRF) Caucus''' is a bi-partisan group of nearly 60 members of the [[United States Congress]] who address religious persecution for people of any or no faith based on Article 18 of the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]].  The IRF Caucus has always addressed [[religious freedom]] within the broader context of [[human rights]] in the spirit of the [[International Religious Freedom Act of 1998]] (IRFA). The Caucus plays a critical role in raising the profile of numerous [[religious freedom]] issues in Congress and with both the Bush and Obama Administrations, and led to the release of many individuals imprisoned for their faith and ensures relief for many suffering under religious persecution.&lt;ref name="The Becket Fund" group="The Becket Fund"&gt;{{cite web|last=The Becket Fund|title=Biography of Tina Ramirez|url=http://www.becketfund.org/author/TinaRamirez/|publisher=The Becket Fund|accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The IRF Caucus was established on the belief that, by ensuring that Congress proactively promotes greater respect for religious freedom in American policy with foreign governments, individuals throughout the world would experience greater freedom and dignity with respect to other rights that closely intertwine with the freedom of religion.  Indeed, states that actively ensure the freedom of religion benefit from greater political stability, economic prosperity, and social harmony, and in turn create greater international peace.

Established in 2006 by [[bipartisan]] co-founders [[Trent Franks]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from [[Arizona]], and [[Emanuel Cleaver, II]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Missouri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/arena/bio/rep_trent_franks.html|accessdate=26 March 2012|newspaper=POLITICO}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Caucus has worked to ensure that this freedom, which was so foundational to America's democratic history, remains a priority in United States foreign policy, development, and refugee law. With nearly 60 members, the Caucus enjoys broad bipartisan and multi-faith support as it highlights ways to ensure greater respect for an individual's freedom of religious belief throughout the world.  In doing so, the Caucus utilizes international standards as a basis for defining an individual's right to freedom of religious belief, including Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states:

Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.

The Caucus has been an important vehicle for the coordination of religious freedom advocacy in Congress, enabling Members to learn about and become more involved in engaging on this important issue. Over the coming months, we will continue to coordinate any issues members are interested in by hosting briefings, raising cases, coordinating sign-on letters, and discussing strategies for influencing greater respect for religious freedom in US foreign policy.

In the past, the Caucus has held several public hearings on the religious freedom situation in countries such as Bahrain, Bangladesh, Burma, China, Egypt, India, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, North Korea, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Turkey, and Vietnam.  In addition, the Caucus has raised dozens of specific cases of persecution in urgent need of attention with foreign governments.  Most recently, the Caucus coordinated efforts to secure the release of individuals imprisoned for their faith or human rights activities, including Sayed Mussa in Afghanistan and Kareem Abdul Soleiman Amer in Egypt, the safety and asylum of persecuted individuals, and the defeat of the "defamation of religions" resolution at the United Nations.

== Leadership ==
The co-chairs for the International Religious Freedom Caucus are [[Trent Franks]], a Republican from [[Arizona]], and [[Heath Shuler]], a Democrat from [[North Carolina]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2062">The '''Jewish poll tax''' ({{lang-pl|poglówne żydowskie}}) was a [[poll tax]] imposed on the [[Jews]] in [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. It was later absorbed into the ''[[hiberna]]'' tax. &lt;ref name=scep&gt;''Scepter of Judah: The Jewish Autonomy in the Eighteenth-Century Crown Poland'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=1fGQfpMdp84C&amp;pg=PA15 pp. 15-16]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=camb&gt;The Cambridge Dictionary of Judaism and Jewish Culture, p. 118 ([https://www.scribd.com/document/245942663/The-Cambridge-Dictionary-of-Judaism-and-Jewish-Culture browse for "skhumot" online])&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jews were exempt from other state and municipal taxes, which often caused protests from Polish city dwellers.&lt;ref name=scep/&gt;

Initially the collection of the tax was a duty of Jewish Councils ([[Council of Four Lands]], [[Council of the Land of Lithuania]]). Sometimes it was paid to the royal treasury, other times in was paid directly to the military units funded from this tax.&lt;ref name=camb/&gt;

The Jewish councils divide the tax into smaller internal divisions called "portions" (Hebrew: ''skhumot'', Polish: ''sympla'').&lt;ref name=scep/&gt;&lt;ref name=camb/&gt; The sum of the portions was always larger than the state-imposed amount, and the council used the surplus for the needs of Jewish community and the council apparatus. This practice was common for non-Jewish taxes as well,  and the Crown was aware of it.&lt;ref name=scep/&gt;

By early 17th century the duty of Jewish poll tax was transferred to ''[[sejmik]]s'', later to Polish military, and by mid-17th century it was absorbed into the ''hiberna''.&lt;ref name=scep/&gt;

==Definition==
===Theravada===
Bhikkhu Bodhi states:
:There are two kinds of life faculty, the mental, which vitalizes the associated mental states, and the physical, which vitalizes material phenomena. The mental life faculty alone is intended as a cetasika. It has the characteristic of maintaining the associated mental states, the function of making them occur, manifestation as the establishing of their presence, and its proximate cause is the mental states to be maintained. {{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2222-2224}}

===Mahayana===
Within the Mahayana Buddhist teachings, there are a variety of definitions for ''jīvitindriya''. The ''Dharmaskandhapadashastra'' (an early [[Abhidharma]] work of the Sarvastivadin school) defines ''jīvitindriya'' as: a faculty that persists, continues, maintains, animates, and operates what we called sentient beings.&lt;ref&gt;Soonil Hwang (2006), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Jīvitaṃ means “life”, and [[indriya]] means “controlling faculty”.

{{New Thought beliefs}}

In the [[New Thought]] philosophy, the '''Law of Attraction''' is the belief that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts, people can bring positive or negative experiences into their life.&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;Whittaker, S. [http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=78fc94dd-c0b2-4ade-891d-98770bfae388&amp;k=70777 Secret attraction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090328/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=78fc94dd-c0b2-4ade-891d-98770bfae388&amp;k=70777 |date=2016-03-04 }}, ''The Montreal Gazette'', May 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redden, Guy, "Magic Happens: A New Age Metaphysical Mystery Tour", ''Journal of Australian Studies'': 101&lt;/ref&gt; The belief is based on the idea that people and their thoughts are both made from pure energy, and that through the process of like energy attracting like energy a person can improve their own health, wealth, and personal relationships.

The [https://realpsychicnow.biz/ways-to-attract-abundance-and-prosperity-in-your-life/ Law of Attraction] is among the most popular of the Universal Laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ellison|first1=A|title=Metaphysics and Universal Laws|url=http://mysticculture.com/metaphysics-and-universal-laws/|website=Mystic Culture|publisher=Mystic Culture|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of this mind-power paradigm generally combine [[Cognitive reframing|cognitive reframing techniques]] with affirmations and [[creative visualization]] to replace limiting or self-destructive ("negative") thoughts with more empowered, adaptive ("positive") thoughts. A key component of the philosophy is that in order to effectively change one's negative thinking patterns, one must also "feel" (through creative visualization) that the desired changes have already occurred. This combination of positive thought and positive emotion is believed to allow one to attract positive experiences and opportunities by achieving resonance with the proposed energetic law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelawofattraction.com/what-is-the-law-of-attraction/|title=What Is The Law Of Attraction|last1=Hurst|first1=Katherine|date=|website=The Law Of Attraction|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[New Thought]] movement (Law of Attraction Origins) grew out of the teachings of [[Phineas Quimby]] in the early 19th century. Early in his life, Quimby was diagnosed with tuberculosis. However, medicinal treatment wasn't working, so he began carriage riding through his hometown, Lebanon, New Hampshire. He then regained his health and recovered, an event that prompted his study of "mind over body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hughes|first1=n|title=Phineas Parkhurst Quimby|url=http://phineasquimby.wwwhubs.com/|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he never used the words 'Law of Attraction', he explained this in a statement that captured the concept in the field of health: {{quote|the trouble is in the mind, for the body is only the house for the mind to dwell in, and we put a value on it according to its worth. Therefore if your mind has been deceived by some invisible enemy into a belief, you have put it into the form of a disease, with or without your knowledge. By my theory or truth, I come in contact with your enemy and restore you to your health and happiness. This I do partly mentally and partly by talking till I correct the wrong impressions and establish the Truth, and the Truth is the cure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Quimby Manuscripts|url=http://newthoughtlibrary.com/quimbyPhineas/manuscripts/pages/quimby-manuscripts-194.htm|publisher=New Thought library|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In 1877, the term 'Law of Attraction' appeared in print for the first time in a book written by the Russian occultist [[Helena Blavatsky]], in a context alluding to an attractive power existing between elements of spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isis Unveiled|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/isis/iu1-10.htm|publisher=Theosophical University Press, page 340|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Her book ''Isis Unveiled'' discusses esoteric mysteries of ancient theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blavatsky|first1=Helena|title=Isis Unveiled|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/isis/iu-hp.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

But the one who really first articulated the Law as general principle was [[Prentice Mulford]]. Mulford, a pivotal figure in the development of New Thought thinking, discusses the Law of Attraction at length in, for example, his essay "The Law of Success",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Forces and How to Use  Them, Vol. 1|url=https://archive.org/stream/yourforcesandho09mulfgoog#page/n66/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; published 1886-1887. In this, Mulford was followed by other New Thought authors, such as Henry Wood (starting with his ''God’s Image in Man'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=God's Image in Man, Ch. 6, "The Universality of Law"|url=https://archive.org/stream/godsimageinmans01woodgoog#page/n134/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1892), and [[Ralph Waldo Trine]] (starting with his first book, ''What All the World's A-Seeking'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What All the World's A-Seeking|url=https://archive.org/details/whatallworldsas00tringoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1896). For these authors, the Law of Attraction is concerned not only about health but every aspect of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Tune With The Infinite|url=http://newthoughtlibrary.com/trineRalphWaldo/inTune/pages/in-tune-with-the-infinite-026.htm#TopOfText|publisher=New Thought Library|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE GOD IN YOU|url=http://prenticemulford.wwwhubs.com/tgiy.htm|publisher=Cornerstone Publishing, 2001|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th century saw a surge in interest in the subject with many books being written about it, amongst which are two of the [[List of best-selling books|best-selling books]] of all time; [[Think and Grow Rich]] (1937) by [[Napoleon Hill]] and [[You Can Heal Your Life]] (1984) by [[Louise Hay]].

Even if the [[New Age|New Age movement]] adopted many New Thought ideas, including that of the Law of Attraction, the Law of Attraction remains a new thought philosophical concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Company Aims to Put Good Karma and Energy Close at Hand|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/29/us/seeking-good-karma-a-company-aims-to-put-it-close-at-hand.html?_r=0|publisher=The New York Times, 28 March 2014|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the concept of the Law of Attraction gained a lot of renewed exposure with the release of the film ''[[The Secret (2006 film)|The Secret]]'' (2006) which was then developed into a book of the same title in 2007. The movie and book gained widespread media coverage.&lt;ref name=gazette /&gt;&lt;ref name=oprah1&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oprah.com/spirit/The-Law-of-Attraction-Real-Life-Stories_1 |title=The Law of Attraction: Real-Life Stories - Oprah.com |work=oprah.com |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oprah2&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oprah.com/spirit/Go-Beyond-The-Secret_1 |title=Go Beyond 'The Secret' - Oprah.com |work=oprah.com |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rhonda Byrne]]'s book also has influenced the creation of an untitled fiction film based on The Secret, starring Katie Holmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelawofattraction.com/the-secret-movie/|title=The Secret Movie (2018) Based on The Secret by Rhonda Byrne|date=2017-09-08|work=The Law Of Attraction|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a sequel, [[The Power (self-help book)|The Power]] in 2010 that talks about the law of attraction being the law of love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/power-author-rhonda-byrnes-book/story?id=11421349|title=The Secret Is Out: Megahit Writer Says Power of Love Will Fill Your Bank Account|last=NANCE-NASH|first=SHERYL|date=August 18, 2010|work=ABC News|access-date=August 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptions==
New Thought authors believe that the Law of Attraction is always in operation and that it brings to each person the conditions and experiences that they predominantly think about, or which they desire or expect.

[[Charles F. Haanel|Charles Haanel]] wrote in ''[[The Master Key System]]'' (1912):
{{quote|The law of attraction will certainly and unerringly bring to you the conditions, environment, and experiences in life, corresponding with your habitual, characteristic, predominant mental attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Master Key System. Chapter 8, part 18.|url=http://newthoughtlibrary.com/haanel-charles/Master-Key-System/audioEbook/master-key-systemRAW.pdf|publisher=New Thought Library|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Ralph Trine wrote in ''In Tune With The Infinite'' (1897):
{{quote|The law of attraction works universally on every plane of action, and we attract whatever we desire or expect. If we desire one thing and expect another, we become like houses divided against themselves, which are quickly brought to desolation. Determine resolutely to expect only what you desire, then you will attract only what you wish for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Tune With The Infinite, by Ralph Trine|url=http://newthoughtlibrary.com/trineRalphWaldo/inTune/pages/in-tune-with-the-infinite-035.htm#TopOfText|publisher=New Thought Library|accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Rhonda Byrne published in 2006 the film [[The Secret (2006 film)|The Secret]] wherein she emphasized thinking about what each person wants to obtain, but also to infuse the thought with the maximum possible amount of emotion. She claims the combination of thought and feeling is what attracts the desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tameyourmind.org/articles/how-can-it-possibly-be-law-attraction-works|title=How can it possibly be that the law of attraction works?|last=Henry|first=Juliette|date=|website=www.tameyourmind.org|publisher=Transformation guide|access-date=3 Dec 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secret says your subconscious mind can control everything that happens around you, including both positive experiences, like having someone call you from miles away, and negative experiences, like death. The Byrne underlines the power of the subconscious mind by asking the reader to take full control of these thoughts, in order to achieve things in life, with the mind, as much as with action. Another similar book is [[James Redfield]]'s ''[[The Celestine Prophecy]]'', which says reality can be manifested by man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Redfield|first1=James|title=The Celestine Prophecy: An Adventure|date=1993|publisher=Warner Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Man and the universe have a force of attraction between them similar to a magnetic attraction. ''The Power of Your Subconscious Mind'' by Joseph Murphy, says readers can achieve seemingly impossible goals by learning how to bring the mind itself under control. ''The Power'' by Rhonda Byrne, ''The Alchemist'' by Paulo Coelho, and ''The Power of Now'' by Eckhart Tolle are similar. While personal testimonies claim the secret and the law to have worked for them, a number of skeptics have criticized Rhonda Byrne's film and book. ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' called the secret pseudoscience and an "illusion of knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chabris|first1=Christopher F.|last2=Simons|first2=Daniel J.|title=The Pseudoscience of ‘The Secret’ and ‘The Power’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/books/review/Chabris-t.html|accessdate=2017-08-13|work=The New York Times|date=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical and religious basis==
The New Thought concept of the Law of Attraction is rooted in ideas that come from various philosophical and religious traditions.  In particular, it has been inspired by [[Hermeticism]], [[New England transcendentalism]], specific verses from the [[Bible]], and [[Hinduism]],

Hermeticism influenced the development of European thought in the [[Renaissance]]. Its ideas were transmitted partly through [[alchemy]]. In the 18th century, [[Franz Mesmer]] studied the works of alchemists such as [[Paracelsus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Aoust|first1=Maja|title=The Secret Source|date=2012|publisher=Process|isbn=978-1-934170-32-8|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jan Baptist van Helmont|van Helmont]].&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt; Van Helmont was a 17th-century [[Flemish people|Flemish]] physician who proclaimed the curative powers of the imagination.&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hedesan|first1=Georgiana D.|title=Paracelsian Medicine and Theory of Generation in ‘Exterior homo’, a Manuscript Probably Authored by Jan Baptist Van Helmont (1579–1644), ref 52|journal=Medical History|date=July 2014|volume=58|issue=03|pmc=4103403|pmid=25045180|doi=10.1017/mdh.2014.29|pages=375–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hedesan|first1=Delia Georgiana|title=‘Christian Philosophy’: Medical Alchemy and Christian Thought in the Work of Jan Baptista Van Helmont (1579-1644)|date=2012|page= 31|url=https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10036/4083/HedesanD.pdf?sequence=4|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lead Mesmer to develop his ideas about [[Animal magnetism]] which [[Phineas Quimby]], the founder of New Thought, studied.&lt;ref name=Hist&gt;{{cite web|last1=Braden|first1=Charles S.|title=A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE NEW THOUGHT MOVEMENT.(1963)|url=http://www.surrenderworks.com/library/downloads/braden.pdf|publisher=surrenderworks.com|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PHINEAS PARKHURST QUIMBY 1802 - 1866 Father of New Thought|url=http://phineasquimby.wwwhubs.com/|publisher=phineasquimby|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Transcendentalist movement developed in the United States immediately before the emergence of New Thought and is thought to have had a great influence on it. [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]], an important figure in that movement, stated that its leading idea was "the supremacy of mind over matter".&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mikics|first1=David|title=The Annotated Emerson|date=2012|publisher=Belknap Press|isbn=978-0674049239|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nI3uBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=%22george+ripley%22+%22the+supremacy+of+mind+over+matter%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F4dN_3p4mO&amp;sig=kr_BiWEHcVDvCHTbSaxHUW6apJI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAWoVChMInfvbtLacyQIVim8UCh0YTg1T#v=onepage&amp;q=%22george%20ripley%22%20%22the%20supremacy%20of%20mind%20over%20matter%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Thought authors often quote certain verses from the Bible in the context of the Law of Attraction. An example is [[Mark 11]]:24: "Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark 11:24|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+11%3A24&amp;version=RSV|publisher=Bible Gateway|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Master Key System, by Charles Haanel (1912).

In the late 19th century [[Swami Vivekananda]] traveled to the United States and gave lectures on [[Hinduism]]. These talks greatly influenced the New Thought movement and in particular, [[William Walker Atkinson]] who was one of New Thought's pioneers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Aoust|first1=Maja|title=The Secret Source|date=2012|publisher=Process|isbn=978-1-934170-32-8|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodroffe|first1=John|title=Shakti and Shâkta, Chapter 24, 12th paragraph|date=1918|publisher=Luzac &amp; Co|isbn=978-1595479204|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/tantra/sas/sas24.htm|

==Criticism==
''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' magazine criticized the lack of [[falsifiability]] and [[testability]] of these claims.&lt;ref name="csicop.org"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mary Carmichael |author2=Ben Radford |url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/secrets_and_lies/ |title=CSI &amp;#124; Secrets and Lies |publisher=Csicop.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have asserted that the evidence provided is usually [[anecdotal]] and that, because of the [[publication bias|self-selecting nature of the positive reports]], as well as the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] nature of any results, these reports are susceptible to [[confirmation bias]] and [[selection bias]].&lt;ref name="Kaptchuck"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kaptchuk, T., &amp; Eisenberg, D. |year=1998 |title=The Persuasive Appeal of Alternative Medicine |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=129 |issue=12 |pmid=9867762 |pages=1061–5 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-129-12-199812150-00011|last2=Eisenberg }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist [[Ali Alousi]], for instance, criticized it as unmeasurable and questioned the likelihood that thoughts can affect anything outside the head.&lt;ref name=gazette/&gt;

The Law of Attraction has been popularized in the early 21st century by books and films such as ''[[The Secret (book)|The Secret]]''. This 2006 film and the subsequent book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Secret |year=2006 |first=Rhonda |last=Byrne |publisher=Beyond Words Publishing |isbn=978-1-58270-170-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; use interviews with New Thought authors and speakers to explain the principles of the proposed metaphysical law that one can attract anything that one thinks about consistently. Writing for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, [[Mary Carmichael]] and [[Ben Radford]] wrote that "neither the film nor the book has any basis in scientific reality", and that its premise contains "an ugly flipside: if you have an accident or disease, it's your fault".&lt;ref name="csicop.org"/&gt;

Others have questioned the references to modern scientific theory, and have maintained, for example, that the Law of Attraction misrepresents the electrical activity of [[Neural oscillation|brainwaves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Scientific American |date=June 2007 |volume=296 |issue=6 |pages=39–39 |title=The (Other) Secret |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-other-secret |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0607-39|last1=Shermer |first1=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Stenger]] and [[Leon Lederman]] are critical of attempts to use [[quantum mysticism]] to bridge any unexplained or seemingly implausible effects, believing these to be traits of modern [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stenger |first=Victor J. |title=Cosmic Mind |url=http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Quantum/01CosmicMind.pdf |publisher=University of Colorado |authorlink=Victor_Stenger |pages=8–19 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924013317/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Quantum/01CosmicMind.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leon Lederman 1993 189–198"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt;

==Prominent supporters==

* In 1891 Californian author and humorist [[Prentice Mulford]] used the term Law of Attraction in his essays ''Some Laws of Health and Beauty'' and ''Good And Ill Effects of Thought''.
* In 1897 [[Ralph Waldo Trine]] wrote ''In Tune with the Infinite''. In the second paragraph of chapter 9 he writes, "The Law of Attraction works unceasingly throughout the universe, and the one great and never changing fact in connection with it is, as we have found, that like attracts like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trine|first1=Ralph|title=In Tune With The Infinite|publisher=G Bell and Sons, LTD.  Published 1911|location=London|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thomas Troward]], a strong influence in the New Thought Movement, gave a 1904 lecture in which he claimed that thought precedes physical form and "the action of Mind plants that nucleus which, if allowed to grow undisturbed, will eventually attract to itself all the conditions necessary for its manifestation in outward visible form."&lt;ref&gt;Judge Thomas Troward, ''The Edinburgh Lectures on Mental Science'', 1904.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1902 English New Thought writer [[James Allen (author)|James Allen]] (best known for writing ''[[As a Man Thinketh]]'') wrote a series of books and articles between 1901 and 1912, after which his wife [[Lily L. Allen|Lily]] continued his work.
* [[Emmet Fox]] wrote about metaphysics and the power of prayer in essays and books. His teachings are founded in Christianity and bible stories. He cites Jesus Christ as being the greatest teacher of metaphysics who ever lived and explains that thoughts are our most important emanation, more important than what we say or what we do. In the books ''Power Through Constructive Thinking'' and ''Find and Use your Inner Power'' Fox speaks about "building the mental equivalent of what you want and to expunge those that you don't".
* In his New Thought Movement book [[William Walker Atkinson]] used the phrase ''Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World'' (1906), stating that "like attracts like".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gitacademy.tripod.com/GodsInTraining/ThoughtVibration.htm William Walker Atkinson. ''Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction''. Advanced Thought Publishing. 1906.] Out of Copyright version&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bruce MacLelland]]'s ''Prosperity Through Thought Force'' (1907), a [[prosperity theology]] book, summarizes the principle as "You are what you think, not what you think you are." It was published by [[Elizabeth Towne]], the editor of ''[[The Nautilus (magazine)|The Nautilus Magazine, a Journal of New Thought]]''.&lt;ref name="maclelland"&gt;MacLelland, Bruce, ''Prosperity Through Thought Force,'' Elizabeth Towne, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his 1910 ''The Science of Getting Rich'' [[Wallace D. Wattles]] espoused similar principles — that simply believing in the object of your desire and focusing on it will lead to that object or goal being realized on the material plane (Wattles claims in the Preface and later chapters of this book that his premise stems from the [[monistic]] [[Hindu]] view that God provides everything and can deliver what we focus on). The book also claims negative thinking will manifest negative results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Science_of_Getting_Rich |title=The Science of Getting Rich - Wikisource |publisher=En.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] author [[William Quan Judge]] used the phrase in ''The Ocean of Theosophy'' (1915).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Judge | first = William Quan |title = The Ocean of Theosophy |publisher =United Lodge of Theosophists |year= 1915 | page = 103|isbn= 0-7661-0544-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another theosophical author [[Annie Besant]] discussed the 'Law of Attraction' in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POPULAR LECTURES ON THEOSOPHY|url=http://www.anandgholap.net/Popular_Lectures_On_Theosophy-AB.htm|publisher=anandgholap|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besant compared her version of it to [[gravitation]], and said that the law represented a form of [[karma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karma|url=http://www.anandgholap.net/Karma-AB.htm|publisher= Theosophical Publishing House|accessdate=16 May 2012|author=Annie Besant|year=1895|edition= First}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Napoleon Hill]] published two books on the theme. The first, ''[[The Law of Success|The Law of Success in 16 Lessons]]'' (1928), directly and repeatedly references the Law of Attraction and proposes that it operates by use of radio waves transmitted by the brain. The second, ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'' (1937), went on to sell 100 million copies by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Think and Grow Rich |url=http://www.naphill.org/shop/books/think-and-grow-rich/ |date=2015 |publisher=Napoleon Hill Foundation |accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill insisted on the importance of controlling one's own thoughts in order to achieve success, as well as the energy that thoughts have and their ability to attract other thoughts. He mentions a "secret" to success and promises to indirectly describe it at least once in every chapter. It is never named and he says that discovering it on one's own is far more beneficial. Many people have argued over what it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why The Law of Attraction has been a Secret|url=http://www.law-of-attraction.com/131/law-of-attraction-has-been-a-secret/|publisher=Positive Inspiration|access-date=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; actually is, some claim it's the Law of Attraction. Hill states the "secret" is mentioned no fewer than a hundred times, yet reference to "attract" is used less than 30 times in the text. He further claims that people can obtain what they desire through thought of definite purpose.{{sfn|Hill|2010|pp=23-24}}
* [[Israel Regardie]] published books with the Law of Attraction theme as one of his prevailing Universal Laws. In, ''The Art of True Healing: A Treatise on the Mechanism of Prayer and the Operation of the Law of Attraction in Nature'' (1937), he taught a focused meditation technique to help the mind to learn to heal itself on a physical and spiritual level. Regardie claimed that the Law of Attraction was a valid method for attracting good physical health and for improvement in any aspect of one's life.&lt;ref name="Regardie 1974 p.

In [[mathematics]], particularly [[topology]], a [[topological space]] ''X'' is '''locally normal''' if intuitively it looks locally like a [[normal space]]. More precisely, a locally normal space satisfies the property that each point of the space belongs to a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of the space that is normal under the [[subspace topology]]. 

==Formal definition==

A [[topological space]] ''X'' is said to be '''locally normal''' [[if and only if]] each point, ''x'', of ''X'' has a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] that is [[normal space|normal]] under the [[subspace topology]].

Note that not every neighbourhood of ''x'' has to be normal, but at least one neighbourhood of ''x'' has to be normal (under the subspace topology).

Note however, that if a space were called locally normal [[if and only if]] each point of the space belonged to a subset of the space that was normal under the subspace topology, then every topological space would be locally normal. This is because, the singleton {''x''} is [[Vacuous truth|vacuously]] normal and contains ''x''. Therefore, the definition is more restrictive.

==Examples and properties==

* Every locally normal [[T1 space]] is [[Locally regular space|locally regular]] and [[Locally Hausdorff space|locally Hausdorff]].
* A [[Locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] is always locally normal.
* A normal space is always locally normal.
* A [[T1 space]] need not be locally normal as the set of all real numbers endowed with the [[cofinite topology]] shows.

==Theorems==

'''Theorem 1'''

If ''X'' is [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to ''Y'' and ''X'' is locally normal, then so is ''Y''.

'''Proof'''

This follows from the fact that the image of a normal space under a homeomorphism is always normal.

In [[Irish mythology]], '''Mag Mell''' (modern spelling: '''Magh Meall''', meaning "plain of joy") was a mythical realm achievable through death and/or glory. Unlike the [[underworld]] in some mythologies, Mag Mell was a pleasurable paradise, identified as either an island far to the west of Ireland or a kingdom beneath the ocean. However, Mag Mell was similar to the fields of [[Elysium]] in Greek mythology, and like the fields of Elysium, was accessible only to a select few. Furthermore, Mag Mell, like the numerous other mystical islands said to be off the coast of Ireland, was never explicitly stated in any surviving mythological account to be an afterlife. Rather, it is usually portrayed as a paradisal location populated by deities, which is occasionally visited by some adventurous mortals. In its island guise it was visited by various Irish heroes and monks forming the basis of the Adventure Myth or "[[echtrae]]" as defined by [[Myles Dillon]] in his book ''Early Irish Literature''. This otherworld is a place where sickness and death do not exist.  It is a place of eternal youth and beauty.  Here, music, strength, life and all pleasurable pursuits come together in a single place.  Here happiness lasts forever, no one wants for food or drink.  It is the Irish equivalent of the Greek [[Elysium]] or the [[Valhalla]] of the Norse.

Legends say its ruler is the [[Fomorians|Fomorian]] King [[Tethra]], or more frequently [[Manannan mac Lir]]. Mag Mell's allure extended from the pagan era to Christian times. In later stories, the realm is less an afterlife destination than an [[Earthly Paradise]] which adventurers could reach by traveling west from [[Ireland]], often blown off course by providential tempests while on an inspired mission. They typically explore many other fantastic islands before reaching their destination and returning home (or sailing on). Among these voyagers are [[St. Brendan]], [[Bran mac Febal]] (see ''[[The Voyage of Bran]]''), and [[Mael Dúin]].

[[File:Assessment and treatment algorithm for overweight and obesity.png|thumb|450px|A medical algorithm for assessment and treatment of [[overweight]] and [[obesity]].]]
A '''medical algorithm''' is any [[computation]], [[formula]], [[statistical survey]], [[nomogram]], or [[look-up table]], useful in [[healthcare]].  [[Medical]] [[algorithm]]s include [[decision tree]] approaches to healthcare treatment (e.g., if [[symptom]]s A, B, and C are evident, then use treatment X) and also less clear-cut tools aimed at reducing or defining uncertainty.

==Scope==
Medical algorithms are part of a broader field which is usually fit under the aims of [[medical informatics]] and medical [[decision-making]]. Medical decisions occur in several areas of medical activity including medical test selection, [[diagnosis]], therapy and [[prognosis]], and [[automatic control]] of [[medical equipment]].

In relation to [[logic]]-based and [[artificial neural network]]-based [[clinical decision support system|clinical decision support systems]], which are also computer applications used in the medical decision-making field, algorithms are less complex in architecture, data structure and user interface. Medical algorithms are not necessarily implemented using digital computers. In fact, many of them can be represented on paper, in the form of diagrams, nomographs, etc.

==Examples==
A wealth of medical information exists in the form of published medical algorithms.  These algorithms range from simple [[calculation]]s to complex outcome [[prediction]]s.  Most [[clinician]]s use only a small subset routinely.

Examples of medical algorithms are:
* [[Calculators]], e.g. an on-line or stand-alone calculator for [[body mass index]] (BMI) when stature and body weight are given;
* [[Flowcharts]], e.g. a binary [[decision tree]] for deciding what is the [[etiology]] of [[chest pain]]
* [[Look-up table]]s, e.g. for looking up [[food energy]] and nutritional contents of foodstuffs
* [[Nomogram]]s, e.g. a moving circular slide to calculate body surface area or drug dosages.

A common class of algorithms are embedded in guidelines on the choice of treatments produced by many national, state, financial and local healthcare organisations and provided as knowledge resources for day to day use and for induction of new physicians. A field which has gained particular attention is the choice of medications for psychiatric conditions. In the United Kingdom, guidelines or algorithms for this have been produced by most of the circa 500 primary care trusts, substantially all of the circa 100 secondary care psychiatric units and many of the circa 10 000 general practices. In the US, there is a national (federal) initiative to provide them for all states, and by 2005 six states were adapting the approach of the [[Texas Medication Algorithm Project]] or otherwise working on their production.

A grammar—the [[Arden syntax]]—exists for describing algorithms in terms of [[medical logic module]]s. An approach such as this should allow exchange of MLMs between doctors and establishments, and enrichment of the common stock of tools.

==Purpose==
The intended purpose of medical algorithms is to improve and standardize decisions made in the delivery of [[medical care]]. Medical algorithms assist in standardizing selection and application of treatment regimens, with algorithm [[automation]] intended to reduce potential introduction of errors.  Some attempt to predict the outcome, for example [[ICU scoring systems|critical care scoring systems]].

Computerized health diagnostics algorithms can provide timely clinical decision support, improve adherence to [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] [[guideline (medical)|guidelines]], and be a resource for education and research. 

Medical algorithms based on best practice can assist everyone involved in delivery of standardized treatment via a wide range of clinical care providers. Many are presented as [[Clinical trial protocol|protocol]]s and it is a key task in training to ensure people step outside the protocol when necessary.  In our present state of knowledge, generating hints and producing guidelines may be less satisfying to the authors, but more appropriate.

==Cautions==
In common with most science and medicine, algorithms whose contents are not wholly available for scrutiny and open to improvement should be regarded with suspicion.

'''National identity''' is a person's identity or sense of belonging to one state or to one [[nation]].&lt;ref name=":24"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Social Identity Theory of Inter-group Behavior |last=Tajfel |first=Henri |date = 1986|journal = Psychology of Intergroup Relations &lt;!-- Please identify correct journal/publication --&gt;|doi = |pmid = |last2=Turner|first2=John C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the sense of a nation as a cohesive whole, as represented by distinctive traditions, culture, language and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/national-identity|title =Definition of National Identity in English|date =|accessdate =|website =Oxford Dictionaries|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =no|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20151117063449/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/national-identity|archivedate =2015-11-17|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; National identity may refer to the subjective feeling one shares with a group of people about a nation, regardless of one's legal citizenship status.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1354-5078.2004.00159.x/abstract|title = Anothony D.

As a collective phenomenon, national identity can arise as a direct result of the presence of elements from the "common points" in people's daily lives: [[national symbol]]s, language, the nation's history, [[national consciousness]], and cultural artefacts.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

The expression of one's national identity seen in a positive light is [[patriotism]] which is characterized by national pride and positive emotion of love for one's country. The extreme expression of national identity is [[chauvinism]], which refers to the firm belief in the country's superiority and extreme loyalty toward one's country.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{cite book|title = Social Identity, Intergroup Conflict, and Conflict Reduction |editor-last=Ashmore |editor-first=Richard D. |editor-last2=Jussim |editor-first2=Lee |editor-last3=Wilder |editor-first3=David |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2001 |isbn=9780195137439 |pages=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation of national identity ==
[[File:Norwegian National Day in Svolvaer.jpg|thumb|Norwegians celebrating national day]]
National identity is not an inborn trait and it is essentially socially constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =Imagined Communities: reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism |last=Anderson|first=Benedict |publisher=Verso |year=1991 |isbn= 9780860915461 |page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person's national identity results directly from the presence of elements from the "common points" in people's daily lives: [[national symbol]]s, [[National language|language]], [[National colours|colors]], nation's history, blood ties, [[culture]], [[music]], cuisine, radio, television, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Tales and National Identity: An introduction to narrative social psychology |last=László |first=János |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=9780415704700 |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title = Patriotism in the Lives of Individuals and Nations|last = Bar-Tal|first = Daniel|publisher = Nelson-Hall Publishers|year = 1997|isbn = 083041410X|location = Chicago|pages = 171–172|last2 = Staub|first2 = Ervin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under various social influences, people incorporate national identity into their personal identities by adopting beliefs, values, assumptions and expectations which align with one’s national identity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; People with identification of their nation view national beliefs and values as personally meaningful, and translate these beliefs and values into daily practices.&lt;ref name=":24"/&gt;

=== Conceptualization ===
Political scientist [[Rupert Emerson]] defined national identity as "a body of people who feel that they are a nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = From Empire to Nation|last = Emerson|first = Rupert|publisher = Beacon Press|year = 1960|isbn = |location = Boston, MA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition of national identity was endorsed by social psychologist, [[Henri Tajfel]], who formulated social identity theory together with John Turner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Social Identity Approach in Social Psychology|last = Reicher|first = Stephen|publisher = The SAGE handbook of identities|year = 2010|isbn = 1446248372|location = London|pages = |last2 = Spears|first2 = Russell|last3 = Haslam|first3 = Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social identity theory]] adopts this definition of national identity, and suggests that the conceptualization of national identity includes both self-categorization and affect. Self-categorization refers to identifying with a nation and viewing oneself as a member of a nation. The affect part refers to the emotion a person has with this identification, such as a sense of belonging, or emotional attachment toward one's nation.&lt;ref name=":34"/&gt; The mere awareness of belonging to a certain group invokes positive emotions about the group, and leads to a tendency to act on behalf of that group, even when the other group members are sometimes personally unknown.&lt;ref name=":34"/&gt;

National identity requires the process of self-categorization and it involves both the identification of [[Ingroups and outgroups|in-group]] (identifying with one's nation), and differentiation of [[Ingroups and outgroups|out-group]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (other nations). By recognizing commonalities such as having common descent and common destiny, people identify with a nation and form an in-group, and at the same time they view people that identify with a different nation as out-groups.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{cite book|title = National Identity|last = Smith|first = Anthony|publisher = University of Nevada Press|year = 1991|isbn = 0874172047|location = |pages = 8–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social identity theory suggests a positive relationship between identification of a nation and derogation of other nations. By identifying with one's nation, people involve in intergroup comparisons, and tend to derogate out-groups.&lt;ref name=":34"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Social Identity Context, Commimtment, Content. Some Current Issues in Research on Social Identity and Self-categorization Theories|last = Turner|first = J.C|publisher = Oxford: Blackwell|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several studies have investigated this relationship between national identity and derogating other countries, and found that identifying with national identity does not necessarily result in out-group derogation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Commentary. National Identity: Pride and prejudice?|last = Hopkins|first = Nick|date = 2001|journal = British Journal of Social Psychology|doi = 10.1348/014466601164795|volume=40|pages=183–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National identity, like other social identities, engenders positive emotions such as pride and love to one's nation, and feeling of obligations toward other citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Differentiation between Social Groups: studies in the social psychology of intergroup relations|last = Tajfel|first = Henri|publisher = Academic Press|year = 1978|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The socialization of national identity, such as socializing national pride and a sense of the country's exceptionalism contributes to harmony among ethnic groups. For example, in the U.S, by integrating diverse ethnic groups in the overarching identity of being an American, people are united by a shared emotion of national pride and the feeling of belonging to the U.S, and thus tend to mitigate ethnic conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Ethnic Groups in Conflict|last = Horowitz|first = Donald|publisher = University of California Press|year = 1985|isbn = 0520053850|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Salience ===
National identity can be most noticeable when the nation confronts external or internal enemy&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; and natural disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://jos.sagepub.com/content/33/2/205.short|title = Natural Disasters and National Identity: time, space, and mythology|last = West|first = Brad|date = 1997|journal = Journal of Sociology|doi = 10.1177/144078339703300205|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Smith|first2 = Philip|volume=33|pages=205–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this phenomenon is the rise in patriotism and national identity in the U.S after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8410977/ns/us_news/t/poll-us-patriotism-continues-soar/#.VklaYXarTIU|title = Poll: U.S. Patriotism Continues to Soar|last = Ross|first = Michael|date = Jul 4, 2005|work = NBC News|access-date = |via = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117031133/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8410977/ns/us_news/t/poll-us-patriotism-continues-soar/#.VklaYXarTIU|archivedate = 2015-11-17|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/grant-lyon/patriotism-versus-nationa_b_953251.html|title = Patriotism vs. Nationalism in a Post 9/11 World|last = Lyon|first = Grant|date = Sep 8, 2011|work = Huffington Post|access-date = |via = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117020339/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/grant-lyon/patriotism-versus-nationa_b_953251.html|archivedate = 2015-11-17|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The identity of being an American is salient after the terrorist attacks and American national identity is evoked.&lt;ref name=":24"/&gt; Having a common threat or having a common goal unite people in a nation and enhance national identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = National Identity: Pragmatic Solutions for Democratic Governance in African Nations|last = Uko-Ima|first = Barrister|publisher = Xlibris LLC|year = 2014|isbn = 9781499047950|location = |pages = 141}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

Sociologist Anthony Smith argues that national identity has the feature of continuity that can transmit and persist through generations. By expressing the myths of having common descent and common destiny, people's sense of belonging to a nation is enhanced.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; However, national identities can disappear across time as more people live in foreign countries for a longer time, and can be challenged by supranational identities, which refers to identifying with a more inclusive, larger group that includes people from multiple nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Advances in Psychological Science: social, personal, and cultural aspects|last = Adair|first = John|publisher = Psychology Press|year = 1998|isbn = 0863774709|location = |pages = 250–251|last2 = Belanger|first2 = David|first3 = Kenneth|last3 = Dion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National identity as a collective phenomenon ==
{{See also|National consciousness}}
[[File:Patriotism (4662136678).jpg|thumb|American flag as a [[national symbol]]]]

National identity can be thought as a collective product.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Through socialization, a system of beliefs, values, assumptions and expectations is transmitted to group members.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; The collective elements of national identity may include national symbols, traditions, and memories of national experiences and achievements. These collective elements are rooted in the nation's history. Depending on how much the individual is exposed to the socialization of this system, people incorporate national identity to their personal identity to different degrees and in different ways, and the collective elements of national identity may become important parts of individual's definition of the self and how they view the world and their own place in it.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite book|title = Nationalism, Patriotism and National Identity: Social-Psychological Dimensions|last = Kelman|first = Herbert|publisher = Nelson-Hall Publishers|year = 1997|isbn = |location = Chicago|pages = 171–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges  ==

=== Ethnic Identity  ===
[[File:Australiadayprotest.jpg|thumb|Aboriginal groups protesting in Brisbane, Australia]]
In countries that have multiple ethnic groups, ethnic identity and national identity may be in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14662043.2011.564469|title = Ethno-national conflict and its management|last = Woods|first = Eric|date = 2011|journal = Commonwealth &amp; Comparative Politics|doi = 10.1080/14662043.2011.564469|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Schertzer|first2 = Robert|last3 = Kaufmann|first3 = Eric|volume=49|pages=153–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; These conflicts are usually referred to as ethno-national conflict. One of the famous ethno-national conflicts is the struggle between the [[Multiculturalism in Australia|Australian]] government and [[Indigenous Australians|aboriginal population in Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.australianhumanitiesreview.org/archive/Issue-September-1998/batty.html|title = Saluting the dot-spangled banner: Aboriginal culture, national identity and the Australian republic|last = Batty|first = Philip|date = 1997|journal = Australian Humanities Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304112914/http://www.australianhumanitiesreview.org/archive/Issue-September-1998/batty.html|archivedate = 2016-03-04|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian government and majority culture imposed policies and framework that supported the majority, European-based cultural values and a national language as English. The aboriginal cultures and languages were not supported by the state, and were nearly eradicated by the state during the 20th century. Because of these conflicts, aboriginal population identify less or do not identify with the national identity of being an Australian, but their ethnic identities are salient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/2000/howard2000a.pdf|title = Social Psychology of Identities|last = Howard|first = Judith|date = 2000|journal = Annual Review of Sociology|doi = 10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.367 |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305014447/http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/2000/howard2000a.pdf|archivedate = 2016-03-05|df =|volume=26|pages=367–393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration ===
As immigration increases, many countries face the challenges of constructing national identity and accommodating immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor = 20097447|title = Immigration and National Identity: Constructing the Nation|last = Doty|first = Roxanne|date = 1996|journal = Review of International Studies|doi = 10.1017/s0260210500118534|pmid =|volume=22|pages=235–255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries are more inclusive in terms of encouraging immigrants to develop a sense of belonging to their host country. For example, [[Multiculturalism in Canada|Canada]] has the highest permanent immigration rates in the world. The Canadian government encourages immigrants to build a sense of belonging to Canada, and has fostered a more inclusive concept of national identity which includes both people born in Canada and immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Social Psychology of Social Problems: The intergroup context|last = de Zavala|first = Agnieszka|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2012|isbn = 1137272228|location = |pages = 102–104|last2 = Cichocka|first2 = Aleksandra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries are less inclusive. For example, Russia has experienced two major waves of immigration influx, one in the 1990s, and the other one after 1998. Immigrants were perceived negatively by the Russian people and were viewed as "unwelcome and abusive guests." Immigrants were considered outsiders and were excluded from sharing the national identity of belonging to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/national-identity-through-the-prism-immigration-the-case-study-modern-russia|title = National Identity through the Prism of Immigration: The Case Study of Modern Russia|date = Jul 7, 2011|accessdate = |website = Kennan Institute|publisher = |last = Liedy|first = Amy|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117024925/https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/national-identity-through-the-prism-immigration-the-case-study-modern-russia|archivedate = 2015-11-17|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Globalization ===
As the world becomes increasingly globalized, international tourism, communication and business collaboration has increased.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite book|title = Globalization and Belonging: The Politics of Identity in a Changing World|last = Croucher|first = Sheila|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year = 2004|isbn = 0742516792|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; People around the world cross national borders more frequently to seek cultural exchange, education, business, and different lifestyles. Globalization promotes common values and experiences, and it also encourages the identification with the [[global community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Global Society and International Relations: Sociological Concepts and Political Perspectives|last = Shaw|first = Martin|publisher = Cambridge: Polity Press|year = 2000|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; People may adapt [[cosmopolitanism]] and view themselves as global beings, or [[Global citizenship|world citizens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.kosmosjournal.org/article/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-global-citizen/|title = What Does it Mean to be a Global Citizen|last = Israel|first = Ronald|date = 2012|journal = Kosmos Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151209235938/http://www.kosmosjournal.org/article/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-global-citizen/|archivedate = 2015-12-09|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend may threaten national identity because globalization undermines the importance of being a citizen of a particular country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Globalization and National Identity: Managing Ethnicity and Cultural Pluralism in Malaysia|last = Ibrahim|first = Zawawi|publisher = Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies|year = 2004|isbn = 0971941645|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several researchers examined globalization and its impact on national identity found that as a country becomes more globalized, patriotism declined, which suggests that the increase of globalization is associated with less loyalty and less willingness to fight for one's own country.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8129.2011.00532.x/abstract|title = Globalisation and the decline of national identity?

In some cases, national identity collides with a person's civil identity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4199">In [[mathematics]], '''noncommutative topology''' is a term used for the relationship between [[topological]] and [[C*-algebra]]ic concepts. The term has its origins in the [[Gelfand-Naimark theorem]], which implies the [[Equivalence of categories|duality]] of the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]]s and the category of [[commutative operation|commutative]] C*-algebras. Noncommutative topology is related to analytic [[noncommutative geometry]].

== Examples ==

The premise behind noncommutative topology is that a noncommutative C*-algebra can be treated like the algebra of complex-valued [[continuous function]]s on a 'noncommutative space' which does not exist classically. Several topological properties can be formulated as properties for the C*-algebras without making reference to commutativity or the underlying space, and so have an immediate generalization.
Among these are:
* [[compact space|compactness]] ([[unital algebra|unital]])
* [[σ-compact space|σ-compactness]] ([[σ-unital algebra|σ-unital]])
* [[Lebesgue covering dimension|dimension]] ([[real rank (C*-algebras)|real]] or [[topological stable rank|stable rank]])
* [[connected space|connectedness]] ([[projectionless C*-algebra|projectionless]])
* [[extremally disconnected space]]s ([[AW*-algebra]]s)

Individual elements of a commutative C*-algebra correspond with continuous functions. And so certain types of functions can correspond to certain properties of a C*-algebra. For example, [[self-adjoint]] elements of a commutative C*-algebra correspond to real-valued continuous functions. Also, [[projection (linear algebra)#Orthogonal projections|projections]] (i.e. self-adjoint [[idempotent]]s) correspond to [[indicator function]]s of [[clopen set]]s.

Categorical constructions lead to some examples. For example, the [[coproduct]] is the [[Disjoint union (topology)|disjoint union]] and thus corresponds to the [[direct sum of algebras]], which is the [[product (category theory)|product]] of C*-algebras. Similarly, [[Product topology]] corresponds to the coproduct of C*-algebras, the [[tensor product of algebras]]. In a more specialized setting,
compactifications of topologies correspond to unitizations of algebras. So the [[Alexandroff extension|one-point compactification]] corresponds to the minimal unitization of C*-algebras, the [[Stone-Čech compactification]] corresponds to the [[multiplier algebra]], and [[corona set]]s corresponds with [[corona algebra]]s.

There are certain examples of properties where multiple generalizations are possible and it is not clear which is preferable. For example, [[probability measure]]s can correspond either to [[state (functional analysis)|states]] or tracial states. Since all states are vacuously 
tracial states in the commutative case, so it is not clear whether the tracial condition is necessary to be a useful generalization.

== K-theory ==
One of the major examples of this idea is the generalization of [[topological K-theory]] to noncommutative C*-algebras in the form of [[operator K-theory]].

A further development in this is a [[functor#Bifunctors|bivariant]] version of K-theory called [[KK-theory]], which has a composition product 

&lt;math&gt;KK(A,B)\times KK(B,C)\rightarrow KK(A,C)&lt;/math&gt;

of which the ring structure in ordinary K-theory is a special case. The product gives the structure of a [[Category (topology)|category]] to KK. It has been related to [[Correspondence (mathematics)|correspondences]] of algebraic varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2545">A '''Pending Meal''' is one paid for at a restaurant or other food joint, to be made available to any future visitor who asks for it. The Pending Meal community [[initiative]] was started on social media in April 2015 by Sarah Rizvi, focusing on restaurants in Dubai. Once the news of the initiative started to spread, many local restaurants were willing to tie up and provide their support too. The idea spread to other areas including [[Sharjah]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Ras Al Khaimah]], U.S.A, Canada, Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan.

The Pending Meal movement encourages people to pay for someone else’s meal at a food outlet so the less fortunate can walk in and eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/your-say/your-view/pending-meal-pay-for-someone-else-s-food-1.1531685|title=Pending Meal: pay for someone else's food|first=Huda|last=Tabrez|date=8 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative is not limited to [[United Arab Emirates]] only and the founder believes that wherever there is a hungry mouth, there is a Pending Meal to feed. The idea originated from the concept of [[suspended coffee]] practiced in some coffee shops in [[Naples]]. Customers would pay for their own coffee and when they wanted to, could pay for an extra ‘suspended coffee’ or a '[[suspended meal]]' which was meant for the less fortunate. Thus, a person who was hungry or thirsty could walk into the cafe and ask if there was a suspended coffee or suspended meal that they could drink or eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.bayut.com/pending-meal-movement-feeding-the-less-fortunate/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715055120/http://blog.bayut.com/pending-meal-movement-feeding-the-less-fortunate/ |archivedate=2015-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no limit to how much one can donate to the cause. “There have been people who have paid in advance for the meal of just one person and some have even paid for 15,” said Rizvi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en-maktoob.news.yahoo.com/charity-begins-restaurants-043546130.html|title=Charity begins at restaurants|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pending Meal initiative is not a charity organization and does not collect funds (in any form). The initiative is purely encouraging people to give back to community by providing less fortunate with a meal so that no one has to stay hungry.

{{Hazara people}}
The '''persecution of Hazara people''' refers to the discrimination of the [[Hazaras]], who are primarily from the central highland region of [[Hazarajat]] in [[Afghanistan]]. Significant populations of the Hazara people are also found in [[Quetta]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Mashad]], [[Iran]] as part of the [[Hazara diaspora|Hazara]] and [[Afghan diaspora]]s. The [[persecution]] of Hazara people dates back to the 16th century, with [[Babur]] from [[Kabulistan]].&lt;ref name="Leyden"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian//pf?file=03501051&amp;ct=92 |title=Events Of The Year 910 (1525) |page=5 |editor=John Leyden |editor2=William Erskine |work=[[Baburnama|Memoirs of Babur]] |publisher=[[Packard Humanities Institute]] |year=1921 |authorlink=Babur |accessdate=2012-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114042010/http://persian.packhum.org/persian//pf?file=03501051&amp;ct=92# |archive-date=November 14, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massacre and displacement of Hazaras in 1888 to 93|It is reported that]] during the reign of [[Abdur Rahman Khan|Emir Abdur Rahman]] (1880–1901), thousands of Hazaras were killed, expelled and enslaved.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hazara-2|title=HAZĀRA ii.

The Hazara people have also been the victims of massacres committed by the [[Taliban]] and [[al-Qaeda]]. {{as of|2014|df=US}}, conditions have not improved for the Hazaras in Afghanistan and thousands continue to be persecuted in neighboring Pakistan by [[Sunni]] extremist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thacker|first1=Purvi|title=Pakistan's Hazara: 'It's like living in jail'|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/humanrights/2014/12/pakistan-hazara-it-like-living-jail-2014123114655754509.html|accessdate=27 October 2017|work=Al Jazeera|date=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Afghanistan==
{{see also|1888-1893 Uprisings of Hazaras|Kuchi–Hazara conflict}}
Hazaras are historically the most restrained ethnic minority group in the state and have witnessed slight improvements in the circumstances even with the setup of modern Afghanistan. The discrimination against this ethnic group has continued for centuries, instigated by Pashtuns and other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/geopedia/Hazara_People|title=Hazara People|publisher=National Geographic - GeoPedia|year=2008|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syed Askar Mousavi]], a contemporary Hazara writer, estimates that more than half of the entire population of Hazarajat was driven out of their villages, including many who were massacred. "It is difficult to verify such an estimate, but the memory of the conquest of the Hazārajāt by ʿAbd-al-Raḥmān Khan certainly remains vivid among the Hazāras themselves, and has heavily influenced their relations with the Afghan state throughout the 20th century."&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; 
The British from neighboring British India, who were heavily involved in Afghanistan, did not document such a large figure. Others claim that Hazaras began leaving their hometown of Hazarajat due to poverty and in search of employment mostly in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="hazara-1"&gt;{{cite web |work=Arash Khazeni, Alessandro Monsutti, Charles M. Kieffer |publisher=Encyclopædia Iranica |title=HAZĀRA |url=http://iranicaonline.org/articles/hazara-1 |date=December 15, 2003 |location=United States |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these Hazaras immigrated to neighbouring [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], where they were provided permanent settlement by the government of British India.&lt;ref name="Who are the Hazara"/&gt; Others settled in and around [[Mashad]], in the [[Khorasan Province]] of [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="hazara-1"/&gt;

The Hazaras of Afghanistan faced severe political, social and economic tyranny and denial of basic civil rights.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt; In the late 19th century, the Hazaras along with their Shia counterpart [[Qizilbash]] sided with the invading [[British Raj|British-led Indians]] against the Sunni [[Ethnic groups of Afghanistan]]. In 1933, [[Abdul Khaliq Hazara (assassin)|Abdul Khaliq Hazara]], a Hazara student assassinated Afghan King [[Mohammed Nadir Shah|Nadir Khan]].

=== Persecution and marginalization ===

Notably, after the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]], Shah Abdur conducted a campaign of repression in Hazarajat, but it was met with fierce opposition by Hazara tribal leaders. The first uprising was conducted in correlation with Shah Adbur's cousin, Mohammad Eshaq who sought to overthrow the Shah. This revolt of Hazara nationalists and anti-Shah partisans was brief, because Shah Adbur astutely used sectarian strife to divide the Hazara Shias and the Sunni partisans, thus allowing him to easily defeat his foes.&lt;ref name="The Mongol Hazaras in Afghanistan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dtsjournal.com/2016/04/01/the-mongol-hazaras-in-afghanistan/ |title=The Mongol Hazaras in Afghanistan |publisher= University of Toronto Journal of Diaspora and Transnationalism |date= April 1, 2016|accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of the Hazaras in their first revolt allowed Shah Adbur to impose taxes on Hazarajat for the first time, and they severely impeded the autonomy of Hazarajat, because numerous Pashtun soldiers and government officials were garrisoned in Hazarajat in order to ensure its compliance with the Pashtun-run state. Subsequently, the Pashtuns garrisoned in Hazarajat, treated the local Hazaras inferiorly and often committed arbitrary acts of cruelty and brutality against them. This caused great unrest and a deepening hatred between the Hazaras and their Pashtun rulers, causing the Hazaras to reach their tipping point in 1892. When a local Pashtun garrison searched the home of a Hazara chieftain for arms, but the pretext was false, the garrison subsequently tied the chieftain up and made him watch while they raped his wife.&lt;ref name="The Mongol Hazaras in Afghanistan"/&gt;

The outrage that followed allowed the Hazaras to unite once again in order to overthrow most of the local Pashtun garrisons in Hazarajat. This newfound zealous fever fermented fierce resistance against Shah Adbur and his forces. Witnessing the rising tide, Shah Adbur felt he had no choice but to wage a [[jihad]] against the Shia Hazaras, and under this [[casus belli]] Shah Adbur was able to muster around 150,000 troops.&lt;ref name="The Mongol Hazaras in Afghanistan"/&gt; The resulting conflict was brutal and led to a great loss of life on both sides. The Hazaras fought with vigour but the attrition they faced due to lack of rations, led to their demise at the uprising's epicenter of Oruzgan.&lt;ref name="The Mongol Hazaras in Afghanistan"/&gt; The aftermath of the uprising was a genocide at the hands of Shah Adbur, who wiped out more than half of the entire Hazara population, and caused a myriad of people to be driven out of their villages.&lt;ref name="The Mongol Hazaras in Afghanistan"/&gt; Prior to the genocide, Hazaras made up more than half of Afghanistan's total population. Although once the largest ethnicity, they were now a minority, constituting roughly 9% of Afghanistan's total population.&lt;ref name="The Mongol Hazaras in Afghanistan"/&gt; Accordingly, in order to stifle Hazara influence Shah Adbur fragmented Hazarajat and demarcated it so that it would encompass numerous other provinces, where the Hazara are now a minority.

=== Afshar ===
{{main|Afshar Operation}}

In February 1993, a two-day military operation was conducted by the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] government and the Saudi-backed Sunni [[Wahhabi]] [[Ittihad-i Islami]] militia led by [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]]. At that time Ittihad-i Islami was allied with the government of [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]]. The military operation was conducted in order to seize control of the Afshar district in west Kabul where the Shia [[Hezb-e Wahdat]] militia (which was allied to [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]'s Sunni [[Hezb-i Islami]] and backed by Pakistan) was based and from where it was shelling civilian areas in northern Kabul. The operation also intended to capture Wahdat leader Abdul Ali Mazari. The Afshar district, situated on the slopes of Mount Afshar west of Kabul, is a densely populated district. The area is predominantly inhabited by Shia [[Hazara people]]. The Afshar military operation escalated into what became known as the Afshar massacre when the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] backed [[Wahhabi]] militia of [[Ittehad-al-Islami|Ittihad-e-Islami]] went on a rampage through Afshar, killing, raping, looting and burning houses. Two out of nine Islamic State sub-commanders, Anwar Dangar (later joined the [[Taliban]]) and Mullah Izzat, were also reported as leading troops that carried out abuses. The Islamic State government in collaboration with the then enemy militia of Hezb-e Wahdat as well as in cooperation with Afshar civilians established a commission to investigate the crimes that had taken place in Afshar. The commission found that around 70 people died during the street fighting and between 700 and 750 people were abducted and never returned by Abdul Rasul Sayyaf's men. These abducted victims were most likely killed or died in captivity.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"&gt;{{cite web |year=2006 |url = http://hrw.org/reports/2005/afghanistan0605/5.htm#_Toc105552365|title = Ittihad |publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]] |accessdate = 2012-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc_2001"&gt;{{cite news |date=December 2, 2001 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent/1682466.stm|title = A personal account|publisher = BBC News | last= Phil Rees | accessdate = 2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of women were abducted during the operation as well.&lt;ref name="Book_Anderson"&gt;{{cite book | last = John Lee Anderson | authorlink = | title = The Lion's Grave |year=2002|page= 224 | publisher = Atlantic Books| isbn= 1-84354-118-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mazar-i-Sharif ===

Following the 1997 massacre of 3,000 Taliban prisoners by [[Abdul Malik Pahlawan]] in [[Mazar-i-Sharif]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1615824.stm#pahlawan |title=Afghan powerbrokers: Who's who |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date= November 19, 2001|accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; thousands of Hazara men and boys were massacred by other Taliban members in the same city in August 1998.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human rights]] organizations reported that the dead were lying on the streets for weeks before the Taliban allowed their burial due to stench and fear of epidemics.

=== Robatak Pass ===

The pass connecting the settlements of [[Kholm, Afghanistan|Tashkurgan]] and [[Puli Khumri|Pule Khumri]] is known as Robatak Pass. A mass murder was carried out there by Taliban in May 2000 in which 31 people were reported dead. Twenty-six of the victims were [[Ismaïlia|Ismaili]] Hazara from Baghalan province. Their remains were found to the northeast of the pass, in a neighborhood known as Hazara Mazari, on the border between Baghlan and Samngan provinces. The victims were detained four months before their execution by Taliban troops between January 5 and January 14, 2000.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch Robatak Pass"&gt;{{cite web |year=2006 |url = https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/afghanistan/afghan101-04.htm#P176_25561|title = Massacre at Robatak Pass, May 2000|publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]]| accessdate = 2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington File"/&gt;

=== Yakawlang ===

In January 2001 the Taliban committed a mass execution of Hazara people in [[Yakawlang District]] of [[Bamyan province]], Afghanistan. This started on January 8 and lasted for four days; it took the lives of 170 men. Taliban apprehended about 300 people, including employees of local humanitarian organizations. They were grouped to various assemblage points where they were shot dead in public view. Around 73 women, children and elderly were taking shelter in a local mosque when Taliban fired rockets at the mosque.&lt;ref name="Washington File"&gt;{{cite web |year=2001 |url = http://usinfo.org/wf-archive/2001/011017/epf312.htm|title = Fact Sheet: The Taliban's Betrayal of the Afghan People|publisher = Office of International Information Programs| accessdate = 2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch Yakawlang"&gt;{{cite web |year=2006 |url = https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/afghanistan/afghan101-03.htm#P126_15001|title = Massacre in yakaolang|publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]]| accessdate = 2012-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Khas Urozgan ===

In June 2010, at least nine Hazara men were killed in an ambush in [[Khas Urozgan District]]. The Taliban took responsibility for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Alissa J.

=== Zabul ===

In November 2015, Afghan militants claiming loyalty to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] beheaded seven ethnic Hazara civilians who had been abducted in the southern Afghan province of [[Zabul]]. Their throats were cut with metal wire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Afghan Fighters Loyal to ISIS Beheaded 7 Hostages, Officials Say |author=Mujib Mashal |author2=Taimoor Shahnov |date=November 10, 2015 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/10/world/asia/afghan-fighters-loyal-to-isis-beheaded-7-hostages-officials-say.html |page=A10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims were four men, two women, and a 9-year-old girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The beheading of a 9-year-old girl prompted huge protests in Afghanistan |author=Ishaan Tharoor |date=November 12, 2015 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/12/the-beheading-of-a-9-year-old-girl-prompted-huge-protests-in-afghanistan/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dehmazang bombings===

On July 23, 2016 two [[ISIL|Islamic State]] suicide bombers blow themselves during the peaceful protest 'Junbish Roshnaye' in [[Kabul]] killing 160 and wounded over 200 people.&lt;ref name="bbckabul"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36874570 | title=Kabul explosion: Islamic State 'admits attack on Hazara protest' | publisher=BBC Asia | date=23 July 2016 | accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attackers were reportedly from the local affiliate of the so-called Islamic State, known as the "Khurasan Province" (IS-Khurasan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rafiq|first1=Arif|title=The Persecution of Afghanistan's Hazaras Has Less to Do with Religion Than You Think|url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-persecution-afghanistans-hazaras-has-less-do-religion-17174|website=nationalinterest.org|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ashura attacks===
18 people were killed and 54 were injured in July 2016 at Kabul's landmark Sakhi Shrine by a gunman wearing an Afghan National Security Forces uniform. The attack took place on the eve of Ashura, the Shia mourning day. Responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Islamic State, or ISIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shuja|first1=Ahmad|title=Afghanistan's Shia Hazara Suffer Latest Atrocity|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/10/13/afghanistans-shia-hazara-suffer-latest-atrocity|website=hrw.org|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The next morning, an improvised electronic device(IED) killed at least 15 Hazara people in the Balkh province of northern Afghanistan. ISIS claimed responsibility for this attack as well. These attacks show the growing threat of the IS to the Hazara people.

===Post-Taliban era===
There has been a significant improvement in the status and treatment of Hazaras in Afghanistan. The new Afghan constitution now recognizes them as one of the country's ethnic minorities, and they now have the full right to Afghan citizenship. In Afghanistan's recent parliamentary election, Hazaras won around 25 per cent of the seats.&lt;ref name="Afghanistan Hazaras"&gt;{{cite web|title=Afghanistan Hazaras|url=http://minorityrights.org/minorities/hazaras/|website=minorityrights.org|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazara have also pursued higher education, enrolled in the army, and many have top government positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sappenfield|first1=Mark|title=Afghanistan's success story: The liberated Hazara minority|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0806/p06s02-wosc.html?page=2|website=csmonitor.com|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Mohammad Mohaqiq, a Hazara from the Hizb-i-Wahdat party, ran in the 2004 presidential election in Afghanistan, and Karim Khalili became the Vice President of Afghanistan. Since ousting the Taliban in late 2001, billions of dollars have been poured into Afghanistan for several large-scale reconstruction projects that took place from August 2012. For example, there have been more than 5000 kilometers of road pavement completed across Afghanistan, of which little was done in central Afghanistan Hazarajat. On the other hand, the Band-e Amir in the Bamyan Province became the first national park of Afghanistan. The road from Kabul to Bamyan was also built, along with new police stations, government institutions, hospitals, and schools in the Bamyan Province, Daykundi Province, and others. The first ski resort of Afghanistan was also established in the Bamyan Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levinson|first1=Charles|title=Since Skiing Came to Afghanistan, It Has Been Pretty Much All Downhill|url=wsj.com|website=wsj.com|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is still a large degree of discrimination against Hazaras, however. A new danger in the form of ISIS has become especially prominent in recent years, and they have carried out abductions, extortions and violent killings against Hazaras.&lt;ref name="Afghanistan: Who are the Hazaras"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hucal|first1=Sarah|title=Afghanistan: Who are the Hazaras?|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/06/afghanistan-hazaras-160623093601127.html|website=aljazeera.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rising power of warlords, who the Hazara people perceive as a direct threat, has also been a matter of concern. There have been ethnic tensions and violent clashes with nomadic Kuchis over land access issues.&lt;ref name="Afghanistan Hazaras"/&gt; Taliban fighters continue to abduct and execute Hazaras travelling in vehicles. Furthermore, anti-Hazara sentiments became stronger when the former director of the National Directorate of Security, Amrullah Saleh, accused Iran of interfering in Afghan affairs through Shias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ali Seerat|first1=Rustam|title=Peril and Persecution in Afghanistan|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/08/27/peril-and-persecution-in-afghanistan/|website=foreignpolicy.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazara activists still believe that the government does not serve their people's security needs sufficiently. Parts of central Afghanistan, like the unofficial Hazara capital Bamiyan, are among the country's poorest and often lack even basic necessities like water and electricity.&lt;ref name="Afghanistan: Who are the Hazaras"/&gt; Hazara people held a protest in March 2016 against the government's decision to move a proposed power line project out of Bamiyan, seeing it as another form of ethnic discrimination.

==Pakistan==
The history of Hazara people in Pakistan dates back to the 1840s, when Hazara tribesmen from [[Hazarajat]] began migration to colonial India because of persecution by Pashtuns and Tajiks. Many Hazaras were enlisted in the British Indian Army during the first Anglo-Afghan War (1838-1840). The mass-migration and permanent settlements started in the 1890s when Emir Abdul Rahman Khan started persecuting the Hazaras of Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://minoritysupportpakistan.com/The_Hazara_Shia_of_PakistanvApril_16_edited.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Hazara are [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] Muslims with a sizable [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] minority. Pakistan is home to an estimated 20% Shia Muslim population. Sectarian violence in Pakistan started in 1980s.

===Quetta===
{{further|Persecution of Hazaras in Quetta}}
In 2011 the persecution of Hazaras in Quetta has left at least 1300 dead and more than 1500 wounded. The victims include high-profile community members, laborers, women and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://samaa.tv/newsdetail.aspx?ID=37032&amp;CID=1 |title=International commission demanded to probe Hazara killings |publisher=Samaa Tv |date=2011-10-01 |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029183755/http://samaa.tv/newsdetail.aspx?ID=37032&amp;CID=1 |archivedate=October 29, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One third of the victims are children.

In response to these killings, worldwide demonstrations were held to condemn the persecution of Hazaras in Quetta.

As a consequence of the attacks there has been a recent exodus of Hazaras trying to flee the violence. They are headed mainly to [[Australia]] &amp; other Western Countries, where thousands of them have taken shelter and successfully relocated after obtaining refugee status. To get there, they complete an illegal and treacherous journey across [[Southeast Asia]] through air, land and sea that has already left hundreds of them dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/world/asia/fleeing-violence-in-pakistan-hazaras-brave-uncertain-journey.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0&amp;hp | work=The New York Times | first=Declan | last=Walsh | title=Fleeing Violence in Pakistan, Hazaras Brave Uncertain Journey |date=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://dawn.com/2012/09/19/hazaras-exodus-to-the-land-down-under/|title=Hazaras: Exodus to the land down under|author=Zofeen T.

The most recent attack occurred on October 10, 2017, when two unidentified attackers on a motorcycle opened fire on a van heading for a nearby vegetable market, killing the driver and four others, continuing the trend of attacks against Hazaras in Quetta. This series of bombings, attacks and assassinations have forced them to retreat to two heavily protected enclaves on either side of the city:  Marriabad and Hazara Town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hashim|first1=Asad|title=Hazara Shia Muslims attacked in Pakistan's Quetta|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/gunmen-target-hazara-shia-muslims-quetta-city-171009094724088.html|website=aljazeera.com|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karachi===
So far Hundreds of Hazara individuals have been killed in Karachi, but none of the killers has never been brought to Justice. Among the dead were social workers &amp; intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.dawn.com/2002/07/02/local16.htm |title=Karachi: Police make public arrest of sectarian activists |newspaper=[[DAWN (newspaper)|DAWN]] |date=July 2, 2002 |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
The main character in [[Khaled Hosseini]]'s novel ''[[The Kite Runner]]'' is Amir, a [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] boy who has a Hazara friend, Hassan, in 1970s Afghanistan. They are bullied by an older Pashtun who expresses scorn for the Hazara people and rapes Hassan.

In the book ''In The Sea There Are Crocodiles'', Eniatollah Akbari, a Hazara boy, details his journey to escape persecution in Afghanistan.

The onion smell puts off [[carrot root fly]], while the smell of carrots puts off [[onion fly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Companion Planting Guide |url=http://www.thompson-morgan.com/companion-planting-guide |publisher=Thompson &amp; Morgan |accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Polyculture''' is [[agriculture]] using multiple crops in the same space, providing [[crop diversity]] in imitation of the diversity of natural ecosystems, and avoiding large stands of single crops, or [[monoculture]]. This includes [[multi-cropping]], [[intercropping]], [[companion planting]], [[beneficial weed]]s, and [[alley cropping]]. It is the raising at the same time and place of more than one species of plant.&lt;ref name="CS"&gt;Chrispeels, M.J.; Sadava, D.E. 1994. "Farming Systems: Development, Productivity, and Sustainability". pp. 25–57 in ''Plants, Genes, and Agriculture''. Jones and Bartlett, Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Polyculture is one of the principles of [[permaculture]].

==Advantages==
Polyculture often requires more labor but it has two main advantages over monoculture.

Polyculture reduces susceptibility to disease. For example, a study in [[China]] showed that planting several varieties of [[rice]] in the same field increased yields by 89%, largely because of a dramatic (94%) decrease in the incidence of disease, which made [[fungicides]] redundant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2000 |url=http://www.mindfully.org/GE/Rice-Diversity-Yield.htm |title=Genetic Diversity and Disease Control in Rice |journal=Nature |issue=406 |pages=718–722 |author=Youyong Zhu |doi=10.1038/35021046 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118044541/http://www.mindfully.org/GE/Rice-Diversity-Yield.htm |archivedate=2011-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyculture increases local [[biodiversity]]. This is one example of [[reconciliation ecology]], or accommodating biodiversity within human landscapes. This may also form part of a [[biological pest control]] program.

The '''''Predator''''' film series is a [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[action film|action]] [[media franchise|franchise]] based on a race of [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|fictional extraterrestrials]] created by Jim Thomas and John Thomas. Produced by [[20th Century Fox]], the series started in 1987 with the film ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', which led to two sequels and [[novel]], [[comic book]], and [[video game]] spin-offs. Related to the franchise is the [[Alien vs. Predator (franchise)|''Alien vs. Predator'']], which combine the eponymous [[Predator (alien)|Predator]] with [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|the creatures]] from the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' film series]].

==Background==
''Predator'' was [[John McTiernan]]'s first studio film as director. The studio hired screenplay writer [[Shane Black]] to not only play a supporting role in the film, but to keep an eye on McTiernan due to the director's inexperience. [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] was originally cast as the film's creature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teletext.co.uk/bigscreen/your-film-views/2c716751d7abb28f897edd93c630b4ef/Vortex+Van+Damme+in+Predator.aspx |title=Teletext Big Screen Vortex |publisher=Teletext.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea being that the physical action star would use his martial arts skills to make the creature an agile, [[ninja]]-esque hunter. When compared to [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Carl Weathers]] and [[Jesse Ventura]], actors known for their bodybuilding regimes, it became apparent a more physically imposing man was needed to make the creature appear threatening. Eventually, Van Damme was removed from the film and replaced by the actor and mime artist [[Kevin Peter Hall]].

The predator creature's design is credited to special effects artist [[Stan Winston]]. While flying to [[Japan]] with ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' director [[James Cameron]], Winston, who had been hired to design the Predator, was doing concept art on the flight. Cameron saw what he was drawing and said, "I always wanted to see something with [[Mandible (arthropod)|mandibles]]". Winston then included them in his designs. Schwarzenegger recommended Winston after his experience working on ''[[The Terminator]]''.

The film's creature was originally designed with a long neck, a [[dog]]-like head and a single eye. This design was abandoned when it became apparent that the jungle locations would make shooting the complex design too difficult. Originally, the studio contracted the makeup effects for the alien from [[Richard Edlund]]'s ''Boss Film Creature Shop''. However, with problems filming the creature in Mexico and attempts to create a convincing monster of Van Damme, wearing a much different body suit, failing, makeup effects responsibilities were given to Winston and his studio, [[R/Greenberg Associates]]. According to former ''Boss Film Creature Shop'' makeup supervisor Steve Johnson, the makeup failed because of an impractical design by McTiernan that included {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} length extensions that gave the creature a backward bent [[satyr]]-leg. The design did not work in the jungle locations. After six weeks of shooting in the jungles of [[Palenque, Mexico]], the production had to shut down so that Winston could make the new creature. This took eight months and then filming resumed for five weeks.

The sound of the creature was provided by [[Peter Cullen]]. Despite his resolution not to voice any more monsters following injuries to his throat sustained during the [[Dubbing (filmmaking)#Automated Dialogue Replacement / post-sync|ADR]] of [[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]], his agent convinced him to audition. The bubbling sound was inspired by a mixture of the visual of the creature and his recollection of a dying horseshoe crab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=62478 |title=Prime Directive: An Exclusive Interview with Peter Cullen |publisher=dvdtimes.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

R/Greenberg Associates created the film's optical effects, including the creature's ability to become [[invisible]], its [[thermal vision]] point-of-view, its glowing blood, and the [[electric spark]] effects. The invisibility effect was achieved by having someone in a bright [[Chroma key|red suit]] (because it was the farthest opposite of the green of the jungle and the blue of the sky) the size of the creature. The take was then repeated without the actors using a 30% wider lens on the camera. When the two takes were combined optically, a vague outline of the alien could be seen with the background scenery bending around its shape. For the thermal vision, [[infrared film]] could not be used because it did not register in the range of [[body temperature]] [[wavelength]]s. The glowing blood was achieved by green liquid from [[glow stick|chem-lite sticks]] used by campers. The electrical sparks were [[rotoscoped]] animation using white paper pin registered on portable light tables to black-and-white prints of the film frames. The drawings were [[compositing|composited]] by the optical crew for the finished effects.

Also, in an interview on ''Predator'' Special Edition, actor Carl Weathers said many of the actors would secretly wake up as early as 3 a.m. to work out before the day's shooting, in order to look "pumped" during the scene. Weathers also stated that he would act as if his physique was naturally given to him, and would work out only after all the other actors were nowhere to be seen. It was reported that actor [[Sonny Landham]] was so unstable on the set that a bodyguard was hired; not to protect Landham, but to protect the other cast members from him.

According to Schwarzenegger, filming was physically demanding as he had to swim in very cold water and spent three weeks covered in mud for the climactic battle with the alien. In addition, cast and crew endured very cold temperatures in the Mexican jungle that required [[heat lamp]]s to be on all of the time. Schwarzenegger also faced the challenge of working with Kevin Peter Hall who could not see in the creature's suit. Hall could not see out of the mask and had to rehearse his scenes with it off and then memorize where everything was. The outfit was difficult to wear because it was heavy and off-balance.

The film was particularly successful and subsequently inspired a number of [[comic books]], [[video games]] and popular anecdotes within the media. Schwarzenegger was asked to reprise his role in a ''Predator'' sequel, but was already attached to ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' and could not accept the role. The character was rewritten from the developing sequel's script, and the sequel to ''Predator'', directed by [[Stephen Hopkins (director)|Stephen Hopkins]], was scheduled for 1990.

Due to excessive violence, ''[[Predator 2]]'' was the first film to be given the newly instituted [[NC-17]] rating in the United States. It was eventually rated R by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] after being re-cut to its final theatrical length. The film cast [[Danny Glover]] in the lead role, and reprised Kevin Peter Hall as the Predator. Also, returning to the role of [[List of Predator characters#Anna|Anna]] in the sequel, [[Elpidia Carrillo]] was slated to be in two scenes but was cut back to a brief appearance on a video screen in the government agents' surveillance trailer. Her character is showing damage to the [[Central America]]n jungle caused by the explosion at the conclusion of the first film

About this, Black said: "I would love to say we've been planning a trilogy, but I take one day at a time, in motion-picture terms that's one movie at a time."&lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/2018/film/news/the-predator-reboot-shane-black-1202874827/&lt;/ref&gt; The box office results of The Predator in China may encourage 20th Century Fox to press on with another sequel.

==Crossover series==
{{Main|Alien vs. Predator}}

Inspired by the [[Dark Horse Comics]] series, the filmmakers of ''[[Predator 2]]'' (1990) incorporated an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] in which an Alien skull was seen in a Predator trophy case. Expansions upon this [[Shared fictional universe|shared universe]] between the ''Alien'' and ''Predator'' franchises followed, through comics and video games, until a film franchise was launched with the release of ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' in 2004, followed by the sequel ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'' in 2007, which spawned various new comics, novels, video games, and other merchandise based upon or inspired by the films.

===''Alien vs. Predator'' (2004)===
{{main|Alien vs. Predator (film)}}

In 2004, a Predator mothership arrives in [[Earth]] orbit to draw humans to an ancient Predator training ground on [[Bouvet Island|Bouvetøya]], an island about one thousand miles north of [[Antarctica]]. A buried [[pyramid]] giving off a "heat bloom" attracts a group of explorers led by Charles Bishop Weyland ([[Lance Henriksen]]), the original founder and CEO of Weyland Industries, who unknowingly activates an Alien egg production line as a hibernating Alien Queen is awakened within the pyramid. Three Predators descend unto the planet and enters the structure, killing all humans in their way with the intention of hunting the newly formed Aliens, while the scattered explorers are captured alive by Aliens and implanted with embryos. Two Predators die in the ensuing battle with an Alien.  The third Predator allies itself with the lone surviving human, Alexa "Lex" Woods ([[Sanaa Lathan]]), while in their way out of the pyramid as it is destroyed by the Predator's wrist bomb and eventually battles with the escaped Alien Queen on the surface. The Queen is defeated by being dragged down by a water tower into the dark depths of the frozen sea, but not before she fatally wounds the last Predator. The orbiting Predator mothership uncloaks and the crew retrieves the fallen Predator. A Predator elder gives Lex a spear as a sign of respect, and then departs. Once in orbit it is revealed that an Alien [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Chestburster|Chestburster]] was present within the corpse, thus a Predalien hybrid is born.

===''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' (2007)===
{{main|Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem}}

Set immediately after the events of the previous film, the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Predalien|Predalien]] hybrid aboard the Predator scout ship, having just separated from the mothership shown in the previous film, has grown to full adult size and sets about killing the Predators aboard the ship, causing it to crash in the small town of [[Gunnison, Colorado]]. The last surviving Predator activates a distress beacon containing a video recording of the Predalien, which is received by a [[veteran]] Predator on the Predator homeworld, who sets off towards Earth to "clean up" the infestation. When it arrives, the Predator tracks the Aliens into a section of the sewer below the town. He removes evidence of their presence as he moves along using a corrosive blue liquid and uses a laser net to try to contain the creatures, but the Aliens still manage to escape into the town above. The Predator fashions a plasma pistol from its remaining plasma caster and hunts Aliens all across town, accidentally cutting the power to the town in the process. During a confrontation with human survivors, the Predator loses its plasma pistol. The Predator then fights the Predalien singlehandedly, and the two mortally wound one another just as the US air force drops a tactical nuclear bomb on the town, incinerating both combatants along with the Predalien's warriors and hive, as well as the few remaining humans in the town. The salvaged plasma pistol is then taken to a Ms. Yutani of the Yutani Corporation, foreshadowing an advancement in technology leading to the future events of the ''Alien'' films.

'''Rogneda of Polotsk''' (962–1002) is the [[Slavic (language)|Slavic]] name for '''Ragnhild''', was a Princess consort of Rus. She was the daughter of [[Rogvolod|Ragnvald]] (Slavic: [[Rogvolod]]) came from [[Scandinavia]] and established himself at [[Polatsk]] in the mid-10th century. 

==Life==
It has been speculated that Rogneda belonged to the [[Ynglings]] royal family of [[Norway]]. In or about 980, [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir]], on learning that she was betrothed to his half-brother [[Yaropolk I of Kiev]], took Polotsk and forced Rogneda to marry him. Having raped Rogneda in the presence of her parents, he ordered them to be killed, along with two of Rogneda's brothers.

Rogneda gave him several children. The four sons were [[Yaroslav the Wise]], Vsevolod, [[Mstislav of Chernigov]], and [[Izyaslav of Polotsk]]. She also bore two daughters, one of whom is named by [[Nestor the Chronicler]] as [[Predslava]] (taken as a concubine of [[Boleslaus I of Poland]], according to [[Gallus Anonymus|Gallus]]). A later chronicle tells a story, most likely taken from a [[Norse saga]], of Rogneda plotting against Vladimir and asking her elder son, Izyaslav, to kill him. As was the Norse royal custom, she was sent with her elder son to govern the land of her parents, i.e. Polotsk. Izyaslav's line continued to rule Polotsk and the newly found town of [[Izyaslavl]] until the [[Mongol invasion of Russia|Mongol invasion]].

After Vladimir converted to Christianity and took [[Anna Porphyrogeneta]] as his wife, he had to divorce all his previous wives, including Rogneda. After that, she entered the convent and took the name '''Anastasia'''.

==Legacy==
Around 1825 [[Kondraty Fyodorovich Ryleyev|Kondraty Ryleev]] wrote a narrative poem entitled ''Rogneda''.  This poem became a literary source for her portrayal in the nationalist Russian opera ''[[Rogneda (opera)|Rogneda]]'' by [[Alexander Serov]], which premiered in 1865.

'''Russian School Defense Staff''' or '''Headquarters for the Protection of Russian Schools''' ({{lang-ru|Штаб защиты русских школ}}; {{lang-lv|Krievu skolu aizstāvības štābs}}) — movement in [[Latvia]] for protection of public secondary education in Russian. Leaders: [[Vladimir Buzayev]], [[Gennady Kotov]], [[Yury Petropavlovsky]], [[Miroslav Mitrofanov]], [[Mihail Tyasin]], [[Viktor Dergunov]], [[Vladislav Rafalsky]], for some time also [[Alexander Yuryevich Kazakov|Alexander Kazakov]] (deported out of Latvia in 2004), one of the most prominent spokesmen — [[Yakov Pliner]].&lt;ref&gt;''Boguševiča T.''

==Aims of the movement==
Cancelling the Education law provisions, which originally ordered the language of instruction in public secondary schools (Forms 10-12) to be only Latvian (later - at least 60% Latvian) since 2004. It also supports providing effective learning of Latvian language in the Latvian language and literature lessons and specific preparation of teachers for Russian schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shtab.lv/main.php?w2=about Штаб защиты русских школ, официальный сайт&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Staff was founded&lt;ref&gt;Заявление о создании штаба по защите русских школ. Published in: "Ракурс" No. 1/2003 The text of the founding statement is available [http://www.rusojuz.lv/ru/party/istorija/18988-/ online {{ru icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; in April 2003 as a coalition of various organizations, most prominent being [[ForHRUL]], and later expanded, involving nonpartisan people. In 2003–2004, the Staff has organized political demonstrations (according to the [[Freedom House]] and political scientist T. Boguševiča, the biggest ones in Latvia since the beginning of the 1990s) to protest to expanding use of Latvian language in Russian schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=search&amp;docid=473c550523 Freedom in the World 2005.

As a result, the Education law was amended in February 2004, allowing to teach up to 40% in the forms 10-12 in minority languages. The proportion of teaching 60% of subjects in Latvian and 40% in Russian, according to BISS research, was supported by 20% of the teachers, 15% of pupils and 13% of parents in minority schools and most stated that they would rather support bilingual instruction in all subjects; only 15% of teachers thought that no reform was needed, while this opinion was expressed by 36% of parents and 44% of pupils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://providus.lv/article_files/1091/original/cittaut.pdf?1326906351 Cittautiešu jauniešu integrācija Latvijas sabiedrībā izglītības reformas kontekstā.

'''Self-hatred''' (also called '''self loathing''') refers to an extreme dislike or [[Hate|hatred]] of oneself, or being angry at or even [[Prejudice|prejudiced]] against oneself.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/feeling-our-way/201512/four-kinds-depression-and-self-hate &lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to designate a dislike or hatred of a group, [[family]], [[social class]], or [[stereotype]] to which one belongs and/or has. For instance, "ethnic self-hatred" is the extreme dislike of one's ethnic group or cultural classification. It may be associated with aspects of [[autophobia]].

The term "self-hatred" is used infrequently by psychologists and psychiatrists, who would usually describe people who hate themselves as "persons with low [[self-esteem]]".{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Self-hatred and [[shame]] are important factors in some or many [[mental disorder]]s, especially disorders that involve a perceived defect of oneself (e.g. [[body dysmorphic disorder]]). Self-hatred is also a symptom of many [[personality disorder]]s, including [[borderline personality disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/tc/borderline-personality-disorder-symptoms|title=Borderline Personality Disorder - Symptoms|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. It can also be linked to guilt for someone's own actions that they view as wrongful, e.g., [[self-guilt]], [[survivor guilt]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

{{POV|talk=talk page section name|date=November 2018}}


The term self-hatred can refer to either a strong dislike for oneself, one's own actions, or a strong dislike or hatred of one's own [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[gender]], [[nationality]], [[sexual orientation]], or any other group of which one may be a member. When used in the latter context it is generally defined as hatred of one's identity based on the demographic in question, as well as a desire to distance oneself from this identity.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===Personal===
Some [[sociology]] theorists such as [[Jerry Mander]] see [[television programming]] as being deliberately designed to induce self-hatred, negative [[body image]], and [[clinical depression|depression]], with the [[advertising]] then being used to suggest the cure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turnoffyourtv.com/reviews/Jerry.Mander.html|title=Review of Jerry Mander's Four Arguments For The Elimination Of Television|last=Kaufman|first=Ron|publisher=TurnOffYourTV.com|accessdate=17 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331093742/http://www.turnoffyourtv.com/reviews/Jerry.Mander.html|archive-date=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also the arguments related to the ''[[Kill your television]]'' phenomenon. Some personal self-hatred can be linked to [[remorse]] for something a person did or did not do, or as a result of [[bullying]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

=== Jewish Community ===
Many races have faced self-hatred through the form of their own race or ethnicity. Jews are one of the prime examples that experience this type of self-hate. Jews have experienced plenty of hate from Europe and America. Also often quoted were the writings of Lessing, who, in his book, Jewish Self-Hatred (1930), considered this type of hatred pathological, “a manifestation of an over identification with the dominant culture and internalization of its prejudices.” There have been studies from sources stated in the scholarly research, “mental illness in Jews often derived from feelings of inferiority and self-hatred resulting from persecution and their subordinate position in society.” From the American Jew side, there have been similar responses as to their reactions and self-hate. European Jews migrated overseas in 1654. During that time, Jews were discriminated and banned from professions and from voting and holding office. Not until 1868 in which the original 13 colonies granted Jews the political equality. Because of this, many of the American Jews were deciding to hide their identity “by converting or intermarrying and raising their children in another faith.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alperin|first=Richard M.|date=2016-03-09|title=Jewish Self-Hatred: The Internalization of Prejudice|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10615-016-0577-2|journal=Clinical Social Work Journal|language=en|volume=44|issue=3|pages=221–230|doi=10.1007/s10615-016-0577-2|issn=0091-1674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Black Community ===
Within the Black Community, there have been those who have experienced self-hate. Society views Black Americans as inferior. Due to the racial stereotypes, Black Americans are assumed immoral, ugly, dull witted, and otherwise inferior. In addition, from their history as seen as slaves, it also counts as a reason as to why they are considered inferior to others. The self-hate portrayal of Black women is not local to the USA and no less dramatic than that of Black men. What Black women experience is conveyed to other Black women via influences of American media. As a result in severe depression. Not only that, Black men are portrayed as lazy while Black women are portrayed as sexually bold. Race category in America may have an impact on Blacks because of the status as well as history of their race, which results in self-hate for their own kind. Not only that, but skin bleaching is a common pattern because they believe their skins are “too dark” for society. On July 5, 1999, The Ministry of Health held a press conference to publicize its counter strategy to skin bleaching resulting in taking it off on all markets. By banning skin bleaching it shows a pattern that people of color are judged thus lowering their self esteem and possibly creating self-hatred. A dermatologist has estimated that about 10% to 15% of the patients seen by dermatologists are bleaching their skin. Because of the self hate Blacks have experienced through their life as well as through history, they see themselves as lower than societal needs. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charles|first=Christopher A.

=== Adolescents ===
Self-Hate is predominant in the adolescent stages. Through recent years, social media has grown and most adolescents confront their feelings online or confront their feelings about others. Digital Self Harm is the new form of self-harm in the modern day and age for adolescents. They conducted a nationally representative survey of nearly 6,000 middle and high school students. Their study, "Digital Self-Harm Among Adolescents," revealed that 6 percent of students say they have cyberbullied themselves. About 1 in 20 adolescents say they have digitally self-harmed, and almost half (48.7 percent) of those have done it more than once. Just like cutting and self-harm, which can be found under clothing, digital self-hate is harder to detect. Published in the Journal of Adolescent Health last year, Patchin and Hinduja's study also found that males were significantly more likely to report self-harming themselves than females, with 7.1 percent compared with 5.3 percent. Because of this, online media platforms have been more aware of what is happening and are beginning to put an end to it. In addition, adolescents read magazines or observe others on social media and find themselves to be out of the standard. These impossible standards make teens feel terrible about their own appearances, abilities, and accomplishments creating the unnecessary self-hate. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patchin|first=Justin W.|last2=Hinduja|first2=Sameer|date=December 2017|title=Digital Self-Harm Among Adolescents|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1054139X17303130|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=61|issue=6|pages=761–766|doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2017.06.012|issn=1054-139X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Schools See New Dilemma in Teens Who Cyberbully Themselves.” Education Week, vol. 37, no. 33, May 2018, p. 18.

==Self-injury==
[[Self-harm]] can be a psychological disorder that may involve self-hatred, where subjects may feel compelled to physically injure themselves as an outlet for depression, anxiety, or anger.&lt;ref name=Gindhu05&gt;{{citation |author=Laye-Gindhu, A. |title=Nonsuicidal Self-Harm Among Community Adolescents: Understanding the "Whats" and "Whys" of Self-Harm |journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence |volume=34 |year=2005 |pages=447–457 |doi=10.1007/s10964-005-7262-z |last2=Schonert-Reichl |first2=Kimberly A. |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klonsky07"&gt;{{citation |author=Klonsky, D. |year=2007 |title=The functions of deliberate self-injury: A review of the evidence |journal=Clinical Psychological Review |volume=27 |pages=226–239 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2006.08.002 |pmid=17014942 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Muehlenkamp05&gt;{{citation |author=Muehlenkamp, J.

In some cases, self-harm can lead to [[accidental death]] or [[suicide]]. It is not a definitive indicator, however, of a desire either to commit suicide or even of its consideration.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

== Self-deprecation ==
'''Self-deprecation''' is the act of belittling, undervaluing, or disparaging oneself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Self-deprecation | title = Self-deprecation | accessdate = 2010-06-08 | work = The Free Dictionary | publisher = Farlex}}&lt;/ref&gt; or being excessively modest.&lt;ref name= dictionary&gt;[http://personalityspirituality.net/articles/the-michael-teachings/chief-features/self-deprecation/ Self-Deprecation - Personality &amp; Spirituality&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/self-deprecation Self-deprecation | Define Self-deprecation at Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used in humor and tension release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Matthew|title=The Funny Thing About Work|publisher=Society for Intercultural Training and Research|url=http://www.sietar.org.uk/publications/articles/55-the-funny-thing-about-work|accessdate=2011-05-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120031057/http://www.sietar.org.uk/publications/articles/55-the-funny-thing-about-work|archivedate=2012-01-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-deprecation was recommended by philosophers of [[Stoicism]] as a response to insults. Instead of getting defensive, one should join in by insulting themselves even more. According to the Stoics, this will remove the sting from the insult. It will also disappoint the interlocutor because the insulted party failed to be upset, thereby reducing the chance that they will try to upset the Stoic like that again.&lt;ref&gt;William Irvine, 2013, 'A Slap in the Face'&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-deprecation is often perceived as being a characteristic of certain nations, such as in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, where "[[Vanity|blowing one's own trumpet]]" is frowned upon.&lt;ref name="Debrett's"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.debretts.com/british-etiquette/british-behaviour/r-s/self-deprecation | title=Self-Deprecation | publisher=Debrett's | accessdate=4 May 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405124627/http://www.debretts.com/british-etiquette/british-behaviour/r-s/self-deprecation | archivedate=5 April 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is played upon by English comedians such as [[David Mitchell (comedian)|David Mitchell]], [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]] and [[Johnny Vegas]].{{cn|date=January 2018}} Actors such as [[Danny Dyer]], [[Matt Lucas]], and [[Stephen Fry]] use this humour in their acting roles.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==Self-guilt==
Self-guilt is the act of feeling all the guilt on one's ownself. It can also be intentionally, putting yourself down on purpose. Self-guilt can also lead to [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and sometimes even [[suicide]].

'''Self-perception theory''' ('''SPT''') is an account of [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] formation developed by [[psychologist]] [[Daryl Bem]].&lt;ref&gt;Bem, D. J. (1967). Self-Perception: An Alternative Interpretation of Cognitive Dissonance Phenomena. Psychological Review, 74, 183-200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bem, D. J. (1972). Self-Perception Theory. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in Experimental Social Psychology (Vol. 6, pp.1-62). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It asserts that people develop their attitudes (when there is no previous attitude due to a lack of experience, etc.—and the [[emotion]]al response is ambiguous) by observing their own [[behavior]] and concluding what attitudes must have caused it. The theory is counterintuitive in nature, as the conventional wisdom is that attitudes determine behaviors. Furthermore, the theory suggests that people induce attitudes without accessing internal cognition and mood states.&lt;ref&gt;Robak, R. W., Ward, A., &amp; Ostolaza, K. (2005). Development of a General Measure of Individuals' Recognition of Their Self-Perception Processes. Psychology, 7, 337-344.&lt;/ref&gt; The person interprets their own overt behaviors rationally in the same way they attempt to explain others' behaviors.

==Bem's original experiment==
In an attempt to decide if individuals induce their attitudes as observers without accessing their internal states, Bem used interpersonal simulations, in which an "observer-participant" is given a detailed description of one condition of a [[cognitive dissonance]] experiment. Subjects listened to a tape of a man enthusiastically describing a tedious peg-turning task.

Subjects were told that the man had been paid $20 for his testimonial and another group was told that he was paid $1. Those in the latter condition thought that the man must have enjoyed the task more than those in the $20 condition. The results obtained were similar to the original [[Cognitive dissonance#Induced-compliance paradigm|Festinger-Carlsmith experiment]]. Because the observers, who did not have access to the actors' internal cognition and mood states, were able to infer the true attitude of the actors, it is possible that the actors themselves also arrive at their attitudes by observing their own behavior. Specifically, Bem notes how "the attitude statements which comprise the major dependent variables in dissonance experiments may be regarded as interpersonal judgments in which the observer and the observed happen to be the same individual."

==Further evidence==
There are numerous studies conducted by psychologists that support the [[Psychology of self|self]]-perception theory, demonstrating that emotions do follow behaviors. For example, it is found that corresponding emotions (including liking, disliking, [[happiness]], [[anger]], etc.) were reported following from their overt behaviors, which had been manipulated by the experimenters.&lt;ref&gt;Laird, J. D. (2007). Feelings: The Perceptions of Self. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors included making different [[facial expression]]s, gazes, and postures. In the end of the experiment, subjects inferred and reported their affections and attitudes from their practiced behaviors despite the fact that they were told previously to act that way. These findings are consistent with the [[James–Lange theory]] of emotion.

In 1974, James Laird conducted two experiments on how changes in facial expression can trigger changes in emotion.&lt;ref name="Laird 1974"&gt;Laird, J. D. (1974). Self-attribution of emotion: The effects of expressive behavior on the quality of emotional experience. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 29(4), 475-486. doi:10.1037/h0036125&lt;/ref&gt; Participants were asked to contract or relax various facial muscles, causing them to smile or frown without awareness of the nature of their expressions. Participants reported feeling more angry when frowning and happier when smiling. They also reported that cartoons viewed while they were smiling were more humorous than cartoons viewed while they were frowning. Furthermore, participants scored higher on aggression during frown trials than during smile trials, and scored higher on elation, surgency, and social affection factors during smile trials than during frown ones.&lt;ref name="Laird 1974" /&gt; Laird interpreted these results as "indicating that an individual's expressive behavior mediates the quality of his emotional experience."&lt;ref name="Laird 1974" /&gt; In other words, a person's facial expression can act as a cause of an emotional state, rather than an effect; instead of smiling because they feel happy, a person can make themselves feel happy by smiling.

In 2006, Tiffany Ito and her colleagues conducted two studies to investigate if changes in facial expression can trigger changes in [[Race (human categorization)|racial]] bias.&lt;ref name="Ito"&gt;Ito, T., Chiao, K., Devine, P., Lorig, T., &amp; Cacioppo, J. (2006). The Influence of Facial Feedback on Race Bias. Psychological Science, 17(3), 256-261. doi: 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01694.x&lt;/ref&gt; The explicit goal of the studies was to determine "whether facial feedback can modulate implicit racial bias as assessed by the [[Implicit-association test|Implicit Association Test]] (IAT)."&lt;ref name="Ito" /&gt; Participants were surreptitiously induced to smile through holding a pencil in their mouth while viewing photographs of unfamiliar black or white males or performed no somatic configuration while viewing the photographs (Study 1 only). All participants then completed the IAT with no facial manipulation. Results revealed a spreading attitude effect; people made to smile (unconsciously) at pictures of [[Black people|black]] males showed less implicit prejudice than those made to smile at pictures of [[White people|white]] males.&lt;ref name="Ito" /&gt; Their attitudes change as a result of their behavior.

Chaiken and Baldwin's 1981 study on self-perception theory dealt with environmental attitudes.&lt;ref name="Chaiken"&gt;Chaiken, S., &amp; Baldwin, M. W. (1981). Affective-cognitive consistency and the effect of salient behavioral information on the self-perception of attitudes. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 41(1), 1-12. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.41.1.1&lt;/ref&gt; Each participant was identified as having well or poorly defined prior attitudes toward being an [[environmentalist]] or [[Conservation movement|conservationist]]. Participants then completed one of two versions of a questionnaire designed to bring to mind either past pro-ecology behaviors or past anti-ecology behaviors.&lt;ref name="Chaiken" /&gt; For example, questions such as "Have you ever recycled?" call to mind the times an individual has recycled, emphasizing their engagement in environmentalist behavior. On the other hand, questions like "Do you always recycle?" bring to mind all the times an individual did not recycle something, emphasizing a lack of environmentalist behavior. Afterward, participants' attitudes toward being an environmentalist/conservationist were re-measured. Those with strong initial/prior attitudes toward the environment were not really affected by the salient manipulation. Those with weak prior attitudes, however, were affected. At the end, those in the pro-ecology condition ("Have you ever recycled?") reported themselves as being much more pro-environment than those in the anti-ecology condition ("Do you always recycle?").&lt;ref name="Chaiken" /&gt; Bringing to mind certain past behaviors affected what people believed their attitudes to be.

Evidence for the self-perception theory has also been seen in real life situations. After teenagers participated in repeated and sustained volunteering services, their attitudes were demonstrated to have shifted to be more caring and considerate towards others.&lt;ref&gt;Brunelle, J. P. (2001). The impact of community service on adolescent volunteers' empathy, social responsibility, and concern for others. The Sciences and Engineering, 62, 2514.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent research==
Research incorporating self-perception theory has continued in recent years, appearing in conjunction with studies dealing with [[Motivation crowding theory|motivational "crowding out,"]] [[terrorism]], [[mindwandering]], and the inclusion of others in the self.

Guadagno and her fellow experimenters did a study in 2010 addressing the recruitment of new members by terrorist organization via the internet.&lt;ref name="Guadagno"&gt;Guadagno, R. E., Lankford, A., Muscanell, N. L., Okdie, B. M., &amp; McCallum, D. M. (2010). Social influence in the online recruitment of terrorists and terrorist sympathizers: Implications for social psychology research. Revue Internationale De Psychologie Sociale, 23(1), 25-56.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to looking at how such an organization might influence its targets to support more [[Extremism|extreme ideologies]] (primarily through simple requests gradually increasing to larger commitments–an example of the [[foot-in-the-door technique]]), the authors looked at how "the new converts may form increasingly radical attitudes to be consistent with their increasingly radical behavior."&lt;ref name="Guadagno" /&gt; Self-perception theory, then, has strong ties to social identity and [[social influence]] in this scenario.

Also in 2010, Clayton Critcher and [[Thomas Gilovich]] performed four studies to test a connection between self-perception theory and mindwandering.&lt;ref name="Critcher"&gt;Critcher, C. R., &amp; Gilovich, T. (2010). Inferring attitudes from mindwandering. Personality And Social Psychology Bulletin, 36(9), 1255-1266.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-perception theory posits that people determine their attitudes and preferences by interpreting the meaning of their own behavior. Critcher and Gilovich looked at whether people also rely on the unobservable behavior that is their mindwandering when making inferences about their attitudes and preferences. They found that "Having the mind wander to positive events, to concurrent as opposed to past activities, and to many events rather than just one tends to be attributed to boredom and therefore leads to perceived dissatisfaction with an ongoing task." Participants relied on the content of their wandering minds as a cue to their attitudes unless an alternative cause for their mindwandering was brought to their attention.&lt;ref name="Critcher" /&gt;

Similarly, Goldstein and Cialdini published work related to self-perception theory in 2007.&lt;ref name="Goldstein"&gt;Goldstein, N. J., &amp; Cialdini, R. B. (2007). The spyglass self: A model of vicarious self-perception. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 92(3), 402-417.&lt;/ref&gt; In an extension of self-perception theory, the authors hypothesized that people sometimes infer their own attributes or attitudes by "observing the freely chosen actions of others with whom they feel a sense of merged identity – almost as if they had observed themselves performing the acts."&lt;ref name="Goldstein" /&gt; Participants were made to feel a sense of merged identity with an actor through a perspective-taking task or feedback indicating overlapping brainwave patterns. Participants incorporated attributes relevant to the actor's behavior into their own [[self-concept]]s, leading participants to then change their own behaviors.&lt;ref name="Goldstein" /&gt; The study addresses the [[self-expansion model]]: close relationships can lead to an inclusion of another person in an individual's sense of self.

==Applications==
One useful application of the self-perception theory is in changing attitude, both [[therapy|therapeutically]] and in terms of [[persuasion]].

===Psychological therapy===

For therapies, self-perception theory holds a different view of psychological problems from the traditional perspectives. Traditionally, psychological problems come from the inner part of the clients. However, self-perception theory perspective suggests that people derive their inner feelings or abilities from their external behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Bem, D. J. (1972). Self-perception theory. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, (6th ed.). New York, NY: Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; If those behaviors are maladjusted ones, people will attribute those maladjustments to their poor adapting abilities and thus suffer from the corresponding psychological problems. Thus, this concept can be used to treat clients with psychological problems that resulted from maladjustments by guiding them to first change their behavior and later dealing with the "problems".

One of the most famous therapies making use of this concept is therapy for "heterosocial anxiety".&lt;ref&gt;Haemmerlie, F. M., &amp; Montgomery, R. L. (1982). Self-perception theory and unobtrusively biased interactions: A treatment for heterosocial anxiety. Journal of Counseling, Psychology, 29, 362-370.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haemmerlie, F. M., &amp; Montgomery, R. L. (1984). Purposefully biased interactions: Reducing heterosocial anxiety through self-perception theory. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 47, 900-908.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the assumption is that an individual perceives that he or she has poor social skills because he/she has no dates. Experiments showed that males with heterosocial anxiety perceived less [[anxiety]] with females after several sessions of therapy in which they engaged in a 12-minute, purposefully biased dyadic social interactions with a separate females. From these apparently successful interactions, the males inferred that their heterosocial anxiety was reduced. This effect is shown to be quite long-lasting as the reduction in perceived heterosocial anxiety resulted in a significantly greater number of dates among subjects 6 months later.

===Marketing and persuasion===

Self-perception theory is also an underlying mechanism for the effectiveness of many [[marketing]] or persuasive techniques. One typical example is the foot-in-the-door technique, which is a widely used marketing technique for persuading target customers to buy products. The basic premise of this technique is that, once a person complies with a small request (e.g. filling in a short questionnaire), he/she will be more likely to comply with a more substantial request which is related to the original request (e.g. buying the related product).&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, M., &amp; Cunningham, M. R. (1975). To comply or not comply: testing the self-perception explanation of the foot-in-the-door phenomenon. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 31, 64–67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uranowitz, S. W. (1975). Helping and self-attributions: a field experiment. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 31, 852–854.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, C., Bush, M., &amp; Kirsch, K. (1976). Relationship compliance in the foot-in-the-door paradigm and size of the first request. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 33, 517–520.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burger, J. M. (1999). The foot-in-the-door compliance procedure: a multiple-process analysis and review, Personality and Social Psychology Review, 3, 303–325.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that the initial commitment on the small request will change one's [[self-image]], therefore giving reasons for agreeing with the subsequent, larger request. It is because people observe their own behaviors (paying attention to and complying with the initial request) and the context in which they behave (no obvious incentive to do so), and thus infer they must have a preference for those products.

==Challenges and criticisms==

Self-perception theory was initially proposed as an alternative to explain the experimental findings of the [[cognitive dissonance theory]], and there were debates as to whether people experience [[attitude change]]s as an effort to reduce dissonance or as a result of self-perception processes. Based on the fact that the self-perception theory differs from the cognitive dissonance theory in that it does not hold that people experience a "negative drive state" called "dissonance" which they seek to relieve, the following experiment was carried out to compare the two theories under different conditions.

An early study on cognitive dissonance theory shows that people indeed experience arousal when their behavior is inconsistent with their previous attitude. Waterman&lt;ref&gt;Waterman, C. K. (1969). The facilitating and interfering effects of cognitive dissonance on simple and complex paired associates learning tasks. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 5, 31-42.&lt;/ref&gt; designed an experiment in which 77 male college freshmen were asked to write an essay arguing against the position they actually agreed with. Then they were asked immediately to perform a simple task and a difficult task; their performance in both tasks was assessed. It was found that they performed better in the simple task and worse in the difficult task, compared to those who had just written an essay corresponding to their true attitude. As indicated by [[social facilitation]], enhanced performance in simple tasks and worsened performance in difficult tasks shows that arousal is produced by people when their behavior is inconsistent with their attitude. Therefore, the cognitive dissonance theory is evident in this case.

==Apparent disproof==
Debate ensued over whether dissonance or self-perception was the valid mechanism behind attitude change. The chief difficulty lay in finding an experiment where the two flexible theories would make distinctly different predictions. Some prominent [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] such as [[Anthony Greenwald]] thought it would be impossible to distinguish between the two theories.

In 1974, Zanna and Cooper conducted an experiment in which individuals were made to write a counter-attitudinal essay.&lt;ref name="Zanna"&gt;Zanna, M. P., &amp; Cooper, J. (1974). Dissonance and the pill: An attribution approach to studying the arousal properties of dissonance. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 29(5), 703–709. {{doi|10.1037/h0036651}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were divided into either a low choice or a high choice condition. They were also given a [[placebo]]; they were told the placebo would induce either tension, relaxation, or exert no effect. Under low choice, all participants exhibited no attitude change, which would be predicted by both cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory.&lt;ref name="Zanna" /&gt; Under high choice, participants who were told the placebo would produce tension exhibited no attitude change, and participants who were told the placebo would produce relaxation demonstrated larger attitude change.&lt;ref name="Zanna" /&gt;

These results are not explainable by self-perception theory, as arousal should have nothing to do with the mechanism underlying attitude change. Cognitive dissonance theory, however, was readily able to explain these results: if the participants could attribute their state of unpleasant arousal to the placebo, they would not have to alter their attitude.

Thus, for a period of time, it seemed the debate between the self-perception theory and cognitive dissonance had ended.

==Reviving the theory: the truce experiment==
Fazio, Zanna, and Cooper conducted another experiment in 1977, demonstrating that both cognitive dissonance and self-perception could co-exist.&lt;ref name="Fazio"&gt;Fazio, R. H., Zanna, M. P., &amp; Cooper, J. (1977). Dissonance and self-perception: An integrative view of each theory's proper domain of application. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 13(5), 464-479. doi:10.1016/0022-1031(77)90031-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In an experimental design similar to Zanna and Cooper's 1974 study, another variable was manipulated: whether or not the stance of the counter-attitudinal essay fell in the latitude of acceptance or the latitude of rejection (see [[social judgment theory]]). It appeared that when the stance of the essay fell into the latitude of rejection, the results favoured cognitive dissonance. However, when the essay fell in the latitude of acceptance, the results favoured self-perception theory.&lt;ref name="Fazio" /&gt;

Whether cognitive dissonance or self-perception is a more useful theory is a topic of considerable controversy and a large body of literature. There are some circumstances in which a certain theory is preferred, but it is traditional to use the terminology of cognitive dissonance theory by default. The cognitive dissonance theory accounts for attitude changes when people's behaviors are inconsistent with their original attitudes which are clear and important to them; meanwhile, the self-perception theory is used when those original attitudes are relatively ambiguous and less important. Studies have shown that, in contrast to traditional belief, a large proportion of people's attitudes are weak and vague. Thus, the self-perception theory is significant in interpreting one's own attitudes, such as the assessment of one's own [[personality trait]]s&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, N., Bless, H., Strack, F., Klumpp, G., Rittenauer-Schatka, &amp; Simons, A. (1991). Ease of retrieval as information: Another look at the availability heuristic. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 61, 195-202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tice, D. M. (1993). Self-concept change and self-presentation: The looking glass self is also a magnifying glass. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 63, 435-451.&lt;/ref&gt; and whether someone would cheat to achieve a goal.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstbier, R. A., &amp; Munter, P.O. (1971). Cheating as a function of the labeling of natural arousal. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 17, 208-213.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to G. Jademyr and Yojiyfus, the perception of different aspect in the interpreting theory can be due to many factors, such as circumstances regarding dissonance and controversy. This can also be because of [[balance theory]] as it applies to the attitude towards accountability and dimensions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54392">Every day, people are presented with endless amounts of information, and in an effort to help keep track and organize this information, people must be able to recognize, differentiate and store information. One way to do that is to [[information organization|organize information]] as it pertains to the self.&lt;ref name="source1"&gt;Rogers, T. B., Kuiper, N. A., &amp; Kirker, W. S. (1977). Self-reference and the encoding of personal information. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 35''(9), 677-688. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.35.9.677&lt;/ref&gt; The overall concept of [[self-reference]] suggests that people interpret incoming information in relation to themselves, using their [[self-concept]] as a background for new information.&lt;ref name = "source1" /&gt;  Examples include being able to attribute [[personality traits]] to oneself or to identify [[recollection|recollected]] episodes as being personal memories of the past.&lt;ref name="source6"&gt;Benoit, R. G., Gilbert, S. J., Volle, E., &amp; Burgess, P. W. (2010). When I think about me and simulate you: Medial rostral prefrontal cortex and self-referential processes. ''Neuroimage, 50''(3), 1340-1349. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.12.091&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of self-referential processing are evident in many psychological phenomena. For example, the "[[cocktail party effect]]" notes that people attend to the sound of their names even during other conversation or more prominent, distracting noise. Also, people tend to evaluate things related to themselves more positively (This is thought to be an aspect of [[implicit self-esteem]]). For example, people tend to prefer their [[Implicit self-esteem#Name.E2.80.93letter effect|own initials]] over other letters.&lt;ref name="source8"&gt;Heatherton, T. F., Macrae, C., &amp; Kelley, W. M. (2004). What the social brain sciences can tell us about the self. ''Current Directions in Psychological Science, 13''(5), 190-193. doi:10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00305.x&lt;/ref&gt; The [[self-reference effect]] (SRE) has received the most attention through investigations into memory. The concepts of '''self-referential encoding''' and the SRE rely on the notion that relating information to the self during the process of encoding it in memory facilitates recall, hence the effect of self-reference on memory. In essence, researchers have investigated the potential [[mnemonic]] properties of self-reference.&lt;ref name="source5"&gt;Klein, S. B., Loftus, J., &amp; Burton, H. A. (1989). Two self-reference effects: The importance of distinguishing between self-descriptiveness judgments and autobiographical retrieval in self-referent encoding. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56''(6), 853-865. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.56.6.853&lt;/ref&gt;

Research includes investigations into [[self-schema]], [[self-concept]] and [[self-awareness]] as providing the foundation for self-reference's role in [[memory]]. Multiple explanations for the self-reference effect in memory exist, leading to a debate about the underlying processes involved in the self-reference effect. In addition, through the exploration of the self-reference effect, other psychological concepts have been discovered or supported, including [[#Simulation theory|simulation theory]] and the [[#Expansion of the SRE: group reference|group reference]] effect.
After researchers developed a concrete understanding of the self-reference effect, many expanded their investigations to consider the self-reference effect in particular groups like those with [[#Autism spectrum disorder|autism spectrum disorder]]s or those experiencing [[#Depression|depression]].

==Self-concept and self-schema==
Self-knowledge can be categorized by structures in memory or [[Schema (psychology)|schemata]]. A [[self-schema]] is a set of facts or beliefs that one has about themselves.&lt;ref name="source14"&gt;Katz, A. N. (1987). Self-reference in the encoding of creative-relevant traits. ''Journal of Personality, 55''(1), 97-120. doi:10.1111/j.1467-6494.1987.tb00430.x&lt;/ref&gt; For any given trait, an individual may or may not be "schematic"; that is, the individual may or may not think about themselves as to where they stand on that trait. For example, people who think of themselves as very overweight or who identify themselves to a greater extent based on their body weight would be considered "schematic" on the attribute of body weight. Thus, many everyday events, such as going out for a meal or discussing a friend's eating habits, could induce thoughts about the self.&lt;ref&gt;Markus, H., Hamill, R., &amp; Sentis, K. P. (1987). Thinking fat: Self-schemas for body weight and the processing of weight relevant information. ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology'', ''17''(1), 50-71. doi:10.1111/j.1559-1816.1987.tb00292.x&lt;/ref&gt; When people relate information to something that has to do with the self, it facilitates memory.&lt;ref name = "source15"&gt;Klein, S. B., Loftus, J., &amp; Burton, H. A. (1989). Two self-reference effects: The importance of distinguishing between self-descriptiveness judgments and autobiographical retrieval in self-referent encoding. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56(6), 853-865. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.56.6.8533&lt;/ref&gt; Self-descriptive adjectives that fit into one's self-schema are easier to remember than adjectives not viewed as related to the self. Thus, the self-schema is an aspect of oneself that is used as an encoding structure that brings upon memory of information consistent with one's self-schema.&lt;ref name="source16"&gt;Mills, C. J. (1983). Sex-typing and self-schemata effects on memory and response latency. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 45''(1), 163-172. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.45.1.163&lt;/ref&gt; Memories that are elaborate and well encoded are usually the result of self-referent correlations during the process of remembering. During the process of encoding, trait representations are encoded in long term memory either directly or indirectly. When they are directly encoded, it is in terms of relating to the self, and when it is indirectly encoded it is done through spouts of episodic information instead of information about the self.&lt;ref name = "source14"/&gt;

Self-schema is often used as somewhat of a database for encoding personal data.&lt;ref name = "source13"/&gt; The self-schema is also used by paying selective attention to outside information and internalizing that information more deeply in one's memory depending on how much that information relates to their schema.&lt;ref name = "source12"/&gt; When self-schema is engaged, traits that go along with one's view of themselves are better remembered and [[Recall (memory)|recalled]].  These traits are also often recalled much better when processed with respect to the self. Similarly, items that are encoded with the self are based on one's self-schema.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; Processing the information should balance out when recalled for individuals who have a self-schema that goes along with the information.&lt;ref name = "source16"/&gt;

Self-schemas do not necessarily only involve individual traits. People self-categorize at different levels that range from more personal to more social. Self-schemas have three main categories which play a role: the personal self, the relational self, and the collective self. The personal self deals with individual level characteristics, the relational self deals with intimate relationship partners, and the collective self deals with group identities, relating to self-important social groups to which one belongs (e.g., one's family or university).&lt;ref name="source31"&gt;Johnson, C., Gadon, O., Carlson, D., Southwick, S., Faith, M., &amp; Chalfin, J. (2002). Self-reference and group membership: Evidence for a group-reference effect. ''European Journal of Social Psychology, 32''(2), 261-274. doi:10.1002/ejsp.83&lt;/ref&gt; Information that is related to any type of self-schema, including group-related knowledge structures facilitates memory.

In order for the self to be an effective encoding mechanism, it must be a uniform, consistent, well-developed schema. It has been shown that identity exploration leads to the development of self-knowledge which facilitates self-judgments. Identity exploration led to shorter decision times, higher confidence ratings and more intrusions in memory tasks.&lt;ref name="ego"&gt;Dunkel, C. S. (2005). Ego-identity and the Processing of Self-relevant Information . Self and Identity, 349-359&lt;/ref&gt; Previous researchers hypothesized that words compatible with a person's self-schema are easily accessible in memory and are more likely than incompatible words to intrude on a schema-irrelevant memory task. In one experiment, when participants were asked to decide if certain adjectives were "like me" or "not like me," they made the decisions faster when the words were compatible with their self-schema.&lt;ref name="behavior"&gt;&lt;div&gt;Strube, M., Berry, J. M., Lott, C., Fogelman, R., Steinhart, G., Moergen, S., &amp; Davison, L. (1986). Self-schematic representation of the Type A and B behavior patterns. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', ''51''(1), 170-180. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.51.1.170&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite the existence of the self-reference effect when considering schemata consistent adjectives, the connection between the self and memory can lead to a larger number of mistakes in recognition, commonly referred to as false alarms. Rogers et al. (1979) found that people are more likely to falsely recognize adjectives they had previously designated to be self-descriptive.&lt;ref name = "ego"/&gt; Expanding on this, Strube et al. (1986) found that false alarms occurred more for self-schema consistent content, presumably because the presence of such words in the schema makes them more accessible in memory.&lt;ref name = "behavior"/&gt;

In addition to investigating the self-reference effect in regards to schemata consistent information, Strube et al. discussed how counter schemata information relates to this framework. They noted that the pattern of making correct decisions more rapidly did not hold when considering words that countered a person's self-schema, presumably because they were difficult to integrate into memory due to lack of a preexisting structure.&lt;ref name = "behavior"/&gt; That is, they lacked the organizational structure of encoding because they did not fall into the "like me" category, and elaboration would not work because prior connections to the adjective did not exist.

===Self-awareness and personality===
Two of the most common functions of the self receiving significant attention in research are the self-acting to organize the individual's understanding of the social environment, and the self functioning to regulate behavior through self-evaluation.&lt;ref name="hull"&gt;Hull, J. G., &amp; Levy, A. S. (1979). The organizational functions of the self: An alternative to the Duval and Wicklund Model of self-awareness. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37''(5), 756-768. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.37.5.756&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of self-awareness is considered to be the foundational principle for both functions of the self. Some research presents self-awareness in terms of self-focused attention &lt;ref&gt;Duval, S., &amp; Wicklund, R. A. (1972). ''A theory of objective self-awareness.'' New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Hull and Levy suggest that self-awareness refers to the encoding of information based on its relevance to the self.&lt;ref name = "hull"/&gt; Based on the latter interpretation of self-awareness, individuals must identify the aspects of situations that are relevant to themselves and their behavior will be shaped accordingly.&lt;ref name = "hull"/&gt; Hull and Levy suggest that self-awareness corresponds to the encoding of information cued by self-symbolic stimuli, and examine the idea of self-awareness as a method of encoding. They structured an investigation that examined self-referent encoding in individuals with different levels of self-awareness, predicting that individuals with higher levels of self-consciousness would encode self-relevant information more deeply than other information, and that they would encode it more deeply than individuals with low levels of self-consciousness.&lt;ref name = "hull"/&gt; The results of their investigation supported their hypothesis that self-focused attention is not enough to explain the role of self-awareness on attribution. Their results suggest that self-awareness leads to increased sensitivity to the situationally defined meanings of behavior, and therefore organizes the individual's understanding of the social environment.&lt;ref name = "hull"/&gt; The research presented by Hull and Levy led to future research on the encoding of information associated with self-awareness.

In later research, Hull and colleagues examined the associations between self-referential encoding, self-consciousness and the extent to which a stimulus is consistent with self-knowledge. They first assumed that the encoding of a stimulus is facilitated if an individual's working memory already contains information consistent with the stimulus, and suggested that self-consciousness as an encoding mechanism relies on an individual's self-knowledge.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;Hull, J. G., Van Treuren, R. R., Ashford, S. J., Propsom, P., &amp; Andrus, B. W. (1988). Self-consciousness and the processing of self-relevant information. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 54''(3), 452-465. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.54.3.452&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that situational and dispositional factors may activate certain pools of knowledge, moving them into working memory, and guiding the processing of certain stimulus information.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;

In order to better understand the idea of activating information in memory, Hull et al. presented an example of how information is activated. They referred to the sentence "The robber took the money from the bank".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R. (1983). ''The architecture of cognition.'' Cambridge. MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In English, the word bank has two applicable meanings in the context of this sentence (monetary institution and river shore). However, the monetary institution meaning of the word is more highly activated in this context due to the addition of the words robber and money to the sentence, because they are associatively relevant and therefore pull the monetary institution definition for bank into working memory.  Once information is added to working memory, meanings and associations are more easily drawn. Therefore, the meaning of this example sentence is almost universally understood.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;

In reference to self-consciousness and self-reference, the connection between self-consciousness and self-referent encoding relies on such information activation. Research suggests that self-consciousness activates knowledge relating to the self, thereby guiding the processing of self-relevant information.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt; Three experiments conducted by Hull and colleagues provided evidence that a manipulation of accessible self-knowledge impacts self-referent encoding based on the self-relevance of such information, individual differences in the accessibility of self-knowledge (self-consciousness) impacts perception, and a mediation relationship exists between self-consciousness and individual differences in self-referential encoding.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;

Similar to how self-awareness impacts the availability of self-knowledge and the encoding of self-relevant information, through the development of the self-schema, people develop and maintain certain personality characteristics leading to a variety of behavior patterns. Research has been done on the differences between [[Type A and Type B personality theory|Type A and Type B behavior patterns]], focusing on how people in each group respond to environmental information and their interpretation of the performance of others and themselves. It has been found that Type A behavior is characterized by competitive achievement striving, time urgency and hostility, whereas Type B is usually defined as an absence of Type A characteristics. When investigating causal attributions for hypothetical positive and negative outcomes, Strube et al. found that Type A individuals were more self-serving, in that they took greater responsibility for positive than negative effects. Strube and colleagues argued that this could be a result of the fact that schema-consistent information is more easily remembered and the ease with which past successes and failures are recalled, determined by self-schema, would impact attributions. It is reasonable to believe that Type A's might recall successes more easily and hence be more self-serving.&lt;ref name = "behavior"/&gt;

==Theoretical background==
Influential psychologists [[Fergus Craik|Craik]] and Lockhart laid the groundwork for research focused on self-referential encoding and memory. In 1972 they proposed their Depth of Processing framework which suggests that memory retention depends on how the stimulus material was encoded in memory.&lt;ref&gt;Craik, F. I. M., &amp; Lockhart, R. S. (1972).'' ''Levels of processing: A framework for memory research. ''Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 11''(6), 671-684. [[doi:10.1016/S0022-5371(72)80001-X|doi: 10.1016/S0022-5371(72)80001-X]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="source2"&gt;Klein, S. B., &amp; Kihlstrom, J. F. (1986). Elaboration, organization, and the self-reference effect in memory. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 115''(1), 26-38. doi:10.1037/0096-3445.115.1.26&lt;/ref&gt; Their original research considered structural, phonemic, and [[Semantic memory|semantic]] encoding tasks, and showed that semantic encoding is the best method to aid in recall. They asked participants to rate 40 descriptive [[adjectives]] on one of four tasks; Structural (Big font or small font?), Phonemic (Rhymes with xxx?), Semantic (Means same as xxx?), or Self-reference (Describes you?). This was then followed by an "incidental recall task". This is where participants are asked, without prior warning, to recall as many of the words they had seen as possible within a given time limit. Craik and Tulving's original experiment showed that structural and [[phonemic]] tasks lead only to "shallow" encoding, while the semantic tasks lead to "deep" encoding and resulted in better recall.&lt;ref&gt;Craik F., &amp; Tulving, E. (1975). Depth of processing and the retention of words in episodic memory. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 104,'' 268-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1977, it was shown that self-relevant or self-descriptive encoding leads to even better recall than semantic tasks.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt; Experts suggest that the call on [[Association (psychology)|associative]] [[memory]] required by semantic tasks is what provides the advantage over structural or phonemic tasks, but is not enough to surpass the benefit provided by self-referential encoding.&lt;ref name = "source1"/&gt; The fact that self-reference was shown to be a stronger memory encoding method than semantic tasks is what led to more significant interest in the field &lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; One early and significant experiment aimed to place self-reference on Craik and Lockhart's depth of processing hierarchy, and suggested that self-reference was a more beneficial encoding method than semantic tasks. In this experiment, participants filled out self-ratings on 84 adjectives. Months later, these participants were revisited and were randomly shown 42 of those words. They then had to select the group of 42 "revisited" words out of the total original list. The researchers argued that if the "self" was involved in memory retrieval, participants would incorrectly recognize words that were more self-descriptive &lt;ref name = "source1"/&gt; In another experiment, subjects answered yes or no to cue questions about 40 adjective in 4 tasks (structural, phonemic, semantic and self-referential) and later had to recall the adjectives. This experiment validated the strength of self-reference as an encoding method, and indicated it developed a stronger memory trace than the semantic task.&lt;ref name = "source1"/&gt;

Researchers are implementing a new strategy by developing different encoding tasks that enhance memory very similarly to self-referential encoding.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt;  Symons (1990) had findings that went against the norm when he was unable to find evidence of self-schematicity in the self-reference effect.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt;  Another finding was that when referencing gender and religion, there was a low memory recall when compared with referencing the self. A [[meta-analysis]] by Symons and Johnson (1997) showed self-reference resulting in better memory in comparison to tasks relying on [[Semantic memory|semantic]] encoding or other-referent encoding. According to Symons and Johnson, self-referencing questions elicit elaboration and organization in memory, both of which creating a deeper encoding and thus facilitate memory.&lt;ref name="source4" /&gt;

Theorists that favor the view that the self has a special role believe that the self leads to more in depth processing, leading to easier recall during self-reference tasks.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; Theorists also promote the self-schema as being one of the sole inhibitors that allow for recall from deep memory.&lt;ref name = "source13"/&gt; Thorndyke and Hayes-Roth had the goal of focusing on the process made by the active memory schemata.&lt;ref&gt;Thorndyke, P. W., &amp; Hayes-Roth, B. (1979). The use schemata in the acquisition and transfer of knowledge.'' Cognitive Psychology, 11''(1), 82-106. [[doi: 10.1016/0010-0285(79)90005-7]]&lt;/ref&gt; Sex-typed individuals recall trait adjectives that go along with their sex role more quickly than trait adjectives that are not. During the process of free recall, these individuals also showed more patterns for gender clustering than other sexually typed individuals.&lt;ref name="source16" /&gt;

==Types of self-referential encoding tasks==
As research on self-referential encoding became more prolific, some psychologists took an opportunity to delineate specific self-referential encoding tasks. It is noted that descriptive tasks are those that require participants to determine if a stimulus word can be classified as "self-descriptive." Autobiographical tasks are those that require participants to use the stimulus word as a cue to recall an autobiographical memory. Results from experiments that differentiated between these types of self-referential encoding found that they both produced better recall than semantic tasks, and neither was more advantageous than the other. However, research does suggest that the two types of self-referential encoding do rely on different processes to facilitate memory.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; In most experiments discussed, these types of self- referential encoding were not differentiated.

In a typical self-reference task, adjectives are presented and classified as either self-descriptive or not.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; For example, in a study by Dobson and Shaw, adjectives about the self that were preselected were given to the participants and they decide whether or not the adjectives are self-descriptive.&lt;ref name="source12" /&gt;  The basis for making certain judgments, decisions, inferences and decisions is a self-referent encoding task. If two items are classified as self-descriptive there is no reason one trait would not be equally as easy to retrieve as the other on a self-reference task.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt;

==Explanations for the self-reference effect==
While a significant amount of research supports the existence of the self-reference effect, the processes behind it are not well understood. However, multiple hypotheses have been introduced, and two main arguments have been developed: the elaborative processing hypothesis and the organizational processing hypothesis.&lt;ref name="source3"&gt;Klein, S. B., &amp; Loftus, J. (1988). The nature of self-referent encoding: The contributions of elaborative and organizational processes. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 55''(1), 5-11. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.55.1.5&lt;/ref&gt; Encodings in reference to the self are so elaborate because of the information one has about the self.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt; Information encoded with the self is better remembered than information encoded with reference to something else.&lt;ref name="source34"&gt;Bennett, M., Allan, S., Anderson, J., &amp; Asker, N. (2010). On the robustness of the group reference effect. European Journal of Social Psychology, 40(2), 349-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elaboration===
Elaboration refers to the encoding of a single word by forming connections between it and other material already stored in memory.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt; By creating these connections between the stimulus word and other material already in memory, multiple routes for retrieval of the stimulus word are formed.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; Based on the depth of processing framework, memory retention increases as elaboration during encoding increases.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt; The Elaborative Processing Hypothesis would suggest that any encoding task that leads to the development of the most trace elaboration or associations is the best for memory retention. Additional research on the depth of processing hierarchy suggests that self-reference is the superior method of information encoding. The elaborative hypothesis would suggest this is because self-reference creates the most elaborate trace,&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; due to the many links that can be made between the stimulus and information about the self already in memory.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt;

===Organization===
The organizational processing hypothesis was proposed by Klein and Kihlstrom.&lt;ref name="source2" /&gt; This hypothesis suggests that encoding is best prompted by considering stimulus words in relation to one another. This thought process and relational thinking creates word to word associations.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; These inter-item associations are paths in memory that can be used during retrieval. Also, the category labels that define the relations between stimulus items can be used as item cues. Evidence of the organizational component of encoding is demonstrated through the clustering of words during recall.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; Word clustering during recall indicates that relational information was used to store the words in memory. Rogers, Kuiper and Kirker showed that self-referential judgments were more likely to encourage organization than semantic ones.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; Therefore, they suggested the self-reference effect was likely due to the organizational processing endured by self-referential encoding.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt;

Structural, phonemic and semantic tasks within the depth of processing paradigm require words to be considered individually, and lend themselves to an elaborative approach. As such, it can be argued that self-referential encoding is superior because it leads to an indirect division of words into categories: words that describe me versus words that do not.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt; Due to this connection between self-reference and organizational processing, further research has been done on this area. Klein and Kihlstrom's research suggests first that, like previous research, self-reference led to better recall than semantic and structural encoding. Second, they found that self-referentially encoded words were more clustered in recall than words from other tasks, suggesting higher levels of organizational processing. From this they concluded that the organization, not encoding task, is what makes self-referential encoding superior &lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt;

===Dual process===
Psychologists Einstein and Hunt showed that both elaborative processing and organizational processing facilitate recall. However, their research argues that the effectiveness of either approach depends on how related the stimulus words are to one another. A list of highly related stimulus words would be better encoded using the elaborative method. The relations between the words would be evident to subjects; therefore, they would not gain any additional pathways for retrieval by encoding the words based on their categorical membership. Instead, the other information gained through elaborative processing would be more beneficial. On the other hand, a list of stimulus words with little relation would be better stored to memory through the organizational method. Since the words have no obvious connection to one another, subjects would likely encode them individually, using an elaborative approach. Since relational information wouldn't be readily detected, focusing on it would add to memory by creating new traces for retrieval.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, G. O., &amp; Hunt, R. R. (1980). Levels of processing and organization: Additive effects of individual item and relational processing. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory'',''6'', 588-598.&lt;/ref&gt; Superior recall was better explained by a combination of elaboration and organization.
 
Ultimately, the exact processes behind self-referential encoding that makes it superior to other encoding tasks are still under debate. Research suggests that if elaborative processing is behind self-referential encoding, a self-referential task should have the same effect as an elaborative task, whereas if organizational processing underlies the self-reference effect self-referential encoding tasks should function like organizational tasks.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; To test this, Klein and Loftus ran a 3x2 study testing organizational, elaborative and self-referential encoding with lists of 30 related or unrelated words. When participants were asked to memorize the unrelated list, recall and clustering were higher for the organizational task, which produced almost equal results to the self-referential task, suggesting that has an organizational basis. For the list of related words, the elaborative task led to better recall and had matched results to the self-reference task, suggesting an elaborative basis. This research, then, suggests that the self-reference effect cannot be explained by a single type of processing.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; Instead, self-referential encoding must lead to information in memory that incorporates item specific and relational information.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt;

Overall, the SRE relies on the unique mnemonic aspects of the self. Ultimately, if the research is suggesting that the self has superior elaborative or organizational properties, information related to the self should be more easily remembered and recalled.&lt;ref name="source4"&gt;Symons, C. S., &amp; Johnson, B. T. (1997). The self-reference effect in memory: A meta-analysis. ''Psychological Bulletin, 121''(3), 371-394. doi:10.1037/0033-2909.121.3.371&lt;/ref&gt; The research presented suggests that self-referential encoding is superior because it promotes organization and elaboration simultaneously, and provides self-relevant categories that promote recall.&lt;ref name = "source4"/&gt;

==Social brain science==
The field of social brain science is aimed at examining the neural foundations of social behavior.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt; Neuroimaging and neuropsychology have led to the examination of neuroanatomy and its connection to psychological topics.&lt;ref name="source7"&gt;Mitchell, J. P., Banaji, M. R., &amp; Macrae, C. (2005). The Link between social cognition and self-referential thought in the medial prefrontal cortex. ''Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 17''(8), 1306-1315. doi:10.1162/0898929055002418&lt;/ref&gt; Through this research, neuropsychologists have found a connection between social cognitive functioning and the medial [[prefrontal cortex]] (mPFC). In addition, the mPFC has been connected to reflection and introspection about personal mental states.&lt;ref name = "source7"/&gt; Supporting these findings, it has been shown that damage to the mPFC is connected to impairments with self-reflection, introspection and daydreaming, as well as social competence, but not other areas of functioning.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt; As such, the mPFC has been connected to self-referential processing.&lt;ref name = "source6"/&gt;

The research discussed by those focusing on the neuroanatomy of self-referential processing included similar tasks to the memory and depth of processing research discussed previously. When participants were asked to judge adjectives based in whether or not they were self-descriptive, it was noted that the more self-relevant the trait, the stronger the activation of the mPFC. In addition, it was shown that the mPFC was activated during the appraisal of one's own personality traits, as well as during trait retrieval.&lt;ref name = "source6"/&gt; One study showed that the more activity in the mPFC during self-referential judgments, the more likely the word was to be remembered on a subsequent surprise memory test. These results suggest that the mPFC is involved in both self-referential processing and in creating self-relevant memories.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt;

Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activation occurs during processing of self-relevant information.&lt;ref name="source33"&gt;Moran, J. M., Macrae, C. N., Heatherton, T. F., Wyland, C. L., &amp; Kelley, W. M. (2006). Neuroanatomical evidence for distinct cognitive and affective components of self. ''Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 18''(9), 1586-1594. doi:10.1162/jocn.2006.18.9.1586&lt;/ref&gt; When self-referent judgment is more relatable and less negative, the mFPC is activated. Finding support clear cut circuits that have high levels of activation when cognitive and emotional aspects of self-reflection are present.&lt;ref name = "source33"/&gt; The [[caudate nucleus]] has not been associated with self-reference before, however, Fossati and colleagues found activity while participants were retrieving self-relevant trait adjectives.&lt;ref&gt;Fossati, P., Hevenor, S. J., Lepage, M., Graham, S. J., Grady, C., Keightley, M. L., et al. (2004). Distributed self in episodic memory: Neural correlates of successful retrieval of self-encoded positive and negative personality traits. ''Neuroimage, 22''(4), 1596-1604. [[doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.03.034|doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.03.034]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "source33"/&gt; The ventral [[Cingulate cortex#Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate cortex]] (vACC) is also a part of the brain that becomes activated when there are signs of self-referencing and processing. The vACC is activated when self-descriptive information is negative.&lt;ref name = "source33"/&gt; There is also pCC ([[posterior cingulate cortex]]) activity seen in neuroimaging studies during self-referential processing.&lt;ref name = "source33"/&gt;

===Depth of processing or cognitive structure===
Given all of the neurological support for the effect of self-reference on encoding and memory, there is still a debate in the psychological community about whether or not the self-reference effect signifies a special functional role played by the self in cognition. Generally, this question is met by people that have two opposing views on the processes behind self-reference. On one side of the debate, people believe that the self has special mnemonic abilities because it is a unique cognitive structure. On the other side, people support the arguments described above that suggest there is no special structure, but instead, the self-reference effect is simply a part of the standard depth of processing hierarchy. Since the overall hypothesis is the same for both sides of the debate, that self-relevant material leads to enhanced memory, it is difficult to test them using strictly behavioral measures. Therefore, PET and fMRI scans have been used to see the neural marker of self-referential mental activity.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt;

Previous studies have shown that areas of the left prefrontal cortex are activated during semantic encoding. Therefore, if the self-reference effect works the same way, as part of the depth of processing hierarchy, the same brain region should be activated when judging traits related to the self. However, if the self has unique mnemonic properties, then self-referential tasks should activate brain regions distinct from those activated during semantic tasks.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt; The field is still at is infancy, but future work on this hypothesis might help to settle the debate about the underlying processes of self-referential encoding.

===Simulation theory===
While not able to completely settle the debate over the foundation of self-referential processing, studies on the neurological aspect of personality trait judgments did lead to a related, significant result. It has been shown that judging personality traits about oneself and a close friend activated overlapping brain regions, and the activated regions have all been implicated in self-reference. Noting the similarity between making self-judgments and judgments about close others led to the introduction of the [[simulation theory of empathy]]. Simulation theory rests on the idea that one can make inferences about others by using the knowledge they have about themselves.&lt;ref name = "source6"/&gt; In essence, the theory suggests that people use self-reflection to understand or predict the mental state of others.&lt;ref name = "source7"/&gt; The more similar a person perceives another to be, the more active the mPFC has shown to be, suggesting more deep or intricate self-reference.&lt;ref name = "source6"/&gt; However, this effect can cause people to make inaccurate judgments about others or to believe that their own opinions are representative of others in general. This misrepresentation is referred to as the [[false-consensus effect]].&lt;ref name = "source7"/&gt;

==Expansion of the SRE: group reference==
In addition to simulation theory, other expansions of the self-reference effect have been examined. Through studying the self, researchers have found that the self consists of many independent cognitive representations. For example, the personal self composed of individual characteristics is separate from the relational self which is based on relationships with significant others. These two forms of self are again separate from the collective self which corresponds to a particular group identity.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer M. B. ,&amp; Gardner, W. (1996). Who is this 'We'? Levels of collective identity and self representations. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 71'', 83–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting the existence of the collective self and the different group identities that combine to form such a self-representation led researchers to question if information stored in reference to a social group identity has the same effects in memory as information stored in reference to the individual self. In essence, researchers questioned if the self-reference effect can be extended to include situations where the self is more socially defined, producing a group-reference effect.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;

Previous research supports the idea that the group-reference effect should exist from a theoretical standpoint. First, the self-expansion model argues that individuals incorporate characteristics of their significant others (or other in-group members &lt;ref&gt;Wright, S.C., Aron A., McLaughlin-Volpe, T., &amp; Ropp, S. A. (1997). The extended contact effect: Knowledge of cross-group friendships and prejudice. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73'', 73–90.&lt;/ref&gt; into the development of their self-concept.&lt;ref&gt;Aron, A., Aron, E., Tudor, M., &amp; Nelson, G. (1991). Close relationships as including other and self. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60'', 241–253.&lt;/ref&gt; From this model, it is reasonable to conclude that characteristics that are common to both oneself and their significant others (or in-group members) would be more accessible.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt; Second, the previous research discussed suggests that the self-reference effect is due to some combination of organizational, elaborative, mental cueing or evaluative properties of self-referential encoding tasks. Given that we have significant stores of knowledge about our social identities, and such collective identities provide an organizational framework, it is reasonable to assume that a group-reference task would operate similar to that of a self-reference task.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;

In order to test these claims, Johnson and colleagues aimed to test whether the self-reference effect generalized to group level identities. Their first study was structured to simply assess if group-reference influenced subsequent memory. In their experiment, they used membership at a particular university as the group of reference. They included group-reference, self-reference and semantic tasks. The experiment replicated the self-reference effect, consistent with previous research. In addition, evidence for a group-reference effect was found.  Group-referenced encoding produced better recall than the semantic tasks, and the level of recall from the group-referenced task was not significantly different from the self-referenced task.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;

Despite finding evidence of a group-reference effect, Johnson and colleagues pointed out that people identify with numerous groups, each with unique characteristics. Therefore, in order to reach conclusive evidence of a group-reference effect, alternative group targets need to be considered. In a second experiment by Johnson et al., the group of reference was modified to be the family of the individual. This group has fewer exemplars than the pool of university students, and affective considerations of the family as a group should be strong. No specific instructions or definitions were provided for family, allowing individuals to consider either the group as a whole (prototype) or specific exemplars (group). When the experiment was repeated using family as the group of reference, group-reference produced recall as much as self-reference. The mean number of recall for the group-reference was higher than self-reference.  Participants indicated that they considered both the prototype and individual exemplars when responding to the questions, suggesting that the magnitude of the group-reference effect might not be dependent on the number of exemplars in the target group.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;
 
Both experiments presented by Johnson et al. found evidence for the group-reference effect. However, these conclusions are limited to the target groups of university students and family. Other research included gender (males and females) and religion (Jewish) as the reference groups and the group-reference effect on memory was not as evident. The group-reference recall for these two groups was not significantly more advantageous than the semantic task. Questioning what characteristics of reference groups that lead to the group-reference effect, a meta-analysis of all four group-reference conditions was performed. This analysis found that self-reference emerged as the most powerful encoding device; however, evidence was found to support the existence of a group-reference effect. The size of the reference groups and number of specific, individual exemplars was hypothesized to influence the existence of the group-reference effect. In addition, accessibility and level of knowledge about group members may also impact such an effect. So, while university students is a much larger group than family, individual exemplars may be more readily accessible than those in a religious group. Similarly, different cognitive representations were hypothesized to influence the group-reference effect. When a larger group is considered, people may be more likely to consider a prototype which may lead to fewer elaborations and cues later on. Smaller groups may lead to relying on the prototype and specific exemplars.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt; Finally, desirability judgments that influence later processing may be influenced by self-reference and certain group-reference tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, T. J., Rule, G. R., &amp; Carlson, D. (1983). Memory for personally relevant information. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 44'', 251–261.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals may be more sensitive to evaluative implications for the personal self and some group identities, but not others.&lt;ref&gt;Gaertner, L., Sedikides, C., &amp; Graetz, K. (1999). In search of self-definition: Motivational primacy of the individual self, motivational primacy of the collective self, or contextual primacy? ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 76'', 5–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups are also a major part of the self; therefore we attribute the role that different groups play in our self-concept also play a role in the self-reference effect.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt;  We process information about group members similarly to how we process for ourselves.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt; Recall of remarks referencing our home and our self and group to familiarity of those aspects of our self.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt; Reference to the self and social group and the identity that comes along with being a part of a social group are equally affective for memory.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt; This is especially true when the groups are small, rather than large.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt;

Ultimately, the group-reference effect provides evidence to explain the tendency to notice or pay attention to and remember statements made in regard to our home when traveling in a foreign place.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt; Considering the proposal that groups form part of the self, this phenomenon can be considered an extension of the self-reference effect. Similar to the memorable nature of references to a person's individual self, references to social identities are seemed to be privileged in memory as well.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;

==Applications==
Once the foundation of research on self-referential encoding was established, psychologists began to explore how the concept applied to different groups of people, and connected to different phenomena.

===Autism spectrum disorder===
Individuals diagnosed with [[autism spectrum]] disorders (ASDs) can display a wide range of symptoms.  Some of the most common characteristics of individuals with ASDs include impairments with social functioning, language and communication difficulties, repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. In addition, it is often noted that these individuals are more "self-focused." That is, they have difficulty seeing things from another's perspective.&lt;ref name="source10"&gt;Lombardo, M. V., Barnes, J. L., Wheelwright, S. J., Cohen-Baron, S. (2007). Self-referential cognition and empathy in autism. ''PLoS ONE, 2''(9), e883. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000883&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being self-focused, though, research has shown that individuals with ASD's often have difficulty identifying or describing their emotions or the emotions of others. When asked to describe their daily experiences, responses from individuals on the autism spectrum tended to focus more on physical descriptions rather than mental and emotional states. In regards to their social interactions and behavior differences, it is thought that these individuals lack top down control, and therefore, their bottom up decisions remain unchecked. This simply suggests that these individuals cannot use their prior knowledge and memory to make sense of new input, but instead react to each new input individually, compiling them to make a whole picture &lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt;

Noting the difficulty individuals with ASDs experience with [[self-awareness]], it was thought that they might have difficulty with self-related memory processes.&lt;ref name="source9"&gt;Henderson, H. A., Zahka, N. E., Kojkowski, N. M., Inge, A. P., Schwartz, C. B., Hileman, C. M., &amp; ... Mundy, P. C. (2009). Self-referenced memory, social cognition, and symptom presentation in autism. ''Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 50''(7), 853-861. doi:10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02059.x&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists questioned if these individuals would show the typical self-reference effect in memory.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt; In one Depth of Processing Study, participants were asked questions about the descriptiveness of certain stimulus words. However, unlike previous DOP studies that focused on phonemic, structural, semantic and self-referential tasks, the tasks were altered for this experiment. To test the referential abilities of individuals with ASD's, the encoding tasks were divided into: "the self," asking to what extent a stimulus word described oneself, "similar close other," asking to what extent a stimulus word was descriptive of one's best friend, "dissimilar non-close other," asking to what extent a stimulus word was descriptive of Harry Potter, and a control group that was asked to determine the number of syllables in each word. Following these encoding tasks, participants were given thirty minutes before a surprise memory task. It was found that individuals with ASD's had no impairment in memory for words encoded in the syllable or dissimilar non-close other condition. However, they had decreased memory for words related to the self.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt;

Therefore, while research suggests that self-referentially encoded information is encoded more deeply than other information, the research on individuals with ASD's showed no advantage for memory recognition with self-reference tasks over semantic encoding tasks. This suggests that individuals with ASD's don't preferentially encode self-relevant information. Psychologists have investigated the biological basis for the decreased self-reference effect among individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders and have suggested that it may be due to less specialized neural activity in the mPFC for those individuals.&lt;ref name = "source9"/&gt; However, while individuals with ASD's showed smaller self-reference effects than the control group, some evidence of a self-reference effect was evident in some cases. This indicates that self-referent impairments are a matter of degree, not total absence.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt;

Lombardo and his colleagues measured empathy among individuals with ASD's, and showed that these individuals scored lower than the control group on all empathy measures.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt; This may be a result of the difficulty for these individuals to understand or take the perspective of others, in conjunction with their difficulty identifying emotions. This has implications for simulation theory, because these individuals are unable to use their self-knowledge to make conclusions about similar others.

Ultimately, the research suggests that people with ASD's might benefit from being more self-focused. The better their ability to reflect on themselves, the better the can [[mentalization|mentalize]] with others.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt;

===Depression===
There are three possible relations between cognitive processes and  [[anxiety]] and [[depression (mood)|depression]]. The first is whether cognitive processes are actually caused by the onset of clinically diagnosed symptoms of [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]] or just generalized sadness or anxiousness. The second is whether emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety are able to be considered as caused by cognitions. And the third is whether different specific cognitive processes are able to be considered associates of different disorders.&lt;ref name="source11"&gt;Strauman, T. J. (1989). Self-discrepancies in clinical depression and social phobia: Cognitive structures that underlie emotional disorders?. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 98''(1), 14-22. doi:10.1037/0021-843X.98.1.14&lt;/ref&gt; Kovacs and Beck (1977) posited a schematic model of depression where an already depressed self was primed by outside prompts that negatively impacted cognitive illusions of the world in the eye of oneself. These prompts only led participants to a more depressive series of emotions and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Kovacs, M., &amp; Beck, A. T. (1977). Cognitive-affective processes in depression. In C. E. Izard (Ed.), ''Emotions and psychopathology'' (pp.79-107). New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The results from the study done by Derry and Kuiper supported Beck's theory that a negative self-schema is present in people, especially those with depressive disorder.&lt;ref name="source13" /&gt; Depressed individuals attribute depressive adjectives to themselves more than nondepressive adjectives.&lt;ref name="source12"&gt;Dobson, K. S., &amp; Shaw, B. F. (1987). Specificity and stability of self-referent encoding in clinical depression. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 96''(1), 34-40. doi:10.1037/0021-843X.96.1.34&lt;/ref&gt; Those suffering from a more mild case of depression have trouble deciphering between the traits of themselves and others which results in a loss of their self-esteem and their negative self-evaluation. A depressive schema is what causes the negativity reported by those suffering from depression.&lt;ref name="source13"&gt;Kuiper, N. A., &amp; Derry, P. A. (1982). Depressed and nondepressed content self-reference in mild depressives. ''Journal of Personality, 50''(1), 67-80. doi:10.1111/j.1467-6494.1982.tb00746.x&lt;/ref&gt; Kuiper and Derry found that self-referent recall enhancement was limited only to nondepressed content.&lt;ref name = "source13"/&gt;

Generally, self-focus is association with negative emotions. In particular private self-focus is more strongly associated with depression than public self-focus.&lt;ref&gt;Mor, N., &amp; Winquist, J. Self-focused attention and negative affect: A meta-analysis. ''Psychological Bulletin, 128''(4), 636-662. doi: 10.1037/0033-2909.128.4.638&lt;/ref&gt;  Results from brain-imaging studies shows
that during self-referential processing, those with major depressive disorder show greater activation in the medial prefrontal cortex, suggesting that depressed individuals may be exhibiting greater cognitive control than
non-depressed individuals when processing self-relevant information.&lt;ref name="source35"&gt;Lemogne, C., le Bastard, G., Mayberg, H., Volle, E., Bergouignan, L., Lehericy, S., et al. (2009). In search of the depressive self: extended medial prefrontal network during self-referential processing in major depression. ''Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 4'', 305-312.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2481">In mathematics, '''semi-infinite''' objects are objects which are [[Infinity|infinite]] or [[unbounded]] in some but not all possible ways.

==In ordered structures and Euclidean spaces==

Generally, a semi-infinite set is [[Bounded set|bounded]] in one direction, and [[unbounded]] in another.  For instance, the [[natural numbers]] are semi-infinite considered as a subset of the integers; similarly, the [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]] &lt;math&gt;(c,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,c)&lt;/math&gt; and their closed counterparts are semi-infinite subsets of &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt;.  [[Half-space (geometry)|Half-space]]s are sometimes described as semi-infinite regions.

Semi-infinite regions occur frequently in the study of [[differential equations]].&lt;ref&gt;Bateman, [http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183492736 Transverse seismic waves on the surface of a semi-infinite solid composed of heterogeneous material], Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. Volume 34, Number 3 (1928), 343–348.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram Demonstrations Project, [http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/HeatDiffusionInASemiInfiniteRegion/ Heat Diffusion in a Semi-Infinite Region] (accessed November 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, one might study solutions of the heat equation in an idealised semi-infinite metal bar.

A semi-infinite [[integral]] is an [[improper integral]] over a semi-infinite interval.  More generally, objects indexed or parametrised by semi-infinite sets may be described as semi-infinite.&lt;ref&gt;Cator, Pimentel, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.4706v3 A shape theorem and semi-infinite geodesics for the Hammersley model with random weights], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most forms of semi-infiniteness are [[Bounded set|bounded]]ness properties, not [[cardinality]] or [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] properties: semi-infinite sets are typically infinite in cardinality and measure.

==In optimization==
{{Main|Semi-infinite programming}}

Many [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problems involve some set of variables and some set of constraints.  A problem is called semi-infinite if one (but not both) of these sets is finite.  The study of such problems is known as [[semi-infinite programming]].&lt;ref&gt;Reemsten, Rückmann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sJgX5jQZnQcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=gvz6-MY_t1&amp;dq=semi-infinite%20programming&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Semi-infinite Programming], Kluwer Academic, 1998.  {{ISBN|0-7923-5054-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2439">A '''singular term''' is a paradigmatic referring device in a language. Singular terms are of philosophical importance for [[philosophy of language|philosophers of language]], because they ''refer'' to things in the world, and the ability of words to refer calls for scrutiny.

==Overview==
Singular terms are defined as expressions that purport to denote or designate particular individual people, places, or other objects. They contrast with ''general terms'' (such as "car" or "chair") which can apply to more than one thing.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Lycan]], ''Philosophy of Language'', 2nd edition, Routledge, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are various kinds of singular terms: proper names (eg. "Matthew"), definite descriptions (eg. "the second fisherman in the boat"), singular personal pronouns (eg. "she"), demonstrative pronouns (eg. "this"), etc.

Historically, various definitions for "singular term" have been offered:

# A term that tells us which individual is being talked about. ([[John Stuart Mill]], [[Arthur Prior]], [[P. F. Strawson]]) &lt;ref&gt;Strawson 1950, Prior 1976, Mill 1908&lt;/ref&gt;
# A term that is grammatically singular, i.e. a [[proper name]] (''proprium nomen''), a [[demonstrative pronoun]] (''pronomen demonstrativum'') or a demonstrative pronoun with a common name (''cum termino communi''). ([[William of Ockham]])&lt;ref&gt;Ockham, ''Summa Logicae''&lt;/ref&gt;
# A term that is inherently ''about'' the object to which it applies or [[Reference|refers]]. ([[Gottlob Frege]]) &lt;ref&gt;Frege 1892&lt;/ref&gt;
# A term that is true "in the same sense" of only one object. ([[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]])&lt;ref&gt;Peter of Spain 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25380">'''Status quo bias''' is an [[emotional bias]]; a preference for the current state of affairs. The current baseline (or status quo) is taken as a reference point, and any change from that baseline is perceived as a loss.
Status quo bias should be distinguished from a rational preference for the [[status quo]] ante, as when the current state of affairs is objectively superior to the available alternatives, or when imperfect information is a significant problem. A large body of evidence, however, shows that status quo bias frequently affects human decision-making.

Status quo bias interacts with other non-rational cognitive processes such as [[loss aversion]], existence bias, [[endowment effect]], longevity, mere exposure, and regret avoidance.  Experimental evidence for the detection of status quo bias is seen through the use of the [[reversal test]]. A vast amount of experimental and field examples exist. Behaviour in regard to retirement plans, health, and ethical choices show evidence of the status quo bias.

==Examples==
[[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman]], [[Richard Thaler|Thaler]], and [[Jack Knetsch|Knetsch]] created experiments that could produce this effect reliably.&lt;ref name=Knetsch&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kahneman | first1 = D. | last2 = Knetsch | first2 = J. L. | last3 = Thaler | first3 = R. H. | year = 1991 | title = Anomalies: The Endowment Effect, Loss Aversion, and Status Quo Bias | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 193–206 | doi=10.1257/jep.5.1.193}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuelson]] and [[Zeckhauser]] (1988) demonstrated status quo bias using a questionnaire in which subjects faced a series of decision problems, which were alternately framed to be with and without a pre-existing status quo position. Subjects tended to remain with the status quo when such a position was offered to them.&lt;ref name=Samuelson&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Samuelson | first1 = W. | last2 = Zeckhauser | first2 = R. | year = 1988 | title = Status quo bias in decision making | url = | journal = Journal of Risk and Uncertainty | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 7–59 | doi=10.1007/bf00055564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hypothetical Choice Tasks:'''
Subjects were given a hypothetical
choice task in the following "neutral" version, in which no status
quo was defined: "You are a serious reader of the financial pages
but until recently you have had few funds to invest. That is when
you inherited a large sum of money from your great-uncle. You are
considering different portfolios. Your choices are to invest in: a
moderate-risk company, a high-risk company, treasury bills, municipal
bonds." Other subjects were presented with the same problem
but with one of the options designated as the status quo. In this
case, the opening passage continued: "A significant portion of this
portfolio is invested in a moderate risk company . . . (The tax and broker commission consequences of any changes are insignificant.)"
The result was that an alternative became much more popular
when it was designated as the status quo.&lt;ref name=Samuelson /&gt;

'''Electric Power Consumers:'''
California electric power consumers were
asked about their preferences regarding trade-offs between service
reliability and rates. The respondents fell into two groups, one with
much more reliable service than the other. Each group was asked
to state a preference among six combinations of reliability and rates,
with one of the combinations designated as the status quo. A strong
bias to the status quo was observed. Of those in the high-reliability
group, 60.2 percent chose the status quo, whereas a mere 5.7 percent
chose the low-reliability option that the other group had been
experiencing, despite its lower rates. Similarly, of those in the low reliability
group, 58.3 chose their low-reliability status quo, and only
5.8 chose the high-reliability option.&lt;ref name=Consumer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartman|first=Raymond S.|author2=Chi-Keung Woo |title=Consumer Rationality and the Status Quo|journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics|year=1991|volume=106|pages=141–162|doi=10.2307/2937910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Automotive Insurance Consumers and Other Examples:'''
The US states of [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]] inadvertently ran a real-life experiment providing evidence of status quo bias in the early 1990s. As part of [[tort law]] reform programs, citizens were offered two options for their automotive insurance: an expensive option giving them full right to [[lawsuit|sue]] and a less expensive option with restricted rights to sue. In New Jersey the cheaper option was the default and most citizens selected it. Only a minority chose the cheaper option in Pennsylvania, where the more expensive option was the default.  Similar effects have been shown for contributions to retirement plans, choice of [[internet privacy]] policies and the decision to become an organ donor.

==Explanations==
Status quo bias has been attributed to a combination of [[loss aversion]] and the [[endowment effect]], two ideas relevant to [[prospect theory]]. An individual weighs the potential losses of switching from the status quo more heavily than the potential gains; this is due to the prospect theory value function being steeper in the loss domain.&lt;ref name=Samuelson/&gt;  As a result, the individual will prefer not to switch at all. In other words, we tend to oppose change unless the benefits outweigh the risks. However, the status quo bias is maintained even in the absence of gain/loss framing: for example, when subjects were asked to choose the colour of their new car, they tended towards one colour arbitrarily framed as the status quo.&lt;ref name=Samuelson/&gt; Loss aversion, therefore, cannot wholly explain the status quo bias,&lt;ref name=Korobkin&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Korobkin | first1 = R.  | year = 1997 | title = The status quo bias and contract default rules | url =http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/research/cornell-law-review/upload/Korobkin-2.pdf | journal = Cornell Law Review | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 608–687 |ssrn=52240}}&lt;/ref&gt; with other potential causes including regret avoidance,&lt;ref name=Korobkin/&gt; [[transaction cost]]s&lt;ref name=Tversky&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tversky | first1 = A. | last2 = Kahneman | first2 = D. | year = 1991 | title = Loss aversion in riskless choice: a reference-dependent model | url = | journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics | volume = 106 | issue = 4| pages = 1039–1061 | doi=10.2307/2937956}}&lt;/ref&gt; and psychological commitment.&lt;ref name=Samuelson/&gt;

===Rational routes to status quo maintenance===

A status quo bias can also be a rational route if there are cognitive or informational limitations.

;Informational limitations
Decision outcomes are rarely certain, nor is the utility they may bring.

Status quo alternatives often require less mental effort to maintain.&lt;ref&gt;Eidelman &amp; Crandall, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irrational routes===
The irrational maintenance of the status quo bias links and confounds many cognitive biases.

;Existence bias
An assumption of longevity and goodness are part of the status quo bias.  People treat [[existence]] as a prima facie case for goodness, aesthetic and longevity increases this preference.&lt;ref name="EidelmanCrandall2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eidelman|first1=Scott|last2=Crandall|first2=Christian S.|title=Bias in Favor of the Status Quo|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|volume=6|issue=3|year=2012|pages=270–281|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2012.00427.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The status quo bias affects people's preferences; people report preferences for what they are likely rather than unlikely to receive. People simply assume, with little reason or deliberation, the goodness of existing
states.&lt;ref name="EidelmanCrandall2012" /&gt;

[[Longevity]] is a corollary of the existence bias: if existence is good, longer existence should be better. This thinking resembles quasi-evolutionary notions of "survival of the fittest", and also the augmentation principle in attribution theory.&lt;ref name="Kelley1971"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelley|first=Harold H.|title=Attribution in Social Interaction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s_0_AAAAMAAJ|year=1971|publisher=General Learning Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inertia]] is another reason used to explain a bias towards the status quo. Another explanation is fear of regret in making a wrong decision, i.e.  If we choose a partner, when we think there could be someone better out there.&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite news|last=Venkatesh|first=B.|title=Benefitting from status quo bias}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Unclear attribution to news article|date=November 2014}}

===Mere exposure===
[[Mere exposure]] is an explanation for the status quo bias.  Existing states are encountered more frequently than non-existent states and because of this they will be perceived as more true and evaluated more preferably.
One way to increase liking for something is repeated exposure over time.&lt;ref name=exposure&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bornstein|first=R.F.|title=Exposure and affect: Overview and meta- analysis of research|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1989|volume=106|pages=265–289|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.106.2.265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Loss aversion
'''[[Loss aversion]]''' also leads to greater regret for action than for inaction;&lt;ref name="KahnemanSlovicTversky1982"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kahneman|first1=Daniel|last2=Slovic|first2=Paul|last3=Tversky|first3=Amos|title=Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0H8gwj4a1MC|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-28414-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; more
regret is experienced when a decision changes the status quo than when it maintains it.&lt;ref name=inman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inman|first=J.J.|author2=Zeelenberg |title=Regret repeat versus switch decisions: The attenuation role of decision justifiability|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|year=2002|volume=29|pages=116–128|doi=10.1086/339925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together these forces provide an advantage for the status quo; people are motivated to do nothing or to maintain current or previous decisions.&lt;ref name=Samuelson /&gt; Change is avoided, and decision makers stick with what has been done in the past.

Changes from the status quo will typically involve both gains and losses, with the change having good overall consequences if the gains outweigh these losses. A tendency to overemphasize the avoidance of losses will thus favour retaining the status quo, resulting in a status quo bias. Even though choosing the status quo may entail forfeiting certain positive consequences, when these are represented as forfeited "gains" they are psychologically given less weight than the "losses" that would be incurred if the status quo were changed.&lt;ref name="BostromOrd2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|last2=Ord|first2=Toby|title=The Reversal Test: Eliminating Status Quo Bias in Applied Ethics|journal=Ethics|volume=116|issue=4|year=2006|pages=656–679|doi=10.1086/505233|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/691705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Omission bias
[[Omission bias]] may account for some of the findings previously ascribed to status quo bias.
Omission bias is diagnosed when a decision maker prefers a harmful outcome that results from an omission to a less harmful outcome that results from an action.&lt;ref&gt;Ilana Ritov and Jonathan Baron, "Status-Quo and Omission Biases," Journal of Risk and Uncertainty 5 [1992]: 49–61)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detection===
'''[[Reversal test|The Reversal Test]]''': When a proposal to change a certain parameter is thought to have bad overall consequences, consider a change to the same parameter in the opposite direction. If this is also thought to have bad overall consequences, then the onus is on those who reach these conclusions to explain why our position cannot be improved through changes to this parameter. If they are unable to do so, then we have reason to suspect that they suffer from status quo bias. The rationale of the Reversal Test is: if a continuous parameter admits of a wide range of possible values, only a tiny subset of which can be local optima, then it is prima facie implausible that the actual value of that parameter should just happen to be at one of these rare local optima.&lt;ref name="BostromOrd2006" /&gt;

===Neural activity===
A study found that erroneous status quo rejections have a greater neural impact than erroneous status quo acceptances.  This asymmetry in the genesis of regret might drive the status quo bias on subsequent decisions.&lt;ref name="NicolleFleming2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicolle|first1=A.|last2=Fleming|first2=S. M.|last3=Bach|first3=D. R.|last4=Driver|first4=J.|last5=Dolan|first5=R. J.|title=A Regret-Induced Status Quo Bias|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=31|issue=9|year=2011|pages=3320–3327|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5615-10.2011|pmid=21368043|pmc=3059787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study was done using a visual detection task in which subjects tended to favour the default when making difficult, but not easy, decisions. This bias was suboptimal in that more errors were made when the default was accepted. A selective increase in [[Subthalamic nucleus|sub-thalamic nucleus]] (STN) activity was found when the status quo was rejected in the face of heightened decision difficulty. Analysis of effective connectivity showed that inferior [[frontal cortex]], a region more active for difficult decisions, exerted an enhanced modulatory influence on the STN during switches away from the status quo.&lt;ref name=Neural /&gt;

Research by [[University College London]] scientists that examines the neural pathways involved in 'status quo bias' in the human brain and found that the more difficult the decision we face, the more likely we are not to act.
The study, published in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' (PNAS), looked at the decision-making of participants taking part in a tennis 'line judgement' game while their brains were scanned using [[functional MRI]] (fMRI).
The 16 study participants were asked to look at a cross between two tramlines on a screen while holding down a 'default' key. They then saw a ball land in the court and had to make a decision as to whether it was in or out. On each trial, the computer signalled which was the current default option – 'in' or 'out'. The participants continued to hold down the key to accept the default and had to release it and change to another key to reject the default.
The results showed a consistent bias towards the default, which led to errors. As the task became more difficult, the bias became even more pronounced. The fMRI scans showed that a region of the brain known as the sub-thalamic nucleus (STN) was more active in the cases when the default was rejected. Also, greater flow of information was seen from a separate region sensitive to difficulty (the [[prefrontal cortex]]) to the STN. This indicates that the STN plays a key role in overcoming status quo bias when the decision is difficult.&lt;ref name=Neural&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fleming, Stephen|author2=C. Thomas |author3=R. Dolan |title=Overcoming Status Quo Bias in the Human Brain|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=February 2010|volume=107|issue=13|pages=6005–6009|doi=10.1073/pnas.0910380107|pmid=20231462|pmc=2851882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavioral economics and the default position===
Against this background, two [[Behavioral economics|behavioral economists]] devised an opt-out plan to help employees of a particular company build their retirement savings. In an opt-out plan, the employees are automatically enrolled unless they explicitly ask to be excluded. They found evidence for status quo bias and other associated effects. They also noted that changing the default alternatives has, in some instances, been shown to have dramatic effects on people’s choices.&lt;ref name="save more"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thaler|first=Richard H.|author2=Shlomo Benartzi |title=Save More Tomorrow: Using Behavioural Economics to Increase Employee Saving|journal=Journal of Political Economy|year=2004|volume=112|pages=164–187|doi=10.1086/380085}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=May 2012}}

===Conflict===
Status-quo educational bias can be both a barrier to political progress and a threat to the state's legitimacy and argue that the values of stability, compliance, and patriotism underpin important reasons for status quo bias that appeal not to the substantive merits of existing institutions but merely to the fact that those institutions are the status quo.&lt;ref name="civic edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacMullen|title=On Status-Quo Bias in Civic Education|journal=Journal of Politics|year= 2011|volume=73|issue=3|pages=872–886|doi=10.1017/s0022381611000521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevant fields==

The Status quo bias is seen in important real life decisions; it has been found to be prominent is data on selections of health care plans and retirement programs.&lt;ref name=Samuelson /&gt;

===Politics===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2018}}
Some{{Who|date=August 2018}} believe that preference for the status quo represents a core component of [[Conservatism|conservative ideology]] in societies where government power is limited and laws restricting actions of individuals exist. Conversely, in [[Socialism|socialist]] and [[liberalism|liberal]] societies, movements to impose restrictions on individuals or governments are met with widespread opposition by those that favor the status quo. Reardless of the type of society, the bias tends to hinder [[progressivism|progressive]] movements in the absence of a [[Reactance (psychology)|reaction]] or backlash against [[The powers that be (phrase)|the powers that be]].

===Ethics===
Status quo bias may be responsible for much of the opposition to human enhancement in general and to genetic cognitive enhancement in particular.&lt;ref name="BostromOrd2006" /&gt; Some ethicists argue, however, that status quo bias may not be irrational in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Nebel | first = Jacob | year = 2015 | title = Status Quo Bias, Rationality, and Conservatism about Value | journal = Ethics | volume = 125 | issue = 2 | pages = 449–476 | doi= 10.1086/678482|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/NEBSQB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationality of status quo bias is also an important question in the ethics of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wasserman | first= David| year= 2015 | title= Disability, Diversity, and Preference for the Status Quo: Bias or Justifiable Preference? | journal = American Journal of Bioethics | volume = 15 | issue = 6 | pages = 11–12. | doi=10.1080/15265161.2015.1028676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Education can (sometimes unintentionally) encourage children’s belief in the substantive merits of a particular existing law or political institution, where the effect does not derive from an improvement in their ability or critical thinking about that law or institution. However, this biasing effect is not automatically illegitimate or counterproductive: a balance between social inculcation and openness needs to be maintained.&lt;ref name="civic edu" /&gt;

In elementary schools, reading aloud sessions that exclude ethnically diverse materials create a bias in favor of the status quo that is harmful to children's education.&lt;ref name=reading&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gonzalez-Jensen|first=Margarita|author2=Sadler, Norma |title=Behind Closed Doors: Status Quo Bias in Read Aloud Selections|journal=Equity &amp; Excellence in Education|date=April 1997|volume=30|issue=1|pages=27–31|doi=10.1080/1066568970300104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
An experiment to determine if status-quo bias—bias toward current medication even when better alternatives are offered—exists in a stated-choice study among asthma patients who take prescription combination maintenance medications.
The results of this study indicate that the status quo bias may exist in stated-choice studies, especially with medications that patients have to take daily such as asthma maintenance medications. Stated-choice practitioners should include a current medication in choice surveys to control for this bias.&lt;ref name="MohamedHauber2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mohamed|first1=AF|last2=Hauber|first2=AB|last3=Johnson|first3=FR|last4=Meddis|first4=D|last5=Wagner|first5=S|title=Status Quo Bias in Stated Choice Studies: Is it Real?|journal=Value in Health|volume=11|issue=6|year=2008|pages=A567–A568|doi=10.1016/S1098-3015(10)66867-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement plans===
An example of the status quo bias affecting retirement plans is a study done that examined the U.S. equity mutual fund.  They found that people maintained the plan they had previously, even if it was no longer the optimal choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kempf|first=Alexandre|author2=Stefan Ruenzi |title=Status Quo Bias and the Number of Alternatives: An Empirical Illustration from the Mutual Fund Industry|journal=Journal of Behavioral Finance|year=2006|volume=7|issue=4|pages=204–213|doi=10.1207/s15427579jpfm0704_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8306">'''Transpartisanship''' represents an emerging school of political thought which accepts the validity of truths across a range of political perspectives and seeks to synthesize them into an inclusive, pragmatic container beyond typical political dualities.  It is distinct from [[bipartisanship]], which aims to negotiate between “right” and “left,” resulting in a dualistic perspective, and [[nonpartisanship]], which tends to avoid political affiliation altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ivn.us/2014/05/28/transpartisanship-new-idea-bring-people-together/|title=Transpartisanship: A New Idea to Bring People Together|date=2014-05-28|website=IVN.us|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

Transpartisanship is a movement to support and advance a common ground - or "new center" - that already exists in U.S. politics, emerging periodically into public view in the form of "unusual coalitions" of [[progressives]] and [[conservatives]] around issues ranging from [[war]] and the [[Military budget of the United States|military budget]] to [[corporate power]] and the [[surveillance state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ivn.us/2016/09/06/the-transpartisan-grassroots-movement-to-overturn-citizens-united/|title=The Transpartisan, Grassroots Movement to Overturn Citizens United is Gaining Serious Momentum|date=2016-09-06|website=IVN.us|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.utne.com/Politics/Americas-Transpartisan-Future-Partisan|title=America’s Transpartisan Future|newspaper=Utne|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Husseini, Sam [http://husseini.posthaven.com/the-perennially-unusual-yet-somehow-ubiquitous-left-right-alliance-towards-acknowledging-an-anti-establishment-center "The Perennially 'Unusual' Yet Somehow Ubiquitous Left-Right Alliance: Towards Acknowledging an Anti-Establishment Center"]. http://husseini.posthaven.com. 2013-07-25. Retrieved 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerzon 2016 p."&gt;{{cite book|title=The Reunited States of America : how we can bridge the partisan divide|last=Gerzon|first=Mark|publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc|year=2016|isbn=978-1-62656-658-3|location=Oakland, CA|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement builds on methods of facilitated dialogue, [[deliberation]] and [[conflict resolution]].

Current examples of transpartisan initiatives include [http://www.transpartisancenter.org Transpartisan Center], [http://TheSolution.org TheSolution.org], [http://www.reunitingamerica.org Reuniting America], [http://www.meetup.com/TranspartisanSeattle/ Transpartisan Alliance], and [http://www.libertycoalition.net Liberty Coalition].

* &lt;blockquote&gt; Transpartisanship is an emerging field that advocates pragmatic and effective solutions to social and political problems, transcending and including preexisting political ideologies. Transpartisanship encompasses the idea that all systems are inextricably interconnected, and that successful outcomes can best be reached through inclusive, genuine, and respectful cooperation. Transpartisan democracy, in part, seeks to reintegrate the public’s voice in identifying, debating, and shaping governmental policies, while continuing to protect the sovereignty of the individual. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
* &lt;blockquote&gt; The term “Transpartisanship” has emerged to provide a meaningful alternative to “Bipartisanship,” and “Nonpartisanship.” Bipartisanship limits the dialogue process to two political viewpoints or entities, striving for compromise solutions. Nonpartisanship, on the other hand, tends to deny the existence of differing viewpoints in exchange for cooperation. Both the bipartisan and nonpartisan approaches can discount the multiplicity of viewpoints that exist, which often results in incomplete and therefore unsuccessful outcomes. In contrast to these, transpartisanship recognizes the existence and validity of many points of view, and advocates a constructive dialogue aimed at arriving at creative, integrated, and therefore, breakthrough solutions that meet the needs of all present. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Transpartisan gatherings have resulted not only in surprisingly civil conversations noted by mainstream media&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/joegarofoli/article/MoveOn-founder-Tea-Party-figure-meet-4204384.php|title=MoveOn founder, Tea Party figure meet|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also in shifts from traditional ideological stances by some participants.&lt;ref&gt;Atlee, Tom. "[http://co-intelligence.org/polarization-Fetzer.html A Personally Transformational Encounter of Left and Right]". http://co-intelligence.org. 2004. Retrieved 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

A close relative of transpartisanship is [[Integral politics]]. A transpartisan approach to policy would necessarily include individual and collective, as well as subjective and objective, perspective. Furthermore, similar to [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)|Integral theory]], transpartisanship places politics in a developmental context, viewing democracy and prosperity not as static attainments, but rather emergent properties along a continuum of developmental stages.

==En Marche!==
In 2016, [[Emmanuel Macron]] created a new French political party, [[En Marche]]. The party sought to transcend traditional political boundaries to be a transpartisan organisation.

In [[systems engineering]], the '''tricotyledon theory of system design (T3SD)''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] theory of system design developed by [[A. Wayne Wymore]].&lt;ref name="wymore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wymore|first=A. Wayne|authorlink=A. Wayne Wymore|title=Model-Based Systems Engineering|publisher=CRC Press, Inc.|year=1993|isbn = 084938012X}}&lt;/ref&gt; T3SD consists of a language for describing [[system]]s and [[requirement]]s, which is based on [[set theory]], a mathematical systems model based on port automata, and a precise definition of the different types of system requirements and relationships between requirements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="66101">In [[logic]] and [[computer science]], '''unification''' is an algorithmic process of [[equation solving|solving equations]] between symbolic [[expression (mathematics)|expressions]].

Depending on which expressions (also called ''terms'') are allowed to occur in an equation set (also called ''unification problem''), and which expressions are considered equal, several frameworks of unification are distinguished. If higher-order variables, that is, variables representing [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, are allowed in an expression, the process is called '''higher-order unification''', otherwise '''first-order unification'''. If a solution is required to make both sides of each equation literally equal, the process is called '''syntactic''' or '''free unification''', otherwise '''semantic''' or '''equational unification''', or '''E-unification''', or '''unification modulo theory'''.

A ''solution'' of a unification problem is denoted as a [[substitution (logic)|substitution]], that is, a mapping assigning a symbolic value to each variable of the problem's expressions. A unification algorithm should compute for a given problem a ''complete'', and ''minimal'' substitution set, that is, a set covering all its solutions, and containing no redundant members. Depending on the framework, a complete and minimal substitution set may have at most one, at most finitely many, or possibly infinitely many members, or may not exist at all.&lt;ref group=note&gt;in this case, still a complete substitution set exists (e.g. the set of all solutions at all); however, each such set contains redundant members.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=François|last1=Fages|first2=Gérard|last2=Huet|title=Complete Sets of Unifiers and Matchers in Equational Theories|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|volume=43|pages=189–200|year=1986|doi=10.1016/0304-3975(86)90175-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some frameworks it is generally impossible to decide whether any solution exists. For first-order syntactical unification, Martelli and Montanari&lt;ref name="Martelli.Montanari.1982"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Alberto|last1=Martelli|first2=Ugo|last2=Montanari|title=An Efficient Unification Algorithm|journal=ACM Trans. Program. Lang. Syst.|volume=4|number=2|pages=258–282|date=Apr 1982|doi=10.1145/357162.357169}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave an algorithm that reports unsolvability or computes a complete and minimal singleton substitution set containing the so-called '''most general unifier'''.

For example, using ''x'',''y'',''z'' as variables, the singleton equation set { ''[[cons]]''(''x'',''cons''(''x'',''[[Lisp (programming language)#Lists|nil]]'')) = ''cons''(2,''y'') } is a syntactic first-order unification problem that has the substitution { ''x'' ↦ 2, ''y'' ↦ ''cons''(2,''nil'') } as its only solution.
The syntactic first-order unification problem { ''y'' = ''cons''(2,''y'') } has no solution over the set of [[term (logic)|finite terms]]; however, it has the single solution { ''y'' ↦ ''cons''(2,''cons''(2,''cons''(2,...))) } over the set of [[Tree (set theory)|infinite trees]].
The semantic first-order unification problem { ''a''⋅''x'' = ''x''⋅''a'' } has each substitution of the form { ''x'' ↦ ''a''⋅...⋅''a'' } as a solution in a [[semigroup]], i.e. if (⋅) is considered [[associative]]; the same problem, viewed in an [[abelian group]], where  (⋅) is considered also [[commutative]], has any substitution at all as a solution.
The singleton set { ''a'' = ''y''(''x'') } is a syntactic second-order unification problem, since ''y'' is a function variable.
One solution is { ''x'' ↦ ''a'', ''y'' ↦ ([[identity function]]) }; another one is { ''y'' ↦ ([[constant function]] mapping each value to ''a''), ''x'' ↦ ''(any value)'' }.

The first formal investigation of unification can be attributed to [[J. Alan Robinson|John Alan Robinson]],&lt;ref name="Robinson.1965"&gt;{{cite journal | author=J.A. Robinson | title=A Machine-Oriented Logic Based on the Resolution Principle | journal=Journal of the ACM | volume=12 | number=1 | pages=23–41 |date=Jan 1965 | doi=10.1145/321250.321253}}; Here: sect.5.8, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=J.A. Robinson | title=Computational logic: The unification computation | journal=Machine Intelligence | volume=6 | pages=63–72 | url=http://aitopics.org/sites/default/files/classic/Machine%20Intelligence%206/MI6-Ch4-Robinson.pdf | year=1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who used first-order syntactical unification as a basic building block of his [[Resolution (logic)|resolution]] procedure for first-order logic, a great step forward in [[automated reasoning]] technology, as it eliminated one source of combinatorial explosion: searching for instantiation of terms. Today, automated reasoning is still the main application area of unification.
Syntactical first-order unification is used in [[logic programming]] and programming language [[type system]] implementation, especially in [[Hindley–Milner]] based [[type inference]] algorithms.
Semantic unification is used in [[SMT solver]]s, [[term rewriting]] algorithms and [[cryptographic protocol]] analysis.
Higher-order unification is used in proof assistants, for example [[Isabelle (theorem prover)|Isabelle]] and [[Twelf]], and restricted forms of higher-order unification ('''higher-order pattern unification''') are used in some programming language implementations, such as [[lambdaProlog]], as higher-order patterns are expressive, yet their associated unification procedure retains theoretical properties closer to first-order unification.

==Common formal definitions==

===Prerequisites===

Formally, a unification approach presupposes
* An infinite set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of '''variables'''. For higher-order unification, it is convenient to choose &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; disjoint from the set of [[Lambda term#Lambda terms|lambda-term bound variables]].
* A set &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of '''terms''' such that &lt;math&gt;V \subseteq T&lt;/math&gt;. For first-order unification and higher-order unification, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is usually the set of [[Term (first-order logic)#Terms|first-order terms]] (terms built from variable and function symbols) and [[Lambda term#Lambda terms|lambda terms]] (terms containing some higher-order variables), respectively.
* A mapping ''vars'': &lt;math&gt;T \rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; [[power set|ℙ]]&lt;math&gt;(V)&lt;/math&gt;, assigning to each term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; the set &lt;math&gt;\text{vars}(t) \subsetneq V&lt;/math&gt; of '''free variables''' occurring in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.
* An '''[[equivalence relation]]''' &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, indicating which terms are considered equal. For higher-order unification, usually &lt;math&gt;t\equiv u&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; are [[Lambda term#Alpha equivalence|alpha equivalent]]. For first-order E-unification, &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; reflects the background knowledge about certain function symbols; for example, if &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; is considered commutative, &lt;math&gt;t\equiv u&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; results from &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; by swapping the arguments of &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; at some (possibly all) occurrences. &lt;ref group=note&gt;E.g. ''a'' ⊕ (''b'' ⊕ ''f''(''x'')) ≡ ''a'' ⊕ (''f''(''x'') ⊕ ''b'') ≡ (''b'' ⊕ ''f''(''x'')) ⊕ ''a'' ≡ (''f''(''x'') ⊕ ''b'') ⊕ ''a''&lt;/ref&gt; If there is no background knowledge at all, then only literally, or syntactically, identical terms are considered equal; in this case, ≡ is called the '''[[free theory]]''' (because it is a [[free object]]), the '''[[empty theory]]''' (because the set of equational [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]], or the background knowledge, is empty), the '''theory of [[uninterpreted function]]s''' (because unification is done on uninterpreted [[term (logic)|terms]]), or the '''theory of [[Algebraic specification|constructors]]''' (because all function symbols just build up data terms, rather than operating on them).

===First-order term===
{{main|Term (logic)}}
Given a set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of variable symbols, a set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of constant symbols and sets &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; of ''n''-ary function symbols, also called operator symbols, for each natural number &lt;math&gt;n \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, the set of (unsorted first-order) terms &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is [[recursive definition|recursively defined]] to be the smallest set with the following properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1=C.C. Chang |author1link= Chen Chung Chang|author2= H. Jerome Keisler| author2link=Howard Jerome Keisler| title=Model Theory| year=1977| volume=73| publisher=North Holland|  series=Studies in Logic and the Foundation of Mathematics}}; here: Sect.1.3&lt;/ref&gt;
* every variable symbol is a term: &lt;math&gt;V \subseteq T&lt;/math&gt;,
* every constant symbol is a term: &lt;math&gt;C \subseteq T&lt;/math&gt;,
* from every ''n'' terms &lt;math&gt;t_1, ... t_n&lt;/math&gt;, and every ''n''-ary function symbol &lt;math&gt;f \in F_n&lt;/math&gt;, a larger term &lt;math&gt;f(t_1, ..., t_n)&lt;/math&gt; can be built.
For example, if &lt;math&gt;x\in V&lt;/math&gt; is a variable symbol, &lt;math&gt;1\in C&lt;/math&gt; is a constant symbol, and &lt;math&gt;\text{add} \in F_2&lt;/math&gt; is a binary function symbol, then &lt;math&gt;x\in T, 1\in T&lt;/math&gt;, and (hence) &lt;math&gt;\text{add}(x, 1) \in T&lt;/math&gt; by the first, second, and third term building rule, respectively. The latter term is usually written as &lt;math&gt;x+1&lt;/math&gt;, using [[infix notation]] and the more common operator symbol + for convenience.
&lt;!---move to main article:
Often mathematicians fix the arity (number of arguments) of a function symbol (see [[Signature]]) while typically in syntactic unification problems
a function symbol may have any (finite) number of arguments, and possibly may have different numbers of arguments in different contexts. 
e.g. f(f(a),f(x,y,z)) is a well formed term for unification problems.
---&gt;

===Higher-order term===
{{main|Lambda calculus}}

===Substitution===
{{main|Substitution (logic)}}
A '''substitution''' is a mapping &lt;math&gt;\sigma: V\rightarrow T&lt;/math&gt; from variables to terms; the notation &lt;math&gt; \{x_1\mapsto t_1, ..., x_k \mapsto t_k\}&lt;/math&gt; refers to a substitution mapping each variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; to the term &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;i=1,...,k&lt;/math&gt;, and every other variable to itself. '''Applying''' that substitution to a term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is written in [[postfix notation]] as &lt;math&gt;t \{x_1 \mapsto t_1, ..., x_k \mapsto t_k\}&lt;/math&gt;; it means to (simultaneously) replace every occurrence of each variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; in the term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt;. The result &lt;math&gt;t\tau&lt;/math&gt; of applying a substitution &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; to a term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is called an '''instance''' of that term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.
As a first-order example, applying the substitution {{math|{{mset| ''x'' ↦ ''h''(''a'',''y''), ''z'' ↦ ''b'' }}}} to the term 
{|
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;f(&lt;/math&gt;
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;\textbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;, a, g(&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\textbf{z}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt; ), y)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| yields &amp;nbsp;
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;f(&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\textbf{h}(\textbf{a}, \textbf{y})&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;, a, g(&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\textbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;), y).&lt;/math&gt;
|}

===Generalization, specialization===

If a term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; has an instance equivalent to a term &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, that is, if &lt;math&gt;t\sigma \equiv u&lt;/math&gt; for some substitution &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is called '''more general''' than &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is called '''more special''' than, or '''subsumed''' by, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. For example, &lt;math&gt;x\oplus a&lt;/math&gt; is more general than &lt;math&gt;a\oplus b&lt;/math&gt; if ⊕ is [[Commutative property|commutative]], since then &lt;math&gt;(x\oplus a) \{x\mapsto b\} = b\oplus a\equiv a\oplus b&lt;/math&gt;.

If ≡ is literal (syntactic) identity of terms, a term may be both more general and more special than another one only if both terms differ just in their variable names, not in their syntactic structure; such terms are called '''variants''', or '''renamings''' of each other.
For example, 
&lt;math&gt;f(x_1, a, g(z_1), y_1)&lt;/math&gt;
is a variant of 
&lt;math&gt;f(x_2, a, g(z_2), y_2)&lt;/math&gt;,
since 

&lt;!---Templates apparently don't accept "}" and "=" in its argument---&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f(x_1, a, g(z_1), y_1) \{x_1 \mapsto x_2, y_1 \mapsto y_2, z_1 \mapsto z_2\} = f(x_2, a, g(z_2), y_2) &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
and 
&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f(x_2, a, g(z_2), y_2) \{x_2 \mapsto x_1, y_2 \mapsto y_1, z_2 \mapsto z_1\} = f(x_1, a, g(z_1), y_1)&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
However, &lt;math&gt;f(x_1, a, g(z_1), y_1)&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' a variant of  &lt;math&gt;f(x_2, a, g(x_2), x_2)&lt;/math&gt;, since no substitution can transform the latter term into the former one.
The latter term is therefore properly more special than the former one.

For arbitrary &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;, a term may be both more general and more special than a structurally different term.
For example, if ⊕ is [[idempotent]], that is, if always &lt;math&gt;x \oplus x \equiv x&lt;/math&gt;, then the term &lt;math&gt;x\oplus y&lt;/math&gt; is more general than &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref group=note&gt;since &lt;math&gt;(x\oplus y) \{x\mapsto z, y \mapsto z\} = z\oplus z \equiv z&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and vice versa,&lt;ref group=note&gt;since {{math|1=''z'' {{mset|''z'' ↦ ''x'' ⊕ ''y''}} = ''x'' ⊕ ''y''}}&lt;/ref&gt; although &lt;math&gt;x\oplus y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; are of different structure.

A substitution &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is '''more special''' than, or '''subsumed''' by, a substitution &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;t\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is more special than &lt;math&gt;t\tau&lt;/math&gt; for each term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  We also say that &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is more general than &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.
For instance &lt;math&gt; \{x \mapsto a, y \mapsto a \}&lt;/math&gt; is more special than &lt;math&gt;\tau = \{x\mapsto y\}&lt;/math&gt;,
but 
&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \{x\mapsto a\}&lt;/math&gt; is not,
as &lt;math&gt;f(x, y)\sigma = f(a, y)&lt;/math&gt; is not more special than
&lt;math&gt;f(x, y) \tau = f(y, y)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;K.R. Apt. "From Logic Programming to Prolog", p. 24.  Prentice Hall, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unification problem, solution set===

A '''unification problem''' is a finite set {{math|{{mset| ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≐ ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≐ ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; }}}} of potential equations, where {{math|''l''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''T''}}.
A substitution σ is a '''solution''' of that problem if {{math|''l''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;σ ≡ ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;σ}} for &lt;math&gt;i = 1, ..., n&lt;/math&gt;. Such a substitution is also called a '''unifier''' of the unification problem.
For example, if ⊕ is [[Associative property|associative]], the unification problem { ''x'' ⊕ ''a'' ≐ ''a'' ⊕ ''x'' } has the solutions {''x'' ↦ ''a''}, {''x'' ↦ ''a'' ⊕ ''a''}, {''x'' ↦ ''a'' ⊕ ''a'' ⊕ ''a''}, etc., while the problem { ''x'' ⊕ ''a'' ≐ ''a'' } has no solution.

For a given unification problem, a set ''S'' of unifiers is called '''complete''' if each solution substitution is subsumed by some substitution σ ∈ ''S''; the set ''S'' is called '''minimal''' if none of its members subsumes another one.

==Syntactic unification of first-order terms==

[[File:Triangle diagram of syntactic unification svg.svg|thumb|Schematic triangle diagram of syntactically unifying terms ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by a substitution σ]]
''Syntactic unification of first-order terms'' is the most widely used unification framework.
It is based on ''T'' being the set of ''first-order terms'' (over some given set ''V'' of variables, ''C'' of constants and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''n''-ary function symbols) and on ≡ being ''syntactic equality''.
In this framework, each solvable unification problem {{math|{{mset|''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≐ ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≐ ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} has a complete, and obviously minimal, [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] solution set {{math|1={{mset|''σ''}}}}.
Its member {{mvar|σ}} is called the '''most general unifier''' ('''mgu''') of the problem.
The terms on the left and the right hand side of each potential equation become syntactically equal when the mgu is applied i.e. {{math|1=''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''σ'' = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''σ'' ∧ ... ∧ ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''σ'' = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''σ''}}.
Any unifier of the problem is subsumed&lt;ref group=note&gt;formally: each unifier τ satisfies {{math|1=∀''x'': ''xτ'' = (''xσ'')''ρ''}} for some substitution ρ&lt;/ref&gt; by the mgu {{mvar|σ}}.
The mgu is unique up to variants: if ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are both complete and minimal solution sets of the same syntactical unification problem, then ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = { ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; } and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = { ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; } for some substitutions {{math|1=''σ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|1=''σ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,}} and {{math|1=''xσ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a variant of {{math|1=''xσ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} for each variable ''x'' occurring in the problem.

For example, the unification problem { ''x'' ≐ ''z'', ''y'' ≐ ''f''(''x'') } has a unifier { ''x'' ↦ ''z'', ''y'' ↦ ''f''(''z'') }, because
:{|
|-
| align="right" | ''x''
| { ''x'' ↦ ''z'', ''y'' ↦ ''f''(''z'') }
| =
| align="center" | ''z''
| =
| align="right" | ''z''
| { ''x'' ↦ ''z'', ''y'' ↦ ''f''(''z'') }
|, and
|-
| align="right" | ''y''
| { ''x'' ↦ ''z'', ''y'' ↦ ''f''(''z'') }
| =
| align="center" | ''f''(''z'')
| =
| align="right" | ''f''(''x'')
| { ''x'' ↦ ''z'', ''y'' ↦ ''f''(''z'') }
| .
|}

This is also the most general unifier.
Other unifiers for the same problem are e.g. { ''x'' ↦ ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), ''y'' ↦ ''f''(''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)), ''z'' ↦ ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) }, { ''x'' ↦ ''f''(''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)), ''y'' ↦ ''f''(''f''(''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;))), ''z'' ↦ ''f''(''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)) }, and so on; there are infinitely many similar unifiers.

As another example, the problem ''g''(''x'',''x'') ≐ ''f''(''y'') has no solution with respect to ≡ being literal identity, since any substitution applied to the left and right hand side will keep the outermost ''g'' and ''f'', respectively, and terms with different outermost function symbols are syntactically different.

Given a finite set &lt;math&gt;G = \{ s_1 \doteq t_1, ..., s_n \doteq t_n \}&lt;/math&gt; of potential equations,
the algorithm applies rules to transform it to an equivalent set of equations of the form
{ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≐ ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; ≐ ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; }
where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; are distinct variables and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; are terms containing none of the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.
A set of this form can be read as a substitution.
If there is no solution the algorithm terminates with ⊥; other authors use "Ω", "{}", or "''fail''" in that case.
The operation of substituting all occurrences of variable ''x'' in problem ''G'' with term ''t'' is denoted ''G'' {''x'' ↦ ''t''}.
For simplicity, constant symbols are regarded as function symbols having zero arguments.

====Occurs check====
{{main|Occurs check}}
An attempt to unify a variable ''x'' with a term containing ''x'' as a strict subterm ''x'' ≐ ''f''(..., ''x'', ...) would lead to an infinite term as solution for ''x'', since ''x'' would occur as a subterm of itself.
In the set of (finite) first-order terms as defined above, the equation ''x'' ≐ ''f''(..., ''x'', ...) has no solution; hence the ''eliminate'' rule may only be applied if ''x'' ∉ ''vars''(''t'').
Since that additional check, called ''occurs check'', slows down the algorithm, it is omitted e.g. in most Prolog systems.
From a theoretical point of view, omitting the check amounts to solving equations over infinite trees, see [[#Unification of infinite terms|below]].

====Proof of termination====
For the proof of termination of the algorithm consider a triple &lt;math&gt;\langle n_{var}, n_{lhs}, n_{eqn}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''var''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the number of variables that occur more than once in the equation set, {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''lhs''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the number of function symbols and constants
on the left hand sides of potential equations, and {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''eqn''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the number of equations.
When rule ''eliminate'' is applied, {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''var''&lt;/sub&gt;}} decreases, since ''x'' is eliminated from ''G'' and kept only in { ''x'' ≐ ''t'' }.
Applying any other rule can never increase {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''var''&lt;/sub&gt;}} again.
When rule ''decompose'', ''conflict'', or ''swap'' is applied, {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''lhs''&lt;/sub&gt;}} decreases, since at least the left hand side's outermost ''f'' disappears.
Applying any of the remaining rules ''delete'' or ''check'' can't increase {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''lhs''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, but decreases {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''eqn''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
Hence, any rule application decreases the triple &lt;math&gt;\langle n_{var}, n_{lhs}, n_{eqn}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the [[lexicographical order]], which is possible only a finite number of times.

===Examples of syntactic unification of first-order terms===
In the Prolog syntactical convention a symbol starting with an upper case letter is a variable name; a symbol that starts with a lowercase letter is a function symbol; the comma is used as the logical ''and'' operator.
For mathematical notation, ''x,y,z'' are used as variables, ''f,g'' as function symbols, and ''a,b'' as constants.

===Application: unification in logic programming===

The concept of unification is one of the main ideas behind [[logic programming]], best known through the language [[Prolog]]. It represents the mechanism of binding the contents of variables and can be viewed as a kind of one-time assignment. In Prolog, this operation is denoted by the equality symbol &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, but is also done when instantiating variables (see below). It is also used in other languages by the use of the equality symbol &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, but also in conjunction with many operations including &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;. [[Type inference]] algorithms are typically based on unification.

In Prolog:
# A [[variable (programming)|variable]] which is uninstantiated—i.e. no previous unifications were performed on it—can be unified with an atom, a term, or another uninstantiated variable, thus effectively becoming its alias. In many modern Prolog dialects and in [[first-order logic]], a variable cannot be unified with a term that contains it; this is the so-called ''[[occurs check]]''.
# Two atoms can only be unified if they are identical.
# Similarly, a term can be unified with another term if the top function symbols and [[Arity|arities]] of the terms are identical and if the parameters can be unified simultaneously. Note that this is a recursive behavior.

=== Application: type inference ===

Unification is used during type inference, for instance in the functional programming language [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]. On one hand, the programmer does not need to provide type information for every function, on the other hand it is used to detect typing errors. The Haskell expression &lt;code&gt;True : ['a', 'b', 'c']&lt;/code&gt; is not correctly typed. The list construction function &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt; is of type &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]&lt;/code&gt;, and for the first argument &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; the polymorphic type variable &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; has to be unified with &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;'s type, &lt;code&gt;Bool&lt;/code&gt;. The second argument, &lt;code&gt;['a', 'b', 'c']&lt;/code&gt;, is of type &lt;code&gt;[Char]&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; cannot be both &lt;code&gt;Bool&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Char&lt;/code&gt; at the same time.

Like for Prolog, an algorithm for type inference can be given:

# Any type variable unifies with any type expression, and is instantiated to that expression.  A specific theory might restrict this rule with an occurs check.
# Two type constants unify only if they are the same type.
# Two type constructions unify only if they are applications of the same type constructor and all of their component types recursively unify.

Due to its declarative nature, the order in a sequence of unifications is (usually) unimportant.

Note that in the terminology of [[first-order logic]], an atom is a basic proposition and is unified similarly to a Prolog term.

==Order-sorted unification==
''[[Many-sorted logic#Order-sorted logic|Order-sorted logic]]'' allows one to assign a ''sort'', or ''type'', to each term, and to declare a sort ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; a ''subsort'' of another sort ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, commonly written as ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, when reаsoning about biological creatures, it is useful to declare a sort ''dog'' to be a subsort of a sort ''animal''. Wherever a term of some sort ''s'' is required, a term of any subsort of ''s'' may be supplied instead.
For example, assuming a function declaration ''mother'': ''animal'' → ''animal'', and a constant declaration ''lassie'': ''dog'', the term  ''mother''(''lassie'') is perfectly valid and has the sort ''animal''. In order to supply the information that the mother of a dog is a dog in turn, another declaration ''mother'': ''dog'' → ''dog'' may be issued; this is called ''function overloading'', similar to [[Overloading (programming)|overloading in programming languages]].

[[Christoph Walther|Walther]] gave a unification algorithm for terms in order-sorted logic, requiring for any two declared sorts ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; their intersection ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be declared, too: if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a variable of sort ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, the equation ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≐ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has the solution { ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x'' }, where ''x'': ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Christoph|last1=Walther|authorlink=Christoph Walther|title=A Mechanical Solution of Schubert's Steamroller by Many-Sorted Resolution|journal=Artif.

After incorporating this algorithm into a clause-based automated theorem prover, he could solve a benchmark problem by translating it into order-sorted logic, thereby boiling it down an order of magnitude, as many unary predicates turned into sorts.

In his framework, subsort declarations are propagated to complex type expressions.
As a programming example, a parametric sort ''list''(''X'') may be declared (with ''X'' being a type parameter as in a [[Template (C++)#Function templates|C++ template]]), and from a subsort declaration ''int'' ⊆ ''float'' the relation ''list''(''int'') ⊆ ''list''(''float'') is automatically inferred, meaning that each list of integers is also a list of floats.

As an example, assuming subsort declarations ''even'' ⊆ ''int'' and ''odd'' ⊆ ''int'', a term declaration like ∀ ''i'' : ''int''. (''i'' + ''i'') : ''even'' allows to declare a property of integer addition that could not be expressed by ordinary overloading.

==E-unification==

'''E-unification''' is the problem of finding solutions to a given set of [[equations]],
taking into account some equational background knowledge ''E''.
The latter is given as a set of universal [[Equality (mathematics)|equalities]].
For some particular sets ''E'', equation solving [[algorithms]] (a.k.a. ''E-unification algorithms'') have been devised;
for others it has been proven that no such algorithms can exist.

For example, if {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are distinct constants,
the [[equation]] {{tmath|x * a \doteq y * b}} has no solution
with respect to purely [[Unification (computer science)#Syntactic unification problem on first-order terms|syntactic unification]],
where nothing is known about the operator {{tmath|*}}.
However, if the {{tmath|*}} is known to be [[Commutativity|commutative]],
then the substitution {{math|{{mset|''x'' ↦ ''b'', ''y'' ↦ ''a''}}}} solves the above equation,
since
:{|
|
| {{tmath|x * a}}

|-
| {{=}}
| {{tmath|y * b}}
| {{math|{{mset|''x'' ↦ ''b'', ''y'' ↦ ''a''}}}}
| by (converse) substitution application
|}
The background knowledge ''E'' could state the commutativity of {{tmath|*}} by the universal equality
"{{tmath|1=u * v = v * u}} for all {{math|''u'', ''v''}}".

It is said that ''unification is decidable'' for a theory, if a unification algorithm has been devised for it that terminates for ''any'' input problem.
It is said that ''unification is [[Decidable problem#Decidability|semi-decidable]]'' for a theory, if a unification algorithm has been devised for it that terminates for any ''solvable'' input problem, but may keep searching forever for solutions of an unsolvable input problem.

Starting with ''G'' being the unification problem to be solved and ''S'' being the identity substitution, rules are applied nondeterministically until the empty set appears as the actual ''G'', in which case the actual ''S'' is a unifying substitution. Depending on the order the paramodulation rules are applied, on the choice of the actual equation from ''G'', and on the choice of ''R''’s rules in ''mutate'', different computations paths are possible. Only some lead to a solution, while others end at a ''G'' ≠ {} where no further rule is applicable (e.g. ''G'' = { ''f''(...) ≐ ''g''(...) }).

|-
|'''2''' &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
| ''app''(''x''.''y'',''z'')
| → ''x''.''app''(''y'',''z'')
|}

For an example, a term rewrite system ''R'' is used defining the ''append'' operator of lists built from ''cons'' and ''nil''; where ''cons''(''x'',''y'') is written in infix notation as ''x''.''y'' for brevity; e.g. ''app''(''a''.''b''.''nil'',''c''.''d''.''nil'') → ''a''.''app''(''b''.''nil'',''c''.''d''.''nil'') → ''a''.''b''.''app''(''nil'',''c''.''d''.''nil'') → ''a''.''b''.''c''.''d''.''nil'' demonstrates the concatenation of the lists ''a''.''b''.''nil'' and ''c''.''d''.''nil'', employing the rewrite rule 2,2, and 1. The equational theory ''E'' corresponding to ''R'' is the [[Closure (mathematics)#P closures of binary relations|congruence closure]] of ''R'', both viewed as binary relations on terms.
For example, ''app''(''a''.''b''.''nil'',''c''.''d''.''nil'') ≡ ''a''.''b''.''c''.''d''.''nil'' ≡ ''app''(''a''.''b''.''c''.''d''.''nil'',''nil''). The paramodulation algorithm enumerates solutions to equations with respect to that ''E'' when fed with the example ''R''.

A successful example computation path for the unification problem { ''app''(''x'',''app''(''y'',''x'')) ≐ ''a''.''a''.''nil'' } is shown below. To avoid variable name clashes, rewrite rules are consistently renamed each time before their use by rule ''mutate''; ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... are computer-generated variable names for this purpose. In each line, the chosen equation from ''G'' is highlighted in red. Each time the ''mutate'' rule is applied, the chosen rewrite rule (''1'' or ''2'') is indicated in parentheses. From the last line, the unifying substitution ''S'' = { ''y'' ↦ ''nil'', ''x'' ↦  ''a''.''nil'' } can be obtained. In fact,
''app''(''x'',''app''(''y'',''x'')) {''y''↦''nil'', ''x''↦ ''a''.''nil'' } = ''app''(''a''.''nil'',''app''(''nil'',''a''.''nil'')) ≡ ''app''(''a''.''nil'',''a''.''nil'') ≡ ''a''.''app''(''nil'',''a''.''nil'') ≡ ''a''.''a''.''nil'' solves the given problem.
A second successful computation path, obtainable by choosing "mutate(1), mutate(2), mutate(2), mutate(1)" leads to the substitution ''S'' = { ''y'' ↦ ''a''.''a''.''nil'', ''x'' ↦ ''nil'' }; it is not shown here. No other path leads to a success.

If ''R'' is a [[Term rewriting#Termination and convergence|convergent term rewriting system]] for ''E'',
an approach alternative to the previous section consists in successive application of "'''narrowing steps'''";
this will eventually enumerate all solutions of a given equation.
A narrowing step (cf. picture) consists in
* choosing a nonvariable subterm of the current term,

Formally, if {{math|''l'' → ''r''}} is a [[Term (logic)#Structural equality|renamed copy]] of a rewrite rule from ''R'', having no variables in common with a term ''s'', and the [[Term (logic)#Operations with terms|subterm]] {{math|''s''{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is not a variable and is unifiable with {{mvar|l}} via the [[#Syntactic unification of first-order terms|mgu]] {{mvar|σ}}, then {{mvar|s}} can be '''narrowed''' to the term {{math|1=''t'' = ''sσ''[''rσ'']&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, i.e. to the term {{mvar|sσ}}, with the subterm at ''p'' [[Term (logic)#Operations with terms|replaced]] by {{mvar|rσ}}. The situation that ''s'' can be narrowed to ''t'' is commonly denoted as ''s'' ~› ''t''.
Intuitively, a sequence of narrowing steps ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ~› ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ~› ... ~› ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; can be thought of as a sequence of rewrite steps ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ... → ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, but with the initial term ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; being further and further instantiated, as necessary to make each of the used rules applicable.

The [[#One-sided paramodulation|above]] example paramodulation computation corresponds to the following narrowing sequence ("↓" indicating instantiation here):

{|
|-
| ''app''( || ''x'' || ,''app''(''y'', || ''x'' || ))
|-
|     ||  ↓  ||  ||  ↓  ||   ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ''x'' ↦ ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| ''app''( || ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || ,''app''(''y'', || ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || ))  ||  →  ||  ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''app''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,''app''( || ''y'' || ,''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;))
|-
|     ||         ||         ||         ||     ||                   ||                   ||  ↓  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||    ||  ||  ''y'' ↦ ''nil''
|-
|     ||         ||         ||         ||     ||                   ||  ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''app''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,''app''( || ''nil'' || ,''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;))  ||  →  ||  ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''app''( || ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || ,''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. || ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || )
|-
|     ||         ||         ||         ||     ||                   ||                   ||     ||             ||                   ||           ||  ↓  ||   ||  ↓  ||  ||  ||  ||  ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''nil''
|-
|     ||         ||         ||         ||     ||                   ||                   ||     ||             ||                   ||  ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''app''( || ''nil'' || ,''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. || ''nil'' || )  ||  →  ||  ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''nil''
|}

The last term, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''nil'' can be syntactically unified with the original right hand side term ''a''.''a''.''nil''.

The ''narrowing lemma''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Fay| chapter=First-Order Unification in an Equational Theory| title=Proc. 4th Workshop on Automated Deduction| year=1979| pages=161–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; ensures that whenever an instance of a term ''s'' can be rewritten to a term ''t'' by a convergent term rewriting system, then ''s'' and ''t'' can be narrowed and rewritten to a term {{math|1=''s''’}} and {{math|1=''t''’}}, respectively, such that {{math|1=''t''’}} is an instance of {{math|1=''s''’}}.

Formally: whenever {{math|1=''sσ'' {{underset|&amp;lowast;|&amp;rarr;}} ''t''}} holds for some substitution σ, then there exist terms {{math|''s''’, ''t''’}} such that {{math|''s'' {{underset|&amp;lowast;|~›}} ''s''’}} and {{math|''t'' {{underset|&amp;lowast;|&amp;rarr;}} ''t''’}} and {{math|1=''s''’''τ'' = ''t''’}} for some substitution τ.

==Higher-order unification==

Many applications require one to consider the unification of typed lambda-terms instead of first-order terms.  Such unification is often called ''higher-order unification''.  A well studied branch of higher-order unification is the problem of unifying simply typed lambda terms modulo the equality determined by αβη conversions.  Such unification problems do not have most general unifiers.  While higher-order unification is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Warren D. Goldfarb| authorlink=Warren D. Goldfarb| title=The Undecidability of the Second-Order Unification Problem| journal=TCS| year=1981| volume=13| pages=225–230| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304397581900402/pdf?md5=ebe7687d034498bb76c4ea9c5df56f84&amp;pid=1-s2.0-0304397581900402-main.pdf| doi=10.1016/0304-3975(81)90040-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Gérard P.

Huet&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=695200 Gérard Huet: Higher Order Unification 30 Years Later]&lt;/ref&gt; and Gilles Dowek&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Dowek: Higher-Order Unification and Matching. Handbook of Automated Reasoning 2001: 1009–1062&lt;/ref&gt; have written articles surveying this topic.

[[Dale Miller (computer scientist)|Dale Miller]] has described what is now called ''higher-order pattern unification''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Dale|last1=Miller|title=A Logic Programming Language with Lambda-Abstraction, Function Variables, and Simple Unification|journal=Journal of Logic and Computation|year=1991|pages=497–536|url=http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Dale.Miller/papers/jlc91.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subset of higher-order unification is decidable and solvable unification problems have most-general unifiers.  Many computer systems that contain higher-order unification, such as the higher-order logic programming languages [[λProlog]] and [[Twelf]], often implement only the pattern fragment and not full higher-order unification.

In computational linguistics, one of the most influential theories of [[Elliptical construction|ellipsis]] is that ellipses are represented by free variables whose values are then determined using Higher-Order Unification (HOU). For instance, the semantic representation of "Jon likes Mary and Peter does too" is  {{math| like(''j'', ''m'') &amp;and; R(''p'') }} and the value of R (the semantic representation of the ellipsis) is determined by the equation {{math| like(''j'', ''m'') {{=}} R(''j'')  }}. The process of solving such equations is called Higher-Order Unification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Claire | last1 = Gardent | first2 = Michael | last2 = Kohlhase | first3 = Karsten | last3 = Konrad | author2link=Michael Kohlhase| chapter=A Multi-Level, Higher-Order Unification Approach to Ellipsis| title=Submitted to European [[Association for Computational Linguistics]] (EACL)&lt;!---according to http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/cbenzmueller/papers/R8.pdf---&gt;| year=1997| volume=| pages=| publisher=| editor=| series=|citeseerx = 10.1.1.55.9018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the unification problem { ''f''(''a'',  ''b'', ''a'') ≐ ''d''(''b'', ''a'', ''c'') }, where the only variable is ''f'', has the
solutions {''f'' ↦ λ''x''.λ''y''.λ''z''.''d''(''y'', ''x'', ''c'')  }, {''f'' ↦ λ''x''.λ''y''.λ''z''.''d''(''y'', ''z'', ''c'')  },
{''f'' ↦ λ''x''.λ''y''.λ''z''.''d''(''y'', ''a'', ''c'')  }, {''f'' ↦ λ''x''.λ''y''.λ''z''.''d''(''b'', ''x'', ''c'')  },
{''f'' ↦ λ''x''.λ''y''.λ''z''.''d''(''b'', ''z'', ''c'')  } and {''f'' ↦ λ''x''.λ''y''.λ''z''.''d''(''b'', ''a'', ''c'')  }.

[[Wayne Snyder]] gave a generalization of both higher-order unification and E-unification, i.e. an algorithm to unify lambda-terms modulo an equational theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Wayne Snyder | contribution=Higher order E-unification | title=Proc. 10th [[Conference on Automated Deduction]] | publisher=Springer | series=LNAI | volume=449 | pages=573–587 |date=Jul 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6357">'''Women's police stations''' (also '''units''' or '''offices''') – {{lang-es|Comisaría de la Mujer}}, {{lang-pt|Delegacia da mulher}} – are [[police station]]s specializing in crimes with female victims. They were first introduced in 1985 in Brazil and are numerous in Latin America.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/1093-womens-police-stations-units.html |title=Women's police stations / units |publisher=[[UN Women]] |accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Latin American Perspectives'', the first women's police station was opened in [[Sao Paulo]], [[Brazil]]{{Clarify|reason=São Paulo?|date=April 2016}} and "In the first six months of operation, the DDM processed 2,083 reports."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Sara|date=1996|title=Constructing and Negotiating Gender in Women's Police Stations in Brazil|jstor=2633942|journal=Latin American Perspectives|doi=|pmid=|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Police officer|Officers]] at these stations are only allowed to respond to certain crimes, such as [[psychological violence]], [[domestic violence]], [[family violence]], as well as specific types of threats and [[sexual violence]].  Some units offer financial help, counseling, and medical care for women who are having trouble.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;

In India, a study found "the establishment of 188 women's police stations resulted in a 23 percent increase in reporting of crimes against women and children and a higher conviction rate between 2002 and 2004".&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt;

== Aim ==
Women's police stations are located in mostly Latin American countries where rates of rape and violence against women are high.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/299-fast-facts-statistics-on-violence-against-women-and-girls-.html&lt;/ref&gt; Americasquarterly.org states, "Femicide—the killing of women—has reached alarming levels in Latin America.  The most recent region-wide statistics available, from 2003, show that seven Latin American countries score among the worst 10 nations when measuring the rate of femicide per one million women in 40 countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americasquarterly.org/node/1930|title=Gender: Violence Against Women|last=Gasman|first=Nadine|date=|website=Americas Quarterly|publisher=|access-date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's police stations are also in Ghana, [[Women in India|India]], Pakistan, Kosovo, Liberia, Nicaragua, Peru, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Uganda and Uruguay. A policewoman at a station in Pakistan states, "Even if a woman is being beaten and psychologically tortured, she's told to consider her husband's honor and not go to the police station."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/world/2015/08/22/3694083/pakistan-policewomen/|title=Why This Police Force's Gender Problem Is Bad News For Women|last=Ahmed|first=Beenish|date=22 August 2015|website=thinkprocess.org|publisher=|access-date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women in Latin America do not even know their rights, Endvawow.org states, "Only in Brazil had a majority of women surveyed receiving training or information about their rights one or more times (by any source): 54% in Brazil, 42% in Nicaragua, 34% in Peru, and 23% in Ecuador."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endvawnow.org/uploads/browser/files/security_wps_case_study.pdf|title=Women's Police Stations in Latin America Case Study: An Entry Point for Stopping Violence and Gaining Access to Justice (Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Nicaragua)|last=|first=|date=December 2011|website=Endvawnow.org|publisher=|access-date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hautzinger in her article ''Criminalising Male Violence in Brazil's Women's Police Stations'', in Salvador, Brazil in regular police stations in spousal violence cases less than 2% actually went to court and the punishments the men did get were very minor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hautzinger|first=Sarah|date=2002|title=Criminalising Male Violence in Brazil's Women's Police Stations: from awed essentialism to imagined communities|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=88a50b7a-736a-4bc0-ad8f-f74fa15c4911%40sessionmgr4004&amp;vid=5&amp;hid=4101|journal=Journal of Gender Studies|doi=|pmid=|access-date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Endvawnow states that women police stations are an important first step for crimes to enter the justice system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Results ==
Women's police stations have greatly expanded since 1985. Endvawnow.org states, "In 2010, there were 475 WPS in Brazil, 34 in Ecuador, 59 in Nicaragua, and 27 in Peru."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Santos' article ''EN-GENDERING THE POLICE'' states, "They [women's police stations] expanded victims' citizenship rights, allowing them to denounce a violence that not long ago was invisible and considered a private matter. In 2000, for example, 310,058 complaints of violence against women were registered in the women's police stations of Sao Paulo."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Santos|first=Cecilia|date=21 January 2004|title=EN-GENDERING THE POLICE: &gt; Women's Police Stations and Feminism in Sao Paulo*|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=614ba16b-06b5-45e9-aad9-0eac03dc2a09%40sessionmgr198&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=123|journal=Latin American Research Review|doi=|pmid=|access-date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language barriers and the inability to get to a station is still a problem. According to Endvawnow.org, women's police stations are located in more populated areas making it hard for women in [[rural area]]s to get to them and women who do not speak the same language as the policewomen can not communicate effectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Endvawnow.org also states "It was also found that poor and less educated women are sometimes ignored in the WPS. Also, despite psychological violence being illegal in all four countries, operators frequently prioritise those cases in which women have severe visible physical injuries, and may resist accepting complaints of psychological violence."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Over the last decade of his coaching tenure at Ohio State, Hayes's Buckeye squads faced off in a fierce rivalry against the [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan Wolverines]] coached by [[Bo Schembechler]], a former player under and assistant coach to Hayes. During that stretch in the [[Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry]], dubbed "[[The Ten Year War]]", Hayes and Schembechler's teams won or shared the Big Ten Conference crown every season and usually each placed in the national rankings.

Despite his great achievements at Ohio State, Hayes's coaching career ended ignominiously when he was dismissed from his position as head coach after punching Clemson nose guard Charlie Bauman for intercepting an Ohio State pass with two minutes left on the clock in the [[1978 Gator Bowl]].  He was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] as a coach in 1983.

==Early years==
A native of [[Clifton, Ohio]], Hayes was the youngest of three children born to Wayne B. and Effie (née Hupp) Hayes.  He played [[Center (American football)|center]] at [[Newcomerstown High School]] in [[Newcomerstown, Ohio]]. At [[Denison University]], he played [[offensive tackle|tackle]] under coach Tom Rogers, and was a member of [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity. After graduating from Denison in 1935, Hayes went on to serve as an assistant at two [[Ohio]] high schools: [[Mingo Junction]] in 1935–1936 and [[New Philadelphia, Ohio|New Philadelphia]] in 1937. When New Philadelphia head coach John Brickels left to accept another position, Hayes was elevated to the head coaching position, where he put together a 17–2–1 record in his first two seasons before enduring a 1–9 record in 1940.

Hayes enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] in July 1941, eventually rising to the rank of [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] during [[World War II]]. He commanded ''PC 1251'' in the [[Palau Islands]] invasion and the destroyer-escort [[USS Rinehart|USS ''Rinehart'']] in both the Atlantic and Pacific operations.

As World War II was near its end, and Hayes' alma mater, Denison University, was pursuing plans to reinstate its football program (which had been suspended during the war), it contacted former head coach Rogers (also in the Navy) about rejoining the program as head coach. Rogers declined, but recommended that his former team captain, Hayes, should be named the next head coach. Denison was able to locate and give Hayes an offer, which he accepted, minutes before his Navy ship was to begin the voyage through the [[Panama Canal]] &amp;mdash; meaning Hayes would have been [[Solitary confinement|incommunicado]] for an extended period of time.

==Coaching at Denison and Miami University==
Upon returning to Denison in 1946, Hayes had a hard first year, winning only 2 games, over Capital and the season finale against Wittenberg. However, that victory sparked a 19-game winning streak, a surge that propelled him into the head coaching position at Miami University. Miami is recognized as the "[[Cradle of Coaches]]" because of its history of outstanding coaches starting their careers there, such as [[Paul Brown]], [[Ara Parseghian]], [[Weeb Ewbank]], [[Bill Mallory]], [[Sid Gillman]], [[Randy Walker (American football coach)|Randy Walker]], and [[Bo Schembechler]]. Gillman was Hayes' immediate predecessor at Miami before Gillman moved down the road to coach at the [[University of Cincinnati]], which was then Miami's chief rival. Hayes and Gillman maintained a sparkling feud between themselves, combining mutual distaste for the other's coaching style, and because they were in recruiting competition in the same general area.&lt;ref&gt;

In his second year with the [[Miami Redhawks football|Miami Redskins]], Hayes led the 1950 team to an appearance in the [[Salad Bowl (American College Football)|Salad Bowl]], where they defeated [[Arizona State University|Arizona State]]. That success led him to accept the Ohio State head coaching position on February 18, 1951, in a controversial decision after the university rejected the applications of other more well-known coaches, including former Buckeyes' head coach [[Paul Brown]], incumbent Buckeye assistant Harry Strobel, and Missouri head coach [[Don Faurot]].&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, ''op.cit''. pp.84-85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ohio State==
[[File:Woody Hayes, Dick Doyle and Ernie Godfrey (1952).jpg|left|165px|thumb|Hayes with fullback Dick Doyle and assistant coach Ernie Godfrey, 1952]]
As head coach of the [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State Buckeyes]], Hayes led his teams to a 205–61–10 record (.761), including three consensus national championships (1954,1957 and 1968), two other non-consensus national titles (1961 and 1970), 13 [[Big Ten Conference football champions|Big Ten conference championships]], and eight [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] appearances. Hayes was a three-time winner of The College Football Coach of the Year Award, now known as the [[Paul "Bear" Bryant Award]], and was "the subject of more varied and colorful anecdotal material than any other coach past or present, including fabled [[Knute Rockne]]", according to biographer Jerry Brondfield.

Hayes' basic coaching philosophy was that "nobody could win football games unless they regarded the game positively and would agree to pay the price that success demands of a team." His conservative style of football (especially on offense) was often described as "three yards and a cloud of dust"—in other words, a "crunching, frontal assault of muscle against muscle, bone upon bone, will against will." The basic, bread-and-butter play in Hayes' playbook was a fullback off-guard run or a tailback off tackle play. Hayes was often quoted as saying "only three things can happen when you pass (a completion, an incompletion, and an interception) and two of them are bad."

In spite of this apparent willingness to avoid change, Hayes became one of the first major college head coaches to recruit [[African-American]] players, including [[Jim Parker (American football)|Jim Parker]], who played both offensive and defensive tackle on Hayes' first national championship team in 1954. While Hayes was not the first to recruit African-Americans to Ohio State, he was the first to recruit and start African-Americans in large numbers there and to hire African-American assistant coaches.

Another Hayes' recruit, [[Archie Griffin]], was the only two-time [[Heisman Trophy]] winner in seven decades of selections. Altogether, Hayes had 58 players earn [[All-America]] honors under his tutelage. Many notable football coaches, such as [[Lou Holtz]], [[Bill Arnsparger]], [[Bill Mallory]], [[Dick Crum (football coach)|Dick Crum]], [[Bo Schembechler]], [[Ara Parseghian]] and Woody's successor, [[Earle Bruce]], served as his assistants at various times.

Hayes would often use illustrations from historical events to make a point in his coaching and teaching. When Hayes was first hired to be the head coach at Ohio State, he was also made a "full professor of physical education", having earned an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in educational administration from Ohio State in 1948. The classes that he taught on campus were usually full, and he was called "Professor Hayes" by students. Hayes also taught mandatory English and [[vocabulary]] classes to his freshman football players. One of his students was a basketball player named [[Bobby Knight]], who was to become a legendary basketball coach.

During his time at Ohio State, Hayes' relationships with students faculty members were particularly good. Even those members of the faculty who believed that the role of [[intercollegiate athletics]] was growing out of control respected Hayes personally for his commitment to academics, the standards of integrity with which he ran his program, and the genuine enthusiasm he brought to his hobby as an amateur historian. Hayes often ate lunch or dinner at the university's faculty club, interacting with faculty and administrators.

As a coach and an educator, Hayes was one of the first to use the [[motion picture]] as a teaching and learning tool.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} He was also memorable in that he could be seen walking across campus, taking the time to visit with students.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} When talking to young people, Hayes treated all with respect, without regard to race or socio-economic class.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} This behavior by Hayes was helpful to Ohio State to quell the violence and damage from anti-war demonstrations that other college campuses suffered in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He would actually take the time to communicate with student leaders. Then-team quarterback [[Rex Kern]] said, "Woody was out there on the Oval with the protesters, and he'd grab a bullhorn and tell the students to express their beliefs but not be destructive. He believed in [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]], and he believed in [[the Establishment]], but he wasn't afraid to talk to the students. He wanted to stay close to the action."&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, ''op.cit''. pp.195-197&lt;/ref&gt; Hayes was considered one of the few authority figures that students then had respect for. His enthusiasm for coaching and winning was such that many across the nation consider the following maxim to be true: "What [[Vince Lombardi]] was to professional football, Woody Hayes was to college football."{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

During his tenure at Ohio State, Hayes would joke that he considered himself to be [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]]'s best recruiter because if he could not convince a recruit to come to Ohio State instead of Michigan he would try to steer the recruit to Notre Dame, whom Ohio State did not play. While Hayes' public stance was that he refused to play Notre Dame because he was afraid of polarizing the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] population in Ohio, Notre Dame's long-time athletic director [[Moose Krause|Edward "Moose" Krause]] said that Hayes had told him that Hayes liked having Michigan as the only tough game on the Ohio State schedule and that having the Buckeyes play Notre Dame would detract from that.&lt;ref&gt;

After losses or ties, Hayes would conduct locker room interviews while naked. A journalist from his tenure noted, "He was an ugly guy so it would clear the locker room out pretty fast."&lt;ref name=CPD021209&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/osu/index.ssf/2009/02/leonard_downie_jr_regrettably.html Leonard Downie Jr. regrettably recalls Woody Hayes holding interviews while naked], ''Cleveland Plain Dealer'', February 12, 2009, Accessed February 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TL021209&gt;Richard Oviatt, [http://media.www.thelantern.com/media/storage/paper333/news/2009/02/12/Campus/Washington.Post.Editor.Leonard.Downie.Jr.Talks.Past.Future-3625084.shtml Washington Post editor Leonard Downie Jr. talks past, future] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215165400/http://media.www.thelantern.com/media/storage/paper333/news/2009/02/12/Campus/Washington.Post.Editor.Leonard.Downie.Jr.Talks.Past.Future-3625084.shtml |date=2009-02-15 }}, ''The Lantern'', February 12, 2009, Accessed February 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In 1959, following a 17−0 loss to [[USC Trojans football|USC]], Hayes threw a punch at ''[[Los Angeles Examiner]]'' sportswriter Al Bine, but missed, and punched the brother of ''Pasadena Independent'' sports editor Bob Shafer in the back instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Didn't Punch Scribe, Woody Hayes Insists |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W-EyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dQAGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4708,328808 |newspaper=Sunday Herald |date=October 4, 1959 |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 1965 meeting of Big Ten Conference athletic directors and coaches, Hayes nearly started a fight with [[Iowa Hawkeyes|Iowa's]] athletic director, [[Forest Evashevski]], before being restrained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hayes, Evashevski Nearly Come To Blows At Meeting |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=saZfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VzIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6124,3370355 |newspaper=[[Lewiston Morning Tribune]] |date=May 21, 1965 |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Hayes team won a game against rival [[1968 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], 50–14.  Late in that game, Ohio State held a commanding 44–14 advantage and scored one final touchdown. Rather than taking the more common [[extra point]] kick, Hayes instead opted for a [[two-point conversion]], but was unsuccessful, leading many football fans to believe that Hayes was [[running up the score]]. When asked later why he went for two points, Hayes said, "Because they wouldn’t let me go for three.”

Prior to the [[1973 Rose Bowl]], Hayes shoved a camera into the face of a news photographer. As a result, Hayes was suspended for three games, fined $2,000, and left California with a [[subpoena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Strode, George |title=Despite Many Outbursts Woody Hayes Has Humanitarian Side Seldom Publicized |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=keFIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ioIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2432,2505387 |newspaper=[[Youngstown Vindicator]] |date=January 7, 1973 |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, a late fumble at Michigan caused him to charge at [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] cameraman Mike Freedman, who recorded his frustration; Hayes was [[ejection (sports)|ejected]], put on [[probation]] by the Big Ten Conference, and fined $2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mooshil, Joe |title=Duke Puts Woody on Probation |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3nIyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YawFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2690,3281794 |newspaper=[[The Argus-Press]] |date=December 3, 1977 |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1962 Rose Bowl vote===
In the 1961 season, Ohio State won the Big Ten championship, qualifying automatically for the Rose Bowl. At the time, the Big Ten Conference rules stated that the school's Faculty Council must officially approve of the trip. In this unusual development, the Ohio State Faculty Council voted 28 to 25 against the [[1962 Rose Bowl]] trip, prompted by the head of a university alumni group, on the grounds that the school's academic reputation was suffering because of over-emphasis on the football team. Other reports stated that the bid was declined because Ohio State had already beaten their would-be Rose Bowl opponent, [[University of California at Los Angeles|UCLA]], during the regular season. The decision sparked minor rioting on the Ohio State Campus and in the Columbus area. The ''[[Columbus Dispatch]]'' published the names, addresses, and phone numbers of those Faculty Council Members who voted against the trip as well as the amount of university money that they spent on the trips. While Hayes was diplomatic with some faculty members who voted against the trip and urged the students to cease complaining, he did not spare his criticism of the alumni club president who led the charge against accepting the bowl bid.&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, ''op.cit''. pp.142-145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comments on the My Lai Massacre===

Speaking at a football [[banquet]] in 1969, Hayes spoke about the recently revealed [[My Lai Massacre]].  He stated that the Vietnamese men in My Lai deserved to die, "and I wouldn't be so sure those women were innocent.  The children are obviously innocent – if they are less than five."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woody Waves His Flag |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19691212&amp;id=Es4bAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fVAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7306,5888738 |newspaper=[[The Pittsburgh Press]] |date=December 12, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confrontation with Jerry Markbreit===
Late in the 1971 rivalry game against [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], furious over what he thought was a missed defensive [[pass interference]] foul committed by [[Thom Darden]] of Michigan, Hayes stormed onto the field, launched a profanity-laced tirade at referee [[Jerry Markbreit]], and tore up the sideline markers, receiving a 15-yard [[unsportsmanlike conduct]] penalty. Hayes then threw the penalty flag into the crowd, began destroying the yard markers, and threw the first-down marker into the ground like a [[javelin]] before being restrained by Buckeyes team officials; Hayes was then assessed an additional 15-yard penalty and ejected. Hayes was suspended for one game and fined $1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woody Hayes Still Fuming Grid's 'Worst Called Play' |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=n6hIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FQENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3884,3100903 |newspaper=[[The Morning Record]] |date=November 23, 1971 |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;



===1978 Gator Bowl incident and dismissal===
On December 29, 1978, the Buckeyes played in the [[1978 Gator Bowl|Gator Bowl]] against [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]]. Late in the fourth quarter, Clemson was leading Ohio State 17–15. Freshman quarterback [[Art Schlichter]] managed to get Ohio State into field goal range. On third and 5 at the Clemson 24-yard line with 2:30 left and the clock running, Hayes called a pass rather than a run, because Schlichter was having a great game up to that point. Schlichter's next pass was intercepted by Clemson [[nose guard]] Charlie Bauman, who returned it toward the Ohio State sideline, where he was run out of bounds. After Bauman got back up, Hayes punched him in the throat, triggering a [[bench-clearing brawl]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEVJyf0ft3I&lt;/ref&gt; Hayes stormed onto the field and was abusive towards the referee. When one of Hayes' own players, offensive lineman, [[Ken Fritz]], tried to intervene, Hayes turned on him and had to be restrained by defensive coordinator George Hill. The Buckeyes were assessed two 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties for Hayes' attack on Bauman and his abuse towards the referee. Bauman was not injured by Hayes' punch and shrugged the incident off. Even though the game was being telecast by ABC, announcers [[Keith Jackson]] and [[Ara Parseghian]] did not comment about the punch. (At the time, all non-press box cameras were operated remotely from another site, and Jackson allegedly did not actually witness the punch, his view of the sidelines being blocked by the upper tier of the stadium).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

After the game, Ohio State Athletic Director Hugh Hindman, who had played for Hayes at Miami of Ohio, and had been an assistant under him for seven years, privately confronted Hayes in the Buckeye locker room. He said that he intended to tell school president [[Harold Leroy Enarson|Harold Enarson]] about what happened, and strongly implied that Hayes had coached his last game at Ohio State. After a heated exchange, Hindman said that he then offered Hayes a chance to resign, but Hayes refused, saying, "That would make it too easy for you. You had better go ahead and fire me." Hindman then met with Enarson at a [[country club]] near [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], and the two agreed that Hayes had to go.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1094478/index.htm Scorecard]. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', 1979-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Woody Hayes's last stand: Ohio State, Clemson and the punch that ruined Hayes |url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2016/12/23/woody-hayes-punch-clemson-ohio-state |publisher=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next morning, Hindman told Hayes that he had been fired. A press conference was held at the hotel where the team had been staying. The team returned to Columbus around noon, and Hayes left the airport in a police car. Regarding Hayes' dismissal, Enarson said that "there isn't a university or athletic conference in this country that would permit a coach to physically assault a college athlete."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', 12-31-1978, pg.S1&lt;/ref&gt; After the incident, Hayes reflected on his career by saying, "Nobody despises to lose more than I do. That's got me into trouble over the years, but it also made a man of mediocre ability into a pretty good coach." About two months after the incident, Hayes called Bauman in his dorm room, but did not apologize for his previous attack on him. [[Earle Bruce]] succeeded Hayes as Ohio State's head coach.

Many years later, [[Leonard Downie, Jr.]], former executive editor of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and student journalist at Ohio State, said he regretted not reporting an incident in the 1960s where Hayes instructed a player to take off his helmet and then hit him in the head.&lt;ref name="TL021209"/&gt;

According to the 1994 [[Home Box Office|HBO]] documentary ''American Coaches: Men of Vision and Victory'', Hindman had placed Hayes on notice at the beginning of the 1978 season, not just for the swing at the ABC cameraman during the 1977 Michigan game, but also for hitting a player during a practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=American Coaches: Men of Vision and Victory |author=HBO Sports |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his 1989 autobiography, Michigan's [[Bo Schembechler]] wrote that he believed Hayes, who was [[diabetes|diabetic]] and may have had a high [[blood sugar]] level, didn’t believe he struck Bauman. Schembechler also pointed out that Hayes had maintained that all he was trying to do was grab the ball away.&lt;ref&gt;Schembechler &amp; Albom.  p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before and after the dismissal incident, Hayes was a professor of Military History at Ohio State. His office was in the ROTC building, Converse Hall, across the street from Ohio Stadium. For the remainder of his years at OSU, he continued to teach and mentor students.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Final days and death==
On March 11, 1987, Hayes was clearly in failing health when he had someone drive him in his pickup truck to [[Dayton]] to introduce [[Bo Schembechler]], who was speaking at a banquet. Organizers had tried to discourage Hayes from attending, but Hayes insisted. He gave a lengthy introduction to Schembechler and then stayed to hear him speak before being driven back home.&lt;ref&gt;Schembechler &amp; Albom.  p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next morning, March 12, Hayes's wife Anne found him unconscious in his bed at the couple's home.&lt;ref name=Folkart&gt;Burt A.

==Legacy==
Hayes's lifetime record of 238–72–10 placed him ninth in all-time [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Division I FBS coaching victories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.org/library/records/football/football_records_book/2007/2007_d1_football_records_book.pdf|title=page 383|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201142013/http://www.ncaa.org/library/records/football/football_records_book/2007/2007_d1_football_records_book.pdf|archivedate=2007-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1983.

At Hayes's [[funeral]] at First Community Church in Grandview, Ohio on March 17, 1987, [[President of the United States|former president]] [[Richard Nixon]] delivered the eulogy before a crowd of 1,400, acknowledging the friendship that had begun between the two during his second term as [[U.S. Vice President|vice president]]. Having met Hayes at a reception following a Buckeye win over Iowa in 1957, Nixon recalled, "I wanted to talk about [[American football|football]]. Woody wanted to talk about [[foreign policy]]. And you know Woody—we talked about foreign policy."&lt;ref&gt;Nixon, Richard M. [http://www.dispatch.com/content/blogs/a-look-back/2012/03/remembering-woody-hayes.html "A Tribute to Woody Hayes"], March 17, 1987, quoted in ''[[Columbus Dispatch]]'', March 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, more than 15,000 people took part in a [[funeral|memorial service]] at [[Ohio Stadium]].

Hayes's commitment to academics at Ohio State was evidenced by his request that donations from his family, friends, and supporters be made to the academic side of the university. Following his death and in keeping with his wishes, the Wayne Woodrow Hayes Chair in National Security Studies was established at Ohio State's [[Mershon Center for International Security Studies]]. Professor [[John Mueller]] currently holds the chair. In November 1987, the university dedicated the new [[Woody Hayes Athletic Center]] in his memory.

==Personal life==
Hayes married the former Anne Gross in 1942. Anne Hayes was a formidable and popular woman in her own right, who used to jokingly say at numerous sports banquets, "Divorce Woody? Never! But there were plenty of times I wanted to murder him!"&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, ''op.cit''. p.40&lt;/ref&gt;  The couple had one son, Steven, who went on to become a lawyer and judge. Coincidentally, the younger Hayes would be assigned to the 2003 trial of former Ohio State standout [[Maurice Clarett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=1618719|title=Clarett case judge is Woody Hayes' son|date=18 September 2003|website=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II movie host===
Because of his knowledge of military history and ongoing popularity, Hayes in the early 1980s hosted the broadcast of six World War II films for [[WBNS-TV]] in Columbus, which has served as the official outlet of Ohio State sports media programming for years, including the football coach's shows. Among the movies broadcast were ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'', ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'', ''[[The Wackiest Ship in the Army (film)|The Wackiest Ship in the Army]]'', ''[[The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel]]'', and ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]''

Hayes would also give salty historical perspectives related to each movie. Hayes' segments, depending upon the movie, were taped in such locations as [[Fort Knox]], [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], the {{USS|Yorktown|CV-10|6}}, and [[Stuttgart]], Germany, where he interviewed [[Manfred Rommel]], Lord Mayor of Stuttgart and the son of [[Erwin Rommel]].

'''Workplace bullying''' is a persistent pattern of mistreatment from others in the workplace that causes either physical or emotional harm.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C. &amp; Keashley, L. (2005). Bullying at work: A perspective from Britain and North America. In S. Fox &amp; P. E. Spector (eds.) Counterproductive work behaviour: Investigations of actors and targets (pp. 271-296). Washington DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;  It can include such tactics as [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[nonverbal]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]], [[physical abuse|physical]] abuse and [[humiliation]]. This type of [[workplace aggression]] is particularly difficult because, unlike the typical [[school bullying|school bully]], workplace bullies often operate within the established rules and policies of their organization and their society. In the majority of cases, [[bullying]] in the workplace is reported as having been by someone who has authority over their victim. However, bullies can also be peers, and occasionally subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C., &amp; Cooper, C. L. (2006). Workplace Bullying. In Kelloway, E., Barling, J. &amp; Hurrell Jr., J. (eds.), Handbook of workplace violence (pp. 47-90). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also investigated the impact of the larger organizational context on bullying as well as the group-level processes that impact on the incidence and maintenance of bullying behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, S., Troth, A &amp; Branch, S . (2010). Work-place bullying: A group processes framework ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology'', 84(4), 799-816.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying can be covert or overt. It may be missed by superiors; it may be known by many throughout the organization.  Negative effects are not limited to the targeted individuals, and may lead to a decline in [[employee morale]] and a change in [[organizational culture]].&lt;ref name=SilentEpidemic&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201105/the-silent-epidemic-workplace-bullying |title=The Silent Epidemic: Workplace Bullying |last=Williams |first=Ray |work=Psychology Today |date=3 May 2011 |accessdate=2016-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20151121235011/https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201105/the-silent-epidemic-workplace-bullying |archivedate=21 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also take place as overbearing supervision, constant criticism, and they may work at hospice

==First known documented use==
The first known documented use of "workplace bullying" is in 1992 in a book by [[Andrea Adams]] called ''Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It''.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=workplace+bullying&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1990&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2Cworkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bworkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BWorkplace%20Bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BWorkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0 Google ngrams]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Adams|Adams, Andrea]] with contributions from Crawford, Neil ''Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
While there is no universally accepted formal definition of workplace bullying, several researchers have endeavoured to define it:
* According to Einarsen, Hoel, Zapf and Cooper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bullying and emotional abuse in the workplace: International perspectives in research and practice|authors=Stale Einarsen, Helge Hoel, Cary Cooper|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London|date=2003|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Bullying at work means harassing, offending, socially excluding someone or negatively affecting someone’s work tasks. In order for the label bullying (or mobbing) to be applied to a particular activity, interaction or process it has to occur repeatedly and regularly (e.g. weekly) and over a period of time (e.g. about six months). Bullying is an escalated process in the course of which the person confronted ends up in an inferior position and becomes the target of systematic negative social acts."

* Employers can also be bullies. Bad employers use bullying strategically to rid the workplace of good employees to avoid a legal obligation, such as paying [[unemployment compensation]] or a worker's compensation claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abusergoestowork.com/employers-that-bully/|title=Lost in Discussion: Employers that Bully|date=4 July 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170319123420/http://abusergoestowork.com/employers-that-bully/|archivedate=19 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employers also use bullying tactics to drive out employees who demand legal pay or overtime or assert a legal right to organize collectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abusergoestowork.com/workplace-bullying-the-big-picture/|title=Workplace Bullying: The Big Picture|date=25 November 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170318001323/http://abusergoestowork.com/workplace-bullying-the-big-picture/|archivedate=18 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common type of complaint filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission involves retaliation, where an employer harasses or bullies an employee for objecting to illegal discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/charges.cfm|title=Charge Statistics|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317054201/https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/charges.cfm|archivedate=17 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Barnes, author of ''Surviving Bullies, Queen Bees &amp; Psychopaths in the Workplace'', argues that employers that bully are a critical but often overlooked aspect of the problem in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Patricia G. (2012), "Surviving Bullies, Queen Bees &amp; Psychopaths in the Workplace." {{ISBN|978-0-615-64241-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it can occur in a variety of contexts and forms, it is also useful to define workplace bullying by the key features that these behaviours possess. Bullying is characterized by:&lt;ref&gt;Einarsen, 1999; Keashly &amp; Harvey 2004; Lutgen-Sandvik, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* Repetition (occurs regularly)
* Duration (is enduring)
* Escalation (increasing aggression)
* [[Power (social and political)|Power]] disparity (the target lacks the power to successfully defend themselves)
* Attributed intent

This distinguishes bullying from isolated behaviours and other forms of [[Occupational stress|job stress]] and allows the term workplace bullying to be applied in various contexts and to behaviours that meet these characteristics. Many observers agree that bullying is often a repetitive behaviour. However, some experts who have dealt with a great many people who report abuse also categorize some once-only events as bullying, for example with cases where there appear to be severe sequelae.&lt;ref&gt;See: Thomas Sebok and Mary Chavez Rudolph, "Cases Involving Allegations of Workplace Bullying: Threats to Ombuds Neutrality and Other Challenges," JIOA, 2010, vol.3, no 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding the common understanding of bullying to include single, severe episodes also parallels the legal definitions of sexual harassment in the US.

According to Pamela Lutgin-Sandvik,&lt;ref name="cycle"&gt;Lutgin-Sandvik, Pamela, [http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/undergraduate/pdf/TheCommunicativeCycleofEmployeeEmotionalAbuse-GenerationandRegenerationofWorkplaceMistreatme.pdf The Communicative Cycle of Employee Emotional Abuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612011734/http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/undergraduate/pdf/TheCommunicativeCycleofEmployeeEmotionalAbuse-GenerationandRegenerationofWorkplaceMistreatme.pdf |date=12 June 2010 }}, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of unifying language to name the phenomenon of workplace bullying is a problem because without a unifying term or phrase, individuals have difficulty naming their experiences of abuse, and therefore have trouble pursuing justice against the bully. Unlike sexual harassment, which named a specific problem and is now recognized in law of many countries (including U.S.), workplace bullying is still being established as a relevant social problem and is in need of a specific vernacular.

Euphemisms intended to trivialize bullying and its impact on bullied people include: incivility, disrespect, difficult people, personality conflict, negative conduct, and ill treatment.  Bullied people are labelled as insubordinate when they resist the bullying treatment.

There is no exact definition for bullying behaviours in workplace, which is why different terms and definitions are common. For example, mobbing is a commonly used term in France and Germany, where it refers to a "mob" of bullies, rather than a single bully; this phenomenon is not often seen in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;LEYMANN, H., 1990. Mobbing and Psychological Terror at Workplaces. Violence and victims, 5(2), pp. 119-126&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2015}} In the United States, aggression and emotional abuse are frequently used terms, whereas harassment is the term preferred in Finland.

== Statistics ==
Bosses are the most common bullies. In fact, approximately 72% of bullies outrank their victims.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Kinsey Goman, “Is Your Boss a Bully?” Forbes, April 6, 2014, {{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918173233/https://www.forbes.com/sites/ |archivedate=18 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }} carolkinseygoman/2014/04/06/is-your-boss-a-bully/&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics&lt;ref name="genderstats"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.workplacebullying.org/research.html |title=The 2007 WBI-Zogby Survey |publisher=Workplacebullying.org |date=29 April 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107071240/http://www.workplacebullying.org/research.html |archivedate=7 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the 2007 WBI-Zogby survey show that 13% of U.S. employees report being bullied currently, 24% say they have been bullied in the past and an additional 12% say they have witnessed workplace bullying. Nearly half of all American workers (49%) report that they have been affected by workplace bullying, either being a target themselves or having witnessed abusive behaviour against a co-worker.

Although socioeconomic factors may play a role in the abuse, researchers from the Project for Wellness and Work-Life&lt;ref name="nightmares pp. 151-152"/&gt; suggest that "workplace bullying, by definition, is not explicitly connected to demographic markers such as sex and ethnicity".&lt;ref name="nightmares pp. 151-152"/&gt;  Because one in ten employees experiences workplace bullying, the prevalence of this issue is cause for great concern, even as initial data about this issue are reviewed.

According to the 2010 [[National Health Interview Survey#Research topics|National Health Interview Survey Occupational Health Supplement]] (NHIS-OHS), the national prevalence rate for workers reporting having been threatened, bullied, or harassed by anyone on the job was 8%.&lt;ref name = alterman1&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Alterman|first1= T|last2= Luckhaupt|first2= SE|last3= Dahlhamer|first3= JM|last4= Ward|first4= BW|last5= Calvert|first5= GM|title= Job insecurity, work-family imbalance, and hostile work environment: Prevalence data from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey|journal= Am J Ind Med|volume=56|issue=6|pages=660–669|date=June 2013| pmid=23023603|doi=10.1002/ajim.22123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Dr. Judy Fisher-Blando&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lentzleadership.com/index.php?page_name=dr.judy_blando |title=The Lentz Leadership Institute LLC |publisher=Lentzleadership.com |accessdate=2012-08-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808110739/http://www.lentzleadership.com/index.php?page_name=dr.judy_blando |archivedate=8 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a doctoral research dissertation on ''Aggressive behaviour: Workplace Bullying and Its Effect on Job Satisfaction and Productivity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workplaceviolence911.com/docs/20081215.pdf |title=Workplace Bullying: Aggressive Behavior and its effect on Job Satisfaction and Productivity |last=Fisher-Blando| first=Judith Lynn|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019123522/http://www.workplaceviolence911.com/docs/20081215.pdf| archive-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific study determined that almost 75% of employees surveyed had been affected by workplace bullying, whether as a target or a witness. Further research showed the types of bullying behaviour, and organizational support.

=== Gender ===
In terms of gender, the Workplace Bullying Institute (2007)&lt;ref name="genderstats" /&gt; states that women appear to be at greater risk of becoming a bullying target, as 57% of those who reported being targeted for abuse were women. Men are more likely to participate in aggressive bullying behaviour (60%), however when the bully is a woman her target is more likely to be a woman as well (71%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/appointments/article6447287.ece |title=How a woman becomes a bully – The Sunday Times, June 7 |work=The Times |date=11 March 2012 |accessdate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611225342/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/appointments/article6447287.ece |archivedate=11 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the research of Samnani and Singh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Samnani|first1=Al-Karim|last2=Singh|first2=Parbudyal|title=Aggression and Violent Behavior|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|date=November–December 2012|volume=17|issue=6|pages=581–589|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2012.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2012), it concludes the findings from previous 20 years' literature and claims that in terms of the gender factor, inconsistent findings could not support the differences across gender.

In a study done by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nhis/|title=CDC - Worker Health Information from the National Health Interview Survey - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|author=|date=15 December 2017|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228145656/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nhis/|archivedate=28 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the NHIS-OHS confirms the previous finding, as higher prevalence rates for being threatened, bullied, or harassed were identified for women (9%) compared with men (7%).&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

=== Race ===

Race also may play a role in the experience of workplace bullying. According to the Workplace Bullying Institute (2007),&lt;ref name="genderstats" /&gt; the comparison of reported combined bullying (current + ever bullied) prevalence percentages reveals the pattern from most to least:
# Hispanics (52.1%)
# Blacks (46%)
# Whites (33.5%)
# Asian (30.6%)

The reported rates of witnessing bullying were:
# Asian (28.5%)
# Blacks (21.1%)
# Hispanics (14%)
# Whites (10.8%)

The percentages of those reporting that they have neither experienced nor witnessed mistreatment were:
# Asians (57.3%)
# Whites (49.7%)
# Hispanics (32.2%)
# Blacks (23.4%)

Research psychologist [[Tony Buon]] published one of the first reviews of bullying in China in the prestigious Journal PKU Business Review in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Buon, T (2005). The Management of Workplace Bullying. PKU Business Review, 5, 74-79, Peking University (PRC) (Published in Chinese){{cite web |url=.http://www.buon.net/PKUBullying.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709151722/http://www.buon.net/PKUBullying.pdf |archivedate=9 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marital status===
Higher prevalence rates for experiencing a [[hostile work environment]] were identified for divorced or separated workers compared to married workers, widowed workers, and never married workers.&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

===Education===
Higher prevalence rates for experiencing a hostile work environment were identified for workers with some college education or workers with  high school diploma or GED, compared to workers with less than a high school education.&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

===Age===
Lower prevalence rates for experiencing a hostile work environment were identified for workers aged 65 and older compared to workers in other age groups.&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

With respect to age, conflicting findings have been reported. A study by Einarsen and Skogstad (1996) indicates older employees tend to be more likely to be bullied than younger ones.

===Industry===
Among industry groups, workers with higher prevalence rates of a hostile work environment, compared to all adults employed at some time in a 12-month period leading up to a survey in 2010 (8%), were in public administration (16%) and retail trade industries (10%). Lower prevalence rates of a hostile work environment were reported among those working in construction (5%); finance and insurance (5%); manufacturing (5%); and professional, scientific, and technical services industries (6%).&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

===Occupation===
For occupational groups, workers in protective service reported a higher prevalence rate (25%) of hostile work environments compared to the prevalence rate for all adults employed at some time in the past 12 months. Workers in community and social service occupations also experienced a relatively high rate (16%). Lower prevalence rates were observed among architecture and engineering (4%), computer and mathematical (4%), business and financial operations (5%), and construction and extraction (5%) occupations.&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

== Profiling ==
Researchers Caitlin Buon and [[Tony Buon]] have suggested that attempts to profile ‘the bully’ have been damaging &lt;ref name="buon.net"&gt;Buon T &amp; Buon, C (2007) The Bully Within. Counselling at Work. Summer {{cite web |url=http://buon.net/BullyingJournalArticle.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150510100132/http://buon.net/BullyingJournalArticle.pdf |archivedate=10 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They state that the "bully" profile is that ‘the bully’ is always aware of what they are doing, deliberately sets out to harm their ‘victims’, targets a particular individual or type of person and has some kind of underlying personality flaw, insecurity or disorder. But this is unproven and lacks evidence. The researchers suggest referring to workplace bullying as generic harassment along with other forms of non-specific harassment and this would enable employees to use less emotionally charged language and start a dialogue about their experiences rather than being repelled by the spectre of being labelled as a pathological predator or having to define their experiences as the victims of such a person. [[Tony Buon]] and Caitlin Buon also suggest that the perception and profile of the workplace bully is not facilitating  interventions with the problem. They suggest that to make significant progress and achieve behaviour change over the long term then, organisations and individuals need to embrace the notion that everyone must all potentially house ‘the bully’ within them and their organisations. It exists in workplace cultures, belief systems, interactions  and  emotional competencies and cannot be transformed if externalization and demonization continue the problem by profiling ‘the bully’ rather than talking about behaviours and interpersonal  interactions.&lt;ref name="buon.net"/&gt;

== Relationship among participants ==
Based on research by H. Hoel and C.L. Cooper, most the perpetrators are [[supervisor]]s. The second most common group is peers, followed by subordinates and customers.&lt;ref&gt;HOEL, H. and COOPER, C.L., 2000. Destructive conflict and bullying at work. Manchester School of Management, UMIST Manchester, UK., http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0950017010389228&lt;/ref&gt; The three main relationships among the participants in workplace bullying: 
* Between supervisor and subordinate
* Among co-workers
* Employees and customers

Bullying may also occur between an organization and its employees.

Bullying behaviour by supervisors toward subordinates typically manifests as an abuse of power by the supervisor in the workplace. Bullying behaviours by supervisors may be associated with a culture of bullying and the management style of the supervisors. An authoritative management style, specifically, often includes bullying behaviours, which can make subordinates fearful and allow supervisors to bolster their authority over others.

On the other hand, some researchers suggest that bullying behaviours can be a positive force for performance in the workplace. Workplace bullying may contribute to organizational power and control.

However, if an organization wishes to discourage bullying in the workplace, strategies and policies must be put into place to dissuade and counter bullying behavior. Lack of monitoring or of punishment/corrective action will result in an organizational culture that supports/tolerates bullying.

In addition to supervisor – subordinate bullying, bullying behaviours also occur between colleagues. Peers can be either the target or perpetrator. If workplace bullying happens among the co-workers, witnesses will typically choose sides, either with the target or the perpetrator. Perpetrators usually "win" since witnesses do not want to be the next target. This outcome encourages perpetrators to continue their bullying behaviour. In addition, the sense of the injustice experienced by a target might lead that person to become another perpetrator who bullies other colleagues who have less power than they do, thereby proliferating bullying in the organization.

Maarit Varitia, a workplace bullying researcher, found that 20% of interviewees who experienced workplace bullying attributed their being targeted to their differences from others.&lt;ref&gt;MAARIT VARTIA, 1996. The sources of bullying–psychological work environment and organizational climate. European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, 5(2), pp. 203-214&lt;/ref&gt;

The third relationship in the workplace is between employees and customers. Although less frequent, such cases play a significant role in the efficiency of the organization. Overly stressed or distressed employees may be less able to perform optimally and can impact the quality of service overall.

The fourth relationship in the workplace is between the organization or system and its employees. An article by Andreas Liefooghe (2012) notes that many employees describe their employer as a "bully."

These cases, the issue is not simply an organizational culture or environmental factors facilitating bullying, but bullying-like behaviour by an employer against an employee. Tremendous power imbalances between an organization and its employees enables the employer to "legitimately exercise" power (e.g., by monitoring and controlling employees) in a manner consistent with bullying.

Although the terminology of bullying traditionally implies an interpersonal relationship between the perpetrator and target, organizations' or other collectives' actions can constitute bullying both by definition and in their impacts on targets. However, while defining bullying as an interpersonal phenomenon is considered legitimate, classifying incidences of employer exploitation, retaliation, or other abuses of power against an employee as a form of bullying is often not taken as seriously.

== Organizational culture ==
{{Main|Organizational culture|Bullying culture}}
Bullying is seen to be prevalent in organizations where employees and managers feel that
they have the support, or at least the implicit blessing of senior managers to carry on their abusive
and bullying behaviour.&lt;ref name=SilentEpidemic/&gt; Furthermore, new managers will quickly come to view this form of behaviour as
acceptable and normal if they see others get away with it and are even rewarded for it.&lt;ref name="Salin D 2010"&gt;Salin D, Helge H "Organizational Causes of Workplace Bullying" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

When bullying happens at the highest levels, the effects may be far reaching. People may be bullied irrespective of their organizational status or rank, including senior managers, which indicates the possibility of a negative domino effect, where bullying may cascade downwards, as the targeted supervisors might offload their own [[aggression]] onto their subordinates. In such situations, a bullying scenario in the [[boardroom]] may actually threaten the [[productivity]] of the entire organisation.&lt;ref name=Organisational&gt;Helge H, Sheehan MJ, Cooper CL, Einarsen S "Organisational Effects of Workplace Bullying" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographical culture ==
{{Main|Culture}}
Research investigating the acceptability of the bullying behaviour across different cultures (e.g.g Power et al., 2013) clearly shows that culture matters here. One's culture affects the perception of the acceptable behaviour. 
One's national background also influences the prevalence of workplace bullying (Harvey et al., 2009; Hoel et al., 1999; Lutgen-Sandvik et al., 2007).

Humane orientation is negatively associated with the acceptability of bullying for WRB (Work related bullying).
Performance orientation is positively associated with the acceptance of bullying. Future orientation is negatively associated with the acceptability of bullying. A culture of femininity suggests that individuals who live and work in this kind of culture tend to value [[interpersonal relationships]] to a greater degree.

Three broad dimensions  have been mentioned in relation to workplace bullying: power distance; masculinity versus femininity; and [[individualism]] versus [[collectivism]] (Lutgen-Sandvik et al., 2007).

In Confucian Asia, which has a higher performance orientation than Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, bullying may be seen as an acceptable price to pay for performance. The value Latin America holds for personal connections with employees and the higher humane orientation of Sub-Saharan Africa may help to explain their distaste for bullying. A culture of individualism in the US implies competition, which may increase the likelihood of workplace bullying situations.

==Culture of fear==
{{Main|Culture of fear}}
Ashforth discussed potentially destructive sides of [[leadership]] and identified what he referred to as [[petty tyrants]], i.e., leaders who exercise a tyrannical style of management, resulting in a climate of fear in the workplace.&lt;ref name=ashforth&gt;''Petty tyranny in organizations '', Ashforth, Blake, Human Relations, Vol. 47, No. 7, 755-778 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Partial or intermittent negative [[reinforcement]] can create an effective climate of fear and [[doubt]].&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When employees get the sense that bullies "get away with it," a climate of fear may be the result.&lt;ref name="Organisational"/&gt; Several studies have confirmed a relationship between bullying, on the one hand, and an autocratic leadership and an authoritarian way of settling [[Workplace conflict|conflicts]] or dealing with disagreements, on the other. An authoritarian style of leadership may create a climate of fear, where there is little or no room for dialogue and where complaining may be considered futile.&lt;ref name="Salin D 2010"/&gt;

In a study of public-sector union members, approximately one in five workers reported having considered [[Turnover (employment)|leaving]] the workplace as a result of witnessing bullying taking place. Rayner explained these figures by pointing to the presence of a climate of fear in which employees considered reporting to be unsafe, where bullies had "got away with it" previously despite management knowing of the presence of bullying.&lt;ref name=Organisational/&gt;

==Kiss up kick down==
{{Main|Kiss up kick down}}
The workplace bully is often expert at knowing how to work the system. They can spout all the current management buzzwords about supportive management but basically use it as a cover. By keeping their abusive behaviour hidden, any charges made by individuals about his or her bullying will always come down to your word against his. They may have a ''kiss up kick down'' personality, wherein they are always highly cooperative, respectful, and caring when talking to upper management but the opposite when it comes to their relationship with those whom they supervise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/workplace/2010-12-28-bullyboss28_CV_N.htm | last=Petrecca |first= Laura |date=27 Dec 2010| title= Bullying by the boss is common but hard to fix. |work=USA Today | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160307090535/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/workplace/2010-12-28-bullyboss28_CV_N.htm |archive-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullies tend to [[ingratiate]] themselves to their bosses while [[intimidating]] subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftlocal1904.org/bully_workshop.pdf |title= How to manage a bully boss - Council of NJ State College Locals, AFT |date=15 Oct 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313114139/http://aftlocal1904.org/bully_workshop.pdf| archive-date=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/mary-donohue/bad-managers_b_4017881.html | last=Donohue | first=Mary |title=Fighting Back Against the Tyranny of the Manager|date=10 Feb 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091303/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/mary-donohue/bad-managers_b_4017881.html | archive-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be socially popular with others in management, including those who will determine
their fate. Often, a workplace bully will have mastered ''kiss up kick down'' tactics that hide their abusive side from superiors who review their performance.&lt;ref&gt;DC Yamada (2008) Workplace bullying and ethical leadership - Journal of Values-Based Leadership, Vol. 1, No. 2, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

* A bully creates an unnatural work environment where people constantly walk on eggshells and are compelled to behave in ways they normally would not

==Fight or flight==
{{Main|Fight-or-flight response}}
The most typical reactions to workplace bullying are to do with the survival instinct – "fight or flight" – and
these are probably a victim's healthier responses to bullying. Flight is a legitimate and valid response to bullying. It is very common, especially in organizations in which upper management cannot or will not deal with the bullying. In hard economic times, however, flight may not be an option, and fighting may be the only choice.&lt;ref name=Killoren&gt;Robert Killoren (2014) The Toll of Workplace Bullying - Research Management Review, Volume 20, Number 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighting the bullying can require near heroic action, especially if the bullying targets just one or two individuals. It can also be a difficult challenge. There are some times when confrontation is called for. First, there is always a chance that the bully boss is labouring under the impression that this is the way to get things done and does not recognize the havoc being wrought on subordinates.&lt;ref name=Killoren/&gt;

== Typology of bullying behaviours ==
With some variations, the following typology of workplace bullying behaviours has been adopted by a number of academic researchers. The typology uses five different categories.&lt;ref name="Rayner"&gt;Rayner C, Hoel H, [[Cary Cooper|Cooper CL]] Workplace Bullying: What we know, who is to blame and what can we do? (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Peyton"&gt;Peyton PR Dignity at Work: Eliminate Bullying and Create a Positive Working Environment (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Threat to professional status''' – including belittling opinions, public professional [[humiliation]], accusations regarding lack of effort, intimidating use of [[discipline]] or competence procedures.
# '''Threat to personal standing''' – including [[Social undermining|undermining]] personal integrity, destructive [[innuendo]] and [[sarcasm]], making inappropriate jokes about the target, persistent [[teasing]], name calling, [[insults]], [[intimidation]].
# '''[[Isolation to facilitate abuse|Isolation]]''' – including preventing access to opportunities, physical or social isolation, withholding necessary information, keeping the target out of the loop, ignoring or [[Social exclusion|excluding]].
# '''Overwork''' – including undue pressure, impossible deadlines, unnecessary disruptions.
# '''[[Destabilisation]]''' – including failure to acknowledge good work, allocation of meaningless tasks, removal of responsibility, repeated reminders of blunders, [[setting up to fail|setting target up to fail]], [[Moving the goalposts|shifting goal posts]] without telling the target.

==Tactics==
Research by the Workplace Bullying Institute, suggests that the following are the 25 most common workplace bullying tactics:&lt;ref name=namie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workplacebullying.org/2013/04/19/top-25 |title=Workplace Bullying Institute Top 25 workplace bullying tactics|publisher=Workplacebullying.org |date=29 April 2011 |accessdate=2015-03-26| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808074613/http://www.workplacebullying.org/top-25/ |archive-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abusive workplace behaviours ==
According to Bassman, common abusive workplace behaviours are:&lt;ref&gt;Bassman ES Abuse in the workplace: management remedies and bottom line impact (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[respect|Disrespecting]] and [[Idealization and devaluation|devaluing]] the individual, often through disrespectful and devaluing language or [[verbal abuse]]
# Overwork and devaluation of personal life (particularly salaried workers who are not compensated)
# [[Harassment]] through [[micromanagement]] of tasks and time
# Over evaluation and [[psychological manipulation|manipulating]] information (for example concentration on negative characteristics and failures, [[setting up to fail|setting up subordinate for failure]]).
# Managing by threat and [[intimidation]]
# [[plagiarism|Stealing credit]] and taking unfair advantage
# Preventing access to opportunities
# Downgrading an employee's capabilities to justify [[Layoff|downsizing]]
# Impulsive destructive behaviour

According to Hoel and [[Cary Cooper|Cooper]], common abusive workplace behaviours are:&lt;ref&gt;Hoel, H. &amp; [[Cary Cooper|Cooper, C.L]].

# Having key areas of responsibility removed or replaced with more trivial or unpleasant tasks.
Abusive cyberbullying in the workplace can have serious socioeconomic and psychological consequences on the victim. Workplace cyberbullying can lead to sick leave due to depression which in turn can lead to loss of profits for the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Randy A. Sancone &amp; Lori A.

=== Blue-collar jobs ===
Bullying has been identified as prominent in [[blue collar]] jobs including on the oil rigs, and in mechanical areas and machine shops, warehouses and factories. It is thought that [[intimidation]] and fear of [[retributive justice|retribution]] cause decreased incident reports, which, in the socioeconomic and cultural milieu of such industries, would likely lead to a [[vicious circle]]. This is often used in combination with [[psychological manipulation|manipulation]] and [[coercion]] of facts to gain favour among higher ranking [[administrator (business)|administrators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Notelaers |first=Guy |url=https://unimaas.academia.edu/GuyNotelaers/Papers/278637/Exploring_Risk_Groups_and_Risk_Factors_for_Workplace_Bullying |title=Exploring Risk Groups and Risk Factors for Workplace Bullying (Guy Notelaers) - Academia.edu |publisher=Unimaas.academia.edu |accessdate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425093442/http://unimaas.academia.edu/GuyNotelaers/Papers/278637/Exploring_Risk_Groups_and_Risk_Factors_for_Workplace_Bullying |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=April 2013}}

=== Medicine ===
{{Main|Bullying in medicine}}
Bullying in the [[medical profession]] is common, particularly of student or trainee doctors. It is thought that this is at least in part an outcome of conservative traditional [[Hierarchical organization|hierarchical structures]] and [[teaching methods]] in the medical profession which may result in a bullying cycle.

=== Nursing ===
{{Main|Bullying in nursing}}
Bullying has been identified as being particularly prevalent in the [[nursing]] [[profession]] although the reasons are not clear. It is thought that [[relational aggression]] (psychological aspects of bullying such as [[gossipping|gossiping]] and [[intimidation]]) are relevant. Relational aggression has been studied amongst girls but not so much amongst adult women.&lt;ref&gt;Richards A, Edwards SL A Nurse's Survival Guide to the Ward (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dellasega, C Bullying Among Nurses – American Journal of Nursing: January 2009 Volume 109 Issue 1 Pages 52–58&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teaching ===
{{Main|Bullying in teaching}}
School teachers are commonly the subject of bullying but they are also sometimes the originators of bullying within a school environment.

=== Legal profession ===
{{Main|Bullying in the legal profession}}
Bullying in the [[legal profession]] is believed to be more common than in some other professions. It is believed that its adversarial, hierarchical tradition contributes towards this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unswlawjournal.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/t1_le_mire_and_owens.pdf Le Mire, Suzanne; Owens, Rosemary ''A propitious moment?: Workplace bullying and regulation of the legal profession'' University of New South Wales Law Journal, The Volume 37 Issue 3 (Dec 2014)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201001112/http://www.unswlawjournal.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/t1_le_mire_and_owens.pdf |date=1 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women, trainees and solicitors who have been qualified for five years or less are more impacted, as are ethnic minority lawyers and lesbian, gay and bisexual lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalonline.co.uk/News/1009923.aspx#.VMfxpyzp-24 Society publishes guidance on tackling bullying in solicitor profession] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201001313/http://www.journalonline.co.uk/News/1009923.aspx |date=1 February 2015 }} The Journal of the Law Society of Scotland 27 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military ===
{{Main|Bullying in the military}}
Bullying exists to varying degrees in the [[military]] of some countries, often involving various forms of [[hazing]] or abuse by higher members of the [[military hierarchy]].

=== Volunteering ===

Bullying can be common in volunteering settings. For example, one study found bullying to be the most significant factor of complaints amongst volunteers

== Forms ==
[[Tim Field]] suggested that workplace bullying takes these forms:&lt;ref name="what"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bullyonline.org/workbully/bully.htm |last=Field |first=Tim |title=Bullying: what is it? | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512150521/http://bullyonline.org/index.php/bullying/15-am-i-being-bullied |archive-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Serial bullying''' — the source of all dysfunction can be traced to one individual, who picks on one employee after another and destroys them, then moves on. Probably the most common type of bullying.
* '''Secondary bullying''' — the pressure of having to deal with a serial bully causes the general behaviour to decline and sink to the lowest level.
* '''Pair bullying''' — this takes place with two people, one active and verbal, the other often watching and listening.
* '''Gang bullying or group bullying''' — is a serial bully with colleagues. Gangs can occur anywhere, but flourish in corporate bullying climates. It is often called [[mobbing]] and usually involves [[scapegoating]] and [[victimisation]].
* '''Vicarious bullying''' — two parties are encouraged to fight. This is the typical "[[Triangulation (psychology)|triangulation]]" where the aggression gets passed around.
* '''Regulation bullying''' — where a serial bully forces their target to comply with rules, regulations, procedures or laws regardless of their appropriateness, applicability or necessity.
* '''Residual bullying''' — after the serial bully has left or been fired, the behaviour continues. It can go on for years.
* '''[[Legal abuse|Legal bullying]] ''' — the bringing of a vexatious legal action to control and punish a person.
* '''Pressure bullying or unwitting bullying''' — having to work to unrealistic time scales or inadequate resources.
* '''Corporate bullying''' — where an employer abuses an employee with impunity, knowing the law is weak and the job market is soft.
* '''Organizational bullying''' — a combination of pressure bullying and corporate bullying. Occurs when an organization struggles to adapt to changing markets, reduced income, cuts in budgets, imposed expectations and other extreme pressures.
* '''Institutional bullying''' — entrenched and is accepted as part of the culture.
* '''Client bullying''' — an employee is bullied by those they serve, for instance subway attendants or public servants.
* '''[[Cyber bullying|Cyberbullying]]''' — the use of information and communication technologies to support deliberate, repeated, and hostile behaviour by an individual or group, that is intended to harm others.&lt;ref name=Summary5519228&gt;[https://www.srl.to/4hrEP8de Spacey, S. 2015. 1.

Adult bullying can come in an assortment of forms. There are about five distinctive types of adult bullies. A narcissistic bully is described as a self-centred person whose egotism is frail and possesses the need to put others down. An impulsive bully is someone who acts on bullying based on stress or being upset at the moment. A physical bully uses physical injury and the threat of harm to abuse their victims, while a verbal bully uses demeaning and cynicism to debase their victims. Lastly, a secondary adult bully is portrayed as a person that did not start the initial bullying but participates in afterwards to avoid being bullied themselves ("Adult Bullying").

{{Main|Bullying and emotional intelligence#Workplace}}
Workplace bullying is reported to be far more prevalent than perhaps commonly thought.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA&gt;Hutchinson, M. &amp; Hurley, J.

DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01372.x&lt;/ref&gt; For some reason, workplace bullying seems to be particularly widespread in healthcare organizations; 80% of nurses report experiencing workplace bullying.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; Similar to the school environment for children, the work environment typically places groups of adult peers together in a shared space on a regular basis. In such a situation, social interactions and relationships are of great importance to the function of the [[organizational structure]] and in pursuing [[goal]]s. The emotional consequences of bullying put an organization at risk of losing victimized employees.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; Bullying also contributes to a negative work environment, is not conducive to necessary cooperation and can lessen productivity at various levels.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; Bullying in the workplace is associated with negative responses to stress.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; The ability to manage emotions, especially emotional [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], seems to be a consistently important factor in different types of bullying. The workplace in general can be a stressful environment, so a negative way of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with stress or an inability to do so can be particularly damning. Workplace bullies may have high [[social intelligence]] and low [[emotional intelligence]] (EI).&lt;ref name=HutchinsonB&gt;Hutchinson, M.

== Related concepts  ==

=== Abusive supervision  ===
{{Main|Abusive supervision}}
Abusive supervision overlaps with workplace bullying in the workplace context. Research suggests that 75% of workplace bullying incidents are perpetrated by hierarchically superior agents. Abusive supervision differs from related constructs such as supervisor bullying and undermining in that it does not describe the intentions or objectives of the supervisor.&lt;ref name=Tepper&gt;Tepper BJ Abusive supervision in work organizations: Review, synthesis, and research agenda Journal of Management June 2007 Vol 33 no 3 P261-289&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Workplace mobbing ===
{{Main|Workplace mobbing}}
Workplace mobbing overlaps with workplace bullying. The concept originated from the study of animal behaviour. It concentrates on bullying by a group.

=== Workplace incivility ===
{{Main|Workplace incivility}}
Workplace bullying overlaps to some degree with workplace incivility but tends to encompass more intense and typically repeated acts of disregard and rudeness. Negative spirals of increasing incivility between organizational members can result in bullying,&lt;ref&gt;Beale, D. (2001). Monitoring bullying in the workplace. In N. Tehrani (Ed.), Building a culture of respect, managing bullying at work.&lt;/ref&gt; but isolated acts of incivility are not conceptually bullying despite the apparent similarity in their form and content. In case of bullying, the intent of harm is less ambiguous, an unequal balance of power (both formal and informal) is more salient, and the target of bullying feels threatened, vulnerable and unable to defend himself or herself against negative recurring actions.&lt;ref name="Rayner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peyton" /&gt;

== Personality disorders and dysfunctional personality characteristics==

=== Executives ===
In 2005, psychologists Belinda Board and Katarina Fritzon at the [[University of Surrey]], UK, interviewed and gave personality tests to high-level British executives and compared their profiles with those of criminal psychiatric patients at [[Broadmoor Hospital]] in the UK. They found that three out of eleven [[personality disorders]] were actually more common in executives than in the disturbed criminals. They were:
* [[Histrionic personality disorder]]: including [[superficial charm]], insincerity, [[egocentricity]] and [[psychological manipulation|manipulation]]
* [[Narcissistic personality disorder]]: including [[grandiosity]], self-focused lack of [[empathy]] for others, [[exploitative]]ness and independence.
* [[Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]]: including [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]], excessive devotion to work, rigidity, stubbornness and dictatorial tendencies.

They described these business people as successful [[psychopaths]] and the criminals as unsuccessful psychopaths.&lt;ref&gt;Board, B.J. &amp; Fritzon, Katarina, F. (2005). Disordered personalities at work. ''Psychology, Crime and Law'', 11, 17–32&lt;/ref&gt;

According to leading leadership academic [[Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries]], it seems almost inevitable these days that there will be some personality disorders in a senior management team.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred F. R. Kets de Vries, The Dark Side of Leadership, ''Business Strategy Review'' 14(3), Autumn, page 26 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Industrial/organizational psychology]] research has also examined the types of bullying that exist among business professionals and the prevalence of this form of bullying in the workplace as well as ways to measure bullying empirically.&lt;ref&gt;Salin, D. (2001). Prevalence and forms of bullying among business professionals: A comparison of two different strategies for measuring bullying. European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, 10, 425-441.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychopathy ===
{{Main|Psychopathy in the workplace}}
Narcissism, lack of self-regulation, lack of remorse and lack of conscience have been identified as traits displayed by bullies. These traits are shared with psychopaths, indicating that there is some theoretical
cross-over between bullies and psychopaths.&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;Harvey, M. G., Buckley, M. R., Heames, J. T., Zinko, R., Brouer, R. L. &amp; Ferris, G. R. 2007, ‘A Bully as an Archetypal Destructive Leader’, Journal of Leadership and rganizational Studies, vol. 14, no. 2, pp. 117–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying is used by corporate psychopaths as a tactic to humiliate subordinates.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;Clarke J Working with Monsters: How to Identify and Protect Yourself from the Workplace Psychopath (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying is also used as a tactic to scare, confuse and disorient those who may be a threat to the activities of the corporate psychopath&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt; Using meta data analysis on hundreds of UK research papers, Boddy concluded that 36% of bullying incidents were caused by the presence of corporate psychopaths. According to Boddy there are two types of bullying:&lt;ref name=Boddy&gt;Boddy, C. R. Corporate Psychopaths: Organizational Destroyers (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Predatory bullying – the bully just enjoys bullying and tormenting vulnerable people for the sake of it.
* Instrumental bullying – the bullying is for a purpose, helping the bully achieve their goals.

A corporate psychopath uses instrumental bullying to further their goals of promotion and power as the result of causing confusion and [[divide and rule]].

People with high scores on a psychopathy rating scale are more likely to engage in bullying, crime and drug use than other people.&lt;ref name=Nathanson&gt;Nathanson, C., Williams, K. M. &amp; Paulhus, D. L. 2006, ‘Predictors of a Behavioral Measure of Scholastic Cheating: Personality and Competence but Not Demographics’, [[Contemporary Educational Psychology]], vol. 31, pp. 97–122.&lt;/ref&gt; Hare and Babiak noted that about 29% of corporate psychopaths are also bullies.&lt;ref name=Snakes&gt;Baibak, P; Hare, R. D [[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has also shown that people with high scores on a psychopathy rating scale were more likely to engage in bullying, again indicating that psychopaths tend to be bullies in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Nathanson/&gt;

A workplace bully or abuser will often have issues with social functioning. These types of people often have [[psychopathic]] traits that are difficult to identify in the hiring and promotion process. These individuals often lack [[anger management]] skills and have a distorted sense of reality. Consequently, when confronted with the accusation of abuse, the abuser is not aware that any harm was done.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, P.A. (2009). The role of the consulting psychologist in the prevention, detection, and correction of bullying and mobbing in the workplace. Consulting Psychology Journal, 61(3), 169–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narcissism ===
{{Main|Narcissism in the workplace}}
In 2007, researchers Catherine Mattice and Brian Spitzberg at [[San Diego State University]], USA, found that [[narcissism]] revealed a positive relationship with bullying. Narcissists were found to prefer indirect bullying tactics (such as withholding information that affects others' performance, ignoring others, spreading gossip, constantly reminding others of mistakes, ordering others to do work below their competence level, and excessively monitoring others' work) rather than direct tactics (such as making threats, shouting, persistently criticizing, or making [[false allegations]]). The research also revealed that narcissists are highly motivated to bully, and that to some extent, they are left with feelings of satisfaction after a bullying incident occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Mattice, MA &amp; Brian Spitzberg, PhD [http://noworkplacebullies.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Bully_conference_abstract.160111428.doc Bullies in Business: Self-Reports of Tactics and Motives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425093442/http://noworkplacebullies.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Bully_conference_abstract.160111428.doc |date=25 April 2012 }} San Diego State University, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Machiavellianism ===
{{Main|Machiavellianism in the workplace}}
According to [[Gary Namie|Namie]], Machiavellians manipulate and exploit others to advance their perceived personal agendas but he emphasizes that they are not mentally ill. They do not have a personality disorder, [[schizophrenia]] and neither are they psychopaths. In his view, Machiavellianism represents the core of workplace bullying.&lt;ref&gt;Namie, G. (2006). Why Bullies Bully? A Complete Explanation.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health effects ==
According to Gary and Ruth Namie, as well as Tracy, et al.,&lt;ref name="namiehealth"&gt;Namie, Gary and Ruth [http://www.bullyinginstitute.org/research/res/2003E.html The WBI 2003 Report on Abusive Workplaces] {{webarchive|url=http://www.workplacebullying.org/multi/pdf/N-N-2003C.pdf |date=29 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; workplace bullying can harm the health of the targets of bullying. Organizations are beginning to take note of workplace bullying because of the costs to the organization in terms of the health of their employees.

According to scholars at The Project for Wellness and Work-Life at [[Arizona State University]], "workplace bullying is linked to a host of physical, psychological, organizational, and social costs." [[Workplace stress|Stress]] is the most predominant health effect associated with bullying in the workplace. Research indicates that workplace stress has significant negative effects that are correlated to poor mental health and poor physical health, resulting in an increase in the use of "sick days" or time off from work (Farrell &amp; Geist-Martin, 2005).

The negative effects of bullying are so severe that [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and even suicide&lt;ref name="abcpushed"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-02-08/suicide-waitress-driven-to-the-edge-and-pushed/323884|title=Suicide waitress 'driven to the edge and pushed' |date=9 February 2010 | website=abc.net.au | last=Caldwell | first=Alison | series=The World Today | access-date=14 August 2017 | dead-url=no | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815114447/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-02-08/suicide-waitress-driven-to-the-edge-and-pushed/323884 | archive-date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yildirim, A., &amp; Yildirim, D. (2007). Mobbing in the workplace by peers and managers: mobbing experienced by nurses working in healthcare facilities in Turkey and its effect on nurses. Journal of Clinical Nursing, 16, 1444–1453.&lt;/ref&gt; are not uncommon. Tehrani&lt;ref&gt;Tehrani, N. (2004). Bullying: A source of chronic post traumatic stress? British Journal of Guidance &amp; Counselling, 32, 357–366.&lt;/ref&gt; found that one in 10 targets experience PTSD, and that 44% of her respondents experienced PTSD similar to that of battered women and victims of child abuse. Matthiesen and Einarsen&lt;ref&gt;Matthiesen, S.B., &amp; Einarsen, S. (2004). Psychiatric distress and symptoms of PTSD among victims of bullying at work. British Journal of Guidance &amp; Counselling, 32, 335–356.&lt;/ref&gt; found that up to 77% of targets experience PTSD.

In addition, co-workers who witness workplace bullying can also have negative effects, such as fear, stress, and emotional exhaustion.&lt;ref name="quit" /&gt; Those who witness repetitive workplace abuse often choose to leave the place of employment where the abuse took place. Workplace bullying can also hinder the organizational dynamics such as group cohesion, peer communication, and overall performance.

According to the 2012 survey conducted by Workplace Bullying Institute (516 respondents), Anticipation of next negative event is the most common psychological symptom of workplace bullying reported by 80%. Panic attacks afflict 52%. Half (49%) of targets reported being diagnosed with clinical depression. Sleep disruption, loss of concentration, mood swings, and pervasive sadness and insomnia were more common (ranging from 77% to 50%). Nearly three-quarters (71%) of targets sought treatment from a physician. Over half (63%) saw a mental health professional for their work-related symptoms. Respondents reported other symptoms that can be exacerbated by stress: migraine headaches (48%), irritable bowel disorder (37%), chronic fatigue syndrome (33%) and sexual dysfunction (27%).

== Financial costs to employers ==
Several studies have attempted to quantify the cost of bullying to an organization.
* According to the National Institute of Occupational Safety Health (NIOSH) mental illness among the workforce leads to a loss in employment amounting to $19 billion and a drop in productivity of $3 billion (Sauter, et al., 1990).
* In a report commissioned by the ILO, Hoel, Sparks, &amp; Cooper did a comprehensive analysis of the costs involved in bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/safework/violence/costof.htm |title=The cost of violence and bullying at work |publisher=International Labour Organization (ILO) |accessdate=13 February 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430202909/http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/safework/violence/costof.htm |archivedate=30 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They estimated a cost 1.88 billion pounds plus the cost of lost productivity.
* Based on replacement cost of those who leave as a result of being bullied or witnessing bullying, Rayner and Keashly (2004) estimated that for an organization of 1,000 people, the cost would be $1.2 million US. This estimate did not include the cost of litigation should victims bring suit against the organization.
* A recent Finnish study of more than 5,000 hospital staff found that those who had been bullied had 26% more certified sickness absence than those who were not bullied, when figures were adjusted for base-line measures one year prior to the survey (Kivimäki et al., 2000). According to the researchers these figures are probably an underestimation as many of the targets are likely to have been bullied already at the time the base-line measures were obtained.

Research by Dr. [[Dan Dana]] has shown organizations suffer a large financial cost by not accurately [[conflict management|managing conflict]] and bullying type behaviours. He has developed a tool to assist with calculating the cost of conflict.&lt;ref name="Dana"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mediationworks.com/about-us/mti-team/ |title=Dan Dana |publisher=Mediationworks.com |accessdate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425093442/http://www.mediationworks.com/dmi/biodan.htm |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, researcher Tamara Parris discusses how employers need to be more attentive in managing various discordant behaviours in the workplace, such as, bullying, as it not only creates a financial cost to the organization, but also erodes the company's human resources assets.&lt;ref name="parris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/aboutus/wellnesspublications.shtml|title=Hugh Downs School of Human Communication&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=asu.edu|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610235556/http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/aboutus/wellnesspublications.shtml|archivedate=10 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workplace depression can occur in many companies of various size and profession, and can have negative effects on positive profit growth (McTernan, Dollard &amp; LaMontagne, 2013). Stress factors that are unique to one's working environment, such as bullying from co-workers or superiors and poor social support for high pressure occupations, can build over time and create an inefficient work behavior in a depressed individual (Evan-Lack &amp; Knapp, 2014). In addition, inadequate or negative communication techniques can further drive an employee towards feeling of being disconnected from the company's mission and goals (Hidzir, et al., 2017).  One way that companies can combat the destructive consequences associated with employee depression is to offer more support for counseling and consider bringing in experts to educate staff on the consequences of bullying. Ignoring the problem of depression and decreased workplace performance is creating an unsustainable path towards intergroup conflict and lasting feelings of disillusionment (Fischer, et al., 2014).
