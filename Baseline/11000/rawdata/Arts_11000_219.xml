'''''Above and Below''''' is an [[Installation art|installation]] by [[United States|American]] artist [[Maya Lin]], the designer of the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in Washington, D.C. It is on display at and owned by the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] located in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], [[United States]]. The artwork was inspired by [[underground water]] systems in [[Indiana]].&lt;ref name="ArtBabble1"&gt;{{cite video |people= |date= |title=Maya Lin: Above and Below |url=http://www.artbabble.org/video/ima/maya-lin-above-and-below |medium= |trans_title= |publisher=ArtBabble |location= |accessdate=6 April 2011 |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMACollect"&gt;{{cite web|author=Indianapolis Museum of Art |year=2010 |title=Above and Below |work=Collections |publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art |url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/above-and-below-maya-ying-lin |accessdate=6 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325025753/http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/above-and-below-maya-ying-lin |archivedate=25 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

At {{convert|2,000|sqft|m2}} the sculpture hangs from the ceiling of the Museum's Fortune balcony which is accessible by the [[Indianapolis_Museum_of_Art#The_collections|Asian Art]] gallery.&lt;ref name="ArtBabble1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Indy1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Christopher Lloyd | year=2007 | title=Maya Lin sculpture installed at IMA | work= | publisher=Indy.com | url=http://www.indy.com/posts/maya-lin-sculpture-installed-at-ima | accessdate= 6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of different thicknesses of black painted wire [[aluminum]] tubing strewn together in a flowing-like manner as if to depict a river hanging above the viewers head.&lt;ref name="ArtBabble1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WallaWallaF"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=| title=Above and Below | work=Portfolio | publisher=Walla Walla Foundry | url=http://www.wallawallafoundry.com/portfolio/lin/lin_info4.html | accessdate= 6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Above and Below'' is visible from the 3rd floor galleries and the 4th floor windows.&lt;ref name="Indy1"/&gt;

==Acquisition==

In 1990 the IMA moved their [[Asian art]] galleries to the third floor which featured a balcony overlooking the [[Indianapolis_Museum_of_Art#100_Acres:_Virginia_B._Fairbanks_Art_.26_Nature_Park|100 Acres Virginia B. Fairbanks Art &amp; Nature Park]]. The IMA's Jane Weldon Myers Curator of Asian Art [[Jim Robinson (art historian)|Jim Robinson]] sought to showcase Asian art on the balcony and immediately thought of Lin. The size of the {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on}}. x {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[balcony]] caused curator and artist alike to struggle on what could be created for the space. At first Lin thought about creating an artwork for the [[floor]] of the balcony then she decided to create her installation for the ceiling which would unify the Asian Art and [[contemporary art]] galleries.&lt;ref name="ArtBabble1"/&gt; The sculpture was purchased with funds from William L. and Jane H. Fortune with Maya Lin overseeing the installation.&lt;ref name="IMACollect"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Indy1"/&gt; In 2008 a new stone floor was installed on the balcony, with stones selected by Lin.&lt;ref name="Indy1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nuvo1"&gt;{{cite web | author=David Hoppe | year=2007 | title=Drawing in space | work=News | publisher=Nuvo Newsweekly | url=http://www.nuvo.net/indianapolis/drawing-in-space/Content?oid=1209492 | accessdate= 7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and construction==
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"I don't think people really understand how intricate and beautiful some of these systems are."'' – Maya Lin"&lt;ref name="ArtBabble1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Design===
Maya Lin is known for her major installation works which incorporate [[terrain]] and [[topography]] – inspirations that assisted in the creation of ''Above and Below''. After years of struggling with the balcony space and lack of topographical landscaping in central Indiana, Lin received a suggestion from an assistant from Indiana stating that "there isn't that much above ground, but did you realize there are these incredibly long [[underground river]] systems?" Lin decided to create an underground river system out of [[wire]], despite telling the IMA she was creating a [[landscape]] of [[rubber]].&lt;ref name="ArtBabble1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nuvo1"/&gt; Lin and her team researched the [[Bluespring Caverns]], the [[Lost River (Indiana)|Lost River]], and the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]].&lt;ref name="ArtBabble1"/&gt; Lin visited the Caverns and worked with [[U.S. Geological Survey]] scientists who created an [[ultrasound]] map of the tributaries for the artist.&lt;ref name="Indy1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WallaWallaF"/&gt; The sculpture seeks to "recreate the experience and feeling" of the underwater landscapes through use of various thickness of wire. Three-fifths of the artwork depict the Bluespring Cavern with the last two sections depicting what is beneath the [[water level]] in the cave.&lt;ref name="ArtBabble1"/&gt;

===Construction===
''Above and Below'' was fabricated at [[Walla Walla Foundry]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] utilizing the [[bathymetric]] data gathered from the [[river bottom]] and cavern ceiling. Lin's studio translated the data into a collection of [[contour curves]] and then sent them to the Foundry. The aluminum tubing was carefully bent to match the computer-generated templates created by the studio then hung within the Foundry. The artwork was then disassembled and shipped to the Indianapolis Art Museum and installed in the course of a [[freezing]] cold week on the outside balcony.&lt;ref name="WallaWallaF"/&gt; Lin has created other artwork installations which she describes as "drawing in space" including ''[[Where the Land Meets the Sea]]'' (2008) in the collection of the [[California Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="Nuvo1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Stephen West | year=2008 | title=Maya Lin's Sculpture Floats Like Wiry Cloud, Maps San Francisco | work=News | publisher=Bloomberg | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;refer=muse&amp;sid=avoWXBGwS7mU | accessdate= 6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Art historians at the IMA have described the piece as being easily placed within the [[minimalist]] and [[postminimalist]] tradition due to artists of those movements bringing landscape and nature into the gallery through exploration of environments on a larger scale.&lt;ref name="ArtBabble1"/&gt;

'''''And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street''''' is [[Dr. Seuss|Theodor Seuss Geisel]]'s first [[Children's literature|children's book]]. It was published under the pen name [[Dr. Seuss]]. First published by [[Vanguard Press]] in 1937, the story follows a boy named Marco, who describes a parade of imaginary people and vehicles traveling along a road, Mulberry Street, in an elaborate fantasy story he dreams up to tell his father at the end of his walk. However, when he arrives home he decides instead to tell his father what he actually saw—a simple horse and wagon.

Geisel conceived the core of the book aboard a ship in 1936, returning from a European vacation with his wife. The rhythm of the ship's engines captivated him and inspired the book's signature lines:

{{Poemquote|And that is a story that no one can beat
And to think that I saw it on Mulberry Street.}}

At least 20 publishers rejected the book before Geisel ran into an old college classmate, who had just become juvenile editor at Vanguard Press. Vanguard agreed to publish the book, and it met with high praise from critics upon release, though sales were not as impressive. Later analyses of the book have focused on its connections to Geisel's childhood; the street of the title is probably named after [[Mulberry Street (Springfield, Massachusetts)|a street]] in Geisel's hometown of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. Geisel returned to fictionalized versions of Springfield in later books, and Marco appeared again in 1947 in the Dr. Seuss book ''[[McElligot's Pool]]''.

==Plot==
The story begins as a boy named Marco walks home from school, thinking of his father's advice: "Marco, keep your eyelids up/ And see what you can see." However, the only thing Marco has seen on his walk is a horse pulling a wagon on Mulberry Street. To make his story more interesting, Marco imagines progressively more elaborate scenes based around the horse and wagon. He imagines the horse is first a zebra, then a reindeer, then an elephant, and finally an elephant helped by two giraffes. The wagon changes to a chariot, then a sled, then a cart holding a brass band.

Marco's realization that Mulberry Street intersects with Bliss Street leads him to imagine a group of police escorts. The scene becomes a parade, as he then imagines a grand stand filled with the mayor and [[Alderman|aldermen]]; an airplane dropping confetti; and, in the final incarnation of the scene, a Chinese man, a magician pulling rabbits out of a hat, and a man with a ten-foot beard. Now almost home, he snaps back to reality and rushes up the front steps, eager to tell his father his imagined story. However, when his father questions him about what he saw on his way home, his face turns red and he says, "Nothing...but a plain horse and wagon on Mulberry Street."

==Background==
Geisel was 33 and had ten years of experience in cartooning, illustrating and advertising when he began work on ''Mulberry Street''.&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;Cohen (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;181–187&lt;/ref&gt; He had an established and prosperous career in advertising, including a contract with [[Standard Oil]] for [[FLIT|Flit]] bug spray. Geisel's popular campaign featured the line "Quick, Henry, the Flit!" &lt;ref name=corliss&gt;{{cite news|last=Corliss|first=Richard|title=That Old Feeling: Seuss on First|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,597240,00.html|accessdate=30 October 2013|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=March 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had also made some forays into book publishing: for [[Viking Press]] in 1931 he illustrated ''Boners'' and ''More Boners'', collections of quotations from children's school papers. The book's positive sales encouraged Geisel to create his own children's book,&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;Anderson (2011), p.&amp;nbsp;46&lt;/ref&gt; which his advertising contract did not forbid.&lt;ref name="weidt"&gt;Weidt (1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;27–28&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Geisel wrote and illustrated an [[alphabet book]] featuring a collection of odd animals, but was unable to interest publishers in it.&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="weidt"/&gt;
&lt;!-- [[File:MS Kungsholm 1928.jpg|thumb|alt=A black-and-white photograph of a luxury ocean liner.|Geisel conceived of the story aboard the luxury liner [[MS Kungsholm (1928)|MS ''Kungsholm'']] in 1936.]] --&gt;&lt;!-- Missing source for the image --&gt;

According to Judith and Neil Morgan, Geisel conceived the core of ''Mulberry Street'' in the summer of 1936 aboard the [[MS Kungsholm (1928)|MS ''Kungsholm'']], a [[Swedish American Line|Swedish American]] luxury liner, during the return trip from a European vacation with his wife, [[Helen Palmer (author)|Helen Palmer]]. As the ''Kungsholm'' endured a storm and Geisel suffered from sea sickness, he jotted down a rambling plot that started with "a stupid horse and wagon".&lt;ref name="Morgan-creation"/&gt; To keep himself occupied, he began reciting poetry to the rhythm of the ship's engines and soon found himself saying, "And that is a story that no one can beat, and to think that I saw it on Mulberry Street." For days after they landed, he had the rhythm of the ship's engine stuck in his head, so, at Helen's suggestion, he decided to write a story based around it.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan &amp; Morgan (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;79–81&lt;/ref&gt;

The Morgans-based this account on interviews with Geisel, who had given similar accounts of the book's creation to journalists throughout his career, often omitting or altering various details. In one version, he had already been working on the book for six months before the European trip, and the trip home provided the final breakthrough. In another, he claimed he had the book about half finished when they landed in the US.&lt;ref name="Nel119"&gt;Nel (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;119–121&lt;/ref&gt;

Geisel, in his perfectionism, struggled with writing ''Mulberry Street''. According to the Morgans, "Although he lived for wit, his flights of fancy were subject to strict review."&lt;ref name="Morgan-creation"&gt;Morgan &amp; Morgan (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;81&lt;/ref&gt; He spent at least six months on the book, questioning every word and writing numerous drafts. He wrote the poem out in pencil on yellow paper and asked his wife to discuss every page with him.&lt;ref name="Morgan-creation"/&gt;

==Publication history==
Geisel submitted his finished manuscript, originally titled ''A Story No One Can Beat'', to dozens of publishers during the winter of 1936–37.&lt;ref name="Morgan-creation"/&gt;{{efn|Geisel claimed, in varying accounts, that the manuscript was rejected by 20, 26, 27, 28, and 29 publishers.&lt;ref name="Nel1"/&gt; [[Alison Lurie]] later reported that 43 publishers had rejected the book.&lt;ref name="Lurie-69"&gt;Lurie (1992), p.&amp;nbsp;69&lt;/ref&gt;}} Publishers posited a variety of criticisms of the book, including that fantasy was not salable, that children's books written in verse were out of style, and that the book lacked a clear moral message. According to the Morgans, Geisel angrily exclaimed to his wife, "What's wrong with kids having fun reading without being preached at?"&lt;ref name="Morgan-creation"/&gt; She cited the book's cartoon-like drawings and its story, which might be seen to encourage daydreaming and lying to one's parents, as possible reasons for its rejection.&lt;ref name="Lurie-69" /&gt;

According to Geisel, he was walking down [[Madison Avenue]] in New York City after learning of the latest rejection, planning to burn the manuscript when he got home, when he ran into Mike McClintock, an old [[Dartmouth College]] classmate.&lt;ref name="morgan-mcclintock"&gt;Morgan &amp; Morgan (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;82&lt;/ref&gt; McClintock had just become juvenile editor at [[Vanguard Press]] and took Geisel to his office to introduce him to Vanguard's President James Henle and editor Evelyn Shrifte. Henle had been gaining a reputation for signing authors whom other, larger publishers had rejected. He soon agreed to publish the book, with only the condition that its title be changed. Geisel cited the incident for his belief in luck and later stated, "If I had been walking down the other side of Madison Avenue, I'd be in the dry-cleaning business today."&lt;ref name="morgan-mcclintock" /&gt; In gratitude to McClintock, Geisel changed the name of the book's protagonist to Marco, after McClintock's son, and dedicated the book to McClintock's wife, Helene.&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt;

In "an act of faith",&lt;ref name="morgan-publishing"&gt;Morgan &amp; Morgan (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;83&lt;/ref&gt; Vanguard Press printed 15,000 copies of the book for its first printing. To promote the book, Henle bought a full-page advertisement in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', which reproduced the book's two-page spread of a reindeer pulling a cart and featured the line, "Book publishers, hitch on! This is the start of a parade that will take you places!" &lt;ref name="morgan-publishing"/&gt; Approximately two years later, Vanguard printed 6,000 more copies. By 1943, it had printed 31,600 copies, and Geisel's royalties were no more than $3,500.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan &amp; Morgan (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;85&lt;/ref&gt; Although Geisel later moved to [[Random House]], Vanguard continued to publish ''Mulberry Street'' and his second book, ''[[The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins]]'', until 1988, when Random House bought Vanguard.&lt;ref name="Morgan 1995 275"&gt;Morgan &amp; Morgan (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;275&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has received only one textual revision. In 1978, Geisel agreed to a slight rewording, renaming the character who appears near the end of the story a "Chinese man" instead of a "[[Chinaman (term)|Chinaman]]".&lt;ref name="Nel2"&gt;Nel (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;108–109&lt;/ref&gt; He also agreed to remove the character's pigtail and the yellow coloring from the character's skin.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan &amp; Morgan (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;276&lt;/ref&gt; However, he denied on multiple occasions requests from feminists to change the lines "Say&amp;mdash;''any''one could think of ''that'',/ Jack or Fred or Joe or Nat&amp;mdash;/ Say, even Jane could think of ''that''."&lt;ref name="Nel2"/&gt;

==Reception==
Hearing of its release, neighbors of Geisel's in Springfield were at first worried the book would be an exposé of the people there.  Sales were lackluster, but early reviews were glowing.&lt;ref name="Krull"&gt;{{cite book|last=Krull|first=Kathleen|authorlink=Kathleen Krull|title=The Boy on Fairfield Street|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kh5HT8TXcV8C|year=2011|publisher=Random House Children's Books|isbn=978-0-307-55484-0}} (unpaginated)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Clifton Fadiman]] wrote a one-sentence review in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', which Geisel could still quote near the end of his life: "They say it's for children, but better get a copy for yourself and marvel at the good Dr. Seuss' impossible pictures and the moral tale of the little boy who exaggerated not wisely but too well."&lt;ref name="morgan-reviews"&gt;Morgan &amp; Morgan (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;83–84&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "Highly original and entertaining, Dr Seuss' picture book partakes of the better qualities of those peculiarly America institutions, the funny papers and the tall tale. It is a masterly interpretation of the mind of a child in the act of creating one of those stories with which children often amuse themselves and bolster up their self-respect."&lt;ref name="morgan-reviews"/&gt;

[[File:Beatrix Potter by King cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Black-and-white photo of a woman in a dress standing.|Children's book writer [[Beatrix Potter]] was among those who were enthusiastic about Seuss's first book.]]

[[Anne Carroll Moore]], then in charge of the children's section at the [[New York Public Library]], wrote an enthusiastic review in the ''[[The Atlantic|Atlantic Monthly]]'' and invited Geisel to speak at the library. In her review she called the book "so completely spontaneous that the American child can take it to his heart on sight", and "as original in conception, as spontaneous in the rendering as it is true to the imagination of a small boy."&lt;ref name="morgan-reviews"/&gt; Moore sent a copy of the book to English children's author [[Beatrix Potter]], who wrote back, "What an amusing picture book&amp;nbsp;... I think it the cleverest book I have met with for many years. The swing and merriment of the pictures and the natural truthful simplicity of the untruthfulness&amp;nbsp;... Too many story books for children are condescending, self-conscious inventions—and then some trivial oversight, some small incorrect detail gives the whole show away.

It was written from the point of view of my mind, not the mind of a child."&lt;ref name="Nichols"&gt;Nichols (1962), p.&amp;nbsp;42&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''Mulberry Street''{{'}}s sales grew significantly as the Dr. Seuss brand became more famous,&lt;ref name="Morgan 1995 275"/&gt; it is not one of Geisel's best-selling books.&lt;ref name=winerip&gt;{{cite news|last=Winerip|first=Michael|title=Mulberry Street May Fade, but 'Mulberry Street' Shines On|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/30/education/dr-seuss-book-mulberry-street-turns-75.html|accessdate=October 30, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, on the occasion of the book's 75th anniversary, Michael Winerip argued that later Dr. Seuss books were more entertaining and inventive than ''Mulberry Street'' but that it is nevertheless important as a harbinger of the many books that followed.&lt;ref name=winerip/&gt; [[A.&amp;nbsp;O. Scott]], in a 2000 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', contradicted this view, calling the book  "a hymn to the generative power of fantasy, a celebration of the sheer inventive pleasure of spinning an ordinary event into 'a story that no one can beat'."&lt;ref name=scott&gt;{{cite news|last=Scott|first=A.&amp;nbsp;O.|title=Sense and Nonsense|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/26/magazine/sense-and-nonsense.html|accessdate=November 2, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 26, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==

=== Autobiographical elements and influences ===
[[File:Mulberry Street, Springfield MA.jpg|thumb|alt=A color photo. Down the middle runs a tree-lined sidewalk, with a fenced grassy area to the left and a street to the left, lined with houses.|Geisel was likely thinking of the real-life [[Mulberry Street (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Mulberry Street]] of the [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] of his youth.]]

Some writers have focused on ''Mulberry Street''{{'}}s connections to elements of Geisel's life, particularly his childhood in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. Geisel probably named the street in his story after a real-life [[Mulberry Street (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Mulberry Street]] in Springfield.&lt;ref name="winerip" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/01/24/145471724/how-dr-seuss-got-his-start-on-mulberry-street|title=How Dr. Seuss Got His Start 'On Mulberry Street'|date=January 24, 2012|newspaper=[[NPR]]|author=NPR staff|accessdate=October 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Guy McLain, director of the Springfield Museum, contends that Geisel might have chosen the street mainly because of the sound and rhythm of its name.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; Lewis Nichols, writing in 1962 on the occasion of the book's 25th anniversary, largely confirmed this view, writing that in the book's creation "there was no particular Mulberry Street in view, although there was one of the name in Springfield, Mass., where Mr. Geisel was born, and the subconscious may have taken him back."&lt;ref name="Nichols" /&gt; Other writers have pointed out that the motorcycles the policemen use to escort the parade in ''Mulberry Street'' resemble [[Indian (motorcycle)|Indian]] motorcycles, which were manufactured in Springfield during Geisel's childhood.&lt;ref name="winerip" /&gt;&lt;ref name="urban"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/07/dr_seuss_and_to_think_that_i_s.html|title=Dr. Seuss' 'And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street' to turn 75 years old|last=Urban|first=Cori|date=July 7, 2012|newspaper=The Republican|accessdate=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cori Urban claimed that the mayor in the story resembles [[Fordis C. Parker]], who was mayor of Springfield from 1925 to 1929.&lt;ref name="urban" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;City of Springfield (1922), ''Municipal Register of the City of Springfield'', Springfield, Ma.: City of Springfield, p.&amp;nbsp;908&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Cohen notes that, while the book mentions the intersection of Bliss and Mulberry Streets, their real-life counterparts in Springfield do not cross.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt; Cohen connects the horse and wagon in ''Mulberry Street'' to Geisel's Springfield childhood and points to precursors of it in Geisel's earlier work. He traces the blue elephant in the book to the blue elephants that appear in Geisel's comic strip ''[[Hejji]]''. Philip Nel acknowledges ''Mulberry Street'' as the start of Geisel's particular, distinctive verse style and theorizes that he may have learned "the narrative power of meter and rhyme" from books he read as a child, including ''The Hole Book'' by [[Peter Newell]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Nel (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;16–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Cott noted that ''Mulberry Street'' is similar to "[[Der Erlkönig]]", a German poem by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], "for both of them are about a father and a son and about the exigencies and power of the imagination."&lt;ref name="Cott 110"&gt;Cott (1983), p.&amp;nbsp;110&lt;/ref&gt; When Cott told Geisel about this, Geisel responded by quoting the first two lines of the poem, in German. He also noted that he was raised in a German-speaking home, minored in German in college, and had memorized the poem while in high school.&lt;ref name="Cott 110"/&gt;

Mary Galbraith makes a connection between ''Mulberry Street'' and Geisel's fears about the spread of [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name="Nel1" /&gt; Geisel conceived of the story while returning from a European vacation that coincided with the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin, and Galbraith contends that in the book the "mayor's small mustache and raised arm evoke Hitler, while the brass band and international cast of characters evoke the parade of nations at the beginning of the games".&lt;ref name="Nel1"&gt;Nel (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;47&lt;/ref&gt;  She argues that the horse and wagon at the beginning of the story evokes the peaceful German Americans of Springfield, and by extension the non-threatening actions of Germany. As Marco's story evolves, the horse and wagon transform into a parade, which Galbraith equates with "a military monolith&amp;nbsp;... marching down main street as an airplane drops confetti."&lt;ref name="Nel1" /&gt;

=== Marco's relationship with his father ===
Some analyses have examined the relationship between Marco and his father. Alison Lurie asserts that Marco's factual reply to his father at the end of the story suggests to the book's young readers that "it is sometimes, perhaps always, best to conceal one's inner imaginative life from adults",&lt;ref name="Lurie 1992 70"&gt;Lurie (1992), p.&amp;nbsp;70&lt;/ref&gt; a message that appears again in ''[[The Cat in the Hat]]''.&lt;ref name="Lurie 1992 70" /&gt;  To Matthew Pierlot, "The father serves as an external check on the boy's tendency to abandon the truth",&lt;ref&gt;Pierlot (2011), p.&amp;nbsp;48&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Socrates]]-like figure who insists on intellectual integrity and thwarts Marco's desire to mold mundane reality into something more exciting than it is.&lt;ref&gt;Pierlot (2011), pp.&amp;nbsp;47–48&lt;/ref&gt;  To Patrick Shannon, "Marco escapes into his imagination to combat the insipid character and conformity of the adult world".&lt;ref name="Shannon"&gt;Shannon (1986), p.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;  In this sense the book follows an individualist, child-centered trend in children's literature beginning in the mid-20th century, also seen in the works of [[Maurice Sendak]] and [[William Steig]]; this is in contrast to the norm in earlier children's books where the author tried to impart outside values on the child reader.&lt;ref name="Shannon" /&gt;

Pastoral theologian Herbert Anderson has written that the child's perspective of reality in ''Mulberry Street'' can be challenging and seem subversive to an adult. He argues that Marco's internal story of what happened on his walk was not dishonest or rebellious, but a natural "openness to constructing a world".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (2011), p.&amp;nbsp;40&lt;/ref&gt;  The child's untruthful response that he had not seen anything interesting on Mulberry Street is not out of disrespect to the parent, but is Marco's attempt to reconcile his perspective with the authoritative, adult one of his father.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (2011), pp.&amp;nbsp;39–41&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Verse style ===
Nel notes that Geisel makes heavy use of [[anapestic tetrameter]] in ''Mulberry Street'' and many of his later books, citing the rhythm and draw of the books' language as a main reason for their appeal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thomas Fensch also notes the rollicking rhythm of the verse in ''Mulberry Street'' and Geisel's other books, writing, "Children can read the lines; they can sing the lines; they can ''SHOUT!'' the lines; they can dance to the lines."&lt;ref name="Fensch 68"&gt;Fensch (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;68&lt;/ref&gt; Fensch marks ''Mulberry Street'' as the start of what he calls "''escalating sequences'' or ''escalating action''", a technique Geisel used in most of his books, in which the action builds with each page. As Fensch put it, "The rhythm gallops&amp;mdash;the pictures move from left to right, toward the next page and the action builds."&lt;ref name="Fensch 68" /&gt;

===Artwork===

Geisel's drawings formed a part of the narrative, bordering on the blending of text and image found in the much-denigrated comics medium. The artwork in children's literature before Geisel's appearance was much more restrained than Geisel's, and relegated to a lower status than the text it illustrated.&lt;ref name="Morgan-art"&gt;Morgan &amp; Morgan (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;84&lt;/ref&gt; By linking text and image, the book helps children follow the story even if they cannot read every word of the text.&lt;ref name="Nel66"&gt;Nel (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;66&lt;/ref&gt; By encouraging children to explore the page, the drawings allow them to use their imaginations to fill in gaps in the text.&lt;ref name="Tunstall222"/&gt; The details shown in the pictures but not explained in the text creates a tension between them that leads the reader to think and imagine further. In the case of ''Mulberry Street'', Philip Nel writes, readers might be moved to ask questions such as "Why is the elephant blue?" or "Where did the airplane come from?"&lt;ref name="Nel66"/&gt;

In bold colors Geisel illustrated the surreal scenery&lt;ref name="Tunstall222"/&gt; and strange human and animal characters&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;{{cite book|last=MacDonald|first=Ruth|title=Dr. Seuss|year=1988|publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Twayne Publishers]]|isbn=0-8057-7524-2|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the book with the strong, loose, energetic line&lt;ref name="Tunstall222"&gt;Tunstall (2011), p.&amp;nbsp;222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nel3"/&gt; that remained familiar in his later works.&lt;ref name=macdonald/&gt; Ruth MacDonald saw Geisel's drawing style as fully formed in ''Mulberry Street'', arguing that only his page design improved in later books, better keeping children's attention without confusing them.&lt;ref name=macdonald/&gt; Philip Nel found the artwork in Geisel's later books to have a greater energy and looseness than in ''Mulberry Street'' or his earlier cartooning. Nel felt Geisel began loosening up toward his classic style as early as ''[[Horton Hatches the Egg]]'' (1940) and reached fruition with 1950's ''[[If I Ran the Zoo]]'' (1950).&lt;ref name="Nel3"&gt;Nel (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;71–72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

[[File:Deems Taylor portrait by Carl Van Vechten.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A black-and-white photograph of the upper portion of a man in glasses, looking leftward.|[[Deems Taylor]] ''(pictured)'' adapted ''Mulberry Street'' into an orchestral work, ''Marco Takes a Walk'' (1942).]]

Composer [[Deems Taylor]] adapted ''Mulberry Street'' into an orchestral work, ''Marco Takes a Walk''. The work opens with a theme that represents the horse and wagon, which is followed by six variations that represent the various changes in Marco's story. The work's premiere, conducted by [[Howard Barlow]], occurred at [[Carnegie Hall]] on November 14, 1942.&lt;ref name=pegolotti&gt;{{cite book|last=Pegolotti|first=James|title=Deems Taylor: A Biography|year=2003|publisher=North Eastern University Press|isbn=1-55553-587-9|pages=283–284|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n5G_Lqh3h4UC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;lpg=PA283}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1961 the book was given the [[Lewis Carroll Shelf Award]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas &amp; Miller (2011), p.&amp;nbsp;82&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|film}} A short film based on the book was released by [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1944.&lt;ref name="puppetoon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/36555-And_To_Think_I_Saw_It_On_Mulberry_S.html |title=And To Think I Saw It On Mulberry Street |publisher=[[Big Cartoon DataBase]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made by [[George Pal]] as part of his [[Puppetoons]] series, which featured an adaptation of Geisel's ''[[The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins]]'' the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/36548-500-Hats-Of-Bartholemew-Cubbins| title=The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins|publisher=[[Big Cartoon DataBase]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mulberry Street'' adaptation was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoon)]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="puppetoon"/&gt;

==Legacy==
As ''Mulberry Street'' is Geisel's first children's book, Donald Pease calls it "the scene of origin for all of Dr. Seuss's children's books".&lt;ref&gt;Pease (2010), p.&amp;nbsp;85&lt;/ref&gt; After several books in prose, Geisel returned to verse for 1940's ''Horton Hatches the Egg'', using the same "galloping, rollicking, anapestic tetrameter rhyme scheme"&lt;ref name="Fensch1"&gt;Fensch (2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;82–83&lt;/ref&gt; he had used for ''Mulberry Street''. In a later series of children's stories for ''[[Redbook]]'' magazine, Geisel reported "the latest news from Mulberry Street". In "Marco Comes Late", Marco attempts to explain why he is two hours late to school.&lt;ref name="Fensch1"/&gt;

Geisel returned to fictionalized versions of his home town in three later books, which, together with ''Mulberry Street'', form what Donald Pease calls the Springfield Cycle.&lt;ref name=Pease&gt;Pease (2010), pp.&amp;nbsp;84–86&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[McElligot's Pool]]'' (1947), ''If I Ran the Zoo'' (1950), and ''[[If I Ran the Circus]]'' (1956) take place in different fictionalized versions of Springfield. Each also features a young protagonist who, when prompted by an adult, responds with "a series of increasingly fantastic scenarios."&lt;ref name=Pease/&gt; ''McElligot's Pool'' also marks Marco's return as a main character in a Dr. Seuss book.&lt;ref name=Pease/&gt;

When Geisel returned to Springfield in 1986 as part of a publicity tour he was greeted by dozens of children on Mulberry Street.&lt;ref name=rother&gt;{{cite news|last=Rother|first=Larry|title=After 60 Years, Dr. Seuss Goes Back to his Roots|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/21/us/after-60-years-dr-seuss-goes-back-to-his-roots.html|accessdate=October 31, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 21, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another group of children held up a banner that read, "And to think that we saw him on Mulberry Street".&lt;ref name=rother/&gt; [[John Fogerty]], frontman for the [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], has stated that the band's song "[[Lookin' Out My Back Door]]" was partly inspired by the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordowitz|first=Hank|title=Bad Moon Rising: The Unauthorized History of Creedence Clearwater Revival|year=1998|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]|page=98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDDKxvnPy7cC&amp;pg=PA98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This happens when they seek external technologies for their business or external markets for their own technologies. It has implications for the value of technology and innovations as well as their development by more than one firm and for the need for and limitations of patent protection.

Arrow's information paradox theory was set out in a 1962 paper.&lt;ref&gt;Arrow, Kenneth J. ''Economic Welfare and the Allocation of Resources for Invention, in The Rate and Direction of Inventive Activity'', 609 (Nat’l Bureau of Econ. Research ed. 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; Cornell Law School professor Oskar Liivak has written in a paper for a conference at Stanford University that Arrow's "paper has been one of the foundational theoretical pillars of the incentive based theory of patents as Arrow’s work is thought to rule out a strictly market-based solution."&lt;ref name="Liivak"&gt;Liivak, Oskar. [http://web.stanford.edu/dept/law/ipsc/Paper%20PDF/Liivak,%20Oskar%20-%20Paper.pdf ''The (Relatively) Easy Case for Patents on Inventions'']. (2012). Retrieved August 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental tenet of the paradox is that the [[customer]], i.e. the potential purchaser of the information describing a technology (or other information having some value, such as facts), wants to know the technology and what it does in sufficient detail as to understand its capabilities or have information about the facts or products to decide whether or not to buy it.&lt;ref&gt;Leppälä, Samuli, Cardiff University, [http://business.cardiff.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Arrowsparadox.pdf ''Arrow's Paradox and Unprotected Markets for Information''].

Sloan Foundation’s Ralph Gomory Article Prize 2013. Retrieved August 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the customer has this detailed knowledge, however, the seller has in effect transferred the technology to the customer without any [[Royalties|compensation]].&lt;ref name="Takenaka"/&gt; This has been argued to show the need for patent protection.&lt;ref name="Liivak"/&gt;

If the buyer trusts the seller, or is protected via contract, then they only need to know the results that the technology will provide, along with any caveats for its usage in a given context.&lt;ref&gt;Burstein, Michael J. [http://www.texaslrev.com/wp-content/uploads/Burstein.pdf ''Exchanging Information without Intellectual Property''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202155425/http://www.texaslrev.com/wp-content/uploads/Burstein.pdf |date=February 2, 2013 }}.

Retrieved August 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A problem is that sellers lie, they may be mistaken, one or both sides overlook side consequences for usage in a given context, or some [[unknown unknown]] affects the actual outcome.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3816">'''Baharestan''', (in Persian: بهارستان), (pronounced as ''Bǎhārestān'' or ''Bahaarestaan'') (meaning ''the land of spring'', ''the spring orchard'' or ''the spring garden''), is a [[Persian language|Persian]] book written by [[Jami]] that contains [[prose]]. It has stories, [[Narrative|tales]] and moral advice mainly in prose, but also in [[poetry]]. Baharestan is divided into eight [[chapter (books)|chapter]]s, an introduction, and a final part. Each of its chapters is called a ''rowzeh'' (from [[Arabic]] rawzah, meaning ''paradise'' or ''heaven''). Jami wrote this book in a year in the 9th century after [[Hegira|Muhammad's departure]] to Medina. In the introduction of Baharestan, Jami stated that he had written this book in the style of [[Saadi Shirazi]]'s [[Gulistan (book)|Gulistan]] for his son who was ten years old at the time and was studying. Baharestan has content about [[Sufism]] and [[mysticism]]. There are 469 [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] of poetry in this book; 16 verses being in Arabic and the rest in Persian. Baharestan has [[saj']] in its texts and the type of its prose is [[rhymed prose]]; i.e. it is rhythmic. Each chapter in Baharestan has a specific topic; for example, in the seventh chapter, the topic is the life and the biography of some poets.

'''Bolli Bollason''' (also '''Bolli Bollison''') was a key historical character in the [[Old Norse|Medieval Icelandic]] ''[[Laxdæla saga]]'', born around 1000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islendingabok.is/Main.jsp?id=DpMpHmGgJkKkFoKk&amp;number=11896087 The Icelandic database genealogy information of Bolli Bollason]{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in Orlygsstadir, at [[Helgafell]] on the [[Snæfellsnes|Snæfellsnes Peninsula]] in Iceland.  He divided his time between Helgafell and Tunga, the home of [[Snorri Goði|Snorri the Goði]].&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|[Note 1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;  He was held in the highest regard among the contemporary [[Scandinavia]]n rulers, and also in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|[Note 2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; It is believed that he had reached the rank of ''[[manglabites]]'' in the [[Byzantine army|Eastern Roman army]],&lt;ref name="Heath"&gt;Heath, p 38&lt;/ref&gt; and on his return to Iceland, his finery and recognition earned him the name "Bolli the Elegant".&lt;ref name="Thorsson419"&gt;Thorsson, p 419&lt;/ref&gt;

His importance in the literary context of the [[Icelanders' sagas|saga]] is his prominence as the son of [[Bolli Þorleiksson]] and [[Guðrún Ósvífursdóttir]], the two central characters of the work. He is mentioned at the end of the ''[[The Tale of Sarcastic Halli|Sneglu-Hall þáttur]]'' (''The Tale of Sarcastic Halli''), and is also the subject of his own [[Þáttr|tale]], the ''Bollaþáttur'', which was later appended to the end of the manuscripts in the early 14th century.

==Laxdæla saga==

===Background===
{{Main|Laxdæla saga}}
[[File:Möðruvallabók f13r.jpg|thumb|A page of ''[[Njál's saga]]'' from the ''[[Möðruvallabók]]'', the same vellum manuscript containing the ''[[Laxdæla saga]]'' and the ''Bollaþáttur'']]
The ''Laxdæla saga'' or ''Saga of the People of Laxardal'' is an Icelandic [[family saga]] written sometime between 1250 and 1270, possibly by a woman author.&lt;ref name="Thorsson270"&gt;Thorsson, p 270&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thorsson274-275"&gt;Thorsson, p 274-275&lt;/ref&gt;  "Vast in conception", the grand sweep of the saga's action spans well over a century from AD 890 to 1030.&lt;ref name="Thorsson270"/&gt;  Alongside ''[[Njál's saga]]'' and ''[[Egil's saga]]'', the Laxdæla saga makes the strongest claim of any Icelandic saga for literary greatness.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsson, p xii&lt;/ref&gt;  Shaped by continental literary traditions and several types of saga,&lt;ref name="Thorsson270"/&gt; the characterisation "highlights nobility, splendour and physical appearance", although:

{{blockquote|…in their actions the male characters tend not to live up to the grandeur and hyperbole with which they are presented.  At foreign courts their stature is aristocratic, but at home in Iceland they are farmers with few outlets other than words and smart clothes for their aspirations to nobility.  This is a saga in which even slaves are high-born, descended from the kings of Ireland.&lt;ref name="Thorsson274"&gt;Thorsson, p 274&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The saga is also a feud saga, in which "feuds escalate from trivial local squabbles into unstoppable vendettas.  The male protagonists are splendid figures who die heroic deaths, while the women are strong characters who engineer much of the action".&lt;ref name="Thorsson-lxi"&gt;Thorsson, p lxi&lt;/ref&gt;

Many manuscripts of the ''Laxdæla saga'' have survived, although all printed versions have been based upon the ''[[Möðruvallabók]]'' (dated 1330-1370), the only intact vellum manuscript.&lt;ref name="Thorsson275"&gt;Thorsson, p 275&lt;/ref&gt;  Historiographically, the distinction between narrative and history did not exist at the time when the sagas were written.&lt;ref name="Thorsson-xxx"&gt;Thorsson, p xxx&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the sagas develop a "dense and plausible" historical context,&lt;ref name="Thorsson-xxxv"&gt;Thorsson, p xxxv&lt;/ref&gt; with the authenticating details&lt;ref name="Thorsson-xxvii"&gt;Thorsson, p xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; and precision necessary for the narrative.&lt;ref name="Thorsson-xxxvii"&gt;Thorsson, p xxxvii&lt;/ref&gt;  The world within which the local and detailed stories of the individual sagas exist can be confirmed by archaeology and comparison with histories in other languages.&lt;ref name="Thorsson-xxxi"&gt;Thorsson, p xxxi&lt;/ref&gt;

===Account===

====Family and early life====
[[Image:Map of the Snæfellsnes peninsula.png|thumb|left|Snæfellsnes, where Bolli was born.]]

Bolli Bollason was one of the [[Norse clans|People of Laxárdalur]], in the Western Quarter of Iceland.  He was born in 1006 to [[Guðrún Ósvífursdóttir]], the winter after the killing of his father, [[Bolli Þorleiksson]].  Guðrún had been courted by Bolli Þorleiksson and his foster-brother Kjartan Ólafsson, but although she preferred Kjartan, she gave herself to Bolli Þorleiksson on the basis of a false rumour that Kjartan was engaged.  The consequent hostilities between the two foster-brothers ended with Bolli Þorleiksson killing Kjartan, and then he in turn being killed by Kjartan's kinsmen.  Bolli Bollason grew up with his brother Thorleik, who was four years his senior, and his mother Guðrún in Helgafell, after she exchanged homes with the renowned [[Snorri the Goði]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcllibrary.org/Laxdaela/chapter56.html|title=Chapter LXI|last=|first=|date=|work=Laxdaela Saga|publisher=The Medieval and Classical Literature Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guðrún remarried, this time to Thorkell Eyjolffsson, who became a great chieftain in his own countryside and took over the running of the household at Helgafell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcllibrary.org/Laxdaela/chapter69.html|title=Chapter LXIX|last=|first=|date=|work=Laxdaela Saga|publisher=The Medieval and Classical Literature Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="LXX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcllibrary.org/Laxdaela/chapter70.html|title=Chapter LXX|last=|first=|date=|work=Laxdaela Saga|publisher=The Medieval and Classical Literature Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This left Bolli able to spend his time both at Helgafell and with Snorri in Tunga, and Snorri became very fond of him.&lt;ref name="LXX"/&gt; Thorkell was fond of both his stepsons, but Bolli was regarded as "being the foremost in all things".&lt;ref name="LXX"/&gt; Thorleik journeyed abroad to Norway, and stayed with King [[Olaf II of Norway|Olaf II]] for several months.

When Bolli was eighteen years old he asked for his father's portion, as he intended to woo Thordis Snorradottir, the daughter of [[Snorri Goði]]. He set out with his stepfather and a good many followers to Tunga. Snorri welcomed them, and the wedding feast took place that summer. Bolli abode at Tunga, and love grew between him and Thordis. The next summer, Thorleik returned in a goods-laden ship to White-river, "and the brothers greeted each other joyfully".&lt;ref name="LXX"/&gt;

The two brothers made peace with the sons of Ólaf, Kjartan's kinsmen, at the [[Thing (assembly)|Thorness Thing]]; it is not known how much money was exchanged in [[Weregild|compensation]] as part of the agreement, but Bolli received a good sword, and after the assembly "both sides were thought to have gained in esteem from these affairs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcllibrary.org/Laxdaela/chapter71.html|title=Chapter LXXI|last=|first=|date=|work=Laxdaela Saga|publisher=The Medieval and Classical Literature Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Travels abroad====
[[Image:Bremen Hansekogge RolandvonBremen.JPG|thumb|A trade-[[cog (ship)|cog]] of the type that Bolli might have taken to Denmark.&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|[Note 3]]]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Bolli's later travels abroad with his brother Thorleik are well documented and notable for his role in the Varangian Guard. They departed Iceland, taking "a great deal of money abroad with him", and reached Norway in the autumn. They stayed in Thrandheim for the winter, while King [[Olaf II of Norway|Olaf II]] was wintering in the east in [[Sarpsborg]]. Bolli soon became highly thought of in Norway, and his arrivals at the guild meeting-places were noted for being better arrayed as to raiment and weapons than other townsfolk. Early in the spring the brothers prepared their ship and went east to meet the king. The king thought Bolli "a man of high mettle," "even peerless among men", and "the man of greatest mark that has ever come from Iceland."&lt;ref name="L73"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcllibrary.org/Laxdaela/chapter73.html|title=Chapter LXXIII|last=|first=|date=|work=Laxdaela Saga|publisher=The Medieval and Classical Literature Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolli boarded a [[cog (ship)|trade-ship]] bound for Denmark, departing King Olaf in great friendship and with fine parting gifts.&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|[Note 2]]]&lt;/sup&gt;  Thorleik remained behind, but Bolli wintered in Denmark and became as well regarded as he had been in Norway.&lt;ref name="L73"/&gt; Travelling next to [[Constantinople]], he spent many years in the Varangian Guard; "and was thought to be the most valiant in all deeds that try a man, and always went next to those in the forefront."&lt;ref name="L73"/&gt; The saga also records the finery his followers received from the [[Byzantine Emperor|Roman Emperor]] (most likely [[Romanos III]]), and the influence he held after his return to Iceland, some time after the death of King Olaf II:&lt;ref name="penguin"&gt;Thorsson&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Bolli rode from the ship with twelve men, and all his followers were dressed in scarlet, and rode on gilt saddles, and all were they a trusty band, though Bolli was peerless among them. He had on the clothes of fur which the Garth-king had given him, he had over all a scarlet cape; and he had Footbiter girt on him, the hilt of which was dight with gold, and the grip woven with gold, he had a gilded helmet on his head, and a red shield on his flank, with a knight painted on it in gold. He had a dagger in his hand, as is the custom in foreign lands; and whenever they took quarters the women paid heed to nothing but gazing at Bolli and his grandeur, and that of his followers.|&lt;ref name="LaxardalQuote"&gt;{{cite web |title=Chapter LXXVII |url=http://mcllibrary.org/Laxdaela/chapter77.html |work=Laxdaela Saga |publisher=The Medieval and Classical Literature Library |accessdate=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The right to bear a gold-hilted sword was one of the privileges of the court rank of [[manglabites]], and is taken as an indicator that Bolli held this rank.&lt;ref name="Heath"/&gt; In Iceland, his finery and recognition earned him the name "Bolli the Elegant".&lt;ref name="Thorsson419"/&gt; His return to Thordis was joyful, and he took over the manor of Tunga when Snorri died at 67 years of age.&lt;ref name="L78"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcllibrary.org/Laxdaela/chapter78.html|title=Chapter LXXVIII|last=|first=|date=|work=Laxdaela Saga|publisher=The Medieval and Classical Literature Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolli had two children with Thordis: Herdis Bolladottir and Ospak Bollason.&lt;ref name="L78"/&gt;

==Tales==

===Bollaþáttur===
[[File:Law speaker.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Althing]] at [[Þingvellir]], which Bolli attended the same year he killed Thorolf Stuck-up]]
In Norse literature, a tale or ''þáttur'' referred to a short narrative often included as an episode in a larger whole, such as part of a saga.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsson, p 757&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Bolla þáttur Bollasonar'', or ''Bolli Bollason's Tale'', is such a narrative about an episode in the life of Bolli Bollason, taken from the 14th century ''Möðruvallabók'' which contains the ''Laxdæla saga''.&lt;ref name="Thorsson422"&gt;Thorsson, p 422&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the tale, a man called Thorolf Stuck-up had a bull which wounded his neighbours' farm animals, damaged haystacks and caused "a great deal of trouble".&lt;ref name="Thorsson422"/&gt;  When an upstanding local farmer named Thord saw the bull damaging the stacks of peat on his farm at Marbaeli, he lunged at the animal with a spear and struck it dead.&lt;ref name="Thorsson422-423"&gt;Thorsson, p 422-423&lt;/ref&gt;  In revenge, Thorolf killed Thord's seven- or eight-year-old son Olaf, to the disgust of Thorolf's wife and kinsmen.&lt;ref name="Thorsson423"&gt;Thorsson, p 423&lt;/ref&gt;  Thorolf fled and eventually secured the protection of Thorvald Hjaltasson, a prominent leader who lived at Hjaltadal.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsson, p 422-424&lt;/ref&gt;  After Christmas, Thorvald secured for him the safekeeping and support of Starri of Guddalir, who often sheltered outlaws.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsson, p 424-425&lt;/ref&gt;

Thord's wife Gudrun, a first cousin of Bolli, asked him to take over the prosecution of the case.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsson, p 424&lt;/ref&gt;  Accompanied by Arnor Crone's-nose and a large company of men, Bolli attended the Hegranes Assembly.&lt;ref name="Thorsson425"&gt;Thorsson, p 425&lt;/ref&gt;  Thorvald and Starri intended to block the prosecution "by force of arms and numbers", but when they realised they were outnumbered, they withdrew and Bolli successfully had Thorolf outlawed.&lt;ref name="Thorsson425"/&gt;  Passage out of Iceland was obtained for Thorolf aboard a merchant vessel at Hrutafjord.&lt;ref name="Thorsson426"&gt;Thorsson, p 426&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Bolli believed it would have been improper if the outlawed Thorolf were to escape, and having ridden north to Hrutafjord, he drew his sword Leg-biter and "struck a blow right through" Thorolf, killing him.&lt;ref name="Thorsson426"/&gt;

{{blockquote|He earned himself a great deal of honour by this, as men thought it quite an accomplishment to have the man outlawed in another district and then venture alone into the hands of his enemies and kill him there.&lt;ref name="Thorsson426"/&gt;}}

===Sneglu-Halla þáttr===
Bolli died during the reign of [[Harald III of Norway]], as is recorded at the end of ''The Tale of Sarcastic Halli''.  The tale makes reference to Bolli's military prowess, in ironic contrast to the tale's protagonist:
{{quote|Harald learned of the deaths of two of his men from Iceland, Bolli the Elegant and Sarcastic Halli.

He said of Boli, "The warrior must have fallen victim to spears."

But of Halli he said, "The poor devil must have burst eating porridge"|&lt;ref&gt;Thorsson, p 712&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--The source gives each sentence a paragraph, but here they have been lumped together for stylistic preference--&gt;}}

==Notes==
#In English versions of the saga, Helgafell and Tunga are sometimes translated as "Holyfell" and "Tongue" respectively.
#[http://omacl.org/Laxdaela/chapter73.html Chapter 73]: "…from what we have heard, no Northman had ever gone to take warpay from the Garth king before Bolli, Bolli's son".  "Northman" in the saga can be taken to mean a "West Norseman" — an Icelander or Norwegian — as [[Old Norse]] had split along East/West lines.  According to the ''[[Annales Bertiniani]]'', the Swedes had reached "''Miklagarðr''" (Constantinople) in the 830s, and many of them were in the service of the Empire prior Bolli's arrival.
#Although the 1899 Muriel Press translation uses the ambiguous "trade-ship" for ''knarrarbátinn'' ([http://omacl.org/Laxdaela/chapter73.html Chapter LXXIII]), the newer 2001 Penguin edition translates it as "cog".

'''C++/WinRT''' is the officially supported, modern C++ language projection for [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Runtime]] platform, designed to provide you with first-class access to the modern [[Windows API]]. The C++/WinRT language projection is ''not'' an extension to the C++ language; rather, it's implemented as an entirely standard modern ISO C++17 header-file-based library. With C++/WinRT, you can author and consume Windows Runtime APIs using any standards-compliant C++17 compiler.

C++/WinRT ships as part of the [[Microsoft Windows SDK]]. It was introduced in version 10.0.17134.0 (Windows 10, version 1803) of the SDK. There is also [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] support for C++/WinRT, by means of project and item templates, as well as MSBuild properties and targets. Visual Studio support is provided in the form of the [https://aka.ms/cppwinrt/vsix/ C++/WinRT Visual Studio Extension] (VSIX), which you can download and install from the [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/ Visual Studio Marketplace].

C++/WinRT was originally released in 2015 by [https://kennykerr.ca/ Kenny Kerr]. Shortly afterward, the technology and Kerr's expertise were brought in-house to [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref name="Kk2Ms"&gt;[https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/mt745090.aspx How Kenny Kerr Brought C++/WinRT to Microsoft] MSDN Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; C++/WinRT is now Microsoft's recommended replacement for both the [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh438466.aspx Windows Runtime C++ Template Library] (WRL), and for [[C++/CX]].&lt;ref name="IntroToCppWinRT"&gt;[https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/intro-to-using-cpp-with-winrt/ Introduction to C++/WinRT] docs.microsoft.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

[[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Runtime]] is based on [[Component Object Model]] (COM) APIs, and it's designed to be accessed through ''language projections''. A language projection hides the COM details, and provides a more natural programming experience for a given language. For C++ developers, C++/WinRT is the officially supported, modern C++ language projection.

As of version 10.0.17134.0 (Windows 10, version 1803), the [[Microsoft Windows SDK]] contains a header-file-based standard C++ library for consuming first-party [[Windows API]]s (that is, [[Windows Runtime]] [[API]]s in Windows namespaces).&lt;ref name="IntroToCppWinRT"/&gt; C++/WinRT also ships with the &lt;code&gt;cppwinrt.exe&lt;/code&gt; tool, which you can point at a [[Windows Runtime]] metadata (.winmd) file to generate a header-file-based standard C++ library that ''projects'' the APIs described in the metadata for consumption from C++/WinRT code. [[Windows Runtime]] metadata (.winmd) files provide a canonical way of describing a Windows Runtime API surface. By pointing the &lt;code&gt;cppwinrt.exe&lt;/code&gt; tool at metadata, you can generate a library for use with any runtime class implemented in a second- or third-party Windows Runtime component, or implemented in your own application.

With C++/WinRT, you can also implement your own runtime classes using standard C++, without resorting to COM-style programming. For a runtime class, you describe your types in a [https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/midl-3/intro/ MIDL file] (.idl), and from that file the &lt;code&gt;midl.exe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cppwinrt.exe&lt;/code&gt; tools generate your implementation boilerplate source code files for you, ready for you to add your implementation. You can alternatively just implement interfaces by deriving from a base class that's part of the C++/WinRT header library. These techniques employ the [[curiously recurring template pattern]] for convenient and performant function-calling via static dispatch. In general, C++/WinRT makes clever and efficient use of a host of modern ISO C++11 (and later) language features to the benefit of developer productivity and run-time performance. Features that were not available when C++/WinRT's predecessors ([https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh438466.aspx WRL] and [[C++/CX]]) were designed.

You use standard C++ data types, algorithms, and keywords when you use C++/WinRT. The projection does have its own custom data types, but in most cases you don't need to learn them because they provide appropriate conversions to and from standard types. That way, you can continue to use the standard C++ language features that you're accustomed to using, and the source code that you already have. C++/WinRT makes it extremely easy to call Windows Runtime APIs in any C++ application, from Win32 to UWP.

C++/WinRT performs better and produces smaller binaries than any other language option for the Windows Runtime. It even outperforms handwritten code using the application binary interface (ABI) directly. That's because the abstractions use modern C++ idioms that the Visual C++ compiler is designed to optimize. This includes magic statics, empty base classes, strlen elision, as well as many newer optimizations in the latest version of [[Microsoft Visual C++]] targeted specifically at improving the performance of C++/WinRT.

== History ==

Design and development of C++/WinRT was begun in 2014 by the then-independent software developer [https://kennykerr.ca/ Kenny Kerr]. At the time, the prevailing way for developers to call [[Windows Runtime]] APIs using C++ was with the [[C++/CX]] language projection. C++/CX adds non-standard extensions to the C++ language, such as the &lt;code&gt;ref new&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; (hat) notation inherited from C++/CLI. It hadn't been fully appreciated then that advances in ISO C++ language features meant that it had become possible to design a Windows Runtime language projection for pure standard C++, without extensions. "There are a lot of very experienced C++ developers at Microsoft who have spent decades-long careers working with C++ and COM," Kerr says. "I think it took someone who didn't realize that it was impossible to just try it anyway and show that it works."&lt;ref name="Kk2Ms"/&gt;

"I had had some previous experience projecting COM APIs into modern C++, so I decided to see whether I could apply those same techniques to the Windows Runtime." One early challenge in developing C++/WinRT was managing the trade-offs that the Windows Runtime makes to support projections for JavaScript and managed .NET languages out of the box. The complexity in the way that generic collections work across language projections is another example of these design challenges, as was coming up with an efficient way for standard C++ to handle the Windows Runtime's interface-versioning model. "It really pushed my understanding of C++ at that time, and it's since pushed the [[Microsoft Visual C++]] compiler to more efficiently handle such techniques at this scale."

=== Name ===

There is good reason for C++/WinRT's name to reference the [[Windows Runtime]] (WinRT), rather than the [[Universal Windows Platform]] (UWP). This is because you can call Windows Runtime APIs (and, therefore, you can benefit from C++/WinRT) in any C++ application, from Win32 to UWP.

[[File:H Hoffmann Struwwel 08.jpg|thumb|275px|Stories about playing with matches do not have [[happy ending]]s.  An illustration from "The Dreadful Story of Pauline and the Matches" from ''[[Struwwelpeter]]'', by [[Heinrich Hoffmann (author)|Heinrich Hoffman]], 1858.]]
A '''cautionary tale''' is a tale told in [[folklore]], to warn its listener of a [[Risk|danger]]. There are three essential parts to a cautionary tale, though they can be introduced in a large variety of ways.  First, a [[taboo]] or prohibition is stated: some act, location, or thing is said to be dangerous. Then, the narrative itself is told: someone disregarded the warning and performed the forbidden act. Finally, the violator comes to an unpleasant fate, which is frequently related in expansive and grisly detail.  

==Cautionary tales and conformity==
Cautionary tales are [[ubiquitous]] in [[popular culture]]; many [[urban legend]]s are framed as cautionary tales: from the lover's lane haunted by a hook-handed [[murder]]er to the tale of a man who shot a [[cactus]] for fun only to die when the plant toppled onto him. Like [[horror fiction]], generally the cautionary tale exhibits an ambivalent attitude towards social taboos.  The narrator of a cautionary tale is momentarily excused from the ordinary demands of [[etiquette]] that discourages the use of gruesome or disgusting imagery because the tale serves to reinforce some other social taboo.  

Cautionary tales are also frequently utilised to spread awareness of [[morality|moral]] issues, and for this reason are often told to children to make them conform to rules that either protect them or are for their own safety.

Those whose job it is to enforce [[conformity]] therefore frequently resort to cautionary tales. The [[German language]] anthology, ''[[Struwwelpeter]]'', contains tales such as "Die gar traurige Geschichte mit dem Feuerzeug" (The Dreadful Story of Pauline and the Matches); it is fairly easy to deduce the ending from the title.  [[Social guidance film]]s such as ''[[Boys Beware]]'' or ''[[Reefer Madness]]'' are deliberately patterned after traditional cautionary tales, as were the notorious [[driver's education]] films (''[[Red Asphalt]]'', ''[[Signal 30]]'') of the 1960s, or military films about [[syphilis]] and other [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.  The framework of the cautionary tale became a [[cliché]] in the [[slasher film]]s of the 1980s, in which [[adolescent]]s who had [[sexual intercourse|sex]], drank [[alcoholic beverage]]s, or smoked [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] inevitably ended up as the victims of the [[serial killer]] [[villain]].  

On the other hand, in the adolescent culture of the [[United States]], for more than a hundred years the traditional cautionary tale gave rise to the phenomenon of [[legend tripping]], in which a cautionary tale is turned into the basis of a dare that invites the hearer to test the taboo by breaking it.

==Reactions to cautionary tales==
The genre of the cautionary tale has been satirized by several writers. [[Hilaire Belloc]] in his ''[[Cautionary Tales for Children]]'' presented such moral examples as "Jim, Who ran away from his Nurse, and was eaten by a Lion", and "Matilda, Who told lies, and was Burned to Death". [[Lewis Carroll]], in ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', says that Alice:

{{blockquote|"had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they ''would'' not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger ''very'' deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked "poison", it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later."}}

In ''[[The Complete Tribune Printer]]'', [[Eugene Field]] gave cautionary tales an ironic inversion, as in ''The Gun:''
{{blockquote|This is a gun. Is the Gun loaded? Really, I do not know. Let us Find out. Put the Gun on the table, and you, Susie, blow down one barrel while you, Charlie, blow down the other. Bang! Yes, it was loaded. Run quick, Jennie, and pick up Susie's head and Charlie's lower Jaw before the Nasty Blood gets over the New carpet.}}

Some films, such as ''[[Gremlins]]'', satirized this framework by imposing very arbitrary rules whose violation results in horrendous consequences for the community by not taking responsibility.

Cautionary tales are sometimes heavily criticized for their ham-fisted approach to [[ethics]].{{Fact|date=December 2007}} ''[[The Cold Equations]]'' is a well-known example. In the story, a man has to eject a young woman out of the airlock, otherwise his rocket will not have enough fuel to deliver some badly needed serum, without which everyone at a small outpost would perish. Her death is justified because she ignored a 'no entry' sign, "when the laws of physics say no, they don't mean maybe", and no other solution would reduce the weight of the ship enough to complete the trip safely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8610">'''Child's Play Touring Theatre''' (CPTT) is a non-profit arts-education touring theatre company based in [[Chicago]]. Founded in 1978 by June and Victor Podagrosi, CPTT was the first theatre company where professional actors take original works written by children and perform them on stage.&lt;ref&gt;de Blasio, Don. "Touring Theater 'Child's Play'," ''The Champaign-Urbana News Gazette'', 6 July 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Since its founding, CPTT has performed in 40 states from Alaska to Florida and Maine to California, reaching an audience of over 4.5 million and performing the works of over 17,000 young writers.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptt.org/about_us/index.html |title=About Us |publisher=Cptt.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Child's Play Touring Theatre was founded in 1978 by Victor and June Podagrosi in [[Champaign, IL]] while Victor was teaching theatre at [[Parkland College]]. The idea for CPTT emerged after Victor was asked to stage a performance of children's writings at a Young Author's awards ceremony and was inspired by their storytelling abilities. Victor said he enjoyed using the writings of children "because there's so much truth in there. Their imagination is so very pure and simple."&lt;ref name="suntimes"&gt;Taubeneck, Anne. "Cast ballot for Child's Play," ''Chicago Sun-Times'', 4 November 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; CPTT became a non-for-profit organization in 1980 and relocated to [[Chicago]] in 1982.

Since its founding, Child's Play has performed at a number of notable venues including the [[Goodman Theatre]], [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]], [[Ravinia]], [[Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center]], [[The Field Museum]], [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)]] and at events such as [[International Children's Festival at Wolf Trap]].&lt;ref name="suntimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ib"&gt;Callison, Bradley. "Child's Play Theatre Encourages Educational Creativity," ''Illinois Business'' Winter 1996: 46-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
Child's Play is a nationally recognized 501(c)(3) non-for-profit organization that is entirely self-funded through donations and sponsorships. Sponsors have included [[National Endowment for the Arts]], [[Turtle Wax]], [[Dykema Gossett]], and [[DeVry, Inc.]] CPTT relies primarily upon the support of volunteers.

=== Mission ===

Child's Play has a threefold artistic, educational and organizational mission:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptt.org/about_us/mission.html |title=Mission &amp;#124; About Us |publisher=Cptt.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artistic'''&lt;br /&gt;
To share, encourage, and validate the creativity of children by performing original works of theatre, music and dance adapted from literature written by young authors.

'''Educational'''&lt;br /&gt;
To motivate children to write and think creatively and to enhance writing education in schools by sharing drama-based approaches to writing instruction.

'''Organizational'''&lt;br /&gt;
To elevate the status of theatre for young people by providing full-time employment to theatre artists.

== Educational Programs ==

CPTT offers a variety of educational programs for students and teachers alike. Some of these programs include summer camps, classes and after school programs for children and teens, teacher workshops and writing workshops for students.

=== Notable Projects ===

Over the years, CPTT has produced a number of notable shows and educational programs. Some of these projects include:

*'''''Kids for President!''''' - (1988, 1992, 1996, 2008, 2012) Produced in election years, ''Kids for President'' gives children "a unique opportunity to learn about the issues that are important to them and the election." &lt;ref name="Ctribune"&gt;"Child's Play: Making Politics and Government Dramatic" ''Chicago Tribune'', 1 October 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kids for President!'' was the keynote performance at the national Kid's Convention of '96 at Chicago's [[Whitney Young Magnet High School|Whitney Young High School]] held after the [[Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name="ib" /&gt; CPTT also performed ''Kids for President!'' at the [[Chicago Theatre]] for the book signing of [[Hillary Clinton]]'s ''[[It Takes a Village]]''.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;
*'''''Hands Together, Heart to Art''''' - (2005, 2006) - A summer program for children who have experienced the death of one or both parents. ''Hands Together, Heart to Art'' became a finalist in the NCASS Creative and Innovative Awards Program.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptt.org/about_us/history/ |title=History &amp;#124; About Us |publisher=Cptt.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''The Great Green Adventures of R-Man and Earth Kid''''' - (2010–Present) A [[comic book]] style show based on stories and poems written by children from around the country that shows how kids think the planet can be saved.
*'''''Global Energy: The Musical''''' - (2011) CPTT's most recent ongoing project focuses on different types of energy used throughout the world today and on global conservation efforts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9504">'''Community theatre''' refers to [[Theatre|theatrical performance]] made in relation to particular [[Community|communities]]—its usage includes theatre made by, with, and for a community. It may refer to theatre that is made entirely by a community with no outside help, or to a collaboration between community members and professional theatre artists, or to performance made entirely by professionals that is addressed to a particular community. Community theatres range in size from small groups led by single individuals that perform in borrowed spaces to large permanent companies with well-equipped facilities of their own. Many community theatres are successful, non-profit businesses with a large active membership and, often, a full-time professional staff. Community theatre is often [[devised theatre|devised]] and may draw on popular theatrical forms, such as [[carnival]], [[circus]], and [[parade]]s, as well as performance modes from commercial theatre.

Community theatre is understood to contribute to the [[social capital]] of a community, insofar as it develops the skills, community spirit, and artistic sensibilities of those who participate, whether as producers or audience-members. It is used as a tool for [[Theatre for Development|social development]], promoting ideas like gender equality, human rights, environment and democracy. Most of the community theatre practices have been developed based on the philosophy of education theorist [[Paulo Freire]]'s approach of [[Pedagogy of the Oppressed|critical pedagogy in theatre]] and implementation techniques built by [[Augusto Boal]], known as [[Theatre of the Oppressed]]. Freire's approach attempted to stimulate social change by encouraging the audience to build capacities for critical thinking through participation in active dialogue. The participants would identify issues of concerns and discuss possible solutions, with an enhanced tolerance for different perspectives with regard to the same problem. Such plays are then rarely performed in traditional playhouses but rather staged on streets, public places, in traditional meeting spaces, schools, prisons, or other institutions, inviting an alternative and often spontaneous audience to watch.&lt;ref&gt;Scharinger, J. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Community theatre is distinct from [[amateur theatre]] which, while it may be community-based, is non-professional.

==In Latin America==
Partly inspired by [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s interpretation of culture, the seminal [[theatre practitioner]] [[Augusto Boal]] developed a series of techniques known as the [[Theatre of the Oppressed]] from his work developing community theatre in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Boal (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United Kingdom==
In Britain the term "community theatre" is sometimes used to distinguish theatre made by professional theatre artists with or for particular communities from that made entirely by non-professionals, which is usually known as "[[amateur theatre]]" or "amateur dramatics."&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 911).&lt;/ref&gt; Notable practitioners include [[Joan Littlewood]] and her [[Theatre Workshop]], [[John McGrath (playwright)|John McGrath]] and [[Elizabeth MacLennan]] and their [[7:84]] company, [[Welfare State International]],&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 911-912), MacLennan (1990), McGrath (1981, 1990, 1996), Coult and Kershaw (1983), Kershaw (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ann Jellicoe]] founder of the Colway Theatre Trust, now known as the Claque Theatre and run by UK practitioner Jon Oram.

==In the Netherlands==
Community theatre in the [[Netherlands]] came about after the ending of the "theater-in-education" movement.  This "theatre-in-education" movement lasted from 1970-1985.  The big theatre in the Netherlands which was created originally for "theatre-in-education" and subsequently community theatre is the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110724165755/http://www.stut.nl/english.html Stut Theatre.]  This theatre idea was started in 1977 by Jos Bours and Marlies Hautvast, who when they first starting creating plays at the Stut Theatre, realized this kind of community-theatre had a complete different approach from "theatre-in-education."

==In the United States==
{{see also|Regional theater in the United States}}
Community theatre in the United States was an outgrowth of the [[Little Theatre Movement]], a reform movement which began in 1912 in reaction to massive Victorian [[melodrama]]tic theatre spectacles.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 238-239) and Noe (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the country’s oldest extant community theatre group, the [[Footlight Club]], has existed since the 19th century and performed every year since 1877.

The [http://www.aact.org American Association of Community Theatre] represents community theaters in the U.S., its territories, and its military bases around the world.

==In Canada==
[[Theatre Passe Muraille]] sent ensemble casts into rural communities to record local stories, songs, accents and lifestyle. Their employment of [[collective creation]] was thus taken to an unheard of scale and spread across Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Passe Muraille |url= http://www.canadiantheatre.com/dict.pl?term=Theatre%20Passe%20Muraille |accessdate= April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passe Muraille facilitated the first production of [[Codco]], which employed personal experiences of Newfoundland culture in their shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Codco |url= http://www.canadiantheatre.com/dict.pl?term=Codco |accessdate= April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.cbu.ca/campus/boardmore-playhouse/ The Boardmore Playhouse], named in honor of [http://www.canadiantheatre.com/dict.pl?term=Boardmore%2C%20Liz%20and%20Harry Elizabeth and Harry Boardmore], is a 337-seat venue which is the centre for the performing arts at [[Cape Breton University]]. The Playhouse is home to CBU Boardmore Theatre which presents an annual season of plays, including plays for young audiences, four to five full-length plays, a bi-annual Shakespeare production and a bi-annual Broadway Musical, and a one-week one act play festival with an emphasis on new play development. Throughout the school year and summer months the CBU Boardmore Playhouse is also involved with a number of community projects. The Playhouse provides practical expertise to community theatre groups in the form of workshops for young people as well as advice and leadership in summer theatre programs. Open auditions are held each September for anyone interested in getting involved in any aspect of the theatre. Auditions are held the weekend following the first week of classes.

==In Australia==
In [[Western Australia]], there is a substantial number of community theatre groups who have banded together to form the Independent Theatre Association.&lt;ref name="ITA"&gt;{{cite web |title= Independent Theatre Association|url= http://www.ita.org.au/ |accessdate= January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Conversation in the Cathedral''''' (original title: ''Conversación en la catedral'') is a 1969 novel by Peruvian writer and essayist [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], translated by [[Gregory Rabassa]]. One of Vargas Llosa's major works, it is a portrayal of [[Peru]] under the dictatorship of [[Manuel A. Odría]] in the 1950s, and deals with the lives of characters from different [[social strata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Kristal |1998|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ambitious narrative is built around the stories of Santiago Zavala and Ambrosio respectively; one the son of a minister, the other his chauffeur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Kristal |1998|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; A random meeting at a [[dog pound]] leads to a riveting conversation between the two at a nearby bar known as the Cathedral (hence the title).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castro-Klarén|1990|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the encounter Zavala tries to find the truth about his father's role in the murder of a notorious Peruvian underworld figure, shedding light on the workings of a dictatorship along the way.
[[File:Universidad mayor de san marcos.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The quatricentenary [[National University of San Marcos]], where the protagonist Santiago Zavala studies.&lt;/small&gt;]]
The protagonist of the novel Santiago Zavala, is a student of the [[National University of San Marcos]] in [[Lima]] and an activist with the group [[Cahuide]] against the dictatorship of the government of Peru; Santiago is based on some real life experiences of Vargas Llosa, during his first years at [[University of San Marcos]] and as a member of the activist group [[Cahuide]]. In the novel, the protagonist Santiago Zavala depicts a pessimistic view of Peruvian society during the 1950s, at the same time he is embracing the mediocrity. More generally, the novel is an examination of the deep roots of corruption and failure in Peruvian politics and government during the 1950s. The second sentence of the English translation of the novel poses the question "At what precise moment had Peru fucked itself up?"&lt;ref&gt;Vargas Llosa, Mario. "Conversations in the Cathedral." Trans. Gregory Rabassa.  New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Creative Industries Federation''' is a national organisation for all the UK's creative industries, cultural education and arts. It advocates for the sector, aiming to ensure that the creative industries are central to political, economic and social decision-making.

Through this advocacy and by leveraging the combined influence of its 1,000+ members across all creative sectors, the Federation further seeks to secure the investment required to retain the creative industries' position as the fastest growing sector of the UK economy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/anne-mcelvoy-can-britains-creative-industries-finally-get-their-act-together-9884864.html | date = 26 November 2014 | accessdate = 2 January 2015 | first = Anne | last = McElvoy | newspaper = [[London Evening Standard]] | title = Anne McElvoy: Can Britain's creative industries finally get their act together?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbi.org.uk/business-issues/creative-industries/|title=Creative industries - CBI|website=www.cbi.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; currently worth £91.8bn in Gross Value Added to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/27-november-3-december-2017/creative-sectors-worth-92bn-uk-economy-government-research-reveals/|title=Creative sectors worth £92bn to UK economy, Government research reveals|last=|first=|date=30 November 2017|work=Design Week|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Federation was the brainchild of [[John Sorrell (designer)|Sir John Sorrell]],&lt;ref name="telegraph-williams"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/11248763/Creative-industries-join-forces-to-lobby-Government.html | date = 23 Nov 2014 | accessdate = 2 January 2015 | first = Christopher | last = Williams | newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | title = Creative industries join forces to lobby Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-brown"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/01/john-kampfner-creative-industries-federation-austerity-fears-arts | date =  1 January 2015 | accessdate = 2 January 2015 | first = Mark | last = Brown | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | title = Head of Creative Industries Federation fears ‘dangerous’ cost of austerity}}&lt;/ref&gt; the designer and UK business ambassador, and a team of creative leaders including [[Peter Bazalgette|Sir Peter Bazalgette]], [[Nicholas Serota|Sir Nicholas Serota]], [[Tim Davie]] of [[BBC Worldwide]], [[Caroline Rush]] of the [[British Fashion Council]], [[Amanda Nevill]] of the [[British Film Institute]] and [[Darren Henley]].

The ambition of the Federation was to give political clout to a sector that has been the fastest growing part of the UK economy over the previous decade, but had never punched above its weight with government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/anne-mcelvoy-can-britains-creative-industries-finally-get-their-act-together-9884864.html|title=Can Britain's creative industries finally get their act together?|last=|first=|date=26 November 2014|work=London Evening Standard|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operations commenced in March 2014, with early development of the organisation led by the Federation's founding CEO, [[John Kampfner]], and originally funded by more than 200 founder supporters prior to the launch of its membership scheme.&lt;ref name="guardian-brown" /&gt;

The Creative Industries Federation was officially launched in November 2014 with an event at [[Central Saint Martins|Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design]]. This event was attended by more than 500 people from across the creative industries and featured keynote speeches by [[George Osborne]], [[Martha Lane Fox]] and UK President of Warner Bros, Josh Berger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tbivision.com/2014/11/25/creative-industries-federation-launches-uk/|title=Creative Industries Federation launches in the UK|last=|first=|date=25 November 2014|website=TBI Vision|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federation's membership scheme commenced in January 2015.&lt;ref name="broadcastnow"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/indies/uk-creative-industries-launch-federation/5080325.article | date = 24 November 2014 | accessdate = 2 January 2015 | first = Andreas | last = Wiseman | publisher = [[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]] | title = UK creative industries launch federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.designweek.co.uk/news/uks-first-independent-membership-organisation-for-the-creative-industries-launches/3039448.article | date = 25 November 2014| accessdate = 2 January 2015 | first = Angus | last = Montgomery | publisher = [[Design Week]] | title = UK’s "first independent membership organisation for the creative industries" launches}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its first year of operation, the Federation forged working relations with the UK government and political parties of all hues, working closely with eight Whitehall departments as well as devolved and city administrations and local authorities. Its work helped secure a better-than-expected settlement for the arts in the November 2015 spending review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/nov/25/arts-council-museums-galleries-relief-funding-settlement-autumn-statement|title=Arts leaders relieved at better-than-expected funding agreement|last=|first=|date=25 November 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Federation's survey prior to the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 EU Referendum]] revealed that 96% of its members backed remaining in the EU,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2016/05/31/creative-industries-federation-members-96-per-cent-against-brexit-eu-referendum/|title=UK creatives reject Brexit, according to poll|last=|first=|date=31 May 2016|website=Dezeen|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Federation continued to canvas its members and produce a series of events and reports to help inform UK government policy with regards to Brexit and its potential impact on the creative industries. In February 2017, Creative Industries Federation former CEO, [[John Kampfner]], was invited to present evidence on this issue to a [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport|DCMS]] Select Committee,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/culture-media-and-sport-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/impact-of-brexit-16-17/publications/|title=The impact of Brexit on the creative industries, tourism and the digital single market inquiry - publications|website=UK Parliament|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside [[Peter Bazalgette|Sir Peter Bazalgette]], then chair of Arts Council England, and [[Nicola Mendelsohn]], Vice President EMEA, Facebook.

In March 2017, the Federation announced the appointment of its new chair, [[Richard Haythornthwaite|Rick Haythornthwaite]], who succeeded founding chair [[John Sorrell (designer)|Sir John Sorrell]] in April 2017.

In July 2018, Alan Bishop, former CEO of the Southbank Centre, succeeded John Kampfner as CEO of the Creative Industries Federation.

'''Else Berg''' (19 February 1877, [[Racibórz|Ratibor]] - 19 November 1942, [[Auschwitz]]) was a German-born Dutch painter of Jewish descent; associated with the [[Bergense School]]. She was married to the Dutch painter, [[Mommie Schwarz]].

== Biography ==
[[File:Berg-Selfportrait2.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Self-portrait with Brushes (1929)]]
Her family was originally from [[Prussia]], but moved East in an attempt to improve their circumstances. Her father was a [[Reform Judaism|Liberal]] Jew and owned a cigar factory. In 1895, she began her studies at the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Antwerp]]. Five years later, with the financial support of her parents, she continued at the [[Berlin University of the Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;Profile @ the [[Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie]]&lt;/ref&gt; where she studied with [[Arthur Kampf]]. According to some sources, she also studied in [[Paris]].

In 1905, she met Mommie Schwarz, who had recently returned from New York and had come to [[Berlin]] to study [[German Expressionism]]. They went to Paris together to have a look at the latest artistic trends there. The following year, they settled in Amsterdam and became part of the [[Modern Art]] movement. For many years, they travelled together, although they kept separate studios. In 1920 they were married and, four years later, she became a naturalized Dutch citizen.&lt;ref name="S"&gt;[http://www.schilderijen-site.nl/woordenboek/else-berg/ Brief biography] @ Schilderijen Site.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite financial difficulties, they continued to travel throughout Eastern Europe, Italy and France. They also had an extended stay on [[Mallorca]], with [[Leo Gestel]] and his wife, where they took up [[Cubism]].&lt;ref name="S" /&gt; As the [[Nazi]]s came to power, many of their friends and family left for England or the United States.

Initially, they felt safe in Amsterdam, but they refused to wear the "[[Yellow badge|Yellow Badge]]" when it became mandatory and went into hiding in [[Baambrugge]]. They were apparently betrayed. In November 1942 they were arrested and sent to Auschwitz, where they were put to death shortly after their arrival.&lt;ref name="S" /&gt;

'''''Eltingville''''' (also referred to as '''''The Eltingville Club''''') is the name given to a series of comics created by [[Evan Dorkin]]. The series ran in his comic books ''Dork'' and ''House of Fun'' before it received a two-issue run through [[Dark Horse Comics]] in 2014. ''Eltingville'' was adapted into [[Welcome to Eltingville|a pilot]] for [[Cartoon Network|Cartoon Network's]] [[Adult Swim]] programming block in 2002, but was not picked up for an official series. The series has won three [[Eisner Award]]s, beginning with the 1995 story ''Bring Me the Head of Boba Fett''.&lt;ref name=EA1&gt;{{cite web|title=1996 Will Eisner Comic Industry Award Nominees and Winners|url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/eisner96.php|publisher=Hahn Library Comic Book Awards Almanac|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the series' title, Dorkin chose to name the series ''Eltingville'' after [[Eltingville, Staten Island]], where he worked off and on in a comic book store for six years.&lt;ref name=CA1 /&gt;

==Synopsis==
The ''Eltingville'' comics surround a group of four teen boys (Bill, Pete, Josh, and Jerry) in [[Eltingville, Staten Island]] that are interested in various different elements of [[geek culture]], with each character showing a specific interest in one area. Dorkin has described the characters as "four older teenagers who are fans, and they’re possibly some of the worst fans who have ever lived."&lt;ref name=CA1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sims |first1=Chris |title=Evan Dorkin On The (Final) Return Of ‘The Eltingville Club’ [NYCC 2013] |url=http://comicsalliance.com/evan-dorkin-the-eltingville-club-interview-nycc-2013/ |publisher=Comics Alliance |accessdate=15 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704085358/http://comicsalliance.com/evan-dorkin-the-eltingville-club-interview-nycc-2013/ |archivedate=4 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series places the characters in various scenarios that Dorkin utilizes to parody common stereotypes and situations that he or others have come across in comic book and geek fandom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Jason|title=Manga: The Complete Guide|date=2012|publisher=Random House|isbn=9780345539441|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GvEFDD4rdWMC&amp;pg=PT450&amp;dq=%22eltingville+club%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pY6aU7aEObDesAT7moJg&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22eltingville%20club%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBR2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sunu|first1=Steve|title=DORKIN DISCUSSES "BEASTS OF BURDEN," BIDS FAREWELL TO "THE ELTINGVILLE CLUB"|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=51265|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
*'''William "Bill" Dickey''': Bill is the de facto leader of the quartet and is shown to have a heavy interest in comic books and sci-fi shows and movies. He has an extremely overbearing personality and is greatly disliked by his peers, including the other members of the Eltingville club. In ''This Fan, This Monster'' he is hired to work at the local comic book store ''Joe's Fantasy World'' and quickly allows the power to go to his head, resulting in the store's destruction. He is of average build and wears glasses. In the comic series, it has been mentioned that he has a younger brother, but in the pilot his brother is replaced with a younger sister, Jane. Bill has been frequently implied to be the most sadistic and sociopathic of the four, as he attempted to murder his whole club and Joe by setting fire to his store in a fit of insanity. During the final issue of the comics Bill is shown to have unsuccessfully transitioned into adulthood as he is still living at home, is still a virgin, has had at least one failed business, and is more unpleasant than he was before, as his bitterness towards life and women has further warped his personality. 
*'''Joshua "Josh" Levy''': Josh is an overweight Jewish teen with glasses and dark hair who is heavily interested in sci-fi films, books, and television shows, especially anything ''[[Star Wars]]'' related. He is one of Bill's primary antagonists in the series and the two often get into fights, either verbal or physical, which ends in either Pete, Jerry, or both of them to break it up. Dorkin has stated that Josh is a composite of two different people that he knows.&lt;ref name=N1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arrant|first1=Chris|title=Evan Dorkin Lampoons The Dark Side of Comic Fandom In ELTINGVILLE CLUB Finale|url=http://www.newsarama.com/20534-evan-dorkin-lampoons-the-dark-side-of-comic-fandom-in-eltingville-club-finale.html|publisher=Newsarama|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is implied that he has a somewhat weak mother, as she takes strong medications and gets heart attacks. As an adult Josh is depicted as working for a comic book news website, with the hopes that it will serve as a stepping stone to becoming a comic book writer, despite his fiction writing getting repeatedly rejected by publishers and his former college professor.
*'''Peter "Pete" DiNunzio''': Pete is primarily interested in horror. He is somewhat based upon a friend of Dorkin's as well as a "certain kind of [[Staten Island]] resident".&lt;ref name=N1/&gt; Pete has dark hair, is shorter than his counterparts, and is of otherwise average build. It has been mentioned in the comics that Pete has a younger sister and several older brothers. In the final issue Pete is a mostly bald adult that has found employment as a member of a film crew that specializes in creating horror porn, a position that he frequently uses to exploit desperate female performers.
*'''Jerry Stokes''': Jerry is more quiet than his counterparts and is interested in fantasy role playing games and gaming in general. His meek demeanor causes his fellow club members to view him with some disgust, as evidenced in ''This Fan, This Monster'' where Pete uses gaming terms to insult him and Bill later rants that Jerry has never really made any of his "[[saving throw]]s". Jerry is based upon several different people.&lt;ref name=N1/&gt; Jerry is of average weight and height and has blond hair. He has a habit of imitating Twiki and appears to be of a pacifistic nature. Jerry's real name has been said to be Jerome, but in ''This Fan, This Monster'', his real name is Gerald. At the end of the series Jerry is shown to be the most successful of the former club, as he has found employment as a professional ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' player, has a much higher sense of self-esteem, and is dating a beautiful, popular female pop and geek culture correspondent.
*'''Joe Gargagliano''': Joe is an overweight, slovenly adult male and the owner of ''Joe's Fantasy World''. He is shown to have little to no morals when it comes to selling items and frequently mistreats his customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacDonald|first1=Heidi|title=PREVIEW: THE ELTINGVILLE CLUB #1 takes on Fake Geek Girls and so much more|url=http://comicsbeat.com/preview-eltingville-1-takes-on-fake-geek-girls-and-so-much-more/|publisher=Comics Beat|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also has a book containing nicknames for different customers, including the Eltingville club. At the end of ''This Fan, This Monster'' Joe's comic book store is destroyed in a fire.

==Publishing history==
The first ''Eltingville'' story was an untitled strip that ran in the first issue of ''[[Instant Piano]]'' in 1994. Dorkin initially intended for the strip to be a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]], but chose to continue writing ''Eltingville'' themed stories due to reader response and his own enjoyment of the comic.&lt;ref name=CA1 /&gt; Following stories were published through various different publications such as ''Dork'', ''House of Fun'', and ''Dark Horse Presents''. ''Eltingville'' was published in the [[United Kingdom]] in ''[[Deadline (magazine)|Deadline]]'' as well as in [[Spain]], where strips ran in the Spanish language magazine ''[[El Vibora]]'' and a collection of the strips were published in 2007 as ''El Club Eltingville De Comics, Ciencia-Ficcion, Fantasia, Terror y Juegos de Rol''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dorkin|first1=Evan|title=El club Eltingville de comic, ciencia-ficcion, fantasia, terror y juegos de rol|date=2007|publisher=LA Cupula Ediciones|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/El_club_Eltingville_de_comic_ciencia_fic.html?id=-gvAPAAACAAJ|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dorkin|first1=Evan|title=The Nightmare Almost Realized: The Eltingville Club Complete HC Collection|url=http://evandorkin.livejournal.com/306935.html|publisher=Evan Dorkin|accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Dorkin came up with the idea for ''Eltingville'' after witnessing comic book publisher and author [[Dan Vado]] receive abuse while he was working with [[DC Comics]].&lt;ref name=CA1 /&gt; Vado [[killed off]] the popular character [[Ice (comics)|Ice]] while writing "[[Justice League America]]", which caused various fans to send him [[death threats]] and [[hate mail]].&lt;ref name=CA1 /&gt; He published the first strip in ''Instant Piano'' in 1994 and ended up writing follow up stories in the ''Eltingville'' world over a period of 20 years. The ''Eltingville'' characters are an exaggerated portrayal of several people that Dorkin knows and also draws on Dorkin's own likes and experiences as a fan, retailer, and professional.&lt;ref name=N1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arrant|first1=Chris|title=Evan Dorkin's BEASTS Collected, Soon to Meet HELLBOY|url=http://www.newsarama.com/5515-evan-dorkin-s-beasts-collected-soon-to-meet-hellboy.html|publisher=Newsarama|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are meant to portray the fanbase that does not "change or evolve" to embrace changes in geek culture such as the "increasing acceptance and swell of fandom", as they see their fandom as making up their entire identity and being.&lt;ref name="CBR2"/&gt;

Dorkin has received both praise and backlash from readers over his description of comic book readers and the geek fandom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Means Shannon|first1=Hannah|title=Maxx’s Super Awesome Comic Review Show – From The Flash To Eltingville Club And Original Sin|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2014/06/04/maxxs-super-awesome-comic-review-show-from-the-flash-to-eltingville-club-and-original-sin/|publisher=Bleeding Cool|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davisson |first1=Zack |title=Review: House of Fun (one-shot) |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/5222/review-house-of-fun-one-shot/ |publisher=Comics Bulletin |accessdate=15 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130193649/http://comicsbulletin.com/reviews/5222/review-house-of-fun-one-shot/ |archivedate=30 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cheng|first1=Jennifer|title=THE ELTINGVILLE CLUB #1 (review)|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&amp;id=7246|publisher=CBR|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of ''Eltingville's'' humor, he has stated that "The humor is supposed to hit close to home, ''Eltingville'''s a joke but it's supposed to be an uncomfortable one, it's not about cuddly, cute, awkward fans, it's always been about the unsocial, self-absorbed, arrogant little tyrants that make fandom a less fun place, the idiots who make death threats to creators and rape threats against women writing about sexism in the video game industry, who flip out about the casting of an actor playing a fictional character, who argue the most ridiculous points of trivia as if they honestly matter in the scheme of things, who put fantasy above reality and don't know how to behave like credible human beings and go bonkers if they're called on that behavior.

The '''Gold Medal''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''Medal Aur'') of the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] is awarded annually in three categories for excellence in [[Fine art|Fine Art]], [[Architecture]], or Craft and Design.&lt;ref name=BBCblog2012&gt;{{cite web|author=Chamberlain, Laura |title=2012 Eisteddfod: Gold medal round-up |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/entries/cc474fae-1eff-3692-aef2-db4af1a660cb |publisher=[[BBC]] Blogs |date=7 August 2012 |accessdate=7 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The National Eisteddfod of Wales is [[Wales]]' most important national cultural event, taking place annually. Its open exhibition of art and craft, ''[[Y Lle Celf]]'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: 'The Art Space') is one of the highlights of the Welsh arts calendar.&lt;ref name=goingforgold&gt;{{cite web |title=Going for gold |work=|publisher=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]] |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Going+for+gold%3B+Wales+Millennium+Centre+is+counting+down+to+its+10th...-a0359460344 |date=17 January 2014 |accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold medals are awarded in the [[Visual arts|Visual Arts]] section for outstanding contributions in different media: a Gold Medal for Fine Art has been awarded since 1951;&lt;ref name=fineart&gt;{{cite web |title=Gold Medal for Fine Art |url=http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk/english/about-us/our-history/winners/gold-medal-for-fine-art/ |publisher=The National Eisteddfod of Wales |accessdate=7 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a medal for Architecture has been offered since 1954 (though withheld and not awarded between 1954 and 1959);&lt;ref name=architecture&gt;{{cite web |title=Gold Medal for Architecture |url=http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk/english/about-us/our-history/winners/gold-medal-for-architecture/ |publisher=The National Eisteddfod of Wales |accessdate=7 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Gold Medal for Craft and Design has been awarded since 1985.&lt;ref name=craftanddesign&gt;{{cite web |title=Gold Medal for Craft and Design |url=http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk/english/about-us/our-history/winners/gold-medal-for-craft-and-design/ |publisher=The National Eisteddfod of Wales |accessdate=7 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other awards are the Tony Goble Award, given to a first time exhibitor, and the Josef Herman Award, chosen by the public&lt;ref name=morais2014&gt;{{cite web |author=Morais, Joao |title=Eisteddfod 2014: National Open Exhibition |url=http://www.walesartsreview.org/eisteddfod-2014-national-open-exhibition/ |work=Wales Arts Review|year=2014 |volume=3 |issue=16 |accessdate=20 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Josef Herman]], a Polish emigree, won the Fine Art medal in 1962).&lt;ref name=BBC2011&gt;{{cite web |author=Chamberlain, Laura |title=Archbishop of Canterbury to present Eisteddfod art award |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/posts/archbishop_of_canterbury_to_present_eisteddfod_art_award |work=BBC Wales |format=blog |date=26 July 2011|accessdate=20 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Architecture award was endowed by [[Thomas Alwyn Lloyd]] and is given in conjunction with the [[Design Commission for Wales]] and the [[Royal Society of Architects in Wales]], who advise the Eisteddfod judges.&lt;ref name=BBCblog2012 /&gt;

The award is given to practitioners working in Wales, and a language rule has been in force since 1950 that any original words in art works must be in the [[Welsh language]].&lt;ref name=BBCwindeterred&gt;{{cite news|author=Thomas, Huw |title=Eisteddfod's Welsh language rule could deter artist Josephine Sowden |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-25628182 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=7 January 2014 |accessdate=8 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 there was controversy when a [[Video art|video]] entirely in [[English language|English]] by England-born [[University of Wales, Newport|University of Wales Newport]] student Josephine Sowden was awarded the Fine Art medal.&lt;ref name=WOwindeterred&gt;{{cite news|author=Morgan, Sion |title=Eisteddfod winner deterred by festival's language policy |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/eisteddfod-winner-deterred-festivals-language-6477961 |publisher=[[Wales Online]] |date=7 January 2014 |accessdate=7 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Language row breaks out over Eisteddfod gold medal |url=http://www.itv.com/news/wales/update/2013-08-09/language-row-breaks-out-over-eisteddfod-gold-medal/ |publisher=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV News]] |date=9 August 2013 |accessdate=7 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014 the [[Wales Millennium Centre]] (WMC) and [[Craft in the Bay]], [[Cardiff]] held an exhibition showcasing the work of previous winners of the Fine Art and the Craft awards.&lt;ref name=goingforgold /&gt;

The 2014 Open Exhibition exhibited the work of 44 artists, selected from 300 entries.&lt;ref name=morais2014 /&gt;

'''Henri Alfred Marie Jacquemart''' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃ʁi alfʁɛd maʁi ʒakmaʁ}}) (24 February 1824 in [[Paris]] &amp;ndash; 4 January 1896 in Paris),&lt;ref&gt;Benezit, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''Le Figaro'', 6 Jan 1896, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; often known as '''Alfred Jacquemart''', was a noted French sculptor and [[animalier]]. He usually signed his works: ''A. Jacquemart''.

Jacquemart studied under painter [[Paul Delaroche]] and sculptor Jean Baptiste Jules Klagmann.&lt;ref&gt;Benezit, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in 1845.

Jacquemart exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] from 1847–1879, receiving medals in 1857, 1863 and 1865. He traveled in Egypt and Turkey, and was commissioned by the city of Alexandria, Egypt, to create a colossal statue of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]].

He sculpted in large, medium and small scale. Many of his works were cast in bronze by the [[:fr:Val d'Osne|Val d' Osne foundry]] and some by the silversmith [[Christofle]].&lt;ref&gt;Payne, p.408&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, however, he earned his reputation for his many larger animal works. In 1870 Jacquemart became a Chevalier of the [[Légion d'honneur]].

Jacquemart died suddenly at his apartment in the Rue de Babylone, Paris on the night of 4 January 1896.&lt;ref&gt;''La Croix'', 7 Jan 1896, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral was delayed until 13 January for the arrival of his son, Maurice, who lived in Tunis and was held at the Eglise Saint Thomas d'Aquin, Paris.&lt;ref&gt;''La Presse'', 8 Jan 1896, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''La Temps'', 6 Jan 1896, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selected works ==
* ''Sphinxes'' (four), La [[Fontaine du Palmier]], Paris, 1858
* ''Chimera'' (two), La [[Fontaine Saint-Michel]], Paris, c.1860
* ''Evangelists'' (four), [[Église Saint-Augustin de Paris]], 1862
* ''Valet au chiens'' (''Huntsman and dogs''), many castings (see examples below), 1866&lt;ref&gt;Examples include:
* ''Huntsman and dogs'' at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney]], New South Wales, Australia, c.1879

* ''Hunter and hounds'' at [[Beverly Gardens Park]], Beverly Hills, California, USA, date unknown. Originally at [[Château-Thierry]], France. It was installed in Beverly Hills, USA in 1925 on [[Armistice Day]] to commemorate Mr. Longyear's, a local resident, son who was killed in the [[Battle of Château-Thierry (1918)]]. The inscribed plaque misspells Jacquemart's name and confuses his birth and death dates. The sculpture was later donated to the City of Beverly Hills and relocated to the park.
* ''Huntsman and dogs'' at the [[Elswout]] Estate, Overveen, Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Louis XII on horseback'', bas relief Hotel de Ville de Compiegne, 1869&lt;ref&gt;Benezit, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Soliman Pasha'', Cairo, 1874
* ''Mohammed Laz-oglou Bey'', Cairo, 1874-5
* ''Rhinocéros'', Paris, 1878&lt;ref&gt;Rhinocéros was commissioned for the 1878 [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Exposition Universelle]] and placed in the garden of the [[Palais du Trocadéro]]. When the Palais was demolished the sculpture was located c.1935 to 1985 at Porte de Saint-Cloud, Paris. In 1986 it was assigned to the Musee d'Orsay, Paris, restored and placed on display in the forecourt.

"'''Here be dragons'''" means dangerous or unexplored territories, in imitation of a medieval practice of putting illustrations of [[dragon]]s, [[Sea monster|sea-monster]]s and other mythological creatures on uncharted areas of maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-enchanting-sea-monsters-on-medieval-maps-1805646/ |title=The Enchanting Sea Monsters on Medieval Maps |last=Waters |first=Hannah |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |date=2013-10-15 |accessdate=2017-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Van Duzer |first1=Chet |title=Sea Monsters on Medieval and Renaissance Maps |publisher=British Library Publishing |year=2013 |isbn=978-0712357715 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although several early maps, such as the ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'', have illustrations of mythological creatures for decoration, the phrase itself is an [[anachronism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Erin C. | last = Blake | year = 1999 | title = Where Be "Here be Dragons"? | work = MapHist Discussion Group | publisher =  | url = http://www.maphist.nl/extra/herebedragons.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are just two known historical uses of this phrase in the [[Latin]] form "HC SVNT DRACONES"&lt;!-- sic; don't replace HC by HIC --&gt; (i.e. ''hic sunt dracones,'' 'here are dragons'). One is on the [[Hunt–Lenox Globe]]{{Ref|lenox_globe}} (c. 1503–07), on which the term appeared around the east coast of Asia. This might be related to the [[Komodo dragon]]s on the Indonesian islands, tales of which were quite common throughout East Asia.{{Ref|mccarthy}} The other appearance of the term is on a globe engraved on two conjoined halves of ostrich eggs, dated to 1504.&lt;ref name=Wapo/&gt; Earlier maps contain a variety of references to [[legendary creature|mythical]] and real creatures, but the Lenox Globe and the egg globe are the only known surviving maps to bear this phrase. Furthermore, the two maps may be closely linked: an investigation of the egg globe performed by collector Stefaan Missinne concluded that the Hunt–Lenox Globe is in fact a cast of it.
"'Here be dragons,' [is] a very interesting sentence," said Thomas Sander, editor of the ''Portolan'', the journal of the Washington Map Society. "In early maps, you would see images of sea monsters; it was a way to say there's bad stuff out there."&lt;ref name=Wapo&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Meeri|title=Oldest globe to depict the New World may have been discovered|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/oldest-globe-to-depict-the-new-world-may-have-been-discovered/2013/08/19/503b2b4a-06b4-11e3-a07f-49ddc7417125_story.html?hpid=z1|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical phrase used by ancient Roman and Medieval cartographers was ''HIC SVNT LEONES'' (literally, "here are [[lion]]s") when denoting unknown territories on maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Duzer|first=Chet|date=2014-06-04|title=Bring on the Monsters and Marvels: Non-Ptolemaic Legends on Manuscript Maps of Ptolemy’s Geography|url=http://www.brepolsonline.net/doi/10.1484/J.VIATOR.1.103923|journal=Viator|volume=45|issue=2|pages=303–334|doi=10.1484/J.VIATOR.1.103923|issn=0083-5897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dragons on maps ==
[[File:Psalter World Map, c.1265.jpg|thumb|The 1265 [[Psalter world map]]]]
Dragons appear on a few other historical maps:
* The [[T and O map|T-O]] [[Psalter world map]] ({{circa|1250}} AD) has dragons, as symbols of [[sin]], in a lower "frame" below the world, balancing [[Jesus]] and [[angel]]s on the top, but the dragons do not appear on the map proper.
* The [[Borgia map]] (c. 1430), in the Vatican Library, states, over a dragon-like figure in [[Asia]] (in the upper left quadrant of the map), "''Hic etiam homines magna cornua habentes longitudine quatuor pedum, et sunt etiam serpentes tante magnitudinis, ut unum bovem comedant integrum.''" ("Here there are even men who have large four-foot horns, and there are even serpents so large that they could eat an ox whole.").
* The [[Fra Mauro Map]] (c. 1450) has the "[[Island of Dragons]]" ({{lang-it|Isola de' dragoni}}), an imaginary island in the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Item 558 in: {{citation|title=Fra Mauro's World Map|authorlink=Piero Falchetta|first=Piero |last=Falchetta|publisher=Brepols |year=2006|isbn=2-503-51726-9|pages=294–295}}; also in [http://geoweb.venezia.sbn.it/cms/images/stories/Testi_HSL/FM_iscr.pdf the list online]&lt;/ref&gt;  In an inscription near [[Herat]], [[Fra Mauro]] says that in the mountains nearby "there are a number of dragons, in whose forehead is a stone that  cures many infirmities", and describes the locals' way of hunting those dragons to get the stones. This is thought to be based on [[Albertus Magnus]]'s treatise ''De mineralibus''.&lt;ref&gt;"In le montagne de la citade de [[Herat|here]] sono dragoni assai, i qual hano una piera in fronte virtuosa a molte infirmitade".  Item 1457 in {{harvnb|Falchetta|2006|pp=462–464}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an inscription elsewhere on the map, the cartographer expresses his skepticism regarding "serpents, dragons and [[basilisk]]s" mentioned by "some historiographers".&lt;ref&gt;Item 460 in {{harvnb|Falchetta|2006|pp=276–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 19th-century Japanese map, the ''[[:File:Jishinnoben1855.jpg|Jishin-no-ben]]'', in the shape of [[ouroboros]], depicts a dragon associated with causing earthquakes.

== Other creatures on maps ==
* [[Ptolemy]]'s atlas in ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' (originally 2nd century, taken up again in the 15th century) warns of [[elephant]]s, [[Hippopotamus|hippos]] and [[Cannibalism|cannibals]].
* ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]'' (medieval copy of Roman map) has "in his locis elephanti nascuntur", "in his locis scorpiones nascuntur" and "hic cenocephali nascuntur" ("in these places elephants are born, in these places [[scorpion]]s are born, here [[Cynocephaly|Cynocephali]] are born").
* [[Cotton MS. Tiberius]] B.V. fol. 58v (10th century), British Library Manuscript Collection, has "hic abundant leones" ("here lions abound"), along with a picture of a lion, near the east coast of Asia (at the top of the map towards the left); this map also has a text-only serpent reference in southernmost [[Africa]] (bottom left of the map): "Zugis regio ipsa est et Affrica. est enim fertilis. sed ulterior bestiis et serpentibus plena" ("This region of Zugis is in Africa; it is rather fertile, but on the other hand it is full of beasts and serpents.")
* The [[Ebstorf map]] (13th century) has a dragon in the extreme south-eastern part of Africa, together with an [[asp (reptile)|asp]] and a [[basilisk]].
* [[Giovanni Leardo]]'s map (1442) has, in southernmost Africa, "Dixerto dexabitado p. chaldo e p. serpent".
* [[Martin Waldseemüller]]'s Carta marina navigatoria (1516) has "an elephant-like creature in northernmost [[Norway]], accompanied by a legend explaining that this 'morsus' with two long and quadrangular teeth congregated there", i.e. a [[walrus]], which would have seemed monstrous at the time.
* Waldseemüller's Carta marina navigatoria (1522), revised by Laurentius Fries, has the morsus moved to the [[Davis Strait]].
* Bishop [[Olaus Magnus]]'s ''[[Carta Marina]]'' map of [[Scandinavia]] (1539) has many monsters in the northern sea, as well as a winged, bipedal, predatory land animal resembling a dragon in northern Lapland.
* On the maps surrounding [[imperialism]], up until the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885 and the discoveries made by [[David Livingstone|Livingstone]], elephants were drawn in as is shown by this excerpt from "On Poetry: a Rhapsody" by [[Jonathan Swift]]: "So geographers, in Afric maps, With savage pictures fill their gaps, And o'er uninhabitable downs, Place elephants for want of towns."

'''The Internet Symphony No. 1 - "Eroica"''', is a piece written by the Chinese composer [[Tan Dun]] for the [[YouTube Symphony Orchestra]]. It was the first of such events where musicians around the world play the same piece virtually via the internet, and the best performers selected were arranged into an internet symphony orchestra, featured on YouTube. In addition to submitting a performance of the Internet Symphony No.1 ("Eroica"), musicians were also allowed to submit a video of themselves playing one of the other selected pieces. The best performers were invited to play at New York City's [[Carnegie Hall]] on April 15, 2009, with all expenses paid by YouTube.  Winners were decided by the most number of votes cast by YouTube users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gbtimes.com/tan-duns-youtube-internet-symphony|title=Tan Dun's YouTube Internet Symphony|newspaper=gbtimes.com|access-date=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony was 4 minutes and 3 seconds long, the orchestra was commissioned by [[Google]]/[[YouTube]] and the work was published by [[G. Schirmer]] Inc.. It was performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] on October, 2008. Unconventionally, Tan Dun has included [[disc brakes]] and rims from automobiles as additional instruments. Tan also embedded a main theme from the first movement of [[Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|''Eroica'' Symphony]], into his work.

The [[Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra]], as a partner of the YouTube Symphony Orchestra Project, has created a Chinese orchestral version of Tan's Internet Symphony No.1, using the percussion instruments of the Beijing opera and ancient Chinese instruments like [[Bianzhong]] and [[guqin]]. It was rearranged by HKCO's Associate Conductor Chew Hee-Chiat, and conducted by Artistic Director and Principal Conductor Yan Huichang.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10622">'''Irrealism''' is a term that has been used by various writers in the fields of philosophy, literature, and art to denote specific modes of unreality and/or the problems in concretely defining reality.  While in philosophy the term specifically refers to a position put forward by the American philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]], in literature and art it refers to a variety of writers and movements.  If the term has nonetheless retained a certain consistency in its use across these fields and would-be movements, it perhaps reflects the word’s position in general English usage: though the standard dictionary definition of ''irreal'' gives it the same meaning as ''unreal'', ''irreal'' is very rarely used in comparison with ''unreal''.  Thus, it has generally been used to describe something which, while unreal, is so in a very specific or unusual fashion, usually one emphasizing not just the "not real," but some form of estrangement from our generally accepted sense of reality.

==Irrealism in Literature==

In literature, the term irrealism was first used extensively in the United States in the 1970s to describe the post-realist "new fiction" of writers such as [[Donald Barthelme]] or [[John Barth]].  More generally, it described the notion that all forms of writing could only "offer particular versions of reality rather than actual descriptions of it," and that a story need not offer a clear resolution at its end.  [[John Gardner (novelist)|John Gardner]], in ''The Art of Fiction'', cites in this context the work of Barthelme and its "seemingly limitless ability to manipulate [literary] techniques as modes of apprehension [which] apprehend nothing."&lt;ref&gt;(Gardner 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;   Though Barth, in a 1974 interview, stated, "irrealism—not antirealism or unrealism, but irrealism—is all that I would confidently predict is likely to characterize the prose fiction of the 1970s," &lt;ref&gt;(Bellamy 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; this did not prove to be the case.  Instead writing in the United States quickly returned to its realist orthodoxy and the term irrealism fell into disuse.

In recent years, however, the term has been revived in an attempt to describe and categorize, in literary and philosophical terms, how it is that the work of an irrealist writer differs from the work of writers in other, non-realistic genres (e.g., the fantasy of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], the magical realism of [[Gabriel García Márquez]]) and what the significance of this difference is.  This can be seen in Dean Swinford's essay ''Defining irrealism: scientific development and allegorical possibility''.[http://cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com/review1a.htm]  Approaching the issue from a structuralist and narratological point of view, he has defined irrealism as a "peculiar mode of postmodern allegory" that has resulted from modernity’s fragmentation and dismantling of the well-ordered and coherent medieval system of symbol and allegory.  Thus a lion, when presented in a given context in medieval literature, could only be interpreted in a single, approved way.  Contemporary literary theory, however, denies the attribution of such fixed meanings.  According to Swinford, this change can be attributed in part to the fact that "science and technical culture have changed perceptions of the natural world, have significantly changed the natural world itself, thereby altering the vocabulary of symbols applicable to [[epistemological]] and allegorical attempts to understand it."  Thus irreal works such as [[Italo Calvino]]'s ''Cosmicomics'' and [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' ''Ficciones'' can be seen as an attempt to find a new allegorical language to explain our changed perceptions of the world that have been brought about by our scientific and technical culture, especially concepts such as quantum physics or the theory of relativity.  "The Irrealist work, then, operates within a given system," writes Swinford, "and attests to its plausibility, despite the fact that this system, and the world it represents, is often a mutation, an aberration."

The online journal ''[[The Cafe Irreal]]'' [http://www.cafeirreal.com/], on the other hand, has defined irrealism as being a type of existentialist literature in which the means are continually and absurdly rebelling against the ends that we have determined for them.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, G.S. and Alice Whittenburg, "After Kafka: Kafka Criticism and Scholarship as a Resource in an Attempt to Promulgate a New Literary Genre," ''Journal of the Kafka Society of America'', 31/32(1+2):18-26.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this would be [[Franz Kafka]]'s story ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'', in which the salesman [[Gregor Samsa]]'s plans for supporting his family and rising up in rank by hard work and determination are suddenly thrown topsy-turvy by his sudden and inexplicable transformation into a man-sized insect.  Such fiction is said to emphasize the fact that human consciousness, being finite in nature, can never make complete sense of, or successfully order, a universe that is infinite in its aspects and possibilities.  Which is to say: as much as we might try to order our world with a certain set of norms and goals (which we consider our real world), the paradox of a finite consciousness in an infinite universe creates a zone of irreality ("that which is beyond the real") that offsets, opposes, or threatens the real world of the human subject.  Irrealist writing often highlights this irreality, and our strange fascination with it, by combining the unease we feel because the real world doesn't conform to our desires with the narrative quality of the dream state (where reality is constantly and inexplicably being undermined); it is thus said to communicate directly, "by feeling rather than articulation, the uncertainties inherent in human existence or, to put it another way... the irreconcilability between human aspiration and human reality." [http://cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com/what_is_irr.htm]  If the irreal story can be considered an allegory, then, it would be an allegory that is "so many pointers to an unknown meaning," in which the meaning is felt more than it is articulated or systematically analyzed.

==Irrealism in Art==

Various writers have addressed the question of Irrealism in Art.  Many salient observations on Irrealism in Art are found in Nelson Goodman's ''Languages of Art''.  Goodman himself produced some multimedia shows, one of which inspired by hockey and is entitled ''Hockey Seen: A Nightmare in Three Periods and Sudden Death''.

Garret [[Rowlan]], writing in ''[[The Cafe Irreal]]'', writes that the malaise present in the work of the Italian artist [[Giorgio de Chirico]], "which recalls Kafka, has to do with the sense of another world lurking, hovering like the long shadows that dominate de Chirico's paintings, which frequently depict a landscape at twilight's uncertain hour. Malaise and mystery are all by-products of the interaction of the real and the unreal, the rub and contact of two worlds caught on irrealism's shimmering surface." [http://cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com/review4a.htm]

The writer Dean Swinford, whose concept of irrealism was described at length in the section "Irrealism in Literature", wrote that the artist Remedios Varos, in her painting ''The Juggler'', "creates a personal allegorical system which relies on the predetermined symbols of Christian and classical iconography. But these are quickly refigured into a personal system informed by the scientific and organized like a machine...in the Irreal work, allegory operates according to an altered, but constant and orderly iconographic system."

Artist Tristan Tondino has made a number of claims about Irrealism.  Most of his claims are found in his paintings, many of which are [[Lettrist]] Abstractions. "There is no specific style to Irrealist Art.  It is the result of awareness that every human act is the result of the limitations of the world of the actor." &lt;ref&gt;Tondino 2003, ''Zot - Giving a Painter Crap...''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, the art journal ''the art life'' has recently detected the presence of a "New Irrealism" among the painters of that country, which is described as being an "approach to painting that is decidedly low key, deploying its effects without histrionic showmanship, while creating an eerie other world of ghostly images and abstract washes." What exactly constituted the "old" irrealism, they do not say.

== Irrealist Art, Film and Music Edition ==

Irrealist Art Edition is a publishing company created in the 90s by contemporary plastic artist [[Frédéric Iriarte]]. Together with the Estonian poet, writer and art critic [[Ilmar Laaban]], they developed their concept of Irrealism through several essays, exhibitions, projects, manifest and a book, "Irréalisation".

'''Jonty Hurwitz''' (born 2 September 1969 in Johannesburg) is an artist, [[engineer]] and entrepreneur.  Hurwitz creates scientifically inspired artworks and [[Anamorphosis|anamorphic]] sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/048913-007/tracks#details-description Tracks: Jonty Hurwitz], on [[Arte|ARTE]] 29 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He is recognised for the smallest human form ever created using [[nano technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/14/sculpture-human-sperm_n_6158258.html  |title=Artist Creates Sculptures So Tiny They Can't Be Seen By The Human Eye |publisher=Huffington Post, Leigh Weingus |date= 14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Jonty Hurwitz was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, to Selwin, a hotelier and entrepreneur and Marcia Berger, a drama lecturer and teacher. Jonty spent his early life living in small hotels in rural towns in South Africa while his father built up his business.

Jonty studied [[Electrical Engineering]] at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in [[Johannesburg]] from 1989 to 1993. His major was [[Signal Processing]]. He then joined the [[University of Cape Town]] Remote Sensing Group as a full-time researcher under Professor Michael Inggs, publishing a paper on radar pattern recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=365844 |title=Synthetic Range Profile Measurements of Aircraft, COMSIG-93, COMSIG ’93:204 – 209, September 1993. M R Inggs, J.B. Hurwitz, and A. Langman.  |publisher=COMSIG |date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his research post, Hurwitz traveled for a long period of time in India studying Yoga and wood carving.

==Career in art==
In a 2015, documentary by CNN International on Hurwitz's artwork,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/videos/tv/2015/03/13/spc-ones-to-watch-sculpture-c.cnn |title=Is this the World's Smallest Sculpture? |publisher=CNN |date= March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC Radio 2]] art critic Estelle Lovatt commented on Hurwitz's work: "If [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] were alive today, he would have been doing what Jonty is doing.  He would have been using algorithms.  No one else works like him today.  His art is the mix between the emotional and the intelligent, and that's what gives it that spark."&lt;ref name="Self2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mathematics of Self|title=Art of Jonty Hurwitz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=leATtAEACAAJ|date=8 January 2018|publisher=Blurb, Incorporated|isbn=978-1-389-03122-9|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurwitz's work focuses on the aesthetics of art in the context of human perception. His early body of sculpture was discovered by Estelle Lovatt during 2011 in an article for ''Art of England Magazine'': "Thinning the divide gap between art and science, Hurwitz is cognisant of the two being holistically co-joined in the same way as we are naturally, comfortably split between our spiritual and operational self".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static1.squarespace.com/static/541afcd4e4b09246971aad4b/t/5421b307e4b0004bfbd4f10e/1411494663328/ARTofEnglandJonty.pdf |title=Art of England, Estelle Lovatt, Feb 2011 publication, p50. |publisher=Art of England |date= Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pocketmags.com/viewmagazine.aspx?catid=1029&amp;category=Art+%26+Photography&amp;subcatid=183&amp;subcategory=Art&amp;title=Art+of+England&amp;titleid=1015&amp;issueid=31285 Art of England Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurwitz began producing sculptures in 2008. In 2009, his first sculpture '[[Yoda]] and the Anamorph' won the People’s Choice Bentliff Prize of the [[Maidstone Museum and Art Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent/news/winner-of-art-prize-announced-a105202/|title=Winner of Art Prize Announced. |publisher=Kent Online | date= 6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2009 he won the [[Bernard Noble|Noble]] Sculpture Prize&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnsf.org.uk/winners/2009/ |title=Bernard Noble Sculpture Prize. |date= Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was commissioned to install his first large scale work (a nude study of his father called 'Dietro di me')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jontyhurwitz.com/noble-prize ''Dietro di me''] by Jonty Hurwitz&lt;/ref&gt; in the Italian village [[Colletta di Castelbianco]]. In 2010, he was selected as a finalist for the 4th International [[Arte Laguna Prize]] in Venice, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premioartelaguna.it/catalogo/4edizione/catalogo_premio_arte_laguna_2009.pdf |title=Arte Laguna Exhibition Catalogue, p106. |publisher=Arte Laguna Prize |date= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Hurwitz's anamorphic work was described by the art blogger [[Colossal (blog)|Christopher Jobson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2013/01/the-skewed-anamorphic-sculptures-and-engineered-illusions-of-jonty-hurwitz/ |title=The skewed anamorphic sculptures and engineered illusions of Jonty Hurwitz |publisher=Christopher Jobson, Colossal |date= 21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a short documentary about Hurwitz's "Generation Pi" philosophy by ''Vera Productions'' it is estimated that the sculpture received 20 million views online in the space of a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTp5Q3-8Ng |title=The Paintbrush of Mathematics |publisher=Vera Productions |date= March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2013 Hurwitz was introduced to the [[Savoy Hotel]] by London art agent Sally Vaughan. Hurwitz was commissioned to be [[Artist in Residence]] at the hotel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artlyst.com/articles/londons-savoy-hotel-continues-its-artist-in-residence-tradition |title=London's Savoy Hotel continues its artist in residence tradition |publisher=Artlyst |date= April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and produce a sculpture of the hotel’s historically iconic [[Mascot]] ''Kaspar the Cat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/a-homage-to-kaspar-the-friendly-cat-checks-in-at-the-savoys-new-eatery-8600305.html |title=A homage to Kaspar the friendly Cat checks in at the Savoy's new eatery |publisher=The Independent |date= April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurwitz lived for several months in the hotel producing the sculpture.

In the same year, Hurwitz was also nominated for the [[Threadneedle Prize]] and exhibited a collection at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London. By late 2013, in a special edition of Art of England on portraiture, Hurwitz was cited as the #1 portrait artist in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketmags.com/viewmagazine.aspx?catid=1029&amp;category=Art+%26+Photography&amp;subcatid=183&amp;subcategory=Art&amp;title=Art+of+England&amp;titleid=1015&amp;issueid=60975 |title=Six of the Best, Sally Vaughan, Aug 2013. |publisher=Art of England |date= Aug 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014 Hurwitz was voted #46 in the top 100 artists of 2013 by the American art site, Empty Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emptykingdom.com/featured/empty-kingdom-top-100-artists-of-2013/ |title=Top 100 artists of 2013, Empty Kingdom. |publisher=Empty Kingdom |date= 31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, Hurwitz's anamorphic work was blogged as "The best of 2013" by the American Art and Culture magazine, [[Juxtapoz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juxtapoz.com/current/sculptures-by-jonty-hurwitz |title=Best of 2013: Sculpture by Jonty Hurwitz |publisher=Juxtapoz |date= 31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Hurwitz's work was also curated by ''Science Gallery International'' for a touring group show entitled ‘Illusion’ curated by [[Trinity College Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.sciencegallery.com/illusion/ Science Gallery International] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212190314/http://www.international.sciencegallery.com/illusion/ |date=12 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show presents a collection of installation artworks from around the world that affect human perception. The exhibition led to a 2014/2015 tour in the USA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/may/30/fleet-science-center-illusion-exhibit/ |title=Real fun at Fleet’s ‘Illusion’ exhibit |publisher=U-T San Diego, Karla Peterson |date= 30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it attracted over 170,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessandleadership.com/marketing/item/48935-science-gallery-dublin-hono |title=Science Gallery Dublin honoured with dedicated 68c stamp |publisher=Business &amp; Leadership Magazine |date=7 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110010448/http://www.businessandleadership.com/marketing/item/48935-science-gallery-dublin-hono |archivedate=10 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show then moved on to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 2015 and Leipzig, Germany in 2016.

In late 2014, he released a series of “nano sculptures” under the title of ″Trust″. This series of works captured the attentions of both the scientific and art community, being cited by among others, [[Nature (journal)|Nature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/images-of-the-month-november-2014-1.16481 |title=Image of the Month: November 2014 |publisher=Nature Journal, Daniel Cressey |date= 5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific American]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/2014/12/20/physics-week-in-review-december-20-2014/ |title=Physics Week in Review |publisher=Scientific American, Jennifer Ouellette  |date= 20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Popular Science]] and [[Phys.org]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2014-11-science-art-nanosculpture-marvels.html |title=When science and art produce nanosculpture marvels |publisher=Phys.org, Nancy Owano  |date= 18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Hurwitz was elected a member of the [[Royal British Society of Sculptors]]. In 2016 the [[Royal Photographic Society]] selected a [[Scanning Electron Microscope]] photograph by Hurwitz and Stefan Diller as one of the top 100 'Royal Society International Images for Science'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3777603/From-droplets-spider-web-spiral-galaxy-Stunning-photos-reveal-natural-beauty-science.html#ixzz4JfHIgjum |title=From droplets on a spider web to a spiral galaxy: Stunning photos reveal the natural beauty in science |publisher=Daily Mail, Libby Plumner  |date= 7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anamorphic sculpture===
Hurwitz has produced a body of work using both [[oblique projection|oblique]] (perspective) and [[catoptric]] (mirror) [[anamorphosis]]. In an interview with Christopher Jobson, Hurwitz explains his anamorphic inspiration as follows: “I have always been torn between art and physics. In a moment of self-doubt in 2008, I wandered into the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] and stumbled across a strange anamorphic piece by [[William Scrots]], a portrait of Edward VI from 1546. Followed shortly down the aisle by The Ambassadors by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] from 1533. My life changed forever. I rushed home and within hours was devouring the works of [[M. C. Escher]], [[Leonardo Da Vinci|Da Vinci]] and many more. In a breath I had found “brothers” in a smallish group of artists spanning 500 years with exactly the same dilemma as me. Within two months I was deep in production of my first work. My art rests on the shoulders of giants, and I am grateful to them.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twistedsifter.com/2013/04/anamorphic-sculptures-made-with-algorithms-jonty-hurwitz/  |title=Anamorphic Sculptures Made With Algorithms |publisher=Twisted Sifter |date= 17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anamorphosis]] as a form of art has a long history. A page in Leonardo Da Vinci’s note book (folio 35 verso a of the [[Codex Atlanticus]]) shows two strangely elongated sketches of a child's head and an eye. These distorted and hesitant drawings, the first known anamorphoses, from around 1485”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://startstudioarts.si.edu/2009/08/anamorphoses-in-the-eye-of-leonardo.html |title=Anamorphoses in the eyes of Leonardo |publisher=The Smithsonian, Holly Sloofman |date= 26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-18th Century anamorphosis was also used by [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] artists to secretly depict images of [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]] in the wake of brutal English censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.core77.com/blog/fine_art/how_to_hide_a_forbidden_image_in_plain_sight_anamorphic_cylinders_27356.asp |title=How to Hide a Forbidden Image in Plain Sight |publisher=Core77, Rain Noe |date= 22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurwitz is a pioneer in creating [[catoptric]] sculpture.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Until the creation of his first work ''Rejuvenation'', anamorphic sculptures have not been known to have existed in art history. In his online talks, Hurwitz explains that this is a function of processing power and that whilst painting is possible in a mirror, three dimensional anamorphosis could only have come into being with the advent of powerful computers. Each of his sculptures involves billions of calculations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ignant.de/2013/01/30/anamorphic-sculptures/ |title=Anamorphic Sculptures |publisher=Ignant |date= 13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; using an [[algorithm]] derived from the mathematical constant [[π]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.designboom.com/art/anamorphic-sculptures-by-jonty-hurwitz/ |title=Anamorphic sculptures by Jonty Hurwitz |publisher=Design Boom |date= 21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.urbanghostsmedia.com/2013/02/kiss-of-chytrid-anamorphic-art-jonty-hurwitz/ |title=Kiss of Chytrid: Anamorphic art by Jonty Hurwitz |publisher=Urban Ghost Media |date= 5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurwitz asserts that his art is “contemporary to the millisecond”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsfwyoutube.com/videos/398405/Jonty-Hurwitz-talk-Contemporary-Art-is-measured-in-milliseconds |title=Contemporary Art is Measured in Milliseconds |publisher=NSFW Youtube, Vera Productions, Jonty Hurwitz |date= March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kinetic Art]] curator and director of the London ''Kinetica Museum'', Dianne Harris, described Hurwitz's art as follows "The works of polymath Jonty Hurwitz are contemporary [[trompe l'oeil]], at first glance appearing abstract, but in mirrored reflections, representational".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinetica-artfair.com/?exhibitors/2013/jonty-hurwitz |title=Kinetica Museum Artist Profile, 2013.  |publisher=Kinetica |date= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nano sculpture===
In 2014, Hurwitz pioneered a new sculptural technique{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} in the field of [[Nanoart]] using [[multiphoton lithography]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cen.chempics.org/post/105392403108/trust-artist-jonty-hurwitz-and-nanoscientist |title=Trust |publisher=Chemical and Engineering News |date= 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[photogrammetry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://all3dp.com/enter-photo-studios-21st-century/?hvid=3766p |title=Enter the Photo Studios of the 21st Century |publisher=All3DP |date= 29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to create the world’s smallest human portraits of his first love. The works of art were inspired by the nineteenth century marble sculpture of Cupid and Psyche by [[Antonio Canova]], part of the permanent collection of the [[Louvre Museum]], Paris. Hurwitz’s works are so tiny that they are invisible to the human eye, able to be placed on the forehead of an ant. Smaller details of the works are at approximately the 300 [[nanometer]] scale, similar to the [[wavelengths]] of visible light and are therefore near impossible by the laws of physics to see in the visible spectrum.  The only way to observe these works is through a non-optical method of magnification like a [[scanning electron microscope]]. To create these works Hurwitz collaborated with a team of over 20 people, including Stephan Hengsbach of the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] and Yehiam Prior of the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], an art project centred in the world of academic [[physics]]. In February 2015, Hurwitz's sculpture "Trust" was awarded the world record for the "Smallest sculpture of a human" by the [[Guinness Book of Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/products/books/superlatives/smallest |title=Sculpture of a human 80 x 100 x 30 micrometers |publisher=Guinness World Records |date= 13 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Beautiful/Decay Hurwitz explains the philosophy behind the works: “As technology starts to evolve faster than our human perception is able to handle, the line between science and myth becomes blurred. We live in an era where the impossible has finally come to pass. In our own little way we have become demigods of creation in our physical world…. The nano works that I present to you here represent more that just a feat of science though. They represent the moment in history that we ourselves are able to create a full human form at the same scale as the sperm that creates us in order to facilitate the creation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beautifuldecay.com/2014/11/12/jonty-hurwitzs-sculptures-small-cant-seen-human-eye/ |title=Jonty Hurwitz’s sculptures are so small the can’t be seen with the human eye |publisher=Beautiful/Decay |date= 12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an online interview with [[Slashdot]], Hurwitz himself asks the question “How can something you can't see be art?”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech-beta.slashdot.org/story/14/12/15/1357213/interviews-ask-jonty-hurwitz-about-art-and-engineering |title=Ask Jonty Hurwitz about Art and Engineering |publisher=Slashdot |date= January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By basing his work on the myth of [[Cupid and Psyche]] he also suggests that our belief in modern science isn't that different from the faith the ancient greeks had in the [[demigod]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/elegant-nanosculptures-fit-comfortably-inside-the-eye-of-a-needle |title=Elegant Nano Sculptures Fit Comfortably Inside the Eye of a Needle |publisher=The Creators Project, Beckett Mufson  |date= 13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final irony was that the sculptures were destroyed by a touch one week before the images were published on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2836676/Is-smallest-sculpture-Nano-artist-creates-images-nude-model-easily-fit-eye-needle.html |title=Artist spends ten months creating sculptures which are half the width of a human hair... only for his friend to accidentally crush them a few minutes later |publisher=Daily Mail, Stephanie Linning  |date= December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in technology==
In the mid-90s, Hurwitz arrived in London following his travels in India and got his first job researching financial [[data visualization]] for [[Gilbert de Botton]], Chairman and Founder of [[GAM (company)|Global Asset Management]] (GAM). During this period, he was exposed to de Botton’s [[open architecture]] model of asset management. It was Jonty’s close relationship with de Botton, also a major British art collector, that exposed him to the art world. The two maintained a close friendship until de Botton's death in 2000.

Hurwitz left Global Asset Management after two years forming his own company, ''Delve'', to develop the [[Research and Development|R&amp;D]] in [[data visualisation]] and reporting. Jonty’s main client became de Botton himself. In 1996, GAM launched its financial reporting technology built by Hurwitz, which attracted attention in the financial media, winning several awards.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Hurwitz’s newly formed graphics and software team evolved over several years publishing several visualization projects (non-exhaustive list):

*1997 News International visual archives on the [[Cold War]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]], Published by News International
*1998 [[Biosys]] an environmental simulation published by ''Take 2 Interactive''. 
*1998 Hurwitz was selected by the British Foreign Office to build a 3D engine called “Oceans of Innovation” to represent the leading edge of British Innovation.  The work was nominated for a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/189832.stm | title=Bafta plugs into interactive awards. | publisher=BBC |date= 9 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years from 2000 to 2005, Hurwitz signed up a large base of asset managers for his reporting and analysis technology. In 2005, Hurwitz’s company ''Delve'' was acquired by [[Alternative Investment Market]] listed company Statpro Group PLC (SOG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/rns/050704sog4008o |title=Acquisition of Delve, a leading supplier of enterprise and web reporting. |publisher=Proactive Investors |date= 4 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurwitz joined Statpro as [[Creative Director]] where he designed the first [[cloud-based|Cloud Computing]] analytics and [[risk]] platform for asset data. In 2008, Statpro launched its flagship product ''Statpro Revolution'' which was the result of this R&amp;D. By 2014, eight out of the top ten largest asset managers in the world were Statpro Clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statpro.com/news/eight-top-ten-largest-asset-managers-world-statpro-clients/ |title=Eight out of the top ten largest asset managers in the world Statpro Clients. |publisher=Statpro |date= 20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurwitz was co-founding Chief Technology Officer of [[Wonga.com]] in 2007 where he designed and built the first real-time online consumer loan system in the world.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} During this period, Wonga’s technology won several awards (listed below). By 2011, Wonga had begun to attract criticism and Hurwitz, as the inventor of the technology, found himself with not enough influence to guide the now large company's use of his designs. After several attempts at changing Wonga's strategy, he resigned from his operational role in November 2011, quietly releasing his sculpture entitled ''Co-Founder''.

Hurwitz's technology is credited with several innovations in the financial services industry:
*Financial sliders. A [[User Interface]] innovation which allowed customers to easily to get a real-time quote on the exact cost of a loan in pound and pennies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/oct/16/wonga-algorithm-lending-debt-data |title=Your prosperity could depend on an Algorithm |publisher=Will Sawney,Guardian |date= 16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of communicating loan information to consumers has been adopted by several of the major high street UK lenders. These include (non-exhaustive list): [[HSBC]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], [[Barclays]], [[Halifax (bank)|Halifax]], [[Lloyd's of London|Lloyds]], [[Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company|Nationwide]], [[Santander Bank]], [[The Co-operative Bank|Co-operative Bank]], [[Natwest]] and [[Bank of Scotland]].
*Real-time risk technology. Wonga’s risk engine was the first ever to evaluate the credit worthiness of a customer in near real time on the internet based on the collection of data from alternative sources in combination with traditional credit scores.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The consumer risk technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2011/03/15/the-algorithm-that-beats-your-bank-manager/ |title=The algorithm that beats your bank manager |publisher=Parmy Olson, Forbes |date= 15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided the ability to transfer money to customers within 12 minutes on the basis of the decision.

Hurwitz continues to commit much of his time to [[Financial technology|fintech]] startups while at the same time building up his body of artwork. In late 2011 Hurwitz backed Damian Kimmelman, to build a next-generation data provider [[Duedil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.growthbusiness.co.uk/news-and-market-deals/fundraising-deals/1679298/duedil-secures-funding-from-wongas-jonty-hurwitz.thtml |title=Duedil secures funding from Jonty Hurwitz |publisher=Growth Business, Thomas Hobbs |date= 14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duedil has since been dubbed "The Bloomberg of private companies" and has emerged as one of the key data providers in Europe and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cd830afa-8364-11e3-86c9-00144feab7de.html#axzz3QWzwSOhb |title=UK startup dubbed 'Bloomberg of private companies' raises $17m  |publisher=Financial Times, Jonathan Moules |date= 3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Hurwitz [[seed money|seed funded]] the financial technology startup ''behalf.com''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/challenged-by-upstarts-lenders-try-new-strategy-cooperation/?_r=1&amp;action=Click&amp;contentCollection=Investment%20Banking&amp;module=BlogPost-Title&amp;pgtype=Blogs&amp;region=Body&amp;version=Blog%20Main |title= Challenged by Upstarts, Lenders try a New Strategy: Cooperation  |publisher=New York Times, Randall Smith |date= 7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Hurwitz backed the UK startup bank for young people: ''Meet Osper''.

[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Knight, Death and Devil (NGA 1943.3.3519).jpg|thumb|320px|''Knight, Death and the Devil'', 1513, [[engraving]], 24.5 x 19.1 cm]]

'''''Knight, Death and the Devil''''' ({{lang-de|Ritter, Tod und Teufel}}) is a large 1513 [[engraving]] by the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]], one of the three ''Meisterstiche'' (master prints)&lt;ref&gt;Along with ''[[Saint Jerome in His Study (Dürer)|St. Jerome in his Study]]'' and ''[[Melencolia I]]'', both 1514&lt;/ref&gt; completed during a period when he almost ceased to work in paint or woodcuts to focus on engravings. The image is infused with complex iconography and symbolism, the precise meaning of which has been argued over for centuries.

An armoured knight, accompanied by his dog, rides through a narrow gorge flanked by a goat-headed devil and the [[Death (personification)|figure of death]] riding a [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse#Pale Horse|pale horse]]. Death's rotting corpse holds an [[hourglass]], a reminder of the shortness of life. The rider moves through the scene looking away from the creatures lurking around him, and appears almost contemptuous of the threats, and is thus often seen as symbol of courage;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, 15&lt;/ref&gt; the knight's armor, the horse which towers in size over the beasts, the oak leaves and the fortress on the mountaintop are symbolic of the resilience of faith, while the knight's plight may represent Christians' earthly journey towards the [[Kingship and kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://museum.cornell.edu/exhibitions/albrecht-d%C3%BCrer-master-prints Albrecht Dürer: The Master Prints]". Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, Cornell University. Retrieved 20 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was mentioned by [[Giorgio Vasari]] as one of "several sheets of such excellence that nothing finer can be achieved".&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, J. "The Renaissance in the North". New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1987. 99&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely copied and had a large influence on later German writers. Philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] referenced the work in his work on dramatic theory ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872) to exemplify pessimism, while it was later idealised in the 20th century by the [[Nazis]] as representing the racially pure [[Aryan]], and was sometimes used in their propaganda imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Ashley.

==Composition==
[[File:Detalhe gravura Dürer 2.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Detail]]

As with the two other of his ''Meisterstiche'', it contains a skull, dog, and hourglass, while all three are identical in size. The engraving is heavily indebted to the [[Gothic art|Gothic]] style. Many of the forms blend into each other. The outline of the horse is built from a series of interlocking curves, while the knight's chin is woven into the line of his helmet. These two central figures are surrounded by a tangled mass of branches, harness and hair, which according to art historian Raymond Stites contrast with the relatively solid figure of the knight and his horse to set them as a "tangible idea in a world of changing forms".&lt;ref name="S465"&gt;Stites, 465&lt;/ref&gt; The man is shown looking doggedly straight ahead, he does not allow his line of vision be interrupted or distracted by the demons beside him.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Daniel. "Epilogue". ''Journal of Psychoanalytic Inquiry'', Volume 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Elizabeth Lunday the "skeletal figure of death stands ghostly pale against the darkness of a shadowy crag, while the devil, a multihorned  goatlike creature, skulks amongst straggly tree roots."&lt;ref&gt;Lunday, Elizabeth. "Secret Lives of Great Artists". Quirk Books, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Death is shown with his horse in the left background and rendered without nose or lips in lighter shades than the other figures.&lt;ref name="S465" /&gt; A skull is seen in the lower foreground, directly in the Knight's path, whilst a dog is running between the two horses.

Death, the Devil, and the landscape are all rendered in a bleakly [[Northern Renaissance|northern]] manner. The surrounding characters are threatening to the knight, who is seemingly protected by the literal and figurative [[Armor of God|armor of his faith]]. It is believed by some art historians to be linked with publications of the Dutch humanist and theologian [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus's]] ''[[Enchiridion militis Christiani]]'' (''Handbook of a Christian soldier'').&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/43.106.2 Knight, Death, and the Devil, 1513–14]". [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]]. Retrieved June 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The engraving draws from [[Psalm 23]]; "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil".&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/a/albrecht_d%C3%BCrer,_knight,_death.aspx |title=Albrecht Dürer, Knight, Death and the Devil, a copperplate engraving |publisher=[[British Museum]] |access-date=June 12, 2010 |archive-date=November 8, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108062023/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/a/albrecht_d%C3%BCrer%2C_knight%2C_death.aspx |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Knight, Death and the Devil'' is dated and signed by the artist; the bottom left of the tablet is scribed "S. (=Salus/in the year of grace) 1513."&lt;ref name="Dublin"/&gt; In contrast, American artist [[Ursula Meyer]] believed that the knight displayed in this print is not a Christian knight at all, but a "robber knight" (''raubritter''). She believes that the iconography of the fox tail symbolises the greed of the knight, and that Death and the Devil are merely the knight's companions on his journey, not omens.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, 27–41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
[[File:Duerer - Ritter zu Pferde.jpg|180px|thumb|''Knight on horse'', a study from c.1512–13.]]
[[File:Duerer - Studie Reiter 1495.jpg|180px|thumb|Albrecht Dürer, ''Study of a rider'', 1498]]
The work was created while Dürer was in the service of the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian]] but was not a commission and does not contain an overtly political message. Instead it reaches back to a medieval sense of morality, and is replete with Gothic imagery.&lt;ref name="S465"&gt;Stites, 465&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Getlein &amp; Getlein, 68&lt;/ref&gt; The engraving bears similarities in mood and tone to one of Dürer's other great prints ''[[Melencolia I]]''. The knight seems resigned, and his facial features are downcast. His gloomy posture is in contrast to the sturdy look of his horse. While his armor may protect him against the surrounding demons, the skull on a stump is held in front of the horse and the fall of the sand held by death in the face of the knight. According to writer Dorothy Getlein, "there is a sense of obsolescence about the knight accompanied by Death and the Devil."&lt;ref&gt;Getlein &amp; Getlein, 72&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' art critic [[Holland Cotter]] noted that the composition followed soon after Dürer's beloved mother died a painful death.&lt;ref&gt;Holland Cotter, "The Renaissance Followed Him North", ''The New York Times'', March 22, 2013, [https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9C06E5DE163AF931A15750C0A9659D8B63.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian 19th-century art historian [[Moritz Thausing]] suggested that Dürer had created ''Knight, Death and the Devil'' as part of a four-work cycle, each designed to illustrate one of the [[four temperaments]]. According to Thausing, the work was intended to represent [[Four Temperaments#Sanguine|sanguinity]], hence the "S" engraved in the work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zo4sAAAAMAAJ Masters in art: a series of illustrated monographs, Volume 5]. Bates and Guild Co., 1904. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally believed that the portrayal is a literal, though pointed, celebration of the knight's Christian faith, and also of the ideals of [[humanism]]. An alternative interpretation was presented in 1970 by writer Sten Karling, who suggested that the work did not seek to glorify the knight, but instead depict a "robber Baron". Karling points to the lack of Christian or religious symbolism in the work and to the fox's tail wrapped on top the knight's lance – in Greek legend&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Physiologus]] text; see Nürnberg, 74&lt;/ref&gt; the fox's tail was a symbol of greed, cunning and treachery, as well as [[lust]] and [[whoring]].&lt;ref name="Dublin"&gt;Nürnberg, 74&lt;/ref&gt; However, knights were commonly depicted in contemporary art with a fox tail tied to the tip of their lance. Moreover, the fox tail was a common form of protective [[amulet]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lLBlor8nIu0C&amp;pg=PA10 The Landsknechts], Douglas Miller, 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is considered one among three of Dürer's "Meisterstiche" (''master prints''); along with [[Saint Jerome in His Study (Dürer)|''Saint Jerome in His Study'']] (1514) and ''[[Melencolia I]]'' (1514).&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt; In particular, the horse is skillfully rendered in geometric shapes that call to mind [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and reflect the [[Renaissance]] interest in natural sciences and anatomy.&lt;ref name="Dublin" /&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Martin Luther as an Augustinian Monk.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Posthumous portrait of [[Martin Luther]] as an [[Order of St. Augustine|Augustinian]] friar]]
In 1870 [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] gave a print of the engraving to [[Richard Wagner]]. The work was significant to Nietzsche as a representation of a "brave future" and as such he gave a copy to his [[Elisabeth Nietzsche|sister]] on the eve of her emigration to [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref&gt;Bertram, 39&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[First World War]], writers [[Thomas Mann]] and [[Ernst Bertram]] described the work as close to what Nietzsche could teach about the fate of Germany; the embodiment of the [[Renaissance]] and the teachings of [[Martin Luther]], and as described by Gary Shapiro, they believed it was "invoked in order to intensify the sense of resolute determination in the absence of all hope."&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, 118&lt;/ref&gt; Although Durer did not meet Luther, his writings indicate that he admired him highly, and the engraving may well have been intended as a tribute to him.&lt;ref name="met"&gt;Snyder, James (ed).

Dürer was idealised from the 1920s by ideologues within the [[Nazi]] party as "the most German of German artists". At a 1927 Nazi rally the philosopher, Nazi theorist and ideologue, and later convicted war criminal [[Alfred Rosenberg]] compared the assembled [[stormtrooper]]s to the warrior in ''Knight, Death and the Devil'', exclaiming that "in everything that you do, remember that for the National Socialists only one thing counts: to cry out to the world: And even if the world is full of devils, we must win anyway!"&lt;ref&gt;Brockmann, Stephen. ''Nuremberg: The Imaginary Capital''. London: Camden House, 2006. 144. {{ISBN|978-1-5711-3345-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, the mayor of [[Nuremberg]] presented [[Hitler]] with an original print of ''Knight, Death and the Devil'',&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, 42-44&lt;/ref&gt; and described Hitler as the "knight without fear or blame, who as the [[Führer]] of the new German [[Reich]], once again carried and multiplied the fame of the old imperial city of Nuremberg to the whole world."&lt;ref&gt;Brockmann, 145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other writers===
Argentine writer and poet [[Jorge Luis Borges]] wrote two poems based on the engraving, titled "Ritter, Tod, und Teufel" (I) and "Ritter, Tod und Teufel" (II). In the first he praises the knight's [[courage]], writing, "Being / brave, [[Teuton]], you surely will be / worthy of the Devil and Death."&lt;ref&gt;Borges, 98&lt;/ref&gt; In the second he compares his own state to the knight, writing, "It's me and not the Knight that the old, white-faced man, head crowned with writhing snakes, exhorts."&lt;ref&gt;Borges, 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[print room]]s with a significant collection will have a copy, and there are many, often late and worn, impressions in private collections.

'''Lebor na hUidre''' {{IPA-ga|ˈl͈ʲevor nˠə huiðʲrʲə|}} or the '''Book of the Dun Cow''' (MS 23 E 25) is an Irish [[vellum]] [[manuscript]] dating to the 12th century. It is the oldest extant manuscript in [[Irish language|Irish]]. It is held in the [[Royal Irish Academy]] and is badly damaged: only 67 leaves remain and many of the texts are incomplete. It is named after an anachronistic legend that it was made from the hide of a [[dun cow]] by Saint [[Ciarán of Clonmacnoise]].

==History==
The manuscript is thought to be the work of three scribes, whose handwriting was distinguished by [[Richard Irvine Best]] in 1912 and identified with the letters ''A'', ''M'' and ''H''.&lt;ref&gt;R. I. Best, "Notes on the Script of ''Lebor na hUidre''", ''[[Ériu (journal)|Ériu]]'' 6, 1912, pp. 161–174&lt;/ref&gt; A and M are believed to be contemporary. A began the manuscript and wrote the opening pages of several of the texts, which were continued by M, who Best identified as [[Máel Muire mac Céilechair]] meic Cuinn na mBocht, based on matching the handwriting with two marginal ''[[probatio pennae|probationes pennae]]'' or pen tests, in which the scribe wrote his name. A much later note elsewhere in the manuscript names Máel Muire as the person who "wrote and compiled this book from divers[e] books". His murder by Vikings at [[Clonmacnoise]] is recorded in the ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]'' in 1106,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]'' [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100005B/text021.html M1106.7]&lt;/ref&gt; giving us a latest possible date and location for the main body of the manuscript. Some time later, ''H'' (named for his addition of two homilies) added a number of new texts and passages, sometimes over [[palimpsest|erased portions]] of the original, sometimes on new leaves. Based on [[orthography]] and an English [[loanword]], [[Gearóid Mac Eoin]] concludes that H wrote in the late 12th or early 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gearóid Mac Eoin, "The Interpolator H in ''Lebor na hUidre''", ''Ulidia'', December Publications, 1994, pp. 39–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the monastery of Clonmacnoise was broken up, the manuscript came into the possession of the [[O'Donnell dynasty]] of [[County Donegal|Donegal]] who held it until 1359, when it and the lost ''Leabhar Gearr'' were used to ransom members of the clan who had been taken prisoner by Cathal Óg [[Ó Conchobhair Sligigh]] (d. 3 November 1362). Áed Ruad O'Donnell recovered the manuscript in 1470, and it remained in Donegal at least until 1631, when the compilation of the ''Annals of the Four Masters'' was completed. Its location is unknown until 1837, when it was part of a collection owned by Messrs. Hodges &amp; Smith of [[College Green]], Dublin, and was cited by [[George Petrie (artist)|George Petrie]] in an essay on the History and Antiquities of Tara Hill. The Hodges &amp; Smith collection, 227 manuscripts in all, was purchased by the Royal Irish Academy in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;R. I Best and Osborn Bergin (eds.), ''Lebor na hUidre'', Royal Irish Academy, 1929, p. ix; ''[http://www.ria.ie/library+catalogue/leabharnahuidre.html Lebor na hUidre]'', Royal Irish Academy Library and Catalogue&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph O'Longan's [[lithography|lithographic]] facsimile of the manuscript was published by the RIA in 1870.&lt;ref name="eds"&gt;{{citation| url  =https://celt.ucc.ie//published/G301900/index.html | title = Lebor na hUidre [G301900] | work = CELT | at = Background details and bibliographic information | }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[diplomatic edition]] by R. I. Best and [[Osborn Bergin]] {{harv|Best|Bergin|1929}}, with the three hands distinguished by different typefaces, was published in 1929.&lt;ref name="eds"/&gt; Digital scans of the pages at the [[Royal Irish Academy]] have been published on the web by ISOS (Irish Script on Screen).{{harv|ISOS|MS 23 E 25}}

'''Modena Cathedral''' ({{lang-it|Cattedrale Metropolitana di Santa Maria Assunta e San Geminiano}} but colloquially known as simply ''Duomo di Modena'') is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[cathedral]] in [[Modena]], [[Italy]], dedicated to the [[Assumption of the Virgin Mary]] and [[Saint Geminianus]]. Formerly the seat of the Diocese, later Archdiocese, of Modena, it has been since 1986 the archiepiscopal seat of the [[Archdiocese of Modena-Nonantola]]. Consecrated in 1184, it is an important [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] building in Europe and a [[World Heritage Site]].

==History==
Since the [[5th century]], two churches had existed on the site of the present cathedral: the discovery of the burial site of [[Saint Geminianus]], Modena's patron saint, led to the destruction of those churches and building of this cathedral by 1099. The initial design and direction was provided by an architect known as [[Lanfranco]], little else is known about this architect. The Saint's remains are still exhibited in the cathedral's [[crypt]]. The present cathedral was consecrated by [[Pope Lucius III]] on July 12, 1184.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/39175 San Geminiano di Modena&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embellishment==
[[File:Modena Cathedral outside.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Inscription on the apse.]]
After Lanfranco's work, the Cathedral was embellished by [[Anselmo da Campione]] and his heirs, the so-called "Campionese-masters". The current façade therefore exhibits different styles. The majestic rose-window was added by Anselmo in the 13th century, while the two [[lion]]s supporting the entrance's columns are of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] age, probably discovered while digging the foundations.

==Façade==

The façade has also notable [[relief]]s by [[Wiligelmus]], a contemporary of Lanfranco's; these include portraits of [[prophet]]s and [[patriarch]]s, and most of all the ''Biblical Stories'', a masterpiece of Romanesque sculpture. The scholars have pointed out the splendid achievements in the creation of [[Adam and Eve]], the original sin and the story of [[Noah]].

The side gates are also noteworthy. On Piazza Grande, the ''Porta Regia'' ("Royal Gate"), also by the campionesi, and the shorter ''Porta dei Principi'' ("Princes' Gate"), decorated with a relief depicting episodes of the life of Saint Geminianus, by a pupil of Wiligelmus'. On the northern side is the ''Porta della Pescheria'' ("Fish-Market Gate"), with reliefs inspired by the cycle of the years' twelve [[month]]s (on the doorposts) and tales from the [[Breton language|Breton]] Cycle of [[King Arthur]] (on the arch).

==Interiors==
[[File:Modena Cathedral inside.jpg|thumb|left|upright]]
The interior is divided into three [[nave]]s. Between the central nave and the crypt is a marble parapet by Anselmo da Campione portraying the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]], including the [[Last Supper]]. The [[pulpit]] is by [[Arrigo da Campione]], decorated with small [[terracotta]] statues. Notable also the wood crucifix from the 14th century.

The Duomo houses also the [[nativity scene]]s by two great Modenese artistis: [[Antonio Begarelli]]'s one (1527) and, in the crypt, [[Guido Mazzoni (sculptor)|Guido Mazzoni]]'s one (1480), also known as the ''Madonna della Pappa'' ("Madonna of the Pap").

The [[Torre della Ghirlandina]] is annexed to the church.

The funeral of the late famed tenor [[Luciano Pavarotti]], a native of Modena, was held in the cathedral.

==Porta della Pescheria==

The cathedral's north portal, known as the Porta della Pescheria, features [[high relief]] carvings of secular scenes on the marble [[archivolt]] and [[lintel]]. The carvings on the archivolt are notable for depicting a very early [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] scene.&lt;ref name="NAE"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Stokstad  | first = Marilyn  | author-link =   | contribution = Modena Archivolt  | editor-last = Lacy  | editor-first = Norris J.  | title = The New Arthurian Encyclopedia  | volume =   | pages = 324–326  | publisher = Garland  | place = New York  | year = 1991  | contribution-url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Modena Cathedral outside (4).jpg|thumb|left|Upper part of the Porta della Pescheria.]]
The lintel carvings include a [[cross]], birds, animals, and a man riding a [[hippocamp]]. The archivolt carving, dubbed the "Modena Archivolt" in Arthurian circles, includes inscriptions identifying the figures as Arthurian characters and sets them in a scene which has various correspondences in Arthurian literature. It is possibly the earliest [[monumental sculpture]] to feature the Arthurian legend. The sculptor has been dubbed the "Arthur Master", and critics note that while his inspiration outshines his skill he faithfully captures realistic details in architecture and dress. The date of the piece and the artist's source have been debated vigorously. [[Roger Sherman Loomis]] argued for a date at the beginning of the 12th century, which would place the carving decades earlier than the earliest written Arthurian romances on the continent. However, other evidence points to a date no earlier than 1120, and the later work of Jacques Stiennon and Rita Lejeune suggests a date between 1120 and 1140.&lt;ref name="NAE"/&gt;

At the center of the Modena Archivolt image is a castle defended by two towers, inside of which are two figures identified as "Mardoc" and "Winlogee". The left tower is defended by a pickaxe-wielding man named "Burmaltus", who faces off against [[King Arthur|Artus de Bretania]] (King Arthur), Isdernus (most likely [[Yder]]), and another unnamed knight, who all bear their lances against him. On the other side, the knight "Carrado" spars with "Galvagin" (likely [[Gawain]]), while "Che" ([[Sir Kay|Kay]]) and "Galvariun" (perhaps Galeshin) approach with their lances at their shoulders.&lt;ref name="NAE"/&gt;

"Winlogee" most likely corresponds to Arthur's wife, [[Guinevere]].&lt;ref name="NAE"/&gt; Loomis suggested the names derived from [[Breton language|Breton]]; "Winlogee" is similar to the Breton name Wenlowen, and Guinevere's name is rendered as the related ''Gwendoloena'' in the Latin romance ''[[De Ortu Waluuanii]]''. The [[Guinevere#Abduction of Guinevere|Abduction of Guinevere]] is a very popular and ancient element of the Arthurian legend, first appearing in written form in [[Caradoc of Llancarfan]]'s mid-12th-century ''[[Gildas#Life|Life of Gildas]]''. This version describes Arthur's queen as being kidnapped by King [[Melwas]] of the Summer Country and taken to [[Glastonbury]]; Arthur only recovers her with the help of Saint [[Gildas]]. Later versions call the kidnapper [[Meleagant]] and name the queen's lover [[Lancelot]], rather than Arthur himself, as her rescuer. Interesting in the context of the Modena Archivolt is the shadowy early tradition in which the character known as Yder, Ider, or some variant was the queen's lover and rescuer. This tradition is mostly lost but is mentioned in [[Thomas of Britain]]'s ''[[Tristan]]'' and survives, in greatly manipulated form, in other romances, the most important of which is ''Yder''. One such romance, ''Durmart le Galois'', includes a scene in which ''Ydier'' participates in a rescue of Guinevere, and rides unarmed, as Isdernus does on the Modena Archivolt.

The knight Galvagin, the only one with a decorated shield, likely corresponds to Gawain, the hero of many romances. Gawain fights with a knight named Carados of the Dolorous Tower in the [[Lancelot-Grail|Vulgate Cycle]] (Lancelot-Grail) and [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', based on the Vulgate. Further correspondences with material in the Vulgate also occur: notably, the Vulgate includes a scene in which Arthur, his nephew Galeshin, and his seneshal Kay attack Carados of the Dolorous Tower; the names of Arthur's companions are similar to the "Che" and "Galvariun" who approach Gawain on the Modena Archivolt. Loomis argued that the Archivolt scene corresponds to the Vulgate version of Guinevere's abduction, and that in an early version Gawain may have been the rescuer rather than Lancelot. Others have argued that the Modena image depicts the lost romance of Yder, or else the early stock version in which Arthur himself was the rescuer. Some others have argued that the image is not of Arthurian origin at all, though this is minority opinion.&lt;ref name="NAE"/&gt;

'''muf''' is a [[Artist cooperative|collaborative of artists]], [[architect]]s and [[urban design]]ers based in [[London]], [[England]], specialising in the design of the urban public realm to facilitate appropriation by users.

==History==
muf were formed in 1994 when they were loaned office space for 6-months in Great Sutton Street, London. They were committed to working in the public realm, at the same time critiqueing the private realm (where 'care' and 'feeling' had been confined). muf were strong supporters of flexible working practices, which allowed childcare responsibilities and external teaching commitments to continue.&lt;ref name="Altering Practices"&gt;Doina Petrescu, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_sUaI0mM-J4C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=muf+architects&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ryAzT5yoBoqi0QWhtvCXBw&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=muf%20architects&amp;f=false ''Altering practices: feminist politics and poetics of space''], Routledge (2007), pp. 57-68. {{ISBN|978-0-415-35785-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 muf consisted of two architects, Juliet Bidgood and [[Liza Fior]] and an artist, Katharine Clarke, in regular collaboration with urban theorist, Katharine Shonfield.&lt;ref name="Altering Practices" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="66270">{{Politics}}
The connection between '''music and politics''', particularly political expression in song, has been seen in many cultures. Although music influences political movements and rituals, it is not clear how or to what extent general audiences relate to music on a political level.&lt;ref name="Polpop"/&gt; Music can express [[anti-establishment]] or protest themes, including [[anti-war song]]s, but pro-establishment ideas are also represented, for example, in national anthems, patriotic songs, and political campaigns. Many of these types of songs could be described as [[topical song]]s.

Songs can be used to portray a specific political message. However, there may be barriers to the transmission of such messages; even overtly political songs are often shaped by and reference their contemporary political context, making an understanding of the history and events that inspired the music necessary in order to fully comprehend the message. The nature of that message can also be ambiguous because the label "political music" can be applied either to songs that merely observe political subjects, songs which offer a partisan opinion, or songs which go further and advocate for specific political action. Thus a distinction has been made, for example, between the use of music as a tool for raising awareness, and music as advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140714161257/http://livingearth.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/CASE-STUDY-OF-MUSIC-AS-A-TOOL-FOR-ADVOCACY-AND-AWARENESS-RAISING.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, some forms of music may be deemed political by cultural association, irrespective of political content, as evidenced by the way [[Western culture|Western]] pop/rock bands such as [[The Beatles]] were censored by the [[State (polity)|State]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]] in the 1960s and 1970s, while being embraced by younger people as symbolic of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neweasterneurope.eu/columns-blogs/new-voices/855-back-in-the-ussr |title=New Eastern Europe |website=Neweasterneurope.eu |date=2012-11-29 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This points to the possibilities for discrepancy between the political intentions of musicians (if any), and reception of their music by wider society. Conversely, there is the possibility of the meaning of deliberate political content being missed by its intended audience,  reasons for which could include obscurity or delivery of message, or audience indifference or antipathy.

It is difficult to predict how audiences will respond to political music, in terms of aural or even visual cues.&lt;ref name="Polpop"/&gt; For example, Bleich and Zillmann found that "counter to expectations, highly rebellious students did not enjoy defiant rock videos more than did their less rebellious peers, nor did they consume more defiant rock music than did their peers",&lt;ref name="Polpop"&gt;{{cite web|last=alio|first=nur|title=Political Pop, Political Fans?|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/mp/9460447.0004.103?view=text;rgn=main|publisher=Music &amp; Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting there may be little connection between behaviour and musical taste. Pedelty and Keefe argue that "It is not clear to what extent the political messages in and around music motivate fans, become a catalyst for discussion, [or] function aesthetically".

However, in contrast they cite research that concludes, based on interpretive readings of lyrics and performances with a strong emphasis on historical contexts and links to social groups, that "given the right historical circumstances, cultural conditions, and aesthetic qualities, popular music can help bring people together to form effective political communities".&lt;ref name="Polpop"/&gt;

Recent research has also suggested that in many schools around the world, including in modern democratic nations, [[music education]] has sometimes been used for the ideological purpose of instilling [[patriotism]] in children, and that particularly during wartime patriotic singing can escalate to inspire destructive [[jingoism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David and Kertz-Welzel, Alexandra (2012).''Patriotism and Nationalism in Music Education''. Aldershot, UK: Ashgate Press {{ISBN|1409430804}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Plato wrote: "musical innovation is full of danger to the whole state, and ought to be prohibited. When modes of music change, the fundamental laws of the state always change with them;"{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} although this was written as a warning this can be taken as a revolutionary statement that music is much more than just melodies and harmonies but a much more important movement in the life of all human beings.

==Folk music==

===American folk revival===
The song "[[We Shall Overcome]]" is perhaps the best-known example of political [[folk music]], in this case a rallying-cry for the [[US]] [[Civil Rights Movement]]. [[Pete Seeger]] was involved in the popularisation of the song, as was [[Joan Baez]].&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Noah|title=The History of 'We Shall Overcome'|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1031839|accessdate=17 February 2012|date=15 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early part of the 20th century, poor working conditions and [[class struggle]] lead to the growth of the [[Labour movement]] and numerous songs advocating social and political reform. The most famous songwriter of the early 20th century "[[Wobblies]]" was [[Joe Hill]]. Later, from the 1940s through the 1960s, groups like the [[Almanac Singers]] and [[The Weavers]] were influential in reviving this type of socio-political music. [[Woody Guthrie]]'s "This Land Is Your Land" is one of the most famous American folk songs and its lyrics exemplify Guthrie's [[socialism|socialistic]] patriotism.&lt;ref name="Folk Hero"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hajdu|first=David|title=Review: Folk Hero|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/03/29/040329crbo_books?currentPage=1.|accessdate=13 March 2012|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=29 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pete Seeger's "[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]", was a popular anti-war [[protest song]].&lt;ref name="Pete Seeger"&gt;{{cite web|last=PBS|title=The Power of Song|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/pete-seeger/the-power-of-song/50/|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these types of songs became popular during the Vietnam War era. "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]", by [[Bob Dylan]], was a hit for [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], and suggested that a younger generation was becoming more aware of global problems than many of the older generation.&lt;ref name="dissentmagazine.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/the-political-bob-dylan |title=The Political Bob Dylan |publisher=Dissent Magazine |date=2016-11-13 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Joan Baez had a top-ten hit in the UK&lt;ref name="Top Hits 1965"&gt;{{cite web|title=Favorites in the UK 1965|url=http://www.severing.nu/music/1965UK.html|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with "[[There but for Fortune (song)|There but for Fortune]]" (by [[Phil Ochs]]); it was a plea for the innocent victim of prejudice or inhumane policies.&lt;ref name=Unterberger&gt;{{cite web|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|title=There But for Fortune|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/there-but-for-fortune-t1020598|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many topical songwriters with social and political messages emerged from the [[American folk music revival|folk music revival]] of the 1960s, including Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Phil Ochs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/philochs2.html |title=Perfect Sound Forever: Phil Ochs |website=Furious.com |date=1976-04-09 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Paxton]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], and others.

The folk revival can be considered as a political re-invention of traditional song, a development encouraged by [[Left-wing politics|Left]]-leaning folk record labels and magazines such as [[Sing Out!]] and [[Broadside (magazine)|Broadside]]. The revival began in the 1930s&lt;ref name="30s to 60s folk music revival"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eyerman and Barretta|first=Ron and Scott|title=From the 30s to the 60s: The folk music revival in the United States|url=http://web.uni-frankfurt.de/fb09/kunstpaed/indexweb/jukult/folk.pdf|publisher=Springer|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued after [[World War II]]. Folk songs of this time gained popularity by using old hymns and songs but adapting the lyrics to fit the current social and political conditions.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 508&lt;/ref&gt; Archivists and artists such as [[Alan Lomax]], [[Lead Belly]] and Woody Guthrie were crucial in popularising folk music, and the latter began to be known as the Lomax singers.&lt;ref name=Reuss&gt;{{cite book|last=Reuss and Reuss|first=Richard and Joanne|title=American Folk Music and Left Wing Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EycS7FSTAyUC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=folk+topical+recordings+left+wing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y2GOBM-opV&amp;sig=oobIuBpQghNCnp3f2Al21JaMWj8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rj1_T6jwI4Sk8gS09KjNBw&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=folk%20topical%20recordings%20left%20wing&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an era of folk music in which some artists and their songs expressed clear political messages with the intention of swaying public opinion and recruiting support.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 502&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[UK]], [[Ewan MacColl]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewanmaccoll.co.uk/ewan-maccoll-biography/ |title=Ewan MacColl Biography |website=Ewanmaccoll.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[A. L. Lloyd]] performed similar roles, with Lloyd as folklorist&lt;ref&gt;Lee, CP (2009), 'Like the night: Reception and reaction, Dylan's 1966 UK tour', in: ''Highway 61 Revisited: Bob Dylan's Road From Minnesota To The World'', University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis USA, pp. 78-84.&lt;/ref&gt; and MacColl (often with [[Peggy Seeger]]) releasing dozens of albums which blended traditional songs with newer political material influenced by their [[CPGB|Communist]] activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ewan-maccoll.info/AlbumInfo.aspx?ID=239 |title=Peggy Seeger and Ewan MacColl - Songs Of Struggle |website=Ewan-maccoll.info |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Neil Spencer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/25/ewan-maccoll-godfather-folk-adored-and-feared |title=Ewan MacColl: the godfather of folk who was adored – and feared &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Colin Irwin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/apr/23/british-folk-music |title=The battle over British folk music &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later, post-war revival, folk music found a new audience with college students, partly since universities provided the organisation necessary for sustaining music trends and an expanded, impressionable audience looking to rebel against the older generation.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 522&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the rhetoric of the United States government during the [[Cold War]] era was very powerful and in some ways overpowered the message of folk artists, such as in relation to public opinion regarding Communist-backed political causes. Various Gallup Polls that were conducted during this time suggest that Americans consistently saw Communism as a threat; for example, a 1954 poll shows that at the time 51% of Americans said that admitted Communists should be arrested, and in relation to music 64% of respondents said that if a radio singer is an admitted Communist he should be fired.&lt;ref name="Cold War Gallup"&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=John|title=Seeing Red: The Cold War and American Public Opinion|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/foreign-policy/cold-war/conference/white.html|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading figures in the American folk revival such as Seeger, [[Earl Robinson]] and [[Irwin Silber]] were or had been members of the [[CPUSA|Communist Party]], while others such as Guthrie (who had written a column for CPUSA magazine [[New Masses]]), [[Lee Hays]] and [[Paul Robeson]] were considered [[Fellow travellers#McCarthyism|fellow travellers]]. As [[McCarthyism]] began to dominate the United States population and government, it was more difficult for folk artists to travel and perform since folk was pushed out of mainstream music.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996 p. 520&lt;/ref&gt; Artists were blacklisted, denounced by [[House Committee on Un-American Activities#Standing committee|politicians]] and the media, and in the case of the 1949 [[Peekskill Riots]], subject to mob attack.

In general, the significance of lyrics within folk music reduced as it became influenced by [[rock and roll]].&lt;ref name="Folk Music 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=James|first=David|title=The Vietnam War and American Music|journal=Social Text|year=1989|pages=122–143|jstor=466424}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the popular folk revival's last phase in the early 1960s, new folk artists such as Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs began writing their own, original topical music, as opposed to mainly adapting traditional folksong.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 528&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blues and black American music===
Blues songs have the reputation of being resigned to fate rather than fighting against misfortune, but there have been exceptions. [[Bessie Smith]] recorded protest song "Poor Man Blues" in 1928. [[Josh White]] recorded "When Am I Going to be Called a Man" in 1936 – at this time it was common for white men to address black men as "boy" – before releasing two albums of explicitly political material, 1940's ''Chain Gang'' and 1941's ''Southern Exposure: An Album of Jim Crow Blues''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elijahwald.com/joshprotest.html |title=Josh White and the Protest Blues, by Elijah Wald |website=Elijahwald.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead Belly's "Bourgeois Blues" and [[Big Bill Broonzy]]'s "Black, Brown and White" (aka "Get Back") protested racism. [[Billie Holiday]] recorded and popularised the song "[[Strange Fruit]]" in 1939. Written by Communist [[Lewis Allan]], and also recorded by Josh White and [[Nina Simone]], it addressed [[Southern United States|Southern]] racism, specifically the lynching of African-Americans, and was performed as a protest song in New York venues, including [[Madison Square Gardens]]. In the post-war era, [[J.B. Lenoir]] gained a reputation for political and social comment; his record label pulled the planned release of 1954 single "Eisenhower Blues" due to its title&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bill Dahl |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jb-lenoir-mn0000115733/biography |title=J.B. Lenoir &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later material protested civil rights, racism and the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Schwachter |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/vietnam-blues-the-complete-l-r-recording-mw0000178679 |title=Vietnam Blues: The Complete L&amp;R Recording - J.B.

Paul Robeson, singer, actor, athlete, and civil rights activist, was investigated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and was called before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) for his outspoken [[Political views of Paul Robeson|political views]]. The [[State Department]] denied Robeson a passport and issued a "stop notice" at all ports, effectively confining him to the United States. In a symbolic act of defiance against the travel ban, labour unions in the U.S. and Canada organised a concert at the International [[Peace Arch]] on the border between [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state and the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]] on May 18, 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; Robeson stood on the back of a flat bed truck on the U.S. side of the border and performed a concert for a crowd on the Canadian side, variously estimated at between 20,000 and 40,000 people. He returned to perform a second concert at the Peace Arch in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;Duberman p. 411&lt;/ref&gt; and over the next two years two further concerts were scheduled.

[[Disco music|Disco]], contrary to popular opinion, originated in [[Black people|Black]] [[queer]] communities and offered these communities a form of salvation or safe haven from social turmoil during the 1970s, in the [[Bronx]] and other parts of [[New York City|New York]]. It was agreed by many members prominent in the Disco scene that the music was about love and the vitality of "absorbing the feeling", but the question regarding its political import received mixed responses. Although the songs themselves may not have explicitly made political claims, it's important to note that disco, for many, was a "form of escape" and noted a "dissolve of restrictions on black/gay people".&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, Tim ''Disco and the Queering of the Dance Floor.'', Cultural Studies, 25:2, 230-243, DOI: 10.1080/9502386.2011.535989&lt;/ref&gt; The spirit of the 60s as well as the experience of [[Vietnam war|Vietnam]] and black/gay liberation spurred the almost-frenzied energy pertinent in these discotheques. Not only did discos allow marginalized individuals an opportunity to express their sexuality and appreciate one another's diversity, they had the ability to influence popular music. Although once mutually exclusive, discotheques allowed for the coming together of black music and pop; this shows how disco music not only led to a social appreciation for diversity, but offered a platform on which Black artists could succeed.
The eventual commercialization of disco set in motion its decline. This new commodified disco, very different than its diverse and queer roots, idealized the white individual and favored heteronormative relations. This not only allowed for the roots of such a diverse movement to be lost, but the erasure of the liberation and escapism it offered many minorities.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Contemporary Western folk music===
Although public attention shifted to [[rock music]] from the mid 1960s, folk singers such as Joan Baez and Tom Paxton continued to address political concerns in their music and activism. Baez's 1974 ''[[Gracias a la Vida (album)|Gracias a la Vida]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Ruhlmann |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/gracias-a-la-vida-mw0000651422 |title=Gracias a la Vida - Joan Baez &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; album was a response to [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|events]] in [[Chile]] and included versions of songs by [[Nueva canción|Nueva Canción Chilena]] singer-songwriters [[Violeta Parra]] and [[Victor Jara]]. Paxton albums such as ''Outward Bound''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Richie Unterberger]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/outward-bound-mw0000785860 |title=Outward Bound - Tom Paxton &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Morning Again''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Richie Unterberger]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/morning-again-mw0000786225 |title=Morning Again - Tom Paxton &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; continued to highlight political issues. They were joined by other activist musicians such as [[Holly Near]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Ruhlmann |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hang-in-there-mw0000104473 |title=Hang in There - Holly Near &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ray Korona]], [[Charlie King (folksinger)|Charlie King]], [[Anne Feeney]], [[Jim Page (singer)|Jim Page]], [[Utah Phillips]] and more recently [[David Rovics]].

In [[Ireland]], the [[Wolfe Tones]] is perhaps the best known band in the folk protest/[[irish rebel music|rebel music]] tradition, recording political material since the late 1960s including songs by [[Dominic Behan]] on albums such as ''[[Let the People Sing (Wolfe Tones album)|Let the People Sing]]'' and ''[[Rifles of the I.R.A.]]'' [[Christy Moore]] has also recorded much political material, including on debut solo album ''[[Paddy on the Road]]'', produced by and featuring songs by Dominic Behan, and on albums such as ''[[Ride On (Christy Moore album)|Ride On]]'' (including "[[Viva la Quinta Brigada (song)|Viva la Quinta Brigada]]"), ''[[Ordinary Man (Christy Moore album)|Ordinary Man]]'' and various artists LP ''[[H Block]]'' to which Moore contributed "Ninety Miles from Dublin", in response to the [[Irish Republicanism|Republican]] prisoners' [[blanket protest]] of the late 1970s. Earlier in the decade, [[The Barleycorn]] had held the [[List of number-one singles of 1972 (Ireland)|#1 spot on the Irish charts]] for five weeks in 1972 with their first release "[[The Men Behind the Wire]]", about [[Operation Demetrius|internment]], with all profits going to the families of internees; [[Irish republicanism|Republican]] label R&amp;O Records likewise released several records around this time to fundraise for the same cause, including the live album ''Smash Internment'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.45worlds.com/vinyl/album/rol3002 |title=Vinyl Album - Various Artists - Smash Internment And Injustice - Live Recording In Long Kesh - R &amp; O - Ireland |website=45worlds.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded in [[Long Kesh]], and The Wolfhounds' recording of [[Paddy McGuigan]]'s "[[The Boys of the Old Brigade]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/ro1001 |title=The Wolfhounds [Ireland&amp;#93; - The Boys Of The Old Brigade / Ashtown Road - R&amp;O - Ireland - RO.1001 |website=45cat.com |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk music around the world===
Folk music had a strong connection with politics internationally. [[Hungary]], for instance, experimented with a form of liberal Communism in the late [[Cold War]] era, which was reflected in much of their folk music.&lt;ref name="World Music"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bohlman|first=Philip|title=World Music: A Very Short Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late twentieth century [[folk music]] was crucial in [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]] as it allowed ethnicities to express their national identity in a time of political uncertainty and chaos.&lt;ref&gt;World Music 2002, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

In Communist [[China]], exclusively national music was promoted. A flautist named Zhao Songtim – a member of the Zhejiang Song-and-Dance Troupe – attended an Arts festival in 1957 in Mexico but was punished for his international outlook by being expelled from the Troupe, and from 1966 to 1970 underwent "re-education". In 1973 he returned to the Troupe but was expelled again following accusations.&lt;ref&gt;''Folk Music of China'' (1995) by Stephen Jones, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of folk music being used for conservative, rather than radical, political ends is shown by the cultural activities of [[Edward Lansdale]], a [[CIA]] chief who dedicated part of his career to [[counter-insurgency]] in the [[Philippines]] and Vietnam. Lansdale believed that the government's best weapon against Communist rebellion was the support and trust of the population. In 1953 he arranged for the release of a campaign song widely credited with helping to elect Philippine president [[Ramon Magsaysay]], an important [[US]] anti-communist ally.&lt;ref name="Folk Music"/&gt; In 1965, intrigued by local Vietnamese customs and traditions, and the potential use of 'applied folklore' as a technique of raising consciousness, he began to record and curate tapes of folk songs for intelligence purposes. He also urged performers such as [[Phạm Duy]] to write and perform patriotic songs to raise morale in South Vietnam. Duy had written topical songs popular during the [[First Indochina war|anti-French struggle]] but then broke with the Communist-dominated [[Viet Minh]].&lt;ref name="Folk Music"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fish|first=Lydia|title=General Edward G. Lansdale and the Folksongs of Americans in the Vietnam War|journal=American Folklore|year=1989|volume=102|pages=390–411|jstor=541780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of political lyrics and the taking of political stances by rock musicians can be traced back to the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]],&lt;ref name="furious.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/marcus.html |title=Greil Marcus interview |website=Furious.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically the influence of the early career of Bob Dylan,&lt;ref name="dissentmagazine.org"/&gt; itself shaped by the politicised [[American folk music revival|folk revival]].

===1960s–70s counterculture===
During the 1960s and early 1970s counterculture era, musicians such as [[John Lennon]] commonly expressed protest themes in their music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/133778-revolutionary-man-john-lennon-as-political-artist/ |title=Revolutionary Man: John Lennon As Political Artist |publisher=PopMatters |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example on the [[Plastic Ono Band]]'s 1969 single "[[Give Peace a Chance]]". Lennon later devoted [[Some Time in New York City|an entire album]] to politics and wrote the song [[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]], widely considered to be a peace anthem. Its lyrics invoke a world without religion, national borders or private property.
 
In 1962-63, [[Bob Dylan]] sang about the evils of war, racism and poverty on his trademark political albums "[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]" and "[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]" (released in 1964), popularising the cause of the Civil Rights Movement. Dylan was influenced by the folk revival, as well as by the [[Beat Generation|Beat]] writers, and the political beliefs of the young generation of the era.&lt;ref name="dissentmagazine.org"/&gt; In turn, while Dylan's political phase comes under the 'folk' category, he was known as a rock artist from 1965 and remained associated with an anti-establishment stance that influenced other musicians – such as the [[British Invasion]] bands – and the rock music audience, by broadening the spectrum of subjects that could be addressed in popular song.&lt;ref name="furious.com"/&gt;

The [[MC5]] (Motor City 5) came out of the [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] underground scene of the late 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/MC5/benedmonds.html |title=MC5- Ben Edmonds interview |website=Furious.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and embodied an aggressive evolution of [[garage rock]] which was often fused with socio-political and countercultural lyrics, such as in the songs "Motor City Is Burning", (a [[John Lee Hooker]] cover adapting the story of the [[Detroit Race Riot (1943)]] to the [[12th Street riot|1967 12th Street Detroit Riot]]), and "American Ruse" (which discusses U.S. [[police brutality]] as well as [[pollution]], [[prison]], [[materialism]] and [[rebellion]]). They had ties to [[Far left|radical leftist]] groups such as [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers]] and [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]]'s [[White Panther Party]]. MC5 was the only band to perform a set before the [[1968 Democratic Convention]] in [[Chicago]], as part of the [[Yippie]]s' [[Festival of Life]] where an infamous riot subsequently broke out between police and students protesting the recent [[assassination]] of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and the [[Vietnam War]].

Other rock groups that conveyed specific political messages in the late 1960s/early 1970s – [[List of songs about the Vietnam War|often in regard to the Vietnam War]] – include [[The Fugs]], [[Country Joe and the Fish]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], and [[Third World War (band)|Third World War]], while some bands, such as The Beatles, [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Hawkwind]], referenced political issues occasionally and in a more observational than engaged way, e.g. in songs like "[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]", "[[Street Fighting Man]]", "[[Salt of the Earth (song)|Salt of the Earth]]" and "[[Urban Guerrilla]]".

===Punk rock===
{{Main article|Punk ideologies}}

Notable punk rock bands, such as [[Crass]], [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[The Clash]], [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Refused]], [[American Standards]], [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], [[Millions of Dead Cops|MDC]], [[Aus-Rotten]], [[Anti-Flag]], and [[Leftover Crack]] have used political and sometimes controversial lyrics that attack the establishment, sexism, capitalism, racism, speciesism, colonialism, and other phenomena they see as sources of social problems.

Since the late 1970s, [[punk rock]] has been associated with various left-wing or anti-establishment ideologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/612/what-riot-punk-rock-politics-fascism-and-rock-against-racism|title=What Riot?

The sincerity of the early punk bands has been questioned – some critics saw their referencing of revolutionary politics as a provocative pose rather than an ideology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burchill and Parsons|first=Julie and Tony|title=The Boy Looked At Johnny|year=1978|publisher=[[Pluto Press]]|location=London|isbn=0-86104-030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Denselow|first=Robin|title=When The Music's Over|year=1989|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London|isbn=0-571-13906-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; – but bands such as [[Crass]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Richie Unterberger]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/crass-mn0000129637/biography |title=Crass &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dead Kennedys]]&lt;ref name="DKs"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dead-kennedys-mn0000786613/biography |title=Dead Kennedys &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; later emerged who held strong anarchist views, and over time this association strengthened, as they went on to influence other bands in the UK [[anarcho-punk]] and US [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] [[subgenre]]s, respectively.

The Sex Pistols song "[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]" was banned from broadcast by the BBC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/sex-pistols-mn0000418740/biography |title=Sex Pistols &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|1977]] due to its presumed anti-[[Royalism]], partly due to its apparent equation of the monarchy with a "fascist regime". The following year, the release of debut Crass album [[The Feeding Of the 5000]] was initially obstructed when pressing plant workers refused to produce it due to sacrilegious lyrical content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Matt Grimes |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/a-history-of-music-censorship-9051887.html |title=A history of music censorship |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crass later faced court charges of obscenity related to their [[Penis Envy (album)|Penis Envy]] album, as the Dead Kennedys later did over their [[Frankenchrist]] album artwork.&lt;ref name="DKs"/&gt;

[[The Clash]] are regarded as pioneers of political punk, and were seen to represent a progressive, socialistic worldview compared to the apparently anti-social or [[Political nihilism|nihilistic]] attack of many early punk bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Antonino D’Ambrosio |url=http://monthlyreview.org/2003/06/01/let-fury-have-the-hour-the-passionate-politics-of-joe-strummer |title='Let Fury Have the Hour': The Passionate Politics of Joe Strummer by Antonino D’Ambrosio |publisher=Monthly Review |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-clash-mn0000075747/biography |title=The Clash &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly inspired by 1960s protest music such as the MC5, their stance influenced other first and second wave punk/[[new wave music|new wave]] bands such as [[The Jam]], [[The Ruts]], [[Stiff Little Fingers]], [[Angelic Upstarts]], [[Tom Robinson Band|TRB]] and [[Newtown Neurotics]], and inspired a lyrical focus on subjects such as [[White Riot|racial tension]], [[Career Opportunities (song)|unemployment]], [[Garageland (song)|class resentment]], [[London's Burning (The Clash song)|urban alienation]] and police violence, as well as [[I'm So Bored with the USA|imperialism]].

Many punk musicians, such as [[Vic Bondi]] ([[Articles of Faith (band)|Articles of Faith]]), [[Joey Keithley]] ([[DOA (band)|DOA]]), [[Tim McIlrath]] ([[Rise Against]]), [[The Crucifucks]], [[Bad Religion]], [[The Proletariat]], [[Against All Authority]], [[Dropkick Murphys]] and [[Crashdog]] have held and expressed left-wing views. Dead Kennedys singer [[Jello Biafra]], as well as [[T.S.O.L.]] frontman [[Jack Grisham]], have run as candidates for public office under left-wing platforms. However, some punk bands have expressed more [[Populism|populist]] and [[conservative]] opinions, and an ambiguous form of [[patriotism]], beginning in the U.S with many of the groups associated with 1980s [[New York hardcore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Damon Root |url=http://reason.com/blog/2009/12/08/the-politics-of-hardcore-punk |title=The Politics of Hardcore Punk - Hit &amp; Run |website=Reason.com |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prior to that in the UK with a small section of the [[Oi!]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Worley |url=http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/03/20/tcbh.hwt001.full |title=Oi!

An extremely small minority of punk rock bands, exemplified by (1980s-era) [[Skrewdriver]] and [[Skullhead]], have held [[far-right politics|far-right]] and [[anticommunism|anti-communist]] stances, and were consequently reviled in the broader, largely Leftist punk subculture.

===Rock the Vote===
[[Rock the Vote]] is an American [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit]], [[non-partisan]] organization founded in Los Angeles in 1990 by Jeff Ayeroff for the purposes of political advocacy. Rock the Vote works to engage youth in the political process by incorporating the entertainment community and youth culture into its activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockthevote.com/rtv_about.php |title=About Rock the Vote |website=Rockthevote.com |date=1993-02-05 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock the Vote's stated mission is to "build the political clout and engagement of young people in order to achieve progressive change in our country."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120930064408/http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=ind_focus.story&amp;STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F12-19-2007%2F0004725469&amp;EDATE=WED+Dec+19+2007%2C+09%3A00+AM ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hip hop==
Hip hop music has been associated with protest since 1982, when "[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]" by [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]] became known as the first prominent rap record to make a serious “social statement”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/message-bronx-history-rap-city-article-1.576580|title=MESSAGE FROM THE BRONX     THE HISTORY OF RAP IN THE CITY|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-50-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time-20121205/grandmaster-flash-and-the-furious-five-the-message-19691231|title=50 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs of All Time|website=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the first political rap release has been credited to Brother D and the Collective Effort’s 1980 single “How We Gonna Make the Black Nation Rise?” which called the USA a “police state” and rapped about historical injustices such as slavery and ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2013/08/05/alex-abramovich/agitate-educate-organize/|title=Alex Abramovich: Agitate, Educate, Organize|first=Alex|last=Abramovich|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the decade hip hop band [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] became "perhaps the most well-known and influential political rap group"&lt;ref name="grio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegrio.com/2010/06/15/hip-hop-and-politics-have-a-long-history-behind-the-mic/|title=Hip-hop and politics have a long history behind the mic - theGrio|date=15 June 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released a series of records whose message and success "directed hip-hop toward an explicitly self-aware, pro-black consciousness that became the culture's signature throughout the next decade,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/public-enemy-mn0000856785/biography|title=Public Enemy - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; helping to inspire a wave of politicised hip hop by artists such as [[X Clan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/x-clan-mn0000585601/biography|title=X Clan - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poor Righteous Teachers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/poor-righteous-teachers-mn0000852698/biography|title=Poor Righteous Teachers - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brand Nubian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/brand-nubian-mn0000933772/biography|title=Brand Nubian - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2 Black 2 Strong MMG|2 Black 2 Strong]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/2-black-2-strong-mn0000899479/biography|title=2 Black 2 Strong - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paris (rapper)|Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/paris-mn0000003182/biography|title=Paris - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular music==
Popular music found throughout the world contains political messages such as those concerning social issues and racism. For example, Lady Gaga's song [[Born This Way (song)]] has often been known as the international gay anthem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mo|first1=Jang|title=When Pop Music Meets A Political Issue: Examining How "Born This Way" Influences Attitudes Toward Gays And Gay Rights Policies.|journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|date=2014|volume=1|issue=58|pages=114–130|doi=10.1080/08838151.2013.875023}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it discusses homosexuality in a positive light and expresses the idea that it is natural. Furthermore, the natural disaster of [[Hurricane Katrina]] received a great political response from the [[hip-hop|Hip hop music]] community. The content of the music changed into a response showing the complex dynamic of the community, especially the black community, while also acting a sometimes contradictory protest of how the disaster was handled in the aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=George|first1=Courtney|title=From Bounce To The Mainstream: Hip Hop Representations Of Post-Katrina New Orleans In Music, Film And Television|journal=European Journal of American Culture|date=2016|volume=35|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This topic even reached beyond the locality of New Orleans, as the issue of the disaster and racism was mentioned by other rappers from other regions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=George|first1=Courtney|title=From Bounce To The Mainstream: Hip Hop Representations Of Post-Katrina New Orleans In Music, Film And Television.|journal=European Journal of American Culture|date=2016|volume=35|issue=1|pages=17–32|doi=10.1386/ejac.35.1.17_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racist music==
{{Distinguish|Race music}}
Racist music or [[white power music]] is music associated with and promoting [[neo-Nazism]] and [[white supremacy]] ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;''Intelligence Report'': a project of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], Issues 133-136; Southern Poverty Law Center, Klanwatch Project, Southern Poverty Law Center. Militia Task Force, Publisher Klanwatch, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Musicology|musicologists]] point out that many, if not most early cultures had songs to promote themselves and denigrate any perceived enemies, the origins of Racist music is traced to the 1970s. By 2001 there were many music genres with 'white power rock' the most commonly represented band type, followed by [[National Socialist black metal]].&lt;ref name=pulera&gt;Dominic J. Pulera, ''Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America'',  pages 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt; 'Racist country music' is mainly an American phenomena while Germany, Great Britain, and Sweden have higher concentration of white power bands.&lt;ref name=pulera/&gt; Other music genres include 'fascist experimental music' and 'racist folk music'.&lt;ref name=pulera/&gt; Contemporary white-supremacist groups include "subcultural factions that are largely organized around the promotion and distribution of racist music."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Perry, ''Hate Crimes'', Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|0-275-99569-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-275-99569-0}}, 2009, pages 51-2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]] "racist music is principally derived from the far-right skinhead movement and, through the internet, this music has become perhaps the most important tool of the international neo-Nazi movement to gain revenue and new recruits."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hreoc.gov.au/racial_discrimination/cyberracism/examples.html "Racist Music: Publication, Merchandising and Recruitment"], ''[[Cyber racism]]'', Race Discrimination Unit, HREOC, October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Rooney, ''Race Hate'', Evans Brothers, 2006, {{ISBN|0-237-52717-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-237-52717-4}}, page 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The news documentary ''[[VH1]] News Special: Inside Hate Rock'' (2002) noted that Racist music (also called 'Hate music' and 'Skinhead rock') is "a breeding ground for [[Domestic terrorism in the United States|home-grown terrorists]]."&lt;ref&gt;David Bianculli, [http://articles.nydailynews.com/2002-02-18/entertainment/18189857_1_white-supremacist-eighth-letter-hate ''Vh1 Special Goes Behind The (racist) Music''], ''[[New York Daily News]]'', February 18, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 a neo-Nazi record company launched "Project Schoolyard" to distribute free CDs of the music into the hands of up to 100,000 teenagers throughout the U.S., their website stated, "We just don't entertain racist kids … We create them."&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Foxman, [http://www.worldpress.org/Americas/1997.cfm "Hate Music: New Recruitment Tool for White Supremacists"], ''Worldpress.org'', December 17, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Houghton, of the [[National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism]], said that Racist music was a great recruiting tool, "Through music ... to grab these kids, teach them to be racists and hook them for life."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120105013218/http://www.koco.com/r/3962764/detail.html "Record Label Targets Teens With Hate Message: Sampler CD Of White Power Music Circulating In Numerous U.S. Schools"], Ohio/Oklahoma Hearst Television Inc. on behalf of ''KOCO-TV'',  December 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Country music==
American [[country music]] contains numerous images of "[[tradition]]al" life, family life, religious life, as well as patriotic themes. Songs such as [[Merle Haggard]]'s "[[The Fightin' Side of Me]]", and "[[Okie from Muskogee (song)|Okie from Muskogee]]" have been perceived as patriotic songs which contain an "us versus them" mentality directed at the [[counterculture]] "[[hippie]]s" and the [[anti-war]] crowd, though these were actually misconceptions by listeners who failed to understand their satirical nature.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Bill, "Country Music U.S.A," 2nd rev. ed. (University of Texas Press, Austin, 2002), p.371.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical music==
[[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|third symphony]] was originally called "Bonaparte". In 1804 Napoleon crowned himself emperor, whereupon Beethoven rescinded the dedication. The symphony was renamed "Heroic Symphony composed to Celebrate the Memory of a Great Man".{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s chorus of Hebrew slaves in the opera ''[[Nabucco]]'' is a kind of rallying-cry for Italians to throw off the yoke of Austrian domination (in the north) and French domination (near Rome)—the "Risorgimento". Following unification, Verdi was awarded a seat in the national parliament.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Richard Taruskin of the University of California accused [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] of "romanticizing terrorists" in his opera ''[[The Death of Klinghoffer]]'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;article in the December 9, 2001, ''New York Times'' Arts and Leisure section&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=March 2017}}&lt;!--Exactly how does this accusation by Taruskin constitute a political stance--is it Taruskin, as a music critic, or is it Adams, who somehow is obviously guilty of the charge?--&gt;

===In the Soviet Union===
[[RAPM (association)|RAPM]] (The Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians) was formed in the early 1920s. In 1929 Stalin gave them his backing. [[Shostakovich]] had dedicated his first symphony to Mikhail Kvardi. In 1929 Kvardi was arrested and executed. In an article in ''The Worker and the Theatre'', Shostakovich's ''The Tahitit Trot'' (from the ballet ''The Golden Age'') was criticised; Ivan Yershov claimed it was part of "ideology harmful to the proletariat"". Shostakovich's response was to write his third symphony, ''The First of May'' (1929) to express "the festive mood of peaceful construction".&lt;ref&gt;''Shostakovich and Stalin'' by Solomon Volkov (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Shostakovich Studies'' (1995) edited by David Fanning&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prokofiev]] wrote music to order for the Soviet Union, including ''Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution'' (1937). [[Khachaturian]]'s ballet ''Spartacus'' (1954/6) concerns gladiator slaves who rebel against their former Roman masters. It was seen as a metaphor for the overthrow of the Czar.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Similarly Prokofiev's music for the film ''[[Alexander Nevsky (Prokofiev)|Alexander Nevsky]]'' concerns the invasion of Teutonic knights into the Baltic States. It was seen as a metaphor for the Nazi invasion of the USSR.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} In general Soviet music was neo-romantic while Fascist music was neo-classical.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Music in Nazi Germany===
[[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] stated in 1930, "I don't believe anyone venerates [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] more than I";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sachs|first=Harvey|title=Music in fascist Italy|year=1988|publisher=Norton|location=New York|isbn=0-393-02563-2|authorlink=Harvey Sachs}}&lt;/ref&gt; however by 1943 Stravinsky was banned in Nazi Germany because he had chosen to live in the USA. Beginning in 1940, [[Carl Orff]]'s cantata ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'' was performed at Nazi Party functions, and acquired the status of a quasi-official anthem.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford History of Western Music, vol 4'' (2005) by Richard Taruskin&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 Berlin Radio issued a formal ban on the broadcasting of jazz. However, it was still possible to hear swing music played by German bands. This was because of the moderating influence of [[Goebbels]], who knew the value of entertaining the troops. In the period 1933-45 the music of [[Gustav Mahler]], a Jewish Austrian, virtually disappeared from the concert performances of the Berlin Philharmonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levi|first=Erik|title=Music in the Third Reich|year=1996|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-12948-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Strauss]]'s opera ''[[Die Schweigsame Frau]]'' (The Silent Woman) was banned from 1935 to 1945 because the librettist, [[Stefan Zweig]], was a Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= The Twisted Muse |last= Kater |first= Michael |year= 1999 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= 0-19-513242-4 |page= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nightcore''' edit is a [[remix]] track that speeds up the pitch and tempo of its source material by 10-30%. The name is derived from Nightcore, a Norwegian duo who released pitch-shifted versions of [[Trance music|trance]] and [[eurodance]] songs, but now refers to any sped-up music labelled as "nightcore". When nightcore is on a site like Youtube it would most likely have an Anime Image in the Background.

==2000s: Origins==
The Nightcore term was first used in 2002 as the name for a school project by Norwegian DJ duo '''Thomas S. Nilsen''' and '''Steffen Ojala Søderholm''', known by their stage name as DJ TNT and DJ SOS respectively. The name Nightcore means "we are the core of the night, so you'll dance all night long", stated in their website named "''Nightcore is Hardcore''".&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.hemsida.net/steffie/nightcore/biography.html|title=:!: Nightcore is Hardcore :!: biography|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070902142730/http://www2.hemsida.net/steffie/nightcore/biography.html|archivedate=2007-09-02|accessdate=2016-10-03|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two were influenced by pitch-shifted vocals in German group [[Scooter (band)|Scooter]]'s hardcore songs "[[Nessaja]]" and "[[The Logical Song#Scooter version|Ramp! (The Logical Song)]]", stating in an interview that "There were so few of these kinds of artists, we thought that mixing music in our style would be a pleasure for us to listen to" and "Nightcore has become a style of music, a way to make the music happier – 'happy hardcore' as they say."&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesupersuper.com/featured/nightcore-interview/|title=NIGHTCORE INTERVIEW &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; SUPERSUPER!

The duo set a template of a track in the style: a 25% sped-up (commonly to around 160 to 180 [[tempo (music)|beats per minute]]) of a [[trance (music)|trance]] or [[eurodance]] song.&lt;ref name = "NESTHQ"/&gt; The nightcore music has been compared to [[happy hardcore]] and [[wonky (music)|bubblegum bass]] due to its fast tempos, energetic feel and high-pitched vocals.&lt;ref name = "NESTHQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "DanceMusicNW"&gt;Harshman, Heath (July 25, 2015).

[http://nesthq.com/nightcore "Nest HQ's Guide to Nightcore"]. Nest HQ. [[OWSLA]]. Retrieved September 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "THUMP"/&gt;

Nightcore's works started appearing on services such as [[LimeWire]] and [[YouTube]] around the mid-2005. The first nightcore track to appear on the latter site was "Dam Dadi Doo" by the duo in 2006. Only two of the project's albums have surfaced on the Internet.&lt;ref name = "NESTHQ"/&gt; One of the first people to distribute nightcore music on [[YouTube]] was a user going by the name Maikel631, starting in 2008. He first uploaded around 30 original tracks by Nightcore on the website. In 2009, he found a "new" nightcore track and the technique to make material in the style: {{quote|I came to the realization that Nightcore songs could be made by everyone, using reasonably simple audio software. I was at least one of the first people to really use that knowledge to make Nightcore edits. oShyGuyzo did this before me with Nightcore II. Another channel which I followed and started exploring fan-made Nightcore around the same time was Nasinocinesino.&lt;ref name = "NESTHQ"/&gt;}}

==2010s: Popularity==
The first nightcore edit of a non-dance track was that of a track by rock band [[Evanescence]], uploaded on YouTube in 2011. From there, the music rose in popularity with more people applying the nightcore treatment to more non-dance genres such as [[pop music]] and [[hip-hop]]. Many of the pioneer uploaders of nightcore including Maikel631 have called these non-dance edits "fake".&lt;ref name = "NESTHQ"/&gt; The nightcore scene then crossed over to [[Soundcloud]] with the help of artist lilangelboi, who had released around ten to fifteen edits on the service before being signed to Manicure Records. The head of Manicure, Tom "Ghibli" Mike, recalled, "I just got totally obsessed with it. I put up that one he did, "Light", we had him up here to DJ a few parties, and then he moved here. That was totally how nightcore became a thing for us."&lt;ref name = "NESTHQ"/&gt; The label's #MANICURED playlist consisted of nightcore renditions of [[K-pop]] and [[electro house]] tracks, a few of them also incorporating production techniques outside of pitch-shifting and speeding up the source material, such as "Mile High" by Chipped Nails and Ponibbi and "Fave Hours" by F I J I.&lt;ref name = "NESTHQ"/&gt;

By the mid-2010s, the nightcore scene had garnered attention from musicians such as [[Djemba Djemba]], Maxo and Harrison, [[Nina Las Vegas]], [[Ryan Hemsworth]], [[Lido (musician)|Lido]], Moist Breezy, and PC Music founders Danny L Harle and A. G. Cook.&lt;ref name = "NESTHQ"/&gt; Harle and Cook have claimed nightcore to be influences in interviews,&lt;ref name = "NESTHQ"/&gt; the former saying in an interview, {{quote|From the second I first heard it, it's been so intensely emotional for me to listen to.

'''Parametricism''' is a style within contemporary [[avant-garde architecture]], promoted as a successor to [[post-modern architecture]] and [[modern architecture]]. The term was coined in 2008 by Patrik Schumacher, an architectural partner of [[Zaha Hadid]] (1950-2016).
&lt;ref name=aj&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/patrik-schumacher-on-parametricism-let-the-style-wars-begin/5217211.fullarticle |title=Patrik Schumacher on parametricism - 'Let the style wars begin' |last1=Schumacher |first1=Patrik |date=6 May 2010 |website=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/ |publisher= |access-date=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parametricism has its origin in parametric design, which is based on the constraints in a [[parametric equation]].&lt;ref name=coyne&gt;{{cite web |url=http://richardcoyne.com/2014/01/18/whats-wrong-with-parametricism/ |title=What’s wrong with parametricism

Aspects of parametricism have been used in [[urban design]], [[architectural design]], [[interior design]] and [[furniture design]]. Proponents of parametricism have declared that one of the defining features is that "Parametricism implies that all elements of the design become parametrically variable and mutually adaptive."&lt;ref name=agency&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parametricism.agency/ |title=PARAMETRICISM |date=9 October 2015 |website=www.parametricism.agency/ |publisher=ArchAgenda |access-date=25 December 2015 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226081700/http://www.parametricism.agency/# |archive-date=2015-12-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schumacher, parametricism is an [[autopoiesis]], or a self-referential system, in which all the elements are interlinked and an outside influence that changes one alters all the others."&lt;ref name=cornell&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.cornell.edu/arch5302sp15/2015/05/20/the-autopoiesis-of-architecture-patrik-schumachers-parametricism-and-theory/ |title="THE AUTOPOIESIS OF ARCHITECTURE" PATRIK SCHUMACHER’S PARAMETRICISM AND THEORY |first=Katerina|last=Eleini|date=20 May 2015 |website=http://blogs.cornell.edu/|publisher=Cornell |access-date=25 December 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!---text previously in this article, from a source that failed citation. "Its most conspicuous outward characteristic is a complex and dynamic curvilinearity accentuated by a swarm-like proliferation of continuously differentiated components. Beyond such obvious surface features one can identify a series of new concepts and methods that are so different from the repertoire of both traditional and modern architecture that one is justified in speaking of the emergence of a new paradigm within architecture. The shared concepts, formal repertoires, tectonic logics and computational techniques that characterize this work are indeed engendering the formation of a new [[Architectural style|style]]."&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, Patrik, Parametricism - The Parametric Paradigm and the Formation of a New Style.&lt;/ref&gt;---&gt;

Parametricism rejects both homogenization (serial repetition) and pure difference (agglomeration of unrelated elements) in favor of [[differentiation (economics)|differentiation]] and [[correlation]] as key compositional values. The aim is to build up more spatial [[complexity]] while maintaining legibility, i.e. to intensify relations between spaces (or elements of a composition) and to adapt to contexts in ways that establish legible connections.  This allows architecture to translate the complexity of contemporary life processes in the global [[Post-Fordist]] [[network society]].

==History==
Parametricism emerged as a theory-driven avant-garde design movement in the early 1990s, with its earliest practitioners - [[Greg Lynn]], Jesse Reiser, [[Lars Spuybroek]], [[Kas Oosterhuis]] among many others – harnessing and adapting the then new [[digital animation]] software and other advanced computational processes that had been introduced within architecture much earlier by pioneers like [[John Frazer (architect)|John Frazer]] and [[Paul Coates (architect)|Paul Coates]], but that only spread to make an impact within [[avant-garde]] architecture in the last 10–15 years.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, Greg. "CCA - Archeology of the Digital."&lt;/ref&gt; Schumaker has said that he believes the work of [[Frei Otto]] (1925 - 2015)  is a precursor of Parametricism, as Frei "used physical processes as simulations and design engines to 'find' form rather than to draw conventional or invented forms. The inherent lawfulness of the engaged physical processes produced a combination of complexity, rigor and [[elegance]] that was otherwise unattainable. The power and beauty of this approach was striking."&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, Patrik. "11. Parametricism - The Parametric Paradigm and the Formation of a New Style." p.619&lt;/ref&gt;

Early instances of proto-Parametricism, as manifest through the prolific generation of innovative designs and radical experiments within the transitional styles of [[Deconstructivism]] and [[Folding (architecture)|Folding]] - including the work of the discipline’s discourse leaders such as [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Wolf D. Prix]], [[Bernard Tschumi]], and [[Daniel Libeskind]]&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Phillip. "Deconstructivist Architecture - Museum of Modern Art - Fact Sheet."&lt;/ref&gt; - were later radicalized by younger practitioners who matured in the context of these early practices, and stabilized the discipline around prolonged research programmes thriving on emerging digital technologies, and culminating in the emergence of Parametricism.

Parametricism co-evolved with the global shift from the Modernist era of [[Fordism]] ([[mass production]]) to the [[Post-Fordist]] era ([[mass customization]]) of contemporary global society, and continues to evolve in an increasingly complex and fluid network of global societal communication systems. Parametricism offers advantages over styles that cannot (because they were never intended to) resonate and respond to the complexity and rapid fluidity of today’s society. Despite the persistence of styles such as [[modernism]], [[minimalism]], [[postmodernism]], [[historicism]] and [[deconstructivism]], a hard core of continuous innovation in research and building has stabilized around the new heuristics of Parametricism, and is continuing to proliferate the new style in academic and practice domains worldwide.

==[[Heuristics]]==
Parametricism offers functional and formal heuristics based on set of general abstract rules distilled from a very complex ecosystem of sustained avant-garde design research that spans over twenty five years of continuous innovative communication. Parametricism achieves elegance in both senses of the word – it is unified (compact) and beautiful (vital).

===Functional heuristics===
The functional heuristics of Parametricism include both Negative Principles and Positive Principles that have evolved since the mid-1990s across many projects worldwide, and that together constitute unifying heuristics. The Negative Principles include the avoidance of functional stereotypes (i.e. prescriptive program typologies), and the avoidance of segregative functional zoning (i.e. impermeable separation spaces according to single function allocation). The Positive Principles include the networking of parametric activity/event scenarios, and the communication of all spaces, activities and events.

===Formal heuristics===
Similar to the Functional heuristics, there are unified Formal heuristics distinguishing Parametricism from other styles of architecture. The Negative Principles include the avoidance of rigid forms that lack malleability; the avoidance of simple repetition that lacks variety; and the avoidance of collage of isolated and unrelated elements that result in a lack of order. The Positive Principles include the intelligent information-rich deformation of soft forms; differentiation of all systems through gradients, thresholds and singularities; and interdependent correlation of all systems.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, Patrik. "11. Parametricism - The Parametric Paradigm and the Formation of a New Style." p.657&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
[[File:Olympic park 12.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Munich Olympic Stadium (Frei Otto and Günther Behnisch, 1972)]]

===Proto Parametricism (1952-1992)===
Throughout his career, [[Frei Otto]] conducted research focused on constructing light-weight, tensile structures through form-finding physical models that performed analog "material computation". This work is regarded as the precursor to Parametricism. His design for the [[Olympic Stadium, Munich]], built for the [[1972 Summer Olympics]], is a celebrated example of highly innovative lightweight tent construction, designed in collaboration with the architect [[Günther Behnisch]].

===Early Parametricism (1993-2008)===

Beyond the discursive paradigm shifts that led to the emergence of Parametricism, the ambition of the early built projects (1993-2008) was focused on adapting and innovating manufacturing and construction processes, upgrading the discipline's capacity to translate complex digital designs into constructible material assemblies.

One of the earliest built examples, [[Lars Spuybroek]]'s (NOX-Magazine) Water Pavilion (1993-1997), was the first building to utilize sensors throughout the interior, creating an interactive environment (also known as [[responsive architecture]]) where light and sound could be transformed by visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Osness, B. (2012, December 1). HtwoOexpo the Water Pavilion, Lars Spuybroek NOX. Retrieved May 12, 2015, from http://brettosness.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/finalhtwo0_small.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was praised by the renowned architecture critic Charles Jencks as "yet to be surpassed" in his book The New Paradigm of Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;
Jencks, C. (2002). The new paradigm in architecture: The language of Post-modernism. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the early examples of a project designed from the outset in three-dimensional computer model is Kas Oosterhuis' Saltwater Pavilion (Gold Award 1997 for innovative recreational projects, Zeeuwse Architectuurprijs 1998, nomination Mies van der Rohe Award 1998). "The delineation of the form is laid down in the digital genes of the design that hold the germ of life. The first idea is the genetic starting point for all subsequent steps in the development. We no longer accept the domination of platonic volumes, the simplistic geometry of cube, sphere, cylinder and cone as the basic elements of architecture.".&lt;ref&gt;Oosterhuis, K. (n.d.). Salt Water Pavilion and Hydra sensorium. Retrieved May 12, 2015, from http://www.onl.eu/?q=projects/salt-water-pavilion&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most critically acclaimed and stylistically defining of the earliest projects is the Yokohama International Passenger Terminal (1995-2002), designed by [[Foreign Office Architects]], FOA, headed by [[Farshid Moussavi]] and [[Alejandro Zaera-Polo]]. The project was praised for its "inventive architectural methodology and socially conscious thinking". The project broke new ground, both formally and socially, enriching a prominent shared urban space.&lt;ref&gt;AD Classics: Yokohama International Passenger Terminal / Foreign Office Architects (FOA).

Another notable early example is a project designed by [[Greg Lynn]] (FORM), Douglas Garofalo (Garofalo Architects) and Michael McInturf (Michael McInturf Architects) using vector-based animation software (1999). This addition of a 1500-seat sanctuary on the roof of a renovated laundry factory was part of its conversion to the New York Presbyterian Church in Queens, New York (1999.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Lynn: Korean presbyterian church, new york. (2012, November 16). Retrieved May 12, 2015, from http://www.designboom.com/architecture/greg-lynn-korean-presbyterian-church-of-new-york&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most celebrated and stylistically defining of the early built projects is the [[Phaeno Science Center]] in [[Wolfsburg]], Germany, designed by Zaha Hadid Architects starting in 2000. The building opened to the public in 2005, and has been described as a "hypnotic work of architecture - the kind of building that utterly transforms our vision of the future." It won a 2006 RIBA European Award,&lt;ref&gt;RIBA European Award winners 2006. (n.d.). Retrieved May 12, 2015, from http://www.architecture.com/RIBA/Awards/RIBAEuropeanAwards/2006/RIBAEuropeanAwards2006.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2006 [[Institution of Structural Engineers]] Award for Arts, Leisure and Entertainment Structures.

A later example is the 21-story concrete shell tower 0-14 in Dubai, UAE (2007), designed by Reiser + Umemoto. The structural shell creates a unique lace-like facade is modulated for variable light and views. The one meter space between the shell and main enclosure creates natural air movement that cools the glass facade. This is a very early example of the environmental design benefits that are achieved by applying the adaptive heuristics of Parametricism. The building's load-bearing concrete shell eliminates the need for internal columns and load-bearing walls.&lt;ref&gt;Reiser, J. (n.d.). RUR Architecture PC.

[[Morphosis Architects]]' [[Giant Interactive Group]] Corporate Headquarters, designed in 2005-2006 and constructed in 2009-2010, is described by the architects as "emerging organically from complexity".&lt;ref&gt;Morphosis.

===Parametricism 1.0 (2009-2014)===
The most complex and important built projects designed in the style of Parametricism were completed after the global financial crisis of 2008.

[[Coop Himmelb(l)au]]'s Dalian International Conference Center in [[Dalian]], [[Liaoning]], China, was completed in 2012. It has become "an instantly recognizable landmark" and "centerpiece of emerging Central Business District in the city of Dalian, bringing a parametric design to the edge of the Bay of Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Dalian International Conference Center. (n.d.). Retrieved May 12, 2015, from http://en.wikiarquitectura.com/index.php/Dalian_International_Conference_Center&lt;/ref&gt; The dynamically fluid, modulated vector field articulated on the exterior enclosure correlates the level and direction of natural light penetration to the organizational spatial distribution of the interior spaces.

The [[Louis Vuitton Foundation]] was designed by [[Frank Gehry|Gehry Partners]] between 2006-2014. It is considered "a catalyst internationally for innovation in digital design and construction, setting a new standard for the use of advanced digital and fabrication technologies". The web-hosted, parametric, intelligently adaptable three-dimensional digital model enabled a team of over 400 people to contribute to it.&lt;ref&gt;Fondation Louis Vuitton / Gehry Partners. (2014, October 13). Retrieved May 12, 2015, from http://www.archdaily.com/555694/fondation-louis-vuitton-gehry-partners/&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest of these projects is [[Dongdaemun Design Plaza]], designed by Zaha Hadid Architects with [[Samoo Architects &amp; Engineers|Samoo]], a major [[urban development]] landmark in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. The project resulted in the 2010 designation of Seoul as the [[World Design Capital]]. The most innovative state-of-the-art fabrication techniques were used in shaping the "45,000 aluminium panels of varying sizes and curvatures". The back-lit facade, "described by the designers as 'a field of pixilation and perforation patterns'...[transforms] from a solid entity by day into an animated light show by night".&lt;ref&gt;Zaha Hadid's Dongdaemun Design Park &amp; Plaza opens in Seoul.

===Parametricism 2.0 (2015- )===
In a 2014 debate between [[Michael Hansmeyer]] and Patrik Schumacher of [[Zaha Hadid Architects|ZHA]], part of "The New How" lecture series hosted by [[Alejandro Zaera-Polo]] at [[Princeton University]] School of Architecture, Schumacher introduced "Parametricism 2.0", the "upgraded" and now fully matured "Parametricism with parameters that matter".&lt;ref&gt;Patrik Shumacher and Michael Hansmeyer - F'14 SoA Lecture Series, "The New How" (112414). (2014). Retrieved May 12, 2015, from https://vimeo.com/112854141&lt;/ref&gt; Schumacher emphasized that after two decades of cumulative build-up of knowledge and experience, Parametricism is now fully prepared to "go mainstream", fulfilling the full gamut of the societal tasks of architecture in the "organization and articulation" of the built environment, including tectonic articulation and environmental adaptation.

Examples of projects that fit the Parametricism 2.0 paradigm and are currently in the design phase include Google's California Headquarters by [[Bjarke Ingels]] ([[Bjarke Ingels Group|BIG]]) and [[Thomas Heatherwick]] (Heatherwick Studio),&lt;ref&gt;BIG and Heatherwick unveil design for Google's California HQ.

==Outlook==
Parametricism is a global architectural style that has converged rather than being invented. In Patrick Schumacher's view, parametricism is architecture's answer to our computationally powered network society, representing a paradigmatic shift in architecture after the collapse of the hegemonic style of Modernism, in response to the global shift from the Modernist era of Fordism (mass production) to the Post-Fordist era (mass customization). The style continues to evolve in an increasingly complex and fluid network of global communications. Parametricism evolves with the advancing computational design and fabrication technologies. e.g. multi-agent computational systems, genetic algorithms and robotic fabrication. However, it is imperative to state that the emergence of a new style does not occur solely as the outcome of innovation in the technological arena. "The intelligence that is able to invent and think through such correlations is prior to its computational implementation. And, to a limited extent there can be "computation without computers".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.patrikschumacher.com/Texts/On%20Parametricism_.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Apparel patterns capturing the input of a designer ==


Apparel patternmakers draft patterns based on a designer's sketch of a style. The designer gives the sketch to the '''patternmaker''', who can ask questions to determine details the designer is looking for.

Patterns may be drafted on paper or in a computer program designed for patternmaking. Most of the time, in modern American samplerooms, the patternmaker pulls an existing pattern (or block) and makes a modified copy of it to match the new style, either on paper or on computer. If it's a completely new style, the patternmaker will usually drape a rough draft in muslin fabric on a dress form, then show it to the designer to discuss any changes before transferring the markings to paper to create the pattern for cutting. Patterns may also be drafted from measurements, but this method has fallen out of use, as it's less accurate and takes longer than the other methods. Patternmakers are also asked to copy existing garments without damaging them. This is a common practice in American samplerooms.

Patternmakers have a combination of engineering and design skill. They need to be able to understand what the designer wants, and translate that into the lines of a pattern that will cause the garment to fit correctly. Ideally the pattern captures not only the fit, but also the flair intended by the designer.

Patternmaking is taught in conjunction with fashion design education, as it is vital for designers to understand the apparel development process. It is also taught as a major at certain trade schools. There are many books on the subject, but it is rare for a patternmaker to become a professional through teaching oneself. Apprenticeships are almost unheard of in modern America, but would serve well to improve the transition from student to professional status. Because this occupation is relatively unknown outside of the apparel industry, there is a serious lack of patternmakers who can accurately interpret designs in Los Angeles, and possibly other fashion capitals.

== Metal casting patterns used in foundries ==

Foundry patternmakers have historically been woodworkers with skills of a woodcarver, [[woodturner]], and cabinet maker. When an object is made from cast iron, cast aluminum or any liquified metal  the patternmaker is employed to make a wood model of the object. The original pattern has to be made slightly larger as metal shrinks when it cools and often the pattern made in puzzle like parts as the sand mold must be "rammed up" in a certain manner and the parts of the pattern must be removed from the sand mold without altering the negative space which is left behind in the sand. Pattern makers also have evolved into cutting negative spaces into blocks of steel where sheet metal will be pressed between two matching shapes. A dinner fork is a good example. 
A block of steel is made to mirror the back of the fork and a block of steel is made to mirror the top of the fork.

'''Photobatik''' is one of [[Photogram]] techniques produced by a Japanese artist [[Yoshio Machida]] in the 1990s. Photograms are produced by partial exposure and development of the entire photosensitive surface. Photobatik is "whole exposure and partial development." Machida has expanded his technique to overexposure of the photographic paper followed by only fixing the image, resulting in a pink image.

'''Photography and the Archive Research Centre''' ('''PARC''') is an organisation in [[London]] that commissions new research into [[photography]] and [[culture]], curates and produces exhibitions and publications, organises seminars, study days, symposia&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.timeout.com/london/things-to-do/the-big-conversation-martin-parr-and-grayson-perry The Big Conversation: Martin Parr and Grayson Perry ]", [[Time Out (magazine)]]. Accessed 7 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and conferences, and supervises PhD students. It is a part of [[University of the Arts London]] (UAL), is based at UAL's [[London College of Communication]] at [[Elephant &amp; Castle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/durham-business-school/university-of-london1 | accessdate = 6 July 2014 | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | title = Research to change the world}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was designated by UAL in 2003.

According to PARC's website its activities span the history and culture of photography, particularly post-war British photography, the documentation of war and conflict, the photography of fashion and style, the visualization of the counterculture and photographers as filmmakers.

'''''Saint Francis in Meditation''''' (c. 1604/06 or 1607/10), is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] master [[Caravaggio]], in the [[Museo Civico Ala Ponzone, Cremona|Museo Civico]], [[Cremona]].

This is one of two paintings of almost identical measurements showing [[Saint Francis of Assisi]] contemplating a skull (see ''[[Saint Francis in Prayer (Caravaggio)|Saint Francis in Prayer]]'') - neither is documented and both are disputed, although the dispute is as to whether they are originals or copies. The dating of both is highly uncertain, although the cypress trunk behind this Saint Francis is very reminiscent of the tree behind the Corsini ''[[John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|John the Baptist]]''. St Francis was a popular subject during the [[Counter-Reformation]], when the Church stressed - at least officially - the virtues of poverty and the imitation of Christ.

{{Literature}}
The '''sociology of literature''' is a subfield of the [[sociology of culture]]. It studies the social production of literature and its social implications. A notable example is [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s 1992  ''Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire'', translated by Susan Emanuel as ''Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field'' (1996).

==Classical sociology==

None of the 'founding fathers' of sociology produced a detailed study of literature, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of [[ideology]] has been directed at literature by [[Pierre Macherey]], [[Terry Eagleton]] and [[Fredric Jameson]]. [[Max Weber]]'s theory of modernity as cultural rationalisation, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by [[Frankfurt School]] writers such as [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]]. [[Emile Durkheim]]'s view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by [[Robert Escarpit]]. Bourdieu's work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim

==Lukács and the theory of the novel==

An important first step in the sociology of literature was taken by [[Georg Lukács]]'s ''The Theory of the Novel'', first published in German in 1916, in the ''Zeitschrift fur Aesthetik und Allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft''. In 1920 it was republished in book form and this version strongly influenced the Frankfurt School. A second edition, published in 1962, was similarly influential on French structuralism. ''The Theory of the Novel'' argued that, whilst the classical epic poem had given form to a totality of life pregiven in reality by the social integration of classical civilisation, the modern novel had become 'the epic of an age in which the extensive totality of life is no longer directly given'.&lt;ref&gt;Lukács, G. (1971). ''The Theory of the Novel: A Historico-Philosophical Essay of the Forms of Great Epic Literature'', trans. A. Bostock, London: Merlin Press, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel form is therefore organised around the problematic hero in pursuit of problematic values within a problematic world. 

Lukács's second distinctive contribution to the sociology of literature was ''The Historical Novel'', written in German but first published in Russian in 1937, which appeared in English translation in 1962. Here, Lukács argued that the early 19th century historical novel's central achievement was to represent realistically the differences between pre-capitalist past and capitalist present. This was not a matter of individual talent, but of collective historical experience, because the French Revolution and the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars had made history for the first time a mass experience.&lt;ref&gt;Lukács, G. (1962). ''The Historical Novel'', trans. H. and S. Mitchell, London: Merlin Press, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to argue that the success of the 1848 revolutions led to the decline of the historical novel into 'decorative monumentalization' and the 'making private of history'.&lt;ref&gt;Lukács, G. (1962). ''The Historical Novel'', trans. H. and S. Mitchell, London: Merlin Press, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; The key figures in the historical novel were thus those of the early 19th century, especially Sir Walter Scott.

Lukács was an important influence on [[Lucien Goldmann]]'s ''Towards a Sociology of the Novel'', Alan Swingewood's discussion of the sociology of the novel in Part 3 of Laurenson and Swingewood's ''The Sociology of Literature'' and [[Franco Moretti]]'s ''Signs Taken for Wonders''.

==The Frankfurt School==

Founded in 1923, the Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt developed a distinctive kind of 'critical sociology' indebted to Marx, Weber and Freud. Leading Frankfurt School critics who worked on literature included Adorno, [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Leo Löwenthal]]. Adorno's ''Notes to Literature'', Benjamin's ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' and Löwentahl's ''Literature and the Image of Man'' were each influential studies in the sociology of literature. Löwenthal continued this work at the University of California, Berkeley, during the 1950s.

Adorno's ''Notes to Literature'' is a collection of essays, the most influential of which is probably 'On Lyric Poetry and Society'. It argued that poetic thought is a reaction against the [[commodification]] and [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]] of modern life, citing [[Goethe]] and [[Baudelaire]] as examples.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, T.W. (1991). ''Notes to Literature'', Vol. 1, trans. S.W. Nicholson, New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 37-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin's ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' argued that the extreme 'sovereign violence' of the 16th and 17th century German 'Trauerspiel' (literally mourning play, less literally tragedy) playwrights expressed the historical realities of princely power far better than had classical tragedy.    

Habermas succeeded Adorno to the Chair of Sociology and Philosophy at Frankfurt. Habermas's first major work, ''Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit'' was published in German in 1962, and in English translation as ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere'' in 1989. It attempted to explain the socio-historical emergence of middle-class public opinion in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Developing a new kind of institutional sociology of literature, it argued that the public sphere had been organised around literary salons in France, learned and literary societies in Germany, and coffee houses in England. These institutions sustained the early novel, newspaper and periodical press.

==The sociology of the avant-garde==

Peter Bürger was Professor of French and Comparative Literature at the University of Bremen. His ''Theorie der Avantgarde'' was published in German in 1974 and in English translation in 1984. Like Habermas, Bürger was interested in the institutional sociology of literature and art. He postulated a historical typology of aesthetic social relations, measured along three main axes, the function of the artwork, its mode of production and its mode of reception.&lt;ref&gt;Bürger, P. (1984). ''Theory of the Avant-Garde'', trans. M. Shaw, Minneapolis: [[University of Minnesota Press]], pp. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt; This gave him three main kinds of art, sacral, courtly and bourgeois. Bourgeois art, he argued, had as its function individual self-understanding and was produced and received individually. It became a celebration in form of the liberation of art from religion, the court and, eventually, even the bourgeoisie. Modernist art was thus an autonomous social 'institution', the preserve of an increasingly autonomous intellectual class. The 'historical avant-garde' of the inter-war years developed as a movement within and against modernism, he concluded, as an ultimately unsuccessful revolt against precisely this autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Bürger, P. (1984). ''Theory of the Avant-Garde'', trans. M. Shaw, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Habermas adopts a very similar approach in his own account of the avant-garde.

==The sociology of the book trade==

Robert Escarpit was Professor of Comparative Literature at the University of Bordeaux and founder of the Centre for the Sociology of Literary Facts. His works included ''The Sociology of Literature'', published in French in 1958 and in English translation in 1971, and ''The Book Revolution'', published in French in 1965 and in English in 1966. In Durkheimian fashion, Escarpit aimed to concern himself only with the externally defined 'social facts' of literature, especially those registered in the book trade.&lt;ref&gt;Escarpit, R. (1971). ''The Sociolology of Literature'', trans. E. Pick, London: Cass, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; His focus fell on the 'community of writers', understood in aggregate as 'generations' and 'teams'. He extended the definition of literature to include all 'non-functional' writing and also insisted that literary success resulted from 'a convergence of intentions between author and reader'.&lt;ref&gt;Escarpit, R. (1971). ''The Sociolology of Literature'', trans. E. Pick, London: Cass, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Analogously empirical studies of the sociology of the book trade were carried out by [[Lewis Coser]] in the United States and [[Peter H. Mann]] in Britain.

[[Lucien Febvre]] and Henri-Jean Martin's ''L'Apparition du livre'', first published in French 1958 and in English translation as ''The Coming of the Book'' in 1976, is strictly speaking a work of social history (Febvre was a leading figure in the ''Annales'' School of historiography). But it is deeply sociological in character - ''Annales'' history was determinedly social scientific - and provides a systematic account of the long-run development of the European book trade (the period covered is 1450–1800).

==Genetic structuralism==

Lucien Goldmann was Director of Studies at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris and founding Director of the Centre for the Sociology of Literature at the Free University of Brussels. Like Escarpit, Goldmann was influenced by Durkheim: hence, his definition of the subject matter of sociology as the 'study of the facts of consciousness'.&lt;ref&gt;Goldmann, L. (1970). ''The Human Sciences and Philosophy'', trans. H.V. White and R. Anchor, London: Jonathan Cape, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; But he was also interested in developing a sociology of the text. The central task of the literary sociologist, he argued, was to bring out the objective meaning of the literary work by placing it in its historical context, studied as a whole. 

Goldmann defined the creating subject as transindividual, that is, as an instance of Durkheim's 'collective consciousness'. Following Marx and Lukács, however, Goldmann also assumed that group consciousness was normally class consciousnesses. The mediating agency between a social class and the work of literature then became the 'world vision', which binds the individual members of a social class together. ''Le Dieu caché'', his study of [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Jean Racine]], was published in French in 1955 and in English translation as ''The Hidden God'' in 1964. It identified 'structural homologies' between the Jansenist 'tragic vision', the textual structures of Pascal's ''Pensées'' and Racine's plays, and the social position of the seventeenth-century 'noblesse de robe'. Goldmann's structuralism was 'genetic' because it sought to trace the genesis of literary structures in extra-literary phenomena.

In 1964 Goldmann published ''Pour une Sociologie du Roman'' translated by Alan Sheridan as ''Towards a Sociology of the Novel'' in 1974. Like Lukács, Goldmann sees the novel as revolving around the problematic hero's search for authentic values in a degraded society. But Goldmann also postulates a 'rigorous homology' between the literary form of the novel and the economic form of the commodity. The early novel, he argues, is concerned with individual biography and the problematic hero, but, as competitive capitalism evolves into monopoly capitalism, the problematic hero progressively disappears. The period between the First and Second World Wars witnesses a temporary experiment with the community as collective hero: Goldmann's example is [[André Malraux]]. But the main line of development is characterised by the effort to write the novel of 'the absence of subjects'. Here, Goldmann's example is the ''nouveau roman'' of [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]] and [[Nathalie Sarraute]].  

[[Andrew Milner]]'s ''John Milton and the English Revolution'' (1981) is essentially an application of Goldmann's genetic structuralism to the study of seventeenth-century English literature.

==Sociocriticism==

Goldmann's sociology of literature remains significant in itself and as a source of inspiration, both positive and negative, to the kind of 'sociocriticism' developed by Edmond Cros, Pierre Zima and their co-workers in France and Canada.

==Neo-Marxian ideology critique==

Marx used the term ideology to denote the inner connectedness of culture, including literature, and class.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. and F. Engels (1970). ''The German Ideology'', Part 1, trans. W. Lough, C. dutt and C.P. Magill, London: Lawrence and Wishart, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher Louis Althusser elaborated on this notion in the early 1970s, arguing that ideology functions so as to constitute biological individuals as social 'subjects' by representing their imaginary relation to their real conditions of existence.&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, L. (1971). 'Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses: Notes Towards and Investigation' in ''Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays'', trans. B. Brewster, London: New Left Books.&lt;/ref&gt; 

For Althusser himself art was not ideology. But his theory was applied to literature by Macherey in France, Eagleton in Britain and Jameson in the United States. The central novelty of Eagleton's ''Criticism and Ideology'' was its argument that literature could be understood as 'producing' ideology, in the sense of performing it.&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, T. (1976). ''Criticism and Ideology'', London: New Left Books, pp. 64-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Jameson's ''The Political Unconscious'' argued that literary analysis can be focussed on three distinct levels, 'text', 'ideologeme' and 'ideology of form', each of which has its socio-historical corollary, in the equivalent 'semantic horizon' of political history, society and mode of production.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, F. (1981), ''The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act'', London: Methuen, pp. 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt; The version of ideology Jameson applies to all three levels is essentially Althusserian. The novelty of his position, however, was to argue for a 'double hermeneutic' simultaneously concerned with ideology and [[utopia]].

Macherey, Eagleton and Jameson were literary critics by profession, but their applications of ideology-critique to literature are sociological in character, insofar as they seek to explain literary phenomena in extra-literary terms.

==Bourdieu==

Bourdieu was Professor of Sociology at the Collège de France and Director of the Centre de Sociologie Européenne. His first major contribution to the sociology of literature (and other arts) was ''La Distinction'', published in French in 1979 and in English translation in 1984. It is based on detailed sociological surveys and ethnographic observation of the social distribution of cultural preferences. Bourdieu identified three main zones of taste, 'legitimate', 'middle-brow' and 'popular', which he found to be dominant respectively in the educated sections of the dominant class, the middle classes and the working classes. He described legitimate taste as centred on an 'aesthetic disposition' to assert the primacy of form over function. The 'popular aesthetic', by contrast, is based on continuity between art and life and 'a deep-rooted demand for participation'.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. (1984). ''Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste'', trans. R. Nice, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, its hostility to representations of objects that in real life are either ugly or immoral. Artistic and social 'distinction' are inextricably interrelated, he concluded, because the 'pure gaze' implies a break with ordinary attitudes towards the world and, as such, is a 'social break'.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. (1984). ''Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste'', trans. R. Nice, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Rules of Art'' is more specifically focussed on literature, especially the significance of [[Gustave Flaubert]] for the making of modern French literature. Bourdieu postulated a model of 'the field of cultural production' as structured externally in relation to the 'field of power' and internally in relation to two 'principles of hierarchization', the heteronomous and the autonomous. The modern literary and artistic field is a site of contestation between the heteronomous principle, subordinating art to economy, and the autonomous, resisting such subordination. In Bourdieu's map of the French literary field in the late nineteenth century, the most autonomous genre, that is, the least economically profitable - poetry - is to the left, whilst the most heteronomous, the most economically profitable - drama - is to the right, with the novel located somewhere in between. Additionally, higher social status audiences govern the upper end of the field and lower status audiences the lower end.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. (1996). ''The Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field'', trans. S. Emanuel, Cambridge: Polity Press, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Flaubert's distinctive achievement in ''L'Éducation sentimentale'' was, in Bourdieu's account, to have understood and defined the rules of modern autonomous art.

==The rise of the novel==

One of the earliest English-language contributions to the sociology of literature is ''The Rise of the Novel'' (1957) by Ian Watt, Professor of English at Stanford University. For Watt, the novel's 'novelty' was its 'formal realism', the idea 'that the novel is a full and authentic report of human experience'.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, I. (1963). ''The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; His paradigmatic instances are [[Daniel Defoe]], [[Samuel Richardson]] and [[Henry Fielding]]. Watt argued that the novel's concern with realistically described relations between ordinary individuals, ran parallel to the more general development of philosophical realism, middle-class economic individualism and Puritan individualism. He also argued that the form addressed the interests and capacities of the new middle-class reading public and the new book trade evolving in response to them. As tradesmen themselves, Defoe and Richardson had only to 'consult their own standards' to know that their work would appeal to a large audience.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, I. (1963). ''The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural materialism==

Raymond Williams was Professor of Drama at Cambridge University and one of the founders of contemporary cultural studies. He described his own distinctive approach as a 'cultural materialism', by which he meant a theory of culture 'as a (social and material) productive process' and of the arts 'as social uses of material means of production'.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R. (1980). ''Problems in Materialism and Culture: Selected Essays'', London: Verso, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a clearly sociological, as distinct from literary-critical, perspective: hence, its most general exposition in the United States as ''The Sociology of Culture'' and in Britain as ''Culture'', a 1981 title in Fontana's New Sociology series. Although Williams's interests ranged widely across the whole field of literary and cultural studies, his major work was concentrated on literature and drama. He was thus a sociologist of culture, specialising in the sociology of literature. 

In ''The Long Revolution'' (1961), Williams developed pioneering accounts of the sociology of the book trade, the sociology of authorship and the sociology of the novel. In ''The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence'' (1970), he argued that the modern novel articulated a distinctively modern 'structure of feeling', the key problem of which was the 'knowable community'.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R. (1974). ''The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence'', London: Chatto and Windus, pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Country and the City'' (1973) he developed a social history of English country-house poetry, aimed at demystifying the idealisations of rural life contained in the literature: 'It is what the poems are: not country life but social compliment; the familiar hyperboles of the aristocracy and its attendants'.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R. (1973). ''The Country and the City'', New York: Oxford University Press, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Marxism and Literature'' (1977) - simultaneously a critique of both Marxism and 'Literature' - is an extensive formal elaboration of Williams's own theoretical system.   

[[Alan Sinfield]]'s ''Faultlines: Cultural Materialism and the Politics of Dissident Reading'' (1992) and ''Literature, Politics and Culture in Postwar Britain'' (1997) are both clearly indebted to Williams. So, too, is Andrew Milner's ''Literature, Culture and Society'' (2005).

==World-systems theory==

Franco Moretti was, by turn, Professor of English Literature at the University of Salerno, of Comparative Literature at Verona University and of English and Comparative Literature at Stanford University. His first book, ''Signs Taken for Wonders'' (1983) was subtitled ''Essays in the Sociology of Literary Forms'' and was essentially qualitative in method. His later work, however, became progressively more quantitative. 

Applying [[Immanuel Wallerstein]]'s [[world-systems theory]] to literature, Moretti argued, in ''Atlas of the European Novel'' (1998), that the nineteenth-century literary economy had comprised 'three Europes', with France and Britain at the core, most countries in the periphery and a variable semiperiphery located in between. Measured by the volume of translations in national bibliographies, he found that French novelists were more successful in the Catholic South and British in the Protestant North, but that the whole continent nonetheless read the leading figures from both.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, F. (1998). ''Atlas of the European Novel 1800–1900'', London: Verso, pp. 174, 178-179.&lt;/ref&gt; London and Paris 'rule the entire continent for over a century', he concluded, publishing half or more of all European novels.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, F. (1998). ''Atlas of the European Novel 1800–1900'', London: Verso, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Moretti's theses prompted much subsequent controversy, collected together in Christopher Prendergast's edited collection ''Debating World Literature'' (2004). Moretti himself expanded on the argument in his ''Distant Reading'' (2013).

==Recent developments==

Building on earlier work in the production of culture, reception aesthetics and cultural capital, the sociology of literature has recently concentrated on readers' construction of meaning. New developments include studying the relationship between literature and group identities; concerning institutional and reader-response analysis; reintroducing the role of intentions of the author in literature; reconsidering the role of ethics and morality in literature &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Recovering Morality: Pragmatic Sociology and Literary Studies | journal = New Literary History | first1 = S.

The sociology of literature has also recently taken an interest in the global inequality between First-World and Third-World authors, where the latter tend to be strongly dependent on the editorial decisions of publishers in Paris, London or New York and are often excluded from participation in the global literary market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The World Republic of Letters |last1= Casanova |first1= Pascale |year= 2004 |publisher= Harvard University Press |location= Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/new_literary_history/toc/nlh.41.2.html New Literary History] devoted a special issue to new approaches to the sociology of literature in Spring 2010.

'''''The Discovery of America by Christopher Columbus''''' is the name of a painting by artist [[Salvador Dalí]], begun in 1958 and finished in 1959.&lt;ref name="transnational"/&gt; It is over 14 feet tall and over 9 feet wide (410&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;284&amp;nbsp;cm; 161.4&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;111.8&amp;nbsp;in),&lt;ref name="transnational"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transnational America: Contours of Modern US Culture|page=131
|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=8772899581|isbn=8772899581
|author1=Russell Duncan|author2=Clara Juncker|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; one in a series of large paintings Dalí did during this era.

==Description==
This work is an ambitious homage to Dalí's Spain. It combines Spanish history, religion, art, and myth into a unified whole. It was commissioned for [[Huntington Hartford]] for the opening of his Museum Gallery of Modern Art in [[New York City|New York]]'s [[2 Columbus Circle]]. At this time, some Catalan historians were claiming that Columbus was actually from Catalonia, not Italy, making the discovery all the more relevant for Dalí, who was also from this region of Spain. 

The [[eponymous]] painting deals with [[Christopher Columbus]]'s first landing in the ''[[New World]]''; it depicts the event metaphorically rather than aiming at historical accuracy.  Columbus is depicted not as a middle-aged mariner, but as an adolescent boy in a classical robe to symbolize America as a young continent with its best years ahead of it.

Dalí, in a period of intense interest in [[Roman Catholic]] mysticism at the time, symbolically portrayed Columbus bringing [[Christianity]] and the ''true church'' to a new world as a great and holy accomplishment. 

[[Gala Dalí]], the painter's wife, whom he often depicted as the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], poses for the role of The Blessed Virgin (or according to some commentators [[Helena, mother of Constantine the Great|Saint Helena]]) on the banner in the right hand of Columbus. She appears as a Saint, suggesting that she is Dalí's muse and that she is responsible for his own, "Discovery of America".

Dalí painted himself in the background as a kneeling monk holding a [[crucifix]].&lt;ref name="transnational"/&gt; Dalí's belief that Columbus was [[Catalan people|Catalan]] is represented by the incorporation of the old Catalan flag.  

The painting contains numerous references to the works of [[Diego Velázquez]] (specifically [[The Surrender of Breda]]), a [[Spain|Spanish]] painter who had died 300 years earlier, and who influenced both Dalí's painting and his [[moustache]]. Dalí borrows the spears from that painting and places them on the right hand side of his work. Within these spears, Dalí has painted the image of a crucified Christ, which was based on a drawing by the Spanish mystic, St. John.

In the bottom center of the painting, on the beach a few steps in front of Columbus, is the bumpy and pockmarked brown sphere of a [[sea urchin]] with a curious halo-like ring around it. 

==Current status==
The painting now hangs in the [[Salvador Dalí Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] which provides a permanent home for the collection of [[A. Reynolds Morse &amp; Eleanor R. Morse]].

'''The Falcon''' is a [[public house]] in [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England. It stands on the west side of Lower Bridge Street at its junction with Grosvenor Road.  The Falcon is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].&lt;ref name=images&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376292|desc= Falcon Inn, Chester|accessdate= 11 April 2015|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building formerly incorporated part of [[Chester Rows]], but it was the first building to have its portion of the row enclosed in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century.

==History==

The building originated as a house in about 1200 and was later extended to the south along Lower Bridge Street, with a great hall running parallel to the street.  During the 13th&amp;nbsp;century it was rebuilt to incorporate its portion of the row.  It was rebuilt again during the late 16th and early 17th&amp;nbsp;centuries.  The house was bought in 1602 by [[Sir Richard Grosvenor, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Grosvenor]] who extensively altered it some 40 years later to make it his [[Townhouse|town house]].  During the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] he moved his family here from his country home, [[Eaton Hall, Cheshire|Eaton Hall]].  In 1643 Sir Richard petitioned the City Assembly for leave to enlarge his house by enclosing the portion of the row which passed through his property. This was successful and it set a precedent for other residents of Lower Bridge Street to enclose their portion of the rows, or to build new structures which did not incorporate the rows.&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.virtualchester.org/view/view_location.php?id=19 | title = The Falcon | accessdate = 17 July 2009| publisher = Chester City Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th&amp;nbsp;century the building ceased to be the town house of the Grosvenor family.  It continued to be owned by them, and between 1778 and 1878 it was licensed as ''The Falcon Inn''.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;  In about 1879 alterations were made by [[John Douglas (architect)|John Douglas]]. At this time it was known as ''The Falcon Cocoa House''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Hubbard | first =Edward | authorlink = Edward Hubbard | title =The Work of John Douglas |edition= | publisher =[[The Victorian Society]] | year =1991 | location =London | page = 250| isbn =0-901657-16-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was re-opened as a [[Temperance movement|temperance house]].&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;  In 1886 [[George Enoch Grayson|Grayson]] and [[Edward Ould|Ould]] carried out a restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hartwell | first = Clare |last2 = Hyde | first2 = Matthew |last3 = Hubbard | first3 = Edward | author3-link=Edward Hubbard | last4 =Pevsner | first4 =Nikolaus | author4-link =Nikolaus Pevsner | series= The Buildings of England| title = Cheshire |edition= | publisher =[[Yale University Press]]| year =2011| origyear=1971| location =New Haven and London| page = 262| url = | doi = | id = | isbn =978-0-300-17043-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1970s the building had become virtually derelict.&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{Citation | last = Morriss| first = Richard| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | publication-date = | date = | year = 1993| title = The Buildings of Chester| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = Dover| place = | publisher = Alan Sutton| pages = | page = 23| id = | isbn = 0-7509-0255-8| doi = | oclc = | url = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 the Falcon Trust was established, and the building was donated to the trust by the [[Grosvenor Group|Grosvenor Estate]].&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;  Between 1979 and 1982 the building was restored and in 1983 it won a [[Europa Nostra]] award.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;  The building was donated to the Falcon Trust by the [[Grosvenor Group|Grosvenor Estate]], and was reopened by the [[Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster|Duke of Westminster]] in May 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor1-last= Langtree|editor1-first= Stephen|editor2-last= Comyns|editor2-first= Alan| year = 2001| title = 2000 Years of Building: Chester's Architectural Legacy| publication-place = Chester| place = | publisher = Chester Civic Trust| pages = 64–65| page = | format = | id = | isbn = 0-9540152-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The east face of The Falcon is on Lower Bridge Street and the north face on Grosvenor Road.  The east face has two storeys on a [[sandstone]] plinth with two [[gable]]s.  Most of the sandstone is [[Stucco|rendered]].  To the left is a staircase of nine steps leading from the street to the lower storey, which is the level of the enclosed row.  The lower storey has [[Close studding|close timber studding]] and an eleven-light leaded window.  Above this is a row of twelve [[quatrefoil]] panels which slope slightly outwards over which is a continuous 34-light leaded window.  The two gables are carried on brackets which curve outwards, and have herringbone [[strut]]s, [[Molding (decorative)|moulded]] [[bargeboard]]s and shaped [[finial]]s.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

The north face give the appearance of two buildings.  The older part is to the left (east) and the newer right (west) part was possibly added by Sir Richard Grosvenor in 1626.  The eastern portion is a continuation of the east front.  The street level and the lower storey are in sandstone, partly rendered, some of which has been replaced by brick.  The upper storey has a window of six lights, which are continuous with those on the east face and two quatrefoils above.  To the right of these is timber framing and a window.  Above is a grey slate roof and a lateral shaped chimney in brick.  The western portion has a rendered [[plinth]] with timber framing above.  On the lower storey is a door and two windows, one with seven lights and the other with four.  The upper storey has similar windows, plus a one-light window over the door.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

===Interior===
The medieval undercroft is used as the beer cellar.  It was originally a single three-bay chamber but has been divided by a [[Brick|brick wall]] into a two-bay north chamber and a single-bay south chamber.  In the cellar are two octagonal stone [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] and a massive central east-west oak beam.  On the level of the row is a room along the east side, which is the enclosed portion of the row, and two rooms behind, with a further room in the west wing.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

'''''The Glo Friends''''' is a [[television series]] based on the [[Glo Friends]] toyline, originally aired in 1986 as a segment of ''[[My Little Pony (TV series)|My Little Pony 'n Friends]]'', that only lasted one season (26 segments were made in total). ''[[My Little Pony (TV series)|My Little Pony]]'' aired the first 15 minutes, and the second half rotated among ''[[MoonDreamers]]'', ''[[Potato Head Kids]]'', and ''Glo Friends''. The show was made by [[Sunbow Entertainment|Sunbow Productions]] and [[Marvel Productions]]. It rebroadcast on [[Freeform (TV channel)|(CBN) Family Channel]] (known today as Freeform) from 1989 to 1995 during ''[[My Little Pony (TV series)|My Little Pony]]''.

The Glo Friends toyline, which preceded the television show, are small [[phosphorescence|glow-in-the-dark]] toys in the shape of [[insect]]s and other small creatures (including the original [[Glo Worm]]) that were made by [[Hasbro]]'s [[Playskool]] division in the mid-1980s ([[Glo Worm]] was introduced in 1982). Books were also made by [[Ladybird Books|Ladybird]] to accompany each Glo Friend.

==Premise==
The title protagonists in ''The Glo Friends'' were a community of small, glow-in-the-dark bugs that live in Glo Land, a magical kingdom located in the middle of a forest. Their homes are built near the Glo Pond, from where they harvest a substance known as Moondrops. It is Moondrops that sustain the Glo Friends and enable their ability to glow in the dark.

The Glo Friends peaceful existence is threatened constantly by the Moligans, a group of [[Mole (animal)|mole]]-like creatures led by Starnose. The Moligans were banished from the kingdom of Moleslavia by King Mole for various crimes including unlawful digging, mob action, robbery, looting and cheating. Since their banishment, the Moligans have been living underground and planning revenge against King Mole. Since the Moligans are [[Myopia|short-sighted]], they were unsuccessful in harvesting gold from the nearby mines. As such, the Moligans have attempted to enslave the Glo Friends to power their lanterns, which would enable them to see in the mines, harvest the gold and buy out the kingdom of Moleslavia.

==Characters==

===Glo Friends===
* '''Baby Glo Worm''' (voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]]) - She is the youngest member of the Glo Friends community. She is seen spending most of her time along Glo Grannybug (see below). She is quite curious and often giggles. She also speaks, but only in short sentences. In the debut episode of the Glo Friends TV show ''Baby Glo Worm goes Bye-Bye'', she escaped from her bed while the other Glo Friends were trying to sing a lullaby to make her sleep, and consequently got lost in the Moligans´ Tunnels, putting the other Glo Friends into trouble when they set off to find her.
* '''Garden [[Ant]]''' - He spends his time taking care of his plants and flowers. He cultivates vegetables for the Glo Friend community, and has a vast knowledge about them. He can't tolerate seeing the Moligans eating the roots of a tree, as seen in the episodes ''Forest Brigade'' (in which he protects his personal tree) and even in ''Easy Money'' Pt. 2 when a Moleslavian villager is selling "Root dogs" (like Hot Dogs with roots instead of sausages). He is a regular character in the TV series. His house is a sort of pumpkin located in Glo Land.
** '''Bunny Rabbit''' - A [[rabbit]] who is Garden Ant's best friend.
* '''Glo Bashfulbug''' - As her name indicates, Glo Bashfulbug is a female Glo Friend that doesn't know what to say in certain moments. Sometimes, she shows an attraction for Glo Worm, one of the bravest and smartest Glo Friends. In more than one moment, she said to Glo Worm that being brave is hard. She is a regular character in the TV series.
* '''Glo [[Bed bug|Bedbug]]''' - She is the laziest of the Glo Friends. The only things she usually wants to do is eating, singing, and sleeping. Sometimes, she plays.
* '''Glo Bonnie [[Beetle]]''' - She is another female Glo Friend. According to her description, she is very sweet. She doesn't appear in the TV series.
* '''Glo Bookbug''' -
* '''Glo Bopbug''' - He is an eight-legged Glo Friend that wears a top hat and shoes, and uses a cane. He is a regular character in the TV series. He likes to dance. In the Spanish dub of the show, he was called "Abuelete", literally translated as "Granddaddy"
* '''Glo [[Butterfly]]''' - She carries a magic wand. She believes that she can do magic tricks, although she actually can't. In the episode ''Make no mistake, it's magic'', the other Glo Friends said that it is better not to tell her that her "magic tricks" are just coincidences, in order to keep her happy.
* '''Glo Bug''' (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) - He is sometimes considered the bravest of the Glo Friends. He is not afraid of danger. For example, in the first part of ''The Quest'', he can't tolerate that Rook and the Red Ant army are destroying the forest and for that reason, without wasting time thinking, he dares to run into Rook and face him. For some reason, in the TV series and in his Playskool-Hasbro figure, his hat is pink, while in other media, such as the Ladybird books, his hat has multicoloured strips.
* '''Glo Cappy''' (voiced by [[Russi Taylor]]) - He loves going to explore the forests riding on Country Mouse and acts as a reporter of Glo Land. He informs the others about the dangers or anything worth to mention. He and his friend wear a blue cap.
** '''Country Mouse''' - A [[mouse]] who is Glo Cappy's best friend.
* '''Glo Clutterbug''' - He is a clumsy insect that usually messes up the situation, and puts the other Glo Friends into trouble. He often falls into traps.
* '''Glo [[Cricket (insect)|Cricket]]''' -
* '''Glo Doodlebug''' (voiced by [[Will Ryan]]) - He loves art. He often gets frustrated when he feels that his artworks or his painting style are not appreciated. In the episode "The Masterpiece," Glo Doodlebug decides to leave Glo Land in order to go to a cave (accompanied by Snugbug) that he uses as a personal studio. He is a regular character in the TV series.
* '''Glo [[Firefly]]''' - He has a name that has double-meaning: his job is being a [[firefighter]] and he is a firefly. He doesn't appear in the TV series.
* '''Glo Flutterbug''' - His figure was only available through mail order as Glo Prayerbug. He doesn't appear in the TV series.
* '''Glo Grannybug''' - She is the wisest and oldest Glo Friend. She lives in the biggest treehouse of Glo Land. She often tells stories to the other Glo Friends and she is often seen taking care of Baby Glo Worm. She also loves celebrating parties with homemade food at the Full Moon Days, in which Moondrops falls to the Earth, as seen for examples in the episode "Beware the Tales of Gold."
* '''Glo Hopper''' - He is a green-bodied [[grasshopper]] who is usually seen riding on Glo Turtle. He tends to jump high under several circumstances, including surprise, happiness, etc.
** '''Glo Turtle''' - A [[turtle]] who is Glo Hopper's best friend.
* '''Glo [[Horse-fly|Horsefly]]''' -
* '''Glo Nuttybug''' -
* '''Glo Prayerbug''' - She is a blue [[mantis]]-shaped Glo Friend that, as her name indicates, prays when something goes wrong. She appeared very few times in the TV show (only in the 10-part adventure ''The Quest'' and in ''The Glo Friends save Christmas'' special) and she had only very few lines. Her toy figure was only available in the US and Canada by mail order.
* '''Glo Scuttlebug''' (voiced by [[Mona Marshall]]) - He is a skypilot that rides on Dragonflyer. He is a regular character in the TV series.
** '''Dragonflyer''' - A [[dragonfly]] who is Glo Shuttlebug's best friend that acts as a plane.
* '''Glo Skunkbug''' - He is a stinking Glo Friend with purple nose (Most of the other Glo Friends have a red nose). He is a very close friend of Glo Clutterbug.
* '''Glo Sluggerbug''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) - He wears a baseball cap and always carry a stick. He is very brave and in several moments he and his frog friend have excellent ideas when fighting against their enemies. He is a regular character in the TV series. The only moment in which he was seen playing a baseball match with the other Glo Friends was in the episode ''Bean Ball''.
** '''Bullyfrog''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) - A [[American bullfrog|bullfrog]] who is Glo Sluggerbug's best friend.
* '''Glo [[Snail]]''' (voiced by [[Don Messick]]) -
* '''Glo Sniffles Snail''' - He has a constant cold. He doesn't appear in the TV series.
* '''Glo Snugbug''' - She is a pink caterpillar-shaped Glo Friend. She is not a regular character in the TV series. She only appeared during the 10-part episode ''The Quest'' and ''The Masterpiece'', in which she seemed to show feelings for Glo Doodlebug. She tends to hug all his friends.
* '''Glo [[Spider]]''' -
* '''Glo Tootlebug''' -
* '''Glo [[Nepomorpha|Waterbug]]''' - Glo Waterbug is a sailor insect. He guards the Glo Moondrops Pond with Dipper Duck.
** '''Dipper Ducky''' (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) - A [[duck]] who is Glo Waterbug's best friend. He guards Glo Moondrops Pond with Dipper Duck.
* '''Glo Worm''' (voiced by [[Pat Fraley]]) - He is the original Glo Friend, and is the unofficial leader of the Glo Friends in the TV series. He is quite brave and smart. He wears purple pyjamas, although the original [[Glo Worm]] toy portrays him as wearing green pyjamas. This was a source of some controversy.

===Glo Wees===
A race of [[Fairy|fairies]] that can glow like the Glo Friends. They are known to be nature's helpers:

* '''Dapple''' -
* '''Nippin''' -
* '''Nutcap''' (voiced by [[Hal Rayle]]) - A Glo Wee that carries around the Book of Nature which enables him to communicate with nature.
* '''Posey''' (voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]]) -
* '''Spruce''' - A Glo Wee who is an expert juggler.
* '''Willow''' - A Glo Wee who conducts the symphony of nature.

===Villains===
* '''Moligans''' - The Moligans are the primary antagonists of the series. After being banished from Moleslavia for their crimes, they sought to start their mine and mine for gold in order to get enough to buy out Moleslavia. To accomplish this, they always try to target the Glo Friends to power their lanterns with no success.
** '''Starnose''' (voiced by [[Roger C. Carmel]]) - Starnose is the leader of the Moligans. He is physically tough and it is mentioned that he is able to scare anyone who tries to ignore his orders. In the Spanish dub of the Glo Friends TV Show, he was called "Narizotas", literally translated as "Big Nose".
** '''Nails''' (voiced by [[Susan Silo]]) - Nails is a selfish and egocentrical Moligan lady that only worries about her physical appearance or anything in her own benefit. She likes valuable and shining body complements (such as rings, necklaces, earrings, bracelets, etc.) and she doesn't tolerate that anyone calls her an "ugly witch" (or similar attributions). She seems to have an attraction to Starnose, and can often be seen clinging to him, but that may just be her trying to get close to the main power of the group. She also serves as the [[Cook (profession)|cook]] of the Moligans as seen in "Wizard of Rook."
** '''Old Moldy''' (voiced by [[Roger C. Carmel]]) - As his name indicates, Old Moldy is the oldest Moligan in the group. He needs to use a hammer-shape cane due to his old age and has seen a lot of things in his youth. Since he was young, his main dream was to melt a piece of gold to turn it in a huge river of gold. In the episode "Caverns of Mystery," his old mine was seen.
** '''Excavator''' (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) - Excavator is the second oldest Moligan in the group. He is a [[scientist]] that usually remains in his personal laboratory doing chemical experiments or inventing new mining artifacts such as the Bi-Pedal Turbo Tunneler (seen in two episodes of the TV show). In the Spanish dub of the TV series, he was called "Inventor".
** '''Brasher''' (voiced by [[Hal Rayle]]) - Brasher is a tall and intellectual Moligan. It is said that he has the best ideas about how to get the gold and the Glo Friends, but Starnose hears and takes them as they were of his own to consider himself as the "main brain of the Moligans".
** '''Smasher''' (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) - Smasher is Brasher's brother. Unlike Brasher, Smasher is (or acts as) stupid and dumb. Physically, he is tall and tough. He feels the need of "smashing" at least one Glo Friend (during the 10-part episode ''The Quest'', he is seen several times trying to damage the Glo Friends in order to force them to work for the Moligans).
** '''Scoop''' (voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]]) - Scoop is the youngest Moligan. She is also the only nice Moligan, often secretly sabotaging Starnose's plots, and is friends with the Glo Friends, but fears to leave the Moligans. She wears tight clothing and has a tall auburn hairdo and a braided ponytail.
** '''Tumbler''' - Tumbler is the shortest Moligan. He is also lazy, doing as little digging as possible, and is very gullible, often taking throwaway comments at face value.
* '''Rook''' (voiced by [[Hal Rayle]]) - Rook is a [[Corvus (genus)|crow]] who used to work for Lord Driver of the Red Ant Army. After Driver left, the Moligans enlisted Rook as a spy and lookout. He has little love for his employers, once even dishing out the dirt on them to the Glo Friends newspaper.
* '''The Red [[Ant]] Army''' - They are a group of insects in a desert valley and Rook's former employers. They are led by '''Lord Driver''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]). They only appeared in "The Quest" in which they captured the Moligans and Glo Friends. It was because of them that the Moligans learned of the Glo Friends and their illumination abilities. Due to a breakout of the Moligans and the Glo Friends, Lord Driver and the Red Ant Army took flight when their kingdom ended up having a cave-in.
* '''Blanche''' (voiced by [[Sally Struthers]]) – The Wicked [[Witchcraft|Witch]] of the North Pole. Dressed in purple fur, she appears on the Christmas special along with her live [[weasel]] furry scarf (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) and had an icicle wand. She trapped [[Santa Claus]] and his DearDeers ([[reindeer]]) in an ice cage in a plot to stop Christmas.
===Others===
* '''The Jester brothers''' (voiced by unknown) – They are pink court jesters for the Red Ant Army. The Jester brothers are just Gag characters and they only appeared in the episode: "The Quest" and "Easy Money part 1 &amp; 2".

'''''The Mocking of Christ''''' (German: '''''Die Verspottung Christi''''') is an early oil on wood painting (1503–1505) by [[Matthias Grünewald]]. It is located today in the [[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]].

== Description ==
Christ sits blindfolded on a low stone wall. His hands and arms are bound with a rope. A torturer who pulls on the rope stands before him, with his back turned to the viewer. Another stands behind Christ and tugs on his hair and has raised his fist to strike him. On the right a man with a staff in his left hand and with his other holds back the second torturer, who appears not to notice him.

An older man faces the man with the staff, and lays his hands upon the latter's shoulders, and appears to be conversing with him. In the background are three further men: on the left a musician who plays a flute with one hand while beating a small drum with the other, a youth near the center of the image, and an older man on the right.

'''Vernacular architecture''' is an [[architectural style]] that is designed based on local needs, availability of [[construction material]]s and reflecting local traditions. Traditionally, vernacular architecture did not use formally-schooled [[architect]]s, but relied on the design skills and tradition of local builders, who were rarely given any attribution for the work. However, since the late 19th century many professional architects have worked in this style and interest in vernacular architecture now forms part of a broader interest in sustainable design.

Vernacular architecture can be contrasted against [[polite architecture]] which is characterized by stylistic elements of design intentionally incorporated for aesthetic purposes which go beyond a building's functional requirements. This article also covers the term '''traditional architecture''', which exists somewhere between the two extremes yet still is based upon authentic themes.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term [[wikt:vernacular|vernacular]] is derived from the [[Latin]] ''vernaculus'', meaning "domestic, native, indigenous"; from ''verna'', meaning "native [[slave]]" or "home-born slave". The word probably derives from an older [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=vernacular|title=Vernacular|publisher=online etymology dictionary|accessdate=2007-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/wotd/wotd.pl?word=vernacular|publisher=yourdictionary.com|title=Vernacular(noun)|accessdate=2007-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020608/windows/roots.htm|title=Fiddling with words, again!|date=June 8, 2002|publisher=Tribune India|accessdate=2007-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is borrowed from [[linguistics]], where vernacular refers to language use particular to a time, place or group. In architecture, it refers to that type of architecture which is [[Indigenous knowledge|indigenous]] to a specific time or place (not imported or copied from elsewhere). It is most often applied to [[residential]] buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/vernacular Dictionary.com definition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=88049&amp;dict=CALD Cambridge advanced learner's dictionary definition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/vernacular Merriam–Webster definition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The terms [[vernacular]], [[Folk culture|folk]], [[traditional]], and [[wikt:popular|popular]] architecture are sometimes used synonymously. However, Allen Noble wrote a lengthy discussion of these terms in ''Traditional Buildings: A Global Survey of Structural Forms and Cultural Functions'' where he presents scholarly opinions that folk building or ''folk architecture'' is built by "persons not professionally trained in building arts"; where ''vernacular architecture'' is still ''of the common people'' but may be built by trained professionals such as through an [[apprenticeship]], but still using local, traditional designs and materials. ''Traditional architecture'' is architecture is passed down from person to person, generation to generation, particularly orally, but at any level of society, not just by common people. Noble discourages use of the term ''primitive architecture'' as having a negative connotation.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, Allen George. ''Traditional buildings: a global survey of structural forms and cultural functions''. London: I. B. Tauris, 2007. 1-17. Print.{{ISBN|9781845113056}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term popular architecture is used more in eastern Europe and is synonymous with folk or vernacular architecture.&lt;ref&gt;The meanings in this paragraph are supported by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009. Vernacular, a. and n., 6.; Folk 2. a.; Tradition, n., 4. a.; Traditional, a. (n.), 1. a.; Popular, a.(n.), 2. a.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Ronald Brunskill]] has defined the ultimate in vernacular architecture as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...a building designed by an amateur without any training in design; the individual will have been guided by a series of conventions built up in his locality, paying little attention to what may be fashionable. The function of the building would be the dominant factor, aesthetic considerations, though present to some small degree, being quite minimal. Local materials would be used as a matter of course, other materials being chosen and imported quite exceptionally.&lt;ref&gt;Brunskill, 2000 pages 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The vernacular architecture is not to be confused with so-called "traditional" architecture, though there are links between the two. Traditional architecture also includes buildings which bear elements of [[polite design]]: [[temples]] and [[palaces]], for example, which normally would not be included under the rubric of "vernacular." In architectural terms, 'the vernacular' can be contrasted with '[[the polite]]', which is characterised by stylistic elements of design intentionally incorporated by a professional [[architect]] for aesthetic purposes which go beyond a building's functional requirements. Between the extremes of the wholly vernacular and the completely polite, examples occur which have some vernacular and some polite content,&lt;ref&gt;Brunskill, 2000, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; often making the differences between the vernacular and the polite a matter of degree.
[[File:TraditionalArchitectureTurzaLaRioja.jpg|thumb|Dwelling of [[half-timbered]] construction on stone foundation, [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], Spain]]
The ''Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World'' defines vernacular architecture as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...comprising the dwellings and all other buildings of the people. Related to their environmental contexts and available resources they are customarily owner- or community-built, utilizing traditional technologies. All forms of vernacular architecture are built to meet specific needs, accommodating the values, economies and ways of life of the cultures that produce them.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World'', volume 1, page not cited&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Vernacular architecture is a broad, [[grassroots]] concept which encompasses fields of architectural study including aboriginal, indigenous, ancestral, rural, and ethnic architecture&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vernaculararchitecture.com/{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, a site which is part of http://www.ethnoarchitecture.org/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507021335/http://ethnoarchitecture.org/ |date=2013-05-07 }} accessed 5/2/2013&lt;/ref&gt; and is contrasted with the more intellectual architecture called polite, formal, or academic architecture just as [[folk art]] is contrasted with [[fine art]].
&lt;!--Better to keep this concise and include in country specific sections as article is expanded. In Japan, for example, not all pre-modern architecture is "vernacular," which would usually refer only to rural buildings and [[structures]]. In the [[US]], vernacular architecture might refer to a so-called craftsman [[bungalow]], fashionable in the nineteenth century, even though the bungalow as an architectural form did not originate in the US. "Vernacular" might even refer to a building like the 1848 Duncan House in [[Cooksville]], [[Wisconsin]]. --&gt;

Architecture designed by professional architects is usually not considered to be vernacular. Indeed, it can be argued that the very process of consciously designing a building makes it not vernacular. [[Paul Oliver]], in his book ''Dwellings'', states: "...it is contended that 'popular architecture' designed by professional architects or commercial builders for popular use, does not come within the compass of the vernacular".&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oliver |first1=Paul |authorlink1=Paul Oliver |title=Dwellings |url= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2003 |origyear= |publisher=Phaidon Press |location=London |isbn=0-7148-4202-8 |page= |pages= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} Oliver also offers the following simple definition of vernacular architecture: ''"the architecture of the people, and by the people, but not for the people."&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"/&gt;{{rp|14}}

[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] described vernacular architecture as "Folk building growing in response to actual needs, fitted into environment by people who knew no better than to fit them with native feeling".&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"/&gt;{{rp|9}} suggesting that it is a primitive form of design, lacking intelligent thought, but he also stated that it was "for us better worth study than all the highly self-conscious academic attempts at the beautiful throughout Europe".

[[File:Velika planina 031.JPG|thumbnail|right|A post-World War II dwelling at the [[Big Pasture Plateau]], [[Slovenia]], designed by the architect [[Vlasto Kopač]] and based on the vernacular architecture of this mountainous area.]]

Since at least the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], many modern architects have studied vernacular buildings and claimed to draw inspiration from them, including aspects of the vernacular in their designs. In 1946, the [[Egypt]]ian architect [[Hassan Fathy]] was appointed to design the town of [[New Gourna]] near [[Luxor]]. Having studied traditional [[Nubian people|Nubian]] settlements and technologies, he incorporated the traditional mud brick vaults of the Nubian settlements in his designs. The experiment failed, due to a variety of social and economic reasons, but is the first recorded attempt by an architect to address the social and environmental requirements of building users by adopting the methods and forms of the vernacular.&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"/&gt;{{rp|11}}

In 1964 the exhibition ''Architecture Without Architects'' was put on at the [[Museum of Modern Art, New York]] by [[Bernard Rudofsky]]. Accompanied by a book of the same title, including black-and-white photography of vernacular buildings around the world, the exhibition was extremely popular. It was Rudofsky who first made use of the term vernacular in an architectural context, and brought the concept into the eye of the public and of mainstream architecture: "For want of a generic label we shall call it vernacular, anonymous, spontaneous, indigenous, rural, as the case may be."&lt;ref name=Rudofsky&gt;Rudofsky, ''Architecture Without Architects'', page 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the emergence of the term in the 1970s, vernacular considerations have played an increasing part in architectural designs, although individual architects had widely varying opinions of the merits of the vernacular.

Sri Lankan architect [[Geoffrey Bawa]] is considered the pioneer of regional modernism in [[South Asia]]. Along with him, modern proponents of the use of the vernacular in architectural design include [[Charles Correa]], a well known Indian architect; [[Muzharul Islam]] and [[Bashirul Haq]], internationally known [[List of Bangladeshi architects|Bangladeshi architects]]; [[Balkrishna Doshi]], another Indian, who established the Vastu-Shilpa Foundation in [[Ahmedabad]] to research the vernacular architecture of the region; and [[Sheila Sri Prakash]] who has used rural Indian architecture as an inspiration for innovations in environmental and socio-economically sustainable design and planning. The Dutch architect [[Aldo van Eyck]] was also a proponent of vernacular architecture.&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"/&gt;{{rp|13}} Architects whose work exemplifies the modern take on vernacular architecture would be [[Samuel Mockbee]], [[Christopher Alexander]] and [[Paolo Soleri]].

Oliver claims that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As yet there is no clearly defined and specialized discipline for the study of dwellings or the larger compass of vernacular architecture. If such a discipline were to emerge it would probably be one that combines some of the elements of both architecture and anthropology with aspects of history and geography&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"/&gt;{{clarify|date=September 2013}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Architects have developed a renewed interest in vernacular architecture as a model for sustainable design. &lt;ref&gt;Forster, W., Heal, A. and Paradise, C.,  "The Vernacular as a Model for Sustainable Design" Chapter 14 in: W. Weber, S. Yannas, ''Lessons from Vernacular Architecture'', Routledge, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences on the vernacular==
[[File:Brgule 001.jpg|thumb|House in [[Brgule]], Serbia]]
Vernacular architecture is influenced by a great range of different aspects of human behaviour and environment, leading to differing building forms for almost every different context; even neighbouring villages may have subtly different approaches to the construction and use of their dwellings, even if they at first appear the same. Despite these variations, every building is subject to the same laws of physics, and hence will demonstrate significant similarities in [[structural engineering|structural forms]].

===Climate===
One of the most significant influences on vernacular architecture is the macro climate of the area in which the building is constructed. Buildings in cold climates invariably have high thermal mass or significant amounts of insulation. They are usually sealed in order to prevent heat loss, and openings such as windows tend to be small or non-existent. Buildings in warm climates, by contrast, tend to be constructed of lighter materials and to allow significant cross-ventilation through openings in the fabric of the building.

[[File:Múzeum kysuckej dediny-1.jpg|thumb|left|A [[log cabin]] in the region of [[Kysuce]] ([[Slovakia]]) - an example of vernacular architecture in relatively cold mountain climate using local materials ([[wood]]).]]
Buildings for a continental climate must be able to cope with significant variations in temperature, and may even be altered by their occupants according to the seasons. In hot arid and semi-arid regions, vernacular structures typically include a number of distinctive elements to provide for ventilation and temperature control. Across the middle-east, these elemens included such design features as courtyards gardens with water features, scree                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  n walls, reflected light, ''[[mashrabiya]]'' (the distinctive [[oriel window]] with timber lattice-work) and ''bad girs'' ([[Windcatcher|wind-catchers]]).&lt;ref name=archinform&gt;{{archINFORM|arch|10796}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Queenslander home, Australia.jpg|thumb|Queenslander, Australia]]
Buildings take different forms depending on precipitation levels in the region – leading to dwellings on stilts in many regions with frequent flooding or rainy monsoon seasons. For example, the [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] is an elevated weatherboard house with a sloped, tin roof that evolved in the early 19th-century as a solution to the annual flooding caused by monsoonal rain in Australia's northern states.&lt;ref name="LinOsb"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Osborne|first1=Lindy|title=Sublime design: the Queenslander|url=http://www.architectureanddesign.com.au/features/comment/sublime-design-the-queenslander|website=Architecture &amp; Design|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat roofs are rare in areas with high levels of precipitation. Similarly, areas with high winds will lead to specialised buildings able to cope with them, and buildings tend to present minimal surface area to prevailing winds and are often situated low on the landscape to minimise potential storm damage.

Climatic influences on vernacular architecture are substantial and can be extremely complex. Mediterranean vernacular, and that of much of the Middle East, often includes a courtyard with a fountain or pond; air cooled by water mist and evaporation is drawn through the building by the natural ventilation set up by the building form. Similarly, Northern African vernacular often has very high thermal mass and small windows to keep the occupants cool, and in many cases also includes chimneys, not for fires but to draw air through the internal spaces. Such specializations are not designed, but learned by trial and error over generations of building construction, often existing long before the scientific theories which explain why they work. Vernacular Architecture is also used for the purposes of local citizens.

===Culture===
The way of life of building occupants, and the way they use their shelters, is of great influence on building forms. The size of family units, who shares which spaces, how food is prepared and eaten, how people interact and many other cultural considerations will affect the layout and size of dwellings.

For example, the family units of several East African ethnic communities live in family compounds, surrounded by marked boundaries, in which separate single-roomed dwellings are built to house different members of the family. In polygamous communities there may be separate dwellings for different wives, and more again for sons who are too old to share space with the women of the family. Social interaction within the family is governed by, and privacy is provided by, the separation between the structures in which family members live. By contrast, in Western Europe, such separation is accomplished inside one dwelling, by dividing the building into separate rooms.

Culture also has a great influence on the appearance of vernacular buildings, as occupants often decorate buildings in accordance with local customs and beliefs.

====Nomadic dwellings====
[[File:cempa stilthouses.jpg|thumb|Stilt houses in Cempa, located in the [[Lingga Islands]] of Indonesia.]]
[[File:Yurt-construction-2.JPG|thumb|A [[Yurt]] or ger, a circular dwelling from [[Mongolia]], during erection]]
[[File:igloo.jpg|thumb|An unfinished [[Igloo]], an [[Inuit]] winter dwelling]]
There are many cultures around the world which include some aspect of nomadic life, and they have all developed vernacular solutions for the need for shelter. These all include appropriate responses to climate and customs of their inhabitants, including practicalities of simple construction such as [[Hut (dwelling)|huts]], and if necessary, transport such as [[tent]]s.

The [[Inuit]] people have a number of different forms of shelter appropriate to different seasons and geographical locations, including the [[igloo]] (for winter) and the [[tupiq]] (for summer). The [[Sami people|Sami]] of Northern Europe, who live in climates similar to those experienced by the Inuit, have developed different shelters appropriate to their culture&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"/&gt;{{rp|25}} including the [[lavvu]] and [[goahti]]. The development of different solutions in similar circumstances because of cultural influences is typical of vernacular architecture.

Many nomadic people use materials common in the local environment to construct temporary dwellings, such as the Punan of Sarawak who use palm fronds, or the Ituri Pygmies who use saplings and mongongo leaves to construct domed huts. Other cultures reuse materials, transporting them with them as they move. Examples of this are the tribes of Mongolia, who carry their [[yurt|gers]] (yurts) with them, or the black desert tents of the Qashgai in [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"/&gt;{{rp|29}} Notable in each case is the significant impact of the availability of materials and the availability of pack animals or other forms of transport on the ultimate form of the shelters.

All the shelters are adapted to suit the local climate. The Mongolian gers (yurts), for example, are versatile enough to be cool in hot continental summers and warm in the sub-zero temperaturs of Mongolian winters, and include a close-able ventilation hole at the centre and a chimney for a stove. A ger is typically not often relocated, and is therefore sturdy and secure, including wooden front door and several layers of coverings. A traditional [[Berbers|Berber]] tent, by contrast, might be relocated daily, and is much lighter and quicker to erect and dismantle – and because of the climate it is used in, does not need to provide the same degree of protection from the elements.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Permanent dwellings====
[[File:Lesotho Slide Show (294).JPG|thumb|A Southern African rondavel (or banda)]]

The type of structure and materials used for a dwelling vary depending on how permanent it is. Frequently moved nomadic structures will be lightweight and simple, more permanent ones will be less so. When people settle somewhere permanently, the architecture of their dwellings will change to reflect that.

Materials used will become heavier, more solid and more durable. They may also become more complicated and more expensive, as the capital and labour required to construct them is a one-time cost. Permanent dwellings often offer a greater degree of protection and shelter from the elements. In some cases however, where dwellings are subjected to severe weather conditions such as frequent flooding or high winds, buildings may be deliberately "designed" to fail and be replaced, rather than requiring the uneconomical or even impossible structures needed to withstand them. The collapse of a relatively flimsy, lightweight structure is also less likely to cause serious injury than a heavy structure.

Over time, dwellings' architecture may come to reflect a very specific geographical locale.

===Environment, construction elements and materials===
The local environment and the construction materials it can provide, govern many aspects of vernacular architecture. Areas rich in trees will develop a wooden vernacular, while areas without much wood may use mud or stone. In early California [[Cupressaceae|redwood]] water towers supporting redwood tanks and enclosed by redwood siding [[Tankhouse|(tankhouses)]] were part of a self-contained wind-powered domestic water system. In the Far East it is common to use bamboo, as it is both plentiful and versatile. Vernacular, almost by definition, is sustainable, and will not exhaust the local resources. If it is not sustainable, it is not suitable for its local context, and cannot be vernacular.

Construction elements and materials frequently found in vernacular buildings include:
* [[Adobe]] - a type of mud brick, often covered with white-wash, commonly used in Spain and Spanish colonies
* [[Windcatcher|Bad girs]] -a type of chimney used to provide natural ventilation, commonly found in Iran, Iraq and other parts of the Middle-East
* [[Cob (material)|Cob]] - a type of plaster made from subsoil with the addition of fibrous material to give added strength
* [[Mashrabiya]] - (also known as shanashol in Iraq) - a type of oriel window with timber lattice-work, designed to allow ventilation, commonly found in Iraq and Egypt in upper-class homes
* [[Mudbrick|Mud brick]]s - loam or sand mixed with water and vegetable matter such as straw
* [[Rammed earth]] often used in foundations
* [[Thatching|Thatch]] - dry vegetation used as roofing material
* [[Wychert]] - a blend of white earth and clay

==Literature==
Following the eclipse by [[International Modernism]] of turn-of-the 20th century vernacular-inspired British and American [[Arts and Crafts]] buildings and European [[National Romanticism]], an early work in the renewed defense of vernacular was [[Bernard Rudofsky]]'s 1964 book ''[[Architecture Without Architects|Architecture Without Architects: a short introduction to non-pedigreed architecture]]'', based on his [[MoMA]] exhibition.  The book was a reminder of the legitimacy and "hard-won knowledge" inherent in vernacular buildings, from [[Wieliczka|Polish salt-caves]] to gigantic [[Syria]]n water wheels to [[Morocco|Moroccan]] desert fortresses, and was considered [[iconoclastic]] at the time.  Rudofsky was, however, very much a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] who viewed native populations in a historical bubble of contentment.  Rudofsky's book was also based largely on [[photographs]] and not on on-site study.

A more nuanced work is the ''[[Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World]]'' edited in 1997 by [[Paul Oliver]] of the Oxford Institute for [[Sustainable Development]]. Oliver argues that vernacular architecture, given the insights it gives into issues of environmental adaptation, will be necessary in the future to "ensure sustainability in both cultural and economic terms beyond the short term." [[Christopher Alexander]], in his book ''[[A Pattern Language]]'', attempted to identify adaptive features of traditional architecture that apply across cultures. [[Howard Davis (architect)|Howard Davis]]'s book ''[[The Culture of Building]]'' details the culture that enabled several vernacular traditions.

Some extend the term vernacular to include any architecture outside the [[academic]] mainstream. The term "commercial vernacular", popularized in the late 1960s by the publication of [[Robert Venturi]]'s "Learning from Las Vegas", refers to 20th-century American [[suburban]] tract and commercial architecture. There is also the concept of an "industrial vernacular" with its emphasis on the [[aesthetics]] of [[Workshop|shops]], [[automobile repair shop|garages]] and [[factories]]. Some have linked vernacular with "off-the-shelf" aesthetics. In any respect, those who study these types of vernaculars hold that the low-end characteristics of this aesthetic define a useful and fundamental approach to architectural design.

Among those who study vernacular architecture are those who are interested in the question of everyday life and those lean toward questions of [[sociology]]. In this, many were influenced by [[The Practice of Everyday Life]] (1984) by [[Michel de Certeau]].

==Humanitarian response==
[[File:Sutyagin house 1.JPG|thumb|"[[Sutyagin House]]", a wooden single-family house – declared illegal by the city of [[Arkhangelsk]] because of the fire hazard]]
An appreciation of vernacular architecture is increasingly seen as vital in the immediate response to [[disasters]] and the following construction of [[transitional shelter]] if it is needed. The work [https://web.archive.org/web/20071008030543/http://www.sheltercentre.org/shelterlibrary/publications/112.htm Transitional Settlement: Displaced Populations], produced by [http://www.sheltercentre.org/ Shelter Centre] covers the use of vernacular in [[humanitarian]] response and argues its importance.

The value of housing displaced people in shelters which are in some way familiar is seen to provide reassurance and comfort following often very traumatic times. As the needs change from saving lives to providing medium to long term shelter the construction of locally appropriate and accepted housing can be very important.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6202363.stm "NGOs criticise tsunami shelters"] ''BBC News'' – 22 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal aspects==
As many jurisdictions introduce tougher [[building code]]s and [[zoning]] regulations, "folk architects" sometimes find themselves in conflict with the local authorities.

A case that made news in Russia was that of an [[Arkhangelsk]] entrepreneur Nikolay P. Sutyagin, who built what was reportedly the world's tallest single-family wooden house for himself and his family, only to see it condemned as a fire hazard. The 13-storey, {{convert|144|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} tall&lt;ref name=wan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to other sources, 12 stories, {{convert|38|m|ft|abbr=on}}&lt;/ref&gt; structure, known locally as [[Sutyagin house|"Sutyagin's skyscraper"]] ([[:ru:Небоскрёб Сутягина|Небоскрёб Сутягина]]), was found to be in violation of [[Arkhangelsk]] building codes, and in 2008 the courts ordered the building to be demolished by February 1, 2009.&lt;ref name=wan&gt;[http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=914 Sutyagin House, Arkhangelsk, Russia: Standing tall].

'''Ukraine'''

Different regions in [[Ukraine]] have their own distinctive style of vernacular architecture. For example, in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] and the surrounding [[foothills]], wood and clay are the primary traditional building materials. [[Ukrainian architecture]] is preserved at The Museum of Folk Architecture and Way of Life of Central [[Naddnipryanshchyna]] located in [[Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi]], Ukraine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5774">'''Vladimir Slepian''', a.k.a. '''Eric Pid''' ({{lang-ru|Владимир Слепян / Эрик Пид}}; 1930 – 7 July 1998) is a [[France|French]] artist and writer of [[Russia]]n-[[Jew]]ish origin.

==Biography==
Son of a repressed and executed Soviet functionary, Vladimir Slepian was born in [[Prague]] and resided in [[Leningrad]] before moving to [[Moscow]]. He began his university studies in mathematics, continuing as a student of fine art. In 1956 Slepian moved to Moscow. He attended the Picasso exhibition at the [[Pushkin Museum]] and presented his paintings to [[David Burliuk]], who was then staying at [[Hotel Moskva (Moscow)|Hotel Moskva]]. Burliuk inspired Slepian to look towards the way [[Jackson Pollock]] deposited paint on canvas with broad, lunging, spontaneous gestures. Slepian’s style evolved towards [[happening]] and [[performance art]]. He devoted several years to [[action painting]]. On one occasion, Slepian conducted a séance of simultaneous painting in collaboration with [[Yuri Zlotnikov]]. They suspended a bedsheet in the middle of a room and each of them painted one side of it whilst following the actions of his partner on the other side through the translucent fabric. Slepian created abstract paintings using a gas torch and paint dispensed out of a pump. He is said to have worked on a canvas a few kilometers long, by pouring paint on it from a truck. Slepian also made a pilgrimage to [[Nazım Hikmet]], who assured him and his friends that modern art will prevail over political oppression. In 1957 Paris' Right Bank Galerie Daniel Cordier mounted an anonymous exhibition of paintings by Vladimir Slepian, smuggled out of Moscow by its owner.

Vladimir Slepian emigrated to [[France]] in 1958, by way of [[Poland]]. In 1960 he conducted a performance of “transfinite painting” ("трансфинитная живопись") in Paris. Slepian sprinted along a roll of paper a hundred meters long, depositing paint in a manner that recalled calligraphy. Slepian competed with [[Georges Mathieu]], by creating a picture in ninety seconds. He is said to have turned a road into an action painting by throwing paint onto it whilst riding a motorcycle. In 1963, Slepian gave up painting, resolving to concentrate on writing. He founded a successful translation bureau, explaining his ambition as using his intelligence to put others to work for his benefit, whilst enjoying idleness. His business operated successfully until its manager quit in a protest against Slepian’s despotism.

In his only published French text, a short story ''Fils de chien'', Vladimir Slepian writes of a man who decides to become a dog. He transforms himself one limb and one organ at a time, mapping the effects of the canine body across a human form in a kind of diagramming. Since dogs are quadrupeds, he ties shoes to his hands and feet. When his paws prevent him from lacing the fourth shoe, he uses his mouth, which becomes a dog's snout. This metamorphosis almost succeeds, until the hero comes to the dog’s tail, for which he can find no analogue among human limbs. For him to involve his sexual organ in this transmogrification would tear him away from the society that he has begun to flee. Who would he be, if his identity could not be inferred from his anatomy? The story ends with a descent into childhood memories of the protagonist's mother. It appeared in n° 7 of the ''[[Revue Minuit]]'' alongside texts by [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Robert Pinget]], and [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]]. It served as inspiration for discussion by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]''.

Several years later, Vladimir Slepian renamed himself Eric Pid. He explained his new French name as an anagram of the blind king Oedipus, alluding to blindness at the etymological origins of his Russian family name. In his later years, Slepian succeeded at having his dramatic text staged as an interpolation in ''[[A quand Agamemnon ?]]'', an adaptation of [[Aeschylus]]’ ''[[Agamemnon]]'' by Philippe Brunet and Demodocos, a band of young artists specialized in classical theatre, performed in French, Latin and/or ancient Greek. He went around Paris, distributing framed photographs of this performance for wall display at restaurants. On 7 July 1998, Slepian collapsed on a sidewalk at [[Saint-Germain des Prés]]. The cause of his death is variously reported as [[hunger]] and a [[Myocardial infarction|cardiac crisis]]. He was buried as an [[indigent]], at the state’s expense.

Vladimir Slepian’s life served as inspiration for Viktor Atemian, the protagonist of 2007 feature film ''L’Homme qui marche'' by [[Aurélia Georges]].

[[File:great train robbery still.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Justus D. Barnes]] in Western apparel, as "Bronco Billy Anderson", from the [[silent film]] ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903), the first Western film]]

The '''Western''' is a [[genre]] of various arts which tell stories set primarily in the latter half of the 19th century in the [[American frontier|American Old West]], often centering on the life of a nomadic [[cowboy]] or [[gunfighter]]&lt;ref name="kimnewman"/&gt; armed with a [[revolver]] and a [[rifle]] who rides a horse. Cowboys and gunslingers typically wear [[Stetson]] hats, [[Kerchief|bandanna]]s, spurs, [[cowboy boot]]s and [[buckskins]]. Recurring characters include the aforementioned cowboys, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], bandits, lawmen, [[bounty hunter]]s, outlaws, soldiers (especially mounted cavalry, such as [[buffalo soldiers]]), and settlers (farmers, ranchers, and townsfolk). The ambience is usually punctuated with a [[Western music (North America)|Western music]] [[Film score|score]], including [[American folk music|American]] and [[Music of Mexico|Mexican folk music]] such as [[country music|country]], [[Indigenous music of North America|Native American music]], [[New Mexico music]], and [[ranchera]]s.

Westerns often stress the harshness of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape of deserts and mountains. Often, the vast landscape plays an important role, presenting a "...mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West".&lt;ref name="Cowie 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowie | first=Peter | title= John Ford and the American West | publisher=Harry Abrams Inc. | location= New York | year=2004 | isbn= 0-8109-4976-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific settings include ranches, small frontier towns, saloons, railways and isolated military forts of the [[Wild West]]. 

Common plots include:
* The construction of a railroad or a telegraph line on the wild frontier.
* Ranchers protecting their family ranch from [[rustler]]s or large landowners or who build a ranch empire.
* Revenge stories, which hinge on the chase and pursuit by someone who has been wronged.
* Stories about cavalry fighting Native Americans.
* Outlaw gang plots.
* Stories about a lawman or bounty hunter tracking down his quarry.
Many Westerns use a stock plot of depicting a crime, then showing the pursuit of the wrongdoer, ending in revenge and retribution, which is often dispensed through a [[shootout]] or [[Fast draw|quick-draw]] duel.&lt;ref name="Agnew"&gt;Agnew, Jeremy.

The Western was the most popular [[Hollywood]] genre from the early 20th century to the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&amp;f=false Indick, William. The Psychology of the Western. Pg. 2. McFarland, Aug 27, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
Western films first became well-attended in the 1930s. [[John Ford]]'s landmark Western adventure ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' became one of the biggest hits in 1939 and it made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream screen star. Westerns were very popular throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Many of the most acclaimed Westerns were released during this time, including ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953), ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), and ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). Classic Westerns such as these have been the inspiration for various films about Western-type characters in contemporary settings, such as ''[[Junior Bonner]]'' (1972), set in the 1970s, and ''[[The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada]]'' (2005), set in the 21st century.

==Themes==
[[File:Lone ranger silver 1965.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[Lone Ranger]]; a famous heroic [[wikt:lawman|lawman]] who was with a cavalry of six Texas Rangers, until they were all killed but him.  He preferred to remain anonymous, so he resigned and built a sixth grave that supposedly held his body.  He fights on as a lawman, wearing a mask, for, "Outlaws live in a world of fear.  Fear of the mysterious."]]
The Western genre sometimes portrays the conquest of the wilderness and the subordination of nature in the name of civilization or the confiscation of the territorial rights of the original, Native American, inhabitants of the frontier.&lt;ref name="kimnewman"&gt;{{cite book| last=Newman | first=Kim | title=Wild West Movies | publisher=Bloomsbury | year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Western depicts a society organized around codes of [[honor]] and personal, direct or private justice–"frontier justice"–dispensed by gunfights. These honor codes are often played out through depictions of feuds or individuals seeking personal [[revenge]] or [[wikt:retribution|retribution]] against someone who has wronged them (e.g., ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' has revenge and retribution as its main themes). This Western depiction of personal justice contrasts sharply with justice systems organized around rationalistic, abstract law that exist in cities, in which [[social order]] is maintained predominately through relatively impersonal institutions such as [[courtroom]]s. The popular perception of the Western is a story that centers on the life of a semi-nomadic wanderer, usually a [[cowboy]] or a [[gunfighter]].&lt;ref name="kimnewman"/&gt;  A showdown or [[Duel#Colonial North America and United States|duel]] at high noon featuring two or more gunfighters is a stereotypical scene in the popular conception of Westerns.

In some ways, such protagonists may be considered the literary descendants of the [[knight errant]] which stood at the center of earlier extensive genres such as the [[King Arthur|Arthurian Romances]].&lt;ref name="kimnewman"/&gt; Like the cowboy or gunfighter of the Western, the knight errant of the earlier European tales and poetry was wandering from place to place on his horse, fighting villains of various kinds and bound to no fixed social structures but only to his own innate code of honor. And like knights errant, the heroes of Westerns frequently rescue [[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]]. Similarly, the wandering protagonists of Westerns share many characteristics with the [[ronin]] in modern Japanese culture.

The Western typically takes these elements and uses them to tell simple morality tales, although some notable examples (e.g. the later Westerns of [[John Ford]] or [[Clint Eastwood]]'s ''[[Unforgiven]]'', about an old hired killer) are more morally ambiguous. Westerns often stress the harshness and isolation of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape. Western films generally have specific settings such as isolated ranches, Native American villages, or small frontier towns with a saloon. Often times, these settings appear deserted and without much structure. Apart from the wilderness, it is usually the saloon that emphasizes that this is the [[Wild West]]: it is the place to go for music (raucous piano playing), women (often [[prostitute]]s), gambling (draw poker or five card stud), drinking (beer or whiskey), brawling and shooting. In some Westerns, where civilization has arrived, the town has a church, a general store, a bank and a school; in others, where frontier rules still hold sway, it is, as [[Sergio Leone]] said, "where life has no value".

[[File:Gary Cooper 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gary Cooper]] in ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'']]
The [[American Film Institute]] defines Western films as those "set in the American West that [embody] the spirit, the struggle and the demise of the [[Frontier Thesis|new frontier]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=America's 10 Greatest Films in 10 Classic Genres| url= http://www.afi.com/10top10/ | publisher=[[American Film Institute]] | accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''Western'', used to describe a narrative film genre, appears to have originated with a July 1912 article in ''Motion Picture World'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;McMahan, Alison; ''Alice Guy Blache: Lost Visionary of the Cinema''; New York: Continuum, 2002; 133&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the characteristics of Western films were part of 19th-century popular [[Western fiction]] and were firmly in place before film became a popular art form.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Nash Smith, ''Virgin Land: The American West as Symbol and Myth'', Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;  Western films commonly feature protagonists such as cowboys, gunslingers, and bounty hunters, who are often depicted as semi-nomadic wanderers who wear [[Stetson]] hats, [[Kerchief|bandanna]]s, spurs, and [[buckskins]], use revolvers or rifles as everyday tools of survival–and as a means to settle disputes using "frontier justice". Protagonists ride between dusty towns and cattle ranches on their trusty steeds.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Western films were enormously popular in the [[silent film]] era (1894-1927). With the advent of sound in 1927-28, the major Hollywood studios rapidly abandoned Westerns,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/magazine/11schatz.html], ''New York Times Magazine'' (November 10, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the genre to smaller studios and producers. These smaller organizations churned out countless low-budget features and serials in the 1930s. By the late 1930s, the Western film was widely regarded as a "pulp" genre in Hollywood, but its popularity was dramatically revived in 1939 by major studio productions such as ''[[Dodge City (film)|Dodge City]]'' starring [[Errol Flynn]], ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' with [[Tyrone Power]], ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'' with [[Joel McCrea]], ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' featuring [[James Stewart]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]], and the release of John Ford's landmark Western adventure ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'', which became one of the biggest hits of the year. Released through United Artists, ''Stagecoach'' made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream screen star in the wake of a decade of headlining [[B westerns]]. Wayne had been introduced to the screen ten years earlier as the [[leading man]] in director [[Raoul Walsh]]'s [[widescreen]] ''[[The Big Trail]]'', which failed at the box office, due in part to exhibitors' inability to switch over to widescreen during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. After the Western's renewed commercial successes in the late 1930s, the popularity of the Western continued to rise until its peak in the 1950s, when the number of Western films produced outnumbered all other genres combined.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&amp;f=false Indick, William. The Psychology of the Western. Pg. 2 McFarland, Aug 27, 2008. ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Western films often depict conflicts with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. While early Eurocentric Westerns frequently portray the "Injuns" as dishonorable villains, the later and more culturally neutral Westerns gave Native Americans a more sympathetic treatment.  Other recurring themes of Westerns include Western treks (e.g. ''The Big Trail'') or perilous journeys (e.g. ''Stagecoach'') or groups of bandits terrorising small towns such as in ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''. Or revisionist westerns like ''[[I Walk the Line (film)|I Walk the Line]]'' (1970) depict sheriffs dueling.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

[[File:Western Set Universal Studio.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Western set at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Hollywood]]]]
Early Westerns were mostly filmed in the studio, just like other early Hollywood films, but when location shooting became more common from the 1930s, producers of Westerns used desolate corners of [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], or [[Wyoming]]. These settings gave filmmakers the ability to depict vast plains, looming mountains and epic canyons. Productions were also filmed on location at [[movie ranches]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Often, the vast landscape becomes more than a vivid backdrop; it becomes a character in the film. After the early 1950s, various wide screen formats such as [[Cinemascope]] (1953) and [[VistaVision]] used the expanded width of the screen to display spectacular Western landscapes. [[John Ford]]'s use of [[Monument Valley]] as an expressive landscape in his films from ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) to ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1965) "present us with a mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West, embodied most memorably in Monument Valley, with its buttes and mesas that tower above the men on horseback, whether they be settlers, soldiers, or Native Americans".&lt;ref name="Cowie 2004"/&gt;

[[File:Dan Duryea in Along Came Jones trailer.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dan Duryea]] in ''[[Along Came Jones (film)|Along Came Jones]]'' (1945)]]
Author and screenwriter [[Frank Gruber]] described seven plots for Westerns:&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, Frank  ''The Pulp Jungle'' Sherbourne Press, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cgw199010"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&amp;pub=2&amp;id=75 |title=No Soft Soap About New And Improved Computer Games |work=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1990 |accessdate=16 November 2013 |page=80 |type=editorial |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233126/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&amp;pub=2&amp;id=75 |archivedate=2 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Union Pacific story''. The plot concerns construction of a railroad, a telegraph line, or some other type of modern technology or transportation. Wagon train stories fall into this category.
# ''Ranch story''. The plot concerns threats to the ranch from rustlers or large landowners attempting to force out the proper owners.
# ''Empire story''. The plot involves building a ranch empire or an oil empire from scratch, a classic rags-to-riches plot.
# ''Revenge story''. The plot often involves an elaborate chase and pursuit by a wronged individual, but it may also include elements of the classic mystery story.
# ''Cavalry and Indian story''. The plot revolves around "taming" the wilderness for white settlers.
# ''Outlaw story''. The outlaw gangs dominate the action.
# ''Marshal story''. The lawman and his challenges drive the plot.

Gruber said that good writers used dialogue and plot development to develop these basic plots into believable stories.{{r|cgw199010}} Other subgenres include:
* The [[Spaghetti Western]].
* The [[epic (genre)|epic]] western
* [[singing cowboy]] westerns
* a few [[:Category:Western (genre) comedy films|comedy westerns]] such as:
** ''[[Along Came Jones (film)|Along Came Jones]]'' (1945), in which [[Gary Cooper]] spoofed his western persona
** ''[[The Sheepman]]'' (1958), with [[Glenn Ford]] poking fun at himself
** ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' (1965), with a drunk [[Lee Marvin]] atop a drunk horse. 

In the 1960s and 1970s, the Western was reinvented with the [[revisionist Western]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bandy|first=Mary Lea|title=Ride, Boldly Ride: The Evolution of the American Western|year=2012|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley/Los Angeles/London|isbn=978-0-520-25866-2|page=234|author2=Kevin Stoehr }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Classical Western====
[[File:John Wayne - 1961.JPG|right|thumb|[[John Wayne]] in ''[[The Comancheros (film)|The Comancheros]]'' (1961)]]
''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903), [[Edwin S. Porter]]'s film starring [[Broncho Billy Anderson]], is often cited as the first Western, though George N. Fenin and William K. Everson point out that the "Edison company had played with Western material for several years prior to ''The Great Train Robbery''. " Nonetheless, they concur that Porter's film "set the pattern—of crime, pursuit, and retribution—for the Western film as a genre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fenin|first=George N.|title=The Western: From Silents to Cinerama|year=1962|publisher=Bonanza Books|location=New York|page=47|author2=William K. Everson }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's popularity opened the door for Anderson to become the screen's first cowboy star; he made several hundred Western film shorts. So popular was the genre that he soon faced competition from [[Tom Mix]] and [[William S. Hart]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

The Golden Age of the Western is epitomized by the work of several directors, most prominent among them, [[John Ford]] (''[[My Darling Clementine]]'', ''[[The Horse Soldiers]]'', ''[[The Searchers]]''). Others include: [[Howard Hawks]] ([[Red River (1948 film)|''Red River'']], [[Rio Bravo (film)|''Rio Bravo'']]), [[Anthony Mann]] (''[[Man of the West]]'', ''[[The Man from Laramie]]''), [[Budd Boetticher]] (''[[Seven Men from Now]]''), [[Delmer Daves]] (''[[The Hanging Tree]]'', [[3:10 to Yuma (1957 film)|''3:10 to Yuma'']]), [[John Sturges]] (''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', ''[[Last Train from Gun Hill]]''), and [[Robert Aldrich]] ([[Vera Cruz (film)|''Vera Cruz'']], ''[[Ulzana's Raid]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oncamera.net.au/genres/drama/western-film/classical-western/|title=Classical Western {{!}}  OnCamera Studio|last=battam@icloud.com|first=Robbie Battam,|website=oncamera.net.au|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Acid Western====
Film critic [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] refers to a makeshift 1960s and 1970s genre called the [[Acid Western]],&lt;ref name=J&gt;{{cite web|website=Jonathanrosenbaum.net|url=https://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/2013/04/responding-to-some-questions-about-acid-westerns-and-dead-man/|author=Rosenbaum, Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Rosenbaum|title=Responding to some questions about “Acid Westerns” and DEAD MAN|date=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; associated with [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Jim McBride]], and [[Rudy Wurlitzer]], as well as films like [[Monte Hellman]]'s ''[[The Shooting]]'' (1966), [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]'s bizarre experimental film ''[[El Topo (1970 film)|El Topo (The Mole)]]'' (1970),&lt;ref name=J/&gt; and [[Robert Downey Sr.]]'s ''[[Greaser's Palace]]'' (1972).&lt;ref name=J/&gt; The 1970 film ''El Topo'' is an [[allegory|allegorical]] [[cult movie|cult]] Western and [[underground film]] about the eponymous character, a violent black-clad [[gunfighter]], and his quest for [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]. The film is filled with bizarre characters and occurrences, use of maimed and [[dwarfism|dwarf]] performers, and heavy doses of [[Christian symbolism]] and [[Eastern philosophy]]. Some Spaghetti Westerns also crossed over into the Acid Western genre, such as [[Enzo G. Castellari]]'s mystical ''[[Keoma (film)|Keoma]]'' (1976), a Western reworking of [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s metaphysical ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' (1957).

More recent Acid Westerns include [[Alex Cox]]'s film ''[[Walker (film)|Walker]]'' (1987) and [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s film ''[[Dead Man]]'' (1995). Rosenbaum describes the Acid Western as "formulating a chilling, savage frontier poetry to justify its hallucinated agenda"; ultimately, he says, the Acid Western expresses a counterculture sensibility to critique and replace capitalism with alternative forms of exchange.&lt;ref name="Chicago Reader"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/archives/0696/06286.html |title=''Acid Western: Dead Man'' |publisher="Chicago Reader" |date=June 26, 1996 |first=Jonathan |last=Rosenbaum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929104355/http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/archives/0696/06286.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!---We need a section here on Westerns in the 80s, 90s and 2000s---&gt;

====Charro, Cabrito or Chili Westerns====
[[Charro#In cinema|Charro Westerns]], often featuring musical stars as well as action, have been a standard feature of [[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican cinema]] since the 1930s. In the 1930s and 1940s, these were typically films about horsemen in rural Mexican society, displaying a set of cultural concerns very different from the Hollywood meta-narrative, but the overlap between 'charro' movies and westerns became more apparent in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Rashotte, Ryan ''Narco Cinema: Sex, Drugs, and Banda Music in Mexico's B-Filmography'' Palgrave Macmillan, 23 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 6 Figueredo, Danilo H. ''Revolvers and Pistolas, Vaqueros and Caballeros: Debunking the Old West'' ABC-CLIO, 9 Dec 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

====Comedy Western====
This subgenre is imitative in style in order to mock, comment on, or trivialize the Western genre's established traits, subjects, auteurs' styles, or some other target by means of humorous, satiric, or ironic imitation or parody. A prime example of Comedy Western includes ''[[The Paleface]]'' (1948), which makes a satirical effort to "send-up Owen Wister's novel The Virginian and all the cliches of the Western from the fearless hero to the final shootout on main street. The result was The Paleface (1948) which features a cowardly hero known as "Painless" Peter Potter (Bob Hope), an inept dentist who often entertains the notion that he's a crack sharpshooter and accomplished Indian fighter". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stafford |first1=Jeff |title=The Paleface (1948) |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/88935%7C0/The-Paleface.html |website=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contemporary Western====
Also known as Neo-Westerns, these films have contemporary U.S. settings, and they utilize Old West themes and motifs (a rebellious anti-hero, open plains and desert landscapes, and gunfights). For the most part, they still take place in the [[Western United States|American West]] and reveal the progression of the [[Old West]] mentality into the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This subgenre often features Old West-type characters struggling with displacement in a "civilized" world that rejects their outdated brand of justice.

Examples include [[John Sturges]]'s ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]'' (1955); ''[[Lonely Are the Brave]]'', screenplay by [[Dalton Trumbo]] (1962), ''[[Hud (1963 film)|Hud]]'', starring [[Paul Newman]] (1963); [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971); ''[[The Getaway (1972 film)|The Getaway]]'' (1972); ''[[Junior Bonner]]'' (1972); ''[[Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia]]'' (1974); ''[[Hearts of the West (1975 film)|Hearts of the West]]'' starring [[Jeff Bridges]] (1975); [[Alan J. Pakula]]'s ''[[Comes a Horseman]]'' (1978); ''[[J. W. Coop]]'', directed/co-written by and starring [[Cliff Robertson]]; [[Robert Rodríguez]]'s ''[[El Mariachi]]'' (1992) and ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]'' (2003); [[John Sayles]]'s ''[[Lone Star (1996 film)|Lone Star]]'' (1996); [[Tommy Lee Jones]]'s ''[[The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada]]'' (2005); [[Ang Lee]]'s ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' (2005); [[Wim Wenders]]'s ''[[Don't Come Knocking]]'' (2005); [[Joel and Ethan Coen]]'s ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'' (2007); the television show ''[[Justified (TV series)|Justified]]'' (2010–2015); ''[[Hell or High Water (film)|Hell or High Water]]'' (2016) and ''[[Wind River (film)|Wind River]]'' (2017), both written by [[Taylor Sheridan]]; and the superhero film ''[[Logan (2017 film)|Logan]]'' (2017). ''[[Call of Juarez: The Cartel]]'' is an example of a Neo-Western video game. Likewise, the television series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', which takes place in modern times, features many examples of Western archetypes. According to creator [[Vince Gilligan]], "After the first ''Breaking Bad'' episode, it started to dawn on me that we could be making a contemporary western. So you see scenes that are like gunfighters squaring off, like [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Lee Van Cleef]]—we have [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] and others like that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.local-iq.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3019&amp;Itemid=56 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403091323/http://www.local-iq.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3019&amp;Itemid=56 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 April 2013 |title=Contemporary Western: An interview with Vince Gilligan |date=27 March 2013 |publisher=[[Local iQ]] |work=News |accessdate=31 May 2013 |place=United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precursor to these{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} was the radio series ''[[Tales of the Texas Rangers]]'' (1950–1952), with [[Joel McCrea]], a contemporary detective drama set in Texas, featuring many of the characteristics of traditional Westerns.

====Electric Western====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Zachariah.jpg|right|thumbnail|''[[Zachariah (film)|Zachariah]]'' (1971)]] --&gt;
The 1971 film ''[[Zachariah (film)|Zachariah]]'' starring [[John Rubinstein]], [[Don Johnson]] and [[Pat Quinn (actress)|Pat Quinn]] was billed as the "first electric Western."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The film featured multiple performing [[musical ensemble|rock bands]] in an otherwise [[American frontier|American West]] setting.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D05E3DE163BE53BBC4D51DFB766838A669EDE|title=Zachariah (1970) Screen: 'Zachariah,' an Odd Western|authorlink=Roger Greenspun|author=Greenspun, Roger|date=January 25, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epic Western====
The epic western is a subgenre of the western that emphasizes the story of the American Old West on a grand scale. Many epic westerns are commonly set during a turbulent time, especially a war, as in Sergio Leone's ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), set during the American Civil War, or Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), set during the Mexican Revolution. One of the grandest films in this genre is Leone's ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968), which shows many operatic conflicts centered on control of a town while utilizing wide scale shots on Monument Valley locations against a broad running time. Other notable examples include ''[[The Iron Horse (film)|The Iron Horse]]'' (1924), ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946), ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958), ''[[Cimarron (1960 film)|Cimarron]]'' (1960), [[How the West Was Won (film)|''How the West Was Won'']] (1962), ''[[Duck, You Sucker!]]'' (1971), ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990), ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'' (2007), ''[[Django Unchained]]'' (2012) and  ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]'' (2015).

====Euro-Western====
Euro Westerns are Western genre films made in [[Western Europe]]. The term can sometimes, but not necessarily, include the [[Spaghetti Western]] subgenre (see below). One example of a Euro Western is the Anglo-Spanish film ''[[Savage Guns (1961 film)|The Savage Guns]]'' ([[1961 in film|1961]]).  Several Euro-Western films, nicknamed Sauerkraut Westerns&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page= 118 |authors=Brookeman, Christopher &amp; British Film Institute |title=The BFI Companion to the Western|publisher= A. Deutsch|date= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; because they were made in [[Germany]] and shot in Yugoslavia, were derived from stories by novelist [[Karl May]] and were [[Karl May film adaptations|film adaptations of May's work]]. In the 2010s some new euro-westerns emerged like [[Kristian Levring]]'s [[The Salvation (film)|''The Salvation'']], [[Martin Koolhoven]]'s [[Brimstone (2016 film)|''Brimstone'']] and [[Andreas Prochaska]]'s ''[[The Dark Valley]]''.

====Fantasy Western====
{{main|Weird West}}
Fantasy Westerns mixed in [[fantasy]] settings and themes, and may include Fantasy mythology as background. Some famous examples are [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Stand]]'' and ''[[The Dark Tower series]]'' of novels, the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] comics series ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'', and [[Keiichi Sigsawa]]'s light novel series, ''[[Kino's Journey]]'', illustrated by [[Kouhaku Kuroboshi]].

====Florida Western====
[[Florida Western]]s, also known as Cracker Westerns, are set in [[Florida]] during the [[Second Seminole War]]. An example is ''[[Distant Drums]]'' (1951) starring [[Gary Cooper]].

====Horror Western====
{{main|Weird West}}
A developing subgenre,{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} with roots in films such as ''[[Curse of the Undead]]'' (1959) and ''[[Billy the Kid vs. Dracula]]'' (1966), which depicts the legendary outlaw [[Billy the Kid]] fighting against the notorious vampire. Another example is ''The Ghoul Goes West'', an unproduced [[Ed Wood]] film to star [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Dracula]] in the Old West.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Recent examples include the films ''[[Near Dark]]'' (1987) directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]] which tells the story about a human falling in love with a [[vampire]], ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'' (1996) by [[Robert Rodriguez]] deals with outlaws battling vampires across the border, ''[[Vampires]]'' (1998) by [[John Carpenter]] tells about a group of vampires and vampire hunters looking for an ancient relic in the west, ''[[Ravenous (1999 film)|Ravenous]]'' (1999), which deals with cannibalism at a remote US army outpost; ''[[The Burrowers]]'' (2008), about a band of trackers who are stalked by the titular creatures; and ''[[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter]]'' (2012). ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'' (2010), an expansion to ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game in this genre, telling the tale of a [[zombie]] outbreak in the [[Old West]]. ''[[Bone Tomahawk]]'' (2016) one of the most recent entries in the genre received wide critical acclaim for its chilling tale of cannibalism but, like many other movies in the genre, it wasn't a commercial success.

====Curry Westerns and Indo Westerns====
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
The first Western films made in India - ''Mosagaalaku Mosagaadu'' (1970), made in Telugu, ''Mappusakshi'' (Malayalam),{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''[[Ganga (1972 film)|Ganga]]'' (1972), and ''Jakkamma'' (Tamil){{citation needed|date=April 2015}} - were based on Classic Westerns. ''[[Thazhvaram]]'' (1990), the Malayalam film directed by [[Bharathan]] and written by noted writer [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], is perhaps the most resemblant of the Spaghetti Westerns in terms of production and cinematic techniques. Earlier Spaghetti Westerns laid the groundwork for such films as ''[[Adima Changala]]'' (1971) starring [[Prem Nazir]], a hugely popular "zapata Spaghetti Western film in Malayalam, and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975) ''[[Khote Sikkay]]'' (1973)  and ''[[Thai Meethu Sathiyam]]'' (1978) are notable Curry Westerns. ''[[Kodama Simham]]'' (1990), a Telugu action film starring [[Chiranjeevi]] and [[Mohan Babu]] was one more addition to the Indo Western genre and fared well at the box office. It was also the first South Indian movie to be dubbed in English as ''Hunters of the Indian Treasure''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |title=Hunters of the Indian Treasure |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205013433/https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |archivedate=2017-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Takkari Donga]]'' (2002), starring Telugu Maheshbabu, was applauded by critics but an average runner at box office. ''[[Quick Gun Murugun]]'' (2009), an Indian comedy film which spoofs Indian Western movies, is based on a character created for television promos at the time of the launch of the music network Channel [V] in 1994, which had cult following.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''[[Irumbukkottai Murattu Singam]]'' (2010), a Western adventure comedy film, based on cowboy movies and paying homages to the [[John Wayne]], [[Clint Eastwood]], and [[Jaishankar]], was made in Tamil.

====Martial arts Western (Wuxia Western)====
While many of these mash-ups (e.g., ''[[Billy Jack]]'' (1971) and its sequel ''[[The Trial of Billy Jack]]'' (1974)) are cheap exploitation films, others are more serious dramas such as the ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' TV series, which ran from 1972 to 1975. Comedy examples include the [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Owen Wilson]] collaboration ''[[Shanghai Noon]]'' (2000). Further sub-divisions of this subgenre include ''[[Ninja]] Westerns'' and ''[[Samurai]] Westerns'' (incorporating [[samurai cinema]] themes), such as ''[[Red Sun]]'' (1971) with [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Toshiro Mifune]].

====Meat pie Western====
The [[Meat pie Western]] (also ''Kangaroo Western'')(a slang term which plays on the Italo-western moniker "[[Spaghetti Western]]") is an American Western-style movie or TV series set in Australia, especially the [[Australian Outback]] or the [[The bush#Australia|Australian Bush]].&lt;ref name=AusF&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross Cooper|first=Andrew Pike|title=Australian Film 1900-1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0195507843|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films such as ''[[Rangle River]]'' (1936), ''[[Kangaroo (1952 film)|Kangaroo]]'' (1952), the television series [[Whiplash (TV series)|Whiplash]] (1961), ''[[Mad Dog Morgan]]'' (1976), ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man from Snowy River]]'' (1982), ''[[Five Mile Creek]]'' (1983–85), ''[[Quigley Down Under]]'' (1991), and ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' (2005) are all representative of the genre. The term is used to differentiate more Americanized Australian films from those with a more historical basis, such as those about [[bushrangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51588737 |title=HOLLYWOOD|work=The Australian Women's Weekly|date= November 4, 1981|page= 157|accessdate= December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northwestern====
The [[Northern (genre)|Northern genre]] is a subgenre of Westerns taking place in [[Alaska]] or [[Western Canada]]. Examples include several versions of the [[Rex Beach]] novel, ''[[The Spoilers (Beach novel)|The Spoilers]]'' (including 1930's ''[[The Spoilers (1930 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Gary Cooper, and 1942's ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Marlene Dietrich, [[Randolph Scott]] and Wayne); ''[[The Far Country]]'' (1954) with James Stewart; ''[[North to Alaska]]'' (1960) with Wayne;  ''[[Death Hunt]]'' (1981) with [[Charles Bronson]]; and ''[[The Grey Fox]]'' (1983) with [[Richard Farnsworth]].

====Ostern====
{{main|Ostern}}
[[Ostern]]s, also known as "Red Western"s, are produced in [[Eastern Europe]]. They were popular in Communist Eastern European countries and were a particular favorite of [[Joseph Stalin]],&lt;nowiki&gt;￼￼ and usually portrayed the &lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] sympathetically, as oppressed people fighting for their rights, in contrast to American Westerns of the time, which frequently portrayed the Indians as villains. Osterns frequently featured [[Romani people|Gypsies]] or [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people in the role of the Indians, due to the shortage of authentic Indians in Eastern Europe.

[[Gojko Mitić]] portrayed righteous, kind-hearted, and charming Indian [[Tribal chief|chiefs]] (e.g., in ''[[The Sons of the Great Mother Bear|Die Söhne der großen Bärin]]'' (1966) directed by [[Josef Mach]]). He became honorary chief of the [[Sioux]] tribe, when he visited the United States in the 1990s and the television crew accompanying him showed the tribe one of his films. American actor and singer [[Dean Reed]], an expatriate who lived in [[East Germany]], also starred in several Ostern films.

====Pornographic Western====
The most rare of the Western subgenres, pornographic Westerns use the Old West as a background for stories primarily focused on erotica. The three major examples of the porn Western film are [[Russ Meyer]]'s [[nudie-cutie]] ''[[Wild Gals of the Naked West]]'' (1962), and the hardcore ''[[A Dirty Western]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sweet Savage (1979 film)|Sweet Savage]]'' (1979). ''Sweet Savage'' starred [[Aldo Ray]], a veteran actor who had appeared in traditional Westerns, in a non-sex role. Among videogames, ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'' (1982) is an infamous example, considered to be one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst video games of all time]].

====Revisionist Western====
After the early 1960s, many American filmmakers began to question and change many traditional elements of Westerns, and to make [[Revisionist Western]]s that encouraged audiences to question the simple hero-versus-villain dualism and the morality of using violence to test one's character or to prove oneself right. This is shown in Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). One major revision was the increasingly positive representation of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who had been treated as "savages" in earlier films. Examples of such revisionist Westerns include ''[[Ride the High Country]] (1962),''[[Richard Harris]]' ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' (1970), ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Soldier Blue]] (1970),'' ''[[Man in the Wilderness]]'' (1971), ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990) and ''[[Dead Man]]'' (1995). A few earlier Revisionist Westerns gave women more powerful roles, such as ''[[Westward the Women]]'' (1951) starring [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]].  Another earlier work encompassed all these features, ''[[The Last Wagon (1956 film)|The Last Wagon]]'' (1956). In it, [[Richard Widmark]] played a white man raised by [[Comanche]]s and persecuted by [[white people|whites]], with [[Felicia Farr]] and [[Susan Kohner]] playing young women forced into leadership roles.

====Science fiction Western====
The [[science fiction Western]] places [[science fiction]] elements within a traditional Western setting. Examples include ''[[Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter]]'' (1965),''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'' (1969) featuring cowboys and dinosaurs. [[John Jakes]]'s "Six Gun Planet" takes place on a future planet colonized by people consciously seeking to recreate the Old West (with cowboys riding robot horses...) [https://books.google.co.il/books/about/On_Wheels_Six_Gun_Planet.html?id=Q6OGZprSGtcC&amp;redir_esc=y]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The movie ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'' (1973) and its sequel ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Wild Wild West]]'' (1999), ''[[Cowboys &amp; Aliens]]'' (2011), and the TV series [[Westworld (TV series)|''Westworld'']] (2016, based on the movie). ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game that follows this format, with futuristic technology and genetic mutations placed among the western themes and desert sprawl of the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave Wasteland]].

====Space Western====
The [[Space Western|Space Western or Space Frontier]] is a subgenre of [[science fiction]] which uses the themes and [[trope (literature)|trope]]s of Westerns within science fiction stories. Subtle influences may include exploration of new, lawless frontiers, while more overt influences may feature literal cowboys in outer space who use [[ray gun]]s and ride robotic horses. Examples include the American television series ''[[Brave Starr]]'' (which aired original episodes from September 1987 to February 1988) and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' (created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002), and the films ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' (1980), which is a remake of ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''; ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' (1981), which is a remake of ''[[High Noon]]''; and ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'' (2005, based on the ''[[Firefly (television show)|Firefly]]'' TV series). The classic western genre has also been a major influence on science fiction films such as the original ''[[Star Wars: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' movie of 1977. Famously [[Gene Roddenberry]] pitched the concept of the TV show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' as a ''Wagon Train to the stars.''

====Spaghetti Western====
{{main|Spaghetti Western|Zapata Western}}
During the 1960s and 1970s, a revival of the Western emerged in [[Italy]] with the "[[Spaghetti Westerns]]" also known as "Italo-Westerns". The most famous of them is ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966).  Many of these films are low-budget affairs, shot in locations (for example, the Spanish desert [[Province of Almería|region of Almería]]) chosen for their inexpensive crew and production costs as well as their similarity to landscapes of the [[Southwestern United States]]. Spaghetti Westerns were characterized by the presence of more action and violence than the Hollywood Westerns. Also, the protagonists usually acted out of more selfish motives (money or revenge being the most common) than in the classical westerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frayling, Christopher |title=Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone|publisher=IB Tauris|date= 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Spaghetti Westerns demythologized the American Western tradition, and some films from the genre are considered [[revisionist Western]]s.

The Western films directed by [[Sergio Leone]] were felt by some to have a different tone than the Hollywood Westerns.&lt;ref name=TG/&gt; Veteran American actors [[Charles Bronson]], [[Lee Van Cleef]] and [[Clint Eastwood]]&lt;ref name=TG/&gt; became famous by starring in Spaghetti Westerns, although the films also provided a showcase for other noted actors such as [[James Coburn]], [[Henry Fonda]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Klaus Kinski]], and [[Jason Robards]]. Eastwood, previously the lead in the television series ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', unexpectedly found himself catapulted into the forefront of the film industry by Leone's ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]''.&lt;ref name=TG&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=Forget the Spaghetti Western – try a Curry Western or a Sauerkraut one|author=Billson, Anne|date=September 15, 2014|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/11096814/Forget-the-Spaghetti-Western-try-a-Curry-Western-or-a-Sauerkraut-one.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Weird Western====
{{main|Weird West}}
The [[Weird Western]] subgenre blends elements of a classic Western with other elements. ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' television series, television movies, and 1999 film adaptation blend the Western with [[steampunk]]. The ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' franchise also blends the Western with superhero elements. The film ''[[Western Religion (film)|Western Religion]]'' (2015), by writer and director [[James O'Brien (filmmaker)|James O'Brien]], introduces the devil into a traditional wild west setting. ''[[Old Man Logan]]'' (2008-2009) graphic novel combines the elements of superhero and post-apocalyptic fiction with western.

===Genre studies===
[[File:Tommixgunslinger.jpg|[[Tom Mix]] in ''Mr. Logan, U.S.A.'', c. 1919|thumb]]

In the 1960s academic and critical attention to cinema as a legitimate art form emerged. With the increased attention, [[film theory]] was developed to attempt to understand the significance of film. From this environment emerged (in conjunction with the literary movement) an enclave of critical studies called [[genre studies]]. This was primarily a semantic and structuralist approach to understanding how similar films convey meaning.

One of the results of genre studies is that some{{who|date=April 2013}} have argued that "Westerns" need not take place in the American West or even in the 19th century, as the codes can be found in other types of films. For example, a very typical Western plot is that an eastern lawman heads west, where he matches wits and trades bullets with a gang of outlaws and thugs, and is aided by a local lawman who is well-meaning but largely ineffective until a critical moment when he redeems himself by saving the hero's life. This description can be used to describe any number of Westerns, but also other films such as ''[[Die Hard]]'' (itself a loose reworking of High Noon) and [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', which are frequently cited examples of films that do not take place in the American West but have many themes and characteristics common to Westerns. Likewise, films set in the [[American Old West]] may not necessarily be considered "Westerns."

===Influences===
Being period drama pieces, both the Western and [[Samurai cinema|samurai genre]] influenced each other in style and themes throughout the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cowboys and Shoguns: The American Western, Japanese Jidaigeki, and Cross-Cultural Exchange |url=http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&amp;context=srhonorsprog |website=Digitalcommons.uri.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929002901/http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&amp;context=srhonorsprog |archivedate=2015-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' was a remake of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[The Seven Samurai]]'', and ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' was a remake of Kurosawa's ''[[Yojimbo (movie)|Yojimbo]]'', which itself was inspired by ''[[Red Harvest]]'', an American detective novel by [[Dashiell Hammett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=New DVDs: ‘Films of Kenneth Anger’ and ‘Samurai Classics’|first=Dave|last=Kehr|date=January 23, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/movies/homevideo/23dvd.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa was influenced by American Westerns and was a fan of the genre, most especially [[John Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Crogan |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |title=Translating Kurosawa |work=Senses of Cinema |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003194402/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |archivedate=2009-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |title=Star Wars Origins |publisher=''Far Cry from the Original Site'' |first=Justine |last=Shaw |accessdate=December 20, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103145347/http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |archivedate=November 3, 2015 |df= }} December 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the [[Cold War]], the Western was a strong influence on Eastern Bloc cinema, which had its own take on the genre, the so-called "[[Red Western]]" or "Ostern". Generally these took two forms: either straight Westerns shot in the Eastern Bloc, or action films involving the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and [[Russian civil war|civil war]] and the [[Basmachi]] rebellion.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

An offshoot of the Western genre is the "post-apocalyptic" Western, in which a future society, struggling to rebuild after a major catastrophe, is portrayed in a manner very similar to the 19th-century frontier. Examples include ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' and the ''[[Mad Max]]'' [[Mad Max (franchise)|series]], and the computer game series ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]''. Many elements of space travel series and films borrow extensively from the conventions of the Western genre. This is particularly the case in the [[space Western]] subgenre of science fiction. [[Peter Hyams]]' ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' transferred the plot of ''[[High Noon]]'' to Io, moon of Jupiter. [[Gene Roddenberry]], the creator of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series, pitched his show as "''Wagon Train'' to the stars" early on, but admitted later that this was more about getting it produced in a time that loved Western-themed TV series than about its actual content.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} ''[[The Book of Eli]]'' depicts the post apocalypse as a Western with large knives.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

More recently, the [[space opera]] series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' used an explicitly Western theme for its portrayal of frontier worlds. [[Anime]] shows like ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', ''[[Trigun]]'' and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' have been similar mixes of science fiction and Western elements. The [[science fiction Western]] can be seen as a subgenre of either Westerns or science fiction. Elements of Western films can be found also in some films belonging essentially to other genres. For example, ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]'' is a war film, but action and characters are Western-like. The British film ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'' set during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] has sometimes been compared to a Western, even though it is set in [[South Africa]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

The character played by [[Humphrey Bogart]] in [[film noir]] films such as ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]''—an individual bound only by his own private code of honor—has a lot in common with the classic Western hero. In turn, the Western, has also explored noir elements, as with the films ''[[Pursued]]'' and ''[[Sugar Creek (film)|Sugar Creek]]''.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In many of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s books, the settlement of other planets is depicted in ways explicitly modeled on American settlement of the West. For example, in his ''[[Tunnel in the Sky]]'' settlers set out to the planet "New Canaan", via an [[interstellar teleporter]] portal across the galaxy, in [[Conestoga wagon]]s, their captain sporting mustaches and a little goatee and riding a [[Palomino]] horse—with Heinlein explaining that the colonists would need to survive on their own for some years, so horses are more practical than machines.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

[[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' is a series of seven books that meshes themes of Westerns, [[high fantasy]], [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]]. The protagonist [[Roland of Gilead|Roland Deschain]] is a gunslinger whose image and personality are largely inspired by the "[[Man with No Name]]" from [[Sergio Leone]]'s films. In addition, the [[superhero]] [[fantasy]] genre has been described as having been derived from the cowboy hero, only powered up to omnipotence in a primarily urban setting. The Western genre has been parodied on a number of occasions, famous examples being ''[[Support Your Local Sheriff!]]'', ''[[Cat Ballou]]'', [[Mel Brooks]]'s ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', and ''[[Rustler's Rhapsody]]''.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

[[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' films use many elements of a Western, and Lucas has said he intended for ''Star Wars'' to revitalize cinematic mythology, a part the Western once held. The [[Jedi]], who take their name from [[Jidaigeki]], are modeled after samurai, showing the influence of Kurosawa. The character [[Han Solo]] dressed like an archetypal gunslinger, and the [[Mos Eisley]] cantina is much like an Old West saloon.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Meanwhile, films such as ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', which plucked actor [[Sam Elliott]] out of the Old West and into a Los Angeles bowling alley, and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', about a Southern-boy-turned-gigolo in New York (who disappoints a client when he doesn't measure up to Gary Cooper), transplanted Western themes into modern settings for both purposes of parody and homage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert |last=Silva |url=http://blogs.amctv.com/future-of-classic/2009/05/cowboys-in-non-westerns.php |publisher=Not From 'Round Here...

==Literature==
{{Main|Western fiction}}
[[Western fiction]] is a genre of literature set in the [[American Old West]], most commonly between the years of 1860 and 1900. The first critically recognized Western was ''[[The Virginian (novel)|The Virginian]]'' (1902) by [[Owen Wister]].{{cite web |url=https://wildwestliving.com/blogs/news/wild-west-literature |title=Classic Wild West Literature }} Other well-known writers of Western fiction include [[Zane Grey]], from the early 1900s, [[Ernest Haycox]], [[Luke Short]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], from the mid 20th century. Many writers better known in other genres, such as [[Leigh Brackett]], [[Elmore Leonard]], and [[Larry McMurtry]], have also written Western novels. The genre's popularity peaked in the 1960s, due in part to the shuttering of many pulp magazines, the popularity of [[Television Westerns|televised Westerns]], and the rise of the spy novel. Readership began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s and reached a new low in the 2000s. Most bookstores, outside of a few Western states, now only carry a small number of Western novels and short story collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McVeigh, Stephen |title=The American Western|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|date= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary forms that share similar themes include stories of the [[American frontier]], the [[gaucho literature]] of [[Argentina]], and tales of the settlement of the [[Australian Outback]].

==Television==

[[File:James Garner Jack Kelly Maverick 1959.JPG|right|thumb|[[James Garner]] and [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]] in ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957)]]
[[Television Westerns]] are a subgenre of the Western. When television became popular in the late 1940s and 1950s, TV Westerns quickly became an audience favorite.&lt;ref&gt;Gary A. Yoggy, ''Riding the Video Range: The Rise and Fall of the Western on Television'' (McFarland &amp; Company, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with re-broadcasts of existing films, a number of movie cowboys had their own TV shows. As demand for the Western increased, new stories and stars were introduced. A number of long-running [[TV Western]]s became classics in their own right, such as: ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'' (1949-1957), ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'' (1955-1961), ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' (1955-1975),  ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957-1962), ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel]]'' (1957-1963), ''[[Wagon Train]]'' (1957-1965), ''[[Sugarfoot]]'' (1957-1961), ''[[The Rifleman]]'' (1958-1963), ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' (1959-1966), ''[[Bonanza]]'' (1959-1973),  ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' (1962-1971), and ''[[The Big Valley]]'' (1965-1969).   ''The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp'' was the first Western [[television series]] written for adults,&lt;ref name="The Eastern Earps"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burris|first1=Joe|title=The Eastern Earps|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-05-10/features/0505100100_1_wyatt-earp-genealogy-indentured|accessdate=October 20, 2014 |date=May 10, 2005|publisher=Baltimore Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; premiering four days before ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' on September 6, 1955.&lt;ref name="IMDb title|tt0047750"&gt;{{IMDb title|tt0047750}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMDb title|tt0047736"&gt;{{IMDb title|tt0047736}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The peak year for television Westerns was 1959, with 26 such shows airing during primetime. At least six of them were connected in some extent to [[Wyatt Earp]]: ''The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp'', ''[[Bat Masterson (TV series)|Bat Masterson]]'', ''[[Tombstone Territory]]'', ''[[Broken Arrow (TV series)|Broken Arrow]]'', ''[[Johnny Ringo (TV series)|Johnny Ringo]]'', and ''Gunsmoke''.&lt;ref name="guinn"&gt;[Guinn, Jeff. ''The Last Gunfight: The Real Story of the Shootout at the O.K. Corral and How it Changed the American West'' (First hardcover ed.). New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. {{ISBN|978-1-4391-5424-3}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing costs of [[American television]] production weeded out most action half hour series in the early 1960s, and their replacement by hour-long television shows, increasingly in color.&lt;ref&gt;Kisseloff, J. (editor) ''The Box: An Oral History of Television''&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Westerns died out in the late 1960s as a result of network changes in [[demographic targeting]] along with pressure from parental television groups. Future entries in the genre would incorporate elements from other genera, such as crime drama and mystery whodunit elements. Western shows from the 1970s included ''[[Hec Ramsey]]'', ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', and ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]''. In the 1990s and 2000s, hour-long Westerns and slickly packaged made-for-TV movie Westerns were introduced, such as: ''[[Lonesome Dove (film)|Lonesome Dove]]'' (1989) and ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''. As well, new elements were once again added to the Western formula, such as the Western-[[science fiction]] show ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002. ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' was a critically acclaimed Western series which aired on [[HBO]] from 2004 through 2006.

[[File:Wild West 1908.jpg|thumb|300px|"As Wild felled one of the redskins by a blow from the butt of his revolver, and sprang for the one with the tomahawk, the chief's daughter suddenly appeared. Raising her hands, she exclaimed, 'Go back, Young Wild West. I will save her!'" (1908)]]

==Visual art==
{{Main|Artists of the American West}}
A number of visual artists focused their work on representations of the [[American Old West]]. American West-oriented art is sometimes referred to as "Western Art" by Americans. This relatively new category of art includes paintings, sculptures, and sometimes Native American crafts. Initially, subjects included exploration of the Western states and cowboy themes. [[Frederic Remington]] and [[Charles M. Russell]] are two artists who captured the "Wild West" on canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Buscombe, Edward |title=Painting the Legend: Frederic Remington and the Western|work=Cinema Journal|date=1984|pages= 12–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some art museums, such as the [[Buffalo Bill Center of the West]] in Wyoming and the [[Autry National Center]] in Los Angeles, feature American Western Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Goetzmann, William H. |title=The West of the Imagination|location=New York|publisher= Norton|date= 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==
The popularity of Westerns extends beyond films, literature, television, and visual art to include numerous other media forms.

===Anime and manga===
With [[anime]] and [[manga]], the genre tends towards the [[Science fiction Western]] [e.g., ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' (1998 anime), ''[[Trigun]]'' (1995-2007 manga), and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' (1996-1999 manga)]. Although contemporary Westerns also appear, such as ''[[Kōya no Shōnen Isamu]]'', a 1971 [[shōnen]] manga about a boy with a Japanese father and a Native American mother, or ''[[El Cazador de la Bruja]]'', a 2007 anime television series set in modern-day Mexico. Part 7 of the manga series ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' is based in the American Western setting. The story follows racers in a transcontinental horse race, the "Steel Ball Run" race.

===Comics===
[[Western comics]] have included serious entries (such as the classic comics of the late 1940s and early 1950s (such as ''[[Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'', ''[[Rawhide Kid]]'', and ''[[Red Ryder]]''), cartoons, and parodies (such as ''[[Cocco Bill]]'' and ''[[Lucky Luke]]''). In the 1990s and 2000s, Western comics leaned toward the [[Weird West]] subgenre, usually involving supernatural monsters, or Christian iconography as in ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]''. However, more traditional Western comics are found throughout this period (e.g., ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' and ''[[Loveless (comics)|Loveless]]'').

===Games===
Western [[arcade game]]s, [[computer game]]s, [[role-playing game]]s, and [[video games]] are often either straightforward Westerns or Western Horror hybrids.  Some Western themed-computer games include ''[[The Oregon Trail (1971 video game)|The Oregon Trail]]'' (1971), ''[[Mad Dog McCree]]'' (1990), ''[[Sunset Riders]]'' (1991), ''[[Outlaws (1997 video game)|Outlaws]]'' (1997), ''[[Red Dead Revolver]]'' (2004), ''[[Gun (video game)|Gun]]'' (2005), ''[[Call of Juarez]]'' (2007), ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010), and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018). Other video games adapt the [[Science fiction Western]] or [[Weird West]] subgenres such as ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' (1997), ''[[Gunman Chronicles]]'' (2000), ''[[Darkwatch]]'' (2005), the [[Borderlands (series)|''Borderlands'' series]] (first released in 2009)'', [[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010), and ''[[Hard West]]'' (2015).

===Radio dramas===
Western [[radio drama]]s were very popular from the 1930s to the 1960s.  Some popular shows include ''[[Lone Ranger#Original radio series|The Lone Ranger]]'' (first broadcast in 1933), ''[[The Cisco Kid#Radio|The Cisco Kid]]'' (first broadcast in 1942), ''[[Dr. Sixgun]]'' (first broadcast in 1954), ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel#Radio show|Have Gun–Will Travel]]'' (first broadcast in 1958), and ''[[Gunsmoke#Radio series|Gunsmoke]]'' (first broadcast in 1952).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otrwesterns.com |website=otrwesterns.com |title=Old Time Radio Westerns |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319172946/http://www.otrwesterns.com/ |archivedate=2011-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Web series===
Westerns have been showcased in short episodic web series. Examples include ''[[League of STEAM]]'', ''[[Red Bird (web series)|Red Bird]]'' and [[Arkansas Traveler (web series)|''Arkansas Traveler'']].

'''October in Kragujevac Memorial Park''' ({{lang-sr|italic=yes|Spomen-park „Kragujevački oktobar"}}, Спомен-парк „Крагујевачки октобар"), also known as '''Šumarice Memorial Park''' (''Memorijalni park Šumarice'', Меморијални парк Шумарице), is the site near [[Kragujevac]], [[Serbia]] of the [[Kragujevac massacre|execution of an estimated 3,000 men and boys]] of the town by the [[Germany|German]] occupation forces on October 21, 1941, during [[World War II]]. 

According to noted historian [[Philip J. Cohen]], "All males from the town between the ages of sixteen and sixty were assembled and the victims -- including high school students -- were selected from among them."&lt;ref&gt;Philip. J. Cohen, "Serbia's Secret War", p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monument]]s within the [[park]] include the monument to the murdered schoolchildren and their teachers (the "Interrupted Flight" monument); the "Monument of pain and defiance"; the "One hundred for one" monument; the "Resistance and Freedom" monument, and the monument to shoe cleaners.

The 21 October Museum is located at the site of the massacre.
