The year '''1623 in [[music]]''' involved some significant events.

==Events==
* Drum [[cymbal]]s are first made commercially by the predecessor of the [[Avedis Zildjian Company]] at [[Constantinople]] in [[Ottoman Turkey]]. Zildjian {{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|ɪ|l|dʒ|i|ən}} cymbals were created in 1618 by Avedis Zildjian, an alchemist who was looking for a way to turn base metal into gold; he created an alloy combining tin, copper, and silver into a sheet of metal that could make musical sounds without shattering. Avedis was given the name of Zildjian (Zilciyân) by the Sultan Osman II[3] (from the Turkish word ''zil'' cymbal, ''dji'' maker/seller, ''-ian'' a common suffix used in Armenian last names) and begins an industry in this year, the details of whose main product remain secret for generations as it becomes family tradition that only the company's heirs would know the manufacturing process. The company will still be operating, from [[Massachusetts]], in the 21st century.

== Classical music ==
* [[Alessandro Piccinini]] – ''Intavolatura di liuto, et di chitarrone''
* [[Salamone Rossi]] – השירים אשר לשלמה (''Ha-shirim asher l'Shlomo'', The Songs of Solomon), a collection of Jewish liturgical music

==Opera==

The '''Ancha Icon of the Savior''', known in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] as '''Anchiskhati''' ({{lang-ka|ანჩისხატი}}), is a medieval Georgian [[encaustic painting|encaustic]] [[icon]], traditionally considered to be the ''Keramidion'', a "holy tile" imprinted with the face of [[Jesus Christ]] miraculously transferred by contact with the [[Image of Edessa]] (''Mandylion''). Dated to the 6th-7th century, it was covered with a [[chasing|chased]] silver [[riza]] and partly repainted in the following centuries. The icon derives its name from the Georgian [[Ancha monastery|monastery of Ancha]] in what is now [[Turkey]], whence it was brought to [[Tbilisi]] in 1664. The icon is now kept at the [[Art Museum of Georgia|National Art Museum of Georgia]] in Tbilisi.&lt;ref name="pravenc"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.pravenc.ru/text/75560.html Анчийский Спас] (''The Savior of Ancha''), «Православная энциклопедия» (2001),  Т. 3, С. 16-17 (''Orthodox Encyclopedia'', 2001, Vol. 3, pp. 16-17) [Online version]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karaulashvili|first=Irma|title=Artistic Interchange Between the Eastern and Western Worlds in the Medieval Period|year=2007|publisher=Penn State University Press|location=University Park, PA|isbn=978-0-9768202-4-6|pages=223–224|editor=Hourihane, Colum|chapter=The Abgar Legend Illustrated: The Interrelationship of the Narrative Cycles and Iconography in the Byzantine, Georgian, and Latin Traditions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Medieval Georgian sources identify the Ancha icon with the ''Keramidion'', a "holy tile" imprinted with the face of Christ miraculously transferred by contact with the ''[[Image of Edessa|Mandylion]]''. According to the Georgian hymnist Ioann, [[Bishopric of Ancha|bishop of Ancha]] (fl. 1195), the icon was brought in Georgia by [[Apostle Andrew]] from [[Hierapolis]]. An 18th-century inscription on the icon covering associates the Anchiskhati with the Image of Edessa, an "[[Acheiropoieta|icon not made by hand]]", brought to the cathedral of Ancha in the Georgian princedom of [[Klarjeti]] to preserve it from the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] campaign by the Byzantine emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]].&lt;ref name="pravenc"/&gt;

After the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the Georgian [[Principality of Samtskhe]], of which Klarjeti was part, in the 16th century, Christianity went in decline in the area. In 1664, the merchant Amirjan Ievangulishvili brought the icon of Ancha to Tbilisi, where it was acquired by the [[Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia|Georgian catholicos]] [[Domentius III of Georgia|Domenti III]] for 2,000 silver coins for the newly refurbished church of the [[Nativity of the Theotokos]] in Tbilisi, henceforth known as the [[Anchiskhati Basilica|Anchiskhati church]].&lt;ref name="CJSS1"&gt;Chichinadze, Nino (2008), [http://www.nplg.gov.ge/dlibrary/collect/0001/000945/CJSS%201.pdf "Precious metal revetments on Georgian medieval painted icons: some observations on a devotional practice"], in: ''Caucasus Journal of Social Sciences'', vol. 1, issue 1: pp. 261–262&lt;/ref&gt; The icon remained one of the most venerated relics of Georgian Christianity until after the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Soviet takeover of Georgia]] it was moved to the National Art Museum of Georgia in the 1920s. The Anchiskhati church was closed down and would only be reopened in the last years of the Soviet Union in the 1980s. Since then, there have been repeated calls from the Orthodox Christians to return the icon to the church’s property.&lt;ref name="pravenc"/&gt;

== Description == 
[[File:Анчийский Спас в Каннах.jpg|thumb|A copy of the Ancha icon at the Eastern Orthodox Church in [[Cannes]] in 2010.]]
Ancha Icon of the Savior is an encaustic icon dated to the 6th-7th century as it was identified by the detailed analysis by art historian [[Shalva Amiranashvili]] in the 1920s. By the end of the 12th century the icon was covered with gilded chasing by the Georgian master [[Beka Opizari]] at the behest of the bishop of Ancha, Ioann Rkinaeli, and the queen [[Tamar of Georgia]].&lt;ref name="Djobadze"&gt;[[Wachtang Djobadze|Djobadze, Wachtang Z.]] (1992), ''Early Medieval Georgian Monasteries in Historic Tao, Klarjet'i, and Šavšet'i'', p. 18. F. Steiner, {{ISBN|3-515-05624-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 14th century, the icon was converted into a [[triptych]] at the expense of the [[Jaqeli]] princes of Samtskhe. The chasing was amended several times and embellished with various inscriptions that date to the 12th, 14th, 16th, and 18th centuries. The 14th and 17th-century chasing of the lateral leaves depicts 12 scenes from the [[New Testament]], from the [[Annunciation]] to the [[Ascension of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="pravenc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CJSS1"/&gt;

The icon (105X71X4.6&amp;nbsp;cm without a ''kiot'', an icon box) is enclosed into the middle panel of the triptych so that only the face of the Savior remains visible. The silver chasing, remodeled in 1825, presents [[Christ Pantocrator]], while the original encaustic painting shows the bust of Jesus. The frame of the central panel is adorned with Beka Opizari's work, a high point of the medieval Georgian art. The two symmetrically located standing figures of [[John the Baptist]] and [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], combined with the icon of Jesus, creates the scene of ''[[deesis]]''. The [[archangel]]s [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]] and the [[apostles]] [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] can be seen in the corners of the frame.&lt;ref name="pravenc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CJSS1"/&gt;

'''''Chichester Canal''''' is a painting by the English [[Romantic art|Romantic]] [[landscape painter]], [[watercolour]]ist and [[printmaker]] [[J. M. W. Turner]]. It was painted in 1828&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-chichester-canal-n00560 Chichester Canal c.1828.] Tate Gallery, 2013. Retrieved 15 May 2013. [https://www.webcitation.org/6GdxZkekp Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; and was commissioned by [[George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont]]&lt;ref name=green42&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Chichester's Canal |last=Green |first=Alan H.J |year=2006 |publisher=Sussex Industrial Archaeology Society |isbn=0-9512036-1-4 | page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently housed in the [[Tate Collection]].

The work depicts the [[Chichester Canal]] in Sussex, southern England. The ship is probably a [[collier brig]], as this serene scene had commercial purpose. Its brilliant colours may have been influenced by atmospheric [[volcanic ash|ash]] from the eruption of [[Mount Tambora]] in Indonesia (see also [[Year Without a Summer]]).

'''''Cry-Baby''''' is a 1990 American [[Teen film|teen]] [[Musical film|musical]] [[romantic comedy]] film written and directed by [[John Waters]]. It was the only film of Waters' over which studios were in a bidding war, coming off the heels of the successful ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]''. The film stars [[Johnny Depp]] as 1950s teen rebel "Cry-Baby" Wade Walker, and also features a large [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Amy Locane]], [[Polly Bergen]], [[Susan Tyrrell]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[Ricki Lake]], and [[Traci Lords]], with appearances by [[Troy Donahue]], [[Joe Dallesandro]], [[Joey Heatherton]], [[David Nelson (actor)|David Nelson]], [[Willem Dafoe]], and [[Patricia Hearst]].

The story centers on a group of [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquents]] who refer to themselves as "drapes" and their interaction with the rest of the town and its other subculture, the "squares", in 1950s [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. "Cry-Baby" Walker, a drape, and Allison, a square, create upheaval and turmoil in their little town of Baltimore by breaking the subculture taboos and falling in love. The film shows what the young couple has to overcome to be together and how their actions affect the rest of the town.

Part of the film takes place at the now-closed [[Enchanted Forest (Maryland)|Enchanted Forest]] [[amusement park]] in [[Ellicott City, Maryland]]. Others take place in the historic neighberhoods and towns of [[Hampden, Maryland|Hampden]], [[Baltimore City]], [[Reisterstown]], [[Jessup, Maryland|Jessup]], [[Milford Mill, Maryland|Milford Mill]], and [[Sykesville, Maryland|Sykesville]], Maryland. The only scenes not filmed in Maryland were shot at [[Golden Oak Ranch]] in [[Santa Clarita Valley]].

The film did not achieve high audience numbers in its initial release, but has subsequently become a [[Cult film|cult classic]] and spawned a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Cry-Baby (musical)|musical of the same name]] which was nominated for four [[Tony Awards]].

==Plot==
In 1954 Baltimore, Wade "Cry-Baby" Walker is the leader of a gang of "[[Greaser (subculture)|drapes]]", which includes his sister Pepper, a teenage mother; Mona "Hatchet Face" Malnorowski, who is facially disfigured; Wanda Woodward, who is constantly embarrassed by her post World War II normal parents; and Milton Hackett, Hatchet Face's devoted boyfriend. Walker's ability to shed a single tear drives all the girls wild. One day after school, he is approached by Allison Vernon-Williams, a pretty girl tired of being a "square", and the two fall in love. &lt;!-- ("''Women in Cadillacs''", "''Gee!''"), --&gt;  That same day, Cry-Baby approaches the "square" part of town to a talent show &lt;!-- ("''[[Sh-Boom]]''", "''A Teenage Prayer''") --&gt; at the recreation center where Allison's grandmother hosts events, and introduces himself to her, who is skeptical of his motives. Cry-Baby invites Allison to a party at Turkey Point, a local hangout spot for the drapes.

Despite her grandmother's skepticism, Allison accompanies Cry-Baby to Turkey Point and sings with the drapes&lt;!-- ("''King Cry-Baby''") --&gt;. As Cry-Baby and Allison tell each other about their orphan lives; Cry-Baby's father was sent to the [[electric chair]] after being the "Alphabet Bomber" – a killer who bombed places in alphabetical order and his mother tried to stop him, but also got sent to the electric chair as a result; Allison's parents took separate flights to avoid orphaning her if they crashed, but both their planes went down.  Allison's jealous square boyfriend, Baldwin, then starts a riot. Cry-Baby is blamed for the fight and sent to a [[Prison|penitentiary]], outraging all his friends and even Allison's grandmother, who is impressed by Cry-Baby's posture, manners, and musical talent. &lt;!-- ("''Teardrops Are Falling''") --&gt;

As Lenora Frigid, a loose girl with a crush on Cry-Baby, but constantly rejected by him, claims to be pregnant with his child, Allison feels betrayed and returns to Baldwin and the squares, though her grandmother advises her against rushing into a decision. &lt;!-- ("''Doin' Time Bein' Young''") --&gt; Meanwhile, in the penitentiary, Cry-Baby gets a [[teardrop tattoo]]. He tells the tattoo artist, fellow drape Dupree (Robert Tyree): "I've been hurt all my life, but real tears wash away. This one's for Allison, and I want it to last forever!".

Eventually after performing with Baldwin and the Whiffles&lt;!-- ("''[[Mr. Sandman]]''") --&gt;, Allison is persuaded by the newly established alliance between the Drapes and her grandmother to stand by Cry-Baby and join the campaign for his release&lt;!-- ("''Please, Mr. Jailer''") --&gt;. Cry-Baby is released, but immediately insulted by Baldwin, who after revealing that his grandfather is the one who electrocuted Cry-Baby's father, challenges him to a [[Chicken (game)#Popular versions|chicken race]]. &lt;!-- ("''High School Hellcats''") --&gt; Cry-Baby wins, as Baldwin chickens out, and is reunited with Allison.

The film ends with all watching the chicken race crying a single tear, except for Allison and Cry-Baby, who has finally let go of the past, enabling him to cry from both eyes.

*''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]]'' (2017): After purchasing a wax replica of Harding from the closed Hall of Presidents and First Ladies in [[Pennsylvania]], the show presented a fake, satirical trailer for a biographical film about Harding, using the wax figure to portray the President while other cast members humorously act around it.

&lt;!-- DO NOT add the Daily Show skit here. See discussion at Talk:Warren G. Harding. --&gt;

==Music==
* [[Al Stewart]]'s song "Warren Harding" (from his 1973 album ''[[Past, Present and Future (Al Stewart album)|Past, Present and Future]]'') satirizes Harding's predicament by contrasting his fall with the rise of an immigrant bootlegger.

==Literature==
* In a poem written on the subject of Harding's death, [[E. E. Cummings]] ridiculed the late President as&lt;ref&gt;Poem XXVII, from {{cite book |title=ViVa |year=1931 |publisher=H.

* In the [[alternate history]] short story "A Fireside Chat" by Jack Nimersheim contained in the [[anthology]] ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'', Harding dies from a stroke during the [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920 election campaign]]. This eventually leads to the election being won by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[James M. Cox]] and his running mate [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. However, five weeks after the election, President-elect Cox was assassinated by an anti-[[League of Nations]] activist, meaning that Roosevelt took office as the 29th President on March 4, 1921.

'''Elmore John Leonard Jr.''' (October 11, 1925{{snd}}August 20, 2013) was an American novelist, short story writer, and screenwriter. His earliest novels, published in the 1950s, were [[Western fiction|Westerns]], but he went on to specialize in [[crime fiction]] and [[Suspense (genre)|suspense thriller]]s, many of which have been adapted into motion pictures.

Among his best-known works are ''[[Get Shorty]]'', ''[[Out of Sight (novel)|Out of Sight]]'', ''[[Swag (novel)|Swag]]'', ''[[Hombre (novel)|Hombre]]'', ''[[Mr. Majestyk]]'', and ''[[Rum Punch]]'' (adapted as the movie ''[[Jackie Brown]]''). Leonard's writings include short stories that became the films ''[[Three-Ten to Yuma|3:10 to Yuma]]'' and ''[[The Tall T]]'', as well as the [[FX (network)|FX]] television series ''[[Justified (TV series)|Justified]]''.

==Early life and education==
Leonard was born in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], the son of Flora Amelia (née Rive) and Elmore John Leonard, Sr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title = Elmore Leonard Jr.|date = January 31, 2011|encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Louisiana|accessdate = 2013-08-21|publisher = Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities|url = http://www.knowla.org/entry/518/|deadurl = no|last = Ells|first = Kevin|publication-date = August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because his father worked as a site locator for [[General Motors]], the family moved frequently for several years. In 1934, the family settled in [[Detroit]].

&lt;!--collapse synthesis lacking references:
In the 1930s, two major events occurred that would influence many of his works.{{cn|date=August 2013}} [[Gangsters]] such as [[Bonnie and Clyde]] were making national headlines, as were the [[Detroit Tigers]] baseball team. From about 1931 until they were killed in May 1934, Bonnie and Clyde were on a rampage. The Tigers made it to the [[World Series]] in 1934, winning the Series in 1935. Leonard developed lifelong fascinations with both sports and guns.--&gt;He graduated from the [[University of Detroit Jesuit High School]] in 1943 and, after being rejected for the Marines for weak eyesight, immediately joined the Navy, where he served with the [[Seabees]] for three years in the [[Seabees in World War II#The Pacific theater|South Pacific]] (gaining the nickname "Dutch", after pitcher [[Dutch Leonard (left-handed pitcher)|Dutch Leonard]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite podcast|url = http://www.maximumfun.org/blog/2007/07/podcast-tsoya-elmore-leonard.html|accessdate = 2013-08-21|title = Podcast: TSOYA: Elmore Leonard|host = [[Jesse Thorn]]|website = [[Maximum Fun]]|date = July 3, 2007|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Enrolling at the [[University of Detroit]] in 1946, he pursued writing more seriously, entering his work in short story contests and sending it off to magazines. He graduated in 1950&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; with a bachelor's degree in English and philosophy. A year before he graduated, he got a job as a [[copy writer]] with Campbell-Ewald Advertising Agency, a position he kept for several years, writing on the side.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.randomhouse.com/features/elmoreleonard/about/|title = Elmore Leonard &gt; About the Author|accessdate = 2013-08-21|publisher = [[Random House]]|deadurl = no}}

==Career==
{{expand section|date=October 2014}}
Leonard got his first break in the fiction market during the 1950s, regularly publishing [[pulp magazine|pulp]] Western novels. Leonard had his first success in 1951 when ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'' published the short story "Trail of the Apaches".&lt;ref name="tap"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Get Dutch! : a biography of Elmore Leonard|last = Challen|first = Paul C.|publisher = [[ECW Press]]|isbn = 1550224220|oclc = 44674355|year = 2000|location = Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|29}} During the 1950s and early 1960s, he continued writing [[Western fiction|Westerns]], publishing more than 30 short stories. He wrote his first novel, ''The Bounty Hunters'', in 1953 and followed this with four other novels. Five of his westerns were turned into major movies before 1972:&lt;ref name="el-imdb"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001465/ "Elmore Leonard"], IMDb.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Tall T]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051047/ "The Tall T (1957)"], IMDb.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Randolph Scott]]), ''[[3:10 to Yuma (1957 film)|3:10 to Yuma]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050086/ "Trein van tien over drie (1957)"], IMDb.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Glenn Ford]]), ''[[Hombre (film)|Hombre]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061770/ "Hombre (1967)"], IMDb.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Paul Newman]]), ''[[Valdez Is Coming]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067921/ "Valdez Is Coming (1971)"], IMDb.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Burt Lancaster]]), and ''[[Joe Kidd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068768/ "Joe Kidd (1972)"], IMDb.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Clint Eastwood]]).

He went on to write seventeen novels and stories in the [[Mystery fiction|mystery]], crime, and more topical genres which were made into movies between 1969 and 2013.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In 1985, his breakout novel, ''[[Glitz (novel)|Glitz]]'' was published. At the time of his death he had sold tens of millions of copies of his novels.&lt;ref name="freep"&gt;"Novelist elevated crime thriller, mastered dialogue"; Julie Hinds; Detroit Free Press; August 21, 2013; page A1&lt;/ref&gt;

Among film adaptations of his work are ''[[Jackie Brown]]'' (starring [[Pam Grier]], directed by [[Quentin Tarantino]]) which is a "homage to the author’s trademark rhythm and pace";&lt;ref name="freep"/&gt; ''[[Get Shorty (film)|Get Shorty]]'' (1995, [[John Travolta]] and [[Gene Hackman]]); and ''[[Out of Sight]]'' (1998, [[George Clooney]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]], directed by [[Steven Soderbergh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/20/showbiz/elmore-leonard-obit/index.html | work=CNN | title=Elmore Leonard, writer of sharp, colorful crime stories, dead at 87 - CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He married Beverly Clare Cline in 1949, and they had five children together—three daughters and two sons&lt;ref name="BookJacket"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Comfort to the enemy and other Carl Webster tales|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Comfort_to_the_Enemy.html?id=UqIsAQAAIAAJ|last = Leonard|first = Elmore|isbn = 0297856685|oclc = 302068307|accessdate = 2013-08-20|publisher = [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]]|year = 2009|location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;—before divorcing in 1977.  His second marriage in 1979, to Joan Leanne Lancaster (aka Joan Shepard), ended with her death in 1993.

Leonard spent the last years of his life with his family in [[Oakland County, Michigan]]. He suffered a [[stroke]] on July 29, 2013. Initial reports stated that Leonard was recovering,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Elmore Leonard in hospital recovering from stroke |date=August 5, 2013 |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130805/ENT06/308050096 |last=Whitall |first=Susan |work=[[The Detroit News]] |accessdate=2013-08-21 |deadurl=yes |department=Entertainment |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824154921/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130805/ENT06/308050096 |archivedate=August 24, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; but on August 20, 2013, Leonard died at his home in the [[Detroit]] suburb of [[Bloomfield Hills]] of stroke complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azstarnet.com/gallery/entertainment/books-and-literature/photos-elmore-leonard/collection_fc8e312a-05e3-11e3-85dc-0019bb2963f4.html |title=Photos: Elmore Leonard dies |work=[[Arizona Daily Star]] |date=August 20, 2013 |accessdate=2013-08-21|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was 87 years old.&lt;ref name=DetroitObit/&gt; Leonard is survived by his five children, 13 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name="NYT Obit" /&gt;

==Writing style==
Commended by critics for his gritty [[realism (arts)|realism]] and strong dialogue, Leonard sometimes took liberties with [[English grammar|grammar]] in the interest of speeding the story along.&lt;ref name="tenrules"/&gt; In his essay "Elmore Leonard's Ten Rules of Writing" he said: "My most important rule is one that sums up the 10: If it sounds like writing, I rewrite it."  He also hinted: "I try to leave out the parts that readers tend to skip."&lt;ref name="tenrules"&gt;{{cite news|last=Leonard|first=Elmore|title=Writers on Writing; Easy on the Adverbs, Exclamation Points and Especially Hooptedoodle|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/16/arts/writers-writing-easy-adverbs-exclamation-points-especially-hooptedoodle.html|accessdate=2013-08-20|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 16, 2001|department = Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elmore Leonard has been called "the [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] of Detroit" because of his intimate portraits of people from that city, though he said, "If I lived in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], I'd write about Buffalo."&lt;ref name="tap" /&gt;{{Rp| 90}}  His favorite epithet was one given by Britain's ''[[New Musical Express]]'': "the poet laureate of wild assholes with revolvers".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/10255566/Elmore-Leonard.html The Telegraph, 20 August 2013]. Retrieved 22 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; His ear for [[dialogue]] has been praised by writers such as [[Saul Bellow]], [[Martin Amis]], and [[Stephen King]]. "Your prose makes [[Raymond Chandler]] look clumsy," Amis told Leonard at a [[Writers Guild of America, West|Writers Guild]] event in [[Beverly Hills]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite interview|last = Leonard|first = Elmore|interviewer = [[Martin Amis|Amis, Martin]]|title = Martin Amis interviews Elmore Leonard|date = January 23, 1998|url = http://www.martinamisweb.com/interviews_files/amis_int_leonard.pdf|format = PDF|accessdate = 2013-08-21|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130409202557/http://www.martinamisweb.com/interviews_files/amis_int_leonard.pdf|archivedate = 2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen King has called him "the great American writer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The Tao of Steve|date = February 1, 2007|url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,472359,00.html|last = King|first = Stephen|authorlink = Stephen King|work = [[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate = 2013-08-21|deadurl = no|publication-date = August 8, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Charles Rzepka of Boston University, Leonard's mastery of [[free indirect speech|free indirect discourse]], a third-person narrative technique that gives the illusion of immediate access to a character's thoughts, "is unsurpassed in our time, and among the surest of all time, even if we include Jane Austen, Gustave Flaubert, and Hemingway in the mix." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Rzepka| first = Charles|title = ''Being Cool: The Work of Elmore Leonard''|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year= 2013|location= Baltimore| page= 21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SaY-AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonard often cited [[Ernest Hemingway]] as perhaps his single most important influence, but at the same time criticized Hemingway for his lack of humor and for taking himself too seriously.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[[Mark Lawson]], [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/20/novelist-elmore-leonard-60-years-publishing "Best-selling novelist Elmore Leonard, master of verbal tics and black humour"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', August 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Still, it was Leonard's affection for Hemingway, as well as [[George V. Higgins]], that led him to will his personal papers to the [[University of South Carolina]], where many of Hemingway's and Higgins' papers are archived.  Leonard's papers reside at the university's Irvin Department of Rare Books and Special Collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Elmore Leonard’s Papers (and Hawaiian Shirts) Go to University of South Carolina|date = October 16, 2014|url = http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/elmore-leonards-papers-and-hawaiian-shirts-go-to-university/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=From 'Get Shorty' to 'Glitz:'10000000002 USC acquires collections of crime novelist Elmore Leonard |date=October 15, 2014 |url=http://www.thestate.com/2014/10/15/3746411_from-get-shorty-to-glitz-usc-acquires.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204220538/http://www.thestate.com/2014/10/15/3746411_from-get-shorty-to-glitz-usc-acquires.html |archivedate=December 4, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Elmore Leonard archive goes to South Carolina|date = October 15, 2014|url = http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/books/2014/10/15/elmore-leonard-archives-university-south-carolina-detroit-crime-author/17299509/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthroposophy}}
'''Eurythmy''' is an expressive [[performing art|movement art]] originated by [[Rudolf Steiner]] in conjunction with [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers|Marie von Sivers]] in the early 20th century. Primarily a performance art, it is also used in [[pedagogy|education]], especially in [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]], and&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; as part of [[anthroposophic medicine]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; for claimed therapeutic purposes.&lt;ref name=qw/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heusser/&gt;

The word ''eurythmy'' stems from Greek roots meaning ''beautiful'' or ''harmonious rhythm''.

==Movement repertoire==
The [[gesture]]s in the eurythmist's movement repertoire relate to the sounds and rhythms of speech, to the tones and rhythms of music and to "soul experiences", such as joy and sorrow. Once these fundamental repertoire elements are learned, they can be composed into free artistic expressions. The eurythmist also cultivates a feeling for the qualities of straight lines and curves, the directions of movement in space (forward, backward, up, down, left, right), contraction and expansion, and color. The element of color is also emphasized both through the costuming, usually given characteristic colors for a piece or part and formed of long, loose fabrics that accentuate the movements rather than the bodily form, and through the lighting, which saturates the space and changes with the moods of the piece.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;

Eurythmy's aim is to bring the artists' expressive movement and both the performers' and audience's feeling experience into harmony with a piece's content;&lt;ref name="Willmann"&gt;Carlo Willmann, ''Waldorfpädogogik'', Böhlau Verlag, {{ISBN|3-412-01898-8}}, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; eurythmy is thus sometimes called "visible music" or "visible speech", expressions that originate with its founder, [[Rudolf Steiner]], who described eurythmy as an "art of the soul".

Most eurythmy today is performed to [[European classical music|classical (concert) music]] or texts such as [[poetry]] or stories. Silent pieces are also sometimes performed.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;

===Eurythmy with music===
When performing eurythmy with music (also called ''tone eurythmy''), the three major elements of music, [[melody]], [[harmony]] and [[rhythm]], are all expressed.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;  The melody is primarily conveyed through expressing its rise and fall; the specific [[pitch (music)|pitches]]; and the [[interval (music)|intervallic qualities]] present.  Harmony is expressed through movement between tension and release, as expressions of dissonance and consonance, and between the more inwardly directed minor mood and the outwardly directed major mood.  Rhythm is chiefly conveyed through livelier and more contoured movements for quick notes, slower, dreamier movements for longer notes; in addition, longer tones move into the more passive (listening) back space, quicker tones into the more active front space.

Breaths or pauses are expressed through a larger or smaller movement in space, giving new impulse to what follows.  Beat is conveyed through greater emphasis of downbeats, or those beats upon which stress is normally placed.  Beat is generally treated as a subsidiary element. Eurythmy has only occasionally been done to popular music, in which beat plays a large role.

The timbre of individual instruments is brought into the quality both of the tonal gestures and of the whole movement of the eurythmist.  Usually there will be a different eurythmist or group of eurythmists expressing each instrument, for example in chamber or symphonic music.

A piece's [[choreography]] usually expresses elements such as the major or minor key, the shape of the melody line, the interplay between voices or instruments and the relative dominance of one or another voice or instrument.  Thus, musicians can often follow even the finest details of their part in the movements of the eurythmists on stage.  Particular musical forms (e.g. the [[sonata]]) can have special characteristic choreographic expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. McDermott, ''The Essential Steiner'', {{ISBN|0-06-065345-0}}, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eurythmy with spoken texts===
Eurythmy is often performed with spoken texts such as poetry, stories or plays. ''Speech eurythmy'' includes such elements as the [[phoneme|sounds of speech]], [[rhythm]]s, poetic [[meter (poetry)|meter]]s, [[grammar]] and mood. In speech eurythmy, all the sounds of language have characteristic gestural qualities: the sound of an 'A' is open due to the position of the articulators during the vowel. A 'k' sounds sharper due to the manner of articulation of the consonant, that it is a plosive. Note that it is the audible sounds themselves, not the letters of the written language, that are expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{npsn|date=April 2014}}[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Eurhythmy/19230826p01.html Steiner on eurythmy.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Eurythmy was conceived in 1911 when a widow brought her young daughter, Lory Smits, who was interested in movement and dance, to the [[Austria]]n [[philosopher]] [[Rudolf Steiner]]. Due to the recent loss of her father, it was necessary for the girl to find a career. Steiner's advice was sought; he suggested that the girl begin working on a new art of movement. As preparation for this, she began to study human anatomy, to explore the human step,  to contemplate the movement implicit in Greek sculpture and dance, and to find movements that would express spoken sentences using the sounds of speech. Soon a number of other young people became interested in this form of expressive movement.

During these years, Steiner was writing a new drama each year for performance at the [[Anthroposophical Society]]'s summer gatherings; beginning in 1912, he began to incorporate the new art of movement into these dramas. When the Society decided to build an artistic center in [[Dornach]], [[Switzerland]] (this later became known as the [[Goetheanum]]) a small stage group began work and offered weekly performances of the developing art. [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers]], Steiner's wife, who was a trained actress and speech artist, was given responsibility for training and directing this ensemble. This first eurythmy ensemble went on tour in 1919, performing across [[Switzerland]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="Stott"&gt;Alan Stott, ''Eurythmy: its Birth and Development'', {{ISBN|0-9541048-4-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner saw eurythmy as a unique expression of the [[anthroposophy|anthroposophical]] impulse:
{{quote|It is the task of Anthroposophy to bring a greater depth, a wider vision and a more living spirit into the other forms of art. But the art of Eurythmy could only grow up out of the soul of Anthroposophy; could only receive its inspiration through a purely Anthroposophical conception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Eurhythmy/19230826p01.html Rudolf Steiner's "Lecture on Eurythmy" August 26, 1923]&lt;/ref&gt;|Rudolf Steiner}}

According to Steiner: ''In eurythmy we present in the form and movement of the human organism a direct external proof of a man's share in the life of the supersensible world. When people do eurythmy they are linked directly with the supersensible world. Whenever art is formed from a truly artistic conviction it bears witness to the connection of the human being with the supersensible world.'' (Dornach, 12 September 1920) &lt;ref&gt;Biesantz/Klingborg, The Goetheanum: Rudolf Steiner's Architectural Impulse (London, 1979), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Steiner gave two intensive workshops on different aspects of eurythmy; transcripts of his talks during these workshops are published as ''Eurythmy as Visible Speech'' and ''Eurythmy as Visible Singing''.

Eurythmy ensembles in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]] and at the Goetheanum soon became established parts of the cultural life of Europe. The Goetheanum ensemble was recognized with a gold medal at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|Paris Expo]] of 1937/8. The Stuttgart training and ensemble, led by [[Else Klink]], had to close in the [[Nazism|Nazi]] period but reopened shortly after the close of [[World War II]]. There are now training centers and artistic ensembles in many countries.&lt;ref name="Stott"/&gt;

===Etymology===
The word ''eurythmy'' stems from Greek roots meaning ''beautiful'' or ''harmonious rhythm''. The term was used by Ancient Greek and Roman architects to refer to the harmonious proportions of a design or building;&lt;ref&gt;Matila Ghyka, ''The Geometry of Art and Life'', Sheen and Ward, NY 1946, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The English word ''eurythmy'' was used from the 17th to 19th century to refer not only to harmonious architectural proportions, but also to "rhythmical order or movement" and "a graceful proportion and carriage of the body".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/65086 "Eurhythmy"], Oxford English Dictionary, accessed 1/14/14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eurythmy as a performing art==
There are notable eurythmy ensembles in [[Dornach]], [[Switzerland]]; [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]]; [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]; [[London]], [[England]]; [[Järna]], [[Sweden]], and [[Chestnut Ridge, New York]] (near [[New York City]]). All of these groups both perform locally and tour internationally. Many smaller performing groups also exist [http://www.eurythmie-info.de/Buehnen.htm (see list)]. High schools that have their own performing ensembles include the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120313232919/http://www.sfwaldorf.org/high-school/arts/eurythmy-troupe San Francisco Waldorf High School ensemble].

==Pedagogical eurythmy==
When the first [[Waldorf School]] was founded in 1919, eurythmy was included in the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Stockmeyer, ''Rudolf Steiner's Curriculum for Waldorf Schools'', Steiner Schools Fellowship, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; It was quickly recognized as a successful complement to [[gymnastics]] in the school's movement program and is now taught in most Waldorf schools, as well as in many non-Waldorf pre-school centers, kindergartens and schools. It is taught to all ages from pre-schools through high school and into college. Its purpose is to awaken and strengthen the expressive capacities of children through movement, stimulating the child to bring [[imagination]], [[Ideation (idea generation)|ideation]] and [[concept]]ualization to the point where they can manifest these as "vital, moving forms" in physical space.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt; It is also thought to improve balance, coordination, concentration, rhythm, and form an awareness of patterns.

Eurythmy pedagogical exercises begin with the straight line and curve and proceed through successively more complicated geometric figures and choreographed forms, developing a child's coordination and concentration. An extensive set of special exercises has also been developed for pedagogical purposes.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt; These include metamorphosing geometric patterns and dynamic movement sequences.

Rods or balls are sometimes used in exercises to develop precision in movement, to expand the experience of space, develop precise balance, and to objectify the movement experience. The rods are usually approximately the length of an arm; the balls are of a size to fit comfortably in one hand. Both are generally made of copper, a material receptive to warmth.

Though there are some independent post-graduate trainings for pedagogical eurythmy, this aspect is frequently included in courses focusing on artistic work.

According to the precepts of anthroposophic medicine, a human has four aspects which need to be treated: spirit, soul, life and matter.&lt;ref name=Heusser/&gt; Eurythmy is one of the practices said to act on the "life" aspect, and is claimed to effect an "improvement of health related life functions".&lt;ref name=Heusser/&gt; A person receiving eurthymy therapy moves under the guidance of a eurythmy therapist, who will have been trained two years beyond the four-year fundamental course in eurythmy.

'''Family folklore''' is the branch of [[folkloristics]] concerned with the study and use of [[folklore]] and traditional [[culture]] transmitted within a family group. This includes items of material culture, crafts produced by family members or memorabilia saved as reminders or remainders of significant family events. It also includes family photos and photo albums in paper and electronic format, along with bundles of other pages held for posterity: certificates, letters, journals, notes and shopping lists. Family stories and sayings, originally recounting actual events, are told and retold until the historical facts give way to a distilled expression of common identity. Family customs are performed, modified, forgotten, created or resurrected with alarming frequency; each time with the goal of defining and solidifying the perception of this family as unique, distinct and different from other families.

Family folklore has long been included in the documentation of the folklore of regional, ethnic, religious or occupational groups.&lt;ref name="FamilyFolklore"&gt;Margaret R. Yocum (1997). "Family Folklore", pg. 279. In ''Folklore An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'', ed. Thomas Green. California / ABC-CLIO.&lt;/ref&gt; It is only since the 1970s that this lore has also been investigated as a defining element of the family group itself. Heralded by a call from Mody Boatright to document the "family saga" in 1958,&lt;ref name="Boatright"&gt;Mody C. Boatright (1958). "The Family Saga as a Form of Folklore". In ''The Family Saga and Other Phases of American Folklore'', eds. Mody C. Boatright, Robert B. Downs, and John T. Flanagan. Urbana / University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; folklorists responded with published accounts of stories and traditions passed down in their own families.&lt;ref name="Garrett"&gt;Kim S. Garrett (1961), "Family Stories and Sayings", pp 273–281. In ''Publications of the Texas Folklore Society'', Vol. XXX.&lt;/ref&gt; L. Karen Baldwin’s unpublished dissertation (1975)&lt;ref name="Baldwin"&gt;L. Karen Baldwin (1975). ''Down on Bugger Run: Family Group and the Social Base of Folklore''. University of Pennsylvania / Unpublished Dissertation. &lt;/ref&gt; laid further theoretical groundwork for family folklore "… not only is the family a folk group, it is the first folk group anyone belongs to."&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;Polly Stewart (2008), "Karen Baldwin (1943 - 2007)", pp. 485–486. In ''Journal of American Folklore'', Vol. 121, Fall 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field has since blossomed, broadening to include an ever expanding understanding of family. The conventional extended family, consisting of a heterosexual married couple with children and grandparents now incorporates gay partners, unmarried committed relationships and children adopted or born through non-traditional methods and procedures. The family traditions themselves are transformed to meet the needs and expectations of these new members and new relationships. 

The study of family folklore is distinct from family [[genealogy]] or family history. Instead of focusing on historical dates, locations and verifiable events, its unique stories, customs and handicrafts identify the family as a distinct social group. At the same time, the family lore passed along has been molded and transformed to relay a sense of family identity and set of values both within and without the family group. The family lore defines the family story.  
&lt;blockquote&gt;For an individual family, folklore is its creative expression of a common past. As raw experiences are transformed into family stories, expression, and photos, they are codified in forms which can easily be recalled, retold, and enjoyed. Their drama and beauty are heightened, and the family’s past becomes accessible as it is reshaped according to its needs and desires. … Its stories, photographs, and traditions are personalized and often creative distillations of experience, worked and reworked over time.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin"&gt;Steven J. Zeitlin, Amy J. Kotkin, and Holly Cutting Baker (1993). ''A Celebration of American Family Folklore: Tales and Traditions from the Smithsonian Collection'', pg. 2. Cambridge / Yellow Moon. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Family as a folk group ==
A new baby is born or a child is adopted into an established [[family]] group, which contains a microcosm of social alignments found in many larger groups: the vertical relationship between grandparents and grandchildren, the horizontal relationship between siblings and cousins of a generation or age group, clusters of girls or boys and skill-based family alliances.&lt;ref name="Toelken"&gt; [[Barre Toelken]] (1996). ''The Dynamics of Folklore'', pp 196–197. Utah / Utah State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sims"&gt; Sims, Martha C., Martine Stephens (2005). ''Living Folklore'', pg 31. Utah / Utah State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The child grows up in this family, sees and learns the family lore as it is performed throughout the seasons and the life cycle. Not only is the family the first folk group of the child, it is "the group in which important primary folkloric socialization takes place and individual aesthetic preference patterns for folkloric exchange are set."&lt;ref name="FamilyFolklore" /&gt;

The dynamics of family folklore remain unsettled not only through the addition of newborns and adoptions, but more particularly by the regular incorporation of new adult family members through each marriage or committed relationship. In the formation of each new family node, a unique subset and combination of the customs and traditions of both families is incorporated into a new story, both modifying and enriching the current family lore. 

As part of the ongoing national discussion of "family" and what it means, family folklore redefines itself as well. Along with the classic family "father-mother-child(ren)", it expands to include single-parent families, blended families, communes, gay and lesbian families. The indicator for family now includes any group which self-identifies as a family based on intimacy, shared space and shared history. Any collection of adults and children in a committed relationship which sees itself as "us", unique and separate from other families, will develop and transmit stories and customs which are unique. Non-traditional families frequently strive to re-establish and re-enact traditional family customs and lore. This becomes a demonstration both to themselves and to outsiders that they are indeed a family of "tradition".

== Transmission ==
The transmission of individual stories and customs within a family depends for the most part upon the personality, character, and lifestyle of individual family members. It is not normally passed along as part of a defined family role. As a family reshapes itself around each birth, death, marriage and other life events, individual members elect to pick up items of family lore to own and perform. This might be learning a skill, telling a story (or story cycle) or baking a traditional pie for the Thanksgiving table. The transmission of individual items can picked up by several different family members, for example when several grown siblings use a family recipe or tradition in their own households. This type of transmission through multiple individuals was first described in an article by Dégh and Vázsonyi as "multi-conduit transmission".&lt;ref name="Dégh"&gt;Linda Dégh and Andrew Vázsonyi (1975). "Hypothesis of Multi-Conduit Transmission in Folklore", pp. 207–255. In ''Folklore. Performance and Communication'', ed. Dan Ben-Amos. Den Haag, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; By choosing to own a piece of the family lore, a family member signifies that this tradition embodies beliefs and values to which he adheres. By successfully transmitting it further within the family, these beliefs and values come to define the family.   

There are multiple spheres within the family and household which are "traditionally" defined as in the purview of one gender or the other, making an intersection with [[gender studies]] manifest. The transmission of the folklore in these areas will run through either the male or the female lines. An obvious area of gender-related transmission is seen in the kitchen, where food preparation and mealtime customs and forms are generally performed by the women. They are then transmitted from mother to daughter in the course of everyday meal preparation. A variant of this is seen when a man in the family has taken over the preparation of a special meal or special recipe. One common example of this practice is described by Thomas Adler in the article "Making Pancakes on Sunday: The Male Cook in Family Tradition".&lt;ref name="Adler"&gt;Thomas A. Adler (1981). "Making Pancakes on Sunday: The Male Cook in Family Tradition", pp. 45–55. In ''Western Folklore'', Vol. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Many families have some variation of this tradition: the BBQ ribs, grilled hamburgers, or deep-fat fried turkey prepared as a single specialty by the non-cook in the family.

A different gender-related variation in folklore transmission is seen in storytelling. The same story will be shaped and told differently by a man and a woman, even though they were both present at the original event. For an event occurring during the apple harvest, a woman’s narration might include details of the apple butter recipe they were cooking up at the time. In contrast, the man's narration gives only enough detail to "make a point worth telling". This gender-based variance has been studied by both Baldwin and Margaret Yocum within individual family groups. They found "… women's telling to be more collaborative, interruptible, and filled with information and genealogy; men's telling, by contrast, is often uninterrupted and more competitive."&lt;ref name="FamilyFolklore2"&gt; Margaret Yocum, Family Folklore, pg. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within families, there is also a notable tendency toward traditional deference where one family member becomes the designated performer for a specific custom or tradition, even though it is known to everyone within the family group. So it happens that when the "last basketmaker" dies, another member will step up to become "the last basketmaker".&lt;ref name="Toelken" /&gt; No one else performs this tradition as long as the designated tradition bearer is available, acknowledging this individual as the (current) keeper of this tradition. Only when this person is no longer available will the tradition be picked up by someone else to carry forward. "Traditional deference" can be found in many folk groups, but is particularly evident within the family group.

== Detritus of family lore ==
If the family lore which is picked up and transmitted represents the chosen familial beliefs and values, then family stories, documents and photographs which do not support and enhance these values become problematic. For the most part news clipping on arrests, photographs of the uncle who deserted the family, stories of a sister who cheated, or dishonorable discharge papers will not be saved. That is not the family story this family wants to preserve. 

Family traditions are also lost or modified in response to difficult events within the family. This is obvious when one of the tradition bearers has died. If no one else steps up to own that tradition, a hole is left in the celebration and this tradition is lost. In a divorce there is also frequently the loss of a parent no longer available to play his or her role in the established traditions. In response to this event, one family decided to change the traditions. The customary tall Christmas tree decorated by the (missing) tall father was traded in for a short tree which the children could decorate. Ornaments were discarded and new ones purchased. The toy train was no longer set up.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, pg 170.&lt;/ref&gt; These became the new traditions for the Christmas celebration, modified to support and tell the new family story. 

Another reason family folklore might be suppressed or lost is when the references are too painful at the present time or to the present generation. When Catherine Noren found photo albums and other old family portraits in her grandmother’s attic, she unwittingly unearthed an entire family history of a prosperous German-Jewish family before the Holocaust. It became her task, one generation removed, to explore and record the family history in a book containing photos, diaries and memories of her family history.&lt;ref name="Noren"&gt;Catherine Noren (1976). ''The Camera of My Family''. New York / Knopf, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; It is only because these albums and portraits had not been discarded along with the narrative that Noren came to know her family story.

== Forms ==
It is only since the 1970s that family folklore has been investigated as a defining element of the family group itself. As part of this investigation, the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] in Washington, D.C. set up a tent for several years&lt;ref&gt;From 1974–1978&lt;/ref&gt; to collect the family lore of visitors to the Festival. The goal was to establish an archive of family folklore as part of the Smithsonian collections. Using the taped interviews collected, representative pieces have been published in the book ''A Celebration of American Family Folklore: Tales and Traditions from the Smithsonian Collection''.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin" /&gt; Despite its lack of performance data, this collection provides a solid overview of the wide range of family folklore forms. 

=== Family stories and sayings === 
A '''family story''' initially recounts an actual historical event concerning named family members. Seasoned with time and re-telling, the story gets revised and honed to express specific values and character traits valued in the family. Instead of historical accuracies, the narration becomes a medium to re-state and re-enforce shared values of the family group. These stories generally take the form of an [[anecdote]] and follow the pattern of many common traditional tales.&lt;ref&gt;For further examples including traditional heroes, rogues, survivors, migrants and more, see Zeitlin, pp. 10–125.&lt;/ref&gt; A favorite family story involves how the parents met, or how they decided on the one true partner among several. In one family, if the story is to be believed, the prospective bride had to untie all the knots in the string to demonstrate her care and diligence.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, pg. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Another family tells how the young couple got stuck at the top of a Ferris wheel when he proposed, and she had to either say yes or jump.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, pg. 96. &lt;/ref&gt; Given time and repetition, the anecdotes serve to shape the family story as a whole, populating it with real individuals and historical events made personal. In their transmission, these stories serve to codify the norms of behavior within the family.

The setting for telling family stories becomes part of the tradition. It can include the family occasions where stories are told, the location and prompt for the storytelling, the family members who initiate the session as well as the designated raconteurs and custodians of the stories.  Each of these elements needs to be documented along with the stories themselves as an integral part of the storytelling tradition within this family. In one family following the holiday meal, the men would retire to the study and the women would move into the kitchen. At some point in the cleanup, usually after the best dishes had been washed and put away, the mother would bring out a bottle of schnapps to help complete the work. This became the trigger for family stories and jokes, the laughter from the kitchen frequently bringing the men to join in the storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;Told by the Riedel family from Freiburg, Germany. Recorded October 2014 &lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of verbal lore common within family groups is the unique '''family expression''' or [[saying]]. A saying can be created at any time; it starts as a one-time utterance of a family member to capture a single moment. Through repetition, this then becomes a shorthand reference to both the original and the current situation. In one family, the saying "… good worker, very strong" signifies that the speaker wants to come along, and would in fact be a value-add to the planned undertaking. This expression originally referenced a first move of the family, a move that current family members took no part in.&lt;ref&gt;Told by the Wiley family from Seattle. Recorded June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the saying has become code words for all family members, used to communicate encrypted commentary on the present as well as re-enforce and strengthen the family’s shared experience and history.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, pg. 146 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photos, letters, journals and other papers ===
Papers stacked, bundled or boxed: news clippings, photographs, letters, scrawled notes, journals, receipts. These pages of family artifacts take many forms, and have become a significant part of family archival materials. Frequently jumbled together in cardboard boxes, they commonly pose a problem as to their value-add to the family story. The boxes are passed along until they are either thrown out in a move, destroyed in a fire, or find an owner within the family,&lt;ref name="Dégh"/&gt; someone with the interest and time to house and evaluate them. 

The largest collection of papers is frequently the photographs, either kept in a drawer or labeled and organized into albums. Singly each photo documents only a single moment; taken together they comprise an important visual history of the family. Either way, they serve as triggers for more extensive memories, stories and events in the life of this family. They are brought out at gatherings and used to commemorate lifetime events such as a wedding or funeral. 

Noteworthy is the consistency in which American families of all ethnic backgrounds tend to have photographs of the same milestones. Naked babies on carpets or in the wading pool, the first day of school, the birthday cake surrounded by family and guests, generational portraits gathered around the new baby can be found in many family albums.&lt;ref&gt;see Zeitlin, pg. 184 ff&lt;/ref&gt; This pictorial repetition by American families of all backgrounds and traditions documents the universality of family photography as an important custom. 

As with storytelling, the occasion for photo-taking becomes a family tradition in and of itself. Year after year, the same pictures are snapped; documenting a family which is growing and changing, adding and subtracting members, detailing a new location. The camera can be as much a part of the celebration as the birthday cake or the menorah.  

The ubiquity of cameras and on-line photos since the rise of cellphone cameras and personal websites is actively changing the tradition of family photos and photo albums. The availability of video recordings and teleconferencing allows for a daily log of family growth and minutiae to be saved and transmitted to family near and far, in real time. Grandparents can get a daily or weekly update on children's growth or milestone events. Family members can video-conference with each other, making geographic distance much less significant in family relations. A new family custom, using the technology of today, is to put together a slideshow or video documenting the story leading up to the current celebration. At this time a folklorist can only speculate on evolving customs of family photography.   

Some families have also amassed over decades a collection of letters and other papers written by or about family members. One family, in sorting through boxes of papers, discovered all diplomas for family members from 2nd grade Sunday School up through doctoral degrees. Other family documents include the family Bible, military enlistment or discharge papers and Certificates of Baptism. While certificates authenticate the dates and events in the family history, letters and journals are particularly revealing as to the character and thoughts of individual family members. 

Similar to photographs, letters and journal entries document a single day in the life of a family member. Once these papers have been saved, it falls to members of the following generations to evaluate them. Are they to be preserved as part of the family story or discarded as inconsequential or even damaging to the family? For the most part unfavorable documents are discarded; that is not the family story this family wants to save.

The introduction of emails, IMs and other electronic messaging means that paper documents of family history are no longer regularly generated. Seldom is electronic communication printed out for the family files. The 19th and 20th centuries, providing access both to widespread literacy and to resources to create and preserve paper documents might mean that these forms of family history and lore are themselves becoming history.

=== Family customs ===
Each family has its own traditions, played out year after year, event after event. These traditions are frequently so engrained that the recognition of them as unique to this family only occurs when compared to other families.  This is also an area of family folklore that is most exposed to change or modification. With each additional marriage or committed relationship, a new member from a different family gets added, an individual who does not recognize the family customs as "traditional". These new members bring their own traditions which need to be reconciled, perhaps added or even substituted into the current performance. Not only through marriage, but births and deaths also add a fluid dynamic to the family traditions. When the first grandchild is born, everyone moves into a new role, Mom becomes Grandmom, Brother becomes Uncle, and the family Benjamin loses his position to the new baby. These factors lead to a dynamic development of new and renewed family traditions. 

One major and understudied area of family traditions is found in [[foodways]], which includes everything involved in the procurement, preparation, serving and eating of daily meals at home.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Owen Jones (1983). ''Foodways and Eating Habits: Directions for Research Paperback''. California Folklore Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[American Folklore Society]] has a section dedicated completely to Foodways. Many other scholarly groups also consider the study of food traditions as part of their domain, including Gender Studies, Ethnic Studies, Ethnology as well as modern findings on [[Nutrition and Health]]. &lt;/ref&gt; Most of us go home each evening for dinner, wake up for breakfast and pack up a lunch or snack pack to take with us for the day. All the assumptions about how this occurs, who does what when arise only when the established process (i.e. family custom) hits a snag: we've run out of milk or someone ate the last of the cookies. Maybe Dad is off on a trip and can't make the Sunday morning pancakes.&lt;ref name="Adler"/&gt; Each of these food customs is understood and accepted by the group as a whole, and followed as a matter of course with little or no discussion. 

It is also customary that family mealtimes differ: breakfast food differs from supper and snacks, weekends frequently vary from the weekday diet. In one busy family a scoop of ice cream on the breakfast cereal turned the meal into an easy, fun supper. There might also be a traditional Sunday Dinner to be prepared and staged weekly with an expanded family group gathered around the table. 

Holidays and "life event" celebrations, from birthdays to wakes include multiple family customs, either superimposed upon the more broadly defined societal celebrations, or substituting for them. This is seen most obviously in traditions found in the preparation and "performance" of a holiday meal. Each family has their own unique traditions, from special dishes prepared only for this dinner, to a single individual who prepares and presents this single dish, to the individual assigned to carve the bird. It is unnecessary to mention examples of this; each North American reader is mentally reviewing the [[Thanksgiving]] traditions unique to his own family. This list of special holiday traditions in the family expands easily from the dining table to the family wake-up calls to the distribution of presents under the Christmas tree or Hanukah lights. Each of these, along with countless other details, distinguish this family as a unique social unit.  

Another significant family tradition is that of naming customs. When a new baby is born, incorporating family names into the name for the new baby, or conversely not using family names for the next generation, can become problematic. What rules should be followed? Many ethnic groups have their own naming customs, variations of which might be found within the separate family groups of the parents. There are also differing ethnic customs of who has the authority to pick the name for the baby. When published lists of currently popular names along with expectations of individual family members are added to this mix, it can become a challenge to craft a name which pleases everyone.  

=== Handicrafts and memorabilia ===
All possessions are considered pieces of [[material culture]] - objects with which members of a culture customarily surround themselves. However, only handicrafts produced by family members and memorabilia passed along through generations are of interest in family folklore. 

[[Memorabilia]] are singular objects which are passed down through the family with the stories and memories about events or individuals attached to them. In one family a doll, given once as a Christmas present, continued to be brought out each year to celebrate Christmas and have her picture taken with the (changing) family. For her hundredth birthday, a birthday cake for the doll was included in the Christmas celebration.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, pg. 203. &lt;/ref&gt; Like the doll, almost any object imbued with family stories and memories can become a family [[heirloom]]. As such, it holds in the family a value often unrelated to its monetary value. As the stories and memories enveloping the object are slowly lost, the object itself becomes a simple hand-me-down, usually in poor condition and ready to be discarded.

[[Handicrafts]] are objects which have been "homemade", crafted individually using simple tools by one or more family members. The production skills for these artisanal crafts are generally transmitted within the family; the items might include weaving, welding, pottery, woodworking, quilting, basketry, cooking. They can be used functionally or as decoration in the home. Over time these handicrafts becomes a skill nurtured within the family, as well as a point of family identification for outsiders. The family cultivates both the production knowledge and the objects themselves. 

One aspect of these objects, both family memorabilia and handicrafts, is that they are for the most part one-of-a-kind. Many family members can tell the story of the Christmas doll, or have the family photographs, but only one family branch can actually possess the doll. For handicrafts, a craftsman could decide to create a quilt or a rocking chair for each child in a family. But this just postpones the decision of ownership of the item to the following generation.  

Each of these material objects carries along with its stories or memories the ability for family members to experience [[simultaneity]] in the home. "…by gathering around ourselves treasured objects from different times of our lives and our histories, we experience different eras at the same moment and in some way bring the totality of the past to bear upon the present."&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, pg. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; The family history and identity is preserved and transmitted, both for the family member who walks past the bowl sitting on the counter, and the outsider who asks about the origin of the unique item. "The artifacts that family members make, use, or display can be an unseen backdrop to the duties and demands of family life. Alternatively, they might be carefully crafted statements about the values and expectations of family tradition bearers."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3406900153.html Jill Terry Rudy &lt;/ref&gt; The candy bowl on the coffee table or the silver tea service set out in the dining room speak of an elegance of hospitality which is customary in this family. 

== Institutions involved in study of family folklore == 
=== [[Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage]] ===
1967 marked the first [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]], set up on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. to exhibit and demonstrate crafts and customs of diverse ethnic, regional and occupational groups. Originally including only displays from the United States, it later expanded to include traditions and customs from around the world. Each exhibit at the festival endeavors to move beyond the items of tangible culture, the arts and objects we can touch, feel and put in a glass case. Each unique performance or display at the Folklife Festival articulates the goal of the Smithsonian Institution to spread its reach beyond material objects to artifacts of [[intangible cultural heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.folklife.si.edu/cultural-heritage-policy/ICH/about/smithsonian &lt;/ref&gt; Festival exhibits such as "The Changing Soundscape in Indian Country" (1992), "American Social Dance" (1993), "Mississippi Delta" (1997), "Asian Pacific Americans: Local Lives, Global Ties" (2010) are just a few of the exhibits included since the Festival began.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.festival.si.edu/explore_festival/year.aspx Complete list of programs by year]&lt;/ref&gt; Any of these cultural intangibles, including traditions of performance, ritual, music, dance, traditional knowledge, storytelling or oral transmission, is considered for inclusion at the festival. Its intention is to "legitimize and celebrate individual Americans and their traditions".&lt;ref name="Zeitlin 272"&gt;Zeitlin, pg. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; Open to the public at no cost, the festival is devised to enable each visitor to find at least one exhibit which relates to his background, narrates a segment of his story.
	
In 1974 a new tent was added to the Festival. Instead of displaying or performing recognized traditions, its goal was to collect items of family folklore from visitors. This tent was unique at the festival in asking visitors to be active contributors to the folklife on display instead of merely receptive spectators. A sign at the tent was hopeful: "Family Folklore – Will You Share Yours With Us?"&lt;ref name="Zeitlin 272"/&gt;  Card tables with checkered table clothes were set up, tape recorders and folklore interviewers on hand to prompt, listen and record family lore which visitors might share. Not only should each visitor see himself somewhere in the exhibits, but he should also recognize and record parts of his own story as a unique and valued artifact of cultural heritage. 

During the four years that the tent was included at the festival, it gradually cluttered with objects, memorabilia and photos just like any family home. Taking the taped interviews as a baseline, the stories and customs collected in the tent were used to establish an archive of family folklore as part of the Smithsonian collections. Representative pieces were then published in the book ''A Celebration of American Family Folklore: Tales and Traditions from the Smithsonian Collection''.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin" /&gt; This collection continues to be supported by the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage&lt;ref&gt;http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/pictures/center-folklife-and-cultural-heritage&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Folklife Center]] at the Library of Congress. 

Since this first Smithsonian Folklife Festival, many [[List of folk festivals#USA|regional festivals]] have been established in all parts of the country. These include the [[Northwest Folklife]] Festival, the [[New England Folk Festival]] and the [[Philadelphia Folk Festival]] to name just a few.  Each of these is supported by various institutions of [[public folklore]], with the goal of displaying traditions of regional, ethnic and occupational folk groups. None of them however has duplicated the Smithsonian Folklore tent intended to collect original family folklore.

=== Oral history and oral tradition projects ===
[[Oral history]] and [[oral tradition]] first became recognized as legitimate forms of historical and cultural research in the 1960s and early 1970s. Pioneers in this field used newly developed inexpensive tape-recorders to record oral histories.  A Pulitzer Prize was awarded to [[Studs Terkel]] in 1985 for his book ''"The Good War": An Oral History of World War II'' and a special Pulitzer Prize was awarded to [[Alex Haley]] in 1977 for ''Roots: The Saga of an American Family''. With these awards, the importance of oral histories and traditions as a bona fide tool of historical and cultural research was cemented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/oral+history "Oral history"] ''Columbia Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical and folklore research using oral interviews has gone mainstream, with multiple organizations dedicated to its collection. One of the best known organizations is [[StoryCorps]], founded in 2003 and modeled on the WPA [[Federal Writers Project]]. Its expressed mission is to "record, preserve, and share stories of Americans from all backgrounds and beliefs". Special projects reach out to targeted populations to fulfill StoryCorps' commitment to record a diverse array of voices. The only requirement for the 2-person interview is that the 2 participants "care about each other", for instance family members. The participants are given a recording of the interview to take with them and add to the family archive. 

StoryCorps is just one of many organizations with a goal of recording and preserving interviews of oral history and tradition. Other organizations abound, such as [[City Lore]] of New York City and the [[Oral History Society]] of London.

'''''Fluxus 1''''' is an [[Artist's Book|artists' book]] edited and produced by the [[Lithuanian-American]] artist [[George Maciunas]], containing works by a series of artists associated with [[Fluxus]], the international collective of avant-garde artists primarily active in the 1960s and 1970s. Originally published in New York, 1964, the contents vary from edition to edition, but usually contain work by [[Ay-O]], [[George Brecht]], [[Alison Knowles]], [[György Ligeti]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]] and [[La Monte Young]] amongst many others.&lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Harry N Abrams p110&lt;/ref&gt;

The work has become famous as an early example of [[conceptual art]], and as one of the defining products of the Fluxus collective.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lib.stanford.edu/art-architecture-library/fluxus-1 Stanford University Online Retrieved 07-06-09]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early fluxus==
[[Image:AnthologyFlynt.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A single page from ''An Anthology'', by La Monte Young and Jackson Mac Low, 1963. Designed and printed by George Maciunas.]]

===The AG Gallery and proposals for a Yearbox===
Maciunas had originally set up the AG Gallery, 925 [[Madison Avenue]], [[New York City]], to exhibit abstract art and to sell ancient musical instruments; upon meeting [[La Monte Young]] and [[Richard Maxfield]] in late 1960, however, he 'was suddenly confronted with the most radical ideas in art.' Overnight, the gallery  was transformed into a greenhouse for 'the germination of Fluxus',&lt;ref&gt;''Fluxus Codex'', Hendricks, Harry N Abrams p22&lt;/ref&gt; hosting events by [[Dick Higgins]], [[Jackson Mac Low]], [[Yoko Ono]], La Monte Young and others. All of these artists would be included in the forthcoming ''Fluxus 1''; the first known mention of the name ''Fluxus'' came on the invitation cards to 3 events held at the gallery, Spring 1961, in which guests were asked to contribute $3 to 'help publish Fluxus magazine'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ass/fluxone.htm The Assault on Culture, Stuart Home]&lt;/ref&gt;

The gallery had gone bankrupt by mid 1961; to avoid his creditors, Maciunas took a job working for the US Army as a freelance designer in [[Wiesbaden]], West Germany. He took many of the scores collected by La Monte Young for ''AN ANTHOLOGY'', and whilst working on the design and printing for that, also began work on his own anthology ''Fluxus 1''. Modelled in many ways on An Anthology, both works would prove difficult to publish. ''AN ANTHOLOGY'' appeared in Spring 1963; Most of Fluxus 1 was printed by the same German printers contemporaneously, but Maciunas doesn't seem to have put any copies together until sometime in early 1964, by which time he'd left his job in Germany due to bad health and had returned to New York. His letters leave a paper trail of torturous dealings with German printers;

{{quote|''Fluxus 1'' deadline is now closed, (all works are at the printer who is scratching his head to the bone.) It should be out in Jan ...|George Maciunas, Dec 2 1962 &lt;ref name="print"&gt;quoted in Fluxus Codex, p107-8&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

{{quote|''Fluxus 1'' $2000 (now 400 pages thick) is 80% completed - very slow printer! but I think I will have them ready end of March ...|George Maciunas, March 11, 1963 &lt;ref name="print"/&gt;}}

{{quote|... I will stay in Wiesbaden till Printer completes Fluxus 1 ... (2 printers are working now.) They should have it completed by June 15 ...|George Maciunas, before June 8, 1963 &lt;ref name="print"/&gt;}}

{{quote|Please accept our belated acknowledgement of your order for ''Fluxus 1'' yearbook. Due to financial difficulties, this fat book will not be issued but the contents will be included in the monthly Fluxus newspaper ...|George Maciunas, Nov 19, 1963 &lt;ref name="print"/&gt;}}

{{quote|''FLUXUS 1964 EDITIONS, AVAILABLE NOW ... Fluxus 1'' Anthology of yet unpublished works ... Loose leaf binding (nonperiodically renewable), with objects in wood box $6|Fluxus Newspaper no3, March 1964 &lt;ref name="print"/&gt;}}

Originally intended as a six-part series of yearboxes covering America (1), Northern Europe (2), Japan (3), 'Homage To The Past' (4), Southern Europe (5) and Eastern Europe (6), only ''Fluxus 1'' was actually published; whilst predominantly anthologising American artists, both European and Japanese artists were included from material that had originally been intended for other volumes in the series. The book originally sold for $6, with a 'Luxus Fluxus' edition costing $12 containing 'film, tape, objects and accessories' &lt;ref&gt;cc Valise e TRanglE, Fluxus Newspaper no3, march 1964 quoted in Fluxus Codex, p108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluxus, collectivism &amp; Anti-art===
Amongst many other influences, Maciunas was directly inspired by [[LEF (journal)|LEF]], the communist journal founded by [[Mayakovsky]] and [[Ossip Brik]]; an artistic organisation aimed at unifying left-wing artists to help build the newly emerging communist state in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;"Fluxus objectives are social (not aesthetic). They are connected to the group of LEF group of 1929 (sic) in Soviet Union (ideologically) and concern itself with: Gradual elimination of fine arts (music, theatre, poetry, fiction, painting, sculpture etc. etc.) ... Thus Fluxus is definitely against art-object as non-functional commodity - to be sold &amp; to make livelihood for an artist. It could temporarily have the pedagogical function of teaching people the needlessness of itself. It should not be therefore permanent ...
Fluxus therefore is ANTIPROFESSIONAL (against professional art or artists making livelihood from art or artists spending their full time, their life on art.) Secondly FLUXUS is against artas medium or vehicle promoting artist's ego, since applied art should express the objective problem to be solved not artist's personality or his ego. Fluxus should therefore tend towards collective spirit, anonymity and ANTI-INDIVIDUALISM ..... 
These Fluxus concerts, publications etc - are at best transitional (a few years) &amp; temporary until such time when art can be totally eliminated (or at least its institutional forms) and artists find other employment." George Maciunas, January 1964 Quoted in Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Harry N Abrams p37&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fluxus 1'' was Maciunas' first attempt at creating a coherent collective voice, an attempt to erode the artist's status as heroic individual &amp; his first attempt to 'communicate the concept of the self-sufficiency of the audience, an art where anything can substitute for an art work and anyone can produce it.' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10457 Michael Corris from Grove Art Online, quoted on MOMA online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a lecture given on the June 9, 1962, [[Wuppertal]], West Germany, to coincide with the launch of the ''Brochure Prospectus for the Fluxus Yearboxes'', Maciunas stated that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The anti-art forms are primarily directed against art as a profession, against the artificial separation of producer or performer, of generator and spectator or against the separation of art and life. They oppose forms artificial in themselves, models or methods of composition, of artificially constructed phenomena in the various areas of artistic practice, against intentional, conscious formalism and against the fixation of art on meaning, against the demand of music to be heard and that of plastic art to be seen; and finally against the thesis that both should be acknowledged and understood. Anti-art is life, nature; true reality is the one and all. The bird song is anti-art. The pouring rain, the chattering of an impatient audience, sneeze noises ... or compositions like "letting a butterfly caught in a net fly away" or "what an audience left to its own devices does for amusement"- all of these examples may be viewed in this sense as anti-art.&lt;ref&gt;Maciunas, Kleinen Sommerfest lecture June 9, 1962, quoted in Fluxus Codex p23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Maciunas sent out requests for 'critical or non-critical, rational or irrational essays'; scores, instructions ... visual compositions for reproductions, collages, photographs ... solid objects, scraps, smears, junk, garbage, rags, ready-makes (sic), found objects ... or an object (like a flat painting) cut into 200 parts.' &lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Codex, p104&lt;/ref&gt; As the yearbox developed, Maciunas became increasingly interested in what he referred to as 'Concretism', derived from [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp's]] ideas about the '[[readymade]]'. In effect, concretism refers to works that don't attempt to transform themselves; objects such as George Brecht's ''Exit'' that remains resolutely a sign indicating the exit.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The best Fluxus 'Composition' is a most non-personal, 'readymade' one like Brecht's 'Exit'—it does not require any of us to perform it since it happens daily without any 'special' performance of it. Thus our festivals will eliminate themselves (and our need to participate) when they become total readymades (like Brecht's exit) &lt;ref&gt;[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/__FSXbtt4Jv4/RyDip8DbmhI/AAAAAAAAAGU/oseRlklVgic/s320/brecht_exit.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The book itself==
[[Image:AFavoriteSong.jpg|thumb|left|250px|2 versions of a single page from ''Fluxus 1'', ''A Favorite Song'' by Joe Jones, next to a version of the same from a copy of the slightly later ''Fluxkit''. These copies in the Silverman collection.]]
The book consists of a number of envelopes bound together by metal bolts, each containing printed works by a single artist. Some copies have the names of the works and of the artists printed onto the envelopes; others are hand-stamped. There is a printed folded sheet attached featuring Maciunas' typographic representations of each artist's name, and the whole book is contained in a wooden case sprayed with the title. The box was used, in part, to facilitate sending the work by post. A number of copies have the recipient's address written directly onto the cover.

Contents might include: a ''Finger Envelope'' by Ay-O featuring an envelope with a slit in it containing a nylon stocking; ''A Favorite Song'' by [[Joe Jones (Fluxus artist)|Joe Jones]] containing 'a scramble of used music typewriter ribbons';&lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Codex, p279&lt;/ref&gt; ''Disappearing Music for Envelopes'' by Mieko Shiomi consisting of a sequence of envelopes of diminishing sizes within each other; the music score for ''Trois Bagatelles'' by Györgi Ligeti; or ''An Opera'' (see [http://www.artnotart.com/fluxus/ewilliams-anopera.html]), a short story written on a long scroll by [[Emmett Williams]].

Copies of ''Fluxus 1'' were assembled over a period of 13 years, and whilst the form and much of the content remained fairly stable, 'Maciunas' attitude toward certain artists and/or works in the anthology changed, some works got lost or mislaid, and others ran out of stock.' &lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Codex, p110&lt;/ref&gt; Marginal figures in Fluxus, such as [[Giuseppe Chiari (artist-composer-philosopher)|Giuseppe Chiari]] and Sohei Hashimoto, were dropped in favour of artists such as Yoko Ono and the Hi Red Center, whilst [[Dick Higgins]] is noticeable by his absence after a feud with Maciunas over the setting up of the [[Something Else Press]].

There are thought to be more than a hundred boxes manufactured between 1964 and 1977 in New York, and a further one hundred or so pieced together in [[Amsterdam]] by Willem De Ridder, for sale in the european Flux Mail Order Shop.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lib.stanford.edu/art-architecture-library/fluxus-1 Stanford University Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sims and Reed, quoting Philpot and Hendricks, [http://www.abebooks.co.uk/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=7787669833&amp;searchurl=bt.x%3D0%26bt.y%3D0%26kn%3Dfluxus%2B1%26sortby%3D1 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinese scholar's rock - Gongshi.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gongshi (Scholar's rock) in [[Wen Miao, Shanghai|Wenmiao temple, Shanghai]]]] 

'''''Gongshi''''' ({{zh|s=供石}}), also known as '''scholar's rocks''', are naturally occurring or shaped [[rock (geology)|rocks]] which are traditionally appreciated by Chinese scholars.&lt;ref name="metropolitan"&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art, [http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2000/world-of-scholars  "The World of Scholars' Rocks Gardens, Studios, and Paintings"]; retrieved 2012-12-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars' rocks can be any color, and contrasting colors are not uncommon. The size of the stone can also be quite varied: scholars' rocks can weigh either hundreds of pounds or less than one pound.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Shanghai Center, [http://www.spirit-stones.com/2010/11/26/harvard-shanghai-centers-scholar-stone/ "Scholar Stone"]; retrieved 2012-12-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The term also identifies stones which are placed in traditional [[Chinese garden]]s.

==History==
In the [[Tang dynasty]], a set of four important qualities for the rocks were recognized.  They are: thinness (shou), openness (tou), perforations (lou), and wrinkling (zhou).&lt;ref name="metropolitan"/&gt;

Chinese scholar's rocks influenced the development of Korean ''[[Korean stone art|suseok]]'' and Japanese ''[[suiseki]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brokaw, Charles. (2011). [https://books.google.com/books?id=T51TNiU9460C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=  ''The Temple Mount Code,'' p. 73].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
[[File:Gelehrtenstein Museum Rietberg RCH 167.jpg|thumb|right|Lingbi stone from Anhui. Ming Dynasty, 15th century]]
There are three main Chinese sources for these stones.
* [[Lingbi stone]] (''Lingbishi'') from [[Lingbi County|Lingbi]], [[Anhui]] province, limestone&lt;ref name="cousins246"&gt;Cousins, Craig. (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=7w-arIGpmfEC&amp;pg=PA246&amp;dq=  ''Bonsai Master Class,'' p. 246].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lingbistone"&gt;[http://www.lingbistone.org/ Lingbi Stone and Asian Art Collection]. (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Taihu stone]] (''Taihushi'') from [[Lake Tai]], [[Jiangsu]] province, limestone&lt;ref name="cousins246"/&gt;
* [[Yingde stone]] (''Yingshi'' or ''Yingdeshi'') from [[Yingde]], [[Guangdong]] province, limestone&lt;ref&gt;Cousins, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7w-arIGpmfEC&amp;pg=PA247&amp;dq=  p. 247].&lt;/ref&gt;

The geological conditions needed for the formation of stones are also present at some other sites.&lt;ref&gt;https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70020774&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261680877_Underwater_dissolutional_pitting_on_dolostones_Lake_Huron-Georgian_bay_Ontario&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
Scholar's stones are generally [[karst|karstic limestone]]. [[Limestone]] is water-soluble under some conditions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nps.gov/cave/planyourvisit/upload/cave_geology.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dissolution pitting]] dissolves hollows in the limestone. On a larger scale, this causes [[speleogenesis]] (when caves dissolve in limestone [[bedrock]]). On a still larger scale, the dissolved caves collapse, gradually creating [[karst topography]], such as the famous landscapes of [[Guilin]] in the [[South China Karst]].

As rocks are broadly [[Fractal#Natural_phenomena_with_fractal_features|fractal]] (geology journals require a scale to be included in images of rocks), the small rocks can resemble the larger landscape.

'''Hermann Struck ''' (6 March 1876 – 11 January 1944) was a [[German Jewish]] artist known for his etchings.&lt;ref name="lbi"&gt;[http://www.lbi.org/exhibitions.html Exhibitions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Land Israel by Hermann Struck (5058192938).jpg|thumb|Jaffa]]
 
Hermann Struck (Chaim Aaron ben David) was born in [[Berlin]]. He studied at the Berlin Academy of Fine Arts. In 1904, he joined the [[modern art]] movement known as the [[Berlin Secession]].&lt;ref name="lbi"/&gt;
In 1900, Struck met [[Jozef Israëls]], a Dutch artist, who became his mentor. Both were recognized as leading artists of their time.&lt;ref name="hat"&gt; "Here and There" Smadar Sheffi, ''Haaretz Guide'', March 7, 2008, review of Herman Struck retrospective: Master Print Maker,Open Museum, Tefen Industrial Park, Israel&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, Struck published "Die Kunst des Radierens" ("The Art of Etching"), which became a seminal work on the subject.&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt;It was a textbook that offered both theory and practical instruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mushecht.haifa.ac.il/art/Artist-Collection-eng.aspx?id=40 Hecht Museum: Hermann Struck]&lt;/ref&gt;Struck's students included [[Marc Chagall]], [[Lovis Corinth]], [[Jacob Steinhardt]], [[Lesser Ury]] and [[Max Liebermann]].&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt;
[[File:Hermann Struck Grafik JMBerlin GDR 87 2 0.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Theodore Herzl]]]]

In 1899, upon completing his studies at the Berlin Academy, he was banned from teaching there because he was Jewish. He signed his work with his Hebrew name, Chaim Aaron ben David, and a [[Star of David]].&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt;{{dubious|The Jaffa etching shown here is signed "Struck" and bears a red emblem (stamp?) "HS". Maybe there is also "Chaim Aaron ben David" written smaller somewhere. Anyway, NOT an accurate statement. Also, the Herzl portrait is signed "Hermann Struck fecit" on the margin, and there is a ''shin'' and a Star of David inside the picture.|date=January 2017}} Struck did commissioned portraits of [[Ibsen]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Freud]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Theodor Herzl|Herzl]], [[Oscar Wilde]] and other leading figures of the time.&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt;

Struck was a fervent [[Zionist]] and Jewish activist. He visited the [[Land of Israel]] in 1903, displayed his art at the Fifth [[Zionist Congress]], and was a founder of the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi Religious Zionist movement]]. At the same time, he was a German patriot and volunteered for military service in World War I&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt; serving as a translator, liaison officer and military artist.&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt; He was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] 1st Class and promoted to an officer for bravery, in 1917 he became the referent for Jewish affairs at the [[Ober Ost|German Eastern Front High Command]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwRouKYzapsC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=wilhelm+von+gayl&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=gayl&amp;f=false|title=The art and artists of the fifth Zionist Congress, 1901: heralds of a new age|accessdate=2009-08-25 |work= |publisher= Gilya Gerda Schmidt |year=2003 |date= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Struck immigrated to Palestine in 1922, taught at [[Bezalel Academy]] and helped establish the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt; He visited Berlin every summer until the Nazis rose to power.&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt;

'''Holly Near''' (born June 6, 1949 in [[Ukiah, California|Ukiah]], California) is an American singer-songwriter, actress, teacher, and activist.&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/holly-near-mn0000579909/biography|title=Holly Near-Biography|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|year=2011|website=AllMusic.com|access-date=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

Holly Near was born in Ukiah, California, in 1949&lt;ref name="Hollybio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollynear.com/bio.html|title=Holly Near - Biography|website=www.hollynear.com|access-date=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was  
raised on a ranch&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"/&gt; in [[Potter Valley, California]].&lt;ref name="ukiahdailyjournal.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ukiahdailyjournal.com/article/ZZ/20141117/NEWS/141110959|title=Holly Near honored for Women's History Month|work=Ukiah Daily Journal|access-date=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was eight years old when she first performed publicly,&lt;ref name="ukiahdailyjournal.com"/&gt; and she auditioned for [[Columbia Records]] when she was ten.&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"/&gt; She sang in all the high school musicals, talent shows and often was invited by local service groups to sing at their gatherings. Groups like the Soroptimist Club, Lions Club, and Garden Club. Her senior year she played Eliza Doolittle in Ukiah High School production of ''My Fair Lady''.  In the summer Holly attended performing arts camps such as Perry-Mansfield in Colorado and Ramblerny Performing Arts where she studied with jazz musicians Phil and Chan Woods and modern dancer/choreographer Joyce Trisler.

After starting high school in 1963, Holly Near began singing with three boys who called themselves the Freedom Singers, a folk group modeled after the Kingston Trio.  When Holly joined, they began to sound more like [[The Weavers]], three male voices and one female. Near learned later of the original [[Freedom Singers]] who sang as part of the Civil Rights Movement. Unbeknownst to her, Holly would soon meet one of the founding members of that group, [[Dr. Bernice Johnson Reagon]], an artist who would be a great influence for the next 40 + years. She would also meet and work with the female singer in [[The Weavers]], [[Ronnie Gilbert]].

After high school, Near  enrolled in the Theatre Arts program at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]];&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"/&gt;  her freshman year she got the lead in the UCLA  production of ''Guys and Dolls''  playing soprano Sarah Brown. Because Near was trained in a lower range she got nodules on her vocal chords and had to leave the show.  She entered in to a long period of silence until her voice healed. After one year, she left UCLA and began to work in film and television as well as with anti war groups such as [[Another Mother for Peace]].

==Career==
[[File:Holly Near Performs at March For Women's Lives 2004.jpg|thumb|Holly Near Performs at March For Women's Lives 2004 – Photograph by Patty Mooney]]
Holly Near's professional career began in 1969 with a part on the television show ''[[The Mod Squad]]'', which was followed by appearances in other shows, such as ''[[Room 222]],'' ''[[All in the Family]],'' and ''[[The Partridge Family]].''  She also appeared in films such as [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five (film)|Slaughterhouse-Five]]'', and ''[[Minnie and Moskowitz]]'',&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"/&gt; and had a prominent role in the 1991 film ''[[Dogfight (film)|Dogfight]]''.

She was briefly a member of the musical comedy troupe, "First National Nothing", and appeared on the troupe's only album, ''If You Sit Real Still and Hold My Hand, You Will Hear Absolutely Nothing'' ([[Columbia Records]] – LP C 30006).

In 1970, Near was a cast member of the [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] [[musical theater|musical]] ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''. Following the [[Kent State shootings]] in May of that year, the entire cast staged a silent vigil in protest. The song, "It Could Have Been Me" (which was released on ''A Live Album,'' 1974), was her heartfelt response to the shootings. In 1971, she joined the [[Free The Army tour|FTA (Free The Army) Tour]], an [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War]] road show of music, comedy, and plays that performed for soldiers, many of whom were resisting war and racism from within the military.  The tour was organized by antiwar activist [[Fred Gardner (activist)|Fred Gardner]] and actors [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Donald Sutherland]].  Near was only 21 and the youngest member of the troupe.

In 1972, Near founded an independent record label called Redwood Records to produce and promote music by "politically conscious artists from around the world".&lt;ref name="Hollybio"/&gt; She was one of the first women to found an independent record company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwhp.org/2015-national-womens-history-month-honorees/|title=2015 Theme and 2015 National Women’s History Month Honorees - National Women's History Project|website=www.nwhp.org|accessdate=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near's record company went out of business in the mid-1990s due to financial difficulties.&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"/&gt;

During her long career in folk and [[protest song|protest music]], Holly Near has worked with a wide array of musicians, including [[Ronnie Gilbert]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], [[Mercedes Sosa]], [[Bernice Johnson Reagon]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[Meg Christian|Meg (Shambhavi) Christian]], [[Cris Williamson]], [[Linda Tillery]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[Harry Belafonte]], and many others, as well as the Chilean exile group [[Inti-Illimani]]. Holly Near has been recognized many times for her work for social change, including honors from the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]], the [[National Lawyers Guild]], the [[National Organization for Women]], [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences|NARAS]], ''[[Ms. Magazine]]'' (Woman of the Year), and the Legends of Women's Music Award. In 1989 Holly Near received a Dr of Humane Letters at  World College West in California.

Near wrote an autobiography in the early nineties called ''Fire in the Rain, Singer in the Storm''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Holly Near| title=Fire in the Rain, Singer in the Storm: An Autobiography| isbn=978-0-688-08733-3| year=1990| publisher=W. Morrow| location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, with her sister Timothy, Near co-wrote a one-woman show based on the stories in the book. The show was presented at [[San Jose Repertory Theatre|The San Jose Rep]] and in Los Angeles at The [[Mark Taper Forum]], as well as productions in San Francisco and off Broadway in NYC. In April 2004, Holly performed at the March for Women's Lives in Washington, DC where she sang "We Are Gentle Angry People" and "Fired Up" a capella. The following year, Near was named among the "1000 Women for the Nobel Peace Prize".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://1000peacewomen.org/eng/friedensfrauen_biographien_gefunden.php?WomenID=583| title=Holly Near| publisher=1000peacewomen.org| accessdate=2008-07-19| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130223042344/http://1000peacewomen.org/eng/friedensfrauen_biographien_gefunden.php?WomenID=583| archivedate=February 23, 2013| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near continues an active tour schedule and {{As of|2012|lc=on}} had a discography of 29 albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hollynear.com/discography.html| title=Discography| website=www.hollynear.com|access-date=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is still active as a performer and composer, and she has begun issuing CDs available through her website that include tracks from her out-of-print albums. Her song "Singing For Our Lives" appears in ''Singing the Living Tradition'', the official hymnal of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]], under the title "We Are A Gentle, Angry People" (Hymn #170).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://uucboulder.org/services/music_tradition.html| title=Music in the UU Tradition—Unitarian Universalist Church of Boulder, Colorado| publisher=uucboulder.org| accessdate=2008-07-19| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007052358/http://uucboulder.org/services/music_tradition.html| archivedate=October 7, 2007| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hymn was also performed by Quaker Friends in an episode of the TV series ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]''. In 2015, the same song, credited as "Singing For Our Lives" appeared in the Australian independent film [[The Lives We Lead]], alongside its theme song "I Am Willing", another rousing Near-penned protest song.

Holly Near was named as an Honoree for National Women's History Month for 2015.&lt;ref name="ukiahdailyjournal.com"/&gt; She continues to perform concerts as well as music festivals and rallies. Near hosted many of the tributes to both Pete Seeger and Ronnie Gilbert, two members of the seminal folk group The Weavers.

Holly has been an honored guest at several of the GALA Gatherings, a conference of GLBTQ choirs and choruses. In her work with the choruses she focuses on diction, drama, and understanding the intention of the lyric. She also appears as a soloist with several of the choruses and many of her songs have been arranged for choral singing.

In 2018, Near released a new recording titled ''2018'', reflecting on issues including the environment, aging, domestic violence and the unresolved storm damage in Puerto Rico as a result of [[Hurricane Maria]]. In October 2018, a documentary film titled ''Holly Near: Singing For Our Lives'' made by award-winning director [[Jim Brown (director)|Jim Brown]] premiered at the [[Mill Valley Film Festival]], detailing Near's life and work.&lt;ref name="Swanson"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bohemian.com/northbay/sing-for-life/Content?oid=7181393 |title=Sing For Life |last=Swanson |first=Charlie |date=October 2, 2018 |website=www.bohemian.com |publisher=Metro Newspapers |access-date=October 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
As a result of her travels in the Pacific with the [[Free The Army tour|FTA show]], Near became a [[feminism|feminist]], linking international [[feminism]] and [[anti-war]] activism. In 1976, Near came out as a lesbian&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"/&gt; and began a three-year relationship with musician [[Meg Christian]]. Near was probably the first out lesbian to be interviewed in ''[[People Magazine]]''. She added [[LGBT]] issues to her international peace work as she continued to present [[social change]] music around the world and at home.  Although Holly was one of the most visible artists in the lesbian community, she was also becoming aware that "[[monogamy|monogamous]]" defined her sexuality more than any other title.

Near has been in a relationship with a man since 1994.  However, she does not identify as bisexual.  When asked why in a 2010 interview by [[JD Doyle]] for ''Queer Music Heritage'', she replied, 

{{quote|I don't know why. Just isn't a handle I relate to. I include human and civil rights in all that I do. I am monogamous. I relate to that term. I am a feminist. If I am with a woman I am a feminist. If I am alone I am a feminist. If I am with a man I am a feminist. And until the one I am with and I part ways, then I am just what I am in that relationship and I don't much think about what I will do next. I focus more on what I bring to that relationship. It is a full-time job being honest one moment at a time, remembering to love, to honor, to respect. It is a practice, a discipline, worthy of every moment. I think my feminism and my ability to love has been highly informed by having had lesbian relationships. The quality of my life has, without question, been elevated.
 
For a brief moment in time I struggled with sexual identity, somewhere in the mid-'80s. Then I realized it was the wrong question for me. That is not to say it is the wrong question for others. It just wasn't important to me. So I haven't really thought much about it since. I am going to sing lesbian love songs and support gay rights no matter what. The rest is public relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollynear.com/art_interviews.html|title=Art &amp; Activism: Interviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

That said, Near is dedicated to the rights of LGBTQ+ communities and continues to work to create a cultural forum for diversity. Near writes, "For many, sexual identity and/or gender identity is the primary door through which they walk.  It is what politicized them. It is what feeds their emotional and spiritual perspectives. I totally honor this. Even though sexual preference is maybe 5th or 10th on my personal list of priorities now, I will always work for all of us to have self determination over our bodies, our identities, our relationship choices."

In 2014, Near was diagnosed with breast cancer. With early detection, she had successful surgery and radiation but did not need to do chemotherapy.

Near spent one year traveling across the US camping out of her car and staying with friends.  She then went to Argentina and Chile to study and write. She currently rents a one bedroom apartment in Sonoma County, Ca. and she spends a lot of time in NYC. She drives a 2003 VW. Near is "auntie" and "grandma" to several young people even though she never had children.

'''''Horror for Good: A Charitable Anthology (Volume 1)''''' is a non-themed [[anthology]] of thirty-two horror short stories, featuring some of the biggest names in the [[horror fiction]] genre, including [[Joe R. Lansdale]], [[Ramsey Campbell]], [[Jack Ketchum]], [[F. Paul Wilson]], [[Ray Garton]] and [[Joe McKinney]].

It was published by [[Cutting Block Press]] in 2012 and 100 percent of the proceeds will go to [[amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research]].

The anthology was co-edited by [[Mark Scioneaux]], [[Robert S. Wilson]] and [[R. J. Cavender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilliand|first=Blu|title='Horror for Good': Anthology Scares Up Support for a Good Cause|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/interview/%E2%80%98horror-good-anthology-scares-support-good-cause|work=FearNet.com|access-date= July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scioneaux, Horror for Good founder, writes in his original introduction that "The heart of the horror community is on full display, and it stretches from the very top with [[Horror Writers Association]] President [[Rocky Wood]], all the way to an author whose first ever published work will appear in these pages. The Horror Community has heart!"&lt;ref name=HFG&gt;{{cite book|last=Scioneaux|first=Mark|title=Horror for Good: A Charitable Anthology|year=2012|publisher= [[Cutting Block Press]] |location=Austin, Texas|isbn=1475065361|page=404|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scioneaux adds, "The authors contained within these pages are a mix of some of the brightest stars and some of the most promising new talent in horror. They have donated their stories, consisting of rare reprints, personal favorites, and brand new, never-before-published tales."&lt;ref name=HFG /&gt;

The anthology premiered at the [[World Horror Convention]] in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]] in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Horror for Good|url=http://www.whc2012.org/horror4good.html| publisher = [[World Horror Convention]] |access-date= July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hunters Palette''' or '''Lion Hunt Palette''' is a circa 3100 BCE [[cosmetic palette]] from the [[Naqada III]] period of late [[prehistoric Egypt]]. The palette is broken: part is held by the British Museum and part is in the collection of the [[Louvre]].

The Hunters Palette shows a complex [[iconography]] of [[lion hunting]] as well as the hunt of other animals such as birds, desert [[hare]]s, and [[gazelle]] types; one gazelle is being contained by a rope. The weapons used in the twenty-man hunt are the [[bow and arrow]], [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]], [[throwing stick]]s, and [[spear]]s. Two icongraphic conjoined bull-forefronts adorn the upper right alongside a hieroglyphic-like symbol similar to the "shrine" hieroglyph, ''sḥ''. &lt;hiero&gt;O21&lt;/hiero&gt;{{commons category|Shrine (hieroglyph)}}

An '''incunable''', or sometimes '''incunabulum''' (plural '''incunables''' or '''incunabula''', respectively), is a [[book]], pamphlet, or [[Broadside (printing)|broadside]] [[printing|printed]] in [[Europe]] before the year 1501. (Importantly, incunabula are not [[manuscript]]s.) {{As of|2014|post=,}} there are about 30,000 distinct known incunable [[Edition (book)|edition]]s extant. The number of surviving copies in [[Germany]] alone is estimated at around 125,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Library]]: [http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html Incunabula Short Title Catalogue] gives 30,375 editions as of March 2014, which also includes some prints from the 16th century though (retrieved 23 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Bettina Wagner: "Das Second-Life der Wiegendrucke. Die Inkunabelsammlung der Bayerischen Staatsbibliothek", in: Griebel, Rolf; Ceynowa, Klaus (eds.): "Information, Innovation, Inspiration. 450 Jahre Bayerische Staatsbibliothek", K G Saur, München 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-598-11772-5}}, pp. 207–224 (207f.) the Incunabula Short Title Catalogue lists 30,375 titles published before 1501.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
"Incunable" is the [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] singular form of ''incunabula'', [[Latin]] for "[[swaddling]] clothes" or "[[bassinet|cradle]]",&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Lewis and C. Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', Oxford 1879, p. 930. The word ''incunabula'' is a neuter plural only; the singular ''incunabulum'' is never found in Latin and not used in English by most specialists.&lt;/ref&gt; which can refer to "the earliest stages or first traces in the development of anything".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1933, I:188.&lt;/ref&gt; A former term for "incunable" is '''"fifteener"''',&lt;!--fifteener redirects here--&gt; referring to the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Introduction to Incunabula | url=http://www.historicpages.com/texts/incun1.htm | publisher=Barber, Phil | accessdate=6 July 2017 | quote="Incunabula" is a generic term coined by English book collectors in the seventeenth century to describe the first printed books of the fifteenth century. It is a more elegant replacement for what had previously been called 'fifteeners', and is formed of two Latin words meaning literally 'in the cradle' or 'in swaddling clothes'. The word is plural; in referring to a single fifteenth century book, "incunabulum" is correct.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Fifteener" is a coinage of the bibliographer [[Thomas Frognall Dibdin]], a term endorsed by [[William Morris]] and [[Robert Proctor (bibliographer)|Robert Proctor]]. {{harv|Carter|Barker|2004|p=130}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''incunabula'' as a printing term was first used by the Dutch physician and humanist [[Hadrianus Junius|Hadrianus Iunius]] (Adriaan de Jonghe, 1511–1575) and appears in a passage from his posthumous work (written in 1569): Hadrianus Iunius, ''Batavia'', [...], [Lugduni Batavorum], ex officina Plantiniana, apud Franciscum Raphelengium, '''1588''', p. 256 l. 3: «inter prima artis [typographicae] '''incunabula'''», a term ("the first infancy of printing") to which he arbitrarily set an end of 1500 which still stands as a convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glomski|first1=J|title=Incunabula Typographiae: seventeenth-century views on early printing|journal=The Library|volume=2|pages=336|year=2001|doi=10.1093/library/2.4.336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only by a misunderstanding was [[Bernhard von Mallinckrodt]] (1591–1664) considered to be the inventor of this meaning of ''incunabula''; the identical passage is found in his Latin pamphlet ''De ortu ac progressu artis typographicae'' ("On the rise and progress of the typographic art", [[Cologne]], 1640): Bernardus a Mallinkrot, ''De ortu ac progressu artis typographicae dissertatio historica'', [...], Coloniae Agrippinae, apud Ioannem Kinchium, '''1640''' (in frontispiece: 1639), p. 29 l. 16: «inter prima artis [typographicae] '''incunabula'''», within a long passage of several pages, which he (correctly) quotes entirely in italic characters (that is between quotation marks), referring to the name of author and work cited: «Primus istorum [...] Hadrianus Iunius est, cuius integrum locum, ex ''Batavia'' eius, operae pretium est adscribere; [...]. Ita igitur Iunius» (ibid., p. 27 ll. 27-32, followed by the long passage, «Redeo → sordes», ibid., p. 27, l. 32 – p. 33 l. 32 [= ''Batavia'', p. 253 l. 28 – p. 258 l. 21]). So the source is only one, the other is a quotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Le baptême inconscient de l'incunable: non pas 1640 mais 1569 au plus tard|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00791398v2|journal=Gutenberg Jahrbuch|volume=84|pages=102–105|language=French|doi=|last1=Sordet|first1=Yann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''incunabula'' came to denote the printed books themselves in the late 17th century. [[John Evelyn]], in moving the [[Arundel Manuscripts]] to the [[Royal Society]] in August 1678, remarked of the printed books among the manuscripts: "The printed books, being of the oldest impressions, are not the less valuable; I esteem them almost equal to MSS."&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn, ''The Diary of John Evelyn From 1641 to 1705/6''.&lt;/ref&gt; The convenient but arbitrarily chosen end date for identifying a printed book as an incunable does not reflect any notable developments in the printing process, and many books printed for a number of years after 1500 continued to be visually indistinguishable from incunables.  

'''"Post-incunable"''' typically refers to books printed after 1500 up to another arbitrary end date such as 1520 or 1540. From around this period the dating of any edition becomes easier, as the practice of printers including information such as the place and year of printing became more widespread.

==Types==
There are two types of ''incunabula'' in printing: the [[block book]], printed from a single carved or sculpted wooden block for each page, employing the same process as the [[woodcut]] in art (these may be called ''xylographic''); and the ''[[Typography|typographic book]]'', made with individual pieces of cast-metal [[movable type]] on a [[printing press]]. Many authors reserve the term ''incunabula'' for the latter kind only.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Companion to the Book'', ed. M. F. Suarez and H. R. Woudhuysen, OUP, 2010, s.v. 'Incunabulum', p. 815.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of [[printing]] to cities both in the north and in Italy ensured that there was great variety in the texts chosen for printing and the styles in which they appeared. Many early [[typeface]]s were modelled on local forms of [[writing]] or derived from the various European forms of [[Blackletter|Gothic]] script, but there were also some derived from documentary scripts (such as most of [[William Caxton|Caxton]]'s types), and, particularly in Italy, types modelled on handwritten scripts and [[calligraphy]] employed by [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]].

Printers congregated in urban centres where there were [[scholar]]s, [[ecclesiastic]]s, [[lawyers]], and [[nobles]] and [[profession]]als who formed their major customer base. Standard works in [[Latin]] inherited from the medieval tradition formed the bulk of the earliest printed works, but as books became cheaper, [[vernacular]] works (or translations into vernaculars of standard works) began to appear.

The most famous ''incunabula'' include two from [[Mainz]], the [[Gutenberg Bible]] of 1455 and the ''[[Peregrinatio in terram sanctam]]'' of 1486, printed and illustrated by [[Erhard Reuwich]]; the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' written by [[Hartmann Schedel]] and printed by [[Anton Koberger]] in 1493; and the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'' printed by [[Aldus Manutius]] with important illustrations by an unknown artist. 

Other printers of incunabula were [[Günther Zainer]] of [[Augsburg]], [[Johannes Mentelin]] and [[Heinrich Eggestein]] of [[Strasbourg]], [[Heinrich Gran]] of [[Haguenau]] and [[William Caxton]] of [[Bruges]] and [[London]]. The first incunable to have woodcut illustrations was [[Ulrich Boner]]'s ''Der Edelstein'', printed by [[Albrecht Pfister]] in [[Bamberg]] in 1461.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel De Simone (ed), ''A Heavenly Craft: the Woodcut in Early Printed Books,'' New York, 2004, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-incunable ==
Many incunabula are undated, needing complex bibliographical analysis to place them correctly. The post-incunabula period marks a time of development during which the printed book evolved fully as a mature artefact with a standard format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |title=The Book Triumphant: Print in Transition in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries |editor1-last=Walsby |editor1-first=Malcolm |editor2-last=Kemp |editor2-first=Graeme |publisher=Brill |year=2011 |page=viii |isbn=9789004207233 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cysqnfvAUEAC&amp;pg=PR7}}&lt;/ref&gt; After c. 1540 books tended to conform to a template that included the author, title-page, date, seller, and place of printing. This makes it much easier to identify any particular edition.{{sfn|Walsby|Kemp|2011|p=viii}}

As noted above, the ''end date'' for identifying a printed book as an incunable is convenient but was chosen arbitrarily; it does not reflect any notable developments in the printing process around the year 1500. Books printed for a number of years after 1500 continued to look much like incunables, with the notable exception of the small format books printed in [[italic type]] introduced by [[Aldus Manutius]] in 1501. The term '''post-incunable''' is sometimes used to refer to books printed "after 1500—how long after, the experts have not yet agreed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv| |first=John |last=Carter |first2=Nicolas |last2=Barker |title=ABC for Book Collectors |url=http://www.ilab.org/download.php?object=documentation&amp;id=29 |format=PDF |accessdate=28 May 2010 |edition=8th |year=2004 |publisher=Oak Knoll Press and the British Library |location=New Castle, Del. |isbn=1-58456-112-2 |page=172}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; For books printed in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the term generally covers 1501–1520, and for books printed in mainland [[Europe]], 1501–1540.{{sfn|Carter|Barker|2004|p=172}}

The data in this section were derived from the [[Incunabula Short-Title Catalogue]] (ISTC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html BL.uk], consulted in 2007. The figures are subject to slight change as new copies are reported. Exact figures are given but should be treated as close estimates; they refer to extant editions.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of printing towns and cities stands at 282. These are situated in some 18 countries in terms of present-day boundaries. In descending order of the number of editions printed in each, these are: [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]], [[Spain]], [[Belgium]], [[England]], [[Austria]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Portugal]], [[Poland]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Turkey]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], and [[Hungary]] (see diagram). 

The following table shows the 20 main 15th century printing locations; as with all data in this section, exact figures are given, but should be treated as close estimates (the total editions recorded in ISTC at May 2013 is 28,395):

The 18 languages that incunabula are printed in, in descending order, are: Latin, [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], English, [[Hebrew]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Church Slavonic]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Frisian languages|Frisian]] and [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] (see diagram).

Only about one edition in ten (i.e. just over 3,000) has any illustrations, [[woodcut]]s or [[metalcut]]s.

The "commonest" incunable is Schedel's ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' ("Liber Chronicarum") of 1493, with c 1,250 surviving copies (which is also the most heavily illustrated). Many incunabula are unique, but on average about 18 copies survive of each. This makes the [[Gutenberg Bible]], at 48 or 49 known copies, a relatively common (though extremely valuable) edition. Counting extant incunabula is complicated by the fact that most libraries consider a single volume of a multi-volume work as a separate item, as well as fragments or copies lacking more than half the total leaves. A complete incunable may consist of a slip, or up to ten volumes.

In terms of [[Book size|format]], the 29,000-odd editions comprise: 2,000 [[broadside (printing)|broadsides]], 9,000 [[Folio (printing)|folios]], 15,000 [[quarto]]s, 3,000 [[octavo]]s, 18 [[Book size|12mos]], 230 [[Book size|16mos]], 20 [[Book size|32mos]], and 3 [[Book size|64mos]].

ISTC at present cites 528 extant copies of books printed by [[William Caxton|Caxton]], which together with 128 fragments makes 656 in total, though many are broadsides or very imperfect (incomplete).

Apart from migration to mainly North American and Japanese universities, there has been little movement of incunabula in the last five centuries. None were printed in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and the latter appears to possess less than 2,000 copies, about 97.75% remain north of the equator. However many incunabula are sold at auction or through the rare book trade every year.

==Major collections==
The [[British Library]]'s [[Incunabula Short Title Catalogue]] now records over 29,000 titles, of which around 27,400 are incunabula editions (not all unique works). Studies of incunabula began in the 17th century. [[Michel Maittaire]] (1667–1747) and [[Georg Wolfgang Panzer]] (1729–1805) arranged printed material chronologically in annals format, and in the first half of the 19th century, [[Ludwig Hain]] published, ''Repertorium bibliographicum''— a checklist of incunabula arranged alphabetically by author: "Hain numbers" are still a reference point. Hain was expanded in subsequent editions, by [[Walter A. Copinger]] and [[Dietrich Reichling]], but it is being superseded by the authoritative modern listing, a German catalogue, the ''[[Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke]]'', which has been under way since 1925 and is still being compiled at the [[Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin]]. North American holdings were listed by [[Frederick R. Goff]] and a worldwide union catalogue is provided by the [[Incunabula Short Title Catalogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/|title=ISTC|accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable collections, with the approximate numbers of incunabula held, include:

'''Ink wash painting''', also known as '''literati painting''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|ɪ|t|ə|ˈ|r|ɑː|t|i}}), is an [[East Asia]]n type of [[ink brush|brush]] [[painting]] of Chinese origin that uses black ink—the same as used in [[East Asian calligraphy]]—in various concentrations. For centuries, this form of [[Chinese art]] was practiced by highly educated [[scholar gentlemen]] or [[intellectual|literati]].

Names used in the cultures concerned include: in Chinese '''''shuimohua''''' (水墨畫), in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] '''''sumi-e''''' (墨絵) or {{nihongo|'''''suibokuga'''''|水墨画}}, Vietnamese: Tranh thuỷ mặc, and in [[Korean language|Korean]]  '''''sumukhwa''''' (수묵화)

==History==
{{Main|Chinese painting}}

Textual evidence suggests that [[Shan shui]] style painting existed during [[China]]'s [[Liu Song dynasty]] of the fifth century. Ink wash painting developed further during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907). The 8th-century poet/painter [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] is generally credited as the painter who applied color to existing ink wash paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Yushu Wang. Wu Zhou Chuan bo chu ban she.  Translated by 王玉书. [2005] (2005). Selected poems and pictures of the Tang dynasty 五洲传播出版社 {{ISBN|7-5085-0798-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The art was further developed into a more polished style during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279).  It was introduced to Korea shortly after China's discovery of ink. In Japan, ink was introduced during the Nara period where it soon became popular among the upper class. At first, the Japanese only used it for calligraphy, but eventually, they started painting with ink.

==Philosophy==
[[File:Landscape by Sesshu (Ohara).jpg|thumb|upright|Mountain landscapes are by far the most common scenes depicted in ink wash [[landscape painting]]s. Pictured: ''[[Landscape by Sesshū]]'']]

East Asian aesthetic writing is generally consistent in stating the goal of ink and wash painting is not simply to reproduce the appearance of the subject, but to capture its spirit. To paint a horse, the ink wash painting artist must understand its temperament better than its muscles and bones. To paint a flower, there is no need to perfectly match its petals and colors, but it is essential to convey its liveliness and fragrance. East Asian ink wash painting may be regarded as a form of expressionistic art that captures the unseen.

In [[landscape painting]] the scenes depicted are typically imaginary, or very loose adaptations of actual views.  Mountain landscapes are by far the most common, often evoking particular areas traditionally famous for their beauty, from which the artist may have been very distant.  Water is very often included.

East Asian ink wash painting has long inspired modern artists in the West. In his classic book ''Composition'', American artist and educator [[Arthur Wesley Dow]] (1857–1922) wrote this about ink wash painting: "The painter&amp;nbsp;... put upon the paper the fewest possible lines and tones; just enough to cause form, texture and effect to be felt. Every brush-touch must be full-charged with meaning, and useless detail eliminated. Put together all the good points in such a method, and you have the qualities of the highest art".&lt;ref name="composition"&gt;{{cite book |last= Dow |first= Arthur Wesley |title= Composition |year= 1899}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dow's fascination with ink wash painting not only shaped his own approach to art but also helped free many American modernists of the era, including his student [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], from what he called a "story-telling" approach. Dow strived for harmonic compositions through three elements: line, shading, and color. He advocated practicing with East Asian brushes and ink to develop aesthetic acuity with line and shading.

During the Ming dynasty, Chinese painters Dong Qichang (J: Tō Kishō, 1555-1636), Mo Shilong (1537?–1587), and Chen Jiru (1558–1639) identified two different schools: the "Northern School of Painting" (Beizonghua or Beihua J: Hokushūga), and the "Southern School of Painting" (Nanzonghua or Nanhua J: Nanshuga), also called "Literati Painting" (Wenrenhua J: Bunjinga).&lt;ref&gt;Marco, Meccarelli. 2015.

==Technique==
Ink wash painting uses tonality and shading achieved by varying the ink density, both by differential grinding of the ink stick in water and by varying the ink load and pressure within a single brushstroke. Ink wash painting artists spend years practicing basic brush strokes to refine their brush movement and ink flow. In the hand of a master, a single stroke can produce astonishing variations in tonality, from deep black to silvery gray. Thus, in its original context, shading means more than just dark-light arrangement: It is the basis for the beautiful nuance in tonality found in East Asian ink wash painting and brush-and-ink calligraphy.

Ink wash painting is usually done on xuan paper (Chinese) or washi (Japanese paper) both of which are  highly absorbent and [[Sizing|unsized]].  Silk is also used in some forms of ink painting.  Many types of xuan paper and washi do not lend themselves readily to a smooth wash the way watercolor paper does.  Each brush stroke is visible, so any "wash" in the sense of Western style painting requires partially sized paper.  Paper manufacturers today understand artists' demands for more versatile papers and work to produce kinds that are more flexible.  If one uses traditional paper, the idea of an "ink wash" refers to a wet-on-wet technique, applying black ink to paper where a lighter ink has already been applied, or by quickly manipulating watery diluted ink once it has been applied to the paper by using a very large brush.

In ink wash paintings, as in calligraphy, artists usually grind [[inkstick]] over an [[inkstone]] to obtain black [[ink]], but prepared liquid inks (墨汁 in Japanese, ''bokuju'') are also available. Most inksticks are made of [[soot]] from [[pine]] or [[vegetable fats and oils|oil]] combined with [[animal glue]]. An artist puts a few drops of water on an inkstone and grinds the inkstick in a circular motion until a smooth, black ink of the desired concentration is made. Prepared liquid inks vary in viscosity, solubility, concentration, etc., but are in general more suitable for practicing [[Chinese calligraphy]] than executing paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Okamoto, Naomi ''The Art of Sumi-e: Beautiful ink painting using Japanese Brushwork'', Search Press, Kent UK, 2015, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Inksticks themselves are sometimes ornately decorated with [[Landscape art|landscapes]] or flowers in [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|bas-relief]] and some are highlighted with gold.

Ink wash painting [[Ink brush|brushes]] are similar to the brushes used for calligraphy and are traditionally made from [[bamboo]] with [[goat#Fiber|goat]], [[cattle]], [[horsehair|horse]], [[Wool|sheep]], [[rabbit]], [[Japanese marten|marten]], [[European badger|badger]], [[sika deer|deer]], [[wild boar|boar]] and [[gray wolf|wolf]] hair. The brush hairs are tapered to a fine point, a feature vital to the style of wash paintings.

Different brushes have different qualities. A small wolf-hair brush that is tapered to a fine point can deliver an even thin line of ink (much like a pen). A large wool brush (one variation called the ''big cloud'') can hold a large volume of water and ink. When the big cloud brush rains down upon the paper, it delivers a graded swath of ink encompassing myriad shades of gray to black.

Once a stroke is painted, it cannot be changed or erased.  This makes ink and wash painting a technically demanding art-form requiring great skill, concentration, and years of training.

'''Ion Theodorescu-Sion''' ({{IPA-ro|iˈon te.odoˈresku siˈon}}; also known as '''Ioan Theodorescu-Sion''' or '''Teodorescu-Sion'''; January 2, 1882 – March 31, 1939) was a [[Romania]]n painter and draftsman, known for his contributions to [[modern art]] and especially for his traditionalist, [[Primitivism|primitivist]], [[handicraft]]-inspired and [[Christian art|Christian painting]]. Trained in [[academic art]], initially an [[Impressionism|Impressionist]], he dabbled in various modern styles in the years before [[World War I]]. Theodorescu-Sion's palette was interchangeably [[Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]], [[Divisionism|Divisionist]], [[Realist visual arts|Realist]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]], [[Synthetism|Synthetist]], [[Fauvism|Fauve]] or [[Cubism|Cubist]], but his creation had one major ideological focus: depicting peasant life in its natural setting. In time, Sion contributed to the generational goal of creating a specifically Romanian modern art, located at the intersection of folk tradition, primitivist tendencies borrowed from the West, and 20th-century [[Agrarianism|agrarian politics]].

Initially scandalized by Theodorescu-Sion's experiments, public opinion accepted his tamer style of the mid to late 1910s. Sion was commissioned as a war artist, after which his standing increased. His paintings alternated the monumental depictions of harsh rural environments, and their inhabitants, with luminous [[Balchik|Balcic]] seascapes and nostalgic records of suburban life. Their search for visual concreteness was a standard for the anti-Impressionist emancipation of the [[Art of Romania|Romanian artistic scene]] in the [[interwar period]].

By the mid-1920s, Sion's style became a visual component of the neo-traditionalist, "Romanianist" and [[neo-Byzantine]] current formed around ''[[Gândirea]]'' literary magazine. In the years before his death, the emergent [[avant-garde]] was voicing criticism of his new stylistic and ideological choices. Sion's oscillation between modernity and parochialism, his flirtation with [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] politics, and the eventual decline of his work endure as topics of controversy.

==Biography==

===Background and early life===
The son of a [[Căile Ferate Române|Romanian Railways]] [[brakeman]] and the peasant-woman Ioana Ursu,&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.138, 149&lt;/ref&gt; Theodorescu-Sion was born in [[Ianca]], [[Brăila County]],&lt;ref name="smmedalion"&gt;{{ro icon}} Simona Mocanu, [http://www.braila.djc.ro/DocumenteHtml.aspx?ID=2800 ''Medalion Ion Theodorescu - Sion. 70 ani de la trecerea în neființă''], at the [[Brăila County]]'s [http://www.braila.djc.ro/ Directorate for Culture and National Patrimony Sites]; retrieved November 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and baptized into the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name="pict&amp;zugr164"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/vestitorul/1937/BCUCLUJ_FP_279921_1937_013_017_018.pdf "Pictori și zugravi bisericești autorizați"], in ''Vestitorul'', Nr. 17-18/1937, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; On both sides, his family had origins in [[Transylvania]]'s [[Apuseni Mountains]] and the [[Breadfield]], regions at the time still part of [[Austria-Hungary]]; by popular account, some were ''[[Țara Moților|Moți]]'', that is to say [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] herders with a distinctly rustic lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.122-123, 138-139, 149. See also Crainic, p.287; Tăslăuanu, p.248&lt;/ref&gt; Ion spent his early childhood on the [[Bărăgan Plain]], but grew up into a passionate hiker of the [[Carpathian Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.138; Pavel, p.211&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, having attended primary and secondary school in the [[Danube]] port of [[Brăila]], the boy left for [[Bucharest]] to study at the [[Bucharest National University of Arts|National School of Fine Arts]], and graduated in 1897.&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt; From 1904 to 1907, with a [[Ministry of National Defense (Romania)|Ministry of War]] scholarship to his name,&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.telegrafonline.ro/1173477600/articol/22533/compozitii_ale_pictorului_ion_theodorescusion_in_colectiile_muzeului_de_arta.html "Compoziții ale pictorului Ion Theodorescu-Sion, în colecțiile Muzeului de Artă"], in ''[[Telegraf - Constanța]]'', March 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; he traveled to [[France]]. Sion consequently enlisted at the ''[[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]]'', studying under academic masters [[Jean-Paul Laurens]] and [[Luc-Olivier Merson]].&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt; He was a rebellious student, shaped by [[Socialism|socialist]] ideas, and squandered his scholarship money.&lt;ref name="Vlasiu 2010, p.9"&gt;Vlasiu (2010), p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

Sion was rendered enthusiastic by news of the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|Revolution in Russia]], and was thrown out by his conservative patrons.&lt;ref name="Vlasiu 2010, p.9"/&gt; He burned all his belongings except a copy of ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'', and traveled to [[French Algeria]], where he probably intended to apply for the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]].&lt;ref name="Vlasiu 2010, p.9"/&gt; He later returned to Romania, but frequently traveled out of Romania on study trips. These took him to the [[Low Countries]], [[England]] and [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt; He was a staff [[cartoon]]ist (caricaturist) for various Romanian satirical papers, including ''Zavera'' ("The Trouble"), ''Nea Ghiță'' ("Uncle Ghiță") and [[George Ranetti]]'s ''[[Furnica (magazine)|Furnica]]''.&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt;

From his French period, Theodorescu-Sion brought home the echoes of Impressionism, and the more modern influences of [[Paul Cézanne]], the post-Impressionist, and [[André Derain]], the Fauve, together with the optical theories of Divisionism.&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kzzambacu"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Krikor Zambaccian]], [http://destinatii.liternet.ro/articol/116/Krikor-H-Zambaccian/Zambacu.html "Zambacu"], [[Editura LiterNet]]; retrieved November 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1908 and 1915, the artist, still heavily indebted to the work of [[Henri Fantin-Latour]],&lt;ref name="mvsociete63-64"&gt;{{fr icon}} Mariana Vida, [http://www.istoria-artei.ro/resources/files/RRHA_2007.pdf "La société ''Tinerimea artistică'' de Bucarest et le symbolisme tardif entre 1902-1910"], in ''Revue Roumaine d'Histoire de l'Art. Série Beaux-arts'', Vol. XLIV, 2007, p.63-64&lt;/ref&gt; was focused on creating Symbolist compositions with trees.&lt;ref name="ap92-93"&gt;Pavel, p.92-93&lt;/ref&gt; As he took more risks in his experimentation, he began looking to Cubist [[Georges Braque]] for a new way of arranging [[still life]]s.&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kzzambacu"/&gt; In tandem with such contributions were Realistic works suggesting the influence of Romania's [[Camil Ressu]].&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kzzambacu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adb(31)316"&gt;Broșteanu (1931), p.316&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolist movement and Balcic colony===
Sion was received into the innovative and eclectic society ''[[Tinerimea Artistică]]'', as one of its Symbolist recruits, in 1909, and shortly after exhibited his religious-themed portrait ''Lux in tenebris lucet'' ({{bibleverse|John|1:5|NIV}}).&lt;ref name="mvsociete63-64"/&gt; The same year, he sent his works to the Official Bucharest Salon, and shared with others the jury's Second Prize ''[[ex aequo]]''.&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Veronica Marinescu, [http://www.curierulnational.ro/Specializat/2010-12-01/Licitatie+Brancusi,+la+Paris "Licitație Brâncuși, la Paris"], in ''[[Curierul Național]]'', December 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In tandem, he began hiking through the Carpathian and rural regions of Transylvania. His paintings record a growing interest in lives of its peasant inhabitants (and thus in his own peasant roots), with focus on the Romanian-inhabited areas of Apuseni, Breadfield or [[Mărginimea Sibiului]].&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.122-123, 138. See also Tăslăuanu, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Culturally, Theodorescu-Sion also affiliated with a new wave of Romanian artists, who used simple forms, bold colors and clear contours to illustrate mystically-charged subjects. Alongside Sion, this group has been said to include [[Cecilia Cuțescu-Storck]], [[Friedrich Storck]]&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.45-47&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Iosif Iser]], followed later by [[Rodica Maniu]] and [[Francisc Șirato]].&lt;ref name="gc823"&gt;Călinescu, p.823&lt;/ref&gt; Literary historian [[George Călinescu]] describes this moment as having generated "calligraphic painting": "shaped by the contours and by the invention of ceremonial attitudes", and "most often stripped down to the drawing."&lt;ref name="gc823"/&gt;

The primitivists' activity in the visual realm is linked to the emergence of unconventional writers and the more radical manifestations of [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolist culture]]—commentators note their kinship with poet [[Adrian Maniu]] (Rodica Maniu's brother)&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.822-823&lt;/ref&gt; or with the minor Symbolists [[Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești]], [[N. D. Cocea]] and [[Theodor Cornel]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.39, 45-46&lt;/ref&gt; Theodorescu-Sion's first moment in the spotlight was in 1910, at the ''Tinerimea Artistică'' collective art show, which shocked the public and the academic authors.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.45-46; Gogîltan, p.122, 142&lt;/ref&gt; The group, joined by sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]], found itself marginalized inside the exhibit, but received support in the Symbolist press.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.46-47&lt;/ref&gt; Building on the conclusions of other researchers, such as [[Theodor Enescu]], literary historian [[Paul Cernat]] sees in this movement, called "anti-academic post-impressionism", Romania's first departure from [[picturesque]] salon art, as well as a Romanian version of the [[Armory Show]] phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

Sion was still regularly present at later ''Tinerimea'' salons. In 1912, he was extremely radical, allowing critics of the day to regard him as the prototype Romanian "[[Futurism|Futurist]]" (an expression of shocking newness, rather than an actual affiliation with the Futurist current).&lt;ref&gt;Vlasiu (2010), p.7-9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, his featured paintings included a rendition of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|the Crucifixion]] and melancholic depictions of solitary shepherds.&lt;ref&gt;Duma, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, he had a personal exhibit (his first-ever)&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt; at the [[Romanian Atheneum]]. As noted by journalist [[Octavian Tăslăuanu]], the establishment still viewed his works with embarrassment, and "exiled" them into a lateral hall.&lt;ref name="oct248"&gt;Tăslăuanu, p.248&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the [[Second Balkan War]] of 1913, a Romanian administration took over in [[Southern Dobruja]], and the region became of interest to Romanian artists. [[Balchik|Balcic]] (''Balchik''), once a promising port of export, declined economically, but its vistas and its exotic [[Islam in Romania|Muslim]] inhabitants made it a popular summertime resort and artists' colony.&lt;ref name="ivtonitza"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ioana Vlasiu, [http://www.romlit.ro/tonitza_i_ntmplrile_artei_romneti2 "Tonitza și întâmplările artei românești"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 18/2002&lt;/ref&gt; Theodorescu-Sion joined this phenomenon at its earliest stage, and was, with Ressu, Iser, Cuțescu-Storck and others, a "founding member" of the Balcic painters' community.&lt;ref name="ivtonitza"/&gt; He was also involved on the art scene of [[Northern Dobruja]], commissioned to decorate the [[Constanța]] City Hall palace with a series of [[mural]]s.&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt; It was here that he first met art collector and mecena [[Krikor Zambaccian]],&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kzzambacu"/&gt; who would purchase an exhibit a sizable portion of his later canvasses, including ''Moara din Balcic'' ("The Balchik Mill").&lt;ref&gt;Broșteanu (1931), p.313, 316&lt;/ref&gt; Zambaccian remembered Sion as a talented but peculiar and vindictive artist, who posed as artistic mentor but could not stand actual competition.&lt;ref name="kzzambacu"/&gt;

===War artist and ''Arta Română'' shows===
Around 1914, Sion had distanced entirely himself from Symbolism and the decorative lines of [[Art Nouveau]], advising his young pupil [[Lola Schmierer Roth]] to do the same—they both relied on a proto-Cubist composition into solid shapes, for which the model was Cézanne.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Mariana Vida, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Intre-tensiunile-expresionismului-si-noul-umanism*articleID_14558-articles_details.html "Între tensiunile expresionismului și noul umanism"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 300-301, December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Co-opted as a teacher at the National School of Fine Arts, Theodorescu-Sion was also one of the founding members of the Artists' Society, a leading Romanian professional association.&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt;

As Romania entered [[World War I]] in 1916, Ion Theodorescu-Sion was forced to interrupt his work on the Constanța murals.&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt; Once drafted into the [[Romanian Land Forces]], he returned to official and academic art: he was employed by [[Chief of the Romanian General Staff|Chief of Staff]] [[Dumitru Iliescu-Turtucaia|Dumitru Iliescu]] to depict the [[Romanian Armed Forces]] in action.&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt; Sion witnessed (and painted) the subsequent [[Romania in World War I|storming of the Romanian front]] by the [[Central Powers]], and joined the exodus of Romanian soldiers and civil authorities into the eastern region of [[Moldavia]]. He was in [[Iași]], the provisional capital, where he began collaborating with other war artists driven away by the defeats.&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt; In 1918, Sion joined them as they broke with ''Tinerimea'', creating the new artistic forum ''Arta Română'' ("Romanian Art")—Ressu, [[Nicolae Tonitza]], [[Ștefan Dimitrescu]] and [[Oscar Han]] were among the other main affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.143&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Gândirea'' years===
The 1920s were a new period of synthesis in Theodorescu-Sion's life, as he became the artistic exponent of a neo-traditionalist movement centered on ''[[Gândirea]]'' magazine. Welcomed there by art columnist [[Oscar Walter Cisek]],&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.101; Grigorescu, p.434-435, 445&lt;/ref&gt; and later by editor in chief [[Nichifor Crainic]],&lt;ref&gt;Crainic, 286-287&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nsepistol"&gt;{{ro icon}} Nicolae Scurtu, [http://www.romlit.ro/noi_contributii_despre_epistolograful_pamfil_seicaru "Noi contribuții despre epistolograful Pamfil Șeicaru"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 16/2010&lt;/ref&gt; he provided illustrations to 1923's ''Satul meu'' ("My Village"), by ''Gândirist'' poet laureate [[Ion Pillat]].&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt; Another former Symbolist, [[Tudor Arghezi]], welcomed the change in style, writing: "Whosoever remembers Theodorescu-Sion's angles, points, squares, circles, semicircles and spheres will have thanked him for handing in his cap and taking on a better suited hat, and for parting with the confabulations of a very reduced Symbolism".&lt;ref name="Vlasiu 2010, p.9"/&gt; The painter still took commissions from the Symbolist movement, providing illustration to a Symbolist play by [[Ion Minulescu]], in ''Cetiți-mă!'' monthly (January 1922).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Anca Andreescu, [http://www.bjastrasibiu.ro/conferinte/139-Anca%20Andreescu.pdf ''Conferințele Bibliotecii ASTRA, Nr. 139. Între jurnalistică și literatură''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508030020/http://www.bjastrasibiu.ro/conferinte/139-Anca%20Andreescu.pdf |date=2014-05-08 }}, [[Asociația Transilvană pentru Literatura Română și Cultura Poporului Român|ASTRA]], Sibiu, 2011, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

The painter looked favorably to ''Gândirea''{{'}}s quest for a new national specificity in art, or "Romanianism". The authors of a 1970 retrospective, published with [[Editura Meridiane]], describe the period as follows: "From very different perspectives, the magazines ''[[Viața Românească]]'' and ''Gândirea'' [...] militated for the creation of artworks inspired from the Romanian reality; and if, at a later date, ''Gândirism'' would bear the imprint of exacerbated nationalism, as one of the carriers for the [[far right]] ideology, it is no less true that, in its beginnings, the magazine defined its aesthetic credo by balancing it against art's necessity of expressing a national reality."&lt;ref&gt;Drăguț ''et al.'', p.241-242&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with author [[Felix Aderca]], Sion claimed: "The artistic feeling of Romanianism is separated from those of other peoples by a special sensitivity. Discretion applied to delicacy, harmony in a subdued chromatic. All things in union, calm and clear like a midsummer's afternoon."&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kzzambacu"/&gt; Gogîltan links Theodorescu-Sion's main period with the establishment of [[Greater Romania]]: "Ion Theodorescu-Sion 'national-themed' canvasses were the visual rendition of a United Kingdom of Romania geography, following its incorporation of Transylvania, [[Banat]], [[Crișana]] and [[Bukovina]] in the year 1918."&lt;ref name="ag101"&gt;Gogîltan, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; She believes that Sion's passion for depicting shepherds on their seasonal treks, or [[transhumance]], is a symbol for Greater Romania as people meeting over [[pasture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.127&lt;/ref&gt;

Re-adapting himself to what critic [[Tudor Vianu]] calls "the mountaineer's experience", Sion was resuming his travels deep into the mountains, in both Argeș County and areas of Transylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Pavel, p.94, 211&lt;/ref&gt; Of all the paintings he presented for the public during the Ileana Gallery Art Show in 1925, the vast majority were landscapes of the mountains, or compositions with shepherds and mountain-folk such as ''La isvorul Troiței'' ("At the Troița [Trinity] Spring"), alternating with new Balcic seascapes.&lt;ref&gt;Cisek, "Ioan Theodorescu-Sion", ''passim''; Pavel, p.211-215&lt;/ref&gt; There is the occasional still life: ''Roz și roș'' ("Pink and Red"), which probably alluded to a poem by Transylvanian author [[Octavian Goga]], impressed Goga and was bought for the state by [[Ion Lapedatu]].&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; Sion returned to the same venue in early 1926, when his exhibited a diverse selection of his newer compositions,&lt;ref&gt;Cisek (1926), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; and was rewarded with a higher class Order of the Crown.&lt;ref name="sapitorescii"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Sorin Alexandrescu]], [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=8944 "Bucureștiul pitoresc (II)"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', August 19, 2005 (republished by the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]]'s [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ ''România Culturală''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021335/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ |date=2011-09-02 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

A noted figure on Bucharest's [[Bohemianism|bohemian scene]], the painter frequented the artistic-literary club at [[Casa Capșa]] restaurant. He sat at the same table with some of the modernist and neo-traditionalist writers ([[Camil Baltazar]], [[Liviu Rebreanu]], [[Vasile Voiculescu]], [[Ilarie Voronca]]), and, story goes, was once caught up in a cake fight with the satirist and prankster [[Păstorel Teodoreanu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Daniela Cârlea Șontică, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/jurnalul-national/la-un-svart-cu-capsistii-print-13785.htm "La un șvarț cu capșiștii"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', August 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Sion satisfied public expectations with portraits of the Bucharest [[upper middle class]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Sorin Alexandrescu]], [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=8939 "Bucureștiul pitoresc (IV)"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', September 2, 2005 (republished by the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]]'s [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ ''România Culturală''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021335/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ |date=2011-09-02 }})&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed a design for the [[Vasile Alecsandri Mausoleum]]. He lost the latter commission to [[Paul Molda]]—reportedly, Sion preserved a bitter grudge against the [[Romanian Academy]], who had ruled against him in this matter.&lt;ref name="nc287"&gt;Crainic, p.287&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final decade===
Around 1927, Theodorescu-Sion was again concentrating on his murals: his only works at the Official Salon for that year were studies for a wall painting called ''Șipotul'' ("Gushing Spring").&lt;ref name="pcvr443-444, 446"&gt;[[Petru Comarnescu]], "Cronica artistică. Sensibilitatea artistică românească", in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 6-7/1927, p.443-444, 446&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Constanța in 1928, he helped organize an official art show to mark the semicentennial of Romanian rule over that region.&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sapitorescii"/&gt; His own paintings were selected to represent Romanian art at [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition|Expo 1929]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], and was part of the 1930 international exhibits in [[The Hague]] and [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt;

By then, he had turned his back on the portrait genre, including on his trademark canvasses of peasants and shepherds, and his art became semi-abstract.&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.127, 128&lt;/ref&gt; He was seen in modernist circles, and contributed to the 1934 exhibit ''Peisajul bucureștean'' ("The Landscape of Bucharest"), with paintings dating back to 1919.&lt;ref name="sapitorescii"/&gt; A year later, he had a retrospective show at Dalles, which ran parallel to the debut exhibit of [[Alexandru Ciucurencu]]. Zambaccian recalls that Sion felt jealousy toward Ciucurencu's fast rise. According to Zambaccian's own account: "And since I was more preoccupied with Ciucurencu than Theodorescu Sion, he got upset and put up a sign on the door of his exhibit: 'No Entry for Dogs and Zambaccian'. Of course the storm soon subsided. The painter's wife tore off the card, and Theodorescu Sion kissed me when we met again!"&lt;ref name="kzzambacu"/&gt;

During the final five years of his life, Sion was becoming a sympathizer of [[King of Romania|Romania's King]], the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]; with [[Olga Greceanu]] and [[Marius Bunescu]], he represented, under Carol's rule, the officially-supported version of modern painting.&lt;ref name="ekmam"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Erwin Kessler]], [http://www.revista22.ro/bucurestiul-cultural-nr-1-2006-2381.html "MAM"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 828, January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; His work was again featured at a world's fair, the 1937 ''[[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]]'' in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt; The same year, he was one of the artists involved in decorating the [[National Museum of Art of Romania|Bucharest Royal Palace (National Museum of Art)]],&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt; and was registered as a state-approved church muralist by government ordinance.&lt;ref name="pict&amp;zugr164"/&gt;

Theodorescu-Sion died in Bucharest, on March 31, 1939,&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt; and was buried in a [[Bellu cemetery]] crypt.&lt;ref name="apmnir"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.monumenteromania.ro/index.php/monumente/detalii/ro/Monumentul%20funerar%20al%20pictorului%20Theodorescu%20Sion/2606/2447 ''Monumentul funerar al pictorului Theodorescu Sion''], at the [http://www.apmnir.ro/en/index.html Friends of the National Museum of History Association]; retrieved November 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; His last selection of works was presented to the public as part of the Official Salon, which opened the same month in Bucharest.&lt;ref name="izsalonul2"&gt;{{ro icon}} I.

===Experimenter===
[[File:Ion Theodorescu-Sion - Tarani din Abrud.jpg|thumb|''Țărani din Abrud'' ("Peasants of [[Abrud]]", ca. 1913)]]

Theodorescu-Sion was probably the most protean Romanian oil painter.&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kzzambacu"/&gt; Sion's interests in trying out formulas was taken with reserve by some in the public. Writing for the Transylvanian readership of ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', in May 1909, [[George Murnu]] contended: "Teodorescu Sion is a new talent that ought to work hard before reaching the profundity of observation which makes one an artist. He is altogether too preoccupied with technical matters and too superficial in his drawing."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[George Murnu]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/luceafarul/1909/BCUCLUJ_FP_280091_1909_008_010.pdf "A VIII-a expoziție a 'Tinerimii Artistice'"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 12/1913, p.221 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, Tăslăuanu was to assess: "Mr. Theodorescu-Sion's art [...] doesn't agree with all people on first impression. [...] The primitive and decorative genre, with simple lines and expressive planes, has not won [it] many adherents. His way of seeing and rendering things seen relates him to the modern art of other countries."&lt;ref name="oct248"/&gt; However, "[his canvasses] are like those women who do not seek to please the eye and to resemble others. Once you get close to them, once you get to know them and study them, you fall under the spell of their profound simplicity and beauty."&lt;ref name="oct249"&gt;Tăslăuanu, p.249&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted in 1913 by ''Luceafărul'' art columnist G. Duma, Sion took his painting "science" from French academies and "the grand masters", techniques from [[Synthetism]] in his religious work, and modern decorative elements in his landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Duma, p.374&lt;/ref&gt; Duma describes Sion's 1913 paintings, especially ''Crai nou'' ("New Moon") and the Crucifixion, as a spiritual journey, and concludes: "In vibrant colors, with well-ordered planes, always directing us to the art of the future, the conscious painter Theodorescu-Sion dreams of and puts into song that [[aria]] which leads to immortality."&lt;ref&gt;Duma, p.376&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians have since disagreed about young Sion's focus on the existential mystery. Mariana Vida calls his early compositions "pathetically Symbolist",&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Mariana Vida, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/ARTE-VIZUALE.-Ipostaze-ale-modernismului-%28I%29*articleID_22882-articles_details.html "Ipostaze ale modernismului (I)"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 503, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but, according to [[Amelia Pavel]], his visions of solitary trees fuse [[Art Nouveau]], "with its twisted lineaments", with elements taken out of [[Expressionism]].&lt;ref name="ap92-93"/&gt; She writes: "the leafless tree [is] a symbol of human alienation, of human powerlessness when faced with the immensity of nature".&lt;ref&gt;Pavel, p.93&lt;/ref&gt; Pavel is explicitly contradicted by fellow Romanian scholar [[Dan Grigorescu]]: "the tree motif is probably closer to [Sion's] decorative-muralist vision of a hallmark monumentality, with its [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnicist]] implications".&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu, p.445&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the Symbolist context, Theodorescu-Sion's primitivism was a form of social investigation. G. Duma was among the early ones to describe Sion as the voice of a specific Romanian sensibility: "Theodorescu-Sion's art is the echo of a people's feelings [...]. It is the [[atavism]] of our purest art [...]. The artist creates, and the people he represents lives on through him, making it known to all other nations with definitive characteristics that [...] the sources of its own dreams are coming to light under a creative power. [...] One feels spiritually connected to Theodorescu-Sion, because one finds, buried into his pastures, the labor and suffering of a race that has produced the painter himself."&lt;ref&gt;Duma, p.373-374&lt;/ref&gt; According to Anca Gogîltan, the ''Tinerimea'' art show of 1910 was a watershed moment in the relationship between urban modern art and the rural majority of Romania, as both Theodorescu-Sion and [[Camil Ressu]] tackled rural life without idyllic conventionalism or moral indignation. She refers in particular to Sion's Transylvanian-themed ''Arat în Munții Abrudului'' ("Ploughing in the Mountains of [[Abrud]]"), "underlining man's civilizing action" rather than expressing "social critique".&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.122-123&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to World War I, Gogîltan argues, Sion and Ressu were the visual partners of Romanian [[agrarianism]] (or [[Poporanism]]), seeking to emphasize, like [[Mihail Sadoveanu]] in the literary field, the "dignity", "resilience" and economic importance of the Romanian peasantry.&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.123, 142-143&lt;/ref&gt;

With his trips in [[Southern Dobruja]], his palette became more luminous, as discussed by Tăslăuanu: "In new Dobruja with its effusion of light and warmth, all colors are lighter; countours more imprecise, less defined; the coloring mixture and contrast more pronounced and richer. In the light-steeped atmosphere of Balcic and [[Ludogorie|Deliorman]], the artist found subjects that agree with his understanding of poetic color."&lt;ref name="oct249"/&gt; By 1919, he was also showing an interest in the landscape of suburbia. Cultural historian [[Sorin Alexandrescu]] argues that the resulting paintings, where the focus is on women and children, have an atmosphere of "calm" and "balance".&lt;ref name="sapitorescii"/&gt; These scenes of family life contrast with his other preoccupations of the late 1910s. As [[Oscar Walter Cisek]] notes, Sion's colors were still luminous, but his canvasses "seemed to have concentrated [...] something from the darkness of the great war", and, for a while, huddled together "boulders of sheer matter".&lt;ref&gt;Cisek, "Ioan Theodorescu-Sion", p.251&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cisek, this preference hurt Sion's art for the next few years, but began to wear out with the completion of ''La isvorul Troiței''.&lt;ref&gt;Cisek, "Ioan Theodorescu-Sion", p.251-252&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of Romanian artistic modernity, the parallel evolution of Sion and [[Iosif Iser]] has intrigued various commentators. Reviewer [[Gheorghe Oprescu]] argues that the resemblance between the two is primarily modulated by Sion's temperamental changes, by his "restless, perhaps less sure of itself, being".&lt;ref name="gol'artrou"&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Gheorghe Oprescu]], [http://www.plural-magazine.com/article_l-art-roumain-de-1800-a-nos-jours.html "L'Art roumain de 1800 a nos jours"], in [http://www.plural-magazine.com/ ''Plural Magazine''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321152817/http://www.plural-magazine.com/ |date=2012-03-21 }}, Nr. 28/2006&lt;/ref&gt; Another interwar critic, [[Aurel D. Broșteanu]], writes that Sion (like Iser, but with more rustic influences) contributed to "the assimilation of a pictorial objectivity", and set it out against "amorphous and disorganized Impressionism."&lt;ref name="adb(31)316"/&gt;

===''Gândirist'' painter===
[[File:Ion Theodorescu-Sion - Strajerii.jpg|thumb|''Străjerii'' ("The Guards", 1925)]]

Theodorescu-Sion's commitment to ''[[Gândirea]]'' aesthetics remains a much debated phase in his activity. Although the magazine's staff columnist noted with delight that he had abandoned his "belabored and obscure" methods for a "direct sensitivity",&lt;ref name="eugc257-258"/&gt; various authors propose that neo-traditionalism was the culmination of Theodorescu-Sion's decades of experiment. As a conclusion to his "calligraphic painting" theory, [[George Călinescu]] notes that "bit by bit, Romanian painting was gliding into the [[Neo-Byzantine]]",&lt;ref name="gc823"/&gt; while Cisek sees the 1920s Sion as a Romanian anti-Impressionist painter of the "volume" and the "classical form", compatible with Cézanne, Derain or [[Max Unold]].&lt;ref&gt;Cisek, "Ioan Theodorescu-Sion", p.250-251&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Tudor Vianu]] refers to ''La izvorul Troiței'' and other works from ca. 1925 as compositions of brute volumes, creating organic relationships between the figures and the landscape, an against claims that Theodorescu-Sion had become a [[Neoclassicism|neoclassic]].&lt;ref&gt;Pavel, p.212-215&lt;/ref&gt; Amelia Pavel additionally writes that the mature Sion returned to painting trees, with Expressionist filtered through Derain's pictorial techniques and, more characteristically, with a growing interest in making others discover the rural landscape of Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Pavel, p.93-94&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Meridiane authors, his "rhythmic sequencing of volumes" shows a mix of influences distilled from contemporary [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and echoes of the Symbolist master [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]].&lt;ref name="vd&amp;al242"&gt;Drăguț ''et al.'', p.242&lt;/ref&gt;

The environment typically depicted in most of Theodorescu-Sion's post-1918 creative periods is that of the mountains, of Argeș and of [[Țara Moților|Motzenland]]. Vianu proposes that Theodorescu-Sion successfully fabricated himself the mentality of mountain dweller, with broken horizons and human figures seen from up close, with a somber palette that suggests "the coolness and secrecy one finds in a forest [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]]."&lt;ref&gt;Pavel, p.211-212, 214&lt;/ref&gt; He notes: "one may document the nature of the man who created this painting style with his famous ''Self-portrait'' he exhibited [in 1925], where the protruding anatomy of his face, the unibrow, the one eye open and scanning, evoke in truth the very image of an ancestor from the mountains."&lt;ref&gt;Pavel, p.211&lt;/ref&gt; Sion's polemic with urban life was becoming explicit. As historian Anca Gogîltan writes, one of his ''Peisaje'' ("Landscapes"), dating ca. 1922, has "the delicate figure of a peasant woman showing up on the edge of a city, dominated by the modern city as a densely packed background, seemingly a screen of geometric shapes."&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.120-121&lt;/ref&gt; Still lifes such as ''Roz și roș'', she notes, show that he catered to the public's growing interest in folk art items, depicting rustic plates or {{not a typo|cruses}}; other works make note of the actual hierarchies of the rural space, showing women thoroughly involved in household chores such as laundering.&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.137-138, 148-149&lt;/ref&gt; As noted in 1931 by Broșteanu, there were three deep influences on Sion's still lifes and portraits: the antique ceramic art of Romania, alongside Derain's pictorial vision, and, "unmistakably" so, the post-Impressionist canvasses of [[Ștefan Luchian]].&lt;ref name="adb(31)316"/&gt;

According to his promoter Cisek, Theodorescu-Sion's organic treatment of nature emanates from "the fundamental law" of Romania's ancient folk arts, namely: "man does not master surrounding nature; he grows from the stony and craggy soil [...] like plants, like trees, like animals."&lt;ref name="ag101"/&gt; This, Cisek argues, was the revelation of a true artistic expression of the Romanian soul, opposed to the idyllic canvasses of Impressionist master [[Nicolae Grigorescu]], but akin to the Poporanist prose of [[Calistrat Hogaș]].&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.101, 126&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, he assessed: "It has been said—and many among the artistically illiterate continue to repeat as much to this day—that only Grigorescu's art can ever be Romanian, and that Theodorescu-Sion's painting can have nothing in common with the substance of our soil. [...] tomorrow perhaps, [he] may find himself able to overturn skeptical impressions and theories".&lt;ref name="owc(26)43"&gt;Cisek (1926), p.43&lt;/ref&gt; Cisek depicts Sion as Romania's "best connoisseur of artistic techniques", with a "sovereign mastery",&lt;ref name="owc(26)43"/&gt; locating him at the opposite end from post-Grigorescu official art. Sion's understanding of national specificity, he argues, had nothing in common with the "mulligan" traditionalism of [[Octav Băncilă]] and [[Kimon Loghi]]: "if Mr. Loghi is a painter, then Teodorescu-Sion must surely be something else entirely! One should bear in mind that Mr. Teodorescu-Sion is still developing, whereas 'Master' Loghi has reached his summit. The summit of mediocrity."&lt;ref&gt;Cisek, "Marius Bunescu", p.281&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarily, [[Nichifor Crainic]], who was a Grigorescu aficionado, posthumously described Sion as Grigorescu's one equal; however, he noted, Sion bowed to commissions, and as such never produced an actual masterpiece.&lt;ref name="nc286"/&gt;

Vianu's friend and ''Gândirea'' contributor [[Lucian Blaga]], a poet-philosopher on the search for Romanian specificity, applauded Theodorescu-Sion's paintings of "super-shepherds and super-peasants" in "Romanian landscapes",&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.126&lt;/ref&gt; while, from another side of modern literature, [[Victor Eftimiu]] celebrated Sion as a "cultured" and "refined" figure among the traditionalists.&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt; Art reviewer [[Petru Comarnescu]] also suggests that Theodorescu-Sion did in fact live up to the expectation of a purely Romanian art, by going back to the "naturalized [[Byzantine art]]" of medieval muralists, particularly so in ''Șipotul''.&lt;ref name="pcvr443-444, 446"/&gt; Although he constructs a similar argument, the religious commentator Crainic finds that Sion was less secure as a Christian artist, even though, he notes, ''Gândirea'' itself encouraged him to paint modern [[Romanian icons]].&lt;ref name="nc287"/&gt;

==="Reactionary" modernist===
The mixture of themes and the controversies surrounding ''Gândirist'' politics have also touched Sion's artistic contributions. In the 1920s, the artistic vision proposed by Sion and Ressu was being contested by the [[avant-garde]] school of ''[[Contimporanul]]''. Also inspired by primitive art, its leaders [[Ion Vinea]] and [[Marcel Janco]] refused to view the others as actual exponents of peasant traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.151&lt;/ref&gt; The more radical experimenters, including Sion's student [[Jacques Hérold]], rejected tame modernism altogether, turning to [[Surrealism]];&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Petre Răileanu]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/ARTE-VIZUALE.-Mitul-transparentei*articleID_2009-articles_details.html "Mitul transparenței"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 115, May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; but young neo-traditionalists such as [[Elena Popea]] found in it a source of inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Aurel D. Broșteanu]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/gandirea/1930/BCUCLUJ_FP_279479_1930_010_011.pdf "Cronica plastică. Elena Popea"], in ''[[Gândirea]]'', Nr. 10-11/1930, p.403 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; Retrospectively, philosopher and curator [[Erwin Kessler]] finds in Sion the exponent of "a [[reactionary]] Romanian modernism": artistic nationalism, coming at a time when all modern Romanian art was divided along ethnic lines ("the ethnic component of classical modernism played an important role, one that should be explained, not occulted").&lt;ref name="ekmam"/&gt; Kessler additionally notes that there is a radical component to Sion's belief in the organic relationship of men and the soil, likening it to the main concepts of Romanian nationalism and traditionalism—from [[A. C. Cuza]]'s [[antisemitism]] to [[Virgil Madgearu]]'s agrarianism, and passing through Blaga's theory on folk architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.126-127&lt;/ref&gt; Also an antisemite, Crainic contended that Sion's art never made an impression on the art market, since the buyers were "mostly Jewish".&lt;ref&gt;Crainic, p.286-287&lt;/ref&gt;

Various critics have noted that Sion's works of the 1920s and '30s are generally awkward,&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kzzambacu"/&gt; "scholastic",&lt;ref name="gol'artrou"/&gt; or geometrical and impersonal.&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.127, 144&lt;/ref&gt; The Meridiane study finds some of his works to be "emphatic", noting that Sion "does not reach into the philosophical meaning of [[Romanian mythology|folk mythology]], retaining only its picturesque exterior."&lt;ref name="vd&amp;al242"/&gt; In some of his late canvasses, Sion makes a comeback to Symbolism, but gives it a "[[Rococo]]" twist, for instance by having his wife pose in [[crinoline]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Angelo Mitchievici]], ''Decadență și decadentism în contextul modernității românești și europene'', [[Editura Curtea Veche]], Bucharest, 2011, p.369-370.  {{ISBN|978-606-588-133-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Ion Theodorescu-Sion's "premature death" was, according to critic I. Zărnescu, a moment of crisis for Romanian art: "[it] leaves an emptiness in our art, just when he, the man of support and encouragement, was most sorely needed."&lt;ref name="izsalonul2"/&gt; The painter received several tributes from his peers. Novelist [[Camil Petrescu]] makes an oblique—and, [[Sorin Alexandrescu]] points out, chronologically inaccurate—mention of his urban landscapes in the 1933 novel ''[[Patul lui Procust]]''; Alexandrescu believes that it serves to amplify the nostalgic mood in that particular fragment of the book.&lt;ref name="sapitorescii"/&gt; In addition to his self-portraits, Sion's likeness was preserved in a bust, the work of sculptor [[Corneliu Medrea]] (according to Nichifor Crainic, Medrea "wonderfully" captured the painter's proud demeanor and physical beauty).&lt;ref name="nc286"/&gt; Medrea also designed Sion's crypt at [[Bellu cemetery]].&lt;ref name="apmnir"/&gt;

Sion's fame declined with the years.&lt;ref name="sapitorescii"/&gt; His cultural legacy was in part preserved by his ''Gândirea'' colleagues, including those who later moved into [[far right]] politics. After [[World War II]] and the establishment of [[Communist Romania|Romania's communist regime]], some of the latter were arrested, while others fled abroad. One of the latter was political journalist [[Pamfil Șeicaru]], who even took some of Sion's paintings with him when he relocated to [[Francoist Spain]].&lt;ref name="nsepistol"/&gt; In 1972, ''Gândirea''{{'}}s pro-[[Fascism|fascist]] editor Crainic had been released from jail and, once [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]], was writing chronicles in ''[[Glasul Patriei]]'', a communist magazine for the [[Romanian diaspora]]. His article on Theodorescu-Sion was read and admired by Șeicaru, who wrote back to thank his former employer.&lt;ref name="nsepistol"/&gt;

The [[National Museum of Art of Romania]] (MNAR) has a sizable Theodorescu-Sion collection. Much of it has been included in the Modern Romanian Art Gallery, reopened and rearranged by MNAR in 2001. Although long expected by critics,&lt;ref name="ekmam"/&gt; this new collection sparked debates: critic Gheorghe Vida found that Sion's presence, like that of other modern artists, was unjustly overshadowed by the inclusion of lesser, "second-shelf", painters of the interwar age.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Gheorghe Vida, [http://www.romlit.ro/la_redeschiderea_galeriei_de_art_romneasc_modern "La redeschiderea Galeriei de artă românească modernă"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 26/2001&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 donation of the [[Lola Schmierer Roth]] collection also supplemented MNAR's Theodorescu-Sion fund with works he had set aside for his former pupil.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Elena Olariu, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Donatii-si-donatori-la-Muzeul-National-de-Arta-al-Romaniei*articleID_14625-articles_details.html "Donații și donatori la Muzeul Național de Artă al României"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 302-303, January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Other sizable Sion collections are held by the art museums of [[Constanța]]&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt; and [[Tulcea]],&lt;ref&gt;Marian Mocanu, [http://www.plural-magazine.com/article_the-tulcea-art-museum-art-pantheon-for-the-romanian-artists.html "The Tulcea Art Museum - Art Pantheon for the Romanian Artists"], in [http://www.plural-magazine.com/ ''Plural Magazine''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321152817/http://www.plural-magazine.com/ |date=2012-03-21 }}, Nr. 31/2008&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Zambaccian Museum]] in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Simina Stan, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/jurnalul-national/farmecul-discret-al-muzeului-zambaccian-ii-print-319212.htm "Farmecul discret al muzeului Zambaccian (II)"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', February 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Still emergent after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], the Romanian art market was ambivalent in its treatment of Theodorescu-Sion's work. Writing in 2009, art critic [[Pavel Șușară]] denounced "an unacceptable disagreement" between Sion's status as a "first-class artist" and the low starting prices of his canvasses, as opposed to the "exorbitant sums" fetched by painters such as [[Sabin Bălașa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Pavel Șușară]], [http://www.romlit.ro/ntre_vocaia_cultural_i_provocrile_pieei "Între vocația culturală și provocările pieței"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 6/2009&lt;/ref&gt; That year, his ''Cele trei vârste'' ("The Three Ages") was sold for 32,000 [[Romanian leu|lei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Veronica Marinescu, [http://www.curierulnational.ro/Specializat/2009-11-04/Un+Tonitza+tranzactionat+pentru+370.000+lei,+la+Casa+Alis "Un Tonitza tranzacționat pentru 370.000 lei, la Casa Alis"], in ''[[Curierul Național]]'', November 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in Theodorescu-Sion's work appears to have renewed itself by 2010, when the auctioned Sions fetched prices of the highest range.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Veronica Marinescu, [http://www.curierulnational.ro/Specializat/2010-06-09/Ion+Theodorescu+Sion,+in+topul+vanzarilor "Ion Theodorescu Sion, în topul vânzărilor"], in ''[[Curierul Național]]'', June 9, 2010; [http://www.curierulnational.ro/Specializat/2010-07-28/Un+Theodorescu+Sion,+la+65.000+lei "Un Theodorescu Sion, la 65.000 lei"], in ''Curierul Național'', July 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The avant-garde's polemic with Sion's neo-traditionalism continues posthumously. In 2009, Erwin Kessler organized a collective show with the theme "Pork". Kessler explained that the pig, the staple food of modern Romania's [[consumerism]], stood to replace the sheep as the "[[totem]]" of Theodorescu-Sion and Nicolae Grigorescu.&lt;ref name="ekpigway"&gt;[[Erwin Kessler]], [http://www.plural-magazine.com/article_the-pig-way.html "The Pig Way"], in [http://www.plural-magazine.com/ ''Plural Magazine''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321152817/http://www.plural-magazine.com/ |date=2012-03-21 }}, Nr. 33/2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mpdecembr"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Plămădeală, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/ARTE-VIZUALE.-Decembrie-luna-a-expozitiilor-de-grup*articleID_22956-articles_details.html "Decembrie – lună a expozițiilor de grup"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 505, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The tongue-in-cheek exhibit featured [[conceptual art]]works by [[Matei Bejenaru]], [[Dumitru Gorzo]], [[Ion Grigorescu]], [[Dan Perjovschi]] and various others.&lt;ref name="ekpigway"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mpdecembr"/&gt;

Carroll competed in the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 7)|seventh series]] of ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' at the age of 14, finishing as the runner-up. As an actor,  he has appeared in two series of the [[CBBC Channel]] show ''Ministry of Curious Stuff'' and most recently has starred in the new series of ''[[Trollied]]''. Carroll, whose [[cerebral palsy]] is often a subject of his act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Young BGT comedian Jack Carroll tickles the judges' funny bones|url=http://shows.stv.tv/britains-got-talent/news/221300-bgt-comedian-with-cerebral-palsy-jack-caroll-tickles-judges-funny-bones/|publisher=[[STV (TV channel)|STV]]|date=13 April 2013|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; won a [[Pride of Britain]] award in 2012.

==Stand-up career==
In 2010, at the age of 12, Carroll came to comedian [[Jason Manford]]'s attention when he saw a video of Carroll performing at his parents' wedding anniversary.

'''John Harold Hewitt''' (28 October 1907 – 22 June 1987), who was born in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], was the most significant Belfast [[poet]] to emerge before the 1960s generation of [[Irish poetry|Northern Irish poets]] that included [[Seamus Heaney]], [[Derek Mahon]] and [[Michael Longley]]. He was appointed the first writer-in-residence at [[Queen's University Belfast]] in 1976. His collections include ''The Day of the Corncrake'' (1969) and ''Out of My Time: Poems 1969 to 1974'' (1974). He was also made a Freeman of the City of Belfast in 1983, and was awarded [[honorary doctorate]]s the [[University of Ulster]] and Queen's University Belfast.&lt;ref name="Collection"&gt;[http://library.ulster.ac.uk/craine/hewitt/life.htm John Hewitt (1907–1987)], John Hewitt Collection, University of Ulster, accessed 27 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

From November 1930 to 1957, Hewitt held positions in the [[Belfast Museum &amp; Art Gallery]]. His radical socialist ideals proved unacceptable to the Belfast Unionist establishment and he was passed over for promotion in 1953. Instead in 1957 he moved to [[Coventry]], a city still rebuilding following [[Coventry Blitz|its devastation]] during [[World War II]] . Hewitt was appointed Director of the [[Herbert Art Gallery &amp; Museum]] where he worked until retirement in 1972.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

Hewitt had an active political life, describing himself as "a man of the left", and was involved in the [[British Labour Party]], the [[Fabian Society]] and the Belfast Peace League.&lt;ref name="Left"&gt;[http://library.ulster.ac.uk/craine/hewitt/life.htm#left John Hewitt: Man of the Left], John Hewitt Collection, University of Ulster, accessed 27 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He was attracted to the [[Ulster]] dissenting tradition and was drawn to a concept of regional identity within the island of Ireland, describing his identity as Ulster, Irish, British and European.&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;[http://www.johnhewitt.org/biography.php Biography: John Harold Hewitt (1907–1987)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070731110108/http://www.johnhewitt.org/biography.php |date=31 July 2007 }}, John Hewitt International Summer School, accessed 27 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; John Hewitt officially opened the Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre (BURC) Offices on [[May Day|Mayday]] 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avecsolutions.net/book/TheJohnHewitt41-44.pdf Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928074401/http://www.avecsolutions.net/book/TheJohnHewitt41-44.pdf |date=28 September 2007 }}, ''Making Good Money in Belfast: Social Economy Businesses'', p. 44, accessed 27 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Words on the Cushendun Stone - geograph.org.uk - 247602.jpg|thumb|Words by John Hewitt on the Cushendun Stone.]]
His life and work are celebrated in two prominent ways – the annual John Hewitt International Summer School – and, less conventionally, a Belfast pub is named after him – the John Hewitt Bar and Restaurant, which is situated on the city's Donegall Street and which opened in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avecsolutions.net/book/TheJohnHewitt41-44.pdf The John Hewitt: More than just a great pub] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928074401/http://www.avecsolutions.net/book/TheJohnHewitt41-44.pdf |date=28 September 2007 }}, ''Making Good Money in Belfast: Social Economy Businesses'', pp. 41–44, accessed 27 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] was named after him as he officially opened the Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre, which owns the establishment. It is a popular meeting place for local writers, musicians, journalists, students and artists. Both the [[Belfast Festival at Queen's]] and the [[Belfast Film Festival]] use the venue to stage events.

==Hewitt's life and writing==
{{more citations needed|date=March 2009}}

===Early life===
After attending Agnes Street National School, Hewitt attended the [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution]] from 1919 to 1920 &lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; before moving to [[Methodist College Belfast]], where he was a keen cricketer.  In 1924, he started an English degree at the [[Queen's University of Belfast]], obtaining a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1930,&lt;ref name="PRONI"&gt;[http://www.proni.gov.uk/records/private/hewitt.htm The John Hewitt Papers (D/3838)], [[Public Record Office of Northern Ireland]], accessed 27 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; which he followed by obtaining a teaching qualification from [[Stranmillis College]], Belfast.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; During these years, his calling to radical and socialist causes deepened; he heard [[James Larkin]] address a Labour rally, began to write for a range of Trades Union and Socialist publications, and co-founded a journal entitled ''Iskra''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Hewitt also attended the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] Annual Conference as a Belfast City delegate in 1929 and 1930. He resisted the advocacy of a workers’ republic in the party's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/h/Hewitt_J/life.htm |title =John Hewitt: Life, &amp;c. |accessdate =2008-01-05 |publisher =Ricorso }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, Hewitt was appointed Art Assistant at the [[Ulster Museum|Belfast Museum and Art Gallery]], where amongst other duties, he gave public lectures on art, at one of which he met Roberta "Ruby" Black, whom he was to marry in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.niliteraryarchive.com/content/%E2%80%8Bjohn-harold-hewitt|title=John Hewitt|last=admin|first=|date=2016-06-14|website=www.niliteraryarchive.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberta was also a convinced Socialist, and the couple became members of the [[Independent Labour Party]], the Belfast Peace League, the [[Left Book Club]]&lt;ref name="Left"/&gt; and the [[Liberty (pressure group)|British Civil Liberties Union]].

===Early writing===
Hewitt began experimenting with poetry while still a schoolboy at Methodist College in the 1920s. Typically thorough, his notebooks from these years are filled with hundreds of poems, in dozens of styles; Hewitt's main influences at this time included [[William Blake]], [[William Morris]] and [[W. B. Yeats]], and for the most part the verse is either highly [[Romanticism|romantic]], or strongly [[Socialism|socialist]], a theme which increased in prominence as the 1930s began. Morris is the key figure, combining both these strains, and allowing Hewitt to articulate the radical, [[Dissenter|dissenting]] strain which he inherited from his [[Methodist]] forbearers, including his father.

As the 1920s moved into the 1930s, Hewitt's writing began to develop and mature. Firstly, his role models (including [[Vachel Lindsay]]) became more modern; secondly, he discovered in Chinese poetry a voice which was "quiet and undemonstrative but clear and direct",&lt;ref&gt;from his unpublished autobiography, ''A North Light''&lt;/ref&gt; and which answered a part of Hewitt's temperament which had been suppressed. Finally, and most importantly, he began his lifelong work of excavation and discovery of the poetry of Ulster, starting with [[Richard Rowley]], [[Joseph Campbell (poet)|Joseph Campbell]] and [[George William Russell]] (AE). This research culminated, in part, with the publications of ''Fibres, Fabric and Cordage'' in 1948, ''Rhyming Weavers and other Country Poets of Antrim and Down'' (based on his MA thesis, ''Ulster Poets 1800–1870'' of 1951) in 1974, and a book called ''The Rhyming Weavers'' in 1979. All of these publications and more, were based on his interest in the [[Weaver Poets|Ulster rhyming weaver poets]] of the 19th century, such as [[Henry MacDonald Flecher]], [[David Herbison]], [[Alexander MacKenzie (poet)|Alexander MacKenzie]], [[James MacKowen]], and [[James Orr (poet)|James Orr]].

Hewitt himself felt that his [[juvenilia]] ended with the poem ''Ireland'' (1932), which he placed at the start of his ''Collected Poems'' (1968), and indeed it is more complex than most of his earlier work, and begins his lifelong preoccupation with bleak landscapes of bog and rock; with exile, and with the nature of belonging.

===The 1930s===
The 1930s was a period of transition in Hewitt's poetry, one in which he began seriously to address the tortured history of his native province, and the contradictions between his love for the people and the landscape, his inspiration in the radical dissenting tradition, and the bloody, fratricidal conflicts which scar Northern Ireland to this day. A key text is ''The Bloody Brae: A Dramatic Poem'' (finished in 1936, though not broadcast – on the Northern Ireland Home Service of the [[BBC]] – until 1954; the Belfast Lyric Players performed a stage version in 1957, which they revived in 1986), which tells of a legendary massacre of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] troops in [[Islandmagee]], County Antrim, in 1642. John Hill, one of the soldiers who has been racked by guilt since he participated in the slaughter, returns many years later to beg forgiveness. This he receives from the ghost of one of his victims, a gesture which she wraps in a condemnation of his self-indulgence, luxuriating in his guilt rather than taking positive action to combat bigotry. Another theme which was to become a fixture in Hewitt's poetry also first appears in ''The Bloody Brae''; that is, a bold assertion of the right of his people  to live in Ulster, rooted in their hard work and commitment to it:
:This is my country; my grandfather came here
:and raised his walls and fenced the tangled waste
:and gave his years and strength into the earth
Hewitt is not claiming a right of Imperial possession here; rather, the right to live alongside the native population.

Also in the 1930s, Hewitt was involved in with a group of young artists and sculptors known as the 'Ulster Unit', and acted as their secretary.&lt;ref name="Collection"/&gt;

===1940s and 1950s===

During the 1940s and 1950s, Hewitt increasingly played the role of reviewer and art critic. He gained an [[Master of Arts|MA]] from [[Queen's University Belfast]], with a thesis on Ulster poets from 1800–1870, in 1951.&lt;ref name="Collection"/&gt; In 1951 he had been appointed deputy director and keeper of art at the [[Belfast Museum and Art Gallery]] but in 1957, Hewitt left to take up the position of Art Director at the [[Herbert Art Gallery and Museum]] in [[Coventry]], a position he held until 1972.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Frank Ormsby, ‘Hewitt, John Harold (1907–1987)’, rev.

'''Gonpo Tseten Rinpoche''', (1906–1991), [[Dzogchen]] master, author, painter, sculptor, and teacher of the [[Nyingma]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

==Biography==

Gönpo Tseten was born in 1906 in [[Amdo]], the eastern province of Tibet, into a family heritage of [[ngakpa]]s. At the age of seven he was sent to Sangchen Mingye Ling, a Nyingmapa monastery. At the age of 15, having shown great promise as a future teacher, he studied with Kargi Tertön and accomplished the preliminary practices of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

At Sangchen Mingye Ling, Gönpo Tseten continued his Dharma studies and the traditional Tibetan arts and sciences. It was at this time that he began to display great skill in drawing, painting, and sculpture. In 1925, at the age of 18, he completed two images of Thousand-Armed [[Avalokiteshvara]], each standing over six feet high.

About the age of twenty he married and had a son, Pema Rigdzin. [However, after two years he and his wife separated. He later married again, this time to Drolma Chi with whom he happily spent the remainder of his time in [[Tibet]] before 1959. Three years before the Chinese army arrived, he moved to Lhasa with his wife and son. Unfortunately, in the terrible conditions during the Chinese invasion of Tibet, Gönpo Tseten became separated from his wife and son, who did not escape.]

He then undertook a journey of twenty days in order to study for a year with the Tertön Choling Tuching Dorje, a disciple of [[Dodrupchen]] Rinpoche. After this for four months he received the transmission and empowerments of the [[Rinchen Terdzod]] from the great Dzogchen master Bathur Khenpo Thubten Chöphel, who was also a guru of [[Dilgo Khyentse]] Rinpoche and the 6th [[Dzogchen Rinpoche.]] Later, the ngakpa Gönpo Tsering taught him Tu, the art of overcoming enemies. This was essential since his gompa in Amdo needed protection from surrounding afflictions, including ruthless bandits and wild animals. After this, he studied sutra and tantra, including the Yönten Dzö, at Sukchen Tago Gompa in [[Golok]], which was established by the First [[Dodrupchen]] Rinpoche in 1799.

His student Ngawang Khedup, who studied with Lama Gönpo in Clement Town, Dhera Dun, India, and accompanied him when he came to America, reported that among the other places Gönpo Tseten studied in his youth was one of the most famous of Tibet’s tantric colleges (Rabgon Ngakmang – "the place of many Tantrikas"), where the most secret yogic practices were taught in depth and practiced to completion. At the end of the [[tummo]] course, as a test of their accomplishment, the students went to the deep holes dug in the ground behind the buildings on a cold winter's night. The student would then go down to the bottom of a hole and see how many wet blankets could be dried out in a single night by inner heat. The exuberant students would also see how far that they could ascend into the air above the hole, to discover which among them could rise up the highest. "I was told," Ngawang wrote, "that people standing at a distance away could see Lama Gönpo rising above, not just the other yogis, but also the row of buildings that were in front!" Having himself brought [[tantra|tantric]] [[siddhi]]s to fruition, Lama Gönpo understood and strongly emphasized to his students that such outward signs must be the fruit of inner realization rather than goals in themselves.

In 1932 he met his root guru, the Longchen Nyingtik lineage holder Patrul Rinpoche Kunzang Shenpen Özer of Tsö, the tulku of [[Patrul Rinpoche]] Chökyi Wangpo, who was himself a heart-son of [[Adzom Drukpa]] Drodul Pawo Dorje. According to the late [[Dilgo Khyentse]] Rinpoche, in his autobiography Brilliant Moon, Patrul Rinpoche of Tsö was an emanation of [[Avalokiteshvara]] and a very unusual person who would feed hundreds of beggars at his monastery upon condition that they enter the gate of the Dharma and undertake [[ngöndro]] preliminary practices.

Under his guru's direction he did Richö, a solitary mountain retreat, for four years including [[ngöndro]], [[Lung (Tibetan Buddhism)#Tsa Lung|tsa-lung]] and [[Dzogchen]] progressing through the stages of the path to the realization of the supreme state. At the end of his retreat Patrul Rinpoche of Tsö asked him to teach others and, in 1936, he was given the role of vajra acharya to teach Patrul Rinpoche's disciples in the master's absence. As well, he was given the knowledge-holder name Rigdzin Trinlé Özer.

For two years he taught [[Lung (Tibetan Buddhism)#Tsa Lung|tsa-lung]] and [[Dzogchen]] at Patrul Rinpoche's monastery in Tsö. He then did further retreat for one year to deepen his realization before going to Dzogchen Monastery in 1939 and 1940. Lama Gönpo then returned to his own gompa, Sangchen Mingye Ling, bringing with him the Kangyur, Rigdzin Jigmé Lingpa's Ton Bum, Yonden Subdon, and other profound texts totaling 1,552 pages.

At Sangchen Mingye Ling he became [[khenpo]], and also did another several years in retreat. Converting his monastery to one which concentrated on the Longchen Nyingtik teachings of Rigdzin [[Jigmé Lingpa]] he would teach the Kunzang Lamé Shyalung of [[Patrul Chökyi Wangpo]]. In the winter he taught tsa-lung, and in the summer, [[Yeshe Lama]]. His fame spread far and wide like the rays of the sun.

Numerous lamas asked him to teach at their gompas. He taught at eight monasteries throughout Amdo, teaching twice a year at each. From 1957 to 1959 he taught at the renowned [[Tsering Jong]] Monastery of Kunkhyen [[Jigme Lingpa]] himself near [[Lhasa]].

In 1959, Lama Gönpo managed to escape from Tibet. Having arrived in India, Lama Gönpo steadfastly continued to teach the Dharma far and wide, and received numerous teachings from other exiled teachers. There, he wrote a compact edition of the Kunzang Lamé Shyalung. To dispel obstacles, he did a three-month retreat on Vajrakilaya at the residence of the [[Dalai Lama]]. At the end of his retreat the Dalai Lama presented him with an offering of a [[phurba]] hidden as a [[Terma (religion)|terma]] treasure by [[Padmasambhava]], Guru Rinpoche, and discovered by the great [[terton]] [[Nyang Ral Nyima Özer]] (1124–1192), the first of the five sovereign terma revealers. Much later, since no material object was important to him in the least unless it could serve the dharma, due to his foreknowledge, at the appropriate time before he departed for the [[Copper-Coloured Mountain]] in 1991, Lama Gönpo transferred this precious artifact to a generous benefactor and gave all of the large donation he received to help fund the community of nuns he was guiding in [[Amdo]].

From 1967 to 1978 Lama Gönpo taught at the Nyingmapa Lamas College at Clement Town, Dehra Dun, India, teaching the entire range of the preliminary and advanced practices. In 1979 Lama Gönpo was requested to come and teach in the United States by [[Gyatrul Rinpoche]]. From 1979 to early 1982, accompanied by his consort Pema Lhanzam, he taught mainly in California, where he taught almost the entire [[Longchen Nyingtig]] cycle, including the [[Yeshe Lama]] to his devoted students. He was particularly skillful in his guidance of disciples, and could be very gentle, paternal, warm, and encouraging or forthrightly challenging, always expecting those who studied with him to make the greatest possible effort in their practice.

Once, after the appearance of unmistakable signs, Lama Gönpo told a disciple, "You are definitely the incarnation of a yogi in Tibet who did a certain Dorje Phurba practice." When the student asked if it were possible to discover more about this, his teacher casually replied, "Of course, but inquiring into past lives is not important for most people. It takes away attention from the key point. The key point for is to bring to fulfillment the practice in this very lifetime." A few days thereafter the vidyadhara bestowed the necessary empowerments on the student in order for him to continue the path his teacher had identified.

While in America, Lama Gönpo was an inexhaustible river of extensive empowerments and teachings on every level of the [[Longchen Nyingtig]], from teachings on the [[Nine Yanas]], to Rigdzin [[Jigme Lingpa]]'s kyérim text [[Staircase to Akanishtha]], to one of the first comprehensive [[Chö]] empowerments and teachings given in North America, Laughter of the Dakinis, [[Phowa]], [[Shitro]], [[Rigdzin Düpa]], among many others, as well as teachings on the nature of mind, both [[Semdé]] (Mind Category) and [[Longdé]] (Space Category) all the way up to and including the unsurpassed [[Yeshe Lama]], all transmitted from the perspective of highest [[Dzogchen]] [[Atiyoga]].

When the Chinese government allowed exiled Tibetans to return in 1982 Lama Gönpo, despite the fact that he had attained the age of 76, courageously returned to [[Amdo]], the region of his birth, and gathered a dedicated community of practitioners, who were mainly nuns, to help in the revival of the Dharma in the Land of Snows. After visiting America once more for a brief period, Lama Gönpo remained in Tibet until his death at the age of 85.

Before Lama Gönpo left the USA the first time, at a final interview with one of his students, who was himself embarking on the path of a spiritual teacher, the disciple humbly requested his root guru, "This is the last time we will meet in this life. What are your essential instructions for me?" The great [[vidyadhara]] answered simply, "Always teach pure dharma, and always rest in rigpa." In these two phrases Lama Gönpo Tseten set forth a succinct and accurate description of his own life and teaching.

Lama Gönpo Tseten was deeply humble and comfortable in all situations, both high and low, and was immune to praise or blame. He had no interest in founding organizations or building dharma centers and so left that activity for other masters to accomplish. Although he himself possessed unimpeded insight and had the power to authoritatively recognize and enthrone tulkus, which he occasionally did as he foresaw would be helpful, Lama Gönpo did not consider his own enthronement as a reincarnate master to be necessary and so dispensed with that formality.

As were Choje [[Longchen Rabjam]], Kunkhyen [[Jigme Lingpa]], and Jamyang [[Khyentse Wangpo]], Gonpo Tseten Rinpoche was considered to be a secret emanation of Panchen [[Vimalamitra]], who brought the Dzogchen teachings to Tibet. This fact is alluded to in his long life prayer, written by H.E. Dungse [[Thinley Norbu]] Rinpoche of Pemakö:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Of the millions of knowledge-holders
The chief is the Supreme [[Vimalamitra]],
Whose light-ray sunlike activity you invite as guests
Into the lotus-like Wisdom Mansion of your heart.
Glorious teacher Rigdzin Trinley Ozer, may you live long.
The Dzogpa Chenpo is the Dakinis' luminous heart-essence,
The Supreme Dharma's excellent activity spread widely like pollen.
May your fortunate disciples gathering like bees to honey,
Fly in the Dharmakaya's sky.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although he had planned to depart this world on the tenth day of the sixth Tibetan month, that day being special to [[Guru Rinpoche]], Lama Gönpo kindly acceded to his students' request and delayed his departure three days. Like [[Kunzang Sherab]] the 1st Throneholder of [[Palyul]], and [[Terdak Lingpa]] the founder of [[Mindrolling Monastery]], just before his [[parinirvana]] the [[Vidyadhara]] Trinlé Özer, as he had predicted, saw the [[dakini]]s coming to convey his consciousness to the Copper-Coloured Mountain, Guru Rinpoche's pure land. Lama Gönpo made beautiful inviting [[mudras]] as his physical body was dying, and passed into the sphere of ultimate truth on the 13th day of the sixth Tibetan month in the Iron-Sheep Year of the 17th [[Rabjung]], 1991.

Lama Gönpo mentioned in 1981 that he would not reincarnate as a conventional tulku, but would send emanations directly from the [[Copper Colored Mountain]].

__FORCETOC__

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Born in Saint Petersburg, Yankovskaya studied ballet between the ages of three- and five-years-old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://operawire.com/qa-chicago-opera-theater-music-director-lidiya-yankovskaya-on-future-goals-conducting-and-the-future-of-opera/|title=Q&amp;A: Chicago Opera Theater Music Director Lidiya Yankovskaya on Future Goals, Conducting and the Future of Opera|website=operawire.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied music from the age of five, playing piano and singing in the Saint Petersburg Children’s Choir of Radio and Television. She attended performances with her mother regularly, citing a production of [[The Love for Three Oranges|Prokofiev's ''The Love for Three Oranges'']] at the Mariinsky Theater as one of her first experiences with opera.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Out of Russia: A Conversation with Lidiya Yankovskaya|last=Scorca|first=Marc A.|date=|work=Opera America Magazine|access-date=|month=|year=2017|issue=Fall 2017|pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the anti-Semitic climate in Russia, Yankovskaya immigrated to the United States with her mother at nine-years-old.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They settled in upstate New York, where Yankovskaya attended Hebrew day school.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nationalsawdust.org/thelog/2017/11/08/meet-the-ns-artist-in-residence-lidiya-yankovskaya-activist-conductor/|title=Meet the NS Artist-in-Residence: Lidiya Yankovskaya, Activist Conductor|work=The Log Journal|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Educational background ===
Yankovskaya's mother prioritized her musical development, enrolling her daughter at [[Guilderland High School]] in Albany, NY. Yankovskaya also joined the selective private teaching studio of piano duo Vladimir Pleshakov and Elena Winther, and began studying the violin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At 17, she had become concertmaster of Guilderland's orchestra and won the school's concerto competition for a performance of [[Piano Concerto No. 12 (Mozart)|Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 12 (K. 414)]]. During rehearsals, conductor Jeff Herchenroder suggested that Yankovskaya try leading from the piano. She later made her conducting debut at Herchenroder's request, leading the orchestra for the third movement of [[Symphony No. 7 (Dvořák)|Dvořák's Symphony No.7 in D minor]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After graduation, Yankovskaya attended [[Vassar College]], where she studied piano, voice, and conducting. She switched her focus from piano performance to conducting during her junior year. Yankovskaya led her own ensemble of approximately 55 instrumentalists and 30 singers in regular performances of contemporary works.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Yankovskaya holds a master's degree in conducting from [[Boston University]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2017/05/18/refugee-orchestra-project-spreads-musical-message-inclusion/7slW7KGhCdCqPWMZ3CqAFK/story.html|title=Refugee Orchestra Project spreads a musical message of inclusion - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Yankovskaya was one of six conductors selected to join the [[Dallas Opera]]'s inaugural Hart Institute for Women Conductors and received honorable mention from [[Marin Alsop]]'s Taki Concordia Conducting Fellowship.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Yankovskaya was appointed the music director of [[Chicago Opera Theater]] in June 2017 and began regular conducting duties with the 2018-19 season.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She is the first female music director at Chicago Opera Theater.

== Social and political involvement ==
During the [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugee crisis]], Yankovskaya started a grassroots performance ensemble that would become known as the [[Refugee Orchestra Project]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The first performance by the ensemble took place on May 10, 2016 in Cambridge, MA. Growing interest on social media led to concerts in Boston, New York City, and Washington, DC. The orchestra joined the National Sawdust artists-in-residence for the 2017-18 season.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Image:Programming light board.jpg|thumb|right|The light board operator programs the light board along with the lighting designer]]
The '''light board operator''' (commonly referred to as the "Light Op" or "Board Op") or moving light programmer, is the [[Electrician (theatre)|electrician]] who operates and/or programs the [[light board]]. Depending on the scale and type of production, the board op may be responsible for [[Stage lighting instrument|conventional]] or [[Intelligent lighting|automated]] lighting fixtures, as well as practicals and, in some instances, controlling video as well.  

Sometimes, most commonly in small productions, the Light board Operator will also be the [[stage manager]]. Another variation in smaller productions has the responsibilities of Light board Operator and [[Sound operator]] combined into one position. In the smallest productions, all three of these functions are done by one person. For productions where lighting and sound are operated by a single person, as well productions where sound needs to be exactly timed with lighting, it is not unusual to use [[MIDI Show Control]] (MSC), [[Open Sound Control]] (OSC), or Timecode ([[SMPTE_time_code|SMPTE Time Code]]) to synchronize the lighting, video, and audio consoles.

The light board operator may, in some cases, also be the [[lighting designer]] for a production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmproductionroles11med23.wikispaces.com/Lighting filmproductionroles.com Lighting]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==

The light op has many responsibilities in theater, especially in small productions.  For small productions, the light op may also be the [[lighting designer]] and [[master electrician]], and is therefore required to create a lighting plot, and perform a complete hang and focus in addition to their duties as board operator. In more professional environments, the light board operator is a highly specialized professional who is usually well versed in the intricacies of a wide variety of lighting instruments and control consoles, and able to easily program complex lighting cues involving multiple [[Light fixture|fixtures]] and other components. &lt;ref&gt;[http://getinmedia.com/careers/lighting-console-operator getinmedia.com careers lighting console operator] &lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[technical rehearsal]]s, the light board operator usually programs the lighting console with the assistance of the [[lighting designer]] and [[stage manager]]. In situations where manual boards are being used, the light board operator will work with the lighting designer and the stage manager to practice the timing of the lighting changes.

During the performance, the light board operator is often on headset with the Deputy Stage Manager, and multiple other members of the [[running crew]]. Their responsibility lies primarily in advancing the cues under the direction of the deputy stage manager. It is important that light board operators be familiar with the [[light plot]], as they may be called upon to make "on the fly" changes to accommodate unexpected circumstances that occur during the production.

'''Theatre festivals''' are amongst the earliest types of festival. Classical Greek theatre was associated with religious festivals dedicated to [[Dionysus]], called the City Dionysia. The medieval [[mystery play]]s were presented at the major Christian feasts. Theatre as an everyday part of life is a comparatively recent phenomenon.

In recent years, theatre festivals have been established to promote various types of theatre, such as the works of [[William Shakespeare]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]]. Many festivals, such as those in the [[fringe theatre]] movement, promote the work of beginning playwrights (called "new writing") and performers.

This is a list of [[theatre festivals]] around the world:

A '''literary award''' is an [[award]] presented in recognition of a particularly lauded [[Literature|literary]] piece or body of work.  It is normally presented to an [[author]].

==Organizations==
Most literary awards come with a corresponding award [[ceremony]]. Many awards are structured with one organization (usually a non-profit organization) as the presenter and public face of the award, and another organization as the financial sponsor or backer, who pays the prize remuneration and the cost of the ceremony and public relations, typically a corporate sponsor who may sometimes attach their name to the award (such as the [[Orange Prize]]).

==Types of awards==
There are awards for several forms of writing such as [[poetry]] and [[novels]].  Many awards are also dedicated to a certain [[genre]] of fiction or non-fiction writing (such as [[science fiction]] or [[politics]]). There are also awards dedicated to works in individual languages, e.g. the [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), and the [[Camões Prize]] ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]), and the [[Man Booker Prize]], the [[Pulitzer Prize]], and the [[Hugo Awards]] ([[English Language|English]]).   

Some of the most notable literary prizes include the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], the [[Franz Kafka Prize]] and the [[Jerusalem Prize]].  

There are also spoof awards, such as [[Bad Sex in Fiction Award|The ''Literary Review'' Bad Sex in Fiction Award]], the [[Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year]], and the [[Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest|Bulwer-Lytton Fiction]] and [[Lyttle Lytton Contest]]s, which are both given to deliberately bad sentences.

There are also literary awards that are targeted specifically to encourage the writing of African-Americans and authors of African descent. Two national awards that do this are [[Ernest J. Gaines]] Award for Literary Excellence, which was established in 2007 by the [[Baton Rouge Area Foundation]], and the [[Hurston-Wright Legacy Award]], which is given by the [[National Community of Black Writers]].

==Criticism==
Australian author [[Richard Flanagan]] wrote a critique of literary awards, saying "National prizes are often a barometer of [[bourgeois]] bad taste."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/a-loss-for-words-20120615-20exa.html |title=A loss for words |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=June 16, 2012 |accessdate=June 16, 2012 |author=Richard Flanagan |authorlink=Richard Flanagan}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says juries can be influenced by vendettas, paybacks and payoffs, "most judges are fair-minded people. But hate, conceit and jealousy are no less human attributes than wisdom, judgment and knowledge." Book prizes will sometimes compete with one another, and these goals don't always coincide with anointing the best winner. Sometimes juries can't decide between two contentious books so they will compromise with a third inoffensive bland book. He says there are now so many awards and prizes it has diluted the prestige of being a prize-winning book. Flanagan clarifies he is not against literary awards, but believes they should not be taken too seriously as a form of support for literary culture.

[[File:Brooklyn Museum 22.596 Beadwork Headdress for Mbudye Official.jpg|thumbnail|Beadwork Headdress for Mbudye Official, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]
''Lukasa'', "the long hand" (or claw), is a sophisticated memory device that was created, manipulated and protected by the Bambudye, a once powerful secret society of the [[Luba people|Luba]]. ''Lukasa'' are examples of [[Luba art]].

==History of the ''lukasa''==
The story of the ''lukasa'' is closely associated with the history of the [[Luba Kingdom|Luba kingdom]], which dominated most of northern Shaba during the eighteenth century and the first half of the nineteenth century. No candidate for political office could receive his title without first becoming a member of the Bambudye society, and the ruler of the Luba kingdom held the highest ranking Bambudye title. Reefe states that while it is not possible to date the origins of the ''lukasa'', the high degree of integration of the lukasa into the structure of the Bambudye society and into the oral lore of the Luba kingdom strongly suggests that this art form is of considerable antiquity.

==A Luba memory device==
Central to Luba artistry, ''lukasa'' aids memory and the making of histories. Stools, staffs, figures, and complex choreographies complement the ''lukasa'' as Luba culture is remembered, produced, and transformed. 

''Lukasa'' memory boards are hourglass-shaped wooden tablets that are covered with multicolored beads, shells and bits of metal, or are incised or embossed with carved symbols.&lt;ref name="Reefe 1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reefe|first=Thomas|title=Lukasa: A Luba Memory Device|journal=African Arts|date=July 1978|volume=10|issue=4|pages=48–50, 88|doi=10.2307/3335144|jstor=3335144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colors and configurations of beads or ideograms serve to stimulate the recollection of important people, places, things, relationships and events as court historians narrate the origins of Luba authority. A ''lukasa'' serves as an archive for the topographical and chronological mapping of political histories and other data sets.&lt;ref name="Visions of Africa Luba" /&gt;

Lukasa are approximately the same size (20-25 centimeters long and about 13 centimeters wide) and have the same rectangular dish shape. A row of carved mounds called ''lukala'' runs across their concave surface, dividing it in half. Beads and shells are attached to the board by small slivers of wood or hand-made iron wedges driven through their centers, and cowrie shells are frequently attached at the top and bottom. Beads are arranged in three ways: a large bead surrounded by smaller beads, a line of beads, and one isolated bead. Each configuration lends itself to the transmission of certain kinds of information. Board surfaces also have holes and lines cut into them.&lt;ref name="Reefe 1978" /&gt;

==Usage==
Court historians known as ''bana balute'' ("men of memory") run their fingertips across the surface of a ''lukasa'' or point to its features while reciting genealogies, king lists, maps of protocol, migration stories, and the great Luba Epic, a preeminent oral narrative that records how the culture heroes, Mbidi Kiluwe and his son Kalala Ilunga, introduced royal political practices and etiquette.&lt;ref name="Visions of Africa Luba"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Mary Nooter Roberts &amp; Allen F.|title=Luba|year=2007|publisher=5 continents|location=Milan|isbn=8874392974}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Luba, how an object looks dictates how well it works.&lt;ref name="Loughran 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Loughran|first=Kristyne|title=Art of Being Tuareg: Sahara Nomads in a Modern World|year=2006|publisher=University of Washington Press for the Canton Center for Visual Arts, Stanford University, and the UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History|location=Seattle|pages=194–201|authorlink=Does It Have to Be Beautiful to Empower?|editor=T. Seligman and K. Loughran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture heroes are identifiable by beads whose colors have a fan of connotations triggering remembrance of their deeds and exploits, as well as their qualities and physical appearance. For example, Nkongolo Mwamba, the tyrannical anti-hero of the Luba charter, is always represented by a red bead, for he is the red-skinned rainbow-serpent associated with bloody violence. Blue beads (considered "black") stand for Mbidi Kiluwe, the protagonist and culture-bearer of kingship whose skin is shiningly black like that of a bull buffalo, symbol of ambivalent power and secret potential.&lt;ref name="Roberts 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Allen|title=Animals in African Art: From the Familiar to the Marvelous|year=1995|publisher=Prestel for the Museum for African Art|location=Munich}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paths of Luba migration and significant events and relationships are indicated by lines and clusters of beads. Chiefs and their counselors, sacred enclosures, and defined places are shown by circles of beads.&lt;ref name="Roberts and Roberts 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Mary Nooter|author2=Allen F. Roberts |title=Memory: Luba Art and the Making of History|journal=African Arts|date=Winter 1996|volume=29|issue=1|publisher=UCLA James S. Coleman African Studies Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mbudye==
Mbudye is a council of men and women charged with sustaining and interpreting the political and historical principles of the Luba state. As authorities on the tenets of Luba society, Mbudye provide a counterbalance to the power of kings and chiefs, checking or reinforcing it as necessary. Members of Mbudye proceed through a series of stages within the society as they master successive levels of arcane knowledge. Only those at the apex of the association can decipher and interpret the ''lukasa's'' intricate designs and motifs. Mbudye members call the twin projections sprouting along the board's outer edge the "head" and "tail" of the ''lukasa'', zoomorphic elements that are meant to evoke the crocodile. An animal equally at home on land and in water, the crocodile's dual nature is suggestive of Luba political organization, whose existence relies on the interdependence of the kikungulu (the head of the Mbudye) and the kaloba (the "owner of the land," or chief).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memory Board (Lukasa) [Democratic Republic of Congo; Luba] (1977.467.3)|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1977.467.3|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Lukasa==
The ''lukasa'' fulfilled many mnemonic functions, for it could be interpreted in a number of ways, and while all memory boards shared certain common information, particular types of memory boards communicated specialized data. There were three distinct categories of lukasa, each emphasizing a certain kind of knowledge. First, the ''lukasa Iwa nkunda'', "the long hand of the pigeon," bears information on mythical heroes and early rulers and on the mythical migration routes of the Luba. Second, the ''lukasa Iwa kabemba'', "the long hand of the hawk," is concerned with the organization of the Mbudye society. A third type of memory board was created for the use of individual Luba rulers and contained secret information about divine chiefship. No examples of this type, referred to as the ''lukasa Iwa kitenta'', "the long hand of the sacred pool,"' still exist.&lt;ref name="Reefe 1978" /&gt;

which intends to construct statues of [[Maitreya]] [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] in India and perhaps elsewhere. Initial plans were for a 152-metre (500&amp;nbsp;ft) colossal statue, to be built in either [[Kushinagar]] or [[Bodhgaya]]. These plans have since changed, and the Maitreya Project now intends to construct relatively modest statues in both towns. The project was initiated by the [[Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition]], an organisation within the [[Gelug]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

==Laying of the foundation stone in Kushinagar==

[[File:Maitreya Project display.jpg|thumb|right|Maitreya Project Relic Roadshow.]]

On Friday 13 December 2013 the State Government of Uttar Pradesh handed over approximately {{convert|275|acre|ha|lk=on}} of land for the site of the Maitreya Project in Kushinagar. The land is immediately adjacent to the [[Kushinagar#Parinirvana Temple|Parinirvana Temple]] denoting the place where Buddha Shakyamuni passed into [[Parinirvana]], and the Rambhar Stupa which marks the holy site of Buddha’s cremation.

On that same day, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, [[Akhilesh Yadav]], presided over a foundation stone laying ceremony on this land. Maitreya Project's Spiritual Director, [[Thubten Zopa Rinpoche|Lama Zopa Rinpoche]] and the Board of Trustees of the Maitreya Project Trust attended as state guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mandala.fpmt.org/2013/laying-the-foundation-stone-on-maitreya-project-land/|publisher=FPMT|accessdate=29 December 2014|title=Laying the Foundation Stone on Maitreya Project Land}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fpmt.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/12/maitreya-project-kushinagar-news/MP-Kushinagar-Dec-13-2013.pdf|publisher=FPMT|accessdate=29 December 2014|title=Announcement Maitreya Project Kushinagar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''MexiCali Biennial''' is a contemporary visual arts organization which focuses on the border between California and Mexico as a region of aesthetic production. The organization is migratory in nature and showcases exhibitions on both sides of the border. The MexiCali Biennial was originally started as a project critiquing the proliferation of international and regional art [[biennials]] and as a result may be shown at any time and at any location. The inaugural exhibition was in 2006 and subsequent programming occurred in the years spanning 2009 through 2010 and again in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hernandez|first1=Luis|title=The MexiCali Biennial: A Binational Art Project|url=http://beyondbordersnews.com/2016/04/17/the-mexicali-biennial-a-binational-art-project/|website=Beyond Borders Gazette|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The MexiCali Biennial was conceived in 2006 by artists Ed Gomez and Luis G. Hernandez.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knight|first1=Christopher|title=Art review: At MexiCali Biennial, cannibalism is consuming theme|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/28/entertainment/la-et-cm-0129-mexicali-biennial-review-20130129|website=LATimes.com|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curator Pilar Tompkins-Rivas was a founding member and curator of the inaugural exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pilar Tompkins:Mentors|url=http://btwconnect.com/pilar-tompkins-rivas|website=BTWConnect}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 round of programming first took place at La Casa de la Tia Tina, an artist-run space on the border town of [[Mexicali]], MX before traveling to Chavez Studios in East Los Angeles. Due to the nature of the biennial's programming, the second biennial didn't occur until 2009 through 2010, during which time it took place in four different locations in both Mexico and California. Dr. Amy Pederson Converse joined the board and served as co-curator for the 2009-2013 programming. Pederson Converse was instrumental in conceptualizing the theme for the third MexiCali Biennial, which was cannibalism, specifically in regard to philosopher {{ill|Cătălin Avramescu|ro|Cătălin Avramescu}}'s studies of cultural [[cannibalism]] and its relationship to [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vikram|first1=Anuradha|title=The Art of Anthropophagy|url=http://x-traonline.org/article/the-art-of-anthropophagy/|website=X-Tra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== MexiCali Biennial 2013: Cannibalism in the New World ==
The 2013 programming was the first time that an official theme was conceived for the exhibitions. The theme of Cannibalism was influenced by philosopher Catalin Avramescu's research on the cannibal throughout history, in particular its place in colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knight|first1=Christopher|title=Art review: At MexiCali Biennial, cannibalism is consuming theme|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/28/entertainment/la-et-cm-0129-mexicali-biennial-review-20130129|website=latimes|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rabe|first1=John|title=Feast on the MexiCali Biennial at Vincent Price Art Museum.

[[File:Thrown, Combed tea bowl by Shoji Hamada (YORYM-2004.1.1957).JPG|thumb|Thrown, combed tea bowl by [[Shōji Hamada]]]]

{{nihongo|'''''Mingei'''''|民芸||"folk arts" or "arts of the people"}}, the [[Japan]]ese [[folk art]] movement, was developed in the late 1920s and 1930s in Japan. Its founding father was [[Yanagi Sōetsu]] (1889–1961).

==Origins==
In 1916, Yanagi made his first trip to [[Korea]] out of a curiosity for Korean crafts. The trip led to the establishment of the Korean Folk Crafts Museum in 1924, and the coining of the term ''mingei'' by Yanagi, potters [[Hamada Shōji]] (1894–1978) and [[Kawai Kanjirō]] (1890–1966). In 1926, the [[Folk Art]] Movement was formally declared by Yanagi Sōetsu. Yanagi rescued lowly pots used by commoners in the [[Edo]] and [[Meiji period]] that were disappearing in rapidly urbanizing Japan. In 1936, the Japanese Folk Crafts Museum was established.

==Theory==
The philosophical pillar of ''mingei'' is "hand-crafted art of ordinary people" ({{nihongo|民衆的な工芸|minshū-teki-na kōgei}}). Yanagi Sōetsu discovered beauty in everyday ordinary and utilitarian objects created by nameless and unknown craftsmen. According to Yanagi, utilitarian objects made by the common people are "beyond beauty and ugliness". Below are a few criteria of ''mingei'' art and crafts:

*made by anonymous crafts people
*produced by hand in quantity
*inexpensive
*used by the masses
*functional in daily life
*representative of the regions in which they were produced.

Yanagi's book ''The Unknown Craftsman'' has become an influential work since its first release in English in 1972. Yanagi's book examines the Japanese way of viewing and appreciating art and beauty in everyday crafts, including [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]], [[lacquer]], [[textiles]], and [[woodwork]].

==Criticisms of Theory and Orientalism==
[[File:Thrown Bowl by Bernard Leach (YORYM-2004.1.166).JPG|thumb|Thrown bowl by [[Bernard Leach]]]]
In recent decades, scholars such as Yuko Kikuchi and Brian Moeran have claimed they have uncovered power relations and [[ultra-nationalism]] that lie at the core of the formation of ''mingei'' theory. In 1927, Yanagi put forward the "criterion of beauty in Japan" ({{lang|ja|日本における美の標準}} ''{{transl|ja|nihon ni okeru bi no hyōjun}}'') in ''The Way of Crafts'' ({{lang|ja|工芸の道}} ''{{transl|ja|kōgei no michi}}''). During the years of rising [[militarism]] in Japan, Sōetsu Yanagi extended his application of the "criterion of beauty" to the crafts of the [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawans]] and the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] in the Japanese peripheries, and to those of the [[Japanese colonies|colonies]] including [[Korea]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Manchuria]]. These scholars argue that ''mingei'' theory, far from being an [[Oriental]] theory, is a "hybridization" and "appropriation" of [[Europe|Occidental]] ideas such as that of [[William Morris]] (1834–1896)&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/discussionpapers/2008/Nakanishi.html Wendy Jones Nakanishi, "The Anxiety of Influence: Ambivalent Relations Between Japan's 'Mingei' and Britain's 'Arts and Crafts' Movements", Electronic Journal of Japanese Studies, 28 October 2008'']&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Bernard Leach]] (1887–1979) introduced when he lived and worked in Japan from 1909 to 1920.&lt;ref name="xviii"&gt;{{Citation

Yūko Kikuchi terms this phenomenon "Oriental Orientalism".

Yanagi’s ''Korea and its Art'' was severely criticized by Korean intellectuals as a "colonialist view of history" in 1974. Yanagi defined "beauty of sadness" ({{lang|ja|悲哀の美}} ''{{transl|ja|hiai no bi}}'') as the "innate, original beauty created by the Korean race" ({{lang|ja|民族の固有の美}} ''{{transl|ja|minzoku no koyū no bi}}''). Yanagi believed that the long history of foreign invasions of Korea was reflected in Korean art, and especially in its [[pottery]], in the "sad and lonely" lines. Such a theory has been criticized by Korean scholars as the "aesthetic of [[colonialism]]".

{{no footnotes|date=June 2014}}
{{Nihongo|'''''Monogatari'''''|物語||}} is a [[Genre|literary form]] in traditional [[Japanese literature]], an extended prose [[narrative]] tale comparable to the [[epic poetry|epic]]. Monogatari is closely tied to aspects of the [[oral tradition]], and almost always relates a [[fiction]]al or fictionalized story, even when retelling a historical event. Many of the great works of Japanese fiction, such as the ''[[Genji monogatari]]'' and the ''[[Heike monogatari]]'', are in this ''monogatari'' form.

The form was prominent around the 9th to 15th centuries, reaching a peak between the 10th and 11th centuries. According to the ''[[Fūyō Wakashū]]'' (1271), at least 198 ''monogatari'' existed by the 13th century. Of these, around forty still exist.

==Influence==
When European and other foreign literature later became known to Japan, the word "monogatari" began to be used in Japanese titles of foreign works of a similar nature. For example, ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' is known as ''Nito Monogatari'' ({{lang|ja|二都物語}}), ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' as ''Sen'ichiya Monogatari'' ({{lang|ja|千一夜物語}}) and more recently ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as ''Yubiwa Monogatari'' ({{lang|ja|指輪物語}}) and ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' as ''Arabama Monogatari'' ({{lang|ja|アラバマ物語}}).

His wife and occasional coauthor, Elizabeth Lane Beardsley, was also a philosopher at Temple.

His work in [[aesthetics]] is best known for its championing of the [[instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] theory of art and the concept of aesthetic experience. Beardsley was elected president of the American Society for Aesthetics in 1956. He also wrote an introductory text on aesthetics and edited a well-regarded survey anthology of philosophy.

Among [[Literary criticism|literary critics]], Beardsley is known for two essays written with [[William Kurtz Wimsatt, Jr.|W.K. Wimsatt]], "The [[Intentional Fallacy]]" and "The Affective Fallacy," both key texts of [[New Criticism]].  His works also include: ''Practical Logic'' (1950), ''Aesthetics'' (1958), and ''Aesthetics: A Short History'' (1966). He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=May 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Newgrounds''' (collectively '''Newgrounds.com, Inc.''') is an American online entertainment and [[social media]] website and company. It hosts user-generated content such as gaming, filming, audio and artwork composition in four respective website categories. While [[AOL]] and [[Geocities]] had [[Static hosting|statically hosted]] user-generated content, Newgrounds provided visitor-driven voting and ranking of user-generated animations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@SeanBuckelew/newgrounds-64831b97a5a8|title=Newgrounds: Everything by Everyone|last=Buckelew|first=Sean|date=2014-12-27|website=Sean Buckelew|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The site's founder and owner, Thomas "Tom" Fulp, founded the site and company in 1995 and produces in-house content over at the headquarters and offices, based in the [[Glenside, Pennsylvania|Glenside]] neighborhood of [[Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania|Cheltenham Township]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cheltenhamtownship.org/businessdirectory/business_dir.htm#N|title=Cheltenham Township Business Directory|date=January 2007|accessdate=2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout &amp; Overview==
===Content &amp; General===
[[User-generated content]] can be uploaded and categorized into either one of the site’s four web portals: ''Games'', ''Movies'', ''Audio'', and ''Art''. A submission entered undergoes the process termed the ''Blam-And-Protect'' system, where it can be critiqued and rated from other users (up to 5 stars) or reviewed by users. Total scores succeeding judgement determine if whether the content will "saved"(added onto the database) or "blammed"(deleted but still saved as per ''Obituaries'' section). 

Art and audio composition is categorized in a relatively different method called "Scouting". Alike the ''Blam-And-Protect'' system, it filters out stolen content, spam, or prohibited material online via users and site moderators (referred as "Mods"). When an individual is scouted, its submitted property becomes virtually visible to everyone else, and then given the privilege to also scout authors.

Submissions are organized in the general "Portal", where it accompanies the genres into a single place to view authored material. It also stores throwback content in earlier years, statuses of judged submissions, and current and past daily winners on display.

Content and context are liable to be reported for review to the Mods and staff members by flagging it for plausible violations to the site's guidelines, if regarded by multiple users. The homepage of Newgrounds includes featured submissions from each category, as well online awards and honors to users whose submission that fall under the site’s requirements to earn it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.retrojunk.com/community/post/index/45064|title=The History Of Newgrounds {{!}} Retro Junk|website=www.retrojunk.com|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult-oriented content is general in nature of the site, but restricted only to users ages 18 and up though no safeguard is subject to assure this. 

Online competitions and contests are open at some times, where an individual can win and receive prizes presented by either a recognized user or staff member upon following a given theme.

===User communication &amp; Behavior===
The site includes a ''Community'' portal, where users can be able to communicate with others through various [[Internet forum]]s. Such forums can be locked if it is in violation. Another communication system developed on the site, termed "Private Messaging" and abbreviated as PM, is also granted, similar to the service of [[email]] where users can send messages via other users. A live [[chat room]] is also available.

==History==

===1990s - Organization===

In 1991, at the age 13, Tom Fulp launched a [[Neo Geo]] fanzine under the name "New Ground" sending issues to approximately 100 members of a club originating on the internet in [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newgrounds.com/wiki/about-newgrounds/history#wiki_toc_1|title=1991: The Zine|website=newgrounds.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fulp launched a website as ''New Ground Remix'' using a hosting service, increasing popularity in the summer of 1996 after BBS games ''Club a Seal''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gimletmedia.com/episode/episode105-how-we-first-met/|title=#105 At World's End - Reply All by Gimlet Media|website=gimletmedia.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Assassin'' were created by Fulp while a student at [[Drexel University]], Pennsylvania. Fulp created the sequels to his creations, as games Club a Seal II and Assassin II," along with the decision to develop a separate hosting site, titled as ''New Ground Atomix''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newgrounds.com/wiki/about-newgrounds/history#wiki_toc_4|title=1997: The Tale of Two Newgrounds|website=newgrounds.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulp began experimenting with Macromedia Flash, along with programming a Flash-compatible homepage that was later introduced to his secondary site, "Telebubby Fun Land", and was later released. Fulp later merged his two websites to form another website with the name ''Newgrounds'', leading to him to change hosts to accommodate the increasing traffic, and started selling merchandise to pay for the website's hosting bills. Introducing banner ads to pay for growing payments in 1999, Fulp partnered with [[Troma Entertainment|Troma]], who hosted the site in exchange for a share of ad revenue. A chat room and message board was added onto the website, which allowed people visiting the website to interact with each other. Many users had begun submitting their own Flash creations to Fulp, in which he decided in a portion of the site called "The Portal." A friend of Fulp named Ross developed the “Grounds Gold System”, which allowed users to gain points for visiting the site and voting submissions online. Ad revenue had increased, so Ross was hired, starting development of an current automated Portal, which would allow users to submit their own generated content to the website.

===2000s - Developments===

After the [[dot-com bubble]] collapsed, Newgrounds struggled in paying its hosting costs. The affiliation with Troma ended in 2003 and Newgrounds switched to another bandwidth provider, which significantly reduced hosting costs. 2004 saw Newgrounds recovering from the online market crash, and the [[Numa Numa Dance]] viral phenomenon made its debut on Newgrounds near the end of the year, and became one of the first viral videos on the internet. Medals, the equivalent of in-game [[achievement (video gaming)|achievements]], were introduced for the first time through the API software in 2009, soon followed by a "Sharing" component that would allow content to be distributed within games, such as custom level designs. The Art Portal in its complete form was launched in June of the same year, along with the renovation of the company’s headquarters.

===2010s - Improvements===

In 2011, the Newgrounds Annual Tournament of Animation (NATA) began as a 4–6 month long animation competition on Newgrounds sponsored by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]. In 2012, Newgrounds published their first mobile game, titled ''GroundCats'', on [[iOS]]. That same year, major changes to the website included the launch of the video player, allowing users to publish movies that were not in .SWF format for the first time, and support for HTML5-coded games, which meant users were no longer limited to submitting movies and games made in Flash. In 2013, the site suffered heavily through financial issues and closed down its online market following the year after. Platform mobile game ''[[Geometry Dash]]'' developed by RobTop Games allowed songs from Newgrounds to be used in levels made with the level editor with the release of its 1.9 update in 2014. The Audio Portal consisted of submitted copyrighted songs for use in the game, leading to [[Nightcore]], along with [[Mashup (music)|mashups]], banned as a result.

An similar issue of copyrighted concurred in 2016, when the site began receiving complaints that old content and files contained unlicensed commercial music and images, resulting in several submissions being removed by moderators and staff. In 2018, new servers and video-encoding-software were unveiled, along with developments for the site to be ad-free, and improve page performance.

== Biography ==

Nikolai Efimovich Timkov was born August 12, 1912, at a settlement of Nakhichevanskaya Dacha close to [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Russian Empire]]. His parents, Efim Yegorovich Timkov and Vasilisa Timofeevna Ablyazova were peasants from the Saratov province. In 1892, they moved to Rostov-on-Don. A father worked as a general worker. The family had four older children. Parents died in 1924, when Nikolai was twelve years old. Care of him took the older sisters.

In 1927, Nikolai Timkov finished 8 grades of secondary school and enrolled in the Rostov Art College, which was headed by A. Chinenov, who was landscape painter, a pupil of [[Vasily Polenov]] and a big fan of [[Isaac Levitan]]. In 1930, Timkov graduated from Art College. In 1931, he went to Moscow, where he met with Pavel Radimov and other Moscow artists of [[AKhRR|AKhR Association]] (Association of Artists of the Revolution).

Timkov worked in "Izogiz" edition as a general worker, then enrolled at the Association "Vsekohudozhnik" as an artist-designer. At the same time he taught himself at the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] and did lots of plein air painting, using from time to time the benevolent advice of [[Mikhail Nesterov]] and [[Sergey Malyutin]]. At Radimov's apartment he met  [[Isaak Brodsky]], who played a big role in the fate of the artist. After seeing his work, Brodsky advised Nikolai Timkov to go to Leningrad to continue his art education.

In 1933 Nikolai Timkov together with [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Laktionov|Alexander Laktionov]] arrived in Leningrad and entered the painting department of the [[Repin Institute of Arts|Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]] of the All-Russian Academy of Arts. He studied with Mikhail Bernshtein, [[Arcady Rylov]], [[Alexander Lubimov]], and Vladimir Serov. In 1939 Nikolai Timkov graduated from the [[Repin Institute of Arts|Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]] in Isaak Brodsky workshop with the rank of artist of painting. His degree work was a painting titled ''The Day off in suburb''.&lt;ref&gt;''Anniversary Directory graduates of Saint Petersburg State Academic Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture named after Ilya Repin, Russian Academy of Arts. 1915 - 2005''.

His first part in Art exhibition refers to 1929 (Rostov on Don). In 1947, in the halls of the [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists|Leningrad Union of Soviet Artists]] has been opened the first solo exhibition of his works, as shown later in Leningrad at the Cinema House and the House of Arts. He painted landscapes, genre paintings, worked in watercolors and oil painting. Most famous as master of lyrical landscapes. Since the late 1940s, Nikolai Timkov become the constant participant of Leningrad, Republican, and All-Union Art Exhibitions, including [[All-Union art exhibition (Moscow, 1957)|All-Union Art Exhibition of 1957 in Moscow]], devoted to the 40th Anniversary of the October Revolution. Formation of his individual creative style proceeded gradually, as experience and lessons learned in the process of communicating with your colleagues and numerous creative travel to the Volga River and Don River, in Staraya Ladoga, the Urals, the work in Wira and Christmas village near Leningrad, on the Academicheskaya Dacha. Already as a mature master he visits Italy (1969), England (1974), France (1977), Yugoslavia (1981).

In the first post World War II decade, Timkov style developed and improved in areas identified during the years of study. He was entirely under the influence of the 19th-century Russian landscape painters. Real space in his works passed almost illusory precision, the colors muted. In landscapes of Don and Volga he tends to cover a larger space with the image of the set clearly legible plans that is in line with general trends in the genre of these years. Among the famous works of this period were painting ''Harvest'' (1950),&lt;ref&gt;[[Spring exhibition (Leningrad, 1954)|''Spring Exhibition of works by Leningrad artists of 1954.

But the sketch in those years was considered only as auxiliary material for landscape painting, with its large size, an essential genre-narrative beginning with the careful selection and meticulous attention to detail and alignment of the composition. Not surprisingly, therefore, that at the solo exhibition of 1957 in the Leningrad Union of Artists, as later in Rostov on Don, Timkov appears as a gifted and serious professional, whose work is however still does not go beyond the tenets and practices that existed in the Soviet landscape painting of 1940-1950s.

However, much in his works has already drawn attention to themselves. This is a rare natural sense of color, sincere and resolute own voice in the selection of topics and reveal of the way. His painting becomes decorative, pattern and shapes becomes more generalized. The artist often resorted to building tracks around the large volumes and planes.

Timkov not stop the quest for his identity until the last years of life, and are critical to the deal has been painted by him earlier. And yet his recognizable style artist gets to mid-1960s. This assures attentive acquaintance with the works of this period, shown in solo exhibitions of 1964 in Leningrad, Moscow, Yaroslavl, Krasnodar, Stavropol, Kislovodsk, Rostov-on-Don, Ordzhonikidze, Nalchik, and in 1975 in Leningrad. They traced the obvious development of the creative artist's manner from traditional plein air painting aside impressionistic enrichment and refinement of color, enhance decoration, styling and some conventions of the drawing.

Colourful range of his works in 1960 become extremely broad, its coloring a ringing and decorative, but not local, and subtly linked to relief, with the expressive possibilities of the canvas surface, texture, smear. In this period the spectacular talent of Nikolai Timkov fully disclosed in all kinds of creativity - from large landscape painting to nature studies of small forms. Among them paintings ''A First Snow''&lt;ref&gt;[[Exhibition of Leningrad artists (1961)|''Exhibition of works by Leningrad artists of 1961.

His last lifetime exhibition has been shown in 1993 in the halls of [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists]].''
 
Nikolai Efimovich Timkov died on December 25, 1993 in Saint Petersburg at the eighty-second year of life. His paintings reside in [[Russian Museum|State Russian Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;''Time for change. The Art of 1960-1985 in the Soviet Union''. - Saint Petersburg: State Russian Museum, 2006. - p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; in Art museums and private collections in Russia,&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei V. Ivanov.

Soviet Impressionism.'' Woodbridge, England, Antique Collectors' Club, 2001. P.29,47.&lt;/ref&gt; and throughout the world.

In 1990s, after the death of the artist, his work has received recognition and aroused great interest abroad. He devoted two monographs published in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;''The Seasons of Timkov. Master Russian Impressionist''. The Pushkin Collection, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Akademichka. The Academic Dacha through the eyes of Nikolai Timkov''. The Pushkin Group and the Timkov Collection, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibitions of his works were held in San Francisco (1998, 2000, 2001), Aspen (1999), New York (1999, 2001), Scottsdale (2000), Palm Beach (2000), Vail (2001), Washington (2001) and other cities. This brought the artist fame and glory of the "Russian Impressionist". One of the first Soviet artists, and perhaps the first landscape painter, he was listed in the West as one of the biggest painter of the 20th century. With the works of Nikolai Timkov for many Western art historians and art lovers began essentially a new discovery of Soviet-era art middle and second half of the 20th century.

'''''Odd and the Frost Giants''''' ([[2008 in literature|2008]]) is a [[World Book Day]] book by [[Neil Gaiman]]. It draws on [[Norse mythology]] and also the historical [[Viking]]s.

== Plot summary ==
Odd is a young Norseman whose father, a woodcutter, drowned during a Viking raid. His Scottish mother marries a fat widower who neglects him in favor of his own children, and when soon after the winter drags on unnaturally long, Odd leaves his village for the forest. There he meets a fox, an eagle and a bear, the latter with its paw trapped in a tree. Odd aids the bear, and learns that these are not normal animals, but the gods [[Loki]], [[Odin]] and [[Thor]]. The gods have been transformed and cast out of [[Asgard]] by a [[Jötunn|Frost Giant]] who tricked Loki into giving him [[Mjolnir|Thor's hammer]] by taking the form of a woman, granting him rule over Asgard and causing the endless winter.

Deciding to help the stranded gods, Odd travels with them to Asgard. There, Thor leads him to [[Mimir's Well]], and he receives wisdom and a vision of his parents in their youth. He eventually speaks with the Giant, who reveals his brother built the walls of Asgard but was tricked out of payment and killed by Thor. Odd convinces the Giant to return home. In return, the goddess [[Freyja/Freya]] heals his leg, though she cannot mend it completely, and Odin gives him a staff. He returns to [[Midgard]], somewhat bigger than when he left due to drinking from Mimir's Well, and as the winter ends he reunites with his mother.

'''''Saint Catherine of Alexandria''''' is a [[painting]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]]. In the painting, [[Catherine of Alexandria]] is looking upward in ecstasy and leaning on a wheel - an allusion to the [[breaking wheel]] (or Catherine wheel) of her martyrdom.&lt;ref&gt;Capgrave, John, and Karen A. Winstead. 2011. ''The life of Saint Katherine of Alexandria.'' Notre Dame, Ind: University of Notre Dame Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was painted c. 1507, towards the end of Raphael's sojourn in Florence and shows the young artist in a transitional phase. The depiction of religious passion in the painting is still reminiscent of [[Pietro Perugino]]. But the graceful [[contrapposto]] of Catherine's pose is typical of the influence of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] on Raphael, and is believed to be an echo of Leonardo's lost painting ''[[Leda and the Swan]]''.

==Painting materials==
Raphael employed the usual [[Renaissance]] [[pigments]] such as natural [[ultramarine]], [[madder lake]], [[ochres]] and [[lead-tin-yellow|lead-tin yellow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/raphael-saint-catherine-alexandria/ Raphael, Saint Catherine of Alexandria], ColourLex&lt;/ref&gt; He also mixed a special kind of finely powdered glass into several pigments to speed up the drying of the oil paints.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, A., Spring, M., Plazzotta, C. ‘Raphael’s Early Work in the National Gallery: Paintings before Rome‘. National Gallery Technical Bulletin Vol 25, pp 4–35&lt;/ref&gt;

This picture was partially used on the cover of [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] album ''[[Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness]]''.

'''''Salutat''''' is an 1898 painting by [[Thomas Eakins]] (1844–1916). Based on a real-life boxing match that occurred in 1898, the work depicts a boxer waving to the crowd after the match. According to Eakins' biographer [[Lloyd Goodrich]], ''Salutat'' is "one of Eakins' finest achievements in figure-painting."&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Volume II, pp. 151-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting's title is [[Latin]] for "He greets" or "He salutes."

==Background==
Much as he had with his paintings of rowers in the 1870s, during the late 1890s Eakins turned his interest again to the male nude, this time depicting prizefighters. Eakins attended fights in 1898, and aided by sportswriters Clarence Cranmer and Henry Walter Schlichter, met with and hired fighters to pose for him.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Volume II, pp. 144-5.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Turkey Point Billy Smith.jpeg|left|thumbnail|A postcard of Billy Smith, circa 1900]]
The studio became a place to spar; according to Eakins's protégé the sculptor [[Samuel Murray]], (who in 1899 made a bronze statue of Billy Smith)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsantiques101.com/MurrayBSmith/001_big.jpg Samuel Murray's 1899 statue of ''Turkey Point Billy Smith,''] retrieved March 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; one of the fighters, Ellwood McCloskey, would "round up fellow pugilists who had promised to pose but didn't show up":&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hey, you son of a bitch, haven't you got a date to pose for Mr. Eakins? Come on now, or I'll punch your goddamn head off."&lt;ref name="Goodrich145"&gt;Goodrich, Volume II, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

"Turkey Point" Billy Smith, a featherweight who competed in over 100 bouts over the course of ten years and fought two featherweight champions, was the protagonist for ''Salutat'' as well as for ''[[Between Rounds]]''.&lt;ref name="Goodrich145"/&gt;





&lt;!--deliberate extra space because of images - please retain--&gt;
==Studies==
Eakins made multiple studies of the subject. A pencil-on-paper study was purchased by [[Joseph Hirshhorn]] in 1965 and donated to [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden|his eponymous museum]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110604201930/http://hirshhorn.si.edu/visit/collection_object.asp?key=32&amp;subkey=6357 Thomas Eakins - Study for "Salutat".] Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. Retrieved March 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

Eakins also completed an oil-on-canvas study, which he gave to art critic [[Sadakichi Hartmann]] after Hartmann praised Eakins in his 1901 book ''A History of American Art''. (This was the first time Eakins had been recognized as being of historic importance.)&lt;ref&gt;Adams, 358&lt;/ref&gt; This study is now in the possession of the [[Carnegie Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!229849!0 Study for "Salutat", (painting).] Art Inventories Catalog, Smithsonian American Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmoa.org/searchcollections/details.aspx?item=1021940 Thomas Eakins: Study for Salutat]. Carnegie Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
''Salutat'', ''Between Rounds'' (a portion of which was executed separately as ''[[Billy Smith (painting)|Billy Smith]]'') and ''[[Taking the Count]]'' are a series of three large boxing paintings done by Eakins. The former two depict events surrounding a boxing match that took place on April 22, 1898.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wichitaartmuseum.org/acm/detail.php?action=v&amp;id=1237583225304978 Billy Smith, 1898]. Wichita Art Museum&lt;/ref&gt; [[Featherweight]] Tim Callahan fought featherweight Billy Smith in a match that was close until the final round, when Callahan gained the advantage and won the fight. However, for ''Salutat'', Eakins chose to depict Smith as the winner.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, 444&lt;/ref&gt; In the work, Smith raises his hand to salute the audience, in the style of a [[Gladiator]]. On the painting's original frame Eakins carved the words "DEXTRA VICTRICE CONCLAMANTES SALVTAT" (With the victorious right hand, he salutes those shouting [their approval]).&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Volume II, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As with a number of other Eakins works, the rendering of the figures is extremely precise, such that it has allowed art historians to identify individual members of the audience. While working on the boxing pictures, friends would visit the studio, and Eakins invited them to "stay a while and I'll put you in the picture."&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Volume II, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Salutat'', audience members include Eakins's friend Louis Kenton (wearing eyeglasses and a bow tie), sportswriter Clarence Cranmer (wearing a bowler hat), David Jordan (brother of Letitia Wilson Jordan, whom Eakins painted in ''[[Portrait of Letitia Wilson Jordan]]''), photographer Louis Husson (next to Jordan), Eakins's student [[Samuel Murray]], and Eakins's father Benjamin Eakins.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, 444-445&lt;/ref&gt; 

Smith is bathed in soft white light, which illuminates his muscles.&lt;ref&gt;Messenger 350, footnote 8&lt;/ref&gt; Amid a general tonality of warm grays and browns that contains no strong chromatic notes, the skin tones of the three main figures are pale.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Volume II, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; All three men have the quality of relief sculpture, and with Smith's figure separate from those of his seconds, they appear to move across the canvas in an arrangement reminiscent of a [[frieze]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Volume II, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition and provenance==
Eakins sent the painting to the Annual of the [[Pennsylvania Academy]] in January 1899,&lt;ref&gt;Sewell, Darrel; et al. ''Thomas Eakins'' ''The 1890s'' Marc Simpson, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; and although it "failed to please the few critics who noticed it", he exhibited the picture a total of four times in the next five years.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Volume II, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting remained unsold during Eakins's lifetime, and was bought from his widow by [[Thomas Cochran (banker)|Thomas Cochran]] in 1929; he subsequently donated the picture to the [[Addison Gallery of American Art]] at [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Volume II, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saraakallio rock paintings''' ({{lang-fi|Saraakallion kalliomaalaukset}}) are situated in [[Central Finland]]. The rock site lies on the eastern shore of Lake [[Saraavesi]], opposite the village center of [[Laukaa]]. The rocky cliff of Saraakallio is an impressive landmark rising on the shore of the lake. An important water route [[Keitele Canal]] runs in front of the paintings.&lt;ref name=lahelma&gt;{{cite web|title= A Touch of Red : Archaeological and Ethnographic Approaches to Interpreting Finnish Rock Paintings |author= Antti Lahelma |url=https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/19406/atoucho.pdf |pages= 14, 195–199 |publisher= The Finnish Antiquarian Society |publication-date= 2008|accessdate=22 Feb 2014}}{{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two art areas, Saraakallio I and Saraakallio II. It is difficult to count and list all the paintings of Saraakallio, partly because they are so many and varied, partly because many of them are blurred, fragmentary or have been painted over. The amount of pictures is between 50–200, and therefore it is the biggest rock art area in Finland.

'''''Survival of the Fattest''''' is a sculpture of a small starved boy, carrying a fat woman, the sculpture was made by [[Jens Galschiøt]], and Lars Calmar, in 2002, as a symbol of the imbalanced distribution of the world’s resources.

[[File:Survival_of_the_fattest.jpg|thumb|The sculpture in China 2005]]

== Sculpture and symbols ==
The 3.5 metre tall bronze sculpture was made in 2002 and depicts a huge fat woman from the west, sitting on the shoulders of a starved African boy. The woman is holding a pair of scales as a symbol of justice, but her eyes are closed to show that justice is degenerating into self-righteousness and unwillingness to see the obvious injustice.

The sculpture intended to send out a message to the rich part of the world, and seems to create focus on our obesity due to over consumption while people in the third world are dying of hunger. Due to the imbalanced distribution of the resources in the world, the most people in the western countries are living comfortably, they are oppressing the poor people by means of an unjust world trade. The rich countries are by means of tariff barriers and subsidies keeping the poor countries out of the markets of the West.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aidoh.dk/new-struct/About-Jens-Galschiot/CV.pdf the official CV of Jens Galschiot&lt;/ref&gt;

On the sculpture there is an inscription, which states: "I'm sitting on the back of a man. He is sinking under the burden. I would do anything to help him. Except stepping down from his back."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://reason.com/archives/2010/02/12/reading-a-sculpture|title=Reading a Sculpture|date=2010-02-12|work=Reason.com|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Exhibition at COP15 ==
In 2009 at the 15th Climate Change Conference ([[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP15]]), Jens Galschiot exhibited a series of sculptures titled [[SevenMeters]], in which ''Survival of the Fattest'' perhaps was the most poignant sculpture.

''Survival of the Fattest'' was placed in the harbour of Copenhagen, next to the internationally famous statue, ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]''. Based on a fairy tale by the Danish fairy tale writer [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' is a national monument and seen by an estimated 1 million tourists a year.

By placing his sculpture in the water [http://www.google.dk/search?q=%22The+Little+Mermaid%22+%22survival+of+the+Fattest%22&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:da:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=da&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=fkYpT5XlNsfe4QTgtZC-Aw&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=629&amp;sei=iUYpT5vDOsz34QTasuDZAw next to ''The Little Mermaid''], Galschiot was assured that its explosive message would receive international attention. The act also highlighted that the goals and objectives of the wealthy nations at the [[Climate Change]] Conference to be nothing more than fairy tales.&lt;ref&gt;http://art-for-a-change.com/blog/2009/12/cop15-survival-of-the-fattest.html an article from art-for-a-change.com&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Group theory sidebar |Finite}}

In [[abstract algebra]], the '''symmetric group''' defined over any [[set (mathematics)|set]] is the [[group (mathematics)|group]] whose [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] are all the [[bijection]]s from the set to itself, and whose [[group operation]] is the [[function composition|composition of functions]].  In particular, the finite symmetric group '''S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''' defined over a [[finite set]] of ''n'' symbols consists of the [[permutation]] operations that can be performed on the ''n'' symbols.&lt;ref name=Jacobson-def&gt;Jacobson (2009), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Since there are ''n''! (''n'' [[factorial]]) possible permutation operations that can be performed on a [[tuple]] composed of ''n'' symbols, it follows that the number of elements (the [[Order (group theory)|order]]) of the symmetric group S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is ''n''!.

Although symmetric groups can be defined on infinite sets, this article focuses on the finite symmetric groups: their applications, their elements, their [[conjugacy class]]es, a [[finitely presented group|finite presentation]], their [[subgroup]]s, their automorphism groups, and their [[group representation |representation]] theory. For the remainder of this article, "symmetric group" will mean a symmetric group on a finite set.

The symmetric group is important to diverse areas of mathematics such as [[Galois theory]], [[invariant theory]], the [[representation theory of Lie groups]], and [[combinatorics]]. [[Cayley's theorem]] states that every group ''G'' is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a [[subgroup]] of the symmetric group on ''G''.

== Definition and first properties ==
The symmetric group on a finite set ''X'' is the group whose elements are all bijective functions from ''X'' to ''X'' and whose group operation is that of [[function composition]].&lt;ref name=Jacobson-def /&gt; For finite sets, "permutations" and "bijective functions" refer to the same operation, namely rearrangement. The symmetric group of '''degree''' ''n'' is the symmetric group on the set {{nowrap|1=''X'' = { 1, 2, ..., ''n'' }.}}

The symmetric group on a set ''X'' is denoted in various ways including S&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, 𝔖&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, Σ&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''! and Sym(''X'').&lt;ref name=Jacobson-def /&gt;  If ''X'' is the set {{nowrap|{ 1, 2, ..., ''n'' },}} then the symmetric group on ''X'' is also denoted S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref name=Jacobson-def /&gt; 𝔖&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, Σ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and Sym(''n'').

Symmetric groups on infinite sets behave quite differently from symmetric groups on finite sets, and are discussed in {{harv|Scott|1987|loc=Ch. 11}}, {{harv|Dixon|Mortimer|1996|loc=Ch. 8}}, and {{harv|Cameron|1999}}.

The symmetric group on a set of ''n'' elements has [[order (group theory)|order]] ''n''! (the [[factorial]] of ''n'').&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (2009), p. 32. Theorem 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[abelian group|abelian]] if and only if ''n'' is less than or equal to 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Symmetric Group is not Abelian/Proof 1|url=https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Symmetric_Group_is_not_Abelian/Proof_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 0}} and {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1}} (the [[empty set]] and the [[singleton set]]), the symmetric group is [[trivial group|trivial]] (it has order {{nowrap|1=0! = 1! = 1}}). The group S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[solvable group|solvable]] if and only if {{nowrap|''n'' ≤ 4}}. This is an essential part of the proof of the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]] that shows that for every {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 4}} there are [[polynomial]]s of degree ''n'' which are not solvable by radicals, that is, the solutions cannot be expressed by performing a finite number of operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and root extraction on the polynomial's coefficients.

== Applications ==
The symmetric group on a set of size ''n'' is the [[Galois group]] of the general [[polynomial]] of degree ''n'' and plays an important role in [[Galois theory]].  In [[invariant theory]], the symmetric group acts on the variables of a multi-variate function, and the functions left invariant are the so-called [[symmetric function]]s.  In the [[representation theory of Lie groups]], the [[representation theory of the symmetric group]] plays a fundamental role through the ideas of [[Schur functor]]s.  In the theory of [[Coxeter group]]s, the symmetric group is the Coxeter group of type A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and occurs as the [[Weyl group]] of the [[general linear group]].  In [[combinatorics]], the symmetric groups, their elements ([[permutation]]s), and their [[group representation|representations]] provide a rich source of problems involving [[Young tableaux]], [[plactic monoid]]s, and the [[Bruhat order]].  [[Subgroup]]s of symmetric groups are called [[permutation group]]s and are widely studied because of their importance in understanding [[group action]]s, [[homogeneous space]]s, and [[automorphism group]]s of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s, such as the [[Higman–Sims group]] and the [[Higman–Sims graph]].

== Elements ==
The elements of the symmetric group on a set ''X'' are the [[permutation]]s of ''X''.

=== Multiplication ===
The group operation in a symmetric group is [[function composition]], denoted by the symbol ∘ or simply by juxtaposition of the permutations. The composition {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g''}} of permutations ''f'' and ''g'', pronounced "''f'' of ''g''", maps any element ''x'' of ''X'' to ''f''(''g''(''x'')). Concretely, let (see [[permutation]] for an explanation of notation):

: &lt;math&gt; f = (1\ 3)(4\ 5)=\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\ 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 4\end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; g = (1\ 2\ 5)(3\ 4)=\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\ 2 &amp; 5 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Applying ''f'' after ''g'' maps 1 first to 2 and then 2 to itself; 2 to 5 and then to 4; 3 to 4 and then to 5, and so on. So composing ''f'' and ''g'' gives
: &lt;math&gt; fg = f\circ g = (1\ 2\ 4)(3\ 5)=\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp;3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 1 &amp; 3\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

A [[Cyclic permutation|cycle]] of length {{nowrap|1=''L'' = ''k'' · ''m''}}, taken to the ''k''-th power, will decompose into ''k'' cycles of length ''m'': For example, ({{nowrap|1=''k'' = 2}}, {{nowrap|1=''m'' = 3}}),
: &lt;math&gt; (1~2~3~4~5~6)^2 = (1~3~5) (2~4~6).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Verification of group axioms ===
To check that the symmetric group on a set ''X'' is indeed a [[group (mathematics)|group]], it is necessary to verify the group axioms of closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.&lt;ref&gt;modern algebra Author A. R. Vasishtha, A. K. Vasishtha Publisher Krishna Prakashan Media&lt;/ref&gt;
# The operation of [[function composition]] is closed in the set of permutations of the given set ''X''.
# [[Function composition]] is always associative.
# The trivial bijection that assigns each element of ''X'' to itself serves as an identity for the group.
# Every bijection has an [[inverse function]] that undoes its action, and thus each element of a symmetric group does have an inverse which is a permutation too.

=== Transpositions ===
{{main article|Transposition (mathematics)}}
A '''transposition''' is a permutation which exchanges two elements and keeps all others fixed; for example (1 3) is a transposition. Every permutation can be written as a product of transpositions; for instance, the permutation ''g'' from above can be written as ''g'' = (1 2)(2 5)(3 4). Since ''g'' can be written as a product of an odd number of transpositions, it is then called an [[Even and odd permutations|odd permutation]], whereas ''f'' is an even permutation.

The representation of a permutation as a product of transpositions is not unique; however, the number of transpositions needed to represent a given permutation is either always even or always odd. There are several short proofs of the invariance of this parity of a permutation.

The product of two even permutations is even, the product of two odd permutations is even, and all other products are odd.  Thus we can define the '''sign''' of a permutation:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sgn}f = \begin{cases} +1, &amp; \text{if }f\mbox { is even} \\ -1, &amp; \text{if }f \text{ is odd}. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

With this definition,
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sgn}\colon \mathrm{S}_n \rightarrow \{+1, -1\}\ &lt;/math&gt;
is a [[group homomorphism]] ({+1, –1} is a group under multiplication, where +1 is e, the [[neutral element]]). The [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of this homomorphism, that is, the set of all even permutations, is called the '''[[alternating group]]''' A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a [[normal subgroup]] of S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 2}} it has {{nowrap|''n''!/2}} elements. The group S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[semidirect product]] of A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and any subgroup generated by a single transposition.

Furthermore, every permutation can be written as a product of ''[[adjacent transposition]]s'', that is, transpositions of the form {{nowrap|(''a'' ''a''+1)}}.  For instance, the permutation ''g'' from above can also be written as {{nowrap|1=''g'' = (4 5)(3 4)(4 5)(1 2)(2 3)(3 4)(4 5)}}. The sorting algorithm [[bubble sort]] is an application of this fact.  The representation of a permutation as a product of adjacent transpositions is also not unique.

=== Cycles ===
A [[cyclic permutation|cycle]] of ''length'' ''k'' is a permutation ''f'' for which there exists an element ''x'' in {1,...,''n''} such that ''x'', ''f''(''x''), ''f''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''), ..., ''f''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') = ''x'' are the only elements moved by ''f''; it is required that {{nowrap|''k'' ≥ 2}} since with {{nowrap|1=''k'' = 1}} the element ''x'' itself would not be moved either. The permutation ''h'' defined by

:&lt;math&gt;h = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\ 4 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 5\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

is a cycle of length three, since {{nowrap|1=''h''(1) = 4}}, {{nowrap|1=''h''(4) = 3}} and {{nowrap|1=''h''(3) = 1}}, leaving 2 and 5 untouched. We denote such a cycle by {{nowrap|(1 4 3)}}, but it could equally well be written {{nowrap|(4 3 1)}} or {{nowrap|(3 1 4)}} by starting at a different point. The order of a cycle is equal to its length. Cycles of length two are transpositions. Two cycles are ''disjoint'' if they move disjoint subsets of elements. Disjoint cycles [[Commutative property|commute]]: for example, in S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; there is the equality {{nowrap|1=(4 1 3)(2 5 6) = (2 5 6)(4 1 3)}}. Every element of S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; can be written as a product of disjoint cycles; this representation is unique [[up to]] the order of the factors, and the freedom present in representing each individual cycle by choosing its starting point.

Cycles admit the following conjugation property with any permutation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, this property is often used to obtain its [[Symmetric group#Generators and relations|Generators and relations]].

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b &amp; c &amp; \ldots \end{pmatrix}\sigma^{-1}=\begin{pmatrix}\sigma(a) &amp; \sigma(b) &amp; \sigma(c) &amp; \ldots\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Special elements ===
Certain elements of the symmetric group of {1, 2, ..., ''n''} are of particular interest (these can be generalized to the symmetric group of any finite totally ordered set, but not to that of an unordered set).

The '''{{visible anchor|order reversing permutation}}''' is the one given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; \cdots &amp; n\\
n &amp; n-1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
This is the unique maximal element with respect to the [[Bruhat order]] and the
[[longest element of a Coxeter group|longest element]] in the symmetric group with respect to generating set consisting of the adjacent transpositions {{nowrap|(''i'' ''i''+1)}}, {{nowrap|1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n'' − 1}}.

This is an involution, and consists of &lt;math&gt;\lfloor n/2 \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; (non-adjacent) transpositions
:&lt;math&gt;(1\,n)(2\,n-1)\cdots,\text{ or }\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\text{ adjacent transpositions: }&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;(n\,n-1)(n-1\,n-2)\cdots(2\,1)(n-1\,n-2)(n-2\,n-3)\cdots,&lt;/math&gt;

so it thus has sign:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{sgn}(\rho_n) = (-1)^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} =(-1)^{n(n-1)/2} = \begin{cases}
+1 &amp; n \equiv 0,1 \pmod{4}\\
-1 &amp; n \equiv 2,3 \pmod{4}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
which is 4-periodic in ''n''.

In S&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the ''[[Faro shuffle|perfect shuffle]]'' is the permutation that splits the set into 2 piles and interleaves them. Its sign is also &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the reverse on ''n'' elements and perfect shuffle on 2''n'' elements have the same sign; these are important to the classification of [[Clifford algebra]]s, which are 8-periodic.

== Conjugacy classes ==
The [[conjugacy class]]es of S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; correspond to the cycle structures of permutations; that is, two elements of S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are conjugate in S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if they consist of the same number of disjoint cycles of the same lengths. For instance, in S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, (1 2 3)(4 5) and (1 4 3)(2 5) are conjugate; (1 2 3)(4 5) and (1 2)(4 5) are not. A conjugating element of S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; can be constructed in "two line notation" by placing the "cycle notations" of the two conjugate permutations on top of one another.  Continuing the previous example:

:&lt;math&gt;k = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\ 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 5\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

which can be written as the product of cycles, namely: (2 4).

This permutation then relates (1 2 3)(4 5) and (1 4 3)(2 5) via conjugation, that is,

:&lt;math&gt;(2~4)\circ(1~2~3)(4~5)\circ(2~4)=(1~4~3)(2~5).&lt;/math&gt;

It is clear that such a permutation is not unique.

== Low degree groups ==
{{See also|Representation theory of the symmetric group#Special cases}}
The low-degree symmetric groups have simpler and exceptional structure, and often must be treated separately.

;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: The symmetric groups on the [[empty set]] and the [[singleton set]] are trivial, which corresponds to {{nowrap|1=0! = 1! = 1}}.  In this case the alternating group agrees with the symmetric group, rather than being an index 2 subgroup, and the sign map is trivial. In the case of S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, its only member is the [[empty function]].

;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: This group consists of exactly two elements: the identity and the permutation swapping the two points.  It is a [[cyclic group]] and is thus [[abelian group|abelian]].  In [[Galois theory]], this corresponds to the fact that the [[quadratic formula]] gives a direct solution to the general [[quadratic polynomial]] after extracting only a single root.  In [[invariant theory]], the representation theory of the symmetric group on two points is quite simple and is seen as writing a function of two variables as a sum of its symmetric and anti-symmetric parts: Setting {{nowrap|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'', ''y'') = f(''x'', ''y'') + f(''y'', ''x'')}}, and {{nowrap|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'', ''y'') = ''f''(''x'', ''y'') − ''f''(''y'', ''x'')}}, one gets that {{nowrap|1=2⋅''f'' = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; + ''f''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  This process is known as [[symmetrization]].

;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;: S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is the first nonabelian symmetric group.  This group is isomorphic to the [[dihedral group of order 6]], the group of reflection and rotation symmetries of an [[equilateral triangle]], since these symmetries permute the three vertices of the triangle. Cycles of length two correspond to reflections, and cycles of length three are rotations.  In Galois theory, the sign map from S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to the resolving quadratic for a [[cubic polynomial]], as discovered by [[Gerolamo Cardano]], while the A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; kernel corresponds to the use of the [[discrete Fourier transform]] of order 3 in the solution, in the form of [[Lagrange resolvent]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}

;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;: The group [[Wikiversity:Symmetric group S4|S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] is isomorphic to the group of proper rotations about opposite faces, opposite diagonals and opposite edges, [[Rencontres numbers|9, 8 and 6]] permutations, of the [[cube]].&lt;ref&gt;Die Untergruppenverbände der Gruppen der ordnung weniger als 100, Habilitationsschrift, J. Neubuser, Universität Kiel, Germany, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the group [[Alternating group|A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; has a [[Klein four-group]] V as a proper [[normal subgroup]], namely the even transpositions {{nowrap|{(1), (1 2)(3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 4)(2 3)},}} with quotient S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In [[Galois theory]], this map corresponds to the resolving cubic to a [[quartic polynomial]], which allows the quartic to be solved by radicals, as established by [[Lodovico Ferrari]]. The Klein group can be understood in terms of the [[Lagrange resolvent]]s of the quartic.  The map from S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; also yields a 2-dimensional irreducible representation, which is an irreducible representation of a symmetric group of degree ''n'' of dimension below {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}}, which only occurs for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 4}}.

;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;: S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is the first non-solvable symmetric group.  Along with the [[special linear group]] {{nowrap|SL(2, 5)}} and the [[icosahedral group]] {{nowrap|A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; × S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is one of the three non-solvable groups of order 120, up to isomorphism.  S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Galois group]] of the general [[quintic equation]], and the fact that S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is not a [[solvable group]] translates into the non-existence of a general formula to solve [[quintic polynomial]]s by radicals.  There is an exotic inclusion map {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}} as a [[#Transitive subgroup anchor|transitive subgroup]]; the obvious inclusion map {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}} fixes a point and thus is not transitive. This yields the outer automorphism of S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, discussed below, and corresponds to the resolvent sextic of a quintic.

;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;: Unlike all other symmetric groups, S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, has an [[outer automorphism]].  Using the language of [[Galois theory]], this can also be understood in terms of [[Lagrange resolvents]]. The resolvent of a quintic is of degree 6—this corresponds to an exotic inclusion map {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}} as a transitive subgroup (the obvious inclusion map {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}} fixes a point and thus is not transitive) and, while this map does not make the general quintic solvable, it yields the exotic outer automorphism of S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;—see [[automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups]] for details.

:Note that while A&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; have an exceptional [[Schur multiplier]] (a [[Covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups|triple cover]]) and that these extend to triple covers of S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, these do not correspond to exceptional Schur multipliers of the symmetric group.

=== Maps between symmetric groups ===

Other than the trivial map {{nowrap|1=S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → 1 ≅ S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ≅ S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the sign map {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the most notable homomorphisms between symmetric groups, in order of [[relative dimension]], are:
* {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} corresponding to the exceptional normal subgroup {{nowrap|V &lt; A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}};
* {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}} (or rather, a class of such maps up to inner automorphism) corresponding to the outer automorphism of S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.
* {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}} as a transitive subgroup, yielding the outer automorphism of S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; as discussed above.
There are also a host of other homomorphisms {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} where {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; ''m''}}.

== Properties ==
Symmetric groups are [[Coxeter group]]s and [[reflection group]]s.  They can be realized as a group of reflections with respect to hyperplanes {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, 1 ≤ ''i'' &lt; ''j'' ≤ ''n''}}.  [[Braid group]]s B&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; admit symmetric groups S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as [[quotient group]]s.

[[Cayley's theorem]] states that every group ''G'' is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group on the elements of ''G'', as a group acts on itself faithfully by (left or right) multiplication.

== Relation with alternating group ==
For {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 5}}, the [[alternating group]] A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Simple group|simple]], and the induced quotient is the sign map: {{nowrap|A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} which is split by taking a transposition of two elements. Thus S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the semidirect product {{nowrap|A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋊ S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and has no other proper normal subgroups, as they would intersect A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; in either the identity (and thus themselves be the identity or a 2-element group, which is not normal), or in A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (and thus themselves be A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; or S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).

S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; acts on its subgroup A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; by conjugation, and for {{nowrap|''n'' ≠ 6}}, S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the full automorphism group of A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;: Aut(A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≅ S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Conjugation by even elements are [[inner automorphism]]s of A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; while the [[outer automorphism]] of A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of order 2 corresponds to conjugation by an odd element. For {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 6}}, there is an [[Automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups#exceptional outer automorphism|exceptional outer automorphism]] of A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; so S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is not the full automorphism group of A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Conversely, for {{nowrap|''n'' ≠ 6}}, S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has no outer automorphisms, and for {{nowrap|''n'' ≠ 2}} it has no center, so for {{nowrap|''n'' ≠ 2, 6}} it is a [[complete group]], as discussed in [[#Automorphism group|automorphism group]], below.

For {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 5}}, S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is an [[almost simple group]], as it lies between the simple group A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and its group of automorphisms.

&lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; can be embedded into &lt;math&gt;A_{n+2}&lt;/math&gt; by appending the transposition &lt;math&gt;(n+1,n+2)&lt;/math&gt; to all odd permutations, while embedding into &lt;math&gt;A_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; is impossible for &lt;math&gt;n&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

== Generators and relations ==
The symmetric group on ''n''-letters, S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, may be described as follows. It has generators: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; and relations:
*&lt;math&gt;{\sigma_i}^2 = 1,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sigma_i\sigma_j = \sigma_j\sigma_i \text{ if } j \neq i\pm 1,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;(\sigma_i\sigma_{i+1})^3 =1.\ &lt;/math&gt;

One thinks of &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i&lt;/math&gt; as swapping the ''i''th and {{nowrap|(''i'' + 1)th}} position.

Other popular generating sets include the set of transpositions that swap 1 and ''i'' for {{nowrap|2 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n''}} and a set containing any ''n''-cycle and a 2-cycle of adjacent elements in the ''n''-cycle.

== Subgroup structure ==
A [[subgroup]] of a symmetric group is called a [[permutation group]].

=== Normal subgroups ===
The [[normal subgroup]]s of the finite symmetric groups are well understood. If {{nowrap|''n'' ≤ 2}}, S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has at most 2 elements, and so has no nontrivial proper subgroups. The [[alternating group]] of degree ''n'' is always a normal subgroup, a proper one for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 2}} and nontrivial for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 3}}; for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 3}} it is in fact the only non-identity proper normal subgroup of S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, except when {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 4}} where there is one additional such normal subgroup, which is isomorphic to the [[Klein four group]].

The symmetric group on an infinite set does not have an associated alternating group: not all elements can be written as a (finite) product of transpositions. However it does contain a normal subgroup ''S'' of permutations that fix all but finitely many elements, and such permutations can be classified as either even or odd. The even elements of ''S'' form the alternating subgroup ''A'' of ''S'', and since ''A'' is even a [[characteristic subgroup]] of ''S'', it is also a normal subgroup of the full symmetric group of the infinite set. The groups ''A'' and ''S'' are the only non-identity proper normal subgroups of the symmetric group on a countably infinite set. For more details see {{harv|Scott|1987|loc=Ch. 11.3}} or {{harv|Dixon|Mortimer|1996|loc=Ch. 8.1}}.

=== Maximal subgroups ===
{{expand section|date=September 2009}}

The [[maximal subgroup]]s of the finite symmetric groups fall into three classes: the intransitive, the imprimitive, and the primitive.  The intransitive maximal subgroups are exactly those of the form {{nowrap|Sym(''k'') × Sym(''n'' − ''k'')}} for {{nowrap|1 ≤ ''k'' &lt; ''n''/2}}.  The imprimitive maximal subgroups are exactly those of the form Sym(''k'') wr Sym(''n''/''k'') where {{nowrap|2 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''n''/2}} is a proper divisor of ''n'' and "wr" denotes the [[wreath product]] acting imprimitively.  The primitive maximal subgroups are more difficult to identify, but with the assistance of the [[O'Nan–Scott theorem]] and the [[classification of finite simple groups]], {{harv|Liebeck|Praeger|Saxl|1988}} gave a fairly satisfactory description of the maximal subgroups of this type&lt;!-- though beware of typos in the low degrees--&gt; according to {{harv|Dixon|Mortimer|1996|p=268}}.

=== Sylow subgroups ===
The [[Sylow subgroup]]s of the symmetric groups are important examples of [[p-group|''p''-groups]].  They are more easily described in special cases first:

The Sylow ''p''-subgroups of the symmetric group of degree ''p'' are just the cyclic subgroups generated by ''p''-cycles.  There are {{nowrap|1=(''p'' − 1)!/(''p'' − 1) = (''p'' − 2)!}} such subgroups simply by counting generators.  The [[normalizer]] therefore has order ''p''·(''p''−1) and is known as a [[Frobenius group]] {{nowrap|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''p''(''p'' − 1)&lt;/sub&gt;}} (especially for {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 5}}), and is the [[affine general linear group]], {{nowrap|AGL(1, ''p'')}}.

The Sylow ''p''-subgroups of the symmetric group of degree ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are the [[wreath product]] of two cyclic groups of order ''p''.  For instance, when ''p'' = 3, a Sylow 3-subgroup of Sym(9) is generated by ''a'' = (1 4 7)(2 5 8)(3 6 9) and the elements ''x'' = (1 2 3), ''y'' = (4 5 6), ''z'' = (7 8 9)&lt;!-- or just use (1,2,3) --&gt;, and every element of the Sylow 3-subgroup has the form ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''z''&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt; for 0 ≤ ''i'',''j'',''k'',''l'' ≤ 2.

The Sylow ''p''-subgroups of the symmetric group of degree ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; are sometimes denoted W&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''), and using this notation one has that {{nowrap|W&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'' + 1)}} is the wreath product of W&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') and W&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(1).

In general, the Sylow ''p''-subgroups of the symmetric group of degree ''n'' are a direct product of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; copies of W&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''i''), where 0 ≤ ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤ ''p'' − 1 and ''n'' = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''p''·''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;·''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; (the base ''p'' expansion of ''n'').

For instance, W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(1) =&amp;nbsp;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2) =&amp;nbsp;D&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[dihedral group of order 8]], and so a Sylow 2-subgroup of the symmetric group of degree 7 is generated by { (1,3)(2,4), (1,2), (3,4), (5,6) } and is isomorphic to D&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

These calculations are attributed to {{harv|Kaloujnine|1948}} and described in more detail in {{harv|Rotman|1995|p=176}}.  Note however that {{harv|Kerber|1971|p=26}} attributes the result to an 1844 work of [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]], and mentions that it is even covered in textbook form in {{harv|Netto|1882|loc=§39–40}}.

===&lt;span id="Transitive subgroup anchor"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Transitive subgroups ===&lt;!-- Transitive subgroup redirects to this anchor--&gt;
A '''transitive subgroup''' of S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a subgroup whose action on {1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;,...,&amp;nbsp;''n''} is [[transitive action|transitive]]. For example, the Galois group of a ([[finite extension|finite]]) [[Galois extension]] is a transitive subgroup of S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, for some ''n''.

For {{nowrap|''n'' ≠ 2, 6}}, S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[complete group]]: its [[center (group theory)|center]] and [[outer automorphism group]] are both trivial.

For {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}}, the automorphism group is trivial, but S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not trivial: it is isomorphic to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is abelian, and hence the center is the whole group.

For {{math|1=''n'' = 6}}, it has an outer automorphism of order 2: {{nowrap|1=Out(S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) = C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and the automorphism group is a semidirect product
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{S}_6)=\mathrm{S}_6 \rtimes \mathrm{C}_2.\ &lt;/math&gt;

In fact, for any set ''X'' of cardinality other than 6, every automorphism of the symmetric group on ''X'' is inner, a result first due to {{harv|Schreier|Ulam|1937}} according to {{harv|Dixon|Mortimer|1996|p=259}}.

== Homology ==
{{see also|Alternating group#Group homology}}
The [[group homology]] of S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is quite regular and stabilizes: the first homology (concretely, the [[abelianization]]) is:

:&lt;math&gt;H_1(\mathrm{S}_n,\mathbf{Z}) = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; n &lt; 2\\
\mathbf{Z}/2 &amp; n \geq 2.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The first homology group is the abelianization, and corresponds to the sign map S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is the abelianization for ''n'' ≥ 2; for ''n'' &lt; 2 the symmetric group is trivial. This homology is easily computed as follows: S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is generated by involutions (2-cycles, which have order 2), so the only non-trivial maps {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → C&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are to S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and all involutions are conjugate, hence map to the same element in the abelianization (since conjugation is trivial in abelian groups). Thus the only possible maps {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≅ {±1} }} send an involution to 1 (the trivial map) or to −1 (the sign map). One must also show that the sign map is well-defined, but assuming that, this gives the first homology of S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The second homology (concretely, the [[Schur multiplier]]) is:
:&lt;math&gt;H_2(\mathrm{S}_n,\mathbf{Z}) = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; n &lt; 4\\
\mathbf{Z}/2 &amp; n \geq 4.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
This was computed in {{Harv|Schur|1911}}, and corresponds to the [[covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups|double cover of the symmetric group]], 2 · S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Note that the [[exceptional object|exceptional]] low-dimensional homology of the alternating group (&lt;math&gt;H_1(\mathrm{A}_3)\cong H_1(\mathrm{A}_4) \cong \mathrm{C}_3,&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to non-trivial abelianization, and &lt;math&gt;H_2(\mathrm{A}_6)\cong H_2(\mathrm{A}_7) \cong \mathrm{C}_6,&lt;/math&gt; due to the exceptional 3-fold cover) does not change the homology of the symmetric group; the alternating group phenomena do yield symmetric group phenomena – the map &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}_4 \twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{C}_3&lt;/math&gt; extends to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S}_4 \twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{S}_3,&lt;/math&gt; and the triple covers of A&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; extend to triple covers of S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; – but these are not ''homological'' – the map &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S}_4 \twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{S}_3&lt;/math&gt; does not change the abelianization of S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and the triple covers do not correspond to homology either.

The homology "stabilizes" in the sense of [[stable homotopy]] theory: there is an inclusion map {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and for fixed ''k'', the induced map on homology {{nowrap|''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) → ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is an isomorphism for sufficiently high ''n''. This is analogous to the homology of families [[Lie groups]] stabilizing.

The homology of the infinite symmetric group is computed in {{Harv|Nakaoka|1961}}, with the cohomology algebra forming a [[Hopf algebra]].

== Representation theory ==
{{main article|Representation theory of the symmetric group}}

The [[representation theory of the symmetric group]] is a particular case of the [[representation theory of finite groups]], for which a concrete and detailed theory can be obtained. This has a large area of potential applications, from [[symmetric function]] theory to problems of [[quantum mechanics]] for a number of [[identical particles]].

The symmetric group S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has order ''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Its [[conjugacy class]]es are labeled by [[integer partition|partition]]s of&amp;nbsp;''n''. Therefore, according to the representation theory of a finite group, the number of inequivalent [[irreducible representation]]s, over the [[complex number]]s, is equal to the number of partitions of&amp;nbsp;''n''. Unlike the general situation for finite groups, there is in fact a natural way to parametrize irreducible representation by the same set that parametrizes conjugacy classes, namely by partitions of ''n'' or equivalently [[Young diagram]]s of size&amp;nbsp;''n''.

Each such irreducible representation can be realized over the integers (every permutation acting by a matrix with integer coefficients); it can be explicitly constructed by computing the [[Young symmetrizer]]s acting on a space generated by the [[Young tableau]]x of shape given by the Young diagram.

Over other [[Field (mathematics)|field]]s the situation can become much more complicated.  If the field ''K'' has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] equal to zero or greater than ''n'' then by [[Maschke's theorem]] the [[group algebra]] ''K''S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is semisimple. In these cases the irreducible representations defined over the integers give the complete set of irreducible representations (after reduction modulo the characteristic if necessary).

However, the irreducible representations of the symmetric group are not known in arbitrary characteristic. In this context it is more usual to use the language of [[module (mathematics)|module]]s rather than representations. The representation obtained from an irreducible representation defined over the integers by reducing modulo the characteristic will not in general be irreducible. The modules so constructed are called ''[[Specht modules]]'', and every irreducible does arise inside some such module. There are now fewer irreducibles, and although they can be classified they are very poorly understood. For example, even their [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]]s are not known in general.

The determination of the irreducible modules for the symmetric group over an arbitrary field is widely regarded as one of the most important open problems in representation theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7134">The '''Institute of Classical Architecture &amp; Art''' ('''ICAA'''), founded as two separate nonprofit organizations - ''The Institute of Classical Architecture'' and ''Classical America'' in 1991 and 1968, respectively - merged in 2002 as a national organization dedicated to advancing the classical tradition in [[architecture]], [[urbanism]], and their allied arts. It does so through education, publication, awards, and advocacy. Today there are fifteen regional Institute chapters and an international UK affiliate that together extend this unique public service.

The organization is a valued educational resource for students of art, planning, and architecture; for design professionals; and for the general public. It offers a wide array of programs including continuing education classes, travel programs, lectures, salons, and conferences. It publishes an academic journal called [http://www.classicist.org/publications-and-bookshop/the-classicist/ ''The Classicist''] as well as the acclaimed book series, the [http://www.classicist.org/publications-and-bookshop/classical-america-series-in-art-and-architecture/ ''Classical America Series in Art and Architecture'']. The [[Grand Central Academy of Art]] flourishes as the ICAA’s division of fine arts pedagogy, while the [[Beaux-Arts Atelier]] welcomes students of classical architecture and design.

Partnerships with non-architect, building, and residential designers via the American Institute of Building Design as well as [[Habitat for Humanity International]] bring the traditional design skills sustained and disseminated by the Institute to bear in diverse communities across America. An official Institute blog offers a further voice for advocacy.

Awarded annually, the Arthur Ross Awards are an increasingly recognized awards program administered by the Institute that honors excellence in the classical tradition, be it in practice, scholarship, or patronage. The first awards were presented by [[Brooke Astor]] in 1982. The Institute additionally offers two affiliated fellowships at the [[American Academy in Rome]] to advance the career of the architect or artist recipient and to foster a continuity of knowledge of the classical tradition as a vital aspect of contemporary culture around the globe.

==Academic Programs==
The Institute of Classical Architecture &amp; Art (ICAA) is the leading national nonprofit educational organization dedicated to advancing the practice and appreciation of the classical tradition in architecture, urbanism, and the allied arts. Under the heading “Academic Programs” the ICAA has developed a wide variety of course offerings, including studio-based seminars, lectures and travel tours. By adapting course content and crafting delivery methods to meet the educational needs of a diverse body of learners, the ICAA has pioneered an ecumenical curriculum model aimed to educate all individuals interested in mastering the language of classical design.

==Prizes and Scholarships==
The ICAA offers two bi-annual prizes, [[The Rieger Graham Prize]] for architecture and the [[Alma Schapiro Prize]] for fine artists. The prizes alternate years and grant the recipient a three-month Fellowship at the [[American Academy in Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicist.org/awards-and-prizes/alma-schapiro-prize/application/|title=Institute of Classical Architecture &amp; Art — Awards &amp; Prizes|last=America|first=Institute of Classical Architecture &amp; Classical|website=www.classicist.org|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, the ICAA also awards the [[Stanford White Awards]] for "excellence in classical and traditional design".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classicist.org/awards-and-prizes/stanford-white-awards/ Stanford White Award]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public Programs==
[[File:Wall of books.jpg|alt=Looking up at rows of bookcases|thumb|Bookcases at New York office]]

In addition to training professionals and students, the ICAA also serves the general public audience and professional audience through its public lectures, walking tours, travel programs and special events. Offered throughout the year, activities include a Member Lecture Program, often free of charge to members and often in collaboration with like-minded organizations; and Discover Classical New York, which takes members on walking tours to visit classical or traditional sites in the five boroughs and beyond.

Other signature programs include the annual The McKim Lecture with the [[One West 54th Street Foundation]] and the Summer Lecture Series. Special events include the Arthur Ross Awards, which celebrate excellence in the classical tradition, and the bi-annual Holiday Benefit Auction, as well as occasional salon-style gatherings.

The ICAA Chapters offer a wide range of comparable programs themed and tied geographically to their respective regions.

==Publications==
Publications play a large role in the mission of the ICAA and are overseen by the Publications Committee, an active volunteer group made up of ICAA board members, staff, Fellows, and members of the Council of Advisors. The committee regularly reviews re-printing possibilities for texts that are no longer available, as well as proposals for new books to be included in the “Classical America Series in Art and Architecture”. This important series is a legacy from [[Classical America]] which the ICAA now vigorously maintains today. The budget each year includes grant subsidies for either authors or publishers selected to be part of the series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5528">'''The King of England and his Three Sons''' is a Gypsy [[fairy tale]] collected by [[Joseph Jacobs]] in ''More English Fairy Tales''.  He listed as his source [[Francis Hindes Groome]]'s ''In Gypsy Tents'', where the informant was John Roberts, a Welsh gypsy.&lt;ref name="jacobs"&gt;Joseph Jacobs, ''More English Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/jacobs/moreenglish/kingengland.html "The King of England and his Three Sons"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of this tale appears in [[The Red King and the Witch: Gypsy Folk and Fairy Tales]] by [[Ruth Manning-Sanders]], under the title ''An Old King and His Three Sons of England''.

== Synopsis ==

An old king could be cured only by golden apples from a far country.  His three sons set out to find them, and parted ways at a crossroads.  The [[youngest son]] found a house in a forest, where an old man greeted him as a king's son, and told him to put his horse in the stable and have something to eat.  After the meal, he asked how the man knew he was a king's son, and the man said he knew many things, including what the prince was doing.  He told the prince that he had to stay there the night, though many snakes and toads would crawl over him, and if he stirred, he would turn into one himself.

The prince got little sleep but did not stir.  In the morning, the old man gave him breakfast, a new horse, and a ball of yarn to throw between the horse's ears.  When the prince threw it and chased it, he came to the old man's brother, who was uglier than the first one.  He received the same hospitality, and the same unpleasant night, and this brother sent him on to the [[Rule of three (writing)|third]] brother.

At the third brother's, the brother, who was even uglier than the second one, told him he must go on to a castle.  There, he must tell swans to bear him over the lake to a castle.  It was guarded by [[Giant (mythology)|giants]], lions, and [[dragon]]s, but they would be asleep, and so he must go in at one o'clock and come out again by two.  He must go through some grand rooms, go down into the kitchen, and then go out into the garden.  There he must pick the apples.  He should come back the same way, and when riding off, never look back because they would pursue him into he nearly reached the old man's house.

He went to bed, and this time the brother assured him that nothing would disturb him, and nothing did.  In the morning, the old man warned him not to tarry because of a beautiful woman.

He reached the castle by the swans and saw a beautiful woman there.  He exchanged his garter, gold watch, and pocket-handkerchief for hers, and kissed her.  Then he got the apples and had to flee with all speed, because the hour was nearly up, but he escaped.

The old man brought him to a well and insisted that the prince cut his head off and throw it into the well.  This [[Shapeshifting|turned]] him into a young, handsome man, and the house into a palace.  At the second brother's, he received a new bed, with no snakes or toads, and cut off his head as well, and then same with the first.

He met up with his brothers again.  [[False hero|They]] stole his apples and put others in their place, and went on before him.  When he reached home, his apples were not as good as his brother's, and his father thought they were poisoned and told his headsman to cut his head off.  The headsman instead took him into the woods and left him there.  A bear came up to him, and he climbed a tree, but the bear persuaded him to come down.  The bear brought him to some tents, where they made him welcome, and changed in a handsome young man, Jubal.  He stayed with them and was happy, although he had lost the golden watch somewhere.  One day, he saw it in the tree where he had climbed to hide from the bear, and climbed it to get it again.

Meanwhile, the princess, realizing one of the king's sons had been there, set out with an army.  When she reached the king, she demanded to see his sons.  When the oldest came, he said he had been to her castle, but when she threw down the handkerchief and he walked over it, he broke his leg; then the second brother said the same, but also broke his leg.  She demanded of the king whether he had more sons; the king sent to the headsman, who confessed he had not killed the prince, and the king said he must find him, to save the king's life.  They found Jubal, who pointed to the tree where the prince was, and they told the prince he must come because a lady was looking for him, and they brought Jubal with them.  He did not break his leg over the handkerchief, and the princess knew he was the prince, so they married, and went back to her castle.

==Commentary==
Jacobs noted the king with three sons was a common motif, and that the [[Sleeping Beauty]] is found in [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]].&lt;ref name="jacobs" /&gt;

"'''The Teapot'''" ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Theepotten'') is a literary [[fairy tale]] by Danish [[poet]] and [[author]] [[Hans Christian Andersen]] about a teapot and her adventures. The tale was first published 1863 and demonstrates the Andersen's talent for investing ordinary household objects with life, character, and personality.

== Plot summary ==
A porcelain teapot rules the tea table. She is very proud of her handle and spout, but not quite so proud of her lid (which is cracked). She is very proud of holding the tea leaves and of being the one to pour forth her contents for thirsty humankind. One day, the teapot is dropped and the handle and spout are broken. She is given to a beggar woman who fills her with soil and plants a flowering bulb within her. The teapot then feels a happiness she has never known. At the last, the teapot is broken in two, the bulb removed to a bigger pot, and the teapot thrown away. She cherishes her memories.

== Publication history==
[[Image:teapot Pedersen 01.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Lorenz Frølich]], an early illustrator of Andersen's works]]
The tale was first published December 1863 in ''Folkekalender for Danmark''. The work was republished 12 December 1871 in the fourth volume of ''Fairy Tales and Stories. 1871.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/register/info_e.html?vid=160 |publisher=Hans Christian Andersen Center |title=Hans Christian Andersen: The Teapot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tomb of the Unknown Soldier''' ({{lang-pl|Grób Nieznanego Żołnierza}}) is a monument in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], dedicated to the unknown soldiers who have given their lives for Poland. It is one of many such national [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|tombs of unknowns]] that were erected after [[World War I]], and the most important such monument in Poland.&lt;ref name="MON"&gt;{{cite web | author=MON (corporate author) | title=Grób Nieznanego Żołnierza | publisher=Ministry of National Defence | date=2005-10-24 | work=wojsko-polskie.pl | url=http://www.wojsko-polskie.pl/articles/view/3109 | accessdate=2012-12-36 | language=pl | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420195127/http://www.wojsko-polskie.pl/articles/view/3109 | archivedate=2013-04-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument, located at [[Piłsudski Square]], is the only surviving part of the [[Saxon Palace]] that occupied the spot until [[World War II]]. Since 2 November 1925 the tomb houses the [[unidentified decedent|unidentified body]] of a young soldier who fell during the [[Battle of Lemberg (1918)|Defence of Lwów]]. Since then, earth from numerous battlefields where Polish soldiers have fought has been added to the urns housed in the surviving pillars of the Saxon Palace. 

The Tomb is constantly lit by an [[eternal flame]] and assisted by a guard post by the [[Representative Company of the Polish Army]]. It is there that most official military commemorations take place in Poland and where foreign representatives lay wreaths when visiting Poland. 

The changing of the guard takes place on the hour of every hour daily and this happens 365 days a year.

==History==

In 1923, a group of unknown Varsovians placed, before Warsaw's [[Saxon Palace]] and the adjacent [[Saxon Garden]], a stone tablet commemorating all the unknown Polish soldiers who had fallen in World War I and the subsequent [[Polish-Soviet War]]. This initiative was taken up by several Warsaw newspapers and by General [[Władysław Sikorski]]. On April 4, 1925, the Polish Ministry of War selected a battlefield from which the ashes of an unknown soldier would be brought to Warsaw. Of some 40 battles, [[Lviv#Polish-Ukrainian fights|that for Lwów]] was chosen. In October 1925, at [[Lviv|Lwów's]] [[Cemetery of the Defenders of Lwów]], three coffins were exhumed: those of an unknown sergeant, corporal, and private. The coffin that was to be transported to Warsaw was chosen by Jadwiga Zarugiewiczowa, mother of a soldier who had fallen [[Battle of Zadwórze|at Zadwórze]] and whose body had never been found.

On November 2, 1925, the coffin was brought to Warsaw's [[St. John's Cathedral, Warsaw|St. John's Cathedral]], where a Mass was held. Afterward eight recipients of the order of [[Virtuti Militari]] bore the coffin to its final resting place beneath the colonnade joining the two wings of the [[Saxon Palace]]. The coffin was buried along with 14 urns containing soil from as many battlegrounds, a Virtuti Militari medal, and a memorial tablet. Since then, except under German occupation during [[World War II]], an [[honor guard]] has continuously been held before the Tomb.

==Architecture==
The Tomb was designed by the famous Polish sculptor, [[Stanisław Kazimierz Ostrowski]]. It was located within the [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] that linked the two symmetric wings of the [[Palac Saski|Saxon Palace]], then the seat of the Polish [[Ministry of War]]. The central tablet was ringed by 5 eternal flames and 4 stone tablets bearing the names and dates of battles in which Polish soldiers had fought during [[World War I]] and the [[Polish–Soviet War]] (1919–21). Behind the Tomb were two steel gratings bearing emblems of Poland's two highest Polish military decorations — the ''[[Virtuti Militari]]'' and [[Cross of Valour (Poland)|Cross of Valor]].

During the 1939 [[invasion of Poland]], the building was slightly damaged by German aerial bombing, but it was quickly rebuilt and seized by the German authorities. After the [[Warsaw Uprising]], in December 1944, the palace was [[Planned destruction of Warsaw|completely demolished]] by the [[Wehrmacht]]. Only part of the central colonnade, sheltering the Tomb, was preserved.

After the war, in late 1945, reconstruction began. Only a small part of the palace, containing the Tomb, was restored by [[Henryk Grunwald]]. On 8 May 1946 it was opened to the public. Soil from 24 additional battlegrounds was added to the urns, as well as more tablets with names of battles in which Poles had fought in [[World War II]]. However, the communist authorities erased all trace of the Polish–Soviet War of 1920, and only a few of the Polish Armed Forces' battles in the West were included. This was corrected in 1990, after Poland had regained its political autonomy.

There are plans to rebuild the [[Saxon Palace]], but as of May 2016, these plans have been indefinitely on hold due to a lack of budget.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

[[File:Hofkirche Innsbruck 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Tyrolean Folk Art Museum next to the Hofkirche in Innsbruck]]
The '''Tyrolean Folk Art Museum''' ({{lang-de|Tiroler Volkskunstmuseum}}) is considered one of the finest regional heritage museums in Europe.&lt;ref name="tyrol.com"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=Tyrol Folk Art Museum and Hofkirche |work=Tyrol |date= |url=http://www.tyrol.com/a-tyrol-folk-art-museum-and-hofkirche |accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located next to the [[Hofkirche, Innsbruck|Hofkirche]] and across from the [[Hofburg, Innsbruck|Hofburg]] in the Altstadt section of [[Innsbruck]], Austria, the museum contains the most important collection of cultural artifacts from the Tyrol region.&lt;ref name="tyrol.com"/&gt;

The Tyrolean Folk Art Museum is housed in four wings of a former Franciscan monastery (the displaced community later established [[Lienz Friary]]) around an arcaded Renaissance courtyard. The permanent exhibition includes an extensive collection of old handicrafts, traditional costumes, household items, glass and pottery, peasant furniture, textiles, tools, metalwork, and religious and secular folk art from the various regions of Tyrol.

The museum houses several carefully restored wood-paneled rooms from the Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque periods, that came from actual farms and noble houses.&lt;ref name="tyrol.com"/&gt; The museum also contains an extensive collection of mangers made of wood, wax, earthenware, and paper, dating back to the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="tyrol.com"/&gt;
