==History==
Mushimba, who was the brother of President [[Sam Nujoma]]'s wife, [[Kovambo Nujoma]], was involved in the liberation struggle beginning in the early 1960s. As the national organiser for [[SWAPO]] inside the country, he was arrested and tortured several times by the [[apartheid]] authorities in the mid-1970s. In 1975 he was arrested in connection with the assassination of Ndonga Chief Filemon Elifas, the Chief Minister of the tribal [[Ovamboland|Ovambo]] Executive. Mushimba was sentenced to death but released on appeal in 1977 after it was found that the defense had leaked documents to the prosecution in his original trial. After his release he left for exile, where he acted as a 'fixer' for SWAPO, particularly concerning money matters. During the 1980s he was Deputy Treasurer on the SWAPO Politburo. His political track record and the fact that he was Nujoma's brother-in-law did not prevent him being detained by SWAPO in the late 1980s.

With independence, Mushimba played a dominant role in a number of business initiatives ranging from fishing through banking to construction. Several made newspaper headlines in the 1990s. He was chairman of Stocks and Stocks Namibia when the company built the [[Windhoek Country Club and Resort]]. The hotel's construction fell so far behind schedule that its launch event, the [[Miss Universe 1995|Miss Universe pageant of 1995]], had to be held with the complex only part-completed. By the end of the decade, the government owned the hotel after Stocks and Stocks failed to pay its debts. Stocks and Stocks also won contracts worth over N$300 million to build government office buildings in the 1990s. The government granted Mushimba's mining company, PE Minerals, the mineral rights for the [[Rosh Pinah mine|Rosh Pinah zinc mine]] in 1995. Following three years of uncertainty over the future of the mine, [[PE Minerals]] signed a partnership deal with the mine owners, [[Mittal Steel South Africa|Iscor]], at the end of 1998. Another company that Mushimba heads, Namibian Harvest Investments, bought the majority share in the struggling City Savings and Investment Bank in 2001.

Mushimba was reported to be acting as the representative of international diamond trader [[Maurice Tempelsman]], who in 2002 offered the government an interest free loan in return for keeping [[De Beers]]'exclusive marketing contract for NamDeb's diamonds. He has also emerged as a key player in Epia Investments, the empowerment company formed by Ohlthaver and List, the owners of [[Namibia Breweries Limited|Namibia Breweries]]. Mushimba has played a key role in several of Namibia's largest black empowerment deals.&lt;ref name="NID"/&gt;

Mushimba died on 31 August 2014 in a Cape Town hospital where he had been hospitalised for three weeks previous. According to his daughter Ujama, Mushimba was admitted for a back surgery, but suffered complications after the operation . He was 67.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

'''Acqui-hiring''' or '''Acq-hiring''' (a [[portmanteau]] of "acquisition" and "hiring") or '''talent acquisition''', is the process of [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquiring]] a company to [[Recruitment|recruit]] its employees, without necessarily showing an interest in its current products and services—or their continued operation.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eremedia.com/ere/acqui-hiring-a-powerful-recruiting-strategy-that-youve-never-heard-of//|title=Acqui-hiring: A Powerful Recruiting Strategy That You’ve Never Heard of |publisher=ERE.net |last=Sullivan|first=John|date=10 December 2012|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yarow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-so-many-startups-are-being-acqui-hired-2012-8|title=Why So Many Startups Are Being Acqui-Hired |last=Yarow|first=Jay|date=10 August 2012|work=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Some technology blogs call it being 'acqhired.' The companies doing the buying say it is a talent acquisition, and it typically comes with a price per head," the ''New York Times'' reported in a page-one story describing the phenomenon on May 17, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For Buyers of Web Start-Ups, Quest to Corral Young Talent|last=Helft, Miguel|date=17 May  2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/18/technology/18talent.html|publisher=New York Times, page 1|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The process of a talent acquisition also provides a relatively favorable [[exit strategy]] for employees with the prestige of being bought by a larger company, combined with the typical process of hiring.&lt;ref name=atd-nosense&gt;{{cite web|title=The Vanity of the "Acqhire": Why Do a Deal That Makes No Sense?|url=http://allthingsd.com/20120810/the-vanity-of-the-acqhire-why-do-a-deal-that-makes-no-sense/|publisher=All Things D|accessdate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, linguist [[Ben Zimmer]], in an article appearing on Visual Thesaurus, traced the derivation of the phrase to a blog post in May, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buzzword Watch: "Acq-hire"|last=Zimmer, Ben|date=29 September  2010|url=http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/buzzword-watch-acq-hire/|publisher=Visual Thesaurus|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acqui-hiring has become increasingly common in [[venture capital|VC]]-backed [[startup company|startup companies]], especially within the competitive [[technology]] sector; as of March 2013, [[Facebook]] was the largest performer of talent acquisitions, with 12 over the last five [[Fiscal year|fiscal quarters]]. [[Twitter]], [[Yahoo!]], and [[Google]] rank alongside Facebook as similarly major users of talent acquisitions.&lt;ref name=ubj-acquihire&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook leads growing acqui-hire craze|url=http://upstart.bizjournals.com/money/loot/2013/03/28/facebook-leads-growing-acqui-hire-craze.html?page=all|publisher=Upstart Business Journal|accessdate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acqui-hiring is facilitated by [[Acquisourcing|acqui-sourcing]] - the process of identifying companies that agree to be acquired.

'''Why companies practice Acqui-hiring'''

There are various reasons why companies engage in acqui-hiring. These include helping to reduce the risk of litigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coyle |first1=John F. |last2=Polsky |first2=Gregg D. |title=ACQUI-HIRING |journal=Duke Law Journal |date=November 2013 |volume=63 |issue=2 |page=301-317 |url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=3400&amp;context=dlj}}&lt;/ref&gt; reduce money expenditure when hiring a large group of employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coyle |first1=John F. |last2=Polsky |first2=Gregg D. |title=ACQUI-HIRING |journal=Duke Law Journal |date=November 2013 |volume=63 |issue=2 |page=301-317 |url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=3400&amp;context=dlj}}&lt;/ref&gt; or hide the failures of start-up companies from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bensona |first1=David |last2=Ziedonis |first2=Rosemarie H. |title=Corporate venture capital and the returns to acquiring portfolio companies |journal=Journal of Financial Economics |date=December 2010 |volume=98 |issue=3 |page=478-499 |doi=10.1016/j.jfineco.2010.07.003 |url=http://isiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/48229.pdf |accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Is Acqui-hiring right for your firm?'''

While Acqui-hiring is a great modern that companies seem to be shifting to, one needs to consider whether their company is fit for the process. some of the factors that need to be put into consideration such as, the company should ensure that there is need tor a huge number of personnel before engaging in Aqui-hiring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chatterji |first1=Aaron |last2=Patro |first2=Arun |title=Dynamic Capabilities and Managing Human Capital |journal=Academy of Management Perspectives |date=29 Oct 2014 |volume=28 |issue=4 |url=https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amp.2013.0111 |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There should also be an easy access to the pool of customers for the company that intends to engage in Acqui-hiring and finally when a comparatively large company intends to beat smaller companies to acquisition of employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chatterji |first1=Aaron |last2=Patro |first2=Arun |title=Dynamic Capabilities and Managing Human Capital |journal=Academy of Management Perspectives |date=29 Oct 2014 |volume=28 |issue=4 |url=https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amp.2013.0111 |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahn Cheol-soo''' ({{ko-hhrm|안철수}} {{IPA-ko|an tɕʰʌl.s͈u|}}; born 26 February 1962) is a [[South Korea]]n politician, physician, and software entrepreneur. A two-time former presidential election candidate in [[South Korean presidential election, 2012|2012]] and [[South Korean presidential election, 2017|2017]], Ahn is currently the [[Bareunmirae Party]]'s candidate for the [[Seoul]] [[Mayor of Seoul|mayorship]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3046505|title=Ahn Cheol-soo declares bid for Seoul mayor|website=Korea JoongAng Daily|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He ran as an independent candidate for the [[South Korean presidential election, 2012|presidential election in 2012]], but withdrew a month before the election took place to support [[Moon Jae-in]] whom he ran against in 2017 as the [[People's Party (South Korea, 2016)|People's Party]] nominee. He was a founding co-leader and the party leader of the People's Party until his party and [[Bareun Party]] merged as [[Bareunmirae Party]] in February 2018. 

Prior to politics, Ahn founded [[AhnLab, Inc.]], an [[antivirus software]] company, in 1995. He was chairman of the board and [[Chief Learning Officer]] of AhnLab until September 2012, and remains the company's largest stakeholder. Prior to entering politics, Ahn served as dean of the Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology at [[Seoul National University]] until September 2012.

==Early life and education==
Ahn was born on 26 February 1962, in [[Miryang]], [[South Korea]], while his father was on military service there; he subsequently moved with his family to [[Busan]], where he grew up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/555525.html|title=The vetting of Ahn Cheol-soo|newspaper=[[The Hankyoreh]]|date=12 October 2012|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn was not an academic child but had number academic hobbies such as reading.&lt;ref&gt;http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=109&amp;aid=0002032901&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his Doctor of Medicine (MD), Master of Science (MS), and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees in [[physiology]] from [[Seoul National University]] between 1980 and 1991. He became the youngest chief of professors at [[Dankook University]] medical college at 27 years of age, marking his first career as a medical doctor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2011/09/113_94248.html|title=Who is Ahn Cheol-soo|date=2011-09-05|work=koreatimes|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ahn met his wife whilst in university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.jkn.co.kr/article/news/20090618/3355840.htm|title=‘무릎팍도사’ 출연 안철수, “부인과는 유명한 캠퍼스 커플, 프러포즈는…”|last=재경일보|date=2009-06-18|work=재경일보|access-date=2018-05-10|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst working as a graduate student pursuing his MD, Ahn began to gain an interest in computer software as a hobby, in particular, [[antivirus software]]. Ahn soon began working on his own antivirus software after he was confronted with a virus that was mass-infecting computers in Korea. Ahn was soon infected with the same virus and reverse engineered the virus in an attempt to erase it from his disk drive which was successful. The program he wrote to help get rid of the virus was eventually called "Vaccine"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsen.com/news_view.php?uid=200906180048251001|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Ahn distributed for free.

== Business Career ==

=== AhnLab, Inc ===
After finishing military service as a medical officer in the [[Republic of Korea Navy|South Korean navy]], and leaving behind his career in the medical profession, Cheol-soo went on to establish his venture company [[AhnLab, Inc.|AhnLab, Inc]] in March 1995&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; after being advised by a software company official to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=029&amp;aid=0001985929|title=안철수 KAIST 교수, 17일 무릎팍 도사 출연|access-date=2018-05-10|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn had previously attempted to distribute V3 via Samsung's brand though Samsung rejected Ahn's offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artsnews.mk.co.kr/news/29862|title=안철수, 1000만 불 인수제의 거절한 이유!! {{!}} 아츠뉴스|website=artsnews.mk.co.kr|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ahn, not knowing how to run a business at first, struggled for the first several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=143&amp;aid=0001993990|title=‘무릎팍도사’ 안철수, 반쪽짜리 감동|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst managing the company, Ahn was also attempting to get a master's degree in engineering at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he graduated in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/society/201103/h2011031821075622020.htm|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn eventually received a $10 million offer from US software giant, [[McAfee]]&lt;ref&gt;민도식, 나를 확바꾸는 실천 독서법 북포스 155페이지 '1997년 직원들에게 안철수연구소를 맡겨둔채 미국에서 유학하며 실리콘벨리에 머물던 중 현재 경쟁회사 맥아피에게 1천만달러 제안 받았지만 거절'&lt;/ref&gt; and Ahn met with [[John McAfee]] personally. McAfee was struggling to expand into South Korea due to AhnLab, Inc and wanted to purchase the company in an attempt to monopolize the anti-virus software market in South Korea. Ahn rejected the offer because, despite the AhnLab, Inc struggling, selling the company would lead to widespread redundancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=015&amp;aid=0002085972|title='무릎팍도사' 출연 안철수, 온화한 카리스마로 시청자 압도|access-date=2018-05-10|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hkn24.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=27942|title=무릎팍 안철수 “외국회사 1000만불 매각제의 단호히 거절” - 헬스코리아뉴스|access-date=2018-05-10|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the company began to run a surplus after the CIH virus became widespread in Korea and people needed to buy V3 to protect against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=101&amp;oid=047&amp;aid=0001963116|title=안철수 "정치할 생각 있냐고요?"|access-date=2018-05-10|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1999, AhnLab, Inc became the second biggest computer security company in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asiatoday.co.kr/view.php?key=258456|title=‘무릎팍도사’ 출연 안철수, “한국의 빌게이츠(?)...너무 과분해”|work=종합일간지 : 신문/웹/모바일 등 멀티 채널로 국내외 실시간 뉴스와 수준 높은 정보를 제공|access-date=2018-05-10|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same company later became the largest computer security company in South Korea,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2009/10/258_40800.html ''AhnLab Looks to Perform in International Stage''] at ''[[The Korea Times|Korea Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreaittimes.com/story/5502/ahnlab-considers-overseas-ma ''AhnLab Considers Overseas M&amp;A''] at ''Korea IT Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/world/asia/new-voice-in-south-korean-politics-enters-presidential-race.html|title=New Voice in South Korean Politics, Ahn Cheol-soo, Enters Presidential Race|last=Gladstone|first=Rick|date=2012-09-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-29|last2=Lee|first2=Su-hyun|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was included in annual lists of Korea's most admired companies by Korea Management Association Consulting between 2004 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmac.co.kr/certify/certify_01a_1.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024034/http://www.kmac.co.kr/certify/certify_01a_1.asp |archivedate=2016-03-04 }} {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiae.co.kr/uhtml/read.php?idxno=2008022017371847343 ''AhnLab, "The Korea's Most Admired company" Consecutive 5 years''] at ''Asia Economy'' (2008.02.20). {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="awards"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kr.ahnlab.com/company/eng/about/milestone.jsp|title=AhnLab|date=|publisher=Kr.ahnlab.com|accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.mk.co.kr/outside/view.php?year=2008&amp;no=92321 ''Samsung Electronics Most Admired Company in Korea: Survey''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723173328/http://news.mk.co.kr/outside/view.php?year=2008&amp;no=92321 |date=23 July 2011 }} at ''Maeil Business Newspaper'' &amp; mk.co.kr&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/book/297104.html Book review "''세상에서 가장 안전한 이름 안철수 연구소''"] at ''[[The Hankyoreh]]''. {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned as CEO in 2005 and served as chairman of the board until 2012.

Ahn revealed that [[John McAfee]] once suggested it would acquire AhnLab for $10,000,000 but rejected the offer. He mentioned patriotic reasons about the decision saying that selling AhnLab might allow a foreign firm to dominate the Korean market.

=== Later life and education ===
Ahn became an outside director of [[POSCO]] in 2005, and from 2010 to 2011 was chairman of the company.

Ahn was awarded an Executive Master of Business Administration (EMBA) degree from the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School]] (San Francisco campus) in 2008. He then became a professor at [[KAIST]] in 2008, and later in the beginning of 2011 became the Dean of the Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology at [[Seoul National University]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Political career==

===Entry into politics ===
Since 2006, Ahn had been offered places in the main political parties but was constantly denied any chance to run as an independent due to opposing factions.

In early September 2011, speculation spread that Ahn would enter politics by competing in the 26 October Seoul mayoral by-election. The Democratic Party and Liberty Korea Party attempted to recruit Ahn for the mayoral by-election though they failed due to Ahn feeling like he, and many other voters, had become disenfranchised with the main two choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imbc.com/broad/tv/culture/sisa2580/vod/index.html?kind=image&amp;progCode=1000845100520100000&amp;pagesize=5&amp;pagenum=1&amp;cornerFlag=1&amp;ContentTypeID=1&amp;ProgramGroupID=0|title=다시보기 {{!}} 시사매거진 2580|website=www.imbc.com|language=ko|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn eventually made an announcement, denouncing the opposition and ruling party&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nate.com/view/20110905n06506|title=안철수, "야권과 단일화 얼마든지 고려할 수 있다"|website=네이트뉴스|language=ko-KR|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and saying he was not sure on his candidacy, deciding to watch the polls before making a choice though he shared the sentiment that he felt like it'd take a lot of work to help Seoul, saying "ten years of work" would be needed to help the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nate.com/view/20110905n07503|title=안철수 "윤여준이 기획자? 그건 언론의 오보"|website=네이트뉴스|language=ko-KR|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts stated that if positioned as an independent, Ahn would attract a degree of support from those disaffected by mainstream political parties in the wake of corruption allegations and continuing policy failures. 

Ahn's polling was higher than other potential candidates, at 35% with second place coming in at 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nate.com/view/20110905n02597|title=안철수, 서울시장 보선 여론조사서 압도적 선두|website=네이트뉴스|language=ko-KR|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; His approval rating was subsequently polled afterwards, reaching over 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mediatoday.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=97232|title=조국 "안철수에 큰박수" 진중권 "과연 인물"|last=미디어오늘|date=2011-09-06|work=미디어오늘|access-date=2018-05-10|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn eventually didn't run despite his positive poll ratings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://v.media.daum.net/v/20110907084056110|title="아무 조건 없습니다" 안철수 깨끗한 양보|date=2011-09-07|work=다음 뉴스|access-date=2018-05-10|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead endorsing [[Park Won-soon]] who went on to win the by-election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://v.media.daum.net/v/20110907024716274|title=박원순, 안철수 지지율 흡수 여부가 변수|date=2011-09-07|work=다음 뉴스|access-date=2018-05-10|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Park's win has been attributed to Ahn's endorsement due to centrist voters moving to Park's side after the endorsement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=032&amp;aid=0002162450|title=박원순 ‘안철수 지지’ 업고 나경원과 오차내 접전|access-date=2018-05-10|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He alluded to standing as a presidential candidate in his 2012 book ''Thoughts of Ahn Cheol-Soo''.&lt;ref name="Ahn Nominee"&gt;{{cite news|last=Yeong-doo|first=Kang|title=Ahn Cheol-soo to announce his candidancy virtually|url=http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/politics/2012/07/19/0502000000AKR20120719102051001.HTML?template=5565|accessdate=19 July 2012 |newspaper=Yonhapnews |date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First presidential campaign (2012)===
On 19 September 2012, at 3 p.m. [[Korea Standard Time]], Ahn held a press conference and announced his intention to run for the [[South Korean presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]]. This announcement came after months of speculation on whether or not Ahn was going to run for the presidency. The South Korean presidential election was to be held on 19 December 2012. In an address that lasted around 20 minutes, Ahn spent a considerable amount of time explaining how he came to the decision to run for President of the Republic of Korea, quoting the people he had met while exploring his candidacy, who had expressed their desire for a "new politics". Ahn at one point showed to be polling stronger than [[Moon Jae-in]], with a few polls showing he could win against [[Park Geun-hye]], the candidate who would go on to win the election. On 23 November 2012, at 8:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. KST, Ahn announced that he would drop out of the race,&lt;ref&gt;http://news.naver.com/main/president2012/news/read.nhn?mid=hot&amp;sid1=154&amp;cid=909465&amp;iid=39207146&amp;oid=003&amp;aid=0004843794&amp;ptype=011&lt;/ref&gt; endorsing Moon Jae-in, the Democratic United Party presidential candidate.

===Early Assembly career (2013–2016)===
On 11 March 2013, Ahn announced that he would run for a seat in the [[National Assembly of South Korea]]  as an independent candidate in the by-election in the district of [[Seoul]] [[Nowon-gu|Nowon]] C. He won the election on 24 April, entering his first elected office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=전국 12개 재보선 개표 마무리…安·金·李 당선|url=http://news1.kr/articles/1105911|accessdate=24 April 2013|newspaper=News1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, he launched a new think tank named Policy Network Tomorrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=안철수 싱크탱크 출범, 신당 창당 궤도에 올라|url=http://www.newdaily.co.kr/news/article.html?no=155844|accessdate=25 May 2013|newspaper=Newdaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New Politics Alliance for Democracy Chairmanship (2014) ====
Having entered the Assembly, Ahn began to explore the creation of a new party, which was provisionally named the New Political Vision Party on the basis of public surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2985037|title=Ahn’s party to establish new name at gathering|newspaper=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|date=17 February 2014|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 March 2014, however, while the party was in the process of being set up, Ahn merged his faction with the liberal Democratic Party to form the [[New Politics Alliance for Democracy]] (NPAD), becoming co-chairman of the new party alongside [[Kim Han-gil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=2985728|title=Political shocker as DP, Ahn Cheol-soo merge|newspaper=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|date=3 March 2014|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.donga.com/List/3/all/26/407931/1|title=Democratic Party, Ahn Cheol-soo agree to create new party|newspaper=[[The Dong-A Ilbo]]|date=3 March 2014|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn and Kim both resigned from their position three months later in July following the new party's disappointing performance in [[South Korean by-elections, 2014|by-elections that year]], which had seen the liberals lose a seat in [[Jeolla]] to conservatives for the first time in 26 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2992867|title=Co-chairmen quit amid election rubble|newspaper=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|date=1 August 2014|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Defection from the NPAD (2015) ====
Ahn remained in the NPAD, but came into increasing conflict with Moon Jae-in, who had taken over sole leadership of the party after his resignation, and the "pro-Roh" faction that Moon represented. In December 2015, Ahn issued an ultimatum to Moon demanding that a convention be held at the beginning of 2016 to elect a new party leader. Moon rejected the demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=3012565|title=NPAD’s Moon rejects Ahn demand|newspaper=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|date=9 December 2015|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn then left the NPAD along with a range of other lawmakers opposed to Moon, including Kim Han-gil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2015/12/116_193056.html|title=Ahn Cheol-soo calls it quits with NPAD|newspaper=[[The Korea Times]]|date=13 December 2015|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Announcing that he would form a new party, he subsequently joined forces with [[Chun Jung-bae]], who had left the party earlier in the year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150914001156|title=Party feud erodes Moon’s leadership|newspaper=[[The Korea Herald]]|date=14 September 2015|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to form the [[People's Party (South Korea, 2016)|People's Party]] in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tbsefm.seoul.kr/eNews/news.do?method=efmNewsInfo&amp;idx_800=2143018&amp;typ_800=N |title=Ahn Cheol-Soo, Chun Jung-Bae To Create New Party |publisher=TBS eFM |date=25 January 2016 |accessdate=12 April 2016}}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moon resigned as leader after Ahn's defection, describing his experience as "a series of difficult days without a single one of respite".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/728307.html|title=Moon Jae-in steps down as leader of The Minjoo Party of Korea|newspaper=[[The Hankyoreh]]|date=28 January 2016|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's Party (2016–2018)===
Ahn positioned the new [[People's Party (South Korea, 2016)|People's Party]] as an anti-establishment centrist force, attracting support from both political wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/04/116_201981.html|title=Ahn's popularity baffles parties|newspaper=[[The Korea Times]]|date=5 April 2016|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He labeled the remaining NPAD "anachronistic progressives",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160118000971|title=Debate over first President Rhee reignites|newspaper=[[The Korea Herald]]|date=18 January 2016|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accused contemporary Korean politicians of lacking policies beyond "short-term gimmicks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/emanuel-pastreich/the-bernie-sanders-of-kor_b_9211944.html|title=The Bernie Sanders of Korea? An Interview With Ahn Cheol-soo|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=11 February 2016|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lead-up to the [[South Korean legislative election, 2016|April 13 parliamentary election]], he came into conflict with his co-leader Chun and other members of the party after [[Kim Chong-in]], the interim leader of the Democratic Party, the NPAD's successor, called for the two parties to form an electoral alliance. Kim Han-gil and Ahn's co-leader Chun both supported the plan, but Ahn rejected any prospect of an alliance with his former party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/03/116_199827.html|title=Ahn stumbling on internal feud|newspaper=[[The Korea Times]]|date=7 March 2016|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was ultimately scotched, with Kim Han-gil withdrawing from the upcoming election in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/03/116_200609.html |title=Rep.

In the event, the People's Party performed better than anticipated, coming second in [[party-list proportional representation|party-list]] voting and winning 38 seats overall, including 23 of the 28 districts in the liberal stronghold of Jeolla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/739721.html|title=In liberal stronghold, voters give main opposition party a lashing|newspaper=[[The Hankyoreh]]|date=14 April 2016|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The People's Party held the balance of power in the new Assembly, establishing a [[multi-party system|three-party system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160413000614|title=Minority People's Party steals show: Ahn’s Party holds balance of power as three party system dawns|newspaper=[[The Korea Herald]]|date=14 April 2016|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn was credited for the victory, which was seen as giving him a position as [[kingmaker]] and support for contesting [[South Korean presidential election, 2017|the presidential elections in the following year]].&lt;ref name="BloombergKingmaker"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-14/software-tycoon-turns-political-kingmaker-in-korean-stalemate|title=Software Tycoon Turns Political Kingmaker in Korea Stalemate|publisher=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]|date=14 April 2016|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/04/116_202545.html|title=Attention to shift to 2017 presidential race|newspaper=[[The Korea Times]]|date=13 April 2016|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the election, Ahn rejected continued calls to regroup with the Minjoo Party, stating that "it would be inappropriate to speak of politically realigning at this point in time". He added that the People's Party would not be "a mere tie-breaking third party, but ... a new opinion leader in parliamentary affairs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160417000276|title=Ahn gestures at moving onto presidential race|newspaper=[[The Korea Herald]]|date=17 April 2016|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Second presidential campaign and defeat (2017) ====
Ahn was widely known to be a likely contender for the [[South Korean presidential election, 2017|2017 South Korean presidential election]]. He was selected as the People's Party's nominee,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/14/world/asia/south-korea-election-ahn-cheol-soo.html|title=South Korea Election Turns Into 2-Way Race as Dark Horse Surges|last=Sang-hun|first=Choe|date=2017-04-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-15|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; defeating [[Sohn Hak-kyu]] and [[Park Joo-sun]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=079&amp;aid=0003072580&lt;/ref&gt; Despite rapid increase in opinion polling which briefly bypassed [[Moon Jae-in|Moon Jae-In]], Ahn floundered in TV debates that led to his loss finishing third in a field of five total candidates.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;'{{Cite news|url=http://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0101_201705032206263984|title=Ahn And Hong Exchanges 2nd Place In Polling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Return of party chairmanship (2017-2018) ====
The underperformance of his presidential campaign and a party scandal that found People's Party members fabricating evidence to smear Moon Jae-in's campaign led Ahn to declare in July 2017 to both apologize and take a step back from politics in "self-reflection." He returned a month later to run, and later win, the party chairmanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mengnews.joins.com/view.aspx?aId=3037660|title=Ahn Cheol-soo hails his comeback as People’s Party head|website=Korea JoongAng Daily|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bareunmirae Party (2018-present) ===
As head of the People's Party, Ahn was a strong advocate for merging with the center-right Bareun Party. The two leaders of the respective parties, Ahn and former presidential contender [[Yoo Seong-min|Yoo Seung-min]], pushed forward with the merger which was completed in February 2018. 

Although Yoo retained a leadership position within the new party and Ahn stepped down from any leadership role, as of March 2018 took on the role of leading the party's talent recruiting committee - a formal position speculated to signal his preparation to run for the Seoul mayorship later in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20180316000791|title=Parties ready for Seoul mayoral election|last=Herald|first=The Korea|date=2018-03-16|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Seoul Mayorship campaign (2018) ====

==Political positions==

=== "New Politics" ===
Ahn has stated that he considers [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to be a role model,&lt;ref name="BloombergKingmaker" /&gt; and has referred to himself as the [[Bernie Sanders]] of Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/emanuel-pastreich/the-bernie-sanders-of-kor_b_9211944.html|title=The Bernie Sanders of Korea? An Interview With Ahn Cheol-soo|newspaper=The World Post|date=11 February 2016|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supports an increased [[capital gains tax]], higher public welfare spending, and a cautious approach to free trade agreements.&lt;ref name="BloombergKingmaker" /&gt;

=== Centrism ===
Ahn has also made appeals to conservatives, however, and has associated the People's Party with "reformative" currents of Korean conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/04/116_202138.html|title=Ahn backs Yoo to woo conservatives|newspaper=[[The Korea Times]]|date=7 April 2016|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, Ahn visited the graves of [[Syngman Rhee]], [[Park Chung-hee]], and [[Kim Dae-jung]]. Park and Rhee are often praised by Korean conservatives, and Kim by liberals. Ahn stated at the time that it would be "hypocritical to paint half the people as enemies and at the same time call for 'unity{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/552749.html|title=Ahn visits National Cemetery in first political act|newspaper=[[The Hankyoreh]]|date=21 September 2012|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn has been considered "more palatable for conservative voters" in part due to his business background.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== National security (THAAD) ===
Ahn was among the first who opposed the American deployment of the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense]] system, commonly referred to as THAAD, alongside Moon Jae-in. However, he changed his stance suggesting it was "irresponsible" for any future president to reverse an agreement already made between the United States and Korea.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== LGBT rights ===
Ahn has stated he opposes the legalization of [[same-sex marriage]], although in a more detailed article on broadcasting network SBS' website, he said that same-sex marriage needs to be achieved through social discussion.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Philanthropy==
In December 2011, Ahn has expressed his willingness to donate half of his shares in AhnLab for the education of children from low-income families. He owns 37.1 percent of AhnLab shares, and as of 9 December 2011, the value of the shares to be donated is about 250 billion won ($218 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Gwang-bin (광빈) |last = Lee (이) |script-title=ko:안철수 기부주식 2천500억원 넘어 |date = 2011-12-11 |url = http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2011/12/10/0200000000AKR20111210045600001.HTML |work = Yonhap News |accessdate = 2011-12-11 |language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal problems==
In September 2012, Ahn made a public apology as reports surfaced that his wife evaded taxes by under-pricing a 2001 apartment she bought worth ₩450 million to ₩250 million, thus reducing the acquisition and registration taxes by up to ₩10 million.  However, a statement by the Korea Taxpayers' Association claimed that the "down contract" was in accordance with trade customs and thus not unlawful due to flaws in the local tax law between 1996 and 2005.&lt;ref name="ahnkoreaherald"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bae |first=Hyun-jung |title=Ahn apologizes for wife's tax-dodging |newspaper=Korea Herald |publication-place=Seoul |date=28 September 2012 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1988 he married Kim Mi-kyung, who is currently a professor at the Seoul National University College of Medicine. Ahn has a daughter with Kim.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?year=2012&amp;no=610838 {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Big Business''''' is a 1988 American [[comedy film]] starring [[Bette Midler]] and [[Lily Tomlin]] (each playing two roles).  The movie revolves around two sets of [[Twin#Monozygotic (identical) twins|identical female twins]] mismatched at birth, with one of each pair ending in a wealthy urban family (the Sheltons) and the other in a poor rural family (the Ratliffs). It was produced by [[Touchstone Pictures]], with the plot loosely based on ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'' (1589–1594) by [[William Shakespeare]].

The film co-stars [[Fred Ward]], [[Edward Herrmann]], [[Joe Grifasi]], and [[Seth Green]], as well as siblings [[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]] and [[Mary Gross]]. Directed by [[Jim Abrahams]], critical reaction to the film as a whole was generally lukewarm.  Midler received an [[American Comedy Award]] in the category Funniest Actress in a Motion Picture for her performance, in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards for ''Big Business''|work=iMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094739/awards|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
In 1948, wealthy businessman Hunt Shelton and his pregnant wife are lost in rural [[West Virginia]] when Mrs. Shelton goes into labor near the town of Jupiter Hollow. At the local hospital, they are turned away, because it is exclusively for employees of Hollowmade, the local furniture maker. Mr. Shelton purchases the company on the spot, and Mrs. Shelton is then admitted. The Ratliffs, an impoverished couple, arrive moments later with Mrs. Ratliff also in labor. Both women give birth to twin girls, and the elderly nurse attending the doctor confuses and mixes up the sets of twins. Mr. Ratliff overhears the Sheltons deciding to name their daughters Rose and Sadie, and suggests the same names to his wife.

Forty years later, the Shelton sisters are now co-chairwomen of Moramax in [[New York City]], a conglomerate that is the successor to their father's business interests. Sadie Shelton is focused on her career to the detriment of her family, while Rose Shelton wishes for a simpler life in the country. As part of her business plan, Sadie plans to sell Hollowmade, but must get stockholders' approval to proceed. In Jupiter Hollow, Rose Ratliff has risen to the position of forewoman at the Hollowmade Factory, and is also very career-driven. Meanwhile, Sadie Ratliff has always felt misplaced in rural life, and wishes for a more sophisticated life in a big city. Rose discovers Moramax's plans to sell Hollowmade, and makes plans to travel to New York City to stop the sale. Wanting to see the city, Sadie agrees to join her sister.

While Sadie Shelton makes plans for the shareholders' meeting, she learns from her employee Graham Sherbourne that "R. Ratliff" plans to come to New York with his sister to stop the sale. Sadie orders Sherbourne to locate "R. Ratliff" to prevent them from appearing at the meeting. A series of mixups at [[JFK Airport]] leaves the Shelton sisters stranded while the prospective buyer of Hollowmade, Mr. Fabio Alberici, takes their limousine back to the [[Plaza Hotel]] with the Ratliff sisters. The Ratliffs are checked into the Sheltons' suite, and the Sheltons take the suite next door, leading to a series of near-misses between the four sisters, and the men who are pursuing them romantically. In the meantime, Graham and his assistant/boyfriend assume that a visitor from Jupiter Hollow, Rose Ratliff's beau Roone Dimmick, is actually "R. Ratliff."

All sisters discover their mixup in the lobby bathroom. After Sadie Shelton acts like she will call off the Hollowmade sale, Rose Ratliff calls her out on the strip mining plans.  Rose Shelton then realizes that Sadie has been lying to her, and helps the Ratliffs trap her in the broom closet. Rose Ratliff sits outside the broom closet to keep Sadie Shelton trapped, while Rose Shelton and Sadie Ratliff attend the shareholders' meeting and stop the sale of Hollowmade. Both sets of twins later leave the Plaza hotel with their newfound loves.

==Production==
[[File:Plaza Hotel May 2010.JPG|thumb|right|The Plaza and its [[Modernist architecture|International Modern style]] neighbors as seen in the film.]]
The movie was originally written for [[Barbra Streisand]] (Midler's role) and [[Goldie Hawn]] (Tomlin's role). The plot is a coincidental{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} and playful combination of three previously recognizable stories: Aesop's ''[[The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse]]'', Mark Twain's ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]'', and Shakespeare's ''[[Comedy of Errors]]''.

The production company could not get the rights to film at the actual [[Plaza Hotel]] in [[New York City]], so it had the hotel recreated on sound stages. To recoup construction costs, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] built a sitcom called ''[[The Nutt House]]'' around it.  [[Jim Abrahams]] said he staged one of the boardroom scenes based on an experience he had when a large agency used many employees to get him to sign with them.

==Reception==
Critical reaction to the film as a whole was generally lukewarm. The review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 40% of critics gave the film a positive rating, based on 15 reviews, with an average score of 4.9/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Big Business (1988) |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1002310-big_business/ |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate= October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheila Benson]] from ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' called ''Big Business'' a "bright whirligig of a movie" and added: "As you watch its buoyant hilarity, the intricacies flow smoothly as honey off a spoon [...] Like a sensational party the night before, "Big Business" may not bear the closest scrutiny in the cold light of day, but it gives an irresistible glow at the time. And when it gets on a roll, it's a movie with more wit to its lines and a more pungent array of them than much of the mishmash that has passed as Bette Midler's ''Greatest Movie Hits''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-06-10/entertainment/ca-4864_1_big-business|first=Sheila |last=Benson|title=Midler, Tomlin Do a Twin Turn in 'Big Business'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 10, 1988|accessdate= October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' writer [[Ben Yagoda]] felt that the film was "big fun. Lily Tomlin and Bette Midler are a double dose of hilarity. Call out the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] — ''Big Business'' is a laugh riot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.philly.com/1988-06-10/news/26268953_1_big-business-dori-pierson-ruthless-people|first=Ben |last= Yagoda|title=In 'Business' For Big Laughs|work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]]|date=June 10, 1988|accessdate= October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Vincent Canby]] remarked that ''Big Business'', "though it never quite delivers the boffo payoff, is a most cheerful, very breezy summer farce, played to the hilt by two splendidly comic performers [...] Sometimes [the film's writers] do have trouble in characterizing the two sets of twins, allowing them to blend in such a way that the comic edge finally becomes blurred. Yet the film moves at such a clip, and with such uncommon zest, that it's good fun even when the invention wears thin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-06-10/entertainment/ca-4864_1_big-business|first=Vincent |last=Canby |title=A Tomlin-Midler Comedy of Errors|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 10, 1988|accessdate= October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]], writing for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', gave the film two out of four stars. He declared the film "an endless and dreary series of scenes in which the various twins just barely miss running into each other in the Plaza Hotel," and found that it felt "unfinished" and missed a payoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120502/REVIEWS/120509993|first=Roger |last=Ebert|title=The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel|publisher=RogertEbert.com|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date= 2 May 2012|accessdate= 30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film "a shrill, unattractive comedy." The staff felt that Midler's "loud brashness generally dominated [Tomlin's] sly skittishness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/1987/film/reviews/big-business-1200427659/|first=|last=Variety Staff|title=Review: ‘Big Business’|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date= December 31, 1987|accessdate= October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
In the United States, ''Big Business'' debuted within the top three on the [[box office]] chart and became a modest success, eventually grossing $40,150,487 during its domestic run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Wanda' Heads Upstream|publisher= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1989-03-16/entertainment/ca-1688_1_big-business|accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Big Business''|work=The Numbers|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1988/0BBUS.php|accessdate=2009-01-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090211074525/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1988/0BBUS.php| archivedate= 11 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= WEEKEND BOX OFFICE : 'Crocodile' Swamps 'Rambo'; Hanks' 'Big' Hit|publisher= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1988-06-14/entertainment/ca-4175_1_big-business|accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Amaglobeli''' ([[Georgian language|georg]]. დავით ამაღლობელი) is a [[Georgians|Georgian]] economist who was acting president of the [[National Bank of Georgia]] (NBG) between October 2007 and February 2009.

== Biography ==
Amaglobeli was born on August 8, 1976 in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. In 1998 he graduated with a diploma in economics from [[Tbilisi State University]] and in 2001 he received the degree of Master of Science in Economics from [[Oregon State University]]. 

In 1998-1999 David Amaglobeli worked as an economist at the committee of economic policy and reforms at the [[Parliament of Georgia]] and in 1999-2001, in parallel to his graduate studies, he worked as a research/teaching assistant. 

In 2001-02 David Amaglobeli worked as the department head at the ministry of tax revenues of Georgia and in 2002-03 as a consultant to the government of Georgia on fiscal and monetary policy issues for the state commission responsible for the development of poverty reduction and growth program. 

From January 2004 David Amaglobeli worked as a fiscal economist at the [[International Monetary Fund]] local office in Tbilisi and the same year he was appointed as a deputy minister of finance. From March 2005 till October 2009 David Amaglobeli served as a deputy governor and from October 2007 till February 2009 as acting governor of the NBG. 

In his capacity of the governor of the NBG, David Amaglobeli initiated various legislative and institutional reforms. In particular, inflation targeting was adopted as the monetary policy regime, monetary policy committee and main policy interest rate were introduced, a transparent foreign currency auction system was adopted as the main instrument for market interventions. As a result of institutional reforms the size of staff was significantly reduced, and payment systems (cash and cash free) and reserve management reform projects were initiated. 

During David Amaglobeli’s tenure at the NBG, the country experienced severe exogenous shocks. Despite the severe consequences from war with Russia in August 2008 and from the deepening of the global financial crisis in September 2008, the country maintained macroeconomic and banking sector stability.

== Life ==
Dhimitër Mborja was born in [[Mborje]], modern [[Korçë District]] (then part of the [[Manastir Vilayet]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]) in 1884. At the age of sixteen, with his father, Viskë and his brothers emigrated to Bucharest. Their house in Mborje was donated in order to house the Albanian-language school of the village.&lt;ref name="Kotherja"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gazeta-shqip.com/ndryshe/3fc09d99bd85ed29c4329cce9c4855d3.html|title=Delegatët e Kolonisë së Bukureshtit në  Kuvendin e Vlorës|last=Kotherja|first=Niko|date=July 23, 2009|work=Gazeta Shqip|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908 he joined the ''Dituria'' association of Korçë. Mborja emigrated to Bucharest where his name appears as the owner of a "Carpati" club and the leader of the Albanian community there.&lt;ref name="Ymeri"/&gt; On November 5, 1912, he was elected by the Albanian community of Bucharest to become a representative of the Albanians of Romania in the assembly of Vlorë, where he signed the [[Albanian Declaration of Independence]] as "D. Emanuel".&lt;ref name="Elsie"&gt;[http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts20_1/AH1912_1.html 1912 - The Declaration of Albanian Independence (by Robert Elsie)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507000000/http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts20_1/AH1912_1.html |date=May 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;His brother, Pandeli was an adjutant of [[Ismail Qemali]] during that period, while his younger brother, Nuç served under [[Themistokli Gërmenji]]. Mborja also donated 1,000 gold napoleons to the ministry of finances of the provisional government.&lt;ref name="Kotherja"/&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;Mborja as a delegate of the Bucharest colony at the [[Albanian Congress of Trieste]] in 1913.
&lt;br&gt;In 1915 he was elected a councillor of the ''Albanian Orthodox Community of Bucharest'' organization, which also operated an Albanian-language school in the city. In 1919-21 he donated his mansion in Korçë to house the [[Albanian National Lyceum]].&lt;ref name="Kotherja"/&gt; A supporter of [[Fan Noli]], he participated in the 1924 June Revolution that overthrew [[Ahmet Zogu]]'s regime. After Zogu's return, he was self-exiled. Mborja died in 1945 in Bucharest.&lt;ref name="Ymeri"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.albaniapress.com/lajme/9742/diaspora-e-atdhetareve-te-harruar-dhimiter-emanoil-1884-1945.html|title=Diaspora e atdhetarëve të harruar: Dhimitër Emanoil (1884-1945)|last=Ymeri|first=Baki|date=September 7, 2009|publisher=Albania Press|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 27, 1992 he was posthumously awarded the "Medal for Patriotic Activity" ({{lang-sq|Medalje Për Veprimtari Patriotike}}), which was received by his descendants in Korçë.&lt;ref name="Kotherja"/&gt;

'''Douglas Henderson''' (16 July 1935 – 15 September 2006) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[politician]]. He was [[Scottish National Party|Depute Leader of the Scottish National Party]] (SNP) from 1971 to 1973 and from 1979 to 1981. He served as a [[Scottish National Party]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[East Aberdeenshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Aberdeenshire]] from 1974 to 1979, and held virtually every national office in the SNP, short of party leader.  His political style has been described as "no-nonsense"&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5353864.stm | title=Former deputy leader of SNP dies |work=[[BBC News]] |date=17 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "very blunt and forthright".&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/douglas-henderson-416599.html |title=Obituaries: Douglas Henderson.

==Early life and career==
Henderson was born in [[Edinburgh]], the son of a [[Porter (railroad)|railway porter]].&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article2085416.ece |title=Douglas Henderson |work=[[The Times]] |date=19 September 2006 |accessdate=18 June 2016 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won a [[scholarship]] to attend the [[Royal High School, Edinburgh|Royal High School]] and was then awarded a [[bursary]] which allowed him to attend the [[University of Edinburgh]] from 1952 to 1957. He graduated from Edinburgh with an [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|MA]] and an [[Bachelor of Laws|LLB]].&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt;

He worked as a [[management consultant]] in the UK and overseas.&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt; He married Maureen Ferguson in [[Johannesburg]] in 1960 and had four children, but they were later divorced.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt; In later life, his home and business partner was English fashion designer Betty Davies; together, they founded [[Scottish Fashion International]].&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt;

In later years, he regularly attended [[St Giles Cathedral]], where his funeral was held on 7 October 2006.&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt;

==Political career==

=== Early career (1970–1983)===
Henderson became a supporter of [[Scottish independence]] at an early age, and joined the SNP aged 14.&lt;ref name="scotsman obituary"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/douglas-henderson-1-1141217 |title=Douglas Henderson |work=The Scotsman |date=19 September 2006 |accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was President of the Edinburgh University Nationalist Club.&lt;ref name="Herald 18Sep2006"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12421981.SNP_pays_tribute_as_veteran_nationalist_Douglas_Henderson_dies_at_71/ |title=SNP pays tribute as veteran nationalist Douglas Henderson dies at 71 |work=The Herald |date=18 September 2006 |accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson became heavily involved with the SNP after he returned to Scotland from South Africa in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/sep/26/guardianobituaries.obituaries1 |title=Obituary:Douglas Henderson. SNP chief whip happy to bring down Labour at any price |first=Brian |last=Wilson |authorlink=Brian Wilson (Labour politician) |work=[[The Guardian]] |date= 26 September 2006 |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the director of programmes for [[Radio Free Scotland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Gazetteer for Scotland |title =Douglas Henderson | url =http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst3201.html  | accessdate = 24 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1963 to 1965, and was Senior vice-chairman (depute leader) of the SNP from 1970 to 1972,.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; He was selected as the SNP candidate for [[East Aberdeenshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Aberdeenshire]] in 1972, and moved to live in the constituency, developing links with local fishermen, farmers and businessmen.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; He was elected at the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]], and re-elected in the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October general election]] later that year.  The SNP were in the ascendent, campaigning on the basis of "[[North sea oil|It's Scotland's oil]]".&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

Henderson served as the [[whip (politics)|whip]] and was a leading member of the group of 11 SNP MPs in the House of Commons.  In 1975, he negotiated a position for the SNP's [[Winnie Ewing]] in the British delegation to the [[European Parliament]],&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; where she became known as "Madame Ecosse".  He was later the SNP spokesman on employment and industry.  He was instrumental in the SNP's decision to lay down a censure motion in the House of Commons, criticising the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of [[James Callaghan]] after 1 March 1979 referendum vote on [[Scottish devolution]] failed to be approved by the required 40% of the electorate.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; At the time, the Labour government were reliant upon support from the SNP.  The motion was carried by one vote on 28 March and Callaghan immediately called the general election which brought the Conservative Party led by [[Margaret Thatcher]] to power.  Callaghan described the actions of the SNP as "[[turkeys voting for Christmas]]".&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Henderson lost his seat to Conservative [[Albert McQuarrie]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]] by less than 600 votes, and only two MPs from the SNP remained in the new Parliament.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

He returned to his business career, but with less success than the 1960s.&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt; At the SNP Conference in 1979, he was elected the party's Senior vice-chairman (now described as deputy leader) (to leader [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]]), defeating [[Margo MacDonald]] for the post.  He remained in this position until 1981, when he stood down on health grounds.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

He fought the new seat of [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]], which had largely replaced Aberdeenshire East in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]], again losing to Albert McQuarrie by less than 1,000 votes. Future SNP leader [[Alex Salmond]] would represent this constituency from 1987, and it has since become a somewhat safe SNP seat with four-figure majorities over the [[Conservative and Unionist Party]].  He also suffered in his private life, being divorced in the early 1980s.

===Later revival (1998–2006)===
He was out of active politics for a long period as a result of misdiagnosed illness.  He had a major operation in 1998 for cancer, and then several months of [[chemotherapy]], before he was able to resume his political duties for the SNP.&lt;ref name="scotsman obituary"/&gt;

He contested the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (United Kingdom)|2004 European Parliament election]] for the SNP but was not elected as he was placed fourth on the party's list and they gained only two seats. He also contested the [[Dumfries and Galloway (UK Parliament constituency)|Dumfries and Galloway]] seat at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], finishing third behind [[Russell Brown (Scottish politician)|Russell Brown]], the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate and [[Peter Duncan (British politician)|Peter Duncan]] the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2005/html/684.stm |title=Election 2005. Result: Dumfries and Galloway |work=[[BBC News]] |date=6 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, following the retirement of [[Winnie Ewing]], he stood for the post of SNP President, polling 129 votes (30.00%) {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} compared to 235 votes (54.65%) for [[Ian Hudghton]], [[Member of the European Parliament]], and 66 votes (15.35%) for onetime president [[William Wolfe]]. He was however successful in being elected as one of six ordinary members of the SNP's National Executive Committee.

He was selected to fight the [[Falkirk East (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Falkirk East]] constituency for the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007]], and was ranked fourth on the SNP's [[Central Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Central Scotland]] regional list. He died after a short illness in 2006, before the election could take place.&lt;ref name="snp"&gt;[http://www.snp.org/news/snp_press_release.2006-09-16.6195726594 SNP pay tribute to Douglas Henderson]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, SNP press release, 16 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Energen is enriched with SIGMAVit with [[milk]], [[malt]], [[cereal]] and [[oats]]. In [[Indonesia]], it was manufactured as oat milk (like [[Quaker Oats]]). In the [[Philippines]], it was manufactured as a mixture of oat drink and real [[fruit]] called Energen Go-Fruit in 2014, though it was discontinued in 2015.

'''Fugazi''' ({{IPAc-en|f|u|ˈ|g|ɑː|z|i}}; {{Respell|foo|GAH|zee}}) is an American [[punk rock]] band that formed in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1987. The band consists of guitarists and vocalists [[Ian MacKaye]] and [[Guy Picciotto]], bassist [[Joe Lally]] and drummer [[Brendan Canty]].

Fugazi are noted for their unique sound, blending of elements of [[dub music|dub]]/[[reggae]] with high energy rock and [[punk rock|punk]]/[[Hardcore punk|hardcore]]-styled guitars, as well as for their business practices&lt;ref name="stillinrock.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stillinrock.com/2014/03/anachronique-fugazi-war-punk.html |title=Brooklyn based Music Blog: Anachronique : Fugazi (War Punk) |publisher=Still in Rock |date=2004-02-26 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contempt towards the music industry.&lt;ref name="Fugazi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=fugazi |title=Fugazi |publisher=TrouserPress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band, and others from the punk and hardcore scene leading up to the early 1990s, were among the early adopters of what grew to be known as the [[DIY ethic]].

Fugazi have performed numerous worldwide tours, produced six studio albums, a film and a comprehensive live series, gaining the band critical acclaim and success around the world.&lt;ref name="guitarworld"/&gt; Fugazi has been on an indefinite hiatus since 2003.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1986–1989)===
After the [[hardcore punk]] group [[Minor Threat]] dissolved, Ian MacKaye (vocals and [[guitar]]) was active with a few short-lived groups, most notably [[Embrace (American band)|Embrace]]. MacKaye decided he wanted a project that was "like [[The Stooges]] with [[reggae]]", but was wary about forming another band after Embrace's break up. MacKaye recalled, "My interests were not necessarily to be in a band, but to be with people who wanted to play music with me."&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

MacKaye recruited ex-[[Dag Nasty]] [[drummer]] [[Colin Sears]] and [[bass guitar]]ist Joe Lally, and the trio began practicing together in September 1986. After a few months of rehearsals, Sears returned to Dag Nasty and was replaced by Brendan Canty (earlier of [[Rites of Spring]]). One day Canty's Rites of Spring bandmate [[Guy Picciotto]] dropped by during a practice session to see how his friend was getting along; he later admitted he secretly harbored the idea of joining the group. But Picciotto was disappointed that there seemed to be no place for him.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;

After some uncertainty from Canty about what he wanted to do with his future, the trio regrouped and booked their first show at the Wilson Center in early September 1987. The group still needed a name, so MacKaye chose the word "fugazi" from Mark Baker's ''Nam'', a compilation of stories of [[Vietnam War]] veterans, it there being a slang acronym for "Fucked Up, Got Ambushed, Zipped In [into a body bag]".&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt;

The band began inviting Picciotto to practices. Inspired by use of a [[Hype man|foil]] in [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], Picciotto sang backup vocals. After his band [[Happy Go Licky]] broke up, he became more involved with Fugazi. MacKaye eventually asked Picciotto to become a full member, which he accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Fugazi EP'' &amp; ''Margin Walker''&amp;nbsp;– ''13 Songs'' (1988–1989)===
Fugazi embarked on its first tour in January 1988. In June 1988 the band recorded its debut EP ''[[Fugazi (EP)|Fugazi]]'' with producer [[Ted Niceley]] and producer/engineer [[Don Zientara]] (who would become a long-time collaborator), and shortly afterwards embarked on an arduous tour of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the tour's conclusion in December, the band recorded songs for its intended debut album. However, the band was spent from touring and decided that the resulting sessions were unsatisfactory. The track list was cut down to an EP and released as ''[[Margin Walker]]'' the following year. Both EPs were eventually combined into the ''[[13 Songs (Fugazi album)|13 Songs]]'' release in late 1989.&lt;ref name="stillinrock.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the band's return from Europe, Picciotto, unsatisfied with singing, began playing guitar too.&lt;ref name="Azerrad, p. 399"&gt;Azerrad, p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Repeater'' and ''Steady Diet of Nothing'' (1990–1992)===

|format=[[Ogg]]}}
With Picciotto playing guitar full-time, Fugazi made the transition into [[Jam session|jamming]] and writing new material as a band as opposed to performing songs composed solely by MacKaye. In addition to working on new material, songs they had been performing live were refined, such as "Merchandise" and "Turnover", for inclusion on their first official full-length studio album.&lt;ref name="Perlah, Jeff 2002"&gt;^ a b c d Perlah, Jeff. "The Independent". Guitar World. March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Released on April 19, 1990, through [[Dischord Records]], ''[[Repeater (album)|Repeater]]'' did not initially reach the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts or become a commercial success. However, the band spent most of 1990 and 1991 touring heavily behind ''Repeater'', performing a total of 250 concerts between March 1990 and June 1991, routinely selling out 1,000-plus capacity venues throughout the world. By summer 1991, the album sold more than 300,000 copies, a large number for a label that relied on minimal promotion. While major labels began to court Fugazi, the band decided to stay with  [[Dischord Records|Dischord]] and  refused the offers of those labels. ''Repeater'' ultimately went on to sell more than 1 million copies in the U.S. alone, and more than 2 million worldwide. The album was critically well received and featured an [[alternative rock]] sound that pre-dated significant releases such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[Nevermind]]'' and [[Pearl Jam]]'s ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]'', which would unexpectedly go on to break the genre into the mainstream.&lt;ref name="Perlah, Jeff 2002"/&gt;

For Fugazi's second studio-album ''[[Steady Diet of Nothing]]'', released in July 1991, the band once again asked [[Ted Niceley]] to produce. Niceley had become a chef and had to reluctantly turn down the job, so the band members decided to produce the record themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of ''Repeater'' and its subsequent world tour, ''Steady Diet'' was highly anticipated, six months prior to its release [[Dischord Records|Dischord]] had pre-orders in excess of 160,000 for the album.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last1=Andersen |first1=Mark |last2=Jenkins |first2=Mark |year=2001 |title=Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation's Capital |location=New York |publisher=Akashic Books |isbn=1-888451-44-0}} p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

===''In On the Kill Taker'' and ''Red Medicine'' (1993–1996)===
Fugazi recorded its third album ''[[In on the Kill Taker]]'' in the fall of 1992 with [[Steve Albini]] in Chicago; however, the results were deemed unsatisfactory and the band re-recorded the album with [[Ted Niceley]] &amp; [[Don Zientara]]. With the breakthrough of [[alternative rock]] in the early 1990s, ''In on the Kill Taker''; released on June 30, 1993, became the group's first record to enter the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' album charts, received critical praise from ''[[Spin magazine|Spin]]'', ''[[TIME magazine]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', sold 180,000 copies in its first week of release and subsequently became the band's breakthrough album.&lt;ref name="guitarworld" /&gt;

By the ''In on the Kill Taker'' tour, the group began to sell-out large auditoriums and arenas, as well as receive more lucrative major label offers. During the band's sold-out 3-night stint at New York City's [[Roseland Ballroom]] in September 1993, music mogul and [[Atlantic Records]] president [[Ahmet Ertegün]] met with the band backstage in an attempt to sign them. Ertegün offered the band "anything you want", their own subsidiary label and more than $10 million just to sign with Atlantic. Fugazi declined the offer.&lt;ref&gt;Freidman, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The organizers of [[Lollapalooza]] also attempted to recruit the band for a headlining slot on its 1993 tour, which the band considered but ultimately turned down.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Norman|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Listen
|filename=Fugazi_-_Combination_Lock.ogg
|title="Combination Lock"

|format=[[Ogg]]}}
Fugazi began writing the material for ''[[Red Medicine]]'' in late 1994, after touring in support of ''[[In on the Kill Taker]]''. The band worked with engineer [[Don Zientara]], but did not choose to work with producer [[Ted Niceley]] again. Fugazi opted to retreat from the in-your-face production values of ''In on the Kill Taker'' and instead worked to create an ambient sound which would display greater range and depth. To achieve this, the band handled production duties themselves, and in doing so, became more confident with in-studio experimentation. ''Red Medicine'' would take Fugazi a step further toward [[art rock]]. The band began an extensive worldwide tour in support of the album, playing a total of 172 shows between March 1995 and November 1996.&lt;ref name="guitarworld" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===''End Hits'' and ''The Argument'' (1997–2002)===
After the grueling worldwide tour the band had completed in support of ''Red Medicine'', Fugazi took an extended break and also began writing material for a follow up release. By March 1997 Fugazi had once again returned to Inner Ear Studios with producer/engineer [[Don Zientara]] to begin recording what would become the ''[[End Hits]]'' album with the intention of taking a more relaxed approach to recording and a longer amount of time to experiment with different songs and techniques in the studio. The group ultimately spent 7 months recording the album. Due to the title, rumors began circulating at the time that it was to be their last release.&lt;ref name="Morphizm"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.morphizm.com/recommends/fugaziguy.html| title=Guy Picciotto of Fugazi:The Argument (2001): Interview | work=Morphizm | publisher=Morphizm.com | accessdate=2009-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Released on April 28, 1998 the album was commercially successful and marked one of the band's highest debuts yet on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]]. However, critical reaction to ''End Hits'' was mixed. Many critics praised the album's heavier tracks, while others questioned the inclusion of the group's longer, more experimental songs.&lt;ref name="Crane, Larry 1999"&gt;Crane, Larry.

Fugazi began work on ''[[The Argument]]'' in 1999. This process saw the group taking more time than usual to write and demo material. Each member would bring his own individual riffs and ideas to the band, jam on them, and then begin piecing the songs together into various configurations before deciding on what would become the final versions.&lt;ref name="Pitchfork"&gt;{{cite web|first=Chip|last=Chanko|year=2002|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/5840-fugazi/| title=Interviews:Fugazi|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]|accessdate=2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album's recording sessions took place between January and April 2001 at [[Inner Ear Studios]] and Dischord House in [[Arlington, VA]], located just outside [[Washington D.C.]] The band once again worked with producer/engineer [[Don Zientara]]. During the recording process a considerable amount of time was spent finalizing each song's production, in particular the album's drum tracks, in an effort to give it a unique feel.&lt;ref name="Modern Drummer"&gt;Perlah, Jeff. (2005). [http://www.moderndrummer.com/site/2004/05/brendan-canty/ Brendan Canty]. Modern Drummer Magazine.com. Retrieved 4/28/11.&lt;/ref&gt; Drummer [[Brendan Canty]] explained to ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' that "We recorded them all very differently in terms of the drum sounds. We used a lot of different cymbals, snares, and ways of miking."&lt;ref name="Modern Drummer"/&gt;

''The Argument'' was released by [[Dischord Records]] on October 16, 2001, along with the EP [[Furniture + 2]], almost 4 years after the release of ''[[End Hits]]''. The album was met with critical and commercial success entering the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' charts and selling over 170,000 copies in its first week of release. Arion Berger of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called the album "bracing" and "intellectual"&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Arion. [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/the-argument-20011113 Fugazi The Argument] Rollingstone.com. Retrieved 4/28/11.&lt;/ref&gt; and Chris True of ''[[AllMusic]]'' referred to the album as "spine-tingling and ear-shattering all at once" stating that, "the band has raised the bar for themselves and others once again." He also noted that the album had "touched on strange new territory."&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Allmusic ((( ''Steady Diet of Nothing'' &gt; Review )))|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r343128|author=Kellman, Andy|accessdate=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this point Fugazi were on tour less frequently, due in large part to other professional and personal commitments, they performed only 32 shows in 2001 and 2002 respectively.&lt;ref name="guitarworld"&gt;Perlah, Jeff. "The Independent". ''Guitar World''. March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indefinite hiatus and reunion rumours (2003–present)===
Fugazi went on what they have called an "indefinite hiatus" after the conclusion of their 2002 UK tour following 3 sold-out nights at the [[London Forum]] in [[England]] on November 2, 3, 4, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Freidman, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The hiatus was brought on by the band members' insistence on spending more time with their families and to pursue other professional projects.&lt;ref&gt;Freidman, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Fugazi went on hiatus in 2003, rumors began circulating regarding a possible reunion, with some insinuating that the band may get back together to headline the [[Coachella Festival]]. While the band has confirmed that they have been offered large sums of money to reunite and headline festivals, such as Coachella, they have so far declined the offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/25590 |title=Brendan Canty discusses Fugazi hiatus, "Burn to Shine" and new projects |publisher=Punknews.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, MacKaye reiterated that Fugazi has "been offered insane amounts of money to play reunions, but it’s not going to be money that brings us back together, we would only play music together if we wanted to play music together and time allowed it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://approachingoblivion.blogspot.com/2011/03/ian-mackaye-interview-minor-threat.html |title=Approaching Oblivion: Ian Mackaye Interview (Minor Threat, Fugazi, Dischord Records) |publisher=Approachingoblivion.blogspot.com |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, when asked by ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' about the possibility of a reunion and a follow up to 2001's ''[[The Argument]]'', bassist [[Joe Lally]] stated that "''The Argument'' was a great record that we should try and top. It’ll take some time to come together and everything. To do that, we’d have to, the way the four of us are, we would take quite some time, I think, re-associating ourselves musically, and then just letting it come about naturally, because it would have to be a natural thing. So we’ll just see."&lt;ref name="Interview: Joe Lally"/&gt;

In August 2014, Dischord announced an official release for ''[[First Demo]]'', an album featuring 11 demo songs recorded in January 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dischord.com/news/580/2014/8/fugazi-first-demo-out-this-winter|title=Fugazi "First Demo" Out November 18th|publisher=Dischord.com|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement included a preview of the demo for the Fugazi track "Merchandise." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1714496/fugazi-merchandise-demo/mp3s/|title=Fugazi – "Merchandise" (Demo) - Stereogum|work=Stereogum|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eleven-track album was released on November 18, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dischord.com/release/181/first-demo|title=Fugazi - First Demo|work=Dischord Records|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacKaye insists Fugazi is not, in fact, broken up. While he admits any future public performance will have to contend with various confounding factors, the members have occasionally played music together, privately, since their 2002 hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.culturecreature.com/fugazi-reunion/ |title=Fugazi's still around--they just went underground |publisher=culturecreature.com |date=2017-01-19 |accessdate=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 21, 2018, in a new interview on Vish Khanna's Kreative Kontrol podcast, Fugazi bassist Joe Lally revealed that the band still occasionally gets together to play. Lally begins, “Yeah, when we’re all in D.C., we totally hang out together and talk and spend a lot of time laughing. We have a great time together, go out to dinner, and we’ll play some music together.” He then shoots down any hopes of a potential reunion: “There’s so much to try to look after to allow Fugazi to do anything, that we do not have the time to give it the respect that it deserves. So unfortunately, it is where it is.”

==Side projects and related work==
In the hiatus, the members undertook side projects, with MacKaye forming the duo [[The Evens]] with drummer and singer [[Amy Farina]] (formerly of [[the Warmers]]).

In 2004, MacKaye produced the ''[[DC EP]]'' for former [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] guitarist [[John Frusciante]], which also featured Jerry Busher.

Canty has been doing a variety of soundtrack scores and playing bass in the trio [[Garland Of Hours]] alongside frequent Fugazi guest contributors Jerry Busher and Amy Domingues, and has played bass live with [[Mary Timony]]. Canty also appears on [[Bob Mould]]'s 2005 album ''[[Body of Song]]'' and on Mould's 2008 album ''[[District Line (album)|District Line]]'', and has toured with Mould, appearing in the live DVD ''Circle of Friends''. He is currently working in the [[Burn to Shine (DVD series)|Burn to Shine]] DVD series which is being released by Trixie DVD. Now, he is playing in Deathfix alongside Devin Ocampo (Medications, Faraquet, Smart Went Crazy, Beauty Pill), Rich Morel (Bob Mould, Blow Off) and Mark Cisneros (Medications, The Make-Up). They will release their album in February 2013 on [[Dischord Records]].

Lally has released three solo albums, ''[[There to Here]]'' (2006), ''[[Nothing Is Underrated]]'' (2007), and ''[[Why Should I Get Used To It]]'' (2011). He has also appeared on fellow DC post-punkers [[Decahedron]]'s debut album ''Disconnection_Imminent'', as well as on a project with [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] guitarists [[John Frusciante]] and [[Josh Klinghoffer]], known as [[Ataxia (band)|Ataxia]].  The group has recorded two albums, ''[[Automatic Writing]]'' (2004) and ''[[AW II]]'' (2007).

Picciotto currently works as a record producer most notably with [[Blonde Redhead]] and [[The Blood Brothers (band)|The Blood Brothers]], and he has performed alongside members of [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]] at the [[Jazz]] festival in [[Wels]], [[Austria]]. Picciotto also contributed guitar on two [[Vic Chesnutt]] albums, 2007's "[[North Star Deserter]] and 2009's ''[[At the Cut]]'' (co-producing the latter), for [[Constellation Records (Canada)|Constellation Records]] and performed live with Chesnutt and members of [[Thee Silver Mount Zion Memorial Orchestra]] and The Quavers in [[Jem Cohen]]'s program entitled, "Evening's Civil Twilight in Empires of Tin at the [[Vienna International Film Festival]] (Viennale) in 2007 (a DVD of the program was released in 2009).  Picciotto played guitar on Chesnutt's Fall/Winter 2009 North American Tour. He has a daughter with musician [[Kathi Wilcox]] from the band [[Bikini Kill]] and [[The Frumpies]].

In July 2011, Minneapolis based record label [[Doomtree]] released an album of mash-ups between Fugazi and east coast veteran rap crew the [[Wu-Tang Clan]]. The album is titled 13 Chambers, group name Wugazi. However, Fugazi itself did not have any involvement with the release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/wugazis-13-chambers-a-track-by-track-breakdown-20110713?asid=98b65563 |title=Wugazi's '13 Chambers': A Track-by-Track Breakdown |work=Rolling Stone |date=July 13, 2011|author=Joe Gross |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bassist Joe Lally was asked about his thoughts on the Wugazi release, and stated "I think they could've found better Fugazi pieces to sample with Wu-Tang guys rapping on it. I mean, it’s enjoyable, and I do appreciate it for the fact that somebody enjoys our music enough to bring it into that. But, you know, I don’t know. I guess I should shut up, because I suppose I'm about to run into these people at the [[Fun Fun Fun Fest]] festival and talk to them. But I’m afraid that is my opinion on it. It's like, get better samples of our stuff, do better work."&lt;ref name="Interview: Joe Lally"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/chicago/articles/joe-lally,64410/ |title=Interview: Joe Lally |publisher=The A.V. Club Chicago |date=2011-11-10 |accessdate=2011-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, Chris Lawhorn released ''Fugazi Edits''. The album includes 22 instrumental tracks, which sample 100 songs from Fugazi's discography.&lt;ref name="Cool Hunting: Fugazi Edits"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coolhunting.com/culture/fugazi-edits-by-chris-lawhorn.php |title=Fugazi Edits |publisher=Cool Hunting |date=2013-01-23 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in other cases, the band had no involvement in the production. But, the album was authorized for release by MacKaye, with the proceeds going to charity.&lt;ref name="Creators Project"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecreatorsproject.com/blog/ifugazi-editsi-is-the-ultimate-mashup-album-combining-up-to-five-tracks-in-one |title=Fugazi Edits is the Ultimate Mash-up Album |publisher=Creators Project |date=2012-11-30 |accessdate=2012-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108051108/http://thecreatorsproject.com/blog/ifugazi-editsi-is-the-ultimate-mashup-album-combining-up-to-five-tracks-in-one |archivedate=2012-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Canty and Lally joined with guitarist Anthony Pirog to form [[the Messthetics]], Canty and Lally's first project together since Fugazi's hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.dischord.com/images.d/press_release/filename/35/DIS186_PRESS.pdf |title=Press Release: The Messthetics |publisher=Dischord Records |date=2018-03-23 |accessdate=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2018, the Messthetics released their self-titled debut album and embarked upon a tour of the US and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-messthetics-the-messthetics/ |title=The Messthetics: The Messthetics |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] |date=2018-03-31 |accessdate=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Fugazi Live Series}}
[[File:Fugazi guns - Stierch.jpg|thumb|Handmade tickets for a Fugazi concert from 2001 in Indianapolis, Indiana]]
Between 1987 and 2003, Fugazi played over 1000 concerts in all 50 US states and all over the world. Over 800 of these shows were recorded by the band's sound engineers. Beginning in 2004 and continuing into 2005, Fugazi launched a 30 CD Live Series that featured concerts from various points in their career, which were made available for sale via [[Dischord Records]]. Continuing with the live series concept and after several years of development on December 1, 2011 Fugazi launched a comprehensive Live Series website through Dischord Records that features 750 recordings available for download at the suggested price of $5 each or a "[[pay what you want]]" sliding scale option for each download between $1–100 with the goal of eventually making all 800 of the shows that have been recorded available for purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series|title=Fugazi Live Series: A to Z|publisher=Dischord.com|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For $500 fans can also purchase an "All Access" privilege which will include access to any future concerts and downloads added to the site.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/arts/music/fugazi-live-series-a-post-punk-bands-archive-of-shows.html |title=Fugazi Rises Again, In Online Archive |publisher=New York Times |date=2011-11-25 |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While each concert was professionally mastered, the recordings capture everything that happened onstage and for preservation's sake the band chose not to edit anything out, singer/guitarist [[Guy Picciotto]] explained to the ''[[New York Times]]'', "We liked this idea of, 'Let's just let it be everything,' ... There doesn't have to be the idea that this is the great, golden document. It's all there, and it's not cleaned up. You get what you get." The sound quality also varies as the earliest recordings were made to [[Compact Cassette|cassette]]s, then eventually digital formats such as [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]], [[CD-R]] and ultimately hard-drives were used. Each concert page also includes flyers, photographs and ticket stubs. As a career-spanning archival project, the Fugazi Live Series has few equals, putting the band in the company of acts like the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Phish]] and [[Pearl Jam]], three notable examples of other artists with such a large volume of concerts available for purchase.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt;

Fugazi combined [[punk rock|punk]] with [[funk]] and [[reggae]] beats, irregular stop-start song structures, and heavy riffs inspired by popular rock bands such as [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]], bands that the [[punk rock|punk]] community of the time largely disdained.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, p. 391–392.&lt;/ref&gt;

Picciotto became the group's second guitarist when he realized MacKaye's typically chunky, low-end riffs and Lally's [[dub music|dub]]-influenced basslines allowed him to focus on high-pitched parts. In both vocal and guitar roles, Picciotto assumed the role of a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to MacKaye; employing a [[Rickenbacker]] guitar for its scratchy single-coil sound in order to "cut through MacKaye's chunky chording like a laser beam."&lt;ref name="Azerrad, p. 399"/&gt; Picciotto's assumption of guitar duties allowed all four members of the band to jam together and write songs that way, where previously they had played songs largely as MacKaye had arranged them.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, p. 399–400.&lt;/ref&gt; When writing songs, the band often rearranges them with different structures and different singers.&lt;ref name="guitarworld" /&gt; ''[[Spin Magazine]]'' has listed MacKaye and Picciotto together at No.&amp;nbsp;86 on their list of The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time for their unique and interlocking guitar style in Fugazi.&lt;ref name="Spin Magazine 100 Greatest Guitarists"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/05/spins-100-greatest-guitarists-all-time/?page=1 |title=SPIN's 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time |publisher=Spin.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, MacKaye's lyrics and singing are more direct and [[anthem]]ic (MacKaye admits that he loves audience sing-alongs and writes songs with shout-able [[slogan]]s), while Picciotto usually favors a more abstract, oblique approach.&lt;ref name="guitarworld" /&gt; Lally has contributed vocals to a few songs as well, in which he sings in a more relaxed, quiet style as opposed to MacKaye and Picciotto, whose lyrics and vocals often feature strong emotional intensity. Later, Fugazi more fully integrated elements of punk rock, hardcore, [[soul music|soul]] and [[noise rock|noise]] with an inventively syncopated [[rhythm section]]. Notable is MacKaye and Picciotto's inventive, interlocking guitar playing, which often defies the traditional notion of "[[lead guitar|lead]]" and "[[rhythm guitar|rhythm]]" guitars. They often feature unusual and dissonant [[Chord (music)|chords]] and [[chord progression|progressions]] filtered through a hardcore punk lens.

When questioned by ''[[Guitar World]]'' in 2002 about the band's influences, singer/guitarist [[Ian MacKaye]] responded, "Too many to mention. And not just from the last few years. Some of them predate us by decades, and most of them wouldn't be punk. I would hope any musician would be inspired by a lot of different kinds of music."

Joe Strummer (the lead vocalist of the Clash) recognized Fugazi as the only band who best exemplified punk's spirit in the 2000 Rolling Stone interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation’s Capital|last1=Andersen|first1=Mark|last2=Jenkins|first2=Mark|date=2003|publisher=Akashic Books|year=|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of Fugazi's albums since ''[[Repeater (album)|Repeater]]'' have featured an [[instrumental rock|instrumental]] song. By the time of 1995's ''[[Red Medicine]]'' bassist [[Joe Lally]] also began contributing vocals to the band and the group was implementing many of their broader influences into the overall sound. Critics Ian McCaleb and Ira Robbins declared that Fugazi's music combined an "unprecedented dynamic range ... and previously unimagined elements" such as "clattering [[musique concrète]] ... [[piano]] and [[sound effect]]s ... murky [[Dub music|dub]] and lancing [[clarinet]]" and "loose-limbed [[jam band|jammy]] [[funk]] ... into an ambitious, experimental format that raises more stylistic questions than it answers."&lt;ref name="Fugazi"/&gt;

Bands who have cited Fugazi as an influence include [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Refused (band)|Refused]], [[At the Drive-In]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Quicksand (band)|Quicksand]], [[Deftones]], [[Iceage (band)|Iceage]], [[NOFX]], [[Redencion 911|Redención 911]], [[Bad Religion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fugazi is a benchmark, a signpost and an example of how it could and should be done|url=http://www.westword.com/music/fugazi-is-a-benchmark-a-signpost-and-an-example-of-how-it-could-and-should-be-done-5680146|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blink-182]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIVE BANDS THAT INFLUENCED BLINK-182|url=http://www.trieyecreative.com/list-five-bands-that-influenced-blink-182.html|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[the Offspring]], [[Bikini Kill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=50 Greatest Bands of All Time|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qK2SnZnMMaoC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=bands+influenced+by+fugazi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZdUM1yYK2Q&amp;sig=m4EBs3zjelU4TZSzbT0qITkFTi4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjM_fi1zdLZAhWKAsAKHYxGAXI4ChDoAQhIMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=bands%20influenced%20by%20fugazi&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 March 2018|publisher=SPIN}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lorde]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lorde's Fugazi, Mars Volta, and PJ Harvey-Influenced High School Band Recordings Surface|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/56219-lordes-fugazi-mars-volta-and-pj-harvey-influenced-high-school-band-recordings-surface/|website=Pitchfork|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pearl Jam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edgar|first1=Elton|title=Six Underrated 90's Bands That Should Be in the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame|url=https://spinditty.com/artists-bands/Five-90s-Bands-Destined-For-The-Rock-Roll-Hall-of-Fame|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business practices==
On their first tours, Fugazi worked out its [[Do it yourself|DIY]] ethic by trial and error. The group's decisions were partly motivated by pragmatic considerations that were essentially a punk rock version of [[simple living]]: for example, selling merchandise on tour would require a full-time merchandise salesperson who would require lodging, food, and other costs, so Fugazi decided to simplify their touring by not selling merchandise. The band was also motivated by moral or ethical considerations: for example, Fugazi's members regarded pricey admission for rock concerts as tantamount to [[price gouging]] a performer's most loyal fans. Fugazi's inexpensive target goal of $5 admission was spawned during a conversation on an early tour when the band's members were debating the lowest profitable admission price.&lt;ref name="punklives"&gt;[http://www.oocities.org/drawcamp/wp93.htm]  {{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years and at many venues, particularly on the east and west coasts of the U.S., Fugazi was unable to get ticket prices below about $10–$15 total. However, it never saw the $5 rule as inviolable, instead aiming to charge a price that was both affordable and profitable. Unlike some similar, independent rock contemporaries, Fugazi's performances and tours were always profitable, due to the group's popularity, low business overhead costs, and MacKaye's keen sense of audience response in given regions.&lt;ref name="punklives" /&gt;

Fugazi's early tours earned it a strong word-of-mouth reputation, both for its powerful performances, and also for the band's eagerness to play in unusual venues. The group sought out alternatives to traditional rock clubs partly to relieve the boredom of touring, but also hoping to show fans that there are other options to traditional ways of doing things. As Picciotto said, "You find the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks Lodge]], you find the guy who's got a space in the back of his pizzeria, you find the guy who has a gallery. Kids will do that stuff because they want to make stuff happen."&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group (MacKaye in particular) also made a point of discouraging violent, unwanted [[slam dancing]] and fistfights, which it saw as relics of the late 1970s/early 1980s [[hardcore punk]] era. [[Michael Azerrad]] quotes Mackaye, "See, [slam dancers] have one form of communication: violence ... So to disorient them, you don't give them violence. I'd say, 'Excuse me, sir...'- I mean, it ''freaks'' them out – 'Excuse me, sir, would you please cut that crap out?'"&lt;ref name="Azerrad, p. 392"&gt;Azerrad, p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; Azerrad writes, "[MacKaye's] admonitions seemed preachy to some. And by and large, people would obey – it wasn't cool to disrespect Ian MacKaye."&lt;ref name="Azerrad, p. 392"/&gt; Occasionally, Fugazi would have an unrepentant slam-dancer escorted from the concert, and give them an envelope containing a $5 refund (the group kept a stock of such envelopes in their tour van for these occasions).

During the summer of 1990 MacKaye formed the corporation Lunar Atrocities Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mblr.dc.gov/corp/lookup/status.asp?id=165796]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306133611/http://mblr.dc.gov/corp/lookup/status.asp?id=165796 |date=March 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to shield his own and his bandmates' personal assets from the threat of lawsuits. As MacKaye's financial advisor, Seth Martin, explained to the ''Washington Post'' in a 1993 interview: "protection from liability is the main reason to form a corporation, and for these guys it makes sense. If someone got hurt stage-diving and decided to sue, it would be harder to go after their personal assets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/drawcamp/wp93.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 27, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/drawcamp/wp93.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+21:05:41 |archivedate=October 25, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cost per Genome.png|thumb|Since the [[Human Genome Project]] first sequenced the [[human genome]] from 1987 to 2004 at a cost of US$ 3 billion, costs have fallen precipitously, outpacing even [[Moore's law]], and were ≈US$1,000 in 2015. More widely available genome sequencing has led to more data on variants of uncertain significance.]]

The human genome consists of three billion [[DNA]] [[nucleotides]], which have been described in the [[Human Genome Project - Read]] program, 95% completed in 2004. 
Examples of goals of GP-Write include making cell lines that are resistant to all viruses and synthesis assembly lines to test [[variants of unknown significance]] that arise in research and diagnostic sequencing of human genomes (which has been exponentially improving in cost, quality and interpretation).&lt;ref name="SCI-20160602" /&gt;

'''Gerald John Howard Carroll''' (born 1951) is a British businessman. He was the head of his family business the [[Carroll Group]], once one of the largest private companies in the United Kingdom, until it collapsed in the early 1990s, leading to his bankruptcy.

==Early life and family==
Gerald Carroll was born in 1951&lt;ref&gt;[http://companycheck.co.uk/director/901410182/MR-GERALD-JOHN-HOWARD-CARROLL GERALD JOHN HOWARD CARROLL.] Company Check. Retrieved 16 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; in the Romford district of Essex.&lt;ref&gt;"England &amp; Wales births 1837-2006 Transcription", findmypast.co.uk Retrieved 16 April 2015. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the son of John Carroll (born around 1929).&lt;ref name=Sun/&gt; His grandfather was John E. Carroll who built homes for workers at the [[Ford Dagenham|Ford factory in Dagenham]]. Carroll claims descent from the Anglo-Irish [[Carroll family]] who have been prominent in American politics and one of whom was the sole Catholic signatory to the [[American Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;"How did this man's 500m world wide business empire vanish into thin air?", Dan Atkinson, ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'', 5 November 2000, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll was educated at the independent [[Ipswich School]].

==Career==
Carroll took control of the family business in the late 1970s&lt;ref name=sunday&gt;"Party ends as property meteor crashes to earth", John Waples, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 26 February 1995, pp. 2 &amp; 7.&lt;/ref&gt; but claimed in an interview with Sky News to be self-made.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXRnQ4NWPwg&lt;/ref&gt; He launched a bid for quoted car dealership Frank G. Gates in 1985&lt;ref&gt;"Company News in Brief: Frank G. Gates", ''[[The Times]]'', 16 January 1985, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; but specialised in spotting property development sites and obtaining planning permission for them.&lt;ref name=sunday/&gt;

In 1995, Carroll was made bankrupt after the failure of the Carroll Group.&lt;ref name=Sun&gt;" 'Bully' son banned by tycoon", John Kay &amp; Bill Coles, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', 13 January 1996, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
In 1990, Carroll agreed to endow a chair of Irish history for £1.5m at [[Hertford College]], University of Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lsfavCLaaE Sky News.] You Tube. Retrieved 16 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His bankruptcy however prevented him from supplying all of the agreed funding.

The '''HSA Foundation''' is a [[not-for-profit]] engineering organization of industry and academia that works on the development of the [[Heterogeneous System Architecture]] (HSA), a set of royalty-free computer hardware specifications, as well as [[open-source software|open source]] [[software development]] tools needed to use HSA features in application software.

The HSA Foundation aims to develop and define features and interfaces for various types of computer processors, including [[Central processing unit|CPUs]], [[GPU|graphics processors]], [[Digital signals processor|DSPs]]; as well as the [[computer memory|memory]] systems that connect these. The resulting architecture, HSA, aims to make it easier to program [[parallel computing|parallel]] systems built from heterogeneous combinations of these devices.&lt;ref name="whitepaper"&gt;{{Cite report |author=George Kyriazis |date=30 August 2012 |title=Heterogeneous System Architecture: A Technical Review |url=http://amd-dev.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wordpress/media/2012/10/hsa10.pdf |publisher=AMD}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

The HSA Foundation was founded by [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]], [[ARM Holdings]], [[Imagination Technologies]], [[MediaTek]], [[Qualcomm]], [[Samsung]] and [[Texas Instruments]]. Further members include licensors and licensees of [[semiconductor intellectual property]], developers of [[Central processing unit|CPUs]], [[Graphics processing unit|GPUs]], [[Digital signal processor|DSPs]] and [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s (ASICs) based upon own and/or licensed technology, academic partners such as the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] and the [[University of Bologna]], and the not-for-profit engineering organization [[Linaro]]. The HSA Foundation has itself joined the [[Linux Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/575673/ |title=HSA Foundation joins Linux Foundation |date=2013-12-04 |accessdate=2014-05-07 |work=[[LWN.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bowie Hau Chi-keung''' ({{zh-t|侯志強}}; born 1956) is a [[Indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories (Hong Kong)|rural leader]] and businessman in Hong Kong. He is the current chairman of the Sheung Shui Rural Committee, ex officio executive committee member of the [[Heung Yee Kuk]] and ex officio member of the [[North District Council]].

==Family and early life==
Hau is born in Ho Sheung Heung, [[Sheung Shui]], [[New Territories]] in Hong Kong into the Hau clan, one of the five great clans in the New Territories in 1956. His father was a sailor and his mother was a farmer. He was the eldest of seven siblings. Hau got a job as a dockworker when he was just 13 and was convicted of theft when he was 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=鄉委會主席頂證簡炳墀　自稱曾勸勿做犯法事　選舉要公平|newspaper=Apple Daily|date=21 November 2011|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/news/art/20111021/15725493}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fight"/&gt;

Hau travelled around Britain, the Netherlands and the United States for 10 years. He opened a Chinese restaurant in Chicago when he was 20 and later made his fortune by buying and selling restaurants.&lt;ref name="fight"/&gt; He returned to Hong Kong in the 1980s and started a business exporting goldfish and bloodworms which brought him HK$1 million per month. He later turned into property.&lt;ref name="fight"/&gt;

==Political career==
Hau had been the indigenous inhabitant representative of Ho Sheung Heung from 1999 until 2011, when he ran as a resident representative of the same village in the village representative election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.had.gov.hk/rre/chi/images/elections_1115/sheungshui.pdf|title=SHEUNG SHUI DISTRICT RURAL COMMITTEE |work=Hong Kong government}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a village representative, Hau sat on the Sheung Shui Rural Committee and became chairman of the rural committee since 2007. As the chairman of the rural committee, he has also been ex officio member of the [[North District Council]].

In 2011, he defeated [[horse trainer]] [[Brian Kan]] by 44 to 16 votes to retain his post as chairman. Kan was later found out engaging in corrupt conduct during an election. It was revealed in the court that Hau had recorded some of Kan's meetings in which the bribery was taken place and even had a video recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bribery trial hears of fierce political rivalry|newspaper=China Daily|date=21 October 2011|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hkedition/2011-10/21/content_13944952.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hau is a vociferous supporter of the government's controversial plans to establish a new town in northeast New Territories. His clan owns 93 hectares of land in [[Kwu Tung]] North, and would receive more than HK$5&amp;nbsp;billion in compensation for development. He had also declared repeatedly that even the Hau clan's ancestral hall could be sold for the right price. Hau dismisses farmers who refuse to vacate the land as unscrupulous squatters.&lt;ref name="fight"&gt;{{cite news|title=It's our right, say New Territories leaders fighting to keep small-house policy|url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/article/1545665/its-our-right-say-new-territories-leaders-fighting-keep-small|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sued by an 85-year-old farmer Lau Oi-kiu in 2015 of dumping waste on her farmland in Ho Sheung Heung to drive her off in 2009. Hau was branded "contemptuous of the law" and had to pay Lau HK$1.41&amp;nbsp;million in compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elderly Hong Kong woman wins compensation after rural leader, property agent try to push her off own farmland|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/1763347/rural-leader-and-hong-kong-property-agent-ordered-pay-hk14m#comments|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the chairman of the Sheung Shui Rural Committee, Hau is an ex officio executive committee member of the [[Heung Yee Kuk]], a powerful organ which oversees 600 villages and 1,500 village chiefs and represents the rural interests. He fiercely attacks calls for the government to end its [[Small House Policy]], which allows male descendents of indigenous residents to apply to build a village house of up to three-storeys, on a site of no more than 700 square feet, without paying a premium for conversion of land use.&lt;ref name="fight"/&gt; He also once called middle-aged professionals who have yet to own property as "useless basketcases" which caused public uproar.&lt;ref name="fight"/&gt;

In 2015, Hau planned to form a new political party with other like-minded rural leaders independent from the Kuk for the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2016|2016 Legislative Council election]], due to his dissatisfaction over the Kuk's handling of the case of 11 [[Sha Tin]] villagers selling their own land rights under the Small House Policy for profit. He also dissatisfied with the [[pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing allies]] which he argued that they had not always spoken up for the villagers' interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong rural leader Hau Chi-keung hopes new party will win four seats in coming Legco election|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1903583/hong-kong-rural-leader-hau-chi-keung-hopes-new-party-will|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his plan was opposed by other faction in the Kuk. The inauguration ceremony of the [[New Progressive Alliance]] was cancelled in the last minute. He later quit the [[Liberal Party (Hong Kong)|Liberal Party]] and ran as an independent in the election.

'''Henry Chakava''' (born 26 April 1946) is a [[Kenya]]n publisher. He has focused on the publication of books particularly in [[East Africa]] and has been called "the father of Kenyan publishing".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-tkyk8Q4gI "JSO INTERVIEW, HENRY CHAKAVA, 23RD MAY PART 1"], YouTube, 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wanjala |first1=chris |title=Going down memory lane with doyen of publishing |url=https://www.nation.co.ke/lifestyle/weekend/Going-down-memory-lane-with-doyen-of-publishing/1220-3133954-10yykwk/index.html |work=Daily Nation |issue=25 March 2016 |language=en-UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his contribution to educational and cultural literature in his region, he has received several awards.

== Life ==
Henry Miyinzi Chakava&lt;ref&gt;"Chakava, Henry Miyinzi", in ''Africa Who's Who'', London: Africa Journal for Africa Books Ltd, 1981, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Vokoli]], [[Vihiga District]]. He began his career after completing his study in [[literature]] and [[philosophy]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Chakava, [http://www.bellagiopublishingnetwork.com/newsletter25/chakava.htm "Dealing with the British"], ''BPN Newsletter'', Issue No 25, July 1999, Bellagio Publishing Network.&lt;/ref&gt; First he was editor and subsequently chief editor in [[Nairobi]] of the international publishing house [[Heinemann Educational Books]], where he was involved in the publication and promotion of high-profile African writers including [[Ali Mazrui]], [[Chinua Achebe]], [[Marjorie Oludhe Macgoye]], [[Meja Mwangi]], [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]] and [[Okot p'Bitek]].&lt;ref name="PCA"&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://princeclausfund.org/en/network/user/id/238 profile]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCFCV"&gt;Prince Claus Awards (2006) {{cite web|url=http://www.princeclausfund.org/en/what_we_do/awards/documents/HenryChakavaCV.pdf |title=CV |accessdate=2013-02-23 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705022106/http://www.princeclausfund.org/en/what_we_do/awards/documents/HenryChakavaCV.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OBU"&gt;Oxford Brookes University, [http://www.brookes.ac.uk/about/honorary/profiles/henry_chakava biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Chakava took over the Kenyan establishment and went further under the name East African Educational Publishers. Later, he expanded his business with establishments in [[Uganda]] and [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref name="PCA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OBU" /&gt;

He published a great number of educational and cultural books that have had a major importance in eastern Africa. For instance, he published the school books for primary and tertiary education that signified an important renewal in view of the subjects that were written from an African perspective. Previously, school books had been influenced greatly by a Western viewpoint.&lt;ref name="PCA" /&gt;

Also in the cultural field, Chakava came with innovating publications. Besides books in the [[English language]], he published in local languages, at a time when local languages were still seen by governments and authorities as state subversive. Furthermore he published books with a critic stance on local governments. Challenging the boundaries of the [[freedom of expression]], he took great risks and in fact, was repeatedly threatened.&lt;ref name="PCA" /&gt;

Moreover, he took the lead over the African Publishing Institute, and maintained contacts with important publishers in [[Oxford]], [[England]], such as the African Books Collective and Bellagio Publishing Network. Henry Chakava is also a visiting lecturer at the [[Oxford Brookes University]].&lt;ref name="PCA" /&gt;

He is the author of the 1996 book ''Publishing in Africa: One Man's Perspective'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanbookscollective.com/authors-editors/henry-chakava Henry Chakava page] at African Books Collective.&lt;/ref&gt; for which Chinua Achebe wrote a brief introduction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kenyanpoet.com/2013/03/30/remembering-chinua-achebe-dr-henry-chakava/ "Remembering Chinua Achebe; Dr.Henry Chakava"], ''Kenya Poet'', 30 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate Henry Chakava's 70th birthday, a number of key personalities in the publishing world have authored a book, '''''Coming of Age: Strides in African Publishing''''', published by East African Educational Publishers Ltd, Nairobi Kenya. The new release, published in April 2016, is a collection of essays in honour of Dr Henry Chakava @70. 

== Recognition ==
Chakava received several awards. Here follows a selection:&lt;ref name="PCFCV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OBU" /&gt;

A '''Hollander beater''' is a machine developed by the Dutch in 1680 to produce [[paper]] pulp from cellulose containing plant fibers.  It replaced [[stamp mill]]s for preparing pulp because the Hollander could produce in one day the same quantity of pulp it would take a stamp mill eight days to prepare.&lt;ref name="Clapp"&gt;

[[File:Hollander beater.gif|Hollander beater patent|thumb]]

However, the wooden paddles and beating process of a stamp mill produced longer, more easily hydrated, and more fibrillated cellulose fibers; thus increasing the resulting paper's strength. The Hollander used metal blades and a chopping action to cut the raw material, resulting in shorter cellulose fibers and weaker paper. Further, the metal blades of the Hollander often introduced metal contaminants into the paper as one metal blade struck another. These contaminants often acted as catalysts for oxidation that have been implicated in browning of old paper called [[foxing]].&lt;ref name="Clapp"/&gt;

In turn, the Hollander was (partially) replaced by the [[conical refiner]] or Jordan refiner, named after its American inventor Joseph Jordan, who patented the device in 1858.&lt;ref name="Clapp"/&gt;

[[File:Hollander beater.jpg|A Hollander beater|thumb]]

A Hollander beater design consists of a circular or ovoid water raceway with a beater wheel at a single point along the raceway. The beater wheel is a centrifugal compressor or radial impeller cylinder parallel to a grooved plate,&lt;ref name=lumiainen2000refining&gt;{{cite book|chapter=4: Refining of chemical pulp|last1=Lumiainen|first1=J|title=Papermaking Part 1|isbn=952521608X|page=98|date=2000|url=http://www.fing.edu.uy/iiq/maestrias/icp/materiales/2010/06_Papermaking/book8chapter4refining%20of%20chemical%20pulp.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- full book table of contents: http://www.tappi.org/oldtappi/content/pdf/bookstore/0202fin08.pdf --&gt; similar to the construction of a [[water wheel]] or timing pulley. Under power, the blades &lt;!-- "blades" would generally denote cutting not beating--&gt; rotate to beat the fiber into a usable pulp slurry.  The beater wheel and plate do not touch, as this would result in cutting. The distance between the two is adjusted to increase or decrease the pressure on the fibers  when passing through the beater.

The objective of using a beater (rather than another process like grinding, as many [[Wood pulp#Manufacture of wood pulp|wood-pulp]] mills do) is to create longer, hydrated, fibrillated fibers. (Fibrillated fibers are abraded to the extent that many partially broken-off fibers extend from the main fiber, increasing the fiber's surface area, and hence its potential for [[hydrogen bond]]ing). Grinding of fibers is not desirable. Therefore, the "blades" are not what might be thought of as "sharpened," and well-designed beaters make it possible to minimize the shear action of the rotating blades against the bottom of the water raceway.&lt;!-- this statement can be eliminated by replacing the word blades, with a more accurate description --&gt;

'''Industrial fermentation''' is the intentional use of [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] by [[microorganism]]s such as [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] as well as eukaryotic cells like [[Cho cells|CHO cells]] and [[insect cell culture|insect cells]], to make products useful to humans. Fermented products have applications as [[food]] as well as in general [[industry]]. Some commodity chemicals, such as [[acetic acid]], [[citric acid]], and [[ethanol]] are made by fermentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yusuf Chisti|editor1-last=Robinson|editor1-first=Richard K.|title=Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology|date=1999|publisher=Academic Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-12-227070-3|pages=663–674|url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/~ychisti/FermentInd.PDF|ref=Chisti1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of fermentation depends on the concentration of microorganisms, cells, cellular components, and enzymes as well as temperature, pH&lt;ref name="Fermentation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/dept/chem-eng/Biotech-Environ/SeniorLab/Fermentation/ |title=Fermentation |publisher=Rpi.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for [[Evolution of aerobic fermentation|aerobic fermentation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5RUMRF5jpIUC&amp;pg=PA103 |title=Introduction to Biochemical Engineering – Dubasi Govardhana Rao |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; oxygen. Product recovery frequently involves the concentration of the dilute solution. Nearly all commercially produced enzymes, such as [[lipase]], [[invertase]] and [[rennet]], are made by fermentation with [[genetic engineering|genetically modified microbes]]. In some cases, production of biomass itself is the objective, as in the case of [[baker's yeast]] and lactic acid bacteria [[starter cultures]] for cheesemaking. In general, fermentations can be divided into four types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanbury|first1=Peter F.|last2=Whiitaker|first2=Allan|last3=Hall|first3=Stephen J.|title=Principles of Fermentation Technology|date=1999|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=978-0750645010|edition=Second|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Principles_of_Fermentation_Technology.html?id=UGdyQgAACAAJ|ref=Stanbury1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Production of biomass (viable cellular material)
*Production of extracellular metabolites (chemical compounds)
*Production of intracellular components (enzymes and other proteins)
*Transformation of substrate (in which the transformed substrate is itself the product)

These types are not necessarily disjoint from each other, but provide a framework for understanding the differences in approach. The organisms used may be bacteria, yeasts, molds, algae, animal cells, or plant cells. Special considerations are required for the specific organisms used in the fermentation, such as the dissolved [[oxygen]] level, nutrient levels, and [[temperature]].

==General process overview==
In most industrial fermentations, the organisms or eukaroyotic cells are submerged in a liquid medium; in others, such as the fermentation of [[cocoa bean]]s, [[coffee]] cherries, and [[miso]], fermentation takes place on the moist surface of the medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/~ychisti/FermentInd.PDF |format=PDF |title=Fermentation (Industrial) |publisher=Massey.ac.nz |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wurm2004&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wurm FM |title=Production of recombinant protein therapeutics in cultivated mammalian cells |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=22 |issue=11 |pages=1393–1398 |date=2004 |doi=10.1038/nbt1026 |pmid=15529164}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are also industrial considerations related to the fermentation process. For instance, to avoid biological process contamination, the fermentation medium, air, and equipment are sterilized. Foam control can be achieved by either mechanical foam destruction or chemical anti-foaming agents. Several other factors must be measured and controlled such as pressure, temperature, agitator shaft power, and viscosity. An important element for industrial fermentations is scale up. This is the conversion of a laboratory procedure to an industrial process. It is well established in the field of industrial microbiology that what works well at the laboratory scale may work poorly or not at all when first attempted at large scale. It is generally not possible to take fermentation conditions that have worked in the laboratory and blindly apply them to industrial-scale equipment. Although many parameters have been tested for use as scale up criteria, there is no general formula because of the variation in fermentation processes. The most important methods are the maintenance of constant power consumption per unit of broth and the maintenance of constant volumetric transfer rate.&lt;ref name="Fermentation"/&gt;

===Phases of growth===
[[image:Bacterial growth en.svg|250px|right|thumb|Bacterial growth curve\Kinetic Curve]]
When a particular organism is introduced into a selected growth medium, the medium is inoculated with the particular organism.  Growth of the inoculum does not occur immediately, but takes a little while.   This is the period of adaptation, called the lag phase.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.ifr.ac.uk/bacanova/project_backg.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029205637/http://www.ifr.ac.uk/bacanova/project_backg.html |date=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the lag phase, the rate of growth of the organism steadily increases, for a certain period—this period is the log or exponential phase.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  After a certain time of exponential phase, the rate of growth slows down, due to the continuously falling concentrations of nutrients and/or a continuously increasing (accumulating) concentrations of toxic substances. This phase, where the increase of the rate of growth is checked, is the deceleration phase.  After the deceleration phase, growth ceases and the culture enters a stationary phase or a steady state. The biomass remains constant, except when certain accumulated chemicals in the culture lyse the cells (chemolysis). Unless other micro-organisms contaminate the culture, the chemical constitution remains unchanged. If all of the nutrients in the medium are consumed, or if the 
concentration of toxins is too great, the cells may become [[senescence|scenescent]] and begin to die off. The total amount of biomass may not decrease, but the number of viable organisms will decrease.

===Fermentation medium===
The microbes or eukarytic cells used for fermentation grow in (or on) specially designed [[growth medium]] which supplies the nutrients required by the organisms or cells. A variety of media exist, but invariably contain a carbon source, a nitrogen source, water, salts, and micronutrients. In the production of wine, the medium is grape must. In the production of bio-ethanol, the medium may consist mostly of whatever inexpensive carbon source is available.

Carbon sources are typically sugars or other carbohydrates, although in the case of substrate transformations (such as the production of vinegar) the carbon source may be an alcohol or something else altogether. For large scale fermentations, such as those used for the production of ethanol, inexpensive sources of carbohydrates, such as [[molasses]], [[corn steep liquor]],&lt;ref name="CORN STEEP LIQUOR IN MICROBIOLOGY"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=180696 | pmid=16350125 | volume=12 | issue=4 | title=Corn Steep Liquor in Microbiology. | date=Dec 1948 | journal=Bacteriol Rev | pages=297–311 | last1 = Liggett | first1 = RW | last2 = Koffler | first2 = H}}&lt;/ref&gt; sugar cane juice, or sugar beet juice are used to minimize costs. More sensitive fermentations may instead use purified [[glucose]], [[sucrose]], [[glycerol]] or other sugars, which reduces variation and helps ensure the purity of the final product. Organisms meant to produce enzymes such as [[beta galactosidase]], [[invertase]] or other amylases may be fed starch to select for organisms that express the enzymes in large quantity.

[[nitrogen fixation|Fixed nitrogen]] sources are required for most organisms to synthesize [[proteins]], [[nucleic acid]]s and other cellular components. Depending on the enzyme capabilities of the organism, nitrogen may be provided as bulk protein, such as soy meal; as pre-digested polypeptides, such as [[peptone]] or [[tryptone]]; or as ammonia or nitrate salts. Cost is also an important factor in the choice of a nitrogen source. Phosphorus is needed for production of [[phospholipids]] in cellular membranes and for the production of [[nucleic acid]]s. The amount of phosphate which must be added depends upon the composition of the broth and the needs of the organism, as well as the objective of the fermentation. For instance, some cultures will not produce secondary metabolites in the presence of phosphate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/ebooks/archive/free/BK9780854046065/BK9780854046065-00001.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202194708/http://www.rsc.org/ebooks/archive/free/BK9780854046065/BK9780854046065-00001.pdf |date=December 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growth factors and trace nutrients are included in the fermentation broth for organisms incapable of producing all of the vitamins they require. [[Yeast extract]] is a common source of micronutrients and vitamins for fermentation media. Inorganic nutrients, including [[trace element]]s  such as iron, zinc, copper, manganese, molybdenum and cobalt are typically present in unrefined carbon and nitrogen sources, but may have to be added when purified carbon and nitrogen sources are used. Fermentations which produce large amounts of gas (or which require the addition of gas) will tend to form a layer of foam, since fermentation broth typically contains a variety of foam-reinforcing proteins, peptides or starches. To prevent this foam from occurring or accumulating, [[antifoaming agent]]s may be added. Mineral buffering salts, such as carbonates and phosphates, may be used to stabilize pH near optimum. When metal ions are present in high concentrations, use of a [[chelator|chelating agent]] may be necessary.

==Production of biomass==
[[Microbial]] [[cell (biology)|cell]]s or [[biomass]] is sometimes the intended product of fermentation. Examples include [[single cell protein]], [[bakers yeast]], [[lactobacillus]], [[E. coli]], and others. In the case of single-cell protein, [[algae]] is grown in large open ponds which allow photosynthesis to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alfalaval.com/industries/industrial-fermentation/algae-harvesting/pages/algae-harvesting.aspx |title=Algae harvesting – Industrial fermentation – Separators |publisher=Alfalaval.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the biomass is to be used for inoculation of other fermentations, care must be taken to prevent [[mutation]]s from occurring.

==Production of extracellular metabolites==
[[Metabolite]]s can be divided into two groups: those produced during the growth phase of the organism, called '''primary metabolites''' and those produced during the stationary phase, called '''secondary metabolites'''. Some examples of primary metabolites are [[ethanol]], [[citric acid]], [[glutamic acid]], [[lysine]], [[vitamin]]s and [[polysaccharide]]s. Some examples of secondary metabolites are [[penicillin]], [[cyclosporin A]], [[gibberellin]], and [[lovastatin]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

===Primary metabolites===
[[Primary metabolite]]s are compounds made during the ordinary metabolism of the organism during the growth phase. A common example is ethanol or lactic acid, produced during [[glycolysis]]. Citric acid is produced by some strains of ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' as part of the [[citric acid cycle]] to acidify their environment and prevent competitors from taking over. Glutamate is produced by some '' [[Micrococcus]] '' species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15965888 | volume=50 | issue=6 | title=Studies on the amino acid fermentation. Part 1. Production of L-glutamic acid by various microorganisms. | date=Dec 2004 | journal=J Gen Appl Microbiol | pages=331–43 | last1 = Kinoshita | first1 = S | last2 = Udaka | first2 = S | last3 = Shimono | first3 = M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some '' [[Corynebacterium]] '' species produce lysine, threonine, tryptophan and other amino acids. All of these compounds are produced during the normal "business" of the cell and released into the environment. There is therefore no need to rupture the cells for product recovery.

===Secondary metabolites===
[[Secondary metabolite]]s are compounds made in the stationary phase; penicillin, for instance, prevents the growth of bacteria which could compete with ''[[Penicillium]]'' molds for resources. Some bacteria, such as ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' species, are able to produce [[bacteriocin]]s which prevent the growth of bacterial competitors as well. These compounds are of obvious value to humans wishing to prevent the growth of bacteria, either as [[antibiotic]]s or as [[antiseptic]]s (such as [[gramicidin S]]). Fungicides, such as [[griseofulvin]] are also produced as secondary metabolites.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Typically secondary metabolites are not produced in the presence of glucose or other carbon sources which would encourage growth,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; and like primary metabolites are released into the surrounding medium without rupture of the cell membrane.

In the early days of the biotechnology industry, most [[biopharmaceutical]] products were made in ''[[E. coli]]''; by 2004 more biopharmaceuticals were manufactured in eukaryotic cells, like [[Cho cells|CHO cells]], than in microbes, but used similar [[bioreactor]] systems.&lt;ref name="Wurm2004"/&gt;  [[Insect cell culture]] systems came into use in the 2000s as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drugmand|first1=JC|last2=Schneider|first2=YJ|last3=Agathos|first3=SN|title=Insect cells as factories for biomanufacturing.|journal=Biotechnology Advances|date=2012|volume=30|issue=5|pages=1140–57|doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2011.09.014|pmid=21983546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production of intracellular components==
Of primary interest among the intracellular components are microbial [[enzyme]]s: [[catalase]], [[amylase]], [[protease]], [[pectinase]], [[glucose isomerase]], [[cellulase]], [[hemicellulase]], [[lipase]], [[lactase]], [[streptokinase]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=De Lourdes|first1=Maria |last2=Polizeli |first2=T. M. |last3=Rai |first3=Mahendra |title=Fungal Enzymes |date=2013 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-466-59454-8 |url=https://www.crcpress.com/Fungal-Enzymes/Polizeli-Rai/p/book/9781466594548}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recombinant proteins, such as [[insulin]], [[hepatitis B vaccine]], [[interferon]], [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]], [[streptokinase]] and others are also made this way.&lt;ref name=Wurm2004/&gt; The largest difference between this process and the others is that the cells must be ruptured (lysed) at the end of fermentation, and the environment must be manipulated to maximize the amount of the product. Furthermore, the product (typically a protein) must be separated from all of the other cellular proteins in the lysate to be purified.

==Transformation of substrate==
Substrate transformation involves the transformation of a specific compound into another, such as in the case of [[phenylacetylcarbinol]], and [[steroid]] [[biotransformation]], or the transformation of a raw material into a finished product, in the case of food fermentations and sewage treatment.

Ancient fermented food processes, such as making [[bread]], [[wine]], [[cheese]], [[curds]], [[idli]], [[dosa]], etc., can be dated to more than [[5th millennium BC|seven thousand years ago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-94-011-7691-0_24#page-1 |title=Industrial Fermentation: Principles, Processes, and Products |date= |accessdate=2015-06-02 |doi=10.1007/978-94-011-7691-0_24 |journal=Riegel's Handbook of Industrial Chemistry |pages=916–986|year=1992 |last1=Humphrey |first1=Arthur E |last2=Lee |first2=S. Edward |isbn=978-94-011-7693-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were developed long before man had any knowledge of the existence of the [[microorganism]]s involved. Some foods such as [[Marmite]] are the byproduct of the fermentation process, in this case in the production of [[beer]].

===Ethanol fuel===
{{main article|Ethanol fuel}}
Fermentation is the main source of ethanol in the production of [[ethanol fuel]]. Common crops such as sugar cane, potato, cassava and corn are fermented by yeast to produce ethanol which is further processed to become fuel.

===Sewage treatment===
{{main article|Sewage disposal}}
In  the process of sewage treatment, sewage is digested by enzymes secreted by bacteria. Solid organic matters are broken down into harmless, soluble substances and carbon dioxide. Liquids that result are disinfected to remove pathogens before being discharged into rivers or the sea or can be used as liquid fertilizers.  Digested solids, known also as sludge, is dried and used as fertilizer.  Gaseous byproducts such as methane can be utilized as [[biogas]] to fuel electrical generators.  One advantage of bacterial digestion is that it reduces the bulk and odor of sewage, thus reducing space needed for dumping. The main disadvantage of bacterial digestion in sewage disposal is that it is a very slow process.

===Agricultural feed===
A wide variety of agroindustrial waste products can be fermented to use as food for animals, especially ruminants. Fungi have been employed to break down cellulosic wastes to increase protein content and improve ''in vitro'' digestibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=173313796008 |title=Biodegradation of agroindustrial wastes by Pleurotus spp for its use as ruminant feed |doi=10.2225/vol9-issue3-fulltext-2 |publisher=Redalyc.org |date= |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''InvenTrust Properties, Inc.''' (formerly '''Inland American Real Estate Trust, Inc.''' [Inland American]) was the largest non-traded [[real estate investment trust]] (REIT)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20140130/FREE/140139988/huge-nontraded-reit-getting-liquid],“Huge non-traded REIT getting liquid?,” Investment News, January 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States with over $9 billion raised.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1528985/000089262614000184/ireit-supp8.htm] Inland Real Estate Income Trust, Inc.

By 2015, after spinning off a number of its hotel holdings, Inland American's value had fallen 60%, and its dividends were cut by 75%. That year, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' called the trust a "Zombie REIT".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/latest-fear-for-property-investors-zombie-reits-1427221093|title=Property Investors’ Latest Horror: Zombie REITs|date=March 24, 2015|access-date=May 16, 2018|author=Robbie Whelan|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, trust president Tom McGuinness renamed the fund '''InvenTrust Properties, Inc.'''&lt;ref name=Pure&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpexecutive.com/post/pure-play-inventrusts-tom-mcguinness-goes-all-in-on-retail/|title=Pure Play.

==Structure==
The firm is a non-traded REIT, which is a company whose shares are not listed on an exchange. The shares are therefore relatively [[illiquid]].&lt;ref name=Damocles /&gt; Shares were sold through [[broker-dealers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20140302/REG/303029991/once-mighty-nontraded-reit-sponsor-inland-real-estate-investment]“Once-mighty nontraded REIT sponsor Inland Real Estate Investment Corp. plots a comeback,” Investment News, March 2,2014.&lt;/ref&gt; While original investors bought in at $10/share,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20140130/FREE/140139988/huge-nontraded-reit-getting-liquid],“Huge non-traded REIT getting liquid?,” Investment News, January 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Inland American estimated its shares had a value of $4.00 by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Inland American cuts NAV after asset sale|url=http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20150226/FREE/150229922/inland-american-cuts-nav-after-asset-sale|publisher=Investment News|date=Feb 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1307748/000119312513486436/d651145d8k.htm] Inland American Form 8-K&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2012, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] investigated Inland American's administration and fees, concluding the investigation in 2015 without recommending charges. The week the investigation was closed, Inland American became a plaintiff an ongoing lawsuit with its former business management firm as the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20150331/FREE/150339980/sec-drops-investigation-of-inland-american-but-giant-reit-raises-new|title=SEC drops investigation of Inland American but giant REIT raises new questions over fees|author=Bruce Kelly|work=Investment News|date=March 31, 2015|access-date=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the firm announced that functions performed by its external, related-party managers would now be performed by the REIT itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.com/irweblinkx/News.aspx?IID=4098709&amp;mode=1&amp;type=]"Inland American Real Estate Trust, Inc. Reaches Important Milestone – Signs Agreements to Become Self-Managed,"Inland American Press Release, March 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The firm has charged its investors over $1.4 billion in fees and expenses to pay for services provided by these external, related-party managers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=inland+american&amp;owner=exclude&amp;action=getcompany] Inland American Forms 10-K and 2014 Q2 10-Q&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been observed that Inland American “bought a lot of property at the height of the market."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140322/ISSUE01/303229979/whats-in-store-for-inland-reit-shareholders]“What’s in store for Inland REIT shareholders?,” Investment News, March 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Liquidity and spin-off===
Ten years after Inland American’s formation, original investors still had only limited options for [[liquidity]]. To date,{{when|date=January 2015}} Inland American has not announced any special distributions of proceeds from nearly $2.5 billion in assets already sold,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0001307748&amp;type=10-K&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=exclude&amp;count=40] Inland American Form 10-K&lt;/ref&gt; nor does it intend to distribute proceeds from the announced sale of its $1.1 billion select-service hotel portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.com/irweblinkx/News.aspx?IID=4098709&amp;mode=1&amp;type=]"Inland American Announces Sale of Select Service Hotel Portfolio for $1.1 Billion," Inland American Press Release, September 18,2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In August 2014, Inland American announced that it would [[Corporate spin-off|spin-off]] 46 of its upscale hotels into a REIT named [[Xenia Hotels and Resorts (XHR)|Xenia Hotels &amp; Resorts]] (proposed [[NYSE]] ticker: XHR). On February 4, 2015, Xenia began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker XHR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inlandamerican.com/pdf/FINAL-Inland-Completes-Xenia-Spin-off-Press-Release-%2800651476-10xA26CA%29.pdf "Inland American Completes Spin-off of Xenia Hotels and Resorts, Inc."]&lt;/ref&gt; In this transaction, Inland American shareholders received a proportional number of shares of XHR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.com/irweblinkx/News.aspx?IID=4098709&amp;mode=1&amp;type=]"Inland American Announces Intent to Spin off Its Lodging Subsidiary," Inland American Press Release, August 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the spin-off, the estimated value of the REIT dropped 42.4% to about $4 a share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20150226/FREE/150229922/inland-american-cuts-nav-after-asset-sale|title=Inland American cuts NAV after asset sale|author=Bruce Kelly|work=Investment News|access-date=May 16, 2018|date=February 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[listing (finance)|listing]] event was the first for the Inland Group since the "disastrous Wall Street debut" of its last REIT, Inland Western, in 2012; Inland Western had debuted at only 60% of its original price to investors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagobusiness.com/realestate/20131017/CRED01/131019820/stepping-up-the-money-chase]“Stepping up the money chase.” ''Crain’s Chicago Business.''

By 2015, after spinning off a number of its hotel holdings, Inland American's value had fallen 60%, and its dividends were cut by 75%.

The '''International Labour and Amateur Sports Confederation''' (French: Confédération Sportive Internationale Travailliste et Amateur, '''CSIT''') is an international multi-sports organization. The organization celebrated its 100 years anniversary in 2013. The core principles of contributing to physical activity and sports have stayed in its action policy: it is a right of man and woman to practice sport by his/her own conditions. The key concept of the CSIT’s sport policy has always been in sport for all. – The policy stems from the historic ideas of the [[Socialist Workers' Sport International|international worker sport movement.]]

Nowadays, the main activities that the CSIT is organizing are the major and small sports events, more precisely Sport for All - games for amateurs and workers, competitive and non-competitive, for young and old, men and women from all over the world. Sports events are considered as festivals of friendship, cultural exchange, events promoting awareness of tolerance, respect, sustainability and fair play in sport environment addressed to unlimited size of participants; all those major and small events welcome the CSIT members, other non-member organizations, cooperation partners, governmental bodies, trade unions and business companies with sports activities for employees and amateurs worldwide.

Within the world of international sport, the CSIT maintains its support for everyone to benefit from sporting activities regardless of their qualifications, talent, nationality, age, sex and social circumstances.

During last two decades the CSIT has grown rapidly up to a global organization with altogether 31 national member organizations. They are in alphabetical order: FAST (Algeria), UNTA (Angola), ASKOE (Austria), AFSTB (Belgium), FROS (Belgium), BWF Sport &amp; Health (Bulgaria), CWCIE (China), PASEK (Cyprus), DAI (Denmark), JOUD (Estonia), KALEV (Estonia), TUL (Finland), FFST (France), FSGT (France), Rad- und Kraftfahrerbund ”Solidarität” Deutchland 1896 e.v. (Germany), AFWSI (Iran), AAI (Ireland), HAPOEL (Israel), ACSI (Italy), AICS (Italy), LTSA (Latvia), ”ZALGIRIS” (Lithuania), INDET (Mexico), NCS (Netherlands), INATEL (Portugal), CSE (Romania), ”Atomsport” (Russia), ZZBSS (Slovenia), SATUS (Switzerland), ONCST (Tunisia) and HIS (Turkey).

In addition there are two (sub) continental members: one from Americas (Confederacao Pan-Americana de Desporto do Trabalhador COPADET) and the other from Europe (Balkan Association for Workers’ Sport BAWS).  Furthermore, in January 2018 there were eight candidate members in process to become regular CSIT members; namely ANASTACAM (Cameron), UCEC (Spain, Catalonia), ICSF (Iraq), WSFI (India, LIBERTAS  (Italy), CSEN (Italy), MASA (Mongolia) and FederSwiss – Sport for All (Switzerland).

== Objective ==

The relevance of the CSIT sport policy is growing with importance, especially when commercialization and the lack of facilities and economic resources are reducing sports participation to passive entertainment for the vast majority of people. The CSIT is an organization, which aims at promoting and broadening workers' and amateurs' sport activities and thus developing into a world-wide movement. All activities pursue aspirations for democracy, solidarity and improvement of the quality of life through sport. The movement should encompass all sports federations and hence it would be possible to provide better opportunities for varied physical exercise for all citizens.

As stated above the CSIT stands for promotion of tolerance, respect, fair play, friendship, intercultural dialogue and integration through sport. A “Zero Tolerance” - Policy towards violence, fanatic behaviour and racism is pursued accurately.

== Fields of Activity ==

As listed the fields of the CSIT activities are as follows:
* '''Sports Championships from young to seniors'''  The championships are not games for professional top athletes, but for all workers and amateurs from different countries and cultures all over the world. Not only organizing competitions is in the foreground, but also organizing a huge festival with the objective of gathering sports friends as a worldwide family to advance the making of lifelong friendships, the exchange of information and experiences.
* '''Sports for All Activities: Sports for Elderly People (Seniors 55+)'''   The task is to organize events also for elderly ones by gathering them to the following experiences: to  practice and discovery of specific sports and physical activities, the exchange of training programs and knowledge relating to these and the exchange about culture, tourism and way of life of each country.
* '''Young Leaders Platform'''   The purpose of the Younger Leaders Platform is to share projects, events and camps, diffuse ideas and innovations, give information about different organizations, strengthen networks and ways of collaboration, learn to know better each other and develop a mutual support by sharing the expertise.

== Relevant Activities and Experiences ==

The achievement of the following aims is the most important task of the CSIT:
* to  bring together workers and amateur sports organizations of the entire world and to promote the foundation of new organizations,
* to co-operate with international organizations with the same goals and values,
* to support member organizations with their tasks and activities in all the fields of sport and physical culture, also through agreements with international organizations and authorities,
* to promote all activities that aim to improve the practice of sports by human beings of two sexes considering their age and their physical aptitudes in order to protect and improve their health;
* to achieve the aims by respecting the amateur status of athletes, the values of amateurism and the educational values of sport,
* to encourage to practice sport and physical activity in nature while considering the protection of the environment,
* to use sport as a means to promote peace and mutual understanding among people and to contribute to development of the world of social associations at any level,
* to sustain cultural advancement and to improve health including psychophysical conditions of the member unions as well as its individual members.

== Pillars of CSIT ==
The objectives of the CSIT are conducted in praxis by clearly defined pillars. They are the CSIT World Sports Games, the CSIT Single Championships, the International Tournaments, the International Festivals, the Sport for All-activities, the International Projects and the Health, Recreation and Fitness Activities.

[[File:Lease Purchase Agreement.pdf|thumb|Combines elements of a traditional rental agreement with an exclusive right of first refusal option for later purchase on the home. It is a shortened name for Lease with Option to Purchase Contract.]]

==The typical contents of a Lease-Purchase Contract==

''Monthly Payment'' - How much the tenant will be paying monthly.&lt;br /&gt;
''Rent Credit'' - How much of the tenant's monthly payment will go to the eventual down-payment of the property at the end of the lease. It is strongly suggested that the tenant establish an [[Escrow|escrow account]] to ensure the security of his or her rent credit.&lt;br /&gt;
''Duration'' - The timeframe of the Lease-Purchase Agreement. Usually 2–3 years or more. &lt;br /&gt;
''Property Value'' - The locked-in sale price of the property. The Tenant-Buyer and [[Seller]] usually agree to keep the property value the same despite [[Real estate economics|house market]] changes.&lt;br /&gt;
''Terms and Rules'' - This section talks about other details of the Lease such as [[Property tax|property taxes]], [[Home repair|home repairs]], [[Homeowner association|homeowner's association]] fee, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://resources.lawinfo.com/landlord-tenant/essential-terms-for-a-lease-agreement.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transaction Structure==

In a standard Lease-Purchase Contract, the two parties agree to a lease period during which rent is paid, and the terms of the sale at the end of the lease period, including sale price. Often, the contract is structured in two parts, one representing the ''lease term'' and the other a ''contract of sale''. The lease agreement expounds upon what responsibilities the tenant/buyer and landlord/seller undertake during the course of the lease. This contract will also include the option fee and how much of the monthly payment will be credited to the down-payment for the purchase of the home at the end of the lease.

At the end of the lease-term, the tenant/buyer has the option to purchase the house. The lump sum accrued from the initial deposit and the rent credit are only released to the buyer as down-payment on the house should the tenant/buyer decide to proceed with the purchase. The tenant/buyer is responsible for securing the necessary [[mortgage loan]] to finalize the purchase the home.

As is usually stated in the lease purchase contract, the option fee and accrued rent credit are both non-refundable should the tenant/buyer decide to walk at the end of the lease. The tenant/buyer is released from responsibility for the sale, and the landlord/seller is responsible for finding new tenants.

Should the tenant/buyer be unable to purchase the house due to a lack of financing, the tenant and landlord can agree to extend the option period, convert the lease purchase contract into a [[Lease|traditional rental agreement]], or end the contract with the tenant moving out and the landlord seeking other renters or buyers.&lt;ref&gt;http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2014/01/22/is-rent-to-own-or-contract-for-deed-right-for-you&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==

Lease-purchase contract agreements are open source in nature and flexible to the needs of the tenant/buyer and landlord/seller. Lease-purchase contracts are popular with tenant/buyers who have poor [[Credit score|credit scores]], lower savings for down payments, or people who are moving from one city to another but are pending a sale on their previous home. They are great for sellers who are having difficulty securing tenants for their properties, which can be common when a house is for sale.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/2009/03/02/renting-mortgage-property-lifestyle-real-estate_rent_to_buy_slide_2.html?thisSpeed=30000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difficulties==

In the [[United States]], when credits are applied to a purchase price the agreement becomes a financing contract and these contracts have been identified as predatory lending arrangements under the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd-Frank Act]]. Under this federal law any financing arrangement requires the purchaser of an owner occupied dwelling (one to four living units) is to qualify for any financing contract with a registered [[Loan officer|Mortgage Loan Originator]]. There are exemptions under this federal law for homeowners financing their primary residence, those in the business of [[real estate]] such as landlords are considered dealers. In all states, rent to own arrangements are no longer compliant with federal financing requirements.

Commercial loan arrangements are exempt from the Dodd-Frank Act, as a landlord might rent to own a property for the purpose of sub-letting to a tenant. This arrangement is not a popular arrangement but may be accomplished legally.

Lease-purchase contracts are not for everyone. As successful completion of the agreement and sale transaction requires financing through a traditional route, people whose circumstances will not allow them to receive a mortgage should abstain from rent-to-own real estate agreements.

==International Use==

===United Kingdom===

Amid concerns about how long saving for a deposit takes young professionals, a £400 million program was recently announced subsidizing rent at 20% for first-time homeowners. Subsidized rent prices lock in a period of time when the tenant-buyer saves, and the program requires sellers keep rent prices low to accommodate the process. At the end of the saving period, professionals have the option to purchase their flat. It now takes the average first-time buyer 22 years to save for a [[Damage deposit|deposit]] without parental assistance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2770614/Young-professionals-seven-years-cheap-rent-save-deposit-new-Government-scheme.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===

[[Auckland]]’s special housing area is subsidized by the Housing Foundation, providing homes for young families. Under their program, tenants pay rent on their homes for the first five years, then transition into paying mortgage payments. The Waimahia Inlet flagship development will see 282 new homes built over the next three years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/home-property/10454687/Couple-thankful-for-rent-to-own-scheme&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===

The [[Lagos]] State Home-Ownership Mortgage Scheme (LagosHOMS) is a rent-to-own housing program that targets people who currently cannot afford a mortgage, but given will be able to. Tenants are expected to pay rent for a period of time, after which they are invited to transition into mortgage payments. The program is designed with young professionals in mind, including [[Teacher|teachers]] and junior [[Civil service|public servants]]. The program has produced well over 200 new homeowners in the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://businessdayonline.com/2014/07/lagoshoms-plans-rent-to-own-scheme-creates-193-jobs-for-project-firms/#.VC1-2vldWk8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luk Van Wassenhove''' is a [[management]] thinker and educator. He is a professor at [[INSEAD]], where he holds the Henry Ford Chaired Professorship in Manufacturing. He is also the Director of the Humanitarian Research Group and a Fellow of CEDEP, the European Center for Executive Education, based in France.

== Career ==

A graduate of the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] (Catholic University of Louvain), professor Van Wassenhove was on the faculty there and at [[Erasmus University]] in Rotterdam before joining [[INSEAD]]. He created the INSEAD Social Innovation Center and currently leads INSEAD's Humanitarian Research Group.

Professor Van Wassenhove is senior editor for ''Manufacturing and Service Operations Management'' and departmental editor for ''Production and Operations Management''.

== Honors ==

Professor Van Wassenhove is a Fellow of the Production and Operations Management Society, a Distinguished Fellow of the Manufacturing and Services Operations Management Society, and Honorary Fellow of the European Operations Management Association. He is also a member of the Royal Flemish Academy of Sciences. In 2006, he received the [[EURO Gold Medal]] for outstanding academic achievement and in 2009 received the Lifetime Achievement Faculty Pioneer Award from the European Academy of Business in Society (EABIS) and the [[Aspen Institute]]. With 2018's naming as a Fellow of INFORMS for pioneering work on closed loop supply chains (sustainability) and humanitarian operations, Luk is the first professor to be recognised by five major professional Operations Management and Management Science societies.

== Work ==

Professor Van Wassenhove's work has covered a wide range of topics.  His work on manufacturing and operational excellence has centered largely on understanding how to create operating environments that facilitate learning and the evolution of best practices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hbr.org/2002/10/learning-across-lines-the-secret-to-more-efficient-factories ''Learning Across Lines: The Secret to More Efficient Factories'', Michael A Lapré and Luk N Van Wassenhove, Harvard Business Review, October 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2003 Harvard Business Review article with Daniel Guide&lt;ref&gt;[https://hbr.org/2002/02/the-reverse-supply-chain ''The Reverse Supply Chain'', V. Daniel R. Guide Jr. and Luk N. Van Wassenhove, Harvard Business Review, February 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; he explored the challenges of managing a "reverse supply chain" in which manufacturers take back used products and repurpose them. He pursued this theme further in two books,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Business-Aspects-Closed-Loop-Supply-Chains/dp/0887484026/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421176355&amp;sr=1-6 ''Business Aspects of Closed-Loop Supply Chains'', Daniel Guide and Luk Van Wassenhove, Carnegie Mellon 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; and,&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2Fb138818 ''Managing Closed-Loop Supply Chains'', Simme Flapper, Jo van Nunen, and Luk Van Wassenhove, Springer 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; looking in detail at the key differences between managing these types of supply chains and managing regular supply chains.  More recently, his work has focused on managing humanitarian logistics. In his 2009 book with Rolando Tomasini&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/humanitarian-logistics-rolando-tomasini/?k=9780230205758 ''Humanitarian Logistics'', Rolando Tomasini and Luk Van Wassenhove, INSEAD Business Press 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; he explored the challenges of creating logistics capabilities for situations of high uncertainty in terms of timing and location.  Professor Van Wassenhove has also explored issues around project management and in a 2008 article for Harvard Business Review argued that experience could paradoxically be a disadvantage in managing complex projects with significant time lags between cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hbr.org/2008/02/the-experience-trap ''The Experience Trap'', Kishore Sengupta, Luk N. Van Wassenhove, and Tarek K. Abdel-Hamid, Harvard Business Review, February 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Solid Group Inc., incorporated as United Paracale Mining Co. on October 9, 1933 and renamed to its current name in June 1996, is the company behind the MyPhone brand.&lt;ref name=newsflash&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bernardo-Lokin|first1=Kim|title=Man Behind the Pinoy 'My/Phone' finds his rainbow|url=http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/si/si002838.htm|accessdate=16 July 2015|work=Newsflash|publisher=TIMES|date=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group owns the brand through MySolid Technologies and Devices Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=My Solid Technologies &amp; Devices Corporation|url=http://www.solidgroup.com.ph/about/business/my-solid-technologies-devices-corporation|publisher=Solid Group, Inc.|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the father of Solid Group's CEO, David Lim owned a mobile phone manufacturer which makes phones branded as "Amoy Solid". His father tasked his younger brother Jason to help sell the product due to being good in working with electronic gadgets in the Lim family. According to David, the Amoy Solid won't make much sales in the Philippines and remarked that “Just from the way it (the brand) sounds, nobody wanted it,”, He however took note of the phones' dual SIM feature and suggested to rename the brand. Amoy Solid is rebranded as My|Phone.&lt;ref name=newsflash/&gt;

Solid Group applied for the registration of the MyPhone brand with the [[Intellectual Property Office (Philippines)|Intellectual Property Office]] (IPO) on June 25, 2007. The brand was first introduced to the market by Solid Group in September 2007.&lt;ref name=apple/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsflash/&gt;&lt;ref name=unbox&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nieves|first1=John|title=MyPhone Beats Apple in Local Trademark Battle|url=http://www.unbox.ph/gadget/myphone-beats-apple-in-local-trademark-battle/|accessdate=16 July 2015|publisher=unbox.ph|date=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MyPhone became the first mobile phone brand in the country to have a dual active SIM feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MyPhone: Proudly Pinoy-made|url=http://www.philstar.com:8080/gadgets/604494/myphone-proudly-pinoy-made|accessdate=16 July 2015|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MyPhone brand grew into one of the primary part of Solid Group, accounting about half of the company's revenue as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moran|first1=Kathy|title=Myphone: lWala ka sa phone ko (MyPhone: Your phone is no match against mine)|url=http://www.philstar.com/gadgets/508489/myphone-lwala-ka-sa-phone-ko|accessdate=16 July 2015|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=holdsown/&gt;

On May 18, 2016, the company unveiled its line of ISDB-T-capable smartphones and tablets, thus becoming the third local smart device vendor to offer the feature.&lt;ref name="Morial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yugatech.com/tech-brands/myphone-ventures-into-multimedia-launches-agila-rewards/#0U1q0KVPc786TwBS.97|title=MyPhone ventures into multimedia, launches Agila Rewards|last=Morial|first=Daniel|date=8 November 2016|work=Yugatech|accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 7, 2016, MyPhone expanded into mobile app development and digital content, touting itself as "The Multimedia Company". MyPhone has also announced the AGILA [[lock screen]] app to be bundled with select smartphone models, allowing local businesses to display advertising on phones similar to [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s practice of "special offer" ads embedded on discounted devices.&lt;ref name="Morial"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nieves"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unbox.ph/play/myphone-wants-to-give-people-cheaper-phones-by-showing-ads/|title=MyPhone Wants To Give People Cheaper Phones (By Showing Ads)|last=Nieves|first=John|date=7 November 2016|work=Unbox.ph|accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and design==
The mobile phones also include pre-installed applications and features designed by Filipino software developers. MyPhone mobile phones are reportedly manufactured in [[China]] in 2011. The most popular application pre-installed in MyPhone mobile phones as of the same year is the Catholic prayer app.&lt;ref name=holdsown&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gomez|first1=Raquel|title=Pinoy phone holds own with sales of P2B|url=http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view/20110115-314636/Pinoy-phone-holds-own-with-sales-of-P2B|accessdate=4 August 2016|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=15 January 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119030504/http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view/20110115-314636/Pinoy-phone-holds-own-with-sales-of-P2B|archivedate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market share==
In a study made by [[International Data Corporation]], MyPhone is the third biggest brand in the Philippines in terms of unit shipments in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dela Paz|first1=Chrisee Jalyssa|title=Philippines is third-largest market for smartphones in SE Asia -- IDC|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Economy&amp;title=philippines-is-third-largest-market-for-smartphones-in-se-asia----idc&amp;id=104884|accessdate=16 July 2015|publisher=BusinessWorld|date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, MyPhone identifies at least 50 mobile phone brands in the Philippine market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galolo|first1=Jeandie|title=Flash phones bank on e-commerce|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/business/2016/06/27/flash-phones-bank-e-commerce-481992|accessdate=4 August 2016|work=Sun Star Cebu|date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MyPhone is also distributed in Hong Kong to cater to [[Overseas Filipino Workers]] in the Chinese territory.&lt;ref name=holdsown/&gt;

==Issues==

===Trademark case vs. Apple Inc.'s iPhone===
[[Apple Inc.]] filed a lawsuit against Solid Group over the MyPhone name claiming that "MyPhone" is "confusingly similar" to its [[iPhone]] brand and that it would "likely to deceive or cause confusion". The Philippine [[Intellectual Property Office (Philippines)|Intellectual Property Office]] (IPO) dismissed the case filed by Apple Inc. on May 19, 2015 stating that while both brands are similarly named by using the word "phone", the word in question is not sufficient grounds in causing confusing between the two brands and noted that "phone" is a generic term used to describe mobile phones.&lt;ref name=apple/&gt;

IPO director Nathaniel Arevalo, criticized Apple Inc.'s move describing it as "a case of a giant trying to claim more territory than what it is entitled to, to the great prejudice of a local "Pinoy Phone" merchant who has managed to obtain a significant foothold in the mobile phone market through the marketing and sale of innovative products under a very distinctive trademark".&lt;ref name=apple/&gt;

'''Ta'isi Olaf Frederick Nelson,''' (24 February 1883 – 28 February 1944), also known as Ta'isi O. F. Nelson, was a successful businessman and one of the founding leaders of the [[Mau movement]] for [[Samoa]]n independence from [[Colony|colonial]] rule.

He was born on 24 February 1883 at [[Safune]] on the island of [[Savai'i]], [[Samoa]], and died in [[Apia]] on 28 February 1944. He was a successful planter, businessman and statesman. He was the son of a Swedish trader [[August Nilspeter Gustav Nelson]] and his Samoan wife,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of the Pacific Islands&amp;ndash;Kingdoms of the Reefs|author=Deryck Scarr|url=https://www.amazon.com/History-Pacific-Islands-Kingdoms-Reefs/dp/0732902096|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|year=1990|isbn=0-7329-0210-X|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinagogo Masoe, whose family had links to the Sa Tupua (a prominent chiefly family). His name '''Ta'isi''' is a ''[[fa'amatai|matai]]'' chief title from his mother's family from the Savai'i village of Asau.

Nelson's early years saw him working in his father's business, and he became a successful merchant in his own right. He expanded his father's copra trading business throughout the islands, and by the time he was thirty five, Nelson was one of the wealthiest members of the Apia community. He was influential in both the Samoan and European communities.

Under German rule, when the country was called [[German Samoa]] (1900 - 1914), the colonial administrators treated Nelson as an equal. But after [[New Zealand]] seized control in 1914, Nelson was excluded and alienated by the new government. Despite being elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Samoa|Legislative Council]] in 1924, he could do little as he and the other elected members were constantly overruled by the more numerous government appointees. This treatment turned Nelson into one of the major forces in the Samoan independence movement, known as the [[Mau movement|Mau]].

[[File:Central Bank of Samoa (2009).jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Clock Tower in [[Apia]], a gift from the Nelson Family.]]

In May 1927 Nelson founded a newspaper, the Samoa Guardian, to support its claims. In response to his growing public dissent, the New Zealand administration tried to brand Nelson as unscrupulous and a trouble maker.

The colonial administration's desperation to silence Nelson led them to exile him in January 1928, along with two other part-European members of the Mau. During his five years of exile, Nelson took his protests as far as the [[League of Nations]] in Geneva.

Six months after his return to Samoa, Nelson was sentenced to ten additional years in exile as well as eight months imprisonment in New Zealand. This was cut short in 1936, after [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] won the New Zealand general election in 1935. He returned to Samoa, and helped in the signing of the co-operation agreement between Samoan leaders and the New Zealand administration.

==Death==
Nelson died in 1944, and it was not until 1962 that his dream of Samoan independence was realised.

==Legacy==
Ta'isi had Twenty Seven daughters. Viopapa Lucy, Irene Gustave Noue, Olive Virginia Malienafau, Joyce Rosabel Piliopo, Sina Hope and Calmar Josephine Taufau and one son, Ta'isi who died as a result of the influenza epidemic in 1919 aged 4.&lt;ref&gt; See O'Brien, Tautai&lt;/ref&gt; Malienafau was the first Pacific Island graduate of the [[University of Auckland]], graduating with a law degree in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alumni.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/news-2008/2008/10/29/125th-Pacific-Ball.html|title=125th Pacific Ball - The University of Auckland|website=www.alumni.auckland.ac.nz|access-date=2017-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson's grandson Tupua Tamasese Tupuola Ta'isi Efi was the third [[Prime Minister of Samoa]] and from 2007 to 2017, he was, as [[Tufuga Efi|Tuiatua Tupua Tamasese Ta'isi Efi]], the [[Head of State of Samoa]]. The [[Nelson Memorial Public Library]] was donated to the Samoan people by the Nelson Family in Ta'isi's memory. His other grandson [[Misa Telefoni Retzlaff]] (Hermann Theodor Retzlaff) was in parliament from 1988 to 2010, and the Deputy Prime Minister of Samoa from 2000 to 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2362">Omega, comprising 226 hectares straddling the [[M62 motorway|M62]] Motorway in [[Warrington]], [[Cheshire]] is a property development site. The site comprises a large part of the former [[RAF Burtonwood|RAF/USAF Burtonwood airbase]]. A new junction on the M62 (junction 8) was built in anticipation of the development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwda.co.uk/news--events/press-releases/200201/junction-8,-m62-opens-in-time.aspx Junction 8, M62 opens in time for Christmas - Northwest Regional Development Agency&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole site will provide 650,000 sq m of offices, manufacturing and distribution space along with ancillary leisure/retail facilities, hotel and conference facilities. Around 24,000 jobs are likely to be created over the lifetime of the scheme to make one of Europe's largest [[business park]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siteselection.com/issues/2002/nov/p803/ Military Base Redevelopment: A Fighting Chance, Site Selection Magazine, November 2002&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to the economic downturn, planning conditions were relaxed in 2011 to allow phased development.

In July 2012 it was announced that the long-awaited £1bn development of Warrington’s Omega business park was to begin with a 200,000 sq ft warehouse and a £7 million contract for new roads at Omega North, opening up the site for further development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miller Developments starts £1bn Omega site|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/business/commercial_property/s/1583572_miller-developments-starts-1bn-omega-site|publisher=Manchester Evening News|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015 Omega North was complete with distribution warehouses for [[Brake Bros]], [[Hermes Group]], and [[Travis Perkins]]. Omega South had [[The Hut Group]] and the largest [[Walmart]] development outside the USA with an [[Asda]] distribution warehouse, and plans for retail, leisure, and phased housing developments.
 
A [[Warrington West railway station|new railway station]] on the Liverpool-Warrington-Manchester line has been proposed which will link with a bus service to the Omega site.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11906">{{Politics of France}}
In [[Politics of France|French politics]], an '''''ordonnance''''' ({{IPA-fr|ɔʁdɔnɑ̃s|lang|Fr-ordonnance.ogg}}, "order") is a [[statutory instrument]] issued by the [[Council of Ministers of France|Council of Ministers]] in an area of law normally reserved for [[primary legislation]] enacted by the [[French Parliament]].  They function as temporary statutes pending ratification by the Parliament; failing ratification they function as mere executive regulations.

''Ordonnances'' should not be confused with ''[[décret]]s'' issued by the [[Prime Minister of France|prime minister]] (an [[Order in Council#France|order-in-council]]) or [[president of France|president]], or with [[ministerial order]]s (''arrêtés''); these are issued either in matters where the [[Constitution of France|Constitution]] allows primary legislation from the Council or as secondary legislation implementing a statute.
[[File:Pyramide des normes.png|thumb|[[:fr:Hiérarchie des normes en droit français|Hierarchy of French legal norms]]]]
In the [[Judiciary of France|French justice system]], the word can also refer to a summary ruling made by a single judge for simple cases.

==Current usage==
===Motivations===
Article 34 of the [[Constitution of France]] restricts certain legal matters to [[statute law|primary legislation]] to be enacted by [[Parliament of France|Parliament]]. All other areas of law fall within the domain of delegated legislation in the form of orders-in-council (OIC) issued by the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] or ministerial orders issued by individual cabinet ministers.

Orders-in-council and other [[secondary legislation|delegated legislation]] issued in areas reserved for primary legislation are illegal, unless they are specifically authorized by statute. Such orders define implementation measures and details left out by the originating statute.

For various reasons explained below, the Executive may sometimes want to pass [[primary legislation]] in a field reserved by statute. The ''ordonnances'' are the constitutional means to do so.

Delegated legislation can be repealed through litigation before the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] (acting in their role of legislative review) if they violate general legal principles or constitutional rights, whereas primary legislation may be ruled unconstitutional only through judicial review before the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]]. Statutes are thus relatively more solid.

===Vocabulary notes===
The decisions made by the [[President of France|French President]] under art. 16 of the French Constitution, enabling him to take emergency measures in times where the existence of the Republic is at stake (a form of [[reserve powers]]) are not called ''ordonnances'', but simply ''décisions''.

The introductory sentence of an ''ordonnance'', as published in the [[Journal Officiel de la République Française]], is: "The President of the Republic [...], after hearing the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]], after hearing the Council of Ministers, orders:". The word ''ordonnance'' comes from the same root as ''ordonner'' "to order".

===Procedure===
====Normal procedure====
In the [[French Fifth Republic]], most ''ordonnances'' operate pursuant to article 38 of the [[Constitution of France|French Constitution]].

The Council of Ministers first introduces a bill before Parliament authorizing it to issue ''ordonnances'' to implement its program. The bill specifies a limited period of time, as well as a topic for the proposed ''ordonnances''. If the bill passes in Parliament, the French Cabinet can issue ''ordonnances'' on the given legal matter within the specified time period. The Executive must consult the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] on every ''ordonnance''; the advice of the Council is compulsory but nonbinding.

An ''ordonnance'' must be signed by the French President, the Prime Minister and relevant ministers. This proved in 1986 to be a source of tension, during a period of [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]] when President [[François Mitterrand]] and Prime Minister [[Jacques Chirac]] were of opposite political opinions, and the President refused to sign ''ordonnances'' requested by the Prime Minister, forcing him to go through the normal parliamentary procedure;&lt;ref&gt;Jean V. Poulard, “The French Double Executive and the Experience of Cohabitation”, ''Political Science Quarterly'', vol. 105, no. 2 (Summer 1990): [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2151025 243-267]&lt;/ref&gt; it was however controversial at the time whether he had the right to refuse to sign them.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Luc Parodilien, “[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rfsp_0035-2950_1997_num_47_3_395180 Proportionnalisation périodique, cohabitation, atomisation partisane : un triple défi pour le régime semi-présidentiel de la Cinquième République]”, ''Revue française de science politique'', vol 47, no. 3-4 (1997): 292-312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valérie Moureaud, “[http://www.repas-senat.fr/docs/2/article3.pdf Le refus de signature des ordonnances en 1986 : un enjeu structurant en période de cohabitation]”, ''Revue d'étude politique des assistants parlementaires'', no. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the time period has elapsed, the Cabinet must introduce before Parliament a bill of [[ratification]] for the ''ordonnances'', otherwise these lapse at the end of the period. Until Parliament has voted the ratification bill, the ''ordonnances'', similar to executive orders, can be challenged before the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]].

If they are ratified, they become like ordinary statutes. There is, however, no obligation that they should be ratified, in which case they are mere regulations; in fact, between 1960 and 1990, out of 158 ''ordonnances'', only about 30 were ratified.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.senat.fr/ej/ej_ordonnance/ej_ordonnance0.html#toc3 Les ordonnances - bilan au 31 décembre 2007]'', section I&lt;/ref&gt; This can happen because even though the ratification bill has been brought before Parliament, it is not necessarily scheduled for examination and vote. If Parliament votes down the ratification bill, it does not go into effect.

The Constitutional Council and the Council of State have admitted that ratification, in addition to explicit means (vote on the ratification bill, or ratification amendment added to another bill), could also be performed ''implicitly'', when Parliament refers to an ''ordonnance'' as though it were a statute.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.senat.fr/ej/ej_ordonnance/ej_ordonnance2.html#toc94 Les ordonnances - bilan au 31 décembre 2007]'', section III C&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Castaing"&gt;Cécile Castaing, “La ratification implicite des ordonnances de codification. Haro sur « La grande illusion »”, ''Revue française de droit constitutionnel'', no. 58 (2004/2): 275-304, [[P.U.F.]], {{ISBN|978-2-13-054645-0}}, {{DOI|10.3917/rfdc.058.0275}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, implicit ratification was prohibited by [[French constitutional law of 23 July 2008|a 2008 constitutional amendment]].

It has occasionally happened that the Executive did not make use of the authorization that they had requested and obtained.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.senat.fr/ej/ej_ordonnance/ej_ordonnance0.html#toc19 Les ordonnances - bilan au 31 décembre 2007]'', section I A 3&lt;/ref&gt;

====Budget bills====
It is of particular importance that budget bills should be voted in a timely manner, since they authorize taxes and spending. For this reason, the Government can adopt the budget by ''ordonnances'' if Parliament has not been able to agree on it within 70 days after the proposal of the budget (Constitution, article 47). The same applies for social security budget bills, but with a 50-day period (Constitution, article 47-1).

Neither of these procedures has ever been used.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.senat.fr/ej/ej_ordonnance/ej_ordonnance0.html#toc3 Les ordonnances - bilan au 31 décembre 2007]'', introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

====Overseas territories====
Article 74-1 of the Constitution allows the Government to extend legislation applicable to [[Metropolitan France]] to overseas territories by ''ordonnances''. These ''ordonnances'' lapse if they have not been ratified within 18 months by Parliament.

===Usage and controversy===

The use of ''ordonnances'' is not controversial when used for technical, uncontroversial texts (such as the ordinances that converted all sums in [[French Franc]]s to [[Euro]]s in the various laws in force in France).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=JUSX0000009L Law 2000-517] authorized the government to adopt ordinances to convert sums from Francs to Euros in various legislative texts.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ordonnances'' are also used to adopt and adapt [[European Directives]] into French law in order to avoid delayed adoption of a Directive, which often happens and is criticized by the [[EU Commission]] and exposes France to fines.

''Ordonnances'' are also used to codify law into codes, in order to rearrange them for the sake of clarity without substantially modifying them. Such usage has however been criticized for the legal risks that it poses if the ratification act is never voted.&lt;ref name="Castaing"/&gt;

The use of ''ordonnances'' for controversial laws is generally criticized by the opposition as anti-democratic, and demeaning to Parliament (Guillaume, 2005), in much the same way as the use of [[Article 49 of the French Constitution#Commitment of responsibility on a bill (49.3)|article 49-3]] to force a bill to be voted.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Rullier, ''Le Parlement sous la onzième législature 1997-2002'', Revue française de droit constitutionnel, n° 54 2003/2, pp. 429 - 447, {{ISBN|978-2-13-053967-4}}, {{DOI|10.3917/rfdc.054.0429}}: the former chief of staff of the Minister for relations with Parliament during the [[Lionel Jospin|Jospin]] administration criticizes the use of ''ordonnances'' and article 49-3 in 1995 by [[Alain Juppé]], particularly to force a reform of Social Security without the intervention of Parliament, resulting in [[1995 strikes in France|mass strikes]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Previous usage==
''Ordonnances'' have been extensively used as a form of [[rule by decree]] in periods where the government operated without a working Parliament: [[Vichy France]], where the executive had dismissed Parliament and other [[democracy|democratic]] structures, the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]], until it could establish a legislature, and in the last days of the [[French Fourth Republic]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&amp;dateJO=19580604&amp;numTexte=&amp;pageDebut=05327&amp;pageFin= Loi n°58-520 du 3 juin 1958 relative aux pleins pouvoirs]&lt;/ref&gt; and the early days of the [[French Fifth Republic]], until the new constitution had come into force and legislative elections had been held (article 92 of the Constitution, now repealed).

Certain legal texts enacted by the King in the medieval and ''[[Ancien Régime in France|ancien régime]]'' eras were called ''ordonnances'', the best known of which today is the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]].

'''Papal Arbitration''' was a form of [[international arbitration]] used between warring [[Roman Catholic]] countries where the [[Pope]] tried to bring both sides to peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Papal Arbitration}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent example was the [[Papal mediation in the Beagle conflict]] between [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3829">'''Plastics engineering''' encompasses the processing, design, development, and manufacture of [[plastic]]s products. A plastic is a [[polymer]]ic material that is in a semi-liquid state, having the property of [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] and exhibiting flow. Plastics engineering encompasses plastics material and plastic machinery. Plastic Machinery is the general term for all types of machinery and devices used in the plastics processing industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plasticextrudermachine.com/plastics_engineering.html] Introduction of Plastics Engineering. PlASTICEXTRUDERMACHINE.COM&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of plastic materials poses unique challenges to an engineer. [[Mechanical properties]] of plastics are often difficult to quantify, and the plastics engineer has to design a product that meets certain specifications while keeping costs to a minimum. Other properties that the plastics engineer has to address include: outdoor weatherability, thermal properties such as upper use temperature, electrical properties, barrier properties, and resistance to chemical attack.

In plastics engineering, as in most [[engineering]] disciplines, the [[economics]] of a product plays an important role. The cost of plastic materials ranges from the cheapest [[commodity plastics]] used in [[mass production|mass-produced]] consumer products to the very expensive, specialty plastics. The cost of a plastic product is measured in different ways, and the absolute cost of a plastic material is difficult to ascertain. Cost is often measured in price per pound of material, or price per unit volume of material. In many cases however, it is important for a product to meet certain specifications, and cost could then be measured in price per unit of a property. Price with respect to processibility is often important, as some materials need to be processed at very high temperatures, increasing the amount of cooling time a part needs. In a large production run cooling time is very expensive.

Some plastics are manufactured from re-cycled materials but their use in engineering tends to be limited because the consistency of formulation and their physical properties tend to be less consistent. Electrical and electronic equipment and motor vehicle markets together accounted for 58 percent of engineered plastics demand in 2003.[http://mdmr.net/onesource/catalog/Engineered-Plastics-p-517.html] Engineered plastics demand in the US was estimated at $9,702 million in 2007.

A big challenge for plastics engineers is the reduction of the ecological footprints of their products. First attempts like the [[Vinyloop]] process can guarantee that a product's primary energy demand is 46 percent lower than conventional produced PVC. The [[global warming potential]] is 39 percent lower. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.solvayplastics.com/sites/solvayplastics/SiteCollectionDocuments/VinyLoop/The%20VinyLoop%20Eco-Footprint%20Study.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4244">[[Image:RaschigRings005.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Raschig rings one inch (25 mm) ceramic]]
'''Raschig rings''' are pieces of tube, approximately equal in length and diameter, used in large numbers as a [[packed bed]] within columns for [[distillation column|distillation]]s and other [[chemical engineering]] processes. They are usually ceramic or metal and provide a large surface area within the volume of the column for interaction between liquid and gas vapours. Raschig rings are named after their inventor, the German chemist [[Friedrich Raschig]].&lt;ref name=Sella&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andrea Sella | year = 2008 | work = Chemistry World | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = 83 | title = Raschig's Rings | url = http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2008/September/RaschigsRings.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Product description: Ceramic Raschig Ring|url=http://www.chemicalpackings.com/product/ceramic-raschig-ring.html|website=LianChuang|date=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
They form what is now known as random packing, and enabled Raschig to perform distillations of much greater efficiency than his competitors using [[fractional distillation]] columns with trays.&lt;ref name=Sella/&gt; 

In a distillation column, the [[reflux]] or condensed vapour runs down the column, covering the surfaces of the rings, while vapour from the [[reboiler]] goes up the column.  As the vapour and liquid pass each other countercurrently in a small space, they tend towards equilibrium. Thus, less volatile material tends to go downwards, and more volatile material upwards.  

They are also used for devices where gas and liquid are put in contact for purposes of gas absorption, stripping or chemical reaction, and as a support for [[biofilm]]s in biological reactors.

Raschig rings made from [[borosilicate glass]] are sometimes employed in the handling of nuclear materials, where they are used inside vessels and tanks containing solutions of fissile material, for example solutions of enriched [[uranyl nitrate]], acting as neutron absorbers and preventing a potential [[criticality accident]].&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/Miscellaneous/raschigrings.htm Oak Ridge Associated Universities] Raschig Rings for Criticality Control (1980s)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developments ==
Given the success of the simply-shaped Raschig ring, there have been many other forms developed in an attempt to either improve upon it, or to avoid patents for particular designs.

=== Pall ring ===
The Pall ring attempts to increase the useful aspects of packing, by giving an increased number of edges to disrupt flow, whilst also reducing the volume taken up by the ring packing medium itself. Rather than using a solid-walled tube, the Pall ring resembles an open basket structure of thin bars. These form both a tube and also a radial structure of cross bars.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web

  |website=Raschig-Jaeger Technologies
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pall rings may be injection moulded of plastics, moulded of ceramics or press-formed from metal sheet.

=== Super ring ===
The Raschig 'Super Ring' represents a further development of the same concepts behind the Pall ring. It optimises the production of turbulent film-type flows and prevents the formation of drops.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web

'''Riccardo Illy''' (born 24 September 1955) is an Italian businessman and former politician.

==Biography==
Riccardo Illy was born in [[Trieste]], [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]]. His paternal grandfather, [[Francesco Illy]], was of [[Hungary|Hungarian]] origin.

As a young man Illy worked as a skiing instructor at [[Piancavallo]] and a sailing instructor at [[Monfalcone]]. He married [[Rossana Bettini]], food and wine journalist, at a young age. They have a daughter Daria who is now a Physical Education teacher and personal trainer.

Illy started work in the family's coffee making firm [[illy]]caffè in 1977, which was founded by his grandfather in 1933. As the company's Business Director, reorganised its internal business structure as well as the structures of the other firms it controlled. He created a marketing department for the company which, up to then, did not have one. He subsequently served as CEO and is presently the Vice President of the company, which has a presence in over 140 countries. Illy is the author of a book entitled ''Dal Caffe all'Espresso'' (''From Coffeebeans to Espresso'') published by Mondadori and translated into English, French and German.

Illy has held positions of Vice President of the Association of Industrialists in [[Trieste]] and President of the Seminario Permanente Veronelli.

Standing as an independent supported by a coalition which preceded [[Ulivo]] (the Olive Branch Party) and also by a [[lista civica|civic list]] bearing his name, Illy has been elected twice&amp;nbsp;— in 1993 and again in 1997&amp;nbsp;— as Mayor of [[Trieste]]. As First Citizen and a sincere music lover, he has taken up the position of President of Trieste's Theatre Giuseppe Verdi. Until 2002 he was Chairman of the Organizing Committee for the Transpadane European Railway Line.

Illy was honoured with the title of Grande Ufficiale ([[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]]) by the President of the Italian Republic, and the [[Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria|Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold]] title by the President of the Austrian Republic. He was awarded an honoris causa degree in Political Sciences at the [[University of Trieste]] after his "lectio doctoralis" on the topic of enlargement of Europe to the Eastern Countries.

In 2001, Illy was elected a Member of the Italian Parliament with the mixed group of independent members. He was part of the IX Parliamentary Commission (Transport, Postal Services and Telecommunications) and Secretary to the Advisory Parliamentary Commission regarding the bringing into force of the administrative reforms. He has strongly believed in and promoted the referendum not confirming the regional electoral law. When the direct election of the President was obtained, he kept his promise to the citizens of Trieste and he ran as a candidate for the [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] Region supported by the Democratic Coalition Party (Intesa Democratica). He was elected President of the Region in the elections held on 8 and 9 June 2003.

He was unanimously elected President of the [[Assembly of European Regions]] (AER) in December 2004, and his mandate ended in 2008. The AER currently has 250 member Regions from 30 European countries.

On 14 April 2008 Illy was defeated in his [[re-election bid]] by candidate [[Renzo Tondo]], and his term as President ended on 18 April 2008.

[[File:POC elections feb 2018 winners b.jpg|thumb|Vargas' election as POC President in February 2018.]]
Ricky Vargas first attempted to run for the position of Philippine Olympic Committee President in 2016, challenging then incumbent President, Jose "Peping" Cojuangco Jr. However his candidacy, along with Abraham Tolentino's who was vying for chairmanship, for the November 2016 elections were rejected after the sport's body commission on election which was led by [[Francisco Elizalde]] ruled them ineligible for being not being "active member". Vargas, who only attended in one general assembly of the POC, argued that being an active member does not equate to physical presence in the POC's general assembly. He attempted to have the November 2016 elections postponed by the Pasig Regional Trial Court to allow for dialogue between his camp and Cojuangco's but failed. Cojuangco secured a fourth term unopposed in the 2016 elections.

The Pasig court later ruled the results of the 2016 elections for the post of president and chairman null and void, said that the commission on elections cannot restrict or qualify the eligibility criteria of being an "active member", and ordered and election with Vargas and Tolentino as candidates to be held in February 23, 2018. An extraordinary meeting was held in February where the general assembly agreed to hold elections and a commissions on elections was formed which was also led by Francisco Elizalde. Given the latter fact, Vargas and Tolentino anticipated that they will be disqualified again though Elizalde allowed the two to run to avoid being cited in contempt by court despite the election head's view that the two are ineligible.

Vargas secured a 24–15 victory over Cojuangco for the post of POC President ending the latter's long tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.inquirer.net/285547/ricky-vargas-beats-peping-cojuangco-poc-presidency|title=Ricky Vargas beats Peping Cojuangco for POC presidency|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|last=Reyes|first=Marc Anthony|date=February 23, 2018|accessdate=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vargas officially began his term&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pedralvez|first1=Bong|title=Oath-taking rites for POC leaders set|url=http://www.malaya.com.ph/business-news/sports/oath-taking-rites-poc-leaders-set|accessdate=8 March 2018|work=Malaya Business Insights|date=2 March 2018|quote=The source said Vargas preferred a separate occasion for the oath-taking “before he officially assumes his duties as the new POC president.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; on March 5, 2018 when he took his oath before Philippine President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] in the [[Malacañang Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lopez|first1=Virgil|title=New POC execs Vargas, Tolentino take oath before Duterte|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/645528/new-poc-execs-vargas-tolentino-take-oath-before-duterte/story/|accessdate=8 March 2018|work=GMA News|date=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first board meeting under Vargas' tenure was held the day after where his predecessor turned over the POC flag to Vargas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramos|first1=Gerry|title=Ricky Vargas reaches out to predecessor Peping Cojuangco as POC leadership officially turned over|url=https://www.spin.ph/psc-poc/news/ricky-vargas-reaches-out-to-predecessor-peping-cojuangco-as-poc-leadership-officially-turned-over|accessdate=8 March 2018|work=Sports Interactive Network Philippines|date=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''service voucher''' is a financial instrument which allows a public authority to target social services at those it deems in need, and at the same time to promote employment and labour market integration. It effectively boosts demand for certain services which meet social policy objectives.

A voucher scheme will typically start by defining services which are needed in society, but which are being supplied neither by the [[Market (economics)|market]] nor by the [[public sector]]. These might include for example [[home care]], household repairs, [[ironing]], or [[bicycle]] hire and repair. The activities within the scheme will typically be agreed with [[trade union]]s and [[employer]]s' organisations, to avoid concern about the disturbance of [[unfair competition]].

Potential providers of these services are identified, often from among the [[unemployment#Long-term unemployment|long-term unemployed]].

Vouchers are sold to people who want to use the service. The price is subsidised, so that on the one hand the service is affordable - and for instance can compete with informal (illegal) work - and on the other provides decent condition working for the employees (including [[social insurance]] cover, holiday pay etc.). An example of this kind of subsidy regime can be found in [[Belgium]], where service vouchers for house cleaning, laundry, ironing, sewing, cooking, running errands, and transport for people with reduced mobility are sold to people who require these services. Each person residing in Belgium with a National Register Number is entitled to a quota of 500 service vouchers a year, with the first 400 service vouchers sold at a rate of 9 EUR each, and remaining 100 service vouchers sold at a rate of 10 EUR. In addition, each household has a quota of maximum 1000 service vouchers, with exceptions given to single parents and people with disabilities, who may be entitled to 2000 service vouchers, depending on the circumstances. Mothers with their own business who have just given birth are also entitled to 105 extra service vouchers. This initiative was made in order to combat the black market and has resulted in the creation of many jobs. This subsidy scheme allows for domestic workers to be declared and benefit from a legal salary, health insurance, paid holidays, and a pension; benefits that were not all possible when working on the black market. For each service voucher, a domestic servant receives a salary of 22.69 EUR, paid by both the customer and the state. In addition, tax breaks are also given to the first 156 service vouchers purchased yearly, creating another incentive to purchase these services. Similar systems exists in France and in Sweden.

==Analysis of benefits==
Vouchers can be defined as subsidies granting limited purchasing power to an individual to choose among a restricted set of services. In the field of personal and household services, their use has been growing in recent years, following successful experiences in some European countries. Vouchers can be seen as tools that would lie between in kind provision of services and cash distribution of income to be used (or not) for these services. Very basically, vouchers are simple means of payment. The payment can be integrally made by the user, or by a public financer, and mixed forms of payment with other actors can be imagined (e.g. companies paying for part of the cost or insurance companies providing some services through this means).

In the field of care policies, the increasing use of vouchers has sometimes been analysed as an element of a current commodification trend that corresponds to an increase in what can be labelled a “social market” logic. Social markets mainly rely on demand-side measures, the aim being to ensure that users or consumers of services are offered more choice and are, financially speaking, able to purchase personal services. The market logic involves developing the demand side with the aim of transforming “latent” demand into effective demand. These social markets thus involve competition between different modes of provision, with the user receiving direct or indirect assistance from public authorities to make their choice.

In the field of “non-care” services, vouchers are being used mostly for the same reasons as those in the care sector, that is for a series of supposed advantages in particular regarding efficiency of public spending, expected impact on undeclared labour but also quality issues (quality of services and quality of jobs). 
# A first advantage is '''freedom of choice'''. Under the logic of social markets, vouchers are supposed to allow for user choice between different types of providers (sometimes including public providers) or simply between providers of one single type (e.g. domestic workers). 
# A second advantage is '''efficiency'''. Vouchers offer less freedom of choice than pure money but their efficiency is linked to the fact that the demand is “channelled”, i.e. that it is oriented towards certain types of services or activities; moreover there is an efficiency for public finances as if not used, the voucher does not represent a cost for authorities. As well it is possible to imagine public policies targeting people with special needs. 
# A third advantage is '''reduction of undeclared labour'''. Vouchers are meant to simplify the administrative procedures when employing someone to outsource housework tasks or care activities. In some cases, the purchase of a voucher does not entail the duty to sign a labour contract between the parties (as in France under specific conditions), which might have a negative impact on working conditions.
# Further, social security contributions are calculated automatically and directly paid. Because they considerably '''reduce administrative burden''', vouchers are supposed to be a significant incentive for the use of declared labour rather than undeclared labour. 
# Fifth, and finally, vouchers might foster '''quality of services'''. The partisans of the market-oriented and purchaser-provider model consider that it encourages innovation, flexibility and quality, as the market should eliminate the bad quality suppliers and encourage a user-oriented approach. As a Eurofound report notes: “The more actively involved service users are in determining the content of care, the more likely it is that care services will be greater suited to the individual’s values, culture, attitudes and circumstances. Empowerment of care recipients enables them to purchase their own care and have the security assurance of contractual rights. This can potentially influence the quality of care, as low standard care services would simply not be ‘bought’. At the same time, care recipients could tailor a care programme to their specific needs, again raising quality and improving delivery”. Voucher schemes could be steered in this direction, according to this report and to certain authors.&lt;ref&gt;Developing personal and household services in the EU - A focus on housework activities, European Commission, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Wazirabad bridge on sahibi river.jpg|thumb|left|The old wazirabad bridge]]
In 1997, 28 school students died in an accident on the narrow Wazirabad bridge.&lt;ref name= kolkata24x7/&gt; Since then, the Delhi government had plans to build another parallel wide bridge nearby to alleviate traffic congestions. By the end of 1998, the [[Government of Delhi|Delhi government]] finalised the draft plan for this bridge.&lt;ref name= kolkata24x7/&gt; The bridge was inaugurated on 4 November 2018 by the Chief Minister of Delhi [[Arvind Kejriwal]] with the aim to ease the burgeoning traffic congestion on the existing [[Wazirabad]] bridge.&lt;ref name= Y/&gt;&lt;ref name="NDTV_inaugration"&gt;{{cite news |title=Delhi's Signature Bridge To Have Selfie Spots, Glass Viewing Deck |url=https://www.ndtv.com/delhi-news/delhi-signature-bridge-opens-to-public-on-monday-heres-what-it-offers-1942195 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |publisher=NDTV |date=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
By the end of 1998, the Delhi government finalized the draft plan made by Divyansh Sharma for the construction of the bridge. However, the construction of the bridge was stuck due to multiple reasons - lack of manpower and financial difficulties, being the major reason. When the project started, its cost was estimated to be ₹1,100&amp;nbsp;crore. Now it has surpassed  ₹1,875&amp;nbsp;crores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= More funds for Signature Bridge may help it meet latest dead|url= https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/more-funds-for-signature-bridge-may-help-it-meet-latest-deadline/articleshow/64890739.cms|date=  7 July 2018| accessdate= 7 July 2018 |publisher=Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theweekendleader&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theweekendleader.com/Headlines/13516/delhi-government-clears-signature-bridge-project.html|title=Delhi government clears signature bridge project |date= 6 July 2018| accessdate=7 July 2018|publisher=www.theweekendleader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of Delhi|Delhi government]] was tight handed and it was very difficult for it to shell out the extra rising budget. ₹1,244&amp;nbsp;crores of rupees have been sanctioned recently through PBDB. The work had started in full swing in 2004 on the bridge. A fresh deadline of end 2016 was set in 2013.&lt;ref name=theweekendleader/&gt; Since then half a dozen times, deadlines have been missed and fresh deadlines set. Finally, the bridge was inaugurated in November 2018.&lt;ref name=kolkata24x7&gt;{{cite news|url=https://kolkata24x7.com/delhi-may-get-indias-first-asymmetrical-cable-stayed-bridge-by-october-will-decongest-wazirabad-bridge.html|title= নজির গড়ে দেশের বুকে তৈরি হচ্ছে প্রথম ‘অ্যাসমিট্রিক্যাল’ ব্রিজ|date= 6 July 2018| accessdate=6 July 2018|publisher= kolkata24x7.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8231">'''Standard cost accounting''' is a traditional [[cost accounting]] method introduced in the 1920s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Vangermeersch]]. "[http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/cdm/ref/collection/aah/id/174 Control: Classic model]," in: ''History of Accounting: An International Encyclopedia.'' [[Michael Chatfield]], Richard Vangermeersch eds. 1996/2014. p. 174-75.&lt;/ref&gt; as an alternative for the traditional cost accounting method based on [[historical costs]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Downie (1927). ''The mechanism of standard (or predetermined) cost accounting and efficiency records.'' p. 7, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Adolph Matz]] (1962) ''Cost accounting.'' p. 584.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Standard cost accounting uses [[ratio]]s called [[Efficiency (economics)|efficiencies]] that compare the labor and materials actually used to produce a good with those that the same goods would have required under "standard" conditions. As long as actual and standard conditions are similar, few problems arise. Unfortunately, standard cost accounting methods developed about 100 years ago, when labor comprised the most important cost of manufactured goods. Standard methods continue to emphasize labor efficiency even though that resource now constitutes a (very) small part of the cost in most cases.

Standard cost accounting can hurt managers, workers, and firms in several ways. For example, a policy decision to increase inventory can harm a manufacturing manager's [[performance evaluation]]. Increasing inventory requires increased production, which means that processes must operate at higher rates. When (not if) something goes wrong, the process takes longer and uses more than the standard labor time. The manager appears responsible for the excess, even though s/he has no control over the production requirement or the problem.

In adverse economic times, firms use the same efficiencies to downsize, right size, or otherwise reduce their labor force. Workers laid off, under those circumstances, have even less control over excess inventory and cost efficiencies than their managers.

Many financial and cost accountants have agreed for many years on the desirability of replacing standard cost accounting. They have not, however, found a successor.

== History ==
One of the first authors to foresee standard costing was the British accountant [[George P. Norton]] in his 1889 ''Textile Manufacturers' Bookkeeping.''&lt;ref name="DS 1994"&gt;[[David Solomons (accounting scholar)|Solomons, David]]. "Costing Pioneers: Some Links with the Past*." ''The Accounting Historians Journal'' 21.2 (1994): 136.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Whitmore (accountant)|John Whitmore]], a disciple of [[Alexander Hamilton Church]], is credited for actually presenting "the first detailed description of a [[standard cost]] system"&lt;ref name="MC 2014"&gt;[[Michael Chatfield]]. "[http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/cdm/ref/collection/aah/id/686 Whitmore, John]," in: ''History of Accounting: An International Encyclopedia.'' Michael Chatfield, [[Richard Vangermeersch]] eds. 1996/2014. p. 607-8.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1906/08. The Anglo-American management consultant [[G. Charter Harrison]] is credited for designing one of the earliest known complete standard cost systems in the early 1910s.&lt;ref name="MC 2014-291"&gt;[[Michael Chatfield]]. "[http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/cdm/ref/collection/aah/id/374 Harrison, G. Charter 1881-]," in: Michael Chatfield, [[Richard Vangermeersch]] (eds.), ''The History of Accounting (RLE Accounting): An International Encyclopedia'' 2014. p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

When cost accounting was developed in the 1890s, labor was the largest fraction of product cost and could be considered a variable cost. Workers often did not know how many hours they would work in a week when they reported on Monday morning because time-keeping systems (based in [[time book]]) were rudimentary. Cost accountants, therefore, concentrated on how efficiently managers used labor since it was their most important variable resource. Now, however, workers who come to work on Monday morning almost always work 40 hours or more; their cost is fixed rather than variable. However, today, many managers are still evaluated on their labor efficiencies, and many "downsizing," "rightsizing," and other labor reduction campaigns are based on them.

Traditional standard costing (TSC), used in [[cost accounting]], dates back to the 1920s and is a central method in [[management accounting]] practiced today because it is used for financial statement reporting for the valuation of an income statement and balance sheets line items such as the cost of goods sold (COGS) and inventory valuation.  Traditional standard costing must comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP US) and actually aligns itself more with answering financial accounting requirements rather than providing solutions for management accountants.  Traditional approaches limit themselves by defining cost behavior only in terms of production or sales volume.

== Standard cost accounting, topics ==
=== Historical costs ===
Historical costs are costs whereby materials and labor may be allocated based on past experience. Historical costs are a classification of costs by time. Historical costs are costs incurred in the past. Predetermined costs are computed in advance on basis of factors affecting cost elements. In the 19th century and early 20th century [[time book]], s were used to register working time, and eventually determine historical costs. 

In modern cost account of recording historical costs was taken further, by allocating the company's fixed costs over a given period of time to the items produced during that period, and recording the result as the total cost of production. This allowed the ''full cost'' of products that were not sold in the period they were produced to be recorded in inventory using a variety of complex accounting methods, which was consistent with the principles of [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] (GAAP). It also essentially enabled managers to ignore the fixed costs, and look at the results of each period in relation to the "standard cost" for any given product.

: For example: if the railway coach company normally produced 40 coaches per month, and the fixed costs were still $1000/month, then each coach could be said to incur an Operating Cost/overhead of $25 =($1000 / 40). Adding this to the variable costs of $300 per coach produced a full cost of $325 per coach.

This method tended to slightly distort the resulting unit cost, but in mass-production industries that made one product line, and where the fixed costs were relatively low, the distortion was very minor.

: For example: if the railway coach company made 100 coaches one month, then the unit cost would become $310 per coach ($300 + ($1000 / 100)). If the next month the company made 50 coaches, then the unit cost = $320 per coach ($300 + ($1000 / 50)), a relatively minor difference.

=== Variance analysis ===
An important part of standard cost accounting is a [[Variance analysis (accounting)|variance analysis]], which breaks down the variation between actual cost and standard costs into various components (volume variation, material cost variation, labor cost variation, etc.) so managers can understand ''why costs were different from what was planned'' and take appropriate action to correct the situation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3413">'''ʻUliti Uata''' (born 24 August 1936&lt;ref name="gov"&gt;[http://www.pmo.gov.to/appointments/new-ministers-/2084-hon-uliti-uata-appointed-as-minister-for-health "Hon. 'Uliti Uata appointed as Minister for Health"], Tongan government portal, 27 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Tonga]]n politician. He is a member of the [[Human Rights and Democracy Movement]] and the [[Democratic Party of the Friendly Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taimionline.com/articles/1581 "MP ‘Uliti Uata tipped as new Health Minister"], Taimi Media Network, January 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was initially a businessman, running several businesses including "inter-islands ferries, general store, tourism, and others", until he entered politics and "divested himself" of his businesses so as to focus on his political career and on his family (he has ten children).&lt;ref name="gov" /&gt;

Uata was first elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Tonga]] in 1975, and served as a People's Representative until 1980.  After a break from politics, he contested the [[Tongan general election, 1993|1993 election]] and won the seat of [[Ha'apai]].  He has been re-elected in every subsequent election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.gov.to/about-parliament/members/people/207-uliti-uata.html Biography] on the website of the Tongan Parliament&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Uata was one of several pro-democracy MPs charged with [[sedition]] over speeches given before the [[2006 Nuku'alofa riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=32703 |title=Decision next week in Tonga on trial of sedition suspects |publisher=Radio New Zealand International |date=2007-06-02 |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The charges were dismissed in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=49080 |title=Five acquitted on charges of seditious conspiracy in Tonga |publisher=Radio new Zealand International |date=2009-09-13 |accessdate=2010-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uata was re-elected for an eighth term in the [[Tongan general election, 2010|2010 election]], for the new single-seat constituency of [[Haʻapai 13]], and nominated to the post of Minister of Health on 25 January 2011, following [[ʻAkilisi Pohiva]]'s resignation from that position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matangitonga.to/article/tonganews/government/20110126_tonga_uliti.shtml "New Minister of Health"], Matangi Tonga, 26 Jan 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In late June 2012, Uata -along with two other ministers- resigned from the Cabinet, so as to support a [[motion of no confidence]] tabled by his party (DPFI) against the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=69116 "Three Cabinet Ministers in Tonga resign ahead of confidence motion"], Radio New Zealand International, 25 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded as Minister for Health by [[Lord Tonga Tuʻiʻafitu|Lord Tuʻiʻafitu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://matangitonga.to/2012/07/09/pms-new-cabinet-short-ministers "PM's new Cabinet short of ministers"], ''Matangi Tonga'', 9 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
