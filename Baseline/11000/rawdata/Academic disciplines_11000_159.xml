The '''Atwater system''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | authors=D.A.T. Southgate, A.R.C. Food Research Institute, Norwich, UK|date=October 1981| url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/004/M2847E/M2847E00.HTM| accessdate=2006-03-09| title=The Relationship Between Food composition and Available Energy| work=Provisional Agenda Item 4.1.3, Joint FAO/WHO/UNU Expert Consultation on Energy and Protein Requirements, Rome, 5 to 17 October 1981| publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations, [[World Health Organization]], The [[United Nations University]]| id=ESN: FAO/WHO/UNU EPR/81/41 August 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; named after [[Wilbur Olin Atwater]], or derivatives of this system are used for the calculation of the available energy of foods. The system was developed largely from the experimental studies of Atwater and his colleagues in the later part of the 19th century and the early years of the 20th at [[Wesleyan University]] in [[Middletown, Connecticut]]. Its use has frequently been the cause of dispute, but no real alternatives have been proposed. As with the calculation of protein from total nitrogen, the Atwater system is a convention and its limitations can be seen in its derivation.

==Derivation==
Available energy (as used by Atwater) is equivalent to the modern usage of the term [[Metabolisable Energy|metabolisable energy]] (ME).

&lt;math&gt;{\text{Metabolisable Energy}} = \left(\text{Gross Energy in Food}\right) - \left(\text{Energy lost in Faeces, Urine, Secretions and Gases}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

In most studies on humans, losses in secretions and gases are ignored. The gross energy (GE) of a food, as measured by [[Calorimeter#Bomb calorimeters|bomb]] [[calorimetry]] is equal to the sum of the [[Heat of combustion|heats of combustion]] of the components – [[protein]] (GE&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;), fat (GE&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[carbohydrate]] (GE&lt;sub&gt;cho&lt;/sub&gt;) (by difference) in the proximate system.

&lt;math&gt;{GE} = {{GE}_p + {GE}_f + {GE}_{cho}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Atwater considered the energy value of feces in the same way.

&lt;math&gt;{GE}^F = {{GE}_p^F + {GE}_f^F + {GE}_{cho}^F}  \,&lt;/math&gt;

By measuring [[coefficients of availability]] or in modern terminology [[apparent digestibility]], Atwater derived a system for calculating faecal energy losses.

&lt;math&gt;\text{Digestible energy} = {{GE}_p(D_p)} + {{GE}_f(D_f)} + {{GE}_{cho}(D_{cho})}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''D&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''D&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''D&lt;sub&gt;cho&lt;/sub&gt;'' are respectively the digestibility coefficients of protein, fat and carbohydrate calculated as

&lt;math&gt;\frac {\text{intake}-\text{faecal excretion}}{\text{intake}}&lt;/math&gt;

for the constituent in question.

Urinary losses were calculated from the energy to nitrogen ratio in urine. Experimentally this was 7.9 kcal/g (33 kJ/g) urinary nitrogen and thus his equation for metabolisable energy became

&lt;math&gt;{ME} = \left ( {GE}_p - \frac {7.9} {6.25} \right ) D_p + {GE}_f D_f + {GE}_{cho} D_{cho}\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Gross energy values===
Atwater collected values from the literature and also measured the heat of combustion of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. These vary slightly depending on sources and Atwater derived weighted values for the gross heat of combustion of the protein, fat and carbohydrate in the typical mixed diet of his time. It has been argued that these weighted values are invalid for individual foods and for diets whose composition in terms of foodstuffs is different from those eaten in the USA in the early 20th century.

===Apparent digestibility coefficients===
Atwater measured a large number of digestibility coefficients for simple mixtures, and in substitution experiments derived values for individual foods. These he combined in a weighted fashion to derive values for mixed diets. When these were tested experimentally with mixed diets they did not give a good prediction, and Atwater adjusted the coefficients for mixed diets.

===Urinary correction===
The energy/nitrogen ratio in urine shows considerable variation and the energy/organic matter is less variable, but the energy/nitrogen value provided Atwater with a workable approach although this has caused some confusion and only applies for subjects in nitrogen balance.

==Modified system==
Based on the work of Atwater, it became common practice to calculate energy content of foods using 4 kcal/g for carbohydrates and proteins and 9 kcal/g for [[lipid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bijal Trivedi|title=The calorie delusion: Why food labels are wrong|journal=New Scientist|date=Jul 15, 2009|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327171-200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was later improved by [[Annabel Merrill]] and [[Bernice Watt]] of the [[USDA]], who derived a system whereby specific calorie conversion factors for different foods were proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Annabel Merrill|author2=Bernice Watt|title=Energy Values of Food ... basis and derivation|date=1973|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Data/Classics/ah74.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122060858/https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Data/Classics/ah74.pdf|archivedate=Nov 22, 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This takes cognizance of the fact that first the gross energy values of the protein, fats and carbohydrates from different food sources are different, and second, that the apparent digestibility of the components of different foods is different.

This system relies on having measured heats of combustion of a wide range of isolated proteins, fats and carbohydrates. It also depends on data from digestibility studies, where individual foods have been substituted for basal diets in order to measure the apparent digestibility coefficients for those foods. This approach is based on the assumption that there are no interactions between foods in a mixture in the intestine, and from a practical view point, such studies with humans are difficult to control with the required accuracy.

==Assumptions based on the use of carbohydrates by difference and the effects of dietary fibre==
The carbohydrate by difference approach presents several problems. First, it does not distinguish between sugars, starch and the unavailable carbohydrates (roughage, or "[[dietary fibre]]").

This affects first the gross energy that is assigned to carbohydrate—sucrose has a heat of combustion of 3.95&amp;nbsp;kcal/g (16.53&amp;nbsp;kJ/g) and starch 4.15&amp;nbsp;kcal/g (17.36&amp;nbsp;kJ/g).

Secondly it does not provide for the fact that sugars and starch are virtually completely digested and absorbed, and thus provide metabolisable energy equivalent to their heat of combustion.

The unavailable carbohydrates (dietary fibre) are degraded to a variable extent in the large bowel. The products of this microbial digestion are fatty acids, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (carbon dioxide), methane and hydrogen. The fatty acids (acetate, butyrate and propionate) are absorbed in the large intestine and provide some metabolisable energy. The extent of degradation depends on the source of the dietary fibre (its composition and state of division), and the individual consuming the dietary fibre. There is insufficient data to give firm guidance on the energy available from this source.

Finally dietary fibre affects faecal losses of nitrogen and fat. Whether the increased fat loss is due to an effect on small intestinal absorption is not clear. The increased faecal nitrogen losses on high fibre diets are probably due to an increased bacterial nitrogen content of the faeces. Both these effects however lead to reductions in apparent digestibility, and therefore  the Atwater system warrants small changes in the proper energy conversion factors for those diets.

==Theoretical and practical considerations relating to the calculation of energy values==

===Variations in heats of combustion of food constituents===

====Proteins====
The experimental evidence for the magnitude of this variation is very limited, but as the heats of combustion of the individual amino-acids are different it is reasonable to expect variations between different proteins. An observed range of from 5.48 for conglutin (from blue lupin) to 5.92 for Hordein (barley) was reported, which compares with Atwaters’ range of 5.27 for gelatin to 5.95 for wheat gluten. It is difficult to calculate expected values for a protein from amino-acid data, as some of the heats of combustion are not known accurately. Preliminary calculations on cow's milk suggest a value of around 5.5 kcal/g (23.0 kJ/g).

====Fats====
Analogously the experimental evidence is limited, but since the fatty acids differ in their heats of combustion one should expect fats to vary in heats of combustion. These differences are, however, relatively small – for example, breast milk fat has a calculated heat of combustion of 9.37 kcal/g (39.2 kJ/g) compared with that of cow milk fat of 9.19 kcal/g (38.5 kJ/g).

====Carbohydrates====
Monosaccharides have heats of combustion of around 3.75 kcal/g (15.7 kJ/g), disaccharides 3.95 kcal/g (16.5 kJ/g) and ''polysaccharides 4.15 to 4.20 kcal/g (17.4 to 17.6 kJ/g)''. The heat of hydrolysis is very small and these values are essentially equivalent when calculated on a monosaccharide basis. Thus 100 g sucrose gives on hydrolysis 105.6 g monosaccharide and 100 g starch gives on hydrolysis 110 g glucose.

===Apparent digestibility coefficients===
The human digestive tract is a very efficient organ, and the faecal excretion of nitrogenous material and fats is a small proportion (usually less than 10%) of the intake. Atwater recognised that the faecal excretion was a complex mixture of unabsorbed intestinal secretions, bacterial material and metabolites, sloughed mucosal cells, mucus, and only to a small extent, unabsorbed dietary components. This might be one reason why he chose to use ''availability'' rather than ''digestibility''. His view was that these faecal constituents were truly unavailable and that his apparent disregard of the nature of faecal excretion was justifiable in a practical context.

The ratio &lt;math&gt;\frac {\text{intake}-\text{faecal excretion}}{ \text{intake}},&lt;/math&gt; wherever faecal excretion is small, will approximate to unity and thus these ''coefficients'' have a low variance and have the appearance of constants. This is spurious since faecal excretion is variable even on a constant diet, and there is no evidence to suggest that faecal excretion is in fact related to intake in the way implied by these coefficients.

===Practical considerations in calculations of energy value of foods and diets===
The calculation of energy values must be regarded as an alternative to direct measurement, and therefore is likely to be associated with some inaccuracy when compared with direct assessment. These inaccuracies arise for a number of reasons

* Variations in [[food composition]]: Foods are biological mixtures and as such show considerable variation in composition, particularly in respect of water and fat content. This means that compositional values quoted for representative samples of foods in [[food composition table]]s do not necessarily apply to individual samples of foods. In studies where great accuracy is required, samples of the food consumed must be analysed.
* Measurements of food intake: In estimating energy intakes, measurements of food intake are made, and these are known to be subject to considerable uncertainty. Even in studies under very close supervision the errors in weighing individual food items are rarely less than ±5%. A certain degree of pragmatism must therefore be used when assessing procedures for calculating energy intakes, and many authors impute greater accuracy to quoted calculated energy intakes than is justifiable.
* Individual variation: Variations in individuals are seen in all human studies, and these variations are not allowed for in most calculations.

The theoretical and physiological objections to the assumptions inherent in the Atwater system are likely to result in errors much smaller than these practical matters. Conversion factors were derived from experimental studies with young infants, but these produced values for metabolisable energy intake that were insignificantly different from those obtained by direct application of the modified Atwater factors.

'''Byzantine glass''' objects highly resembled their [[Roman glass|earlier Roman counterparts]] during the fourth and early fifth centuries CE in both form and function. Over the course of the fifth century CE, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] glass blowers, based mostly in the area of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], developed a distinct Byzantine style. While glass vessels continued to serve as the primary vehicles for pouring and drinking liquid, glassware for lighting, currency and commodity weights, window panes, and glass [[tesserae]] for [[Byzantine mosaics|mosaics]] and enamels also surged in popularity. Following the [[Arab conquests]] of the seventh century CE, large quantities of glass were imported from the Levant, which continued to produce raw and manufactured glass.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Marylin, "Islamic Glass: A Brief History," The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, New Series Vol.44 No.2 (Autumn 1986), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars once believed that glassware was an expensive luxury good reserved for the upper strata of society, however, recent archaeological excavations have unearthed a considerable quantity of unadorned glassware intended for lower-class residents.&lt;ref&gt;Lightfoot, Christopher, "Glass Finds at Amorium," Dumbarton Oaks Papers, Vol.59 (2005), 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Chemical analyses of Byzantine glassware have demonstrated that Byzantine glass was composed of the same basic materials as Roman glass—combining sand-derived silica, a fluxing agent, and lime, as well as various coloring agents.

Roman and Byzantine glass-making was divided into two phases. The first, called "primary glass-making" involved the conversion of sand and stabilizer into raw glass. Separate workshops would then re-heat the glass and shape it into an object, in a phase referred to as "secondary glass-making". Although there is considerable archaeological evidence establishing primary glass-making sites, secondary glass-making sites remain difficult to pinpoint.

The largest number of glass production sites from the Early Byzantine period have been unearthed in Syria and Palestine, as well as Egypt. Glass factories have also been discovered in Greece ([[Corinth]], [[Thessoloniki]]) and Asia Minor.&lt;ref&gt;Antonaras, Anastassios, "The Production and Uses of Glass in Byzantine Thessaloniki," in New Light on Old Glass, ed. by Christopher Entwistle and Liz James, (London: The British Museum, 2013), 189-198.&lt;/ref&gt;  A chemical analysis of sixth-century Byzantine glass weights demonstrated that glass was also manufactured in [[Carthage]] and along the [[Danube River]].&lt;ref&gt;Schibille, Nadine, Meek, Andrew, Benguez, Tobias, Entwistle, Chris, Avisseau-Broustet Mathilde, Da Mota, Henrique, Gratuze, Bernard, "Comprehensive Chemical Characterization of Byzantine Glass Weights," PLoS One Vol.11, no.12 (Dec.2016). e0168289.&lt;/ref&gt;  Literary sources refer to glass-making sites in [[Constantinople]], Emesa ([[Homs, Syria]]), and various Egyptian towns.

==Labor==
Though some towns were home to glass-maker [[guild]]s, most Byzantine glass-makers were independent entrepreneurs.  Glass-workers could be either male or female. An extant glass-making contract from [[Armenia]] mentions a woman glass manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, E. Marianne,  "Glass Producers in Late Antique and Byzantine Papyri,"  in New Light on Old Glass, ed. by Christopher Entwistle and Liz James, (London: The British Museum, 2013), 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glass-making styles and techniques by object==
Glass vessel shapes in the Byzantine period did not deviate greatly from those of the high Roman period. Beginning in the late fifth century, glassblowers in the near east produced increasingly larger vessels.  They also introduced the folded, stemmed foot.  In the sixth and seventh centuries Byzantine glass vessels typically features a delicate u-shaped mouth.  A number of "classical" Roman glassware shapes were phased out by the fifth century including: bowls, flat- bottomed cups and beakers, and footed wine jugs featuring trefoil mouths.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, E.

A major innovation of the Byzantine period was the invention of the glass lamp. Glass lamps are first attested in the first half of the fourth century CE in Palestine, where they began to replace the clay lamps in use at the time as they were much more efficient.  By the middle of the fifth century their use was rapidly spreading westward. Initially these lamps were shaped just like drinking vessels, though the number of shapes expanded to seventeen over the course of the sixth and seventh centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, E. Marianne,  Roman Byzantine, and Early Medieval Glass 10 BCE-700 CE : Ernesto Wolf Collection, (Ostfildern-Ruit: Haje Cantz,2001), 262.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the "[[Triumph of Orthodoxy]]" in 843 CE, [[Byzantine enamel|enamel]] relief icons became the predominant form of iconography in Byzantium.&lt;ref&gt;Pentcheva, Bissera V. "The Performative Icon, " The Art Bulletin, vol.88 no.4 (Dec.2006), 631-632.&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known example is the Michael the Archangel enamel from the treasury of [[St. Mark's Basilica]] in [[Venice]].

==Silver staining==

Similar bracelets have been found throughout the Byzantine empire.&lt;ref&gt;Pilosi, Lisa, Whitehouse, David, "Early Islamic and Byzantine Silver Stain," in New Light on Old Glass, ed. by Christopher Entwistle and Liz James, (London: The British Museum, 2013), 334.&lt;/ref&gt;  ]]
In the middle Byzantine period, Byzantine glass-makers adopted [[silver-staining]] techniques from the Arab world. Silver-stained glass is created by applying a metallic compound, mixed with a "carrier" of clay or ochre to the surface of the glass object, then the glass is fired below the softening point of the glass. This process results in the breakdown of the smeared compound and its transition into the body of the glass object, creating a "stained" effect. Depending on the makeup of the compound and the "carrier" this process can lead to a wide array of colors. While the Arabs began creating silver-stained glass objects in the late eighth century in Egypt, the first Byzantine silver-stained object has been dated to the ninth century. The most common items featuring Byzantine silver-stain are simple glass bracelets, dating from the tenth to thirteenth centuries, and being discovered across the Byzantine world, from Greece to Anatolia. The most famous example of Byzantine silver-staining is the interior inscription of the beautiful San Marco bowl, dated to the "[[Macedonian Renaissance]]" of the tenth century. Several fragments of silver-stained window glass have been discovered. Although silver staining was practiced by the Byzantines, silver-stained works were not as ubiquitous in Byzantium as they were to become in late Medieval Europe. However, the widespread use of silver-staining in Byzantium could in part explain the transmission of silver-stain technique from the Arab world to Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Pilosi, Lisa, Whitehouse, David, "Early Islamic and Byzantine Silver Stain," in New Light on Old Glass, ed. by Christopher Entwistle and Liz James, (London: The British Museum, 2013), 329-337.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cellular agriculture''' focuses on the production of agriculture products from cell cultures using a combination of [[biotechnology]], [[tissue engineering]], [[molecular biology]], and [[synthetic biology]] to create and design new methods of producing proteins, fats, and tissues that would otherwise come from traditional agriculture.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://agfundernews.com/closer-look-cellular-agriculture-and-the-processes-defining-it.html|title=A Closer Look at Cellular Agriculture and the Processes Defining It - AgFunderNews|date=2016-07-05|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers to the creation of animal products such as meat, milk, and eggs, produced in cell culture rather than raising and slaughtering farmed livestock.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00963402.2017.1413059|title=Cellular agriculture: The coming revolution in food production|journal = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|pages = 32–35|volume = 74|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/00963402.2017.1413059|first = CS|last = Mattick|pmid=10659856|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most well known cellular agriculture concept is [[cultured meat]].

== History ==
{{Main|Timeline of cellular agriculture}}

Although cellular agriculture is a nascent scientific discipline, cellular agriculture products were first commercialized in the early 20th century with insulin and rennet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.new-harvest.org/about|title=About|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 24, 1990, the FDA approved a bacteria that had been genetically engineered to produce rennet, making it the first genetically engineered product for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-24/news/mn-681_1_genetically-engineered-product-for-food|title=FDA approves 1st genetically engineered product for food|last=|first=|date=1990-03-24|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rennet is a mixture of enzymes that turns milk into curds and whey in cheese making.  Traditionally, rennet is extracted from the inner lining of the fourth stomach of calves. Today, cheese making processes use rennet enzymes from genetically engineered bacteria, fungi, or yeasts because they are unadulterated, more consistent, and less expensive than animal-derived rennet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncbe.reading.ac.uk/ncbe/gmfood/chymosin.html|title=Case Studies: Chymosin|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522102627/http://www.ncbe.reading.ac.uk/ncbe/gmfood/chymosin.html|archivedate=2016-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Jason Gaverick Matheny|Jason Matheny]] founded [[New Harvest]] which was initially a cultured-meat advocacy organization whose mission today is to "accelerate breakthroughs in cellular agriculture."&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.new-harvest.org/about|title=History|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Harvest is the only organization focused exclusively on advancing the field of cellular agriculture and is funding the first cellular agriculture PhD at Tufts University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.new-harvest.org/cellular_agriculture_tufts_university|title=Cellular Agriculture at Tufts University.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2014, ''IndieBio'', a synthetic biology accelerator in San Francisco, has incubated several cellular agriculture startups, hosting Muufri (making milk from cell culture), Clara Foods (making egg whites from cell culture), Gelzen (making gelatin from bacteria and yeast), Afineur (making cultured coffee beans) and Pembient (biofabricating rhino horn). Muufri and Clara Foods were both launched by New Harvest.

In 2015, ''[[Mercy for Animals]]'' created its sister organization called ''[[The Good Food Institute|Good Food Institute]]'', which promotes cellular agriculture meat and dairy alternatives in addition to plant-based options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vegnews.com/articles/page.do?pageId=7568&amp;catId=1|title=News article|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 13, 2016, New Harvest hosted the world's first international conference on cellular agriculture in San Francisco, California.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The day after the conference, New Harvest hosted the first closed-door workshop for industry, academic and government stakeholders in cellular agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@NewHarvestOrg/notes-from-the-2016-cellular-agriculture-innovators-workshop-c97d4df4eabb#.dow8i6r2m|title=Notes from the 2016 Cellular Agriculture Innovators’ Workshop|last=Harvest|first=New|date=2016-08-04|website=Medium|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research tools ==
Several key research tools are at the foundation of research in cellular agriculture. These include:

=== Cell lines ===
A fundamental missing piece in the advancement of cultured meat is the availability of the appropriate cellular materials. While some methods and protocols from human and mouse cell culture may apply to agricultural cellular materials, it has become clear that most do not. This is evidenced by the fact that established protocols for creating human and mouse embryonic stem cells have not succeeded in establishing ungulate embryonic stem cell lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007|title=Challenges and prospects for the establishment of embryonic stem cells of domesticated ungulates|journal=Animal Reproduction Science|volume=98|issue=|doi=10.1016/j.anireprosci.2006.10.009|pmid=17097839|via=|pages=147–68 | last1 = Keefer | first1 = CL | last2 = Pant | first2 = D | last3 = Blomberg | first3 = L | last4 = Talbot | first4 = NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2008|title=The pursuit of ES cell lines of domesticated ungulates|journal=Stem Cell Rev|volume=4|issue=|doi=10.1007/s12015-008-9026-0|pmid=18612851|via=|pages=235–54 | last1 = Talbot | first1 = NC | last2 = Le Ann | first2 = Blomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2016|title=Embryonic Stem Cells and Fetal Developmental Models|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-3483-6_5|journal=Fetal Stem Cells in Regenerative Medicine|volume=|issue=|doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-3483-6_5|pmid=|access-date=|via=|pages=81–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideal criteria for cell lines for the purpose of cultured meat production include: immortality, high proliferative ability, surface independence, serum independence, and tissue-forming ability. The specific cell types most suitable for cellular agriculture are likely to differ from species to species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013|title=Isolation and culture of bovine embryonic stem cells|journal=Epiblast Stem Cells|volume=1074|issue=|doi=10.1007/978-1-62703-628-3_9|pmid=23975809|via=|pages=111–23 | last1 = Cao | first1 = S | last2 = Wang | first2 = F | last3 = Liu | first3 = L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012|title=Why is it so difficult to derive pluripotent stem cells in domestic ungulates?|pmid=22913556|journal=Reprod Domest Anim|volume=47 Suppl 5|issue=|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0531.2012.02106.x|via=|pages=11–7 | last1 = Gandolfi | first1 = F | last2 = Pennarossa | first2 = G | last3 = Maffei | first3 = S | last4 = Brevini | first4 = T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Growth media ===
Today the status quo for growing animal tissue in culture involves the use of fetal bovine serum (FBS). FBS is a blood product extracted from fetal calves. This product supplies cells with nutrients and stimulating growth factors, but is unsustainable and resource-heavy to produce, with large batch-to-batch variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van der Valk|first=J|date=2010|title=Optimization of chemically defined cell culture media--replacing fetal bovine serum in mammalian in vitro methods|journal=Toxicol In Vitro|volume=24|issue=|doi=10.1016/j.tiv.2010.03.016|pmid=20362047|via=|pages=1053–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the creation of the cell lines, efforts to remove serum from the growth media are key to the advancement of cellular agriculture as fetal bovine serum has been the target of most criticisms of cellular agriculture and cultured meat production. It is likely that two different media formulations will be required for each cell type: a proliferation media, for growth, and a differentiation media, for maturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Agapakis|first=Christina|date=2012|title=Steak of the Art: The Fatal Flaws of In Vitro Meat|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2012/04/24/steak-of-the-art-the-fatal-flaws-of-in-vitro-meat/#.V6jP-Vcw3zI|journal=Discover Magazine|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scaling technologies ===
As biotechnological processes are scaled, experiments start to become increasingly expensive, as bioreactors of increasing volume will have to be created. Each increase in size will require a re-optimization of various parameters such as unit operations, fluid dynamics, mass transfer and reaction kinetics.

=== Scaffold materials ===
For cells to form tissue, it is helpful for a material scaffold to be added to provide structure. Scaffolds are crucial for cells to form tissues larger than 100&amp;nbsp;µm across. An ideal scaffold must be non-toxic for the cells, edible, and allow for the flow of nutrients and oxygen. It must also be cheap and easy to produce on a large scale without the need for animals.

=== 3D tissue systems ===
The final phase for creating cultured meat involves bringing together all the previous pieces of research to create large (&gt;100&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter) pieces of tissue that can be made of mass-produced cells without the need of serum, where the scaffold is suitable for cells and humans.

== Applications ==
Cellular agriculture is a scientific field that designs new mechanisms to produce existing agriculture products. While the majority of discussion has been around food applications, particular cultured meat, cellular agriculture can be used to create any kind of agricultural product, including those that never involved animals to begin with, like Gingko Biowork's fragrances.

Over the last several years, several cellular agriculture start-ups have been created applying cellular agriculture to make a number of agricultural products and consumables.

'''The Center for Jewish–Christian Understanding and Cooperation''' or '''CJCUC''' is an educational institution at which Christians who tour Israel can study the [[Hebrew Bible]] with [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbis and learn about the Hebraic roots of Christianity. The center was established in [[Efrat]] in 2008 by Rabbi Dr. [[Shlomo Riskin]], who has been described as "the most prominent rabbinic spokesperson to Christian Zionists".&lt;ref name=jesus&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14755610.2011.633537|title=The Messiah and Rabbi Jesus: Policing the Jewish–Christian border in Christian Zionism|journal=Culture and Religion: An Interdisciplinary Journal|first=Faydra L.|last=Shapiro|year=2012|volume=12|issue=4|pages=463–477|doi=10.1080/14755610.2011.633537}}&lt;/ref&gt; CJCUC partners with major Christian interfaith organizations such as [[Christians United for Israel]] and the [[International Christian Embassy Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=jesus/&gt;

== History ==
The ideological groundwork, which led to the eventual establishment of CJCUC in 2008, began to take shape almost 50 years beforehand. In 1964, Rabbi [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], the teacher and mentor of CJCUC's Chancellor and Founder, [[Shlomo Riskin]], published an essay entitled "Confrontation"&lt;ref&gt;''Confrontation'', Tradition 6:2 p5-9, 1964. Reprinted in "A Treasury of Tradition", Hebrew Publishing Co, NY, 1967. – {{OCLC|1974913}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he expounded his views on interfaith dialogue and carefully drew out guidelines which permitted such a dialogue and, in the view of Riskin, not only permitted it but rendered it necessary.

At around the same time, fundamental ideological shifts were forming within the ranks of the Catholic Church, and a year after Soloveitchik's essay was published, [[The Holy See]] issued ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', the Declaration on the Relation of the Church with Non-Christian Religions. ''Nostra aetate'' absolved the Jews from the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], and admitted that religious antisemitism had a significant role in laying the foundation for the atrocities perpetrated against the Jewish people.

Riskin's academic plunge into Jewish–Christian relations began in the early 1960s when he attended seminars, held by Professor [[David Flusser]], about the Christian Gospels at The [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. As an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jew]], he could pinpoint the parallels for Jesus' teachings within the Hebrew scripture.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.scribd.com/doc/93213735/gadol-2 Shabat HaGadol]'' – translated from Hebrew – page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

After settling in Efrat, Riskin began to engage with the Christian world. Most of the Christian visitors to Efrat, those who came to hear and learn, were [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]]. He formed relations with Rev. Robert Stearns of Eagles' Wings and with Pastor [[John Hagee]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.scribd.com/doc/93213735/gadol-2 Shabat HaGadol]'' – translated from Hebrew – page 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shabbat-gadol"&gt;{{cite web|language=he|url=https://musaf-shabbat.com/2012/05/17/%D7%93%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%92-%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%99-%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A6%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%97%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%91%D7%94-%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%95%D7%93%D7%A9%D7%AA-%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%94/|title=Jewish–Christian Dialogue: Rethinking|first=Zur|last=Erlich|publisher=[[Makor Rishon]]|date=17 May 2012|access-date=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

of biblical sites such as nearby [[Jerusalem]], the Path of the Patriarchs and the Herodian wells.
Among the subjects that the seminar series includes are Jewish–Christian Relations; the Theology
of Biblical Holidays; Covenant and Mission; [[The Ten Commandments]]; Satan, Evil and Free Will;
[[Judaism]] and the Ministry of Jesus; and Human Life Created in the Image of God.

The center runs educational seminars for students and faculty of Catholic and Protestant seminaries in the United States, Canada, and Europe. It has appointed North American and European directors to coordinate relations with religious leaders on these continents.

CJCUC has established a Theological Think Tank, the Institute for Theological Inquiry (ITI),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standardnewswire.com/news/890647512.html "CJCUC Announces the Publication of Covenant &amp; Hope"] – standardnewswire.com – 10 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; headed by Rabbi [[Eugene Korn]] and Dr. [[Robert Jenson]] of the [[Witherspoon Institute]], which consists of international scholars and theologians whose tasks are to clarify areas of Jewish and Christian theological agreement and disagreement,&lt;ref&gt;''Covenant and Hope – Christian and Jewish Reflections'' – Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. – July 2012 – {{ISBN|978-0802867049}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as identify areas of fruitful cooperation. The topics focus on past and present Jewish–Christian Relations, [[Covenant (biblical)|Covenant]], [[Salvation]], Biblical Hermeneutics, Religion and Violence, [[Ethical Monotheism]], and
[[Messianism]].

In May 2011, CJCUC facilitated and sponsored a [[Yale University]] student group consisting of Orthodox Jewish and [[Evangelical Christians]] to learn the fundamentals of Jewish–Christian relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hebraiccenter.org/portal/web/guest/covenant_and_witness|title=HHCC Makes Statement on Christian-Jewish Relations|publisher=Hebraic Heritage Christian Center|date=23 May 2011|accessdate=23 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011065122/http://hebraiccenter.org/portal/web/guest/covenant_and_witness#|archive-date=11 October 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, CJCUC took Latin American priests and rabbis to learn the fundamentals of Jewish-Catholic relations in the backdrop of the Holy Land.&lt;ref name=wjc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Metro/Features/Priestly-blessings|title=Latin American Catholics and Jews share a trip to the Holy Land to bridge gaps|first=Deborah|last=Danan|date=3 March 2012|accessdate=23 October 2014|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, CJCUC partnered with Christians United for Israel to bring 30 Evangelical pastors from the U.S. to learn the fundamentals of Jewish–Christian relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765586635/Jews-and-Christian-Evangelicals-work-to-improve-communication.html|title=Jews and Christian Evangelicals work to improve communication|work=[[Deseret News]]|date=28 June 2012|accessdate=23 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013223952/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765586635/Jews-and-Christian-Evangelicals-work-to-improve-communication.html#|archive-date=13 October 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, CJCUC co-sponsored the visit of more than 160 pastors to Israel through the [[Christians United for Israel]] organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cufi.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=12351|title=CUFI Takes More than 160 Pastors to Israel (press release)|date=26 February 2013|accessdate=23 October 2014|publisher=[[Christians United for Israel]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211748/http://www.cufi.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=12351#|archive-date=23 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, on a visit to Oklahoma, Rabbi Riskin unveiled plans for historic high school curricula, being worked on in a joint effort with the government of Israel, detailing advancements in Jewish–Christian relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://city-sentinel.com/2015/02/rabbi-riskin-historic-curriculum/|title=Rabbi Riskin announces historic curriculum for Israeli schools during visit to Oklahoma|first=Darla|last=Shelden|date=25 February 2015|accessdate=8 March 2015|work=City-Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, CJCUC announced that it was moving its center of operations from [[Efrat]] to the [[Bible Lands Museum]] in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=en|url=http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/6802578149.html|title=The Land of the Bible Meets the Word of the Bible|website=Christian Newswire|date=14 July 2016|access-date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=en|url=http://us3.campaign-archive2.com/?u=68fbc11d9f14b345f72e71461&amp;id=0cd33a9201|title=CJCUC is Moving to Jerusalem|website=[[MailChimp]]|date=14 July 2016|access-date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CJCUC has received funds from Israel's Hertog family, [[Paul Singer (businessman)|Paul Singer]] Foundation, Zion's Gate International Foundation, [[Justice Ministry (Israel)|Ministry of Justice]], and [[John Hagee]] Ministries.

=== Day to Praise ===
{{Main article|Day to Praise}}

Later that year, in 2015, during the festival of [[Sukkot]], CJCUC, together with its founder, Rabbi [[Shlomo Riskin]], the chief rabbi of [[Efrat]], hosted an interfaith event in Efrat in which 200 Christians and Jews came together to sing the praises of God in unity. Riskin said that ''"the prayer event will help usher in the [[Messianic Age]]."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.breakingisraelnews.com/51082/rabbi-shlomo-riskin-interfaith-prayer-bringing-us-closer-to-messianic-age-biblical-zionism/|title=Rabbi Shlomo Riskin: Interfaith Prayer "Bringing Us Closer" to Messianic Age|first= Adam Eliyahu|last=Berkowitz|publisher=Breaking Israel News|date=14 October 2015|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blessing Bethlehem ===
{{Main article|Blessing Bethlehem}}
CJCUC created the first food voucher program to help financially disadvantaged Christian Arabs living in the Land.

In September 2016, CJCUC's Associate Director, Rabbi [[Pesach Wolicki]], launched the "[[Blessing Bethlehem]]" fundraising initiative at the [[LifeLight Festival]] in [[Sioux Falls]], [[South Dakota]] in and effort to create a food giveaway program for persecuted Christians in [[Bethlehem]] and the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2016/09/02/food-giveaway-inspires-outreach-israel/89767158/|title=Food giveaway inspires outreach to Israel|first=John|last=Hult|publisher=[[Argus Leader]]|date=2 September 2016|access-date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social activism ===
In October 2013, CJCUC Executive Director, David Nekrutman published a controversial appeal for funds from Jews to support the purchase of a permanent site for the Christian-Arab church of Pastor Steven Khoury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jewishisrael.ning.com/page/cjcuc-s-executive-director-david-nekrutman-appeals-for-funds-to-b|title=A Call to Action|first=David|last=Nekrutman|publisher=The Jerusalem Post Christian Edition|date=October 2013|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jewishisrael.ning.com/profiles/blogs/director-of-rabbi-riskin-s-interfaith-center-appeals-for-funding-|title=Director of Rabbi Riskin's Interfaith Center Appeals for Funding to Build Church in Jerusalem|work=Jewish Israel|date=27 October 2013|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, CJCUC sponsored an interfaith Latin American clergy mission that visited the Ziv Medical Center in Safed, Israel, donating supplies to wounded Syrian civil war refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jns.org/news-briefs/2014/5/19/latin-american-christian-clergy-mission-visits-syrian-refugees-in-israeli-hospital#.U5q7utSSyiA=|title=Latin American clergy mission visits Syrian refugees in Israeli hospital|date=19 May 2014|accessdate=23 October 2014|work=jns.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011203006/http://www.jns.org/news-briefs/2014/5/19/latin-american-christian-clergy-mission-visits-syrian-refugees-in-israeli-hospital#.U5q7utSSyiA=#.U5q7utSSyiA=|archive-date=11 October 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bristolpress.com/articles/2014/05/23/state_-_nation/doc537fd96dc1727206700304.txt|title=Latin American clergy visit Syrian refugees in Israeli hospital|publisher=The Bristol Press|date=23 May 2014|accessdate=23 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005100813/http://bristolpress.com/articles/2014/05/23/state_-_nation/doc537fd96dc1727206700304.txt#|archive-date=5 October 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 2015 piece for [[The Times of Israel]], Executive Director, David Nekrutman appealed to the Israeli [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Ministry of Education]] in regards to budget cuts and equal funding for Christian Schools in Israel citing these budget cuts as ''"collateral damage"'' of internal political issues and stating that these issues ''"should never oppress minority populations"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/collateral-damage/|title=Collateral Damage|first=David|last=Nekrutman|publisher=[[The Times of Israel]]|date=12 September 2015|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, together with The [[Pave the Way Foundation]] (PTWF) and the [[Galilee Center for Studies in Jewish-Christian Relations]] (CSJCR), CJCUC initiated an international campaign urging the Israeli Prime Minister and Education Ministry to Save Christian Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://christiannewswire.com/news/1492376713.html|title=International Campaign Urges Israeli Prime Minister to Save Christian Education|first=|last=|publisher=Christian News Wire|date=17 September 2015|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accomplishments ==
CJCUC accomplishments include:

* In January 2012, CJCUC received the honorary title of Goodwill Ambassador for Jewish–Christian Relations from [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu]]. In his letter, the prime minister writes: ''"I believe you are uniquely suited to be an Ambassador of Goodwill for the State of Israel to strengthen relations between Jews and Christians throughout the world. I know that you will continue to promote understanding between Jews and Christians in a spirit of mutual respect that will enable both to work together to better mankind."''

* CJCUC is on the official body between the [[Holy See]] and the Jewish people via IJCIC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/9962316591.html |title=CJCUC Joins IJCIR As Partner|work=Christian Newswire|date=29 March 2011|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, Riskin had an audience with [[Pope Benedict XVI]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/rabbi-and-pope-discuss-jewish-christian-cooperation-in-israel/|title=Rabbi and Pope discuss Jewish-Christian cooperation in Israel|date=17 January 2011|accessdate=23 October 2014|work=[[Catholic News Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 2013, CJCUC's Academic Director Rabbi [[Eugene Korn]], along with other members of the organized Jewish establishment, met with [[Pope Francis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://embassies.gov.il/holysee-en/NewsAndEvents/Pages/Pope-Francis-meets-with-.aspx |title=Pope Francis meets the Jewish delegation|publisher=Embassy of Israel to the Holy See|date=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, he was the main speaker at [[Christians United for Israel|CUFI's]] first international event in Nairobi where over 1,500 Africans attended to support Israel.

== Orthodox Rabbinic Statement on Christianity ==
On 3 December 2015, CJCUC spearheaded a petition of orthodox rabbis from around the world calling for increased partnership between Jews and Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.breakingisraelnews.com/55561/groundbreaking-petition-signed-leading-rabbis-calls-increased-partnership-between-jews-christians-biblical-zionism/|title=Groundbreaking Petition Signed by Leading Rabbis Calls for Increased Partnership Between Jews and Christians|first= Adam Eliyahu|last=Berkowitz|publisher=Breaking Israel News|date=7 December 2015|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/national/modern-orthodox-leaders-bless-interfaith-dialogue|title=Modern Orthodox Leaders Bless Interfaith Dialogue|first=Steve|last=Lipman|publisher=[[The Jewish Week]]|date=8 December 2015|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2015/12/11/Vatican-Orthodox-rabbis-issue-interfaith-statements-affirming-each-other-s-faith/stories/201512110164|title=Vatican, Orthodox rabbis issue interfaith statements affirming each other's faith|first=Peter|last=Smith|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=11 December 2015|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-shmuly-yanklowitz/towards-jewish-christian-reconciliation_b_9133926.html|title=Towards Jewish-Christian Reconciliation &amp; Partnership|first=Rabbi Shmuly|last=Yanklowitz|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=3 February 2016|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Blogs/Intellectual-Judaism/Mutual-Judeo-Christian-spiritual-foundation-of-Judaism-and-Christianity-444183|title=Mutual Judeo-Christian spiritual foundation of Judaism and Christianity|first=VLADIMIR|last=MINKOV|publisher=[[Jerusalem Post]]|date=7 February 2016|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vaticanradio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2015/12/10/orthodox_rabbis_issue_groundbreaking_statement_on_christians/1193458|title=Orthodox Rabbis issue groundbreaking statement on Christianity|publisher=[[Vatican Radio]]|date=10 December 2015|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unprecedented statement, entitled ''"To Do the Will of Our Father in Heaven: Toward a Partnership between Jews and Christians"'', was initially signed by over 25 prominent Orthodox rabbis in Israel, United States, and Europe,&lt;ref name="vaticanradio" /&gt; and now has over 60 signatories.&lt;ref name="orthodox-rabbinic-statement-on-christianity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cjcuc.com/site/2015/12/03/orthodox-rabbinic-statement-on-christianity/|title=Orthodox Rabbinic Statement on Christianity – To Do the Will of Our Father in Heaven – Toward a Partnership between Jews and Christians|website=CJCUC|date=3 December 2015|access-date=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{pull quote|The real importance of this Orthodox statement is that it calls for fraternal partnership between Jewish and Christian religious leaders, while also acknowledging the positive theological status of the Christian faith. Jews and Christians must be in the forefront of teaching basic moral values to the world.|author=Rabbi [[Shlomo Riskin]]|source=[[Vatican Radio]]&lt;ref name="vaticanradio" /&gt;}}

In May 2017, the statement was approbated by Rabbi [[Abraham Skorka]] of [[Argentina]] and Cardinal [[Christoph Schönborn]] [[Archbishop of Vienna]].&lt;ref name="orthodox-rabbinic-statement-on-christianity" /&gt;

[[Image:Chromosome.svg|thumb|In the diagram, (1) refers to a chromatid: one-half of two identical threadlike strands of a replicated [[chromosome]]. During cell division, the identical copies (called a "[[Sister chromatids|sister chromatid pair]]") are joined at the region called the [[centromere]] (2). Once the paired sister chromatids have separated from one another (in the [[anaphase]] of  [[mitosis]]) each is known as a daughter chromosome. The short arm of the right chromatid (3), and the long arm of the right chromatid (4), are also marked.]]

A '''chromatid''' (Greek ''khrōmat-'' 'color' + ''-id'') is one copy of a newly copied [[chromosome]] which is still joined to the original chromosome by a single centromere. 

Before replication, one chromosome is composed of one [[DNA]] molecule. Following replication, each chromosome is composed of two DNA molecules; in other words, [[DNA replication]] itself increases the amount of DNA but does ''not'' increase the number of chromosomes. The two identical copies—each forming one half of the replicated chromosome—are called chromatids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biology.about.com/library/glossary/bldefchromatid.htm|title=What is a Chromatid?|author=|date=|website=About.com|access-date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the later stages of cell division these chromatids separate longitudinally to become individual chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chromatid|title=Definition of CHROMATID|author=|date=|website=www.Merriam-Webster.com|access-date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromatid pairs are normally genetically identical, and said to be [[Zygosity|homozygous]]; however, if mutation(s) occur, they will present slight differences, in which case they are [[Zygosity|heterozygous]]. The pairing of chromatids should not be confused with the [[ploidy]] of an organism, which is the number of [[Homologous chromosome|homologous versions]] of a chromosome.

[[Chromonema]] is the fibre-like structure in [[prophase]] in the primary stage of [[DNA condensation]]. In [[metaphase]], they are called chromatids.

==Sister chromatids==
{{Main|Sister chromatids}}
Chromatids may be sister or non-sister chromatids. A [[sister chromatid]] is either one of the two chromatids of the same [[chromosome]] joined together by a common [[centromere]]. A pair of sister chromatids is called a '''dyad'''. Once sister chromatids have separated (during the [[anaphase]] of mitosis or the anaphase II of [[meiosis]] during [[sexual reproduction]]), they are again called chromosomes. Although having the same genetic mass as the individual chromatids that made up its parent, the daughter "molecules" are called chromosomes in a similar way that one child of a pair of twins is not referred to as a single [[twin]]. 
The DNA sequence of two sister chromatids is completely identical (apart from very rare DNA copying errors).

[[Sister chromatid exchange]] (SCE) is the exchange of genetic information between two [[sister chromatids]].  SCEs can occur during [[mitosis]] or [[meiosis]].  SCEs appear to primarily reflect DNA recombinational [[DNA repair|repair]] processes responding to [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]] (see articles [[Sister chromatids]] and [[Sister chromatid exchange]]).

''Non-sister chromatids'', on the other hand, refers to either of the two chromatids of paired [[homologous chromosome]]s, that is, the pairing of a paternal chromosome and a maternal chromosome. In [[chromosomal crossover]]s, non-sister (homologous) chromatids form [[Chiasma (genetics)|chiasmata]] to exchange genetic material during the [[prophase I]] of [[meiosis]] (See [[Homologous recombination]]).

However, the cleaner fish may sometimes cheat and consume mucus or tissue, thus creating a form of [[parasitism]].&lt;ref name=Gingins2013&gt;Gingins, S (2013) [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1761/20130553.full.pdf+html "Power and temptation cause shifts between exploitation and cooperation in a cleaner wrasse mutualism"], ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B'', '''280''' (1761): 20130553. {{doi|10.1098/rspb.2013.0553}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide variety of fish including [[wrasse]], [[cichlid]]s, [[catfish]], [[pipefish]], and [[goby|gobies]] display cleaning behaviors. Similar behavior is found in other groups of animals, such as [[cleaner shrimp]]s.

Cleaner fish advertise their services with [[animal coloration|conspicuous coloration]], often displaying a brilliant blue stripe that spans the length of the body. This adaptation has evolved independently in different species of cleaner fish, making it an example of [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, K.L., [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982209013037 "Blue and Yellow Signal Cleaning Behavior in Coral Reef Fishes"], "Current Biology", 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Other species of fish, called mimics, imitate the behavior and phenotype of cleaner fish to gain access to client fish tissue. This is another example of convergent evolution.&lt;ref name=Cheney2005&gt;Cheney, K.L. (2005) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1559983/ "Frequency-dependent success of aggressive mimics in a cleaning symbiosis"], ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B'', '''272''' (1581): 2635-2639.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diversity of cleaner fish==

===Marine fishes===
[[File:Arothron hispidus is being cleaned by Hawaiian cleaner wrasses, Labroides phthirophagus 1.jpg|thumb|A [[disruptive coloration|disruptively patterned]] [[white-spotted puffer]] being cleaned by a conspicuously coloured [[Hawaiian cleaner wrasse]]]]
[[File:Elacatinus evelynae.jpg|thumb|Caribbean cleaning goby ''[[Elacatinus evelynae]]'']]
[[File:Marine Iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) feeding underwater off Fernandina Island, Galápagos Islands.jpg|thumb|The cleaning recipient is typically another fish, but it can also involve other groups, like this [[Cortez rainbow wrasse]] cleaning a [[marine iguana]]]]

The best known cleaner fish are the [[bluestreak cleaner wrasse|cleaner wrasse]]s of the genus ''[[Labroides]]'' found on coral reefs in the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]. These small fish maintain so-called [[cleaning stations]] where other fish, known as hosts, congregate and perform specific movements to attract the attention of the cleaner fish. Remarkably, these small cleaner fish safely clean large predatory fish that would otherwise eat small fish such as these.&lt;ref&gt;Helfman G., Collette B., &amp; Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, p 380, 1997, {{ISBN|0-86542-256-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While they derive the majority of their nutrients by removing ectoparasites, cleaner fish also feed on the mucus and tissue of the client fish, as these food sources have greater nutritional value. There is however a risk of terminating the cleaning interaction if the cleaner is too aggressive,  taking too much mucus and tissue. Because of this, cleaners seek a balance in feeding between ectoparasites and mucus or tissue.&lt;ref name=Gingins2013 /&gt;

Cleaning behaviors have been observed in a number of other fish groups. Neon [[Goby|gobies]] of the genera ''[[Gobiosoma]]'' and ''[[Elacatinus]]'' provide a cleaning service similar to the cleaner wrasses, though this time on reefs in the [[Atlantic Ocean|western Atlantic]], providing a good example of [[convergent evolution]]. Unlike the cleaner wrasses, they also eat a variety of small animals as well being cleaner fish, and generally do well in aquaria.&lt;ref name="fenner"&gt;Fenner, Robert M (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=9BA-PgAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22The+Conscientious+Marine+Aquarist%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ibeJUsXsDoPAkgW-mYCIBA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA ''The Conscientious Marine Aquarist''] TFH Publications, pp 282-283. {{ISBN|1-890087-02-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Caribbean cleaning goby]] (''Elacatinus evelynae'') gladly eat scales and mucus from the host when the ectoparasites it normally feeds on are scarce, making the relationship somewhat less than mutually beneficial. The [[symbiosis]] does not break down because the abundance of these parasites varies significantly seasonally and spatially, and the overall benefit to the larger fish outweighs any cheating on the part of the smaller.&lt;ref name = CheneyCote2005&gt;Cheney, K.L. and M. Côté (2005) [http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/2/162.full.pdf+html "Mutualism or parasitism? The variable outcome of cleaning symbioses"] ''Biology Letters'', '''1'''(2): 162-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brackish water fish===
An interesting example of a cleaning symbiosis has been observed between two [[brackish water]] [[Cichlidae|cichlids]] of the genus ''[[Etroplus]]'' from [[South Asia]]. The small species ''[[Etroplus maculatus]]'' is the cleaner fish, and the much larger ''[[Etroplus suratensis]]'' is the host that receives the cleaning service.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Wyman and Jack A. Ward (1972). A Cleaning Symbiosis between the Cichlid Fishes Etroplus maculatus and Etroplus suratensis. I. Description and Possible Evolution. Copeia, Vol. 1972, No. 4, pp. 834-838.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freshwater fish===
Cleaning has infrequently been observed in fresh waters compared to marine waters, but at least in part this is possibly related to fewer observers (such as divers) in the former habitat compared to the latter.&lt;ref name=Carvalho2007&gt;{{cite book | author1=Carvalho, L.N. | author2=J.

==Mimicry==
{{further|Aggressive mimicry|Cleaning symbiosis}}
[[File:Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos (Blue-lined Sabertooth Blenny).jpg|thumb|right|The [[bluestriped fangblenny]] is an [[aggressive mimicry|aggressive mimic]] of the cleaner wrasse.]]

Mimic species have evolved body forms, patterns, and colors which imitate other species to gain a competitive advantage.&lt;ref name=Cheney2008&gt;Cheney, K.L. (2008) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17986437 "Facultative mimicry: cues for colour change and colour accuracy in a coral reef fish"], ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B'', ''' 275''' (1631): 117–122.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most studied examples of mimicry on coral reefs is the relationship between the [[aggressive mimicry|aggressive mimic]] ''Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos'' (the [[bluestriped fangblenny]]) and the cleaner wrasse model ''[[Labroides dimidiatus]]''. By appearing like ''L. dimidiatus'', ''P. rhinorhynchos'' is able to approach and subsequently feed on the tissue and scales of client fish while posing as a cleaner.&lt;ref name=Cheney2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cheney2012&gt;Cheney, K.L. (2012) [http://171.66.127.192/content/early/2011/08/16/rsbl.2011.0687.full.pdf+html "Cleaner wrasse mimics inflict higher costs on their models when they are more aggressive towards signal receivers"] ''Biology Letters'', {{doi|10.1098/rsbl.2011.0687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of the cleaner mimic, ''P. rhinorhynchos'', has a negative impact on the foraging success of the cleaner model ''L. dimidiatus''.&lt;ref name=Cheney2012 /&gt; ''P. rhinorhynchos'' feeds by eating the tissue and scales of client fish, making client fish much more cautious while at cleaning stations. More aggressive mimics have a greater negative impact on the foraging rate and success of the cleaner fish.&lt;ref name=Cheney2012 /&gt; When mimics appear in higher densities relative to cleaners, there is a significant decline in the success rate of the cleaner fish. The effects of the mimic/model ratio are susceptible to dilution, whereby an increase in client fish allows both the mimics and the models to have more access to clients, thus limiting the negative effects that mimics have on model foraging success.&lt;ref name=Cheney2005 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, K.L. (2007) [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/274/1622/2087.full.pdf+html "Aggressive mimics profit from a model-signal receiver mutualism"] ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B'', '''274''': 1622: 2087-2091. {{doi|10.1098/rspb.2007.0543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9422">In [[biology]], a '''colony''' is composed of two or more [[conspecific]] individuals living in close association with, or connected to, one another. This association is usually for mutual benefit such as stronger defense or the ability to attack bigger prey.&lt;ref name=Jackson1977&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/283203|title= Competition on Marine Hard Substrata: The Adaptive Significance of Solitary and Colonial Strategies|year=1977|last1=Jackson|first1=J.B.C.|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=111|issue=980|pages=743–767}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a cluster of identical cells (clones) on the surface of (or within) a solid medium, usually derived from a single parent cell, as in bacterial colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Colony|title=Colony – Biology-Online Dictionary|website=www.biology-online.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a [[solitary animal|solitary organism]] is one in which all individuals live independently and have all of the functions needed to survive and reproduce.

Colonies, in the context of development, may be composed of two or more unitary (or solitary) organisms or be [[modular]] organisms. '''Unitary organisms''' have determinate development (set life stages) from [[zygote]] to adult form and individuals or groups of individuals (colonies) are visually distinct. '''Modular organisms''' have indeterminate growth forms (life stages not set) through repeated iteration of genetically identical modules (or individuals), and it can be difficult to distinguish between the colony as a whole and the modules within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | display-authors=1 | first1=Michael | last1=Begon | first2=Robert W. | last2=Howarth | first3=Colin R. | last3=Townsend | title=Essentials of Ecology | edition=4th | publisher=Wiley | year=2014 | isbn=0-470-90913-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, modules may have specific functions within the colony.

Some organisms are primarily independent and form [[facultative]] colonies in reply to environmental conditions while others must live in a colony to survive ([[obligate]]). For example, some [[carpenter bee]]s will form colonies when a dominant hierarchy is formed between two or more nest foundresses&lt;ref name=DunnRichards2003&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/beheco/14.3.417|title= When to bee social: interactions among environmental constraints, incentives, guarding, and relatedness in a facultatively social carpenter bee|year=2003|last1=Dunn|first1=T.|last2=Richards|first2=M.H.|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=14|issue=3|pages=417–424}}&lt;/ref&gt; (facultative colony), while [[coral]]s are animals that are physically connected by living tissue (the [[coenosarc]]) that contains a shared [[gastrovascular cavity]].

== Colony types ==

=== Social colonies ===
[[File:Colony Northern Gannet Morus bassanus.jpg|thumb|A breeding colony of [[Northern gannet]]s on the [[Heligoland]] archipelago in the [[North Sea]].]]

[[Unicellular]] and [[multicellular]] unitary organisms may aggregate to form colonies. For example,
* [[Protist]]s such as [[slime mold]]s are many unicellular organisms that aggregate to form colonies when food resources are hard to come by, as together they are more reactive to chemical cues released by preferred prey.
* [[Eusociality|Eusocial]] insects like [[ant]]s and [[honey bee]]s are multicellular animals that live in colonies with a highly organized social structure. Colonies of some social insects may be deemed [[superorganism]]s.
*  [[Animal]]s, such as humans and [[rodent]]s, form breeding or [[bird colony|nesting colonies]], potentially for more successful mating and to better protect offspring.
** The [[Bracken Cave]] is the summer home to a colony of around 20 million [[Mexican free-tailed bat]]s making it the largest known concentration of mammals.&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;{{cite journal | title = Quietly Conserving Nature | last = Grove | first = Noel | journal = [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] | date = December 1988 | volume = 174 | issue = 6 | page = 822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modular organisms ===
Modular organisms are those in which a genet (or genetic individual formed from a [[sexual reproduction|sexually-produced]] [[zygote]]) asexually reproduces to form genetically identical clones called [[ramet]]s.&lt;ref name=Winston2010&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/icb/icq146|title= Life in the Colonies: Learning the Alien Ways of Colonial Organisms|year=2010|last1=Winston|first1=J.|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|volume=50|issue=6|pages=919–933|pmid=21714171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''[[clonal colony]]''' is when the ramets of a genet live in close proximity or are physically connected. Ramets may have all of the functions needed to survive on their own or be interdependent on other ramets. For example, some [[sea anemone]]s go through the process of pedal laceration in which a genetically identical individual is asexually produced from tissue broken off from the anemone's pedal disc. In plants, clonal colonies are created through the propagation of genetically identical trees by [[stolon]]s or [[rhizome]]s.

'''Colonial organisms''' are [[clonal colonies]] composed of many physically connected, interdependent individuals. Colonial organisms can be unicellular, as in the alga ''[[Volvox]]'' (a [[Coenobium (morphology)|coenobium]]), or [[Multicellular organism|multicellular]], as in the [[phylum]] [[Bryozoa]]. The former type may have been the first step toward multicellular [[organism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | display-authors=1 | first1=Bruce | last1=Alberts | first2=Dennis | last2=Bray | first3=Julian | last3=Lewis | first4=Martin | last4=Raff | first5=Keith | last5=Roberts | first6=James D. | last6=Watson | title=Molecular Biology of the Cell | edition=3rd | location=New York | publisher=Garland Science | year=1994 | isbn=0-8153-1620-8 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK28332/ | accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals within a multicellular colonial organism may be called [[ramet]]s, [[Modularity (biology)|modules]], or [[zooid]]s. Structural and functional variation ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]), when present, designates ramet responsibilities such as feeding, reproduction, and defense. To that end, being physically connected allows the colonial organism to distribute nutrients and energy obtained by feeding zooids throughout the colony. An example of colonial organisms that is well known are hydrozoans, like Portuguese man o' wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Hydrozoa/|title=Hydrozoa|website=Animal Diversity Web|language=en|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Microbial colonies ===
A '''microbial colony'''  is defined as a visible cluster of [[microorganism]]s growing on the surface of or within a solid medium, presumably cultured from a single cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

  | publisher = [[Benjamin Cummings]]
  | year= 2009
  | pages = 170–171
  | isbn = 0-321-58420-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the colony is [[Clone (cell biology)|clonal]], with all organisms in it descending from a single ancestor (assuming no [[contamination]]), they are genetically identical, except for any [[mutation]]s (which occur at low frequencies). Obtaining such genetically identical organisms (or pure [[Strain (biology)|strains]]) can be useful; this is done by spreading organisms on a culture plate and starting a new stock from a single resulting colony.

A '''[[biofilm]]''' is a colony of [[microorganism]]s often comprising several species, with properties and capabilities greater than the aggregate of capabilities of the individual organisms.

== Life history ==

Individuals in social colonies and modular organisms receive benefit to such a lifestyle. For example, it may be easier to seek out food, defend a nesting site, or increase competitive ability against other species. Modular organisms' ability to reproduce asexually in addition to sexually allows them unique benefits that social colonies do not have.&lt;ref name="Winston2010" /&gt;

The energy required for sexual reproduction varies based on the frequency and length of reproductive activity, number and size of offspring, and parental care.&lt;ref name=KunzOrrell&gt;{{cite journal|title= Energy Costs of Reproduction|year=2004|last1=Kunz|first1=T.H.|last2=Orrell|first2=K.S.|journal=Encyclopedia of Energy|volume=5|pages=423–442}}&lt;/ref&gt; While solitary individuals bear all of those energy costs, individuals in some social colonies share a portion of those costs.

Modular organisms save energy by using asexual reproduction during their life. Energy reserved in this way allows them to put more energy towards colony growth, regenerating lost modules (due to predation or other cause of death), or response to environmental conditions.

When two objects always appear close to the [[ecliptic]]—such as two [[planet]]s, the [[Moon]] and a planet, or the [[Sun]] and a planet—this fact implies an apparent close approach between the objects as seen on the sky. A related word, ''[[appulse]]'', is the minimum apparent separation on the sky of two astronomical objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Conjunctions involve either two objects in the [[Solar System]] or one object in the Solar System and a more distant object, such as a [[star]]. A conjunction is an apparent phenomenon caused by the observer's [[perspective (visual)|perspective]]: the two objects involved are not actually close to one another in [[space]]. Conjunctions between two bright objects close to the ecliptic, such as two bright planets, can be seen with the [[naked eye]].

==Passing close==
[[File:Planetary Conjunction over Paranal.jpg|thumb|A conjunction of Mars and Jupiter in the morning of 1 May 2011, when, about an hour before sunrise, five of our Solar System's eight planets and the Moon could be seen from [[Cerro Paranal]], Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planetary Conjunction over Paranal|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1118a/|work=ESO Picture of the Week|publisher=ESO|accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

More generally, in the particular case of two [[planet]]s, it means that they merely have the same [[right ascension]] (and hence the same [[hour angle]]). This is called conjunction in right ascension. However, there is also the term conjunction in ecliptic longitude. At such conjunction both objects have the same ecliptic longitude. Conjunction in right ascension and conjunction in ecliptic longitude do not normally take place at the same time, but in most cases nearly at the same time. However, at [[triple conjunction]]s, it is possible that a conjunction only in right ascension (or ecliptic length) occurs. At the time of conjunction&amp;nbsp;– it does not matter if in right ascension or in ecliptic longitude&amp;nbsp;– the involved planets are close together upon the [[celestial sphere]]. In the vast majority of such cases, one of the planets will appear to pass north or south of the other.

==Passing closer==
[[File:ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) observatory at Paranal.jpg|thumb|In the night sky over [[ESO]]'s [[Very Large Telescope]] (VLT) observatory at [[Paranal Observatory|Paranal]], the [[Moon]] shines along with two bright companions: [[Venus]] and [[Jupiter]].]]
However, if two celestial bodies attain the same [[declination]] at the time of a conjunction in [[right ascension]] (or the same ecliptic latitude at a conjunction in ecliptic longitude), the one that is closer to the Earth will pass in front of the other. In such a case, a [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]] takes place. If one object moves into the shadow of another, the event is an [[eclipse]]. For example, if the Moon passes into the shadow of Earth and disappears from view, this event is called a [[lunar eclipse]]. If the visible disk of the nearer object is considerably smaller than that of the farther object, the event is called a [[Astronomical transit|transit]]. When Mercury passes in front of the Sun, it is a [[transit of Mercury]], and when Venus passes in front of the Sun, it is a [[transit of Venus]]. When the nearer object appears larger than the farther one, it will completely obscure its smaller companion; this is called an [[occultation]]. An example of an occultation is when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, causing the Sun to disappear either entirely or partially. This phenomenon is commonly known as a [[solar eclipse]]. Occultations in which the larger body is neither the Sun nor the Moon are very rare. More frequent, however, is an occultation of a planet by the [[Moon]]. Several such events are visible every year from various places on Earth.

==Position of the observer==
A conjunction, as a phenomenon of perspective, is an event that involves two astronomical bodies seen by an observer on the Earth. Times and details depend only very slightly on the observer's location on the Earth's surface, with the differences being greatest for conjunctions involving the Moon because of its relative closeness, but even for the Moon the time of a conjunction never differs by more than a few hours.

==Superior and inferior==
As seen from a planet that is [[inferior and superior planets|superior]], if an [[inferior and superior planets|inferior]] planet is on the opposite side of the Sun, it is in '''superior conjunction''' with the Sun. An '''inferior conjunction''' occurs when the two planets lie in a [[line (mathematics)|line]] on the same side of the [[Sun]]. In an inferior conjunction, the superior planet is "in [[astronomical opposition|opposition]]" to the Sun as seen from the inferior planet.
&lt;div style="float:left"&gt;[[File:Positional astronomy.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
The terms "inferior conjunction" and "superior conjunction" are used in particular for the planets [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], which are [[inferior and superior planets|inferior planets]] as seen from the Earth. However, this definition can be applied to any pair of planets, as seen from the one farther from the Sun.

A planet (or [[asteroid]] or [[comet]]) is simply said to be in conjunction, when it is in conjunction with the [[Sun]], as seen from the Earth. The [[Moon]] is in conjunction with the Sun at [[New moon|New Moon]].

==Quasiconjunction==
In a quasiconjunction, a planet in [[apparent retrograde motion|retrograde motion]]&amp;nbsp;— always either [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] or [[Venus]], from the point of view of [[the Earth]]&amp;nbsp;— will "drop back" in right ascension until it almost allows another planet to overtake it, but then the former planet will resume its forward motion and thereafter appear to draw away from it again. This will occur in the morning sky, before dawn. The reverse may happen in the evening sky after dusk, with Mercury or Venus entering retrograde motion just as it is about to overtake another planet (often Mercury ''and'' Venus are ''both'' of the planets involved, and when this situation arises they may remain in very close visual proximity for several days or even longer). The quasiconjunction is reckoned as occurring at the time the distance in right ascension between the two planets is smallest, even though, when declination is taken into account, they may appear closer together shortly before or after this.

==Notable conjunctions==

===1899===
In early December 1899 the Sun and the naked-eye planets appeared to lie within a band 35 degrees wide along the ecliptic as seen from the Earth. As a consequence, over the period 1–4 December 1899, the Moon reached conjunction with, in order, Jupiter, Uranus, the Sun, Mercury, Mars, Saturn and Venus. Most of these conjunctions were not visible because of the glare of the Sun.

===1962===
Over the period 4–6 February 1962, in a rare series of events, Mercury and Venus reached conjunction as observed from the Earth, followed by Venus and Jupiter, then by Mars and Saturn. Conjunctions took place between the Moon and, in turn, Mars, Saturn, the Sun, Mercury, Venus and Jupiter. Mercury also reached inferior conjunction with the Sun. The conjunction between the Moon and the Sun at [[new Moon]] produced a total solar eclipse visible in Indonesia and the Pacific Ocean,&lt;ref&gt;

when these five naked-eye planets were visible in the vicinity of the Sun in the sky.

===1987===
[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]] and [[Mars]] separately reached conjunction with each other, and each separately with the Sun, within a 7-day period in August 1987 as seen from the Earth. The Moon also reached conjunction with each of these bodies on 24 August. However, none of these conjunctions were observable due to the glare of the Sun.&lt;ref name="meeus_astrontables1983" /&gt;

===2000===
In May 2000, in a very rare event, several planets lay in the vicinity of the Sun in the sky as seen from the Earth, and a series of conjunctions took place. Jupiter, Mercury and Saturn each reached conjunction with the Sun in the period 8–10 May. These three planets in turn were in conjunction with each other and with Venus over a period of a few weeks. However, most of these conjunctions were not visible from the Earth because of the glare from the Sun.&lt;ref name="meeus_astrontables1983" /&gt; NASA referred to May 5 as the date of the conjunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Planetary Alignment of 5 May 2000|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/alignment.html|publisher=National Space Science Data Center - NASA|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2002===
Venus, Mars and Saturn appeared close together in the evening sky in early May 2002, with a conjunction of Mars and Saturn occurring on 4 May. This was followed by a conjunction of Venus and Saturn on 7 May, and another of Venus and Mars on 10 May when their angular separation was only 18 arcminutes. A series of conjunctions between the Moon and, in order, Saturn, Mars and Venus took place on 14 May, although it was not possible to observe all these in darkness from any single location on the Earth.&lt;ref name="meeus_astrontables1983" &gt;

'''Copper loss''' is the term often given to [[heat]] produced by [[electrical current]]s in the [[Electrical conductor|conductor]]s of [[transformer]] windings, or other electrical devices. Copper losses are an undesirable transfer of [[energy]], as are [[core loss]]es, which result from [[induced current]]s in adjacent components. The term is applied regardless of whether the windings are made of [[copper]] or another conductor, such as [[aluminium]]. Hence the term '''winding loss''' is often preferred.  The term [[load loss]] is closely related but not identical, since an unloaded transformer will have some winding loss.

==Calculations==
Copper losses result from [[Joule heating]] and so are also referred to as "I squared R losses", in reference to [[Joule's first law|Joule's First Law]]. This states that the energy lost each [[second]], or [[Power (physics)|power]], increases as the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the current through the windings and in [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]] to the [[electrical resistance]] of the conductors.

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Copper Loss} \propto I^2 \cdot R&lt;/math&gt;

where I is the current flowing in the conductor and R the resistance of the conductor. With I in [[ampere]]s and R in ohms, the calculated power loss is given in [[watt]]s.

Joule heating has a [[coefficient of performance]] of 1.0, meaning that every 1 watt of electrical power is converted to 1 Joule of heat. Therefore, the energy lost due to copper loss is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Copper Loss} = I^2 \cdot R \cdot t&lt;/math&gt;

where t is the time in [[second]]s the current is maintained. 

==Effect of frequency==
For low-frequency applications, the power lost can be minimized by employing conductors with a large cross-sectional area, made from low-[[resistivity]] metals.

With high-frequency currents, the [[Proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]] and [[skin effect]] cause the current to be unevenly distributed across the conductor, increasing its effective resistance, and making loss calculations more difficult.

[[Litz wire]] is a type of wire constructed to force the current to be distributed uniformly, thereby reducing Joule heating.

==Reducing copper loss==
Among other measures, the electrical energy efficiency of a typical industrial [[induction motor]] can be improved by reducing the electrical losses in the [[stator]] windings (e.g., by increasing the cross-sectional area of the conductor, improving the winding technique, and using materials with higher electrical conductivities, such as copper).

==History==

Cracking Art movement was born in 1993 in [[Biella]]. It was founded by Omar Ronda, Alex Angi, Renzo Nucara, Carlo Rizzetti, Marco Veronese and Vittorio Valente who left the group almost immediately replaced by Kicco. In 2001 Alessandro Pianca has been part of the group for one year. In 2003 William Sweetlove joined the movement. In 2008, Omar Ronda, the founder, abandoned the project in order to follow his personal career.

Cracking Art movement is currently formed by five artists: Alex Angi, Renzo Nucara, Marco Veronese, William Sweetlove and Kicco. The common aim is to change the history of art through a strong social and environmental commitment that, combined with an innovative use of plastic materials, evokes the close relationship between natural and artificial reality.

==Philosophy==

The name "Cracking Art" comes from the verb "to crack" which indicates the state of being split, broken, crashed. Moreover, the catalytic cracking is the name that stands for the chemical reaction occurring when the raw [[crude oil]] is converted into [[plastic]]. This is the reason why for the movement "cracking" represents the moment when something natural becomes artificial, the most important instant that for the artists of the movement should be represented through art.

# Cracking is the process that transforms [[petroleum]] into virgin [[naphtha]], a material used for creating many products of synthesis as plastic.
# Cracking is the gap of the contemporary man who struggles between his primary naturalness and a future that becomes more and more artificial.
# Plastic finds its roots in a millenary tradition of civilization, in a huge and deep cultural evolution that link together the human being, the artificial creations and the environmental nature. In a certain sense Cracking could be considered as a conceptual formula used to challenge the rules of contemporary art.
# Cracking is the process that transforms natural into artificial, organic into synthetic. It is the process that puts us all in front of new realities.&lt;ref&gt;Luca Beatrice, Tommaso Trini, ''Cracking Art'', Adriano Parise, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

===The concept of Regeneration===

The concept of Regeneration enlivens the artistic history of the movement since its origins. The plastic, chosen material of the movement, has the eternal property of being crushed and reshaped into other sculptures. The artworks are designed to inspire sensibility in recycling plastic for the environment while leaving a significant artistic value to the world we live in. [[Recycling]] plastic means to subtract toxic destruction which devastates nature, as well as creating plastic artworks means to communicate through an universal language while paying strong attention to the planet.&lt;ref&gt;Damian Sausset in ''Treviso 2010 - Cracking Art - Regeneration'', Consorzio Per Mio Figlio, Treviso 2010, pp. 47-52&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim is to connect common reasoning to individual meditation, creating installations with animals that appear unexpectedly in everyday places. The astonishment of meeting an ordinary subject transformed into something extraordinary through its super size, color and shape catches people attention and invites them to see urban life and cities in a different way.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Alton in ''Treviso 2010 - Cracking Art - Regeneration'', Consorzio Per Mio Figlio, Treviso 2010, pp. 53-55&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Environmental Change Institute''' was founded in 1987 in [[Oxford University]] in [[England]] "''to organize and promote interdisciplinary research on the nature, causes and impact of environmental change and to contribute to the development of management strategies for coping with future environmental change''." This statement still embodies the ECI’s ethos of purposeful environmental research and knowledge exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Environmental Change Institute|url=http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With an annual research income of £4.7million in 2013/14, a portfolio of 50 active projects, 350 partners and 60 researchers working across 40 countries, the ECI is an active and influential player in environmental change science.

The ECI’s research is interdisciplinary, both in outlook and approach. ECI has a well- established track record in relation to climate, energy and ecosystems and a growing expertise in relation to food and water.

ECI is a leading player in number of large research activities, including: the [http://www.ukcip.org.uk UK Climate Impacts Programme] (UKCIP) which develops new tools to link climate science with stakeholders in business and government in order to create innovative adaptations to the impacts of climate change; [http://www.climateprediction.net Climateprediction.net] the world’s largest citizen science climate ensemble with 350,000 individuals running climate simulations in order to better understand regional climate patterns; leaders of major EU consortium programmes including one on the impacts and risks of extreme climate change ([http://www.impressions-project.eu/ Impressions]); and coordinators of [http://gem.tropicalforests.ox.ac.uk/ GEM], a global ecological monitoring programme across remote forest locations in South America, Africa and Asia.

The ECI’s full portfolio of projects has led to academic papers and citations totaling over 45,000 since 2000.

The ECI is also home to the [http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/teaching/msc/ MSc in Environmental Change and Management] (ECM), the School’s first taught postgraduate masters’ programme, and Oxford's most popular graduate science course.

The Institute is led by [http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/people/halljim.php Professor Jim Hall].

==History==
[[Image:Ojibweherbalistmedicine.png|thumb|Plants have been widely used by [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] healers, such as this [[Ojibwa]] man.]]
The idea of ethnobotany was first proposed by the early 20th century botanist [[John William Harshberger]].&lt;ref name=auto&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=James T.|title=The National cyclopædia of American biography ... v.21.|date=1931|publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Harshberger did perform ethnobotanical research extensively, including in areas such as North Africa, Mexico, Scandinavia, and Pennsylvania,&lt;ref name=auto/&gt; it was not until [[Richard Evans Schultes]] began his trips into the Amazon that ethnobotany become a more well known science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ponman, Bussmann|first1=Bruce E, Rainer W.|title=Medicinal Plants and the Legacy of Richard E. Schultes|year=2012|publisher=Missouri Botanical Garden|isbn=0984841520|url=http://www.nybg.org/files/scientists/mbalick/Balick_preprint.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the practice of ethnobotany is thought to have much earlier origins in the first century AD when a Greek physician by the name of [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] wrote an extensive botanical text detailing the medical and culinary properties of "over 600 mediterranean plants" named [[De Materia Medica]].&lt;ref name=eplantscience/&gt; Historians note that Dioscorides wrote about traveling often throughout the Roman empire, including regions such as "Greece, Crete, Egypt, and Petra",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mazal, Otto|title=Dioscorides: De Materia Medica|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/aconite/materiamedica.html|website=Uchicago.edu|publisher=[[University of Chicago]]|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in doing so obtained substantial knowledge about the local plants and their useful properties. European botanical knowledge drastically expanded once the New World was discovered due to ethnobotany. This expansion in knowledge can be primarily attributed to the substantial influx of new plants from the Americas, including crops such as potatoes, peanuts, avocados, and tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/nattrans/ntecoindian/essays/columbianb.htm|title=The Columbian Exchange, Native Americans and the Land, Nature Transformed, TeacherServe, National Humanities Center|website=nationalhumanitiescenter.org|publisher=[[National Humanities Center]]|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One French explorer in the 16th century, [[Jacques Cartier]],  learned a cure for scurvy (a tea made from boiling the bark of the Sitka Spruce) from a local [[Iroquois]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/library/documents/treebook/sitkaspruce.htm|title=Sitka spruce|website=www.for.gov.bc.ca|place=[[British Columbia]]|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval and Renaissance==
During the medieval period, ethnobotanical studies were commonly found connected with [[Christian monasticism#Contributions|monasticism]]. Notable at this time was [[Hildegard of Bingen|Hildegard von Bingen]]. However, most botanical knowledge was kept in gardens such as [[physic garden]]s attached to hospitals and religious buildings. It was thought of in practical use terms for culinary and medical purposes and the ethnographic element was not studied as a modern [[anthropologist]] might approach ethnobotany today.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Age of Reason==
Carl Linnaeus carried out in 1732 a [[Expedition to Lapland|research expedition]] in Scandinavia asking the [[Sami people]] about their [[Ethnology|ethnological]] usage of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Before Boas: The Genesis of Ethnography and Ethnology in the German Enlightenment Critical Studies in the History of Anthropology Series|author=Han F. Vermeulen|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|year=2015|isbn=9780803277380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[age of enlightenment]] saw a rise in economic [[botanical]] exploration. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] collected data from the New World, and [[James Cook]]'s voyages brought back collections and information on plants from the South Pacific. At this time major botanical gardens were started, for instance the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] in 1759. The directors of the gardens sent out [[List of gardener-botanist explorers of the Enlightenment|gardener-botanist explorers]] to care for and collect plants to add to their collections.

As the 18th century became the 19th, ethnobotany saw expeditions undertaken with more colonial aims rather than trade economics such as that of [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clarke]] which recorded both plants and the peoples encountered use of them. [[Edward Palmer (botanist)|Edward Palmer]] collected [[material culture]] artifacts and botanical specimens from people in the North American West ([[Great Basin]]) and Mexico from the 1860s to the 1890s. Through all of this research, the field of "aboriginal botany" was established—the study of all forms of the vegetable world which [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal peoples]] use for food, medicine, [[textile]]s, ornaments and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Economic Botany: Principles and Practices|author=G.E. Wickens|edition=illustrated|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2012|isbn=9789401009690|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and application in modern science==
The first individual to study the [[emic]] perspective of the plant world was a German physician working in Sarajevo at the end of the 19th century: Leopold Glück. His published work on traditional medical uses of plants done by rural people in Bosnia (1896) has to be considered the first modern ethnobotanical work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethnobotany and Biocultural Diversities in the Balkans: Perspectives on Sustainable Rural Development and Reconciliation|editor=Andrea Pieroni, Cassandra L. Quave|edition=illustrated|publisher=Springer|year=2014|isbn=9781493914920|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Other scholars analyzed uses of plants under an indigenous/local perspective in the 20th century: [[Matilda Coxe Stevenson]], Zuni plants (1915); [[Frank Hamilton Cushing|Frank Cushing]], Zuni foods (1920); [[Keewaydinoquay Peschel]], Anishinaabe fungi (1998), and the team approach of Wilfred Robbins, [[John Peabody Harrington]], and [[Barbara Freire-Marreco]], Tewa pueblo plants (1916).

In the beginning, ethonobotanical specimens and studies were not very reliable and sometimes not helpful. This is because the botanists and the anthropologists did not always collaborate in their work. The botanists focused on identifying species and how the plants were used instead of concentrating upon how plants fit into people's lives. On the other hand, anthropologists were interested in the cultural role of plants and treated other scientific aspects superficially. In the early 20th century, botanists and anthropologists better collaborated and the collection of reliable, detailed cross-disciplinary data began.

Beginning in the 20th century, the field of ethnobotany experienced a shift from the raw compilation of data to a greater methodological and conceptual reorientation. This is also the beginning of academic ethnobotany. The so-called "father" of this discipline is [[Richard Evans Schultes]], even though he did not actually coin the term "ethnobotany". Today the field of ethnobotany requires a variety of skills: botanical training for the identification and preservation of plant specimens; anthropological training to understand the cultural concepts around the perception of plants; linguistic training, at least enough to transcribe local terms and understand native morphology, syntax, and semantics.

[[Mark Plotkin]], who studied at [[Harvard University]], the [[Yale School of Forestry]] and [[Tufts University]], has contributed a number of books on ethnobotany. He completed a handbook for the [[Tirio people]] of [[Suriname]] detailing their medicinal plants; ''Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice'' (1994); ''The Shaman's Apprentice,'' a children's book with Lynne Cherry (1998); and  ''Medicine Quest: In Search of Nature's Healing Secrets'' (2000).

Plotkin was interviewed in 1998 by ''[[South American Explorers|South American Explorer]]'' magazine, just after the release of ''Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice'' and the [[IMAX]] movie Amazonia. In the book, he stated that he saw wisdom in both traditional and Western forms of medicine:
&lt;blockquote&gt;No medical system has all the answers—no shaman that I've worked with has the equivalent of a polio vaccine and no dermatologist that I've been to could cure a fungal infection as effectively (and inexpensively) as some of my Amazonian mentors. It shouldn't be the doctor versus the witch doctor. It should be the best aspects of all medical systems ([[Ayurveda|ayurvedic]], [[herbalism]], [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]], and so on) combined in a way which makes health care more effective and more affordable for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Shaman's Apprentice|accessdate=May 2, 2018}} ''South American Explorer'', Autumn 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A great deal of information about the traditional uses of plants is still intact with tribal peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Sood, S.K., Nath, R. and Kalia, D.C. 2001. ''Ethnobotany of Cold Desert Tribes of Lahoul-Spiti'' (''N.W. Himalaya''). Deep Publications, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; But the native healers are often reluctant to accurately share their knowledge to outsiders. Schultes actually apprenticed himself to an Amazonian shaman, which involves a long-term commitment and genuine relationship. In ''Wind in the Blood: Mayan Healing &amp; Chinese Medicine'' by Garcia et al. the visiting acupuncturists were able to access levels of Mayan medicine that anthropologists could not because they had something to share in exchange. Cherokee medicine priest [[David Winston]] describes how his uncle would invent nonsense to satisfy visiting anthropologists.&lt;ref&gt;''Wind in the Blood: Mayan Healing and Chinese Medicine'', by Hernan Garcia, Antonio Sierra, Hilberto Balam, and Jeff Connant&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scholar, James W. Herrick, who studied under ethnologist [[William N. Fenton]], in his work ''Iroquois Medical Ethnobotany'' (1995) with Dean R. Snow (editor), professor of Anthropology at Penn State, explains that understanding herbal medicines in traditional Iroquois cultures is rooted in a strong and ancient [[cosmological]] belief system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=American Indian Culture and Research Journal|volume=20|issue=2|publisher=American Indian Culture and Research Center, University of California|year=1996|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work provides perceptions and conceptions of illness and imbalances which can manifest in physical forms from benign maladies to serious diseases. It also includes a large compilation of Herrick’s field work from numerous Iroquois authorities of over 450 names, uses, and preparations of plants for various ailments. Traditional Iroquois practitioners had (and have) a sophisticated perspective on the plant world that contrast strikingly with that of modern medical science.&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, J. W. (1995). ''Iroquois Medical Botany''. Syracuse, NY: [[Syracuse University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher Cassandra Quave at Emory University has used ethnobotany to address the problems that arise from antibiotic resistance. Quave notes that the advantage of medical ethnobotany over Western medicine rests in the difference in mechanism. For example, elmleaf blackberry extract focuses instead on the prevention of bacterial collaboration as opposed to directly exterminating them. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/magazine/could-ancient-remedies-hold-the-answer-to-the-looming-antibiotics-crisis.html|title=Could Ancient Remedies Hold the Answer to the Looming Antibiotics Crisis?|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
{{clarify section|reason=it should explain what kind of gender biases exist, and how they came to be|date=September 2017}}
Many instances of [[gender bias]] have occurred in ethnobotany, creating the risk of drawing erroneous conclusions. Anthropologists would often consult with primarily men. In Las Pavas, a small farming community in Panama, anthropologists drew conclusions about the entire community's use of plant from their conversations and lessons with mostly men. They consulted with 40 families, but the women only participated rarely in interviews and never joined them in the field. Due to the division of labor, the knowledge of wild plants for food, medicine, and fibers, among others, was left out of the picture, resulting in a distorted view of which plants were actually important to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/163864/Gender_Bias_in_Ethnobotany_Propositions_and_Evidence_of_a_Distorted_Science_and_Promises_of_a_Brighter_Future|title=Gender Bias in Ethnobotany: Propositions and Evidence of a Distorted Science and Promises of a Brighter Future.|author=Howard, Patricia|website=academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K0s__h3ipY|title=Gender bias in ethnobotany -- a legacy and process|publisher=TeachEthnobotany|date=2 July 2013|via=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ethnobotanists have also assumed that ownership of a resource means familiarity with that resource. In some societies women are excluded from owning land, while being the ones who work it. Inaccurate data can come from interviewing only the owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jeanine M. Pfeiffer|author2=Ramona J. Butz|year=2005|title=Assessing Cultural And Ecological Variation In Ethnobiological Research: The Importance Of Gender|url=http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&amp;context=envs_pub|journal=Journal of Ethnobiology|publisher=[[San Jose State University]]|volume=25|issue=2|pages=240–278|doi=10.2993/0278-0771(2005)25[240:ACAEVI]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other issues include ethical concerns regarding interactions with [[indigenous populations]], and the International Society of Ethnobiology has created a code of ethics to guide researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnobiology.net/what-we-do/core-programs/ise-ethics-program/code-of-ethics/|title=The ISE Code of Ethics - International Society of Ethnobiology|website=ethnobiology.net|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quintilian Development==
The art of facilitas was most notably taught by [[Quintilian]], the Roman rhetorician, in the latter part of the first century A.D. (c. 35 – c. 100).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pearltrees.com/#/N-f=1_6721279&amp;N-fa=5997373&amp;N-p=62584516&amp;N-play=0&amp;N-s=1_6721279&amp;N-u=1_789406&lt;/ref&gt; In Quintilian's [[Institutio Oratoria]], Quintilian summarizes the Roman educational system. In this system, students, generally young boys, were trained daily from the age of six to about eighteen. There were two levels of masters who taught the children: the grammaticus, who helped children with imitations, speaking and writing exercises, and the rhetor, who prepared students for the final stage of declamation, when they gave fictitious speeches.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, J.J. (1996). Quintilian. In T. Enos (Ed.), Encyclopedia of rhetoric and composition: Communication from ancient times to the information age (581–585). New York: Garland.&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal of Quintilian’s curriculum was for men to have facilitas: the ability to speak extemporaneously on any subject at any time.&lt;ref&gt;Bourelle, Andrew.

[[File:Epigallocatechin.png|thumb|right|200px|Epigallocatechin (EGC)]]
'''Flavan-3-ols''' (sometimes referred to as '''flavanols''') are derivatives of [[flavan]]s that use the 2-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2''H''-chromen-3-ol skeleton.  These compounds include [[catechin]], [[epicatechin gallate]], [[epigallocatechin]], [[epigallocatechin gallate]], [[proanthocyanidin]]s, [[theaflavin]]s, [[thearubigin]]s.

Flav'''a'''nols (with an "a") are not to be confused with [[flavonol]]s (with an "o"), a class of [[flavonoid]]s containing a [[ketone]] group.

The single-molecule (monomer) catechin, or isomer epicatechin (see diagram), adds four hydroxyls to flavan-3-ol, making building blocks for concatenated polymers ([[proanthocyanidin]]s) and higher order polymers ([[anthocyanidin]]s).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;OPC in Practice, 1995 3rd Edition, by Bert Schwitters in collaboration with Prof. Jack Masquelier.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flavanols possess two chiral carbons, meaning four [[diastereoisomer]]s occur for each of them.

Catechins are distinguished from the yellow, ketone-containing flavonoids such as [[quercitin]] and [[rutin]], which are called [[flavonol|flav'''o'''nols]]. Early use of the term '''bioflavonoid''' was imprecisely applied to include the flavanols, which are distinguished by absence of ketone(s).  Catechin monomers, dimers, and trimers (oligomers) are colorless.  Higher order polymers, anthocyanidins, exhibit deepening reds and become [[tannin]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Sources of catechins==
{{Main|Polyphenols in tea|Polyphenols in wine}}{{See also|Cocoa bean#Health_benefits}}
The catechins are abundant in [[tea]]s derived from the tea plant ''[[Camellia sinensis]]'', as well as in some [[Cocoa solids|cocoas]] and [[chocolate]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hammerstone JF, Lazarus SA, Schmitz HH |title=Procyanidin content and variation in some commonly consumed foods |journal=J.

Catechins are also present in the human diet in fruits, vegetables and [[wine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ruidavets J, Teissedre P, Ferrières J, Carando S, Bougard G, Cabanis J |title=Catechin in the Mediterranean diet: vegetable, fruit or wine? |journal=Atherosclerosis |volume=153 |issue=1 |pages=107–17 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11058705 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0021915000003774 |doi=10.1016/S0021-9150(00)00377-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are found in many other plant species.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News | Health | Chocolate 'has health benefits'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mabry, Helga |author2=Harborne, J. B. |author3=Mabry, T. J. |title=The Flavonoids |publisher=Chapman and Hall |location=London |year=1975 |isbn=978-0-412-11960-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catechin and the gallates ==

[[Catechin]] and [[epicatechin]] are [[epimer]]s, with (-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin being the most common optical [[isomer]]s found in nature. Catechin was first isolated from the plant extract [[catechu]], from which it derives its name. Heating catechin past its point of decomposition releases [[pyrocatechol]] (also called catechol), which explains the common origin of the names of these compounds.

[[Epigallocatechin]] and [[gallocatechin]] contain an additional phenolic [[hydroxyl group]] when compared to epicatechin and catechin, respectively, similar to the difference in [[pyrogallol]] compared to pyrocatechol.

Catechin gallates are [[gallic acid]] [[ester]]s of the catechins; an example is [[epigallocatechin gallate]], which is commonly the most abundant catechin in tea.

== Metabolism of flavan-3-ols ==

=== Biosynthesis of (-)-epicatechin ===

The flavonoids are products from a cinnamoyl-CoA starter unit, with chain extension using three molecules of malonyl-CoA. Reactions are catalyzed by a type III PKS enzyme. These enzyme do not use ACPSs, but instead employ coenzyme A esters and have a single active site to perform the necessary series of reactions, e.g. chain extension, condensation, and cyclization. Chain extension of 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA with three molecules of malonyl-CoA gives initially a polyketide (Figure 1), which can be folded. These allow Claisen-like reactions to occur, generating aromatic rings.&lt;ref name="Dewick2009p168" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winkel-Shirley2001p485-493" /&gt;

==Potential health effects of catechins==
{{Main|Tea and health|Wine and health|Cocoa bean#Health_benefits}}
The supposed health benefits of catechins have been studied extensively in humans and animal models, but there are no proven effects that apply to human health.

==Biotic interactions==

=== Perception by flower visitors ===
Flower visitors such as insects and bats detect floral scent thanks to [[chemoreceptor]]s of variable specificity to a specific VOC. The fixation of a VOC on a chemoreceptor triggers the activation of an antennal glomerulus, further projecting on an olfactory receptor neuron and finally triggering a behavioral response after processing of the information (see also  [[Olfaction]], [[Insect olfaction]]). The simultaneous perception of various VOCs may cause the activation of several glomeruli, but the output signal may not be additive due to synergistic or antagonistic mechanisms linked with inter-neuronal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cunningham|first=J. P.|date=2012-02-01|title=Can mechanism help explain insect host choice?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2011.02435.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology|language=en|volume=25|issue=2|pages=244–251|doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2011.02435.x|issn=1420-9101|pmid=22225990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the perception of a VOC within a floral blend may trigger a different behavioral response than when perceived isolated. Similarly, the output signal is not proportional to the amount of VOCs, with some VOCs in low amount in the floral blend having major effects on pollinator behavior. A good characterization of floral scent, both qualitative and quantitative, is necessary to understand and potentially predict flower visitors' behaviour.

Flower visitors use floral scent to detect, recognize and locate their host species, and even to discriminate among flowers of the same plant.&lt;ref name="Dudareva_etal_2006" /&gt; This is made possible by the high specificity of floral scent, where both the diversity of VOCs and their relative amount may characterize the flowering species, an individual plant, a flower of the individual plant, and the distance of the plume from the source.

To make the best use of this specific information, flower visitors rely on long-term and short-term memory that allow them to efficiently choose their flower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chittka|first=Lars|last2=Thomson|first2=James D.|last3=Waser|first3=Nickolas M.|title=Flower Constancy, Insect Psychology, and Plant Evolution|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001140050636|journal=Naturwissenschaften|language=en|volume=86|issue=8|pages=361–377|doi=10.1007/s001140050636|issn=0028-1042}}&lt;/ref&gt; They learn to associate the floral scent of a plant to a reward such as [[nectar]] and [[pollen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giurfa|first=Martin|date=2007-07-17|title=Behavioral and neural analysis of associative learning in the honeybee: a taste from the magic well|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00359-007-0235-9|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|language=en|volume=193|issue=8|pages=801–824|doi=10.1007/s00359-007-0235-9|issn=0340-7594}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have different behavioral responses to known scents versus unknown ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Junker|first=Robert R.|last2=Höcherl|first2=Nicole|last3=Blüthgen|first3=Nico|date=2010-07-01|title=Responses to olfactory signals reflect network structure of flower-visitor interactions|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01698.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|language=en|volume=79|issue=4|pages=818–823|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01698.x|issn=1365-2656}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also able to react similarly to slightly different odor blends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerrieri|first=Fernando|last2=Schubert|first2=Marco|last3=Sandoz|first3=Jean-Christophe|last4=Giurfa|first4=Martin|date=2005-02-22|title=Perceptual and Neural Olfactory Similarity in Honeybees|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030060|journal=PLOS Biol|volume=3|issue=4|pages=e60|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030060|issn=1545-7885|pmc=1043859|pmid=15736975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mediated biotic interactions===
[[File:Pollinator Amajus.jpg|thumb|300px|Pollinators use both floral scent and floral colour to locate flowers of ''Antirrhinum majus spp. striatum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaworski|first1=Coline C.|last2=Andalo|first2=Christophe|last3=Raynaud|first3=Christine|last4=Simon|first4=Valérie|last5=Thébaud|first5=Christophe|last6=Chave|first6=Jérôme|last7=Huang|first7=Shuang-Quan|title=The Influence of Prior Learning Experience on Pollinator Choice: An Experiment Using Bumblebees on Two Wild Floral Types of Antirrhinum majus|journal=PLOS ONE|date=11 August 2015|volume=10|issue=8|pages=e0130225|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0130225|pmid=26263186|pmc=4532467}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]A major function of floral scent is to attract [[pollinator]]s, and hence to ensure reproduction of animal-pollinated plants.

Some families of VOCs presented in floral scent have likely evolved as herbivore repellents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schiestl|first=Florian P.|date=2010-05-01|title=The evolution of floral scent and insect chemical communication|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01451.x/abstract|journal=Ecology Letters|language=en|volume=13|issue=5|pages=643–656|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01451.x|issn=1461-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these [[Plant defense against herbivory|plant defenses]] are also used by herbivores themselves to locate a plant resource, similarly to pollinators attracted by floral scent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Theis|first=Nina|last2=Adler|first2=Lynn S.|date=2012-02-01|title=Advertising to the enemy: enhanced floral fragrance increases beetle attraction and reduces plant reproduction|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/11-0825.1/abstract|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=93|issue=2|pages=430–435|doi=10.1890/11-0825.1|issn=1939-9170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this [[phenotypic trait]] is subject to antagonistic [[selection pressures]] (positive selection by pollinators and negative selection by herbivores), leading to contrasting [[Evolution|evolutionary patterns]].

=== Plant-plant communications ===
Floral scents are the only types of volatile cues that can be used to inform other plants about the mating environment. Plants that sense floral scents emitted by other plants can adapt their floral phenotypic traits that affect pollination and mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caruso|first=Christina M.|last2=Parachnowitsch|first2=Amy L.|title=Do Plants Eavesdrop on Floral Scent Signals?|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2015.09.001|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=21|issue=1|pages=9–15|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2015.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in sexually deceptive orchids, floral scents emitted after pollination reduce attractiveness of the flower to pollinators, which acts as a signal to pollinators to visit unpollinated flowers within an inflorescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schiestl|first=Florian P.|last2=Ayasse|first2=Manfred|date=2001-02-01|title=Post-pollination emission of a repellent compound in a sexually deceptive orchid: a new mechanism for maximising reproductive success?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004420000552|journal=Oecologia|language=en|volume=126|issue=4|pages=531–534|doi=10.1007/s004420000552|issn=0029-8549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis of floral VOCs==
Most floral VOCs belong to three main chemical classes.&lt;ref name="Piechulla&amp;Effmert_2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dudareva_etal_2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dudareva|first1=Natalia|last2=Negre|first2=Florence|last3=Nagegowda|first3=Dinesh A.|last4=Orlova|first4=Irina|title=Plant Volatiles: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives|journal=Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences|date=October 2006|volume=25|issue=5|pages=417–440|doi=10.1080/07352680600899973}}&lt;/ref&gt; VOCs in the same chemical class are synthesized from a shared precursor, but the biochemical pathway is specific for each VOC and often varies from a plant species to the other.

[[Terpenoid]]s (or isoprenoids) are derived from [[isoprene]] and synthesized via the [[mevalonate pathway]] or the erythrol phosphate pathway. They represent the majority of floral VOCs, and are often the most abundant compounds in floral scent blends.&lt;ref name="Gershenzon&amp;Dudareva_2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gershenzon|first1=Jonathan|last2=Dudareva|first2=Natalia|title=The function of terpene natural products in the natural world|journal=Nature Chemical Biology|date=18 June 2007|volume=3|issue=7|pages=408–414|doi=10.1038/nchembio.2007.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second chemical class is composed of the fatty acid derivatives, synthesized from [[acetyl-CoA]], of which most of them are also known as [[green leaf volatiles]], because there are also emitted by vegetative parts (ie leaves and stems) of plants, and in sometimes higher abundance than from floral tissue.

The third chemical class is composed of benzenoids/[[phenylpropanoid]]s, also known as [[Aromaticity|aromatic compounds]], they are synthesized from [[phenylalanine]].

==Regulation of emissions==
Floral scent emissions of most flowering plants vary predictably throughout the day, following a [[circadian rhythm]]. This variation is controlled by light intensity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harmer|first=Stacey L.|last2=Hogenesch|first2=John B.|last3=Straume|first3=Marty|last4=Chang|first4=Hur-Song|last5=Han|first5=Bin|last6=Zhu|first6=Tong|last7=Wang|first7=Xun|last8=Kreps|first8=Joel A.|last9=Kay|first9=Steve A.|date=2000-12-15|title=Orchestrated Transcription of Key Pathways in Arabidopsis by the Circadian Clock|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/290/5499/2110|journal=Science|language=en|volume=290|issue=5499|pages=2110–2113|doi=10.1126/science.290.5499.2110|issn=0036-8075|pmid=11118138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maximal emissions coincide with peaks of highest activity of visiting pollinators. For instance, [[Antirrhinum|snapdragon]] flowers, mostly pollinated by bees, have highest emissions at noon, whereas nocturnally-visited [[Nicotiana|tobacco plants]] have highest emissions at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolosova|first=Natalia|last2=Gorenstein|first2=Nina|last3=Kish|first3=Christine M.|last4=Dudareva|first4=Natalia|date=2001-10-01|title=Regulation of Circadian Methyl Benzoate Emission in Diurnally and Nocturnally Emitting Plants|url=http://www.plantcell.org/content/13/10/2333|journal=The Plant Cell|language=en|volume=13|issue=10|pages=2333–2347|doi=10.1105/tpc.010162|issn=1532-298X|pmc=139162|pmid=11595805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Floral scent emissions also vary along floral development, with highest emissions at anthesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dudareva|first=Natalia|last2=Murfitt|first2=Lisa M.|last3=Mann|first3=Craig J.|last4=Gorenstein|first4=Nina|last5=Kolosova|first5=Natalia|last6=Kish|first6=Christine M.|last7=Bonham|first7=Connie|last8=Wood|first8=Karl|date=2000-06-01|title=Developmental Regulation of Methyl Benzoate Biosynthesis and Emission in Snapdragon Flowers|url=http://www.plantcell.org/content/12/6/949|journal=The Plant Cell|language=en|volume=12|issue=6|pages=949–961|doi=10.1105/tpc.12.6.949|issn=1532-298X|pmid=10852939|pmc=149095}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. when the flower is fecund, and reduced emissions after pollination, probably due to mechanisms linked with fecundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Negre|first=Florence|last2=Kish|first2=Christine M.|last3=Boatright|first3=Jennifer|last4=Underwood|first4=Beverly|last5=Shibuya|first5=Kenichi|last6=Wagner|first6=Conrad|last7=Clark|first7=David G.|last8=Dudareva|first8=Natalia|date=2003-12-01|title=Regulation of Methylbenzoate Emission after Pollination in Snapdragon and Petunia Flowers|url=http://www.plantcell.org/content/15/12/2992|journal=The Plant Cell|language=en|volume=15|issue=12|pages=2992–3006|doi=10.1105/tpc.016766|issn=1532-298X|pmc=282847|pmid=14630969}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tropical orchids, floral scent emission is terminated immediately following pollination, primarily to reduce expenditure of energy on fragrance production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0065-2296(08)60091-9|title=Aspects of the Physiology of Orchids|last=Arditti|first=Joseph|pages=421–655|doi=10.1016/s0065-2296(08)60091-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In petunia flowers, ethylene is released to stop synthesis of benzenoid floral volatiles after successful pollination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schuurink|first=Robert C.|last2=Haring|first2=Michel A.|last3=Clark|first3=David G.|date=|title=Regulation of volatile benzenoid biosynthesis in petunia flowers|journal=Trends in Plant Science|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=20–25|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2005.09.009|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abiotic factors, such as temperature, atmospheric CO2 concentration, hydric stress and soil nutrient status also impact the regulation of floral scent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-04670-4_10|title=Plant Developmental Biology - Biotechnological Perspectives|last=Piechulla|first=B.|last2=Effmert|first2=U.|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642046698|editor-last=Pua|editor-first=Eng Chong|pages=189–205|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-04670-4_10|editor-last2=Davey|editor-first2=Michael R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, increased temperatures in the environment can increase emission of VOCs in flowers, potentially altering communication between plants and pollinators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farré-Armengol|first=Gerard|last2=Filella|first2=Iolanda|last3=Llusià|first3=Joan|last4=Niinemets|first4=Ülo|last5=Peñuelas|first5=Josep|date=|title=Changes in floral bouquets from compound-specific responses to increasing temperatures|journal=Global Change Biology|language=en|volume=20|issue=12|pages=3660–3669|doi=10.1111/gcb.12628|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, biotic interactions may affect floral scent. Plant leaves attacked by herbivores emit new VOCs in response to the attack, the so-called herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arimura|first=Gen-ichiro|last2=Matsui|first2=Kenji|last3=Takabayashi|first3=Junji|date=2009-05-01|title=Chemical and Molecular Ecology of Herbivore-Induced Plant Volatiles: Proximate Factors and Their Ultimate Functions|url=http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/5/911|journal=Plant and Cell Physiology|language=en|volume=50|issue=5|pages=911–923|doi=10.1093/pcp/pcp030|issn=0032-0781|pmid=19246460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, damaged flowers have a modified floral scent compared to undamaged ones. Micro-organisms present in nectar may alter floral scent emissions as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peñuelas|first=Josep|last2=Farré-Armengol|first2=Gerard|last3=Llusia|first3=Joan|last4=Gargallo-Garriga|first4=Albert|last5=Rico|first5=Laura|last6=Sardans|first6=Jordi|last7=Terradas|first7=Jaume|last8=Filella|first8=Iolanda|date=2014-10-22|title=Removal of floral microbiota reduces floral terpene emissions|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep06727|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=4|doi=10.1038/srep06727|issn=2045-2322|pmc=4205883|pmid=25335793|pages=6727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
Measuring floral scent both qualitatively (identification of VOCs) and quantitatively (absolute and/or relative emission of VOCs) requires the use of [[analytical chemistry]] techniques. It requires to collect floral VOCs, and then to analyze them.

=== VOCs sampling ===
Most used methods rely on adsorbing floral VOCs on an adsorbent material such as [[Solid phase extraction#Solid-phase microextraction|SPME fibers]] or [[Solid phase extraction#Cartridges|cartridges]] by pumping air sampled around inflorescences through the adsorbent material.

It is also possible to extract chemicals stocked in petals by immersing them into a [[solvent]], and then analyze the liquid residue. This is more adapted to the study of heavier organic compounds, and/or VOCs that are stored in floral tissue before being emitted in air.

=== Sample analysis ===

==== Desorption ====
{{Main article|Desorption}}
* thermodesorption: the adsorbent material is flash-heated so that all adsorbed VOCs are carried away from the adsorbent and injected into the separation system. This is how work injectors in [[gas chromatography]] machines, which literally volatilize introduced samples. For VOCs adsorbed on bigger amount of adsorbent material such as  [[Solid phase extraction#Cartridges|cartridges]], thermodesorption may require the use of a specific machine, a thermodesorber, connected to the separation system.
* desorption by [[solvent]]: VOCs adsorbed on the adsorbent material are carried away by a small quantity of solvent which is then volatilized in injected in the separation system. Most commonly used solvents are very volatile molecules, such as [[methanol]], so as to avoid co-elution with slightly heavier VOCs

[[Gas chromatography]] (GC) is ideal to separate volatilized VOCs due to their low molecular weight. VOCs are carried by a gas vector (helium) through a chromatographic column (the solid phase) on which they have different affinities, which allows to separate them.

[[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|Liquid chromatography]] may be used for liquid extractions of floral tissue.

==== Detection and identification ====
Separation systems are coupled with a [[Gas chromatography#Detectors|detector]], that allows the detection and identification of VOCs based on their molecular weight and chemical properties. The most used system for the analysis of floral scent samples is [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|GC-MS]] (gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry).

==== Quantification ====
[[Gas chromatography#Quantitative analysis|Quantification]] of VOCs is based on the peak area measured on the chromatogram and compared to the peak area of a chemical standard:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tholl|first=Dorothea|last2=Boland|first2=Wilhelm|last3=Hansel|first3=Armin|last4=Loreto|first4=Francesco|last5=Röse|first5=Ursula S.R.|last6=Schnitzler|first6=Jörg-Peter|date=2006-02-01|title=Practical approaches to plant volatile analysis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02612.x/abstract|journal=The Plant Journal|language=en|volume=45|issue=4|pages=540–560|doi=10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02612.x|issn=1365-313X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* internal calibration: a known quantity of a specific chemical standard is injected together with the VOCs, the measured area on the chromatogram is proportional to the injected quantity. Because the chemical properties of VOCs alter their affinity to the solid phase (the chromatographic column) and subsequently the peak area on the chromatogram, it is best to use several standards that best reflect the chemical diversity of the floral scent sample. This method allows a more robust comparison among samples.
* external calibration: calibration curves (quantity vs. peak area) are established independently by the injection of a range of quantities of chemical standard. This method is best when the relative and absolute amount of VOCs in floral scent samples varies from sample to sample and from VOC to VOC and when the chemical diversity of VOCs in the sample is high. However, it is more time consuming and may be source of errors (e.g. matrix effects due to solvent or very abundant VOCs compared to trace VOCs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Ki-Hyun|last2=Kim|first2=Yong-Hyun|last3=Brown|first3=Richard J. C.|date=2013-08-02|title=Conditions for the optimal analysis of volatile organic compounds in air with sorbent tube sampling and liquid standard calibration: demonstration of solvent effect|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-013-7263-9|journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry|language=en|volume=405|issue=26|pages=8397–8408|doi=10.1007/s00216-013-7263-9|issn=1618-2642}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Specificity of floral scent analysis ===
Floral scent is often composed of hundreds of VOCs, in very variable proportions. The method used is a tradeoff between accurately detecting quantifying minor compounds and avoiding detector saturation by major compounds. For most analysis methods routinely used, the detection threshold of many VOCs is still higher than the perception threshold of insects,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macel|first=Mirka|last2=Van DAM|first2=Nicole M.|last3=Keurentjes|first3=Joost J. B.|date=2010-07-01|title=Metabolomics: the chemistry between ecology and genetics|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-0998.2010.02854.x/abstract|journal=Molecular Ecology Resources|language=en|volume=10|issue=4|pages=583–593|doi=10.1111/j.1755-0998.2010.02854.x|issn=1755-0998}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reduces our capacity to understand plant-insect interactions mediated by floral scent.

Further, the chemical diversity in floral scent samples is challenging. The time of analysis is proportional to the range in molecular weight of VOCs present in the sample, hence a high diversity will increase analysis time. Floral scent may also be composed of very similar molecules, such as [[isomer]]s and especially [[enantiomer]]s, which tend to co-elute and then to be very hardly separated. Unambiguously detecting and quantifying them is of importance though, as enantiomers may trigger very different responses in pollinators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parachnowitsch|first=Amy|last2=Burdon|first2=Rosalie C.

'''Gender-biased diagnosing''' is a controversial&lt;ref&gt;Authors V. Mark Durand, M.V. &amp; Barlow, D.H. (2009) ''Essentials of Abnormal Psychology'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=L7BZTtO5rh8C&amp;lpg=PA436&amp;dq=gender%20biased%20diagnosing&amp;pg=PA436#v=onepage&amp;q=gender%20biased%20diagnosing&amp;f=false p.436.] Cengage Learning. {{ISBN|0-495-59982-4}}. Retrieved November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sociology|sociological]] observation which asserts that [[medical diagnosis|medical]] and psychological diagnosis may be influenced by the [[gender]] of the patient. Several studies have found evidence of [[differential diagnosis]] for patients with similar ailments but of different sexes.

== Medical diagnosis ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}
The phenomenon may affect physical diagnosis. Women are more likely to be given a diagnosis of [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] nature for a [[physical ailment]] than men, despite presenting with similar symptoms. Women sometimes have trouble being taken seriously by physicians when suffering from medically unexplained [[illness]], and report difficulty receiving appropriate medical care for their illnesses because doctors repeatedly diagnose their physical complaints as related to [[Mental illness|psychiatric problems]].
Clinical offices that rely on healthcare routines become less distinct due to biased medical knowledge of gender.  There is a distinct differentiation between gender and sex in the medical sense. Gender is the societal construction of what femininity and masculinity is, whereas, sex is the biological aspect that defines the dichotomy of female and male. The way of lifestyle and the place in society are often considered when diagnosing patients.&lt;ref&gt;Hamberg, K. (2008). Gender bias in medicine. Women's Health (London, England), 4(3), 237-243.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to traditional medical studies, most of these medical studies were done on men thus overlooking many issues that were related to women's health. This topic alone sparked controversy and brought about question to the medical standard of our time. Research that was done on diseases that affected women more were less funded than those diseases that affected men and women equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Trechak A | year = 1999 | title = On cultural and gender bias in medical diagnosis | url = | journal = Multicultural Education | volume = 7 | issue = 2| page = 41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an example of gender bias in the psychiatric field as well, Hamburg notes that, "psychiatrists would diagnose women with depression and then, eventually psychiatrists would begin to assume that women were more depressed than men due to the fact that the patients that were examined by the psychiatrists were women and they had similar symptoms. As for the men, they were diagnosed with drug or alcohol problems and they were thrown out of the study."&lt;ref&gt;Hamberg, Katarina. "Gender Bias in Medicine." Women's Health (London, England), 4.3 (2008): 237-243.&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the Women's Health Equity Act that was passed in 1993, this Act gave women the chance to participate in medical studies and examine the gender differences.&lt;ref&gt;WOMEN'S HEALTH EQUITY ACT of 1993. Congressional Record Daily Edition. n.p.: 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Women's Health Equity Act was introduced there was no research done on infertility, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer which were essential to women's health.&lt;ref&gt;THE WOMEN'S HEALTH EQUITY ACT of 1991. Congressional Record Daily Edition. n.p.: 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychological diagnosis ==
There is a suggestion that assumptions regarding gender specific behavioural characteristics can lead to a diagnostic system which is biased.&lt;ref&gt;Maddux, J.E. &amp; Winstead, B.A. (2005) ''Psychopathology: foundations for a contemporary understanding'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=2SJpF8ucrKgC&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=gender%20biased%20diagnosing&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q=gender%20biased%20diagnosing&amp;f=false p.77.] Routledge. {{ISBN|0-8058-4077-X}} Retrieved November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of gender bias with regard to ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) [[personality disorder]] criteria has been controversial and widely debated. The fourth DSM (4th ed., text revision; DSM–IV–TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) makes no explicit statement regarding gender bias among the ten personality disorders (PDs), but it does state that six PDs (antisocial, narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, schizotypal, schizoid) are more frequently found in men. Three others (borderline, histrionic, dependent) are more frequent in women. Avoidant is equally common in men and women.

There are many ways to interpret differential prevalence rates as a function of gender. Some critics have argued that they are an artifact of gender bias. In other words, the PD criteria assume unfairly that stereotypical female characteristics are pathological. The results of this study conclude with no indication of gender-biased criteria in the [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]], [[histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]], and [[dependent personality disorder|dependent]] PDs. This is in contrast with what is predicted by critics of these disorders, who suggest they are biased against women. It is possible, however, that other sources of bias, including assessment and clinical bias,  are still at work in relation to these disorders. The results do show that the group means are higher in women than in men, an expected result considering the higher prevalence rate of these disorders for women.&lt;ref&gt;Jane, J. S., Oltmanns, T. F., South, S. C., &amp; Turkheimer, E. (2007) "Gender bias in diagnostic criteria for personality disorders: An item response theory analysis" Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 116(1), 166-175&lt;/ref&gt;

The original purpose of the DSM–IV was to provide an accurate classification of [[psychopathology]], not to develop a diagnostic system that will, democratically, diagnose as many men with a personality disorder as women". However, if the criteria are to serve equally as indicators of disorder for both men and women, it will be important to establish that the implications of these criteria for functional impairment are comparable for both sexes. Whereas it is plausible that there are gender-specific expressions of these disorders, DSM–IV criteria that function differentially for men and women can systematically over-pathologize or under-represent mental illness in a particular gender. The present study is limited by the investigation of only four personality disorders and the lack of inclusion of additional diagnoses that have also been controversial in the gender bias debate (such as dependent and histrionic personality disorders), although it offers a clearly articulated methodology for studying this possibility. In addition, it provides an examination of a clinical sample of substantial size and uses functional assessments that cut across multiple functional domains and multiple assessment methods. Our results indicate that BPD criteria showed some evidence of differential functioning between genders on global functioning, although there is little evidence of sex bias within the diagnostic criteria for [[avoidant personality disorder|avoidant]], [[schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]], or [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]]s. Further investigation and validation across sexes for those disorders would be an important direction of future research.&lt;ref&gt;Boggs, C. D., Morey, L. C., Skodol, A. E., Shea, M. T., Sanislow, C. A., Grilo, C. M., et al. (2009) "Differential impairment as an indicator of sex bias in DSM-IV criteria for four personality disorders" Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment, S(1), 61-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerable evidence indicates a prominent role for [[psychological trauma|trauma]]-related cognitions in the development and maintenance of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) symptoms. The present study utilized [[regression analysis]] to examine the unique relationships between various trauma-related cognitions and PTSD symptoms after controlling for gender and measures of general affective distress in a large sample of trauma-exposed college students. In terms of trauma-related cognitions, only negative cognitions about the self were related to PTSD symptom severity. Gender and anxiety symptoms were also related to PTSD symptom severity. Theoretical implications of the results are consistent with previous studies on the relationship between PTSD and negative cognitions, the self, world, and blame subscales of the PTCI were significantly related to PTSD symptoms. The study correlations indicated that increased negative trauma-related cognitions were related to more severe PTSD symptoms. Also consistent with previous reports, correlations also indicated that gender was related to PTSD symptom severity, such that women had more severe PTSD symptoms. PTSD symptom severity was also positively related to depression, anxiety, and stress reactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Moser J. S. |author2=Hajcak G. |author3=Simons R. F. |author4=Foa E.

Distinguishing between borderline personality disorder (BPD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is often challenging, especially when the client has experienced a trauma such as [[childhood sexual abuse]] (CSA), which is strongly linked to both disorders. Although the individual diagnostic criteria for these two disorders do not overlap substantially, patients with either of these disorders can display similar clinical pictures. Both patients with BPD and PTSD may present as aggressive toward self or others, irritable, unable to tolerate emotional extremes, dysphoric, feeling empty or dead, and highly reactive to mild stressors. Despite having similar clinical pictures, PTSD and BPD are regarded differently by many clinicians. Results from a 2009 study concluded that patient gender does not affect diagnosis. This finding is consistent with research suggesting that women are not more likely to be given the BPD diagnosis, all else being equal, though it contradicts other findings from studies that have used similar case vignettes. Nor did the data support an effect of clinician gender or age on diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, H. E., Taft, C. T., Gordon, R. A., &amp; Meis, L. A. (2009) "Clinician bias in the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder"  Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy, 1(4), 282-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study examined gender-specific associations between trauma cognitions, alcohol cravings and alcohol-related consequences in individuals with dually diagnosed PTSD and [[alcohol dependence]] (AD). Participants had entered a treatment study for concurrent PTSD and AD; baseline information was collected from participants about PTSD-related cognitions in three areas: (a) Negative Cognitions About Self, (b) Negative Cognitions About the World, and (c) Self-Blame. Information was also collected on two aspects of AD: alcohol cravings and consequences of AD. Gender differences were examined while controlling for PTSD severity. The results indicate that Negative Cognitions About Self are significantly related to alcohol cravings in men but not women, and that interpersonal consequences of AD are significantly related to Self-Blame in women but not in men. These findings suggest that for individuals with comorbid PTSD and AD, psychotherapeutic interventions that focus on reducing trauma-related cognitions are likely to reduce alcohol cravings in men and relational problems in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jayawickreme N. |author2=Yasinski C. |author3=Williams M. |author4=Foa E.

A naturally occurring soil bacterium ''[[Agrobacterium rhizogenes]]'' that contains root-inducing plasmids (also called Ri plasmids) can infect plant roots and cause them to produce a food source for the bacterium, [[opines]], and to grow abnormally.&lt;ref name=Shanks&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0958-1669(99)80026-3 |vauthors=Shanks JV, Morgan J |title=Plant 'hairy root' culture |journal=Curr.

'''Incarceration prevention''' refers to a variety of methods aimed at reducing prison populations and costs while fostering enhanced social structures. Due to the nature of [[incarceration in the United States]] today caused by issues leading to increased incarceration rates, there are methods aimed at preventing the incarceration of at-risk populations.

== Prison population and cost to society==

{{See also|United States incarceration rate}}

Between 1998 and 2010, prison populations in the United States rose dramatically. This resulted in overcrowded facilities; increased expense to taxpayers; and potential loss of public funding for other community safety activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Examining growth in the federal prison population, 1998 to 2010|url=http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/412720-Examining-Growth-in-the-Federal-Prison-Population.pdf|year=2012|publisher=Urban Institute|location=Washington, D.C.|author=Kamala Kane|author2=Barbara Parthasarathy|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1982 and 2007, corrections expenditures increased by over 250 percent and in 2007 expenditure was over $74 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kyckelhahn|first=Tracey|title=Justice Expenditures and  Employment, FY 1982-2007|date=December 2011|publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/jee8207st.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the number of youths in detention facilities was 61,423.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Center for Juvenile Justice|url=http://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/ezacjrp/asp/selection.asp|publisher=Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice.|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2012, approximately 2,228,400 individuals were incarcerated in jails and prisons, about 4,781,300 individuals were under some form of community supervision (such as probation or parole), and a total of approximately 6,937,600 individuals were under some form of correctional supervision (1 in 35 adults).&lt;ref name="bjs"&gt;{{cite web|title = Correctional Populations in the United States, 2012|url = http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cpus12.pdf|work = Office of Justice Programs Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin|publisher = U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate = 24 February 2014|author = Lauren Glaze|author2 = Erinn Herberman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average cost of the incarceration of an individual in 2012 was approximately $31,286 per year with a range of $14,603 to $60,076.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Price of Prisons: What Incarceration Costs Taxpayers|date=January 2012|publisher=The VERA Institute of Justice Center on Sentencing and Corrections|location=New York|url=http://www.vera.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/Price_of_Prisons_updated_version_072512.pdf|author=Christian Henrichson|author2=Ruth Delaney|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Economic Interest Convergence in Downsizing Imprisonment|ssrn = 2608698|publisher = Social Science Research Network|date = 2014-01-01|location = Rochester, NY|last = SpearIt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2015, the United States has the second highest incarceration rate in the world with 698 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref name=Walmsley2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walmsley|first1=Roy|title=World Prison Population List (Eleventh Edition)|url=http://www.prisonstudies.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/world_prison_population_list_11th_edition_0.pdf|website=World Prison Brief|publisher=Institute For Criminal Policy Research|accessdate=25 November 2017|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other locations, 55% of countries and territories have prison rates lower than 155 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref name=Walmsley2015 /&gt; The average cost of incarceration rose to $31,977.65 in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Federal Bureau of Prisons|first1=Justice Department|title=Annual Determination of Average Cost of Incarceration|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/19/2016-17040/annual-determination-of-average-cost-of-incarceration|website=Federal Register|accessdate=25 November 2017|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors contributing to incarceration rates==

=== Substance use disorder prevention or treatment ===

Between 1980 and 2005, the number of inmates incarcerated for drug-related crimes increased by 1,000 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stemen|first=Don|title=Reconsidering Incarceration: New Directions for Reducing Crime|date=January 2007|publisher=VERA Institute of Justice Center on Sentencing and Corrections|pages=8|url=http://www.vera.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/veraincarc_vFW2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, sixty-five percent of inmates reported a substance addiction or dependence issue.&lt;ref name = casa&gt;{{cite book|title=Shoveling Up II: The Impact of Substance Abuse on Federal, State and Local Budgets|date=May 2009|publisher=The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University|location=New York, NY|url=http://www.casacolumbia.org/modal_forms/nojs/webform/161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seventy-eight percent of violent crimes and eighty-three percent of property crimes involved drugs.&lt;ref name=casa /&gt; A greater amount of money is spent on incarceration than on prevention and treatment, despite research showing that treating drug addictions is more cost-effective than incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wachendorfer|first=Allan|title=Casualties of the Drug War|journal=Senior Honors Thesis|year=2013|issue=Paper 361|url=http://commons.emich.edu/honors/361}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]], a full year of drug treatment costs approximately $4,700 compared to over $30,000 for a year of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is drug addiction treatment worth its cost?|url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/principles-drug-addiction-treatment-research-based-guide-third-edition/frequently-asked-questions/drug-addiction-treatment-worth-its-cost|publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mental health access/treatment ===

According to statistics produced by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] in September 2006, over 45% of federal prisoners, 56% of state prisoners, and 64% of jail inmates are [[Mentally ill prisoners in the United States|diagnosed with mental health problems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report: Mental Health Problems of Prison  and Jail Inmates|date=September 2006|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/mhppji.pdf|author=Doris James|author2=Lauren Glaze|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests a direct correlation between a decrease in mental health services and facilities and an increase in mental health diagnoses in the prison system. A decrease in mental health funding has taken place on both the state and federal level, especially in changes in block grant funding as part of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981. The statewide support for mental health services has also seen significant cuts and has barely accounted for annual inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funding for Mental Health Services and Programs|url=//www.bazelon.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=GzmAbAweikQ%3D&amp;tabid=436|publisher=Judge David L. Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall shift from institution-based care to a community-based care model was one that many mental health advocates welcomed; however, the funding appropriated to support such programs was much less than initial estimates and has had a significant impact on the ability of the community care based model to be successful in providing adequate mental health treatment to those in need.&lt;ref&gt;NAMI - State Mental Health Cuts : A National Crisis http://www.nami.org/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm?ContentFileID=126233&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===

{{See also|School-to-prison pipeline}}

68% of state prison inmates did not receive a high school diploma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report: Education and Correctional Populations|date=January 2003|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ecp.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that schooling significantly reduces criminal activity. A significant portion of the effect of education on crime can be attributed to an increase in wages associated with schooling, suggesting that an increased level of education funding will result in decreased criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The E®ect of Education on Crime: Evidence from Prison Inmates, Arrests, and Self-Reports|date=October 2003|url=http://emlab.berkeley.edu/~moretti/lm46.pdf|author=Lance Lochner|author2=Enrico Moretti|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors involving race ===

{{see also|Race and the War on Drugs|Stop-and-frisk in New York City|Arizona SB 1070|Race and crime in the United States}}

There are many factors that have direct connections with the rises in the incarcerated population, many of which relate to structural and societal biases that exist in America today. As it relates directly to race, the practice of racial profiling regards policies and personal biases that target minority racial groups and contribute to a greater proportion of minorities being incarcerated compared to the general population. Currently, over sixty percent of inmates in the United States are people of color.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/news/2012/03/13/11351/the-top-10-most-startling-facts-about-people-of-color-and-criminal-justice-in-the-united-states/&lt;/ref&gt; These practices have existed in the American Criminal Justice system for decades and although may have gained attention in recent years, still find ways to increase the likelihood of certain demographic groups receiving negative attention from the likes of law enforcement.

=== The war on drugs and longer prison sentences ===

Beginning in the Nixon administration, the war on drugs resulted in stricter drug laws including longer prison sentences for drug use and possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Travis|first1=Jeremy|last2=Western|first2=Bruce|last3=Redburn|first3=F. Stevens|title=The Growth of Incarceration in the United States: Exploring Causes and Consequences|date=2014|publisher=The National Academic Press|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=118–121|url=https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&amp;context=jj_pubs|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that the drug offender population in federal prisons rose by 63% from 1998 to 2012 and they accounted for 52% of federal prisoners by 2012.&lt;ref name=Taxy2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taxy|first1=Sam|last2=Samuels|first2=Julie|last3=Adams|first3=William|title=Drug Offenders in Federal Prison: Estimates of Characteristics Based on Linked Data|url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/dofp12.pdf|website=Bureau of Justice Statistics|accessdate=27 November 2017|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 35% of these drug offenders were not reoffenders or had minimal criminal backgrounds.&lt;ref name=Taxy2015 /&gt;

In relation, mandatory minimum penalties have contributed to mass incarceration. The United States Sentencing Commission found that in 2016, 67.3% of offenders charged of a crime with a mandatory minimum penalty were convicted of a drug offense.&lt;ref name=USSC2017&gt;{{cite web|last1=United States Sentencing Commission|title=An Overview of Mandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System|url=https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/research-publications/2017/20170711_Mand-Min.pdf|accessdate=27 November 2017|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission also found that in 2016, the average sentence length was 110 months in prison compared to 28 months for those charged of a crime with no mandatory minimum penalty.&lt;ref name=USSC2017 /&gt;

== Incarceration prevention ==

Incarceration prevention refers to a variety of methods aimed at reducing prison populations and costs while fostering enhanced social structures for the improvement of society. Incarceration prevention can take place in any of three stages: Primary Prevention, Diversion, or Recidivism Prevention.

===Prevention===

Primary prevention is an attempt to reduce the risk of behaviors that potentially lead to incarceration. The initial stage in this model includes looking at system wide or systemic approaches that ensure people have consistent social and structural interactions.

==== Safety nets ====

Studies suggest that crime and violence are likely to be a byproduct of issues including economic inequality and poverty.&lt;ref name=worldbank&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourguignon|first=F.|title=Facets of globalization international and local dimensions of development|year=2001|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-8213-4742-X|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/14014|accessdate=25 February 2014|format=print|chapter=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic theory shows how property crime and violent crimes may partly be consequences of excessive inequality and poverty.&lt;ref name=worldbank /&gt; Not only do crime rates increase with inequality, but propensity to commit crimes also increases with greater income inequality or poverty.&lt;ref name=worldbank /&gt; It follows that programs which elevate families out of poverty decrease behaviors associated with crime. National data indicates that a 10% increase in real wages lowers the crime index by 13%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stemen|first=Don|title=New Directions for Reducing Crime|journal=Federal Sentencing Reporter|date=April 2007|volume=19|issue=4|pages=221–233|doi=10.1525/fsr.2007.19.4.221|jstor=10.1525/fsr.2007.19.4.221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Youth justice ====

{{See also|School-to-prison pipeline}}

Often, primary prevention can be viewed in the context of a school or vocational program in which there is a system of disciplinary action and reactions to behavioral issues. The goal is to institute preventive measures and different methods of support (i.e., restorative justice, restorative circles, proactive circles, and peer mediation) that encourage students/youth to meet the behavioral and academic standards set before them, without instituting harsh punitive measures that disengage students from educational and social resources provided within a school environment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

=== Diversion ===

Diversion is an attempt to circumvent incarceration and correct problem behaviors after an offense have been committed through alternatives to incarceration. This includes identifying those "most at risk" and setting in place additional supportive measures and strategies to provide opportunities for success.

In a school setting, this most often takes place after a young person has had multiple behavioral incidences within a short period of time and is at risk for more serious punitive measures. Steps for intervention may include (but are not limited to): additional counseling and support services, conflict resolution measures, peer-to-peer resolution groups, and engagement with community partners to provide additional services. The goal is to provide opportunities and support for those who show persistent behavioral issues, as they are most at-risk for future incarceration and/or legal trouble.&lt;ref&gt;EDJ Model: Secondary http://www.edjj.org/prevention/LevelsPrevention.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Deferred sentencing and jail diversion ====

Including but not limited to:
                    	
*[[Alternative sentencing|Community Service]]: Community sentence or alternative sentencing or non-custodial sentence is a collective name in criminal justice for all the different ways, in which courts can punish someone convicted of committing an offense in ways other than prison terms.
*[[Drug courts in the United States|Drug courts]]: Drug courts operate under a model that combines intensive judicial supervision, mandatory drug testing, escalating sanctions and treatment to help substance abusers break the cycle of addiction and the crime that accompanies it.
*[[Mental health court]]s: Mental health courts link offenders who would ordinarily be prison-bound to long-term community-based treatment. They rely on mental health assessments, individualized treatment plans, and ongoing judicial monitoring to address both the mental health needs of offenders and public safety concerns of communities.
*[[Domestic violence court]]s: Specialized domestic violence courts are designed to improve victim safety and enhance defendant accountability. They emerged as problem-solving courts in the 1980s and 1990s in response to frustration among victim advocates, judges and attorneys who saw the same litigants cycling through the justice system.
*[[Problem-solving courts in the United States|Problem-solving courts]]: Problem-solving courts address the underlying problems that contribute to criminal behavior and are a current trend in the legal system of the United States. There were over 2,800 problem-solving courts in 2008, intended to provide a method of resolving the problem in order to reduce recidivism.
*[[Restorative justice in social work|Restorative justice]]: Restorative justice uses dialogue to address the harm that has been done rather than relying solely on jail time as a means of justice.
*[[Ankle monitor|Electronic Monitoring]]: Electronic monitoring is a device that individuals under house arrest or parole are often required to wear. At timed intervals, the ankle monitor sends a radio frequency signal containing location and other information to a receiver. If an offender moves outside of an allowed range, the police will be notified.
*[[Deferred prosecution|Fines/Probation]]: A deferred prosecution agreement is a voluntary alternative to adjudication in which a prosecutor agrees to grant amnesty in exchange for the defendant agreeing to fulfill certain requirements. Fulfillment of the specified requirements will then result in dismissal of the charges.
*[[Diversion program]]s: A diversion program in the criminal justice system is a form of sentencing and such programs are often run by a police department, court, a district attorney's office, or outside agency designed to enable offenders of criminal law to avoid criminal charges and a criminal record.

===Recidivism prevention===

[[Recidivism]] prevention takes place during incarceration and after release back into society. Its purpose is to reduce the risk of an individual reoffending and eventually returning into the prison system. National rates of recidivism over the last three decades have remained relatively steady at approximately 43 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=State of Recidivism April 2011 The Revolving Door of America’s Prisons|date=April 2011|publisher=The Pew Center on States|page=2|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/sentencing_and_corrections/State_Recidivism_Revolving_Door_America_Prisons%20.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendations provided by the "Report of the Re-Entry Policy Council" coordinated by the "Council of State Governments"  reflect the opportunities available for action by entities interested in reducing recidivism. According to the report, there are steps policy makers or practitioners should complete in order to ensure successful programs, such as collaboration, proper funding, system integration, and educating the public. The report also states that policy makers must also consider additional programming needs for incoming offenders, including intake procedures, physical and mental health care, drug treatment, and vocational training. Finally, the report emphasizes the need to address changes in social service delivery, such as housing, workforce development, treatment programs, and mental and physical healthcare systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schrantz|first=Dennis|title=Coordinating Community Development: The Heart of the Michigan Prisoner ReEntry Initiative|journal=Corrections Today Magazine|date=April 2007|volume=69|issue=2|pages=42–49|publisher=http://www.aca.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prison reform ====

Prison reform seeks to advocate for programming that gives offenders the tools they need for success. Physical and mental health, drug treatment, and educational and vocational programming give offenders the opportunity to begin the process of returning to their communities to become contributing members before they leave the facility.

==== Prisoner reentry initiatives  ====

{{See also|National Criminal Justice Association#Prisoner Reentry|l1=Prisoner reentry}}

The overall purpose of such programs is to provide options, support, and opportunities for prisoners returning home into communities. The goal of preventing crime and reducing recidivism is attained through support programs including vocational and educational programs that provide returning citizens with the skills necessary to succeed in their reintegrated lives. The programs typically start by assessing strengths and risk factors through assessments when offenders begin their sentences, effective support and a plan for success that includes community support, and different strategies to help remediate skill and social deficiencies typically experienced by returning citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Washtenaw Prisoner Re-Entry Program.http://washtenawprisonerreentry.org/contactus.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Juvenile confinement rates on steady decline ==

A study published by the Pew Institute found that there has been a significant decline in at least 37 states for juvenile commitment and violent crime arrest rates between 1997 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latest Data Show Juvenile Confinement Continues Rapid Decline|url=http://www.pewstates.org/news-room/press-releases/latest-data-show-juvenile-confinement-continues-rapid-decline-85899480842#four|publisher=The Pew Charitable Trust State and Consumer Initiatives|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These decreases in juvenile commitments can be a result of many different factors, including unique programs like the Ohio RECLAIM (Reasonable Equitable Community and Local Alternatives to the Incarceration of Minors) program. This program provides financial incentives that encourage juvenile courts to find and develop community based strategies and programs options that seek to meet the needs of juvenile offenders or at risk offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ohio Reclaim|url=http://www.dys.ohio.gov/dnn/Community/ReclaimOhio/tabid/131/Default.aspx|publisher=Ohio Department of Youth Services|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program works to focus the most critical resources for the most serious offenders, such as those committing violent crimes and the most serious of offenses, while encouraging courts to look into community and restorative program placements for the youth who commit crimes not fitting such severe categories. As a result, Ohio has seen a significant decrease in institutional crowding and an 80% decrease in Department of Youth Services (DYS) caseloads from its peak in 1997 to 2012.

This is a list of '''''Whaling Walls''''', which are large outdoor [[mural]]s by the artist [[Robert Wyland]], featuring images of life-size [[gray whale]]s, breaching [[humpback whale]]s, [[blue whale]]s, and other sea life. ''Whaling Walls'' (a pun on the [[Wailing Wall]]) are created by invitation of the communities, institutions, and building owners of the structures on which they are painted. The one hundredth and possibly final ''Whaling Wall'' was painted in [[Beijing]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[[Environment News Service|ENS]] (27 June 2008). [http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/green/Wyland_to_Paint_100th_Whaling_Wall_Mural_in_Beijing_All__National_.html "Wyland to Paint 100th Whaling Wall Mural in Beijing"]. NBC New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Marine Station of Endoume''' is an [[oceanography]] and [[marine biology]] research institute located in [[Marseille]] (France). It was founded in 1882 by [[Antoine-Fortuné Marion]] (1846–1900). It is today one of the sites for the joint research unit IMBE&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imbe.fr/|title=IMBE website|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Mediterranean Institute of marine and terrestrial Biodiversity and Ecology) hosting research teams from [[Aix-Marseille University]] and the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]]. 

== History ==
The first [[marine biology]] laboratory in France outside Paris was founded in [[Marseille]] in 1869. The project to build a marine station in [[Marseille]] was initiated by its director [[Antoine-Fortuné Marion]] in 1872 and accepted in 1882. The station was built between 1883 and 1889, on the site of an old artillery battery in the neighbourhood of [[Endoume]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marion|first=A.-F.|year=1897|title=La Station zoologique d’Endoume-Marseille|journal=Revue générale internationale scientifique, littéraire et artistique|volume=14|pages=179–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The first scientific studies started in the summer of 1889. 

In 1891, the first public aquarium in Marseille opened at the marine station; in 1894, a marine natural reserve was created right in front of the marine station&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Romano|first=R.|year=1996|title=Histoire d’une station marine à Marseille : origine, naissance, développement (1869–1983)|journal=Master thesis, Université Aix-Marseille 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A-F Marion was director of the station until his death in 1900.

'''Mineralized tissues''' are biological [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] that incorporate minerals into soft matrices. Typically these tissues form a protective shield or structural support.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt; Bone, [[mollusk shell|mollusc shells]], deep sea sponge ''Euplectella'' species, [[radiolarians]], [[diatoms]], [[antler]] bone, [[tendon]], [[cartilage]], [[tooth enamel]] and [[dentin]] are some examples of mineralized tissues.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name='Barthelat2007'&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Barthelat | first1 = F.| title = Biomimetics for next generation materials| journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

These tissues have been finely tuned to enhance their mechanical capabilities over millions of years of evolution. Thus, mineralized tissues have been the subject of many studies since there is a lot to learn from nature as seen from the growing field of [[biomimetics]].&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt; The remarkable structural organization and engineering properties makes these tissues desirable candidates for duplication by artificial means.&lt;ref name='Espinosa2009'&gt;{{Cite journal| journal = Progress in Materials Science| title = Merger of structure and material in nacre and bone – Perspectives on de novo biomimetic materials| volume = 54| pages = 1059–1100| doi = 10.1016/j.pmatsci.2009.05.001| year = 2009| last1 = Espinosa | first4 = M.

While natural materials are made up of a limited number of components, a larger variety of material chemistries can be used to simulate the same properties in engineering applications. However, the success of biomimetics lies in fully grasping the performance and mechanics of these biological hard tissues before swapping the natural components with artificial materials for engineering design.&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;

Mineralized tissues combine stiffness, low weight, strength and toughness due to the presence of minerals (the [[Inorganic compound|inorganic]] part) in soft protein networks and tissues (the [[Organic compound|organic]] part).&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt; There are approximately 60 different minerals generated through biological processes, but the most common ones are [[calcium carbonate]] found in mollusk shells and [[hydroxyapatite]] present in teeth and bones.&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt; Although one might think that the mineral content of these tissues can make them fragile, studies have shown that mineralized tissues are 1,000 to 10,000 times tougher than the minerals they contain.&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://barthelat-lab.mcgill.ca/research.html The Biomimetic Materials Laboratory]''&lt;/ref&gt; The secret to this underlying strength is in the organized layering of the tissue. Due to this layering, loads and stresses are transferred throughout several length-scales, from macro to micro to nano, which results in the dissipation of energy within the arrangement. These scales or hierarchical structures are therefore able to distribute damage and resist cracking.&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt; Two types of biological tissues have been the target of extensive investigation, namely [[nacre]] from mollusk shells and bone, which are both high performance natural composites.&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name='FBarthelat2007'&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 47| pages = 311| year = 2007| doi = 10.1007/s11340-007-9040-1| last1 = Barthelat| journal = Experimental Mechanics | first1 = F.| title = An Experimental Investigation of Deformation and Fracture of Nacre–Mother of Pearl| last2 = Espinosa | first2 = H.

For example, kidney stones contain mineralized tissues that are developed through pathologic processes. Hence, [[biomineralization]] is an important process to understand how these diseases occur.&lt;ref name="Boskey2005" /&gt;

==Evolution==
The evolution of mineralized tissues has been puzzling for more than a century. It has been hypothesized that the first mechanism of mammalian tissue mineralization began either in the oral skeleton of [[conodont]] or the dermal skeleton of early [[agnathans]]. The dermal skeleton is just surface [[dentin]] and basal bone, which is sometimes overlaid by enameloid. It is thought that the dermal skeleton eventually became scales, which are homologous to teeth. Teeth were first seen in [[chondrichthyans]] and were made from all three components of the dermal skeleton, namely dentin, basal bone and enameloid. The mineralization mechanism of mammalian tissue was later elaborated in [[actinopterygians]] and [[sarcopterygians]] during bony fish evolution. It is expected that genetic analysis of [[agnathans]] will provide more insight into the evolution of mineralized tissues and clarify evidence from early fossil records.&lt;ref name='Kawasaki2004'&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 11356–11361| issue = 31| year = 2004| pmid = 15272073| doi = 10.1073/pnas.0404279101| pmc = 509207| volume = 101| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America| last2 = Suzuki | first1 = K. | first2 = T.| last3 = Weiss| title = Genetic basis for the evolution of vertebrate mineralized tissue | first3 = K.| last1 = Kawasaki|bibcode = 2004PNAS..10111356K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hierarchical structure==
Hierarchical structures are distinct features seen throughout different length scales.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt; To understand how the hierarchical structure of mineralized tissues contributes to their remarkable properties, those for nacre and bone are described below.&lt;ref name='FFBarthelat2007'&gt;{{Cite journal| journal = Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids| title = On the mechanics of mother-of-pearl: A key feature in the material hierarchical structure | first5 = H.| volume = 55| pages = 306| doi = 10.1016/j.jmps.2006.07.007| year = 2007| last1 = Barthelat| last5 = Espinosa| last2 = Tang | first1 = F. | first2 = H.| last3 = Zavattieri| last4 = Li | first3 = P. | first4 = C.| issue = 2|bibcode = 2007JMPSo..55..306B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hierarchical structures are characteristic of biology and are seen in all structural materials in biology such as bone &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=pradhan|first1=Shashindra | title=Structural Hierarchy Controls Deformation Behavior of Collagen| journal=Biomacromolecules|date=July 18, 2012|volume=13|issue=8|pages=2562–2569|doi=10.1021/bm300801a}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nacre from seashells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katti|first1=Kalpana|title=Why is Nacre so strong and tough?|journal=Materials Science and Engineering C|date=October 5, 2005|volume=26|issue=8|pages=1317–1324|doi=10.1016/j.msec.2005.08.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nacre===
Nacre has several hierarchical structural levels.&lt;ref name="FFBarthelat2007" /&gt;

====The macroscale====
[[Image:Brick and mortar.pdf|thumb|350px|Hierarchical structure: brick and mortar concept]]
Some mollusk shells protect themselves from predators by using a two layered system, one of which is nacre.&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FFBarthelat2007" /&gt; Nacre constitutes the inner layer while the other, outer, layer is made from [[calcite]].&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FFBarthelat2007" /&gt; The latter is hard and thus prevents any penetration through the shell, but is subject to brittle failure. On the other hand, nacre is softer and can uphold inelastic deformations, which makes it tougher than the hard outer shell.&lt;ref name="FFBarthelat2007" /&gt; The mineral found in nacre is [[aragonite]], CaCO3, and it occupies 95% vol. Nacre is 3000 times tougher than aragonite and this has to do with the other component in nacre, the one that takes up 5% vol., which is the softer organic biopolymers.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;  Furthermore, the nacreous layer also contains some strands of weaker material called growth lines that can deflect cracks.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;

====The microscale====
The Microscale can be imagined by a three-dimensional brick and mortar wall. The bricks would be 0.5 μm thick layers of microscopic aragonite polygonal tablets approximately 5-8 μm in diameter. What holds the bricks together are the mortars and in the case of nacre, it is the 20-30&amp;nbsp;nm organic material that plays this role.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt; Even though these tablets are usually illustrated as flat sheets, different microscopy techniques have shown that they are wavy in nature with amplitudes as large as half of the tablet's thickness.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt; This waviness plays an important role in the fracture of nacre as it will progressively lock the tablets when they are pulled apart and induce hardening.&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;

====The nanoscale====
The 30&amp;nbsp;nm thick interface between the tablets that connects them together and the [[aragonite]] grains detected by scanning electron microscopy from which the tablets themselves are made of together represent another structural level. The organic material “gluing” the tablets together is made of proteins and [[chitin]].&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;

To summarize, on the macroscale, the shell, its two layers ([[nacre]] and [[calcite]]), and weaker strands inside nacre represent three hierarchical structures. On the microscale, the stacked tablet layers and the wavy interface between them are two other hierarchical structures. Lastly, on the nanoscale, the connecting organic material between the tablets as well as the grains from which they are made of is the final sixth hierarchical structure in nacre.&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;

===Bone===
Like nacre and the other mineralized tissues, [[bone]] has a hierarchical structure that is also formed by the self-assembly of smaller components. The mineral in bone (known as [[bone mineral]]) is [[hydroxyapatite]] with a lot of carbonate ions, while the organic portion is made mostly of [[collagen]] and some other proteins. The hierarchical structural of bone spans across to a three tiered hierarchy of the collagen molecule itself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Different sources report different numbers of hierarchical level in bone, which is a complex biological material.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name='Hellmich2004'&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Hellmich | first1 = C.| last2 = Ulm | first2 = F. J.| title = Micromechanical Model for Ultrastructural Stiffness of Mineralized Tissues| journal = Journal of Engineering Mechanics| volume = 128| issue = 8| pages = 898| year = 2002| doi = 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(2002)128:8(898)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The types of mechanisms that operate at different structural length scales are yet to be properly defined.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt; Five hierarchical structures of bone are presented below.&lt;ref name="Hellmich2004" /&gt;

====The macroscale====
Compact bone and spongy bone are on a scale of several millimetres to 1 or more centimetres.&lt;ref name="Hellmich2004" /&gt;

====The microscale====
There are two hierarchical structures on the microscale. The first, at a scale of 100 μm to 1&amp;nbsp;mm, is inside the compact bone where cylindrical units called [[osteons]] and small struts can be distinguished.&lt;ref name="Hellmich2004" /&gt; The second hierarchical structure, the ultrastructure, at a scale of 5 to 10 μm, is the actual structure of the osteons and small struts.&lt;ref name="Hellmich2004" /&gt;

====The nanoscale====
There are also two hierarchical structures on the nanoscale. The first being the structure inside the ultrastructure that are fibrils and extrafibrillar space, at a scale of several hundred nanometres. The second are the elementary components of mineralized tissues at a scale of tens of nanometres. The components are the mineral crystals of [[hydroxyapatite]], cylindrical [[collagen]] molecules, organic molecules such as lipids and proteins, and finally water.&lt;ref name="Hellmich2004" /&gt; The hierarchical structure common to all mineralized tissues is the key to their mechanical performance.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;

==Mineral component==
The mineral is the inorganic component of mineralized tissues. This constituent is what makes the tissues harder and stiffer.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt; [[Hydroxyapatite]], [[calcium carbonate]], [[silica]], [[calcium oxalate]], [[whitlockite]], and monosodium urate are examples of minerals found in biological tissues.&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boskey2005" /&gt; In mollusc shells, these minerals are carried to the site of mineralization in vesicles within specialized cells. Although they are in an [[amorphous]] mineral phase while inside the [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]], the mineral destabilizes as it passes out of the cell and crystallizes.&lt;ref name='Addadi2005'&gt;{{Cite journal| issue = 4| volume = 12| journal = Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)| pages = 980–987| year = 2006| doi = 10.1002/chem.200500980| pmid = 16315200| title = Mollusk shell formation: a source of new concepts for understanding biomineralization processes | first4 = S.| last2 = Joester | first1 = L. | first2 = D.| last3 = Nudelman| last4 = Weiner | first3 = F.| last1 = Addadi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In bone, studies have shown that [[calcium phosphate]] nucleates within the hole area of the collagen fibrils and then grows in these zones until it occupies the maximum space.&lt;ref name="Fratzl1991" /&gt;

==Organic component==
The organic part of mineralized tissues is made of proteins.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt; In bone for example, the organic layer is the protein collagen.&lt;ref name="Boskey2005" /&gt; The degree of mineral in mineralized tissues varies and the organic component occupies a smaller volume as tissue [[hardness]] increases.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name='Currey2003'&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 517–522| issue = 1538| year = 2004| pmid = 15129962| doi = 10.1098/rspb.2003.2634| pmc = 1691617| volume = 271| journal = Proceedings: Biological Sciences| last2 = Brear | first1 = J. | first2 = K.| last3 = Zioupos| title = Notch sensitivity of mammalian mineralized tissues in impact | first3 = P.| last1 = Currey}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, without this organic portion, the biological material would be [[brittle]] and break easily.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt; Hence, the organic component of mineralized tissues increases their [[toughness]].&lt;ref name='Meyers2008'&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Meyers | first1 = M.| last2 = Lin | first2 = A.| last3 = Chen | first3 = P.| last4 = Muyco | first4 = J.| title = Mechanical strength of abalone nacre: role of the soft organic layer| journal = Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials| volume = 1| issue = 1| pages = 76–85| year = 2008| pmid = 19627773| doi = 10.1016/j.jmbbm.2007.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, many proteins are regulators in the mineralization process. They act in the [[nucleation]] or inhibition of hydroxyapatite formation. For example, the organic component in nacre is known to restrict the growth of aragonite. Some of the regulatory proteins in mineralized tissues are [[osteonectin]], [[osteopontin]], [[osteocalcin]], bone sialoprotein and [[dentin phosphoprotein|dentin phosphophoryn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biochemj.org/bj/317/0059/3170059.pdf |title=Nucleation and inhibition of hydroxyapatite formation by mineralized tissue proteins  |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In nacre, the organic component is porous, which allows the formation of mineral bridges responsible for the growth and order of the nacreous tablets.&lt;ref name="Meyers2008" /&gt;

==Formation of minerals==
Understanding the formation of biological tissues is inevitable in order to properly reconstruct them artificially. Even if questions remain in some aspects and the mechanism of mineralization of many mineralized tissues need yet to be determined, there are some ideas about those of mollusc shell, bone and sea urchin.&lt;ref name="Addadi2005" /&gt;

===Mollusk shell===
The main structural elements involved in the mollusk shell formation process are: a [[hydrophobic]] silk gel, aspartic acid rich protein, and a [[chitin]] support.
The silk gel is part of the protein portion and is mainly composed of [[glycine]] and [[alanine]]. It is not an ordered structure. The acidic proteins play a role in the configuration of the sheets. The [[chitin]] is highly ordered and is the framework of the matrix. The main elements of the overall are:&lt;ref name="Addadi2005" /&gt;
# The silk gel fills the matrix to be mineralized before the mineralization takes place.&lt;ref name="Addadi2005" /&gt;
# The highly ordered [[chitin]] determines the orientation of the crystals.&lt;ref name="Addadi2005" /&gt;
# The components of the matrix are spatially distinguishable.&lt;ref name="Addadi2005" /&gt;
# Amorphous [[calcium carbonate]] is the first form of the mineral.&lt;ref name="Addadi2005" /&gt;
# Once [[nucleation]] begins on the matrix, the calcium carbonate turns into crystals.&lt;ref name="Addadi2005" /&gt;
# While crystals grow, some of the acidic proteins get trapped within them.&lt;ref name="Addadi2005" /&gt;

===Bone===
In bone, mineralization starts from a [[heterogeneous]] solution having calcium and phosphate ions. The mineral nucleates, inside the hole area of the collagen fibrils, as thin layers of [[calcium phosphate]], which then grow to occupy the maximum space available there. The mechanisms of mineral deposition within the organic portion of the bone are still under investigation. Three possible suggestions are that nucleation is either due to the precipitation of calcium phosphate solution, caused by the removal of biological inhibitors or occurs because of the interaction of calcium-binding proteins.&lt;ref name="Fratzl1991" /&gt;

===Sea urchin embryo===
The [[sea urchin]] embryo has been used extensively in developmental biology studies. The larvae form a sophisticated [[endoskeleton]] that is made of two [[wikt:spicule|spicules]]. Each of the spicules is a single crystal of mineral [[calcite]]. The latter is a result of the transformation of amorphous CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to a more stable form. Therefore, there are two mineral phases in larval spicule formation.&lt;ref name='Beniash1997'&gt;{{Cite journal| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences| title = Amorphous calcium carbonate transforms into calcite during sea urchin larval spicule growth| volume = 264| pages = 461| doi = 10.1098/rspb.1997.0066| year = 1997| last1 = Beniash | first4 = S.| last2 = Aizenberg | first1 = E.| last4 = Weiner | first2 = J.| last3 = Addadi | first3 = L.| issue = 1380| pmc = 1688267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organic-inorganic interface==
The mineral-protein interface with its underlying adhesion forces is involved in the toughening properties of mineralized tissues. The interaction in the organic-inorganic interface is important to understand these toughening properties.&lt;ref name='Mohanty2007'&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Mohanty | first1 = B.| last2 = Katti | first2 = K.| last3 = Katti | first3 = D.| title = Experimental investigation of nanomechanics of the mineral-protein interface in nacre| journal = Mechanics Research Communications| volume = 35| pages = 17| year = 2008| doi = 10.1016/j.mechrescom.2007.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the interface, a very large force (&gt;6-5&amp;nbsp;nN) is needed to pull the protein molecules away from the [[aragonite]] mineral in nacre, despite the fact that the molecular interactions are non-bonded.&lt;ref name="Mohanty2007" /&gt; Some studies perform a [[finite element method|finite element model]] analysis to investigate the behaviour of the interface.&lt;ref name="FBarthelat2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name='Tang2007'&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 55| journal = Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids| pages = 1410| year = 2007| doi = 10.1016/j.jmps.2006.12.009| last1 = Tang| title = An elasto-viscoplastic interface model for investigating the constitutive behavior of nacre | first1 = H.| last2 = Barthelat | first2 = F. | first3 = H.| last3 = Espinosa| issue = 7|bibcode = 2007JMPSo..55.1410T }}&lt;/ref&gt; A model has shown that during tension, the back stress that is induced during the [[Plastic deformation in solids|plastic]] stretch of the material plays a big role in the hardening of the mineralized tissue. As well, the nanoscale [[Asperity (material science)|asperities]] that is on the tablet surfaces provide resistance to interlamellar sliding and so strengthen the material. A surface [[topology]] study has shown that progressive tablet locking and hardening, which are needed for spreading large [[deformation (engineering)|deformations]] over large volumes, occurred because of the waviness of the tablets.&lt;ref name="Tang2007" /&gt;

==Diseased mineralized tissues==
In [[vertebrates]], mineralized tissues not only develop through normal physiological processes, but can also be involved in [[pathology|pathological]]  processes. Some diseased areas that include the appearance of mineralized tissues include [[atherosclerotic]] plaques,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = J. D. | year = 2013 | title = Cardiovascular calcification: Orbicular origins | url = | journal = Nature Materials | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 476–478 | doi=10.1038/nmat3663 | pmid=23695741| bibcode = 2013NatMa..12..476M}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[tumoral calcinosis]], juvenile [[dermatomyositis]], [[kidney stone|kidney]] and [[sialolithiasis|salivary stones]]. All physiologic deposits contain the mineral [[hydroxyapatite]] or one analogous to it. Imaging techniques such as [[infrared spectroscopy]] are used to provide information on the type of mineral phase and changes in mineral and matrix composition involved in the disease.&lt;ref name="Boskey2005" /&gt; Also, clastic cells are cells that cause mineralized tissue [[Bone resorption|resorption]]. If there is an unbalance of clastic cell, this will disrupt resorptive activity and cause diseases. One of the studies involving mineralized tissues in dentistry is on the mineral phase of [[dentin]] in order to understand its alteration with aging. These alterations lead to “transparent” dentin, which is also called sclerotic. It was shown that a ‘‘dissolution and reprecipitation’’ mechanism reigns the formation of transparent dentin.&lt;ref name='APoreter2005'&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Porter | first1 = A.| last2 = Nalla | first2 = R.| last3 = Minor | first3 = A.| last4 = Jinschek | first4 = J.| last5 = Kisielowski | first5 = C.| last6 = Radmilovic | first6 = V.| last7 = Kinney | first7 = J.| last8 = Tomsia | first8 = A.| last9 = Ritchie | first9 = R.| title = A transmission electron microscopy study of mineralization in age-induced transparent dentin| journal = Biomaterials| volume = 26| issue = 36| pages = 7650–7660| year = 2005| pmid = 16005961| doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.05.059}}&lt;/ref&gt; The causes and cures of these conditions can possibly be found from further studies on the role of the mineralized tissues involved.

==Bioinspired materials==
The attractive properties of mineralized tissues like nacre and bone have led to the creation of a large number of [[biomimetic]] materials. Although improvements can be made, there are several techniques used to mimic these tissues. Some of the current techniques are described here for nacre imitation.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;

===Large scale “model materials”===
The large scale model of materials is based on the fact that crack deflection is an important [[Fracture toughening mechanisms|toughening mechanism]] of nacre. This deflection happens because of the weak interfaces between the [[aragonite]] tiles. Systems on the [[macroscopic]] scales are used to imitate these week interfaces with layered composite ceramic tablets that are held together by weak interface “glue”. Hence, these large scale models can overcome the brittleness of ceramics. Since other mechanisms like tablet locking and damage spreading also play a role in the toughness of nacre, other models assemblies inspired by the waviness of microstructure of nacre have also been devised on the large scale.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;

===Ice templation===
Ice Templation is a new method that uses the physics of ice formation to develop a layered-hybrid material. In this system, ceramic particles in a concentrated suspension are frozen using carefully controlled freezing kinetics. As a result, a homogeneous, porous [[scaffold]] can be made, which is then filled with a second organic or inorganic phase to build dense layered composites.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;

===Layer-by-layer deposition===
Layer-by-layer deposition is a technique that as suggested by its name consists of a layer-by-layer assembly to make multilayered composites like nacre. Some examples of efforts in this direction include alternating layers of hard and soft components of TiN/Pt with an [[ion beam]] system. The [[Composite material|composites]] made by this sequential deposition technique do not have a segmented layered microstructure. Thus, sequential adsorption has been proposed to overcome this limitation and consists of repeatedly adsorbing [[electrolytes]] and rinsing the tablets, which results in multilayers.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;

===Thin film deposition: microfabricated structures===
Thin film deposition focuses on reproducing the cross-lamellar microstructure of conch instead of mimicking the layered structure of nacre using [[microelectromechanical systems|micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS)]]. Among mollusk shells, the [[conch]] shell has the highest degree of structural organization.  The mineral [[aragonite]] and organic matrix are replaced by [[crystalline silicon|polysilicon]] and [[photoresist]]. The MEMS technology repeatedly deposits a thin silicon film. The interfaces are [[etching (microfabrication)|etched]] by reactive ion etching and then filled with [[photoresist]]. There are three films deposited consecutively.  Although the MEMS technology is expensive and more time consuming, there is a high degree of control over the morphology and large numbers of specimens can be made.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;

===Self-assembly===
The method of self-assembly tries to reproduce not only the properties, but also the processing of [[bioceramics]]. In this process, raw materials readily available in nature are used to achieve stringent control of nucleation and growth. This [[nucleation]] occurs on a synthetic surface with some success. The technique occurs at low temperature and in an aqueous environment.  Self-assembling films form templates that effect the nucleation of ceramic phases. The downside with this technique is its inability to form a segmented layered microstructure. Segmentation is an important property of nacre used for crack deflection of the ceramic phase without fracturing it. As a consequence, this technique does not mimic microstructural characteristics of nacre beyond the layered organic/inorganic layered structure and requires further investigation.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;

==The future==
The various studies have increased progress towards understanding mineralized tissues. However, it is still unclear which micro/nanostructural features are essential to the material performance of these tissues. Also constitutive laws along various loading paths of the materials are currently unavailable. For nacre, the role of some nanograins and mineral bridges requires further studies to be fully defined. Successful biomimicking of mollusk shells will depend will on gaining further knowledge of all these factors, especially the selection of influential materials in the performance of mineralized tissues. Also the final technique used for artificial reproduction must be both cost effective and scalable industrially.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;

'''Modern sculpture''' is generally considered to have begun with the work of [[Auguste Rodin]], who is seen as the progenitor of modern [[sculpture]]. While Rodin did not set out to rebel against the past, he created a new way of building his works.&lt;ref&gt;Elsen, Albert E. (2003). ''Rodin's Art: The Rodin Collection of the Iris &amp; Gerald B. Cantor Center for the Visual Arts''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513381-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.psmuseum.org/exhibitions/upcoming_exhibition_new.php Rodin to Now: Modern Sculpture]", Palm Springs Desert Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; He "dissolved the hard outline of contemporary Neo-Greek academicism, and thereby created a vital synthesis of opacity and transparency, volume and void".&lt;ref&gt;Giedion-Welcker, Carola, ‘’Contemporary Sculpture: An Evolution in Volume and Space, A revised and Enlarged Edition’’, Faber and Faber, London, 1961, p. X&lt;/ref&gt; Along with a few other artists in the late 19th century who experimented with new artistic visions in sculpture like [[Edgar Degas]] and [[Paul Gauguin]], Rodin invented a radical new approach in the creation of sculpture. Modern sculpture, along with all modern art, "arose as part of Western society's attempt to come to terms with the urban, industrial and secular society that emerged during the nineteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, Robert, ‘’ARTSPOKE: A Guide to Modern Ideas, Movements and Buzzwords, 1848-1944’’ Abbeville Publishers, New York, 1993, p.140&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern sculpture movement can be said to begin at the [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] exhibit at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Universal Exhibition]] held in [[Paris, France|Paris]] in 1900. At this event Rodin showed his [[Burghers of Calais]], [[Balzac]], [[Victor Hugo]] statues, and the exhibition included the first public showing of his [[Gates of Hell]] which included [[The Thinker]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Penelope, ‘’Sculpture: 1900-1945’’, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1999, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elsen, Albert L., ‘’Rodin’s Gates of Hell’’, University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, MN, 1960 p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cubist sculpture]], in the early 20th century, was a style that developed in parallel with [[Cubism|cubist painting]], and the formal experiments of [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]. Beginning around 1909 and evolving through the early 1920s cubist artists developed new means of constructing works of art using [[collage]], sculptural assemblage using disparate materials and traditional sculpture making from plaster and clay molds. Some sources name Picasso's 1909 bronze ''Head of a Woman'' as the first cubist sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Glueck, "[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/26/arts/art-view-picasso-revolutionized-sculpture-too.html Picasso Revolutionized Sculpture Too]", ''New York Times'', exhibition review 1982, Retrieved July 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists like [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] (1876-1918), whose career was cut short by his death in military service, and [[Alexander Archipenko]], who'd arrived in Paris in 1908 and whose 1912 ''Walking Woman'' were very quick to follow Braque and Picasso's lead.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kodnergallery.com/gallery/modernism/bios/archipenkobio.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Csaky]], a sculptor from Hungary, exhibited his first cubist sculptures in Paris in 1911. [[Duchamp-Villon]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Henri Laurens]] and [[Ossip Zadkine]] and others joined the earlier cubist sculptors.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rosenblum, "Cubism", ''Readings in Art History 2'' (1976), Seuphor, Sculpture of this Century&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edith Balas, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rUPz18-QeyEC&amp;q=csaky#v=onepage&amp;q=csaky&amp;f=false Joseph Csaky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture]'', American Philosophical Society, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, during his period of cubist innovation, [[Pablo Picasso]] revolutionized the art of sculpture when he began creating his ''constructions'' fashioned by combining disparate objects and materials into one constructed piece of sculpture; Picasso reinvented the art of sculpture with his innovative use of constructing a work in three dimensions with disparate material, the sculptural equivalent of the [[collage]] in two-dimensional art. Just as collage was a radical development in two-dimensional art; so was ''construction'' a radical development in three-dimensional sculpture. The advent of [[Surrealism]] led to things occasionally being described as "sculpture" that would not have been so previously, such as "involuntary sculpture" in several senses, including [[coulage]]. In later years Picasso became a prolific [[pottery|potter]], leading, with interest in historic pottery from around the world, to a revival of  [[ceramic art]], with figures such as [[George E. Ohr]] and subsequently [[Peter Voulkos]], [[Kenneth Price]], and [[Robert Arneson]]. [[Marcel Duchamp]] originated the use of the "[[found object]]" (French: ''objet trouvé'') or ''readymade'' with pieces such as [[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]] (1917).

Similarly, the work of [[Constantin Brâncuși]] at the beginning of the century paved the way for later abstract sculpture. In revolt against the naturalism of Rodin and his late 19th-century contemporaries, Brâncuși distilled subjects down to their essences as illustrated by the elegantly refined forms of his ''[[Bird in Space]]'' series (1924). These elegantly refined forms became synonymous with 20th-century sculpture.&lt;ref name=edward&gt;Edward Lucie-Smith, ''Visual arts in the 20th century'', Edition illustrated, Publisher Harry N. Abrams, 1997, Original from the University of Michigan, {{ISBN|0-8109-3934-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8109-3934-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, Brâncuși won a lawsuit against the U.S. customs authorities who attempted to value his sculpture as raw metal. The suit led to legal changes permitting the importation of abstract art free of duty.&lt;ref&gt;"Constantin Brâncuși", ''Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition, 2008 http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Constantin_Brancusi.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Brâncuși's impact, with his vocabulary of reduction and abstraction, is seen throughout the 1930s and 1940s, and exemplified by artists such as [[Gaston Lachaise]], [[Sir Jacob Epstein]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Ásmundur Sveinsson]], [[Julio González (sculptor)|Julio González]], [[Pablo Serrano]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]]&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford dictionary of American art and artists, Author Ann Lee Morgan, Publisher Oxford University Press, 2007,Original from the University of Michigan,{{ISBN|0-19-512878-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-512878-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also by the 1940s abstract sculpture was impacted and expanded by [[Alexander Calder]], [[Len Lye]], [[Jean Tinguely]], and [[Frederick Kiesler]] who were pioneers of [[Kinetic art]].

==Post-1950s==
Since the 1950s [[Modernist]] trends in sculpture both abstract and figurative have dominated the public imagination and the popularity of Modernist sculpture had sidelined the traditional approach. [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] was commissioned to make a [[maquette]] for a huge, {{convert|50|ft|m|sing=on}}-high [[public art|public sculpture]] to be built in [[Chicago]], known usually as the ''[[Chicago Picasso]]''. He approached the project with a great deal of enthusiasm, designing a sculpture which was ambiguous and somewhat controversial. What the figure represents is not known; it could be a bird, a horse, a woman, or a totally abstract shape. The sculpture, one of the most recognizable landmarks in downtown Chicago, was unveiled in 1967. Picasso refused to be paid $100,000 for it, donating it to the people of the city.

In the late 1950s and the 1960s, abstract sculptors began experimenting with a wide array of new materials and different approaches to creating their work. Surrealist imagery, anthropomorphic abstraction, new materials and combinations of new energy sources and varied surfaces and objects became characteristic of much new modernist sculpture. Collaborative projects with landscape designers, architects, and landscape architects expanded the outdoor site and contextual integration. Artists such as [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Jean Tinguely]], [[Richard Lippold]], [[George Rickey]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], and [[Louise Nevelson]] came to characterize the look of modern sculpture.

By the 1960s [[Abstract expressionism]], [[Geometric abstraction]] and [[Minimalism]], which reduces sculpture to its most essential and fundamental features,  predominated. Some works of the period are: the Cubi works of David Smith, and the welded steel works of [[Sir Anthony Caro]], as well as [[welded sculpture]] by a large variety of sculptors, the large scale work of [[John Angus Chamberlain|John Chamberlain]], and environmental installation scale works by [[Mark di Suvero]]. Other Minimalists and [[Postminimalist]]s include [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Anne Truitt]], [[Ronald Bladen]], [[Giacomo Benevelli]], [[Arnaldo Pomodoro]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Christo]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[Robert Smithson]], and others like [[John Safer]] who added motion and monumentality to the theme of purity of line.&lt;ref&gt;National Air and Space Museum Receives "Ascent" Sculpture for display at Udvar-Hazy Center [http://www.nasm.si.edu/events/pressroomreleaseDetail.cfm?releaseID=49]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; led contemporary abstract sculpture in new directions. During the 1960s and 1970s figurative sculpture by pop artists and modernist artists in stylized forms by artists such as: [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Arman]], [[Leonard Baskin]], [[Ernest Trova]], [[Marisol Escobar]], [[Paul Thek]], [[Manuel Neri]] and others became popular. In the 1980s several artists, among others, exploring figurative sculpture were [[Robert Graham (sculptor)|Robert Graham]] in a classic articulated style and [[Fernando Botero]] bringing his painting's "oversized figures" into monumental sculptures. [[Ceramic art|Ceramic]] sculpture as practiced by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Peter Voulkos]], [[Stephen De Staebler]], [[Kenneth Price]], and others became an important idiom of modern sculpture in the 20th century.

===Contemporary movements===

Artists created [[environmental sculpture]] on expansive sites in the "[[Land Arts of the American West|land art in the American West]]" group of projects. These [[land art]] or "earth art" environmental scale sculpture works exemplified by artists such as [[Robert Smithson]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[James Turrell]] ([[Roden Crater]]). [[Eva Hesse]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Jackie Winsor]], [[Keith Sonnier]], and [[Bruce Nauman]], among others were pioneers of [[Postminimalist]] sculpture.

Also during the 1960s and 1970s artists as diverse as [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], [[Chryssa]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Edward Kienholz]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Duane Hanson]], and [[John DeAndrea]] explored abstraction, imagery, and figuration through [[video art]], environment, light sculpture, and [[installation art]] in new ways.

[[Conceptual art]] is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns. Works include ''[[One and Three Chairs]]'', 1965, by [[Joseph Kosuth]], and ''[[An Oak Tree]]'', 1973, by [[Michael Craig-Martin]], and those of [[Joseph Beuys]] and [[James Turrell]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/craig-martin-an-oak-tree-l02262 Tate]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Postmodern art|Postmodern sculpture]] occupies a broader field of activities than Modernist sculpture. [[Rosalind Krauss]] identified sculpture in the expanded field, a series of oppositions around the work's relationship to its environment that describe the various sculpture-like activities that are postmodern sculpture, creating a theoretical explanation that could adequately fit the developments of [[Land art]], [[Minimalism|Minimalist sculpture]], and [[site-specific art]] into the category of "sculpture":

* Site-Construction: the intersection of landscape and architecture 
* Axiomatic Structures: the combination of architecture and not-architecture
* Marked sites: the combination of landscape and not-landscape
* Sculpture: intersection of not-landscape and not-architecture

====Contemporary genres====
Modern sculpture is often created outdoors, as in [[environmental art]] and [[environmental sculpture]], often in full view of spectators. [[Light sculpture]] and [[site-specific art]] also often make use of the environment. Site-specific [[work of art|artwork]] is intentionally created for a specific place. The term was first used in the mid-1970s by sculptors [[Patricia Johanson]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Athena Tacha]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Frank, "Site Sculpture", ''Art News'', Oct. 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Site specific environmental art was described as a movement by architectural critic Catherine Howett&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Howett, ''New Directions in Environmental Art,'' Landscape Architecture, Jan. 1977&lt;/ref&gt; and [[art critic]] [[Lucy Lippard]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Lippard, ''Art Outdoors, In and Out of the Public Domain,'' Studio International, March–April 1977&lt;/ref&gt; [[Land art]], [[Earthworks (art)|Earthworks]], ([[Earth art]]) is an [[art movement]] that makes specific use of the real landscape to form works of sculpture that are located in and make use of [[nature]] generally in altered form. It is a form of sculpture created in nature, from nature, using materials found in nature like dirt, [[soil]], [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], logs, branches, [[leaf|leaves]], and [[water]], as well as man made materials like [[Chain-link fencing]], [[barbed wire]], [[rope]], [[rubber]], [[glass]], [[concrete]], [[metal]], [[asphalt]], and mineral [[pigments]]. [[Ice sculpture]] is a form of ephemeral sculpture that uses ice as the raw material. It is popular in China, Japan, Canada, Sweden, and Russia. Ice sculptures feature decoratively in some cuisines, especially in Asia. [[Kinetic sculpture]]s are sculptures that are designed to move, which include [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobiles]]. [[Snow sculpture]]s are usually carved out of a single block of snow about 6 to {{convert|15|ft|m}} on each side and weighing about 20–30 tons. The snow is densely packed into a form after having been produced by artificial means or collected from the ground after a snowfall.

[[Sound sculpture]]s take the form of indoor sound installations, outdoor installations such as [[aeolian harp]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, automatons, or be more or less near conventional musical instruments. Sound sculpture is often site-specific. [[Art toys]] have become another format for contemporary artists since the late 1990s, such as those produced by [[Takashi Murakami]] and [[Kid Robot]], designed by [[Michael Lau]], or hand-made by [[Michael Leavitt (artist)|Michael Leavitt]].&lt;ref&gt;"Art Army by Michael Leavitt", '' hypediss.com'' [http://www.hypediss.com/art_army_by_michael_leavitt], December 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3747">{{merge to|Dose–response relationship|date=October 2017}}
In statistics, in particular in the [[design of experiments]], a '''multi-valued treatment''' is a treatment that can take on more than two values. It is related to the [[Dose–response relationship|dose-response model]] in the medical literature. Generally speaking, treatment levels may be finite or infinite as well as ordinal or cardinal, which leads to a large collection of possible treatment effects to be studied in applications.&lt;ref&gt;Cattaneo, M. D. (2010): Multi-valued Treatment Effects. Encyclopedia of Research Design, ed. By N. J. Salkind, Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the effect of different levels of program participation (e.g. full-time and part-time) in a job training program.&lt;ref&gt;Wooldridge, J. (2002): Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assume there exists a finite collection of multi-valued treatment status &lt;math&gt;T=\{0,1,2,\ldots,J,\}&lt;/math&gt; with J some fixed integer. As in the potential outcomes framework, denote  &lt;math&gt;Y (j) \subset R&lt;/math&gt; the collection of potential outcomes under the treatment ''J'', and &lt;math&gt;Y=\textstyle \sum_{j=0}^J \displaystyle D_j Y(j)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the observed outcome and &lt;math&gt;D_{j}&lt;/math&gt; is an indicator that equals '''1''' when the treatment equals ''j'' and '''0''' when it does not equal '''''j''''', leading to a fundamental problem of causal inference.&lt;ref&gt;Cattaneo, M. D. (2010): Efficient Semiparametric Estimation of Multi-Valued Treatment Effects under Ignorability. Journal of Econometrics 155(2), pp. 138–154.&lt;/ref&gt;  A general framework that analyzes ordered choice models in terms of marginal treatment effects and average treatment effects has been extensively discussed by Heckman and Vytlacil.&lt;ref&gt;Heckman, J. J., and E. J. Vytlacil (2007): Econometric Evaluation of Social Programs, Part II: Using the Marginal Treatment Effect to Organize Alternative Econometric Estimators to Evaluate Social Programs, and to Forecast the Effects in New Environments. Handbook of Econometrics, Vol 6, ed. by J. J. Heckman and E. E. Leamer. North Holland.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent work in the econometrics and statistics literature has focused on estimation and inference for multivalued treatments and ignorability conditions for identifying the treatment effects. In the context of program evaluation, the propensity score has been generalized to allow for multi-valued treatments,&lt;ref&gt;Imbens, G. (2000): The Role of the Propensity Score in Estimating Dose-Response Functions. Biometrika 87(3), pp. 706–710.&lt;/ref&gt; while other work has also focused on the role of the conditional mean independence assumption.&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, M. (2001): Identification and Estimation of Causal Effects of Multiple Treatments under the Conditional Independence Assumption. Econometric Evaluation of Labour Market Policies, ed. by M. Lechner and F. Pfeiffer, pp. 43–58. Physica/Springer, Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other recent work has focused more on the large sample properties of an estimator of the marginal mean treatment effect conditional on a treatment level in the context of a difference-in-differences model,&lt;ref&gt;Abadie, A. (2005): Semiparametric Difference-in-Differences Estimators. Review of Economic Studies 72(1), pp. 1–19.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the efficient estimation of multi-valued treatment effects in a semiparametric framework.&lt;ref&gt;Cattaneo, M. D. (2010): Efficient Semiparametric Estimation of Multi-Valued Treatment Effects under Ignorability. Journal of Econometrics 155(2), pp. 138–154&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3352">"'''Nature Farming'''" was established in 1936 by [[Mokichi Okada]], the founder of the [[Church of World Messianity]], an agricultural system originally called "no fertilizer farming" or {{nihongo|[[:ja:自然農法|自然農法]]|shizen nōhō}} in Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainable Agriculture: Definition and Terms. Special Reference Briefs Series no. SRB 99-02, September 1999. Compiled by: Mary V. Gold, Alternative Farming Systems Information Center, U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt;

Offshoots such as the Sekai Kyusei Kyo, promoting ‘Kyusei nature farming’, and the Mokichi Okada Association formed after his death to continue promoting the work in Japan and South-East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Setboonsarng, S. and Gilman, J. 1999. Alternative Agriculture in Thailand and Japan. HORIZON Communications, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/ref&gt;

ZZ2, a farming conglomerate in South Africa has translated the term to [[Afrikaans]], "Natuurboerdery".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Silent|first=Taurayi,|title=An investigation of natuurboerdery (natural farming) approach : a ZZ2 case study|date=March 2011|publisher=Stellenbosch : University of Stellenbosch|url=http://scholar.sun.ac.za/handle/10019.1/6694|language=en-ZA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the International Nature Farming Research Center in [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]], Japan,&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Proof of Mokichi Okada's Nature Farming Theories by Xu, Hui-lian. Agricultural Experiment Station, International Nature Farming Research Center, Nagano&lt;/ref&gt; it is based on the theories that:
* [[Fertilizer]]s pollute the soil and weaken its power of production.
* [[Pest (organism)|Pests]] would break out from the excessive use of fertilizers
* The difference in disease incidence between resistant and susceptible plants is attributed to nutritional conditions inside the body.
* Vegetables and fruits produced by nature farming taste better than those by [[Industrial agriculture|chemical farming]].
The term is sometimes used for an alternative farming philosophy of [[Masanobu Fukuoka]].

Another Japanese farmer and philosopher, [[Masanobu Fukuoka]], conceived of an alternative farming system in the 1930s separately from Okada and used the same Japanese characters to describe it.&lt;ref name="NATURE FARMING-Xu1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Xu|first=Hui-Lian|title=NATURE FARMING In Japan|url=http://www.ressign.com/UserBookDetail.aspx?bkid=460&amp;catid=140|accessdate=6 March 2011|type=Monograph|year=2001|publisher=Research Signpost|location=T.

Nelson Mandela University was founded through a merger of three institutions in January 2005, but its history dates back to 1882, with the foundation of the Port Elizabeth Art School. The University draws international students from all over the world. There are over 3,000 international students, including students from the United States, France, China, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom and many African countries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Nelson Mandela University is a comprehensive university offering professional and [[vocational]] training. The University has seven campuses – six in [[Port Elizabeth, South Africa|Port Elizabeth]] and one in [[George, Western Cape|George]]. The main campus of the university is South Campus. Students at Nelson Mandela University can study towards a [[diploma]] or a [[academic degree|degree]] up to [[doctoral]] level qualifications. A number of courses include workplace experience as part of the curriculum at Nelson Mandela University. English is the university's medium of instruction.

==History and formation==
{{Main article|University of Port Elizabeth|Vista University}}
Plans for the then NMMU where first revealed in 2002, by then [[Minister of Education (South Africa)|Minister of Education]], [[Kader Asmal]]. The proposal was a part of larger plan to restructure higher education in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/shake-up-in-south-africa-gets-green-light/169757.article|title=Shake-up in South Africa gets green light|date=14 June 2002|publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first step in the merger came with the incorporation of Vista PE by UPE on January 2, 2004 followed by the merger of PE Technikon and UPE on January 1, 2005.

NMMU was formed in 2005 through the merger of the Port Elizabeth Technikon, and the [[University of Port Elizabeth]].&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; In 2004, prior to the merger, UPE had taken control of the [[Port Elizabeth]] Campus of [[Vista University]]. PE Technikon had a satellite campus in [[George, Western Cape|George]], which was also merged. The first Chancellor of the university was Chief Justice Pius Langa and Justice Ronnie Pillay was the first Chairperson of Council. Dr Rolf Stumpf was the first Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive Officer of the university, who was then succeeded by Professor Derrick Swartz on January 1, 2008.

The name of the University was formally changed from Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University to Nelson Mandela University on 20 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/education/2017-07-10-nelson-mandela-metropolitan-university-to-rebrand-itself/|title=Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University to rebrand itself|date=10 July 2017|publisher=Business Day|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PE Technikon logo.svg|right|thumb|150px|PE Technikon logo]]

===PE Technikon===
PE Technikon had its roots in the Port Elizabeth Art School, which was founded in 1882 and was the oldest art school in South Africa, and was situated in Russell Road, Central. It was later renamed the College for Advanced Technical Education (CATE). The college moved to University Way in Summerstrand in 1974, and became PE technikon in 1979.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; The Port Elizabeth Teachers' Training College was located in 2nd Avenue, Summerstrand. It was taken over by PE Technikon in 1994, and became known as the College Campus.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

[[Saasveld Forestry College]] was founded as the Tokai School for Forest Apprentices in 1912 in [[Cape Town]]. The school was an offshoot of the [[South African College Schools]]. In 1932, it moved to its current location, between [[George, Western Cape|George]] and [[Knysna]]. The campus was taken over by PE Technikon from the Department of Agriculture in 1985.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

The Algoa College of Education was situated in Struandale, approximately {{convert|25|km|mi}} away from Summerstrand. It became part of the PE Technikon in 2001, and was known as the Algoa Campus.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; In 2001, the George Campus was added to by purchasing Hurteria Building in the city centre.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

At the time of the merger, PE Technikon had more than 10 000 students. The institution's last Chancellor was former Speaker of Parliament Dr Frene Ginwala, the last Vice-Chancellor Prof Hennie Snyman and the last Chair of Council being Mr Clive Stanton.

===University of Port Elizabeth (UPE)===
UPE was the country's first dual-medium (English and [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]) residential university. 
It came into being on January 31, with the adoption by Parliament of Act 1 of 1964. The first academic year commenced on March 1, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/university-port-elizabeth-founded|title=The University of Port Elizabeth is founded|date=|publisher=South African History Online|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially situated in a series of buildings on Bird Street, in the historic Central district, UPE moved to a modern, purpose-built campus – incorporating residences, a sports complex and the towering Main Building – in Summerstrand in 1974. The campus was officially opened in August 1975 and the final move from Bird Street came in 1979 with the opening of the science blocks at Summerstrand. The University retained some of its Bird Street buildings and these became the centre of community outreach activities.

Built on 830 ha of land donated by the then Port Elizabeth City Council, the campus was declared a nature reserve in 1983.

At the time of the merger, UPE had more than 9 000 contact students and almost 5 000 distance education students. The last Chancellor was Dr Brigalia Bam, the last Vice-Chancellor Prof Nthabiseng Ogude and the last Chair of Council Mr Trevor Jennings.

===Vista University (Vista PE)===
Vista was founded on 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessday.co.za/Articles/TarkArticle.aspx?ID=236618|title=News Worth Knowing|date=|publisher=Business Day|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Port Elizabeth campus was built in 1982. Subsequently, seven decentralized contact tuition campuses were established, centred on township areas where the need for accessible and affordable higher education was most urgent. In 1982 the Port Elizabeth campus consisted of a small, prefabricated building patched between the national road to Uitenhage and the edge of Zwide township. Its location opened up access to higher education for many students from socially and financially disadvantaged backgrounds.

The campus had its first academic year in 1983 and in 1991 a permanent brick structure was completed. Later additions such as the Conference Hall and Arena provided accessible facilities for the surrounding community for large events. With seating for 5 000, the Arena is the Eastern Cape’s largest indoor venue.

Initially focused on the upgrading of teachers through its Education Faculty, in its subsequent growth Vista far surpassed the narrow field of expertise cut out for it, producing graduates in business, law, science and the humanities.

At the time of the merger, Vista PE had approximately 2 000 students and was led by Acting Campus Principal Prof Miemie Struwig.
with its first academic year in 1983. It was taken over by UPE.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

==Governance and administration==
The [[figurehead|ceremonial head]] of the university is the Chancellor, who, in the name of the university, confers all qualifications. The Vice-Chancellor is responsible for the day-to-day running of the university. Deputy Vice-Chancellors for Research and Engagement, Teaching and Learning, Institutional Support as well as the Registrar, acting as the Secretary to the University's Council, assist the Vice-Chancellor in his duties.

A '''nickel sulfide inclusion''', (also abbreviated to NiS), occurs during the process of manufacturing [[float glass]] (normal window glass).

==Occurrence==
In a batch of [[glass]], contaminants that contain [[nickel]] might be present, (e.g. [[stainless steel]].) 
These can combine with [[sulfur]] to form [[nickel sulfide]] inclusions. [[Furnaces]] produce hundreds of tons of glass every day, so it is difficult to completely eliminate any contaminants. This causes a problem later in the manufacturing process.&lt;ref name="NiS and spontaneous breakage"&gt;[http://www.glassonweb.com/articles/article/96/ NiS and spontaneous breakage]&lt;/ref&gt;

While total elimination is difficult, specific controlled processes can significantly reduce the formation of NiS in the float glass.  These are actions taken by US flat glass manufacturers supplying to the automotive industry in the early 1990s:
a) all green sand (silica, transported by railroads from Wyoming USA) shipments were processed through multiple screens (to filter out any nickel bearing materials either mineral or stainless steel tools, nuts, bolts, washers) since stainless steel cannot be detected by magnets.
b) all other bulk materials including recycled glass were inspected similarly to (a).
c) every maintenance procedure and all training was very focused on the need for every worker to prevent contamination of the float furnace or the float glass tank with NiS.
d) use of any nickel containing tool or material anywhere in the Ford Glass float facility was closely controlled to prevent contamination.
e) any float glass suspected to have NiS (it could only be found with a Scanning Electron Microscope) was destroyed and landfilled as it could not be re-introduced to glass used for any purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Experience of Ronald A. Hayes while Purchasing Facilitator at AP Technoglass in Elizabethtown Kentucky from 1989 to 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of tempering [[float glass]] can cause a NiS to change from its normal state (known as a low-temperature structure) to a different high-temperature, [[crystalline structure]]. When the [[glass]] is cooled quickly (as part of the process) the NiS particle is unable to change back to its original form. 
Over a certain period of time NiS will slowly convert to the original low temperature structure. This means the NiS increases in size, and the [[mechanical stress]]es caused by this cause the tempered pane to shatter, for no apparent reason (hence [[spontaneous glass breakage]]).&lt;ref name="NiS and spontaneous breakage"/&gt;

In [[astronomy]], the '''Ostriker–Peebles criterion''', named after its discoverers [[Jeremiah Ostriker]] and [[Jim Peebles]], describes the formation of barred [[galaxy|galaxies]].&lt;ref name=gd-pup&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=01yNf7mipb0C&amp;lpg=PA374&amp;ots=p8wf-UJBte&amp;dq=Ostriker-Peebles%20criterion&amp;pg=PA374#v=onepage&amp;q=Ostriker-Peebles%20criterion&amp;f=false |title=Galactic Dynamics |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |access-date=2 September 2016 |date=1987 |first1=James |last1=Binney |first2=Scott |last2=Tremaine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rotating disc of a spiral galaxy, consisting of stars and solar systems, may become unstable in a way that the stars in the outer parts of the "arms" are released from the galaxy system, resulting in the collapse of the remaining stars into a bar-shaped galaxy. This occurs in approximately 1/3 of the known spiral galaxies.

Based on the first kinetic energy component ''T'' and the total gravitational energy ''W'', a galaxy will become barred when &lt;math&gt;\frac{T}{W} &gt; 0.15&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=gd-pup/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23023">In astronomy a '''phase curve''' describes the brightness of a reflecting body as a function of its [[Phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]]. The brightness usually refers the object's [[absolute magnitude]], which, in turn, is its [[apparent magnitude]] at a distance of one [[astronomical unit]] from the Earth and Sun. The [[Phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]] equals the arc subtended by the observer and the sun as measured at the body.

The phase curve is useful for characterizing an object's [[regolith]] (soil) and atmosphere. It is also the basis for computing the [[geometrical albedo]] and the [[Bond albedo]] of the body. In [[ephemeris]] generation, the phase curve is used in conjunction with the distances from the object to the Sun and the Earth to calculate the apparent magnitude.

==Mercury==

[[File:Mercury Phase Curve.jpg|thumb|The phase curve of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and its opposition surge.&lt;ref name="MallamaMercury"/&gt;]]

The phase curve of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] is very steep, which is characteristic of a body on which bare [[regolith]] (soil) is exposed to view. At phase angles exceeding 90° ([[crescent]] phase) the brightness falls off especially sharply. The shape of the phase curve indicates a mean slope on the surface of Mercury of about 16°,&lt;ref name="MallamaMercury"/&gt; which is slightly smoother than that of the [[Moon]]. Approaching phase angle 0° (fully illuminated phase) the curve rises to a sharp peak. This surge in brightness is called the [[opposition effect]]&lt;ref Name="Shkuratov"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Helfenstein"/&gt; because for most bodies (though not Mercury) it occurs at astronomical opposition when the body is opposite from the Sun in the sky. The width of the opposition surge for Mercury indicates that both the compaction state of the regolith and the distribution of particle sizes on the planet are similar to those on the Moon.&lt;ref name="MallamaMercury"/&gt;

Early visual observations contributing to the phase curve of Mercury were obtained by G. Muller&lt;ref name="Muller"/&gt; in the 1800s and by [[André-Louis Danjon]]&lt;ref name="Danjon1949"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Danjon1950"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Danjon1953"/&gt; in the mid-twentieth century. W. Irvine and colleagues&lt;ref name="IrvineIII"/&gt; used photoelectric photometry in the 1960s. Some of these early data were analyzed by G. de Vaucouleurs,&lt;ref name="deVaucouleurs1964"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deVaucouleurs1970"/&gt; summarized by D. Harris&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; and used for predicting apparent magnitudes in the [[Astronomical Almanac]]&lt;ref name="Hilton1992"/&gt; for several decades. Highly accurate new observations covering the widest range of phase angles to date (2 to 170°) were carried out by A. Mallama, D. Wang and R. Howard&lt;ref name="MallamaMercury"/&gt; using the [[LASCO Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph|Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronograph (LASCO)]] on the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)]] satellite. They also obtained new CCD observations from the ground. These data are now the major source of the phase curve used in the [[Astronomical Almanac]]&lt;ref name="Hilton2005"/&gt; for predicting apparent magnitudes.

The apparent brightness of Mercury as seen from Earth is greatest at phase angle 0° ([[conjunction (astronomy and astrology)#Superior and inferior|superior conjunction]] with the Sun) when it can reach magnitude −2.6.&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt; At phase angles approaching 180° ([[conjunction (astronomy and astrology)#Superior and inferior|inferior conjunction]]) the planet fades to about magnitude +5&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt; with the exact brightness depending on the phase angle at that particular [[conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]]. This difference of more than 7 magnitudes corresponds to a change of over a thousand times in apparent brightness.

==Venus==

[[File:Venus Phase Curve.jpg|thumb|The phase curve of Venus&lt;ref name="MallamaVenus"/&gt; compared to Mercury,&lt;ref name="MallamaMercury"/&gt; and the brightness excess of Venus.]]

The relatively flat phase curve of [[Venus]] is characteristic of a cloudy planet.&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt; In contrast to Mercury where the curve is strongly peaked approaching phase angle zero (full phase) that of Venus is rounded. The wide illumination scattering angle of clouds, as opposed to the narrower scattering of regolith, causes this flattening of the phase curve. Venus exhibits a brightness surge near phase angle 170°, when it is a thin [[crescent]], due to forward scattering of sunlight by droplets of [[sulfuric acid]] that are above the planet's cloud tops.&lt;ref name="MallamaVenus"/&gt; Even beyond 170° the brightness does not decline very steeply.

The history of observation and analysis of the phase curve of Venus is similar to that of Mercury. The best set of modern observations and interpretation was reported by A. Mallama, D. Wang and R. Howard.&lt;ref name="MallamaVenus" /&gt; They used the [[LASCO Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph|LASCO]] instrument on [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] and ground-based, CCD equipment to observe the phase curve from 2 to 179°. As with Mercury, these new data are the major source of the phase curve used in the [[Astronomical Almanac]]&lt;ref name="Hilton2005"/&gt; for predicting apparent magnitudes.

In contrast to Mercury the maximal apparent brightness of Venus as seen from Earth does not occur at phase angle zero. Since the phase curve of Venus is relatively flat while its distance from the Earth can vary greatly, maximum brightness occurs when the planet is a crescent, at phase angle 125°, at which time Venus can be as bright as magnitude −4.9.&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt; Near [[conjunction (astronomy and astrology)#Superior and inferior|inferior conjunction]] the planet typically fades to about magnitude −3&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt; although the exact value depends on the phase angle. The typical range in apparent brightness for Venus over the course of one apparition is less than a factor of 10 or merely 1% that of Mercury.

==Earth==

The phase curve of the [[Earth]] has not been determined as accurately as those for Mercury and Venus because its integrated brightness is difficult to measure from the surface. Instead of direct observation, [[earthshine]] reflected from the portion of the Moon not lit by the Sun has served as a proxy. A few direct measurements of the Earth's luminosity have been obtained with the [[EPOXI]] spacecraft. While they do not cover much of the phase curve they reveal a rotational light curve caused by the transit of dark oceans and bright land masses across the hemisphere. P. Goode and colleagues at [[Big Bear Solar Observatory]] have measured the earthshine&lt;ref Name="Goode"/&gt; and T. Livengood of NASA analyzed the EPOXI data.&lt;ref Name="Livengood"/&gt;

Earth as seen from Venus near opposition from the Sun would be extremely bright at magnitude −6. To an observer outside the Earth's orbit on Mars our planet would appear most luminous near the time of its greatest elongation from the Sun, at about magnitude −1.5.

==Mars==

[[File:Mars phase curve.jpg|thumb|The phase curve of Mars&lt;ref name="MallamaMars"/&gt; compared to Mercury.&lt;ref name="MallamaMercury"/&gt;]]

Only about 50° of the martian phase curve can be observed from Earth because it orbits farther from the Sun than our planet. There is an opposition surge but it is less pronounced than that of Mercury. The rotation of bright and dark surface markings across its disk and variability of its atmospheric state (including its dust storms) superimpose variations on the phase curve. R. Schmude&lt;ref Name="Schmude2004"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Schmude2006"/&gt; obtained many of the [[Mars]] brightness measurements used in a comprehensive phase curve analysis performed by A. Mallama.&lt;ref name="MallamaMars"/&gt;

Because the orbit of Mars is considerably eccentric its brightness at opposition can range from magnitude −3.0 to −1.4.&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt; The minimum brightness is about magnitude +1.6&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt; when Mars is on the opposite site of the Sun from the Earth. Rotational variations can elevate or suppress the brightness of Mars by 5% and global dust storms can increase its luminosity by 25%.&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MallamaMars"/&gt;

==Gas giants==

The outermost planets ([[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]) are so distant that only small portions of their phase curves near 0° (full phase) can be evaluated from the Earth. That part of the curve is generally fairly flat, like that of Venus, for these cloudy planets.

The apparent magnitude of Jupiter ranges from −2.9 to −1.4, Saturn from −0.5 to +1.4, Uranus from +5.3 to +6.0, and Neptune from +7.8 to +8.0. Most of these variations are due to distance. However, the magnitude range for Saturn also depends on its ring system as explained below.

{{see also|Gas giants}}

==The rings of Saturn==

[[File:Saturn Phase Curve 2.jpg|thumb|The phase curve of Saturn, according to Schmude&lt;ref Name="Schmude2010"/&gt; demonstrating the opposition effect of the ring system.]]

The brightness of the Saturn system depends on the orientation of [[Rings of Saturn|its ring system]]. The rings contribute more to the overall brightness of the system when they are more inclined to the direction of illumination from the Sun and to the view of the observer. Wide open rings contribute about one magnitude of brightness to the disk alone.&lt;ref Name="MallamaSky"/&gt; The icy particles that compose the rings also produce a strong opposition surge. Hubble Space Telescope and Cassini spacecraft images have been analyzed in an attempt to characterize the ring particles based on their phase curves.&lt;ref Name="French"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Poulet"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Cuzzi"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Salo2010"/&gt;

==The Moon==

[[File:Moon Phase Curve 5.jpg|thumb|The phase curve of the Moon&lt;ref name="CoxMoon"/&gt; compared to Mercury.&lt;ref name="MallamaMercury"/&gt;]]

The phase curve of the [[Moon]] approximately resembles that of Mercury due to the similarities of the surfaces and the lack of an atmosphere on either body.&lt;ref name="Warell"/&gt; [[Clementine (spacecraft)|Clementine]] spacecraft data analyzed by J. Hillier, B. Buratti and K. Hill&lt;ref Name="Hillier"/&gt; indicate a lunar opposition surge. The Moon's apparent magnitude at full phase is −12.7&lt;ref name="WilliamsMoon"/&gt; while at quarter phase it is 21 percent as bright.&lt;ref name="CoxMoon"/&gt;

==Planetary satellites==

The phase curves of many [[natural satellite]]s of other planets&lt;ref Name="Bauer"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Deau"/&gt; have been observed and interpreted. The icy moons often exhibit opposition brightness surges. This behavior has been used to model their surfaces.

==Asteroids==

The phase curves of many [[asteroid]]s&lt;ref Name="CoxAsteroids"/&gt; have also been observed and they too may exhibit opposition surges. Asteroids can be physically classified in this way.&lt;ref Name="Kaasalainen"/&gt; The effects of rotation can be very large and have to be factored in before the phase curve is computed. An example of such a study is reported by R. Baker and colleagues.&lt;ref Name="Baker"/&gt;

==Exoplanets==

Programs for characterizing planets outside of the solar system depend largely on spectroscopy to identify atmospheric constituents and states, especially those that point to the presence of life forms or which could support life. However, brightness can be measured for very distant Earth-sized objects that are too faint for spectroscopic analysis. A. Mallama&lt;ref name="MallamaExo"/&gt; has demonstrated that phase curve analysis may be a useful tool for identifying planets that are Earth-like. Additionally, J. Bailey&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; has pointed out that phase curve anomalies such as the [[Phase curve (astronomy)#Venus|brightness excess of Venus]] could be useful indicators of atmospheric constituents such as water, which might be essential to [[Extraterrestrial life|life in the universe]].

==Criticisms on phase curve modelling==

Inferences about regoliths from phase curves are frequently based on [[Hapke parameters|Hapke parameterization]]. However, in a blind test M. Shepard and P. Helfenstein&lt;ref Name="Shepard"/&gt; found no strong evidence that a particular set of [[Hapke parameters]] derived from photometric data could uniquely reveal the physical state of laboratory samples. These tests included modeling the three-term Henyey-Greenstein phase functions and the coherent backscatter opposition effect. This negative finding suggests that the radiative transfer model developed by [[Bruce William Hapke|B. Hapke]] may be inadequate for physical modeling based on photometry.

The '''photometric parallax method''' is a method of data analysis used in [[astronomy]] that uses the colours and apparent brightnesses of stars to infer their distances. It was used by the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] to discover the [[Virgo super star cluster]].

Unlike the [[stellar parallax]] method, photometric parallax can be used to estimate the distances of stars over 10 kpc away, at the expense of much more limited accuracy for individual measurements. Strictly speaking, it does not actually employ any measurements of parallax and can be considered a misnomer.

Assuming that a star is on the main sequence, the star's [[absolute magnitude]] can be determined based on its color. Once the absolute and apparent magnitudes are known, the distance to the star can be determined by using the [[distance modulus]].

In [[physical cosmology]], the '''photon epoch''' was the period in the evolution of the early universe in which [[photon]]s dominated the energy of the universe. The photon epoch started after most [[leptons| leptons and anti-leptons]] were [[annihilation|annihilated]] at the end of the [[lepton epoch]], about 10 seconds after the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knowledgetreeproject.org/beginningweb.htm The Timescale of Creation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728123714/http://www.knowledgetreeproject.org/beginningweb.htm |date=2009-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Atomic nuclei were created in the process of [[nucleosynthesis]] which occurred during the first few minutes of the photon epoch. For the remainder of the photon epoch, the universe contained a hot dense [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of nuclei, electrons and photons. 370,000 years after the Big Bang the temperature of the universe fell to the point where nuclei could combine with electrons to create neutral atoms. As a result, photons no longer interacted frequently with matter, the universe became transparent and the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] was created and then [[structure formation]] took place.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10221">'''Political globalization''' refers to the growth of the worldwide [[political system]], both in size and complexity. That system includes [[Government|national government]]s, their [[governmental organizations|governmental]] and [[intergovernmental organizations]] as well as government-independent elements of [[global civil society]] such as [[international non-governmental organizations]] and [[social movement organization]]s. One of the key aspects of the political globalization is the declining importance of the [[nation-state]] and the rise of other actors on the political scene. The creation and existence of the [[United Nations]] has been called one of the classic examples of political globalization.

Political globalization is one of the three main dimensions of globalization commonly found in academic literature, with the two other being [[economic globalization]] and [[cultural globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Babones|editor=George Ritzer|chapter=Studying Globalization: Methodological Issues|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA146|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But it also refers to the spread and influence of [[international non-governmental organization]]s, [[social movement organization]]s and transnational advocacy networks operating across borders and constituting a kind of [[global civil society]]."&lt;ref name="AmentaNash2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Crouch|chapter=Democracy and Capitalism in the Wake of the Financial Crisis|editor1=Edwin Amenta|editor2=Kate Nash|editor3=Alan Scott|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Political Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uz8gk5-a5CUC&amp;pg=PT487|date=2 February 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5507-9|page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[Gerard Delanty]] and [[Chris Rumford]] define it as "a tension between three processes which interact to produce the complex field of [[global politics]]: global [[geopolitics]], global [[normative culture]] and [[polycentric networks]]."&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-414"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerard Delanty|author2=Chris Rumford|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Political Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
[[Salvatore Babones]] discussing sources used by scholars for studying political globalizations noted the usefulness of [[Europa World Year Book]] for data on diplomatic relationships between countries, publications of [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] such as ''The Military Balance'' for matters of military, and US government publication ''Patterns of Global Terrorism'' for matters of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-152"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Babones|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Studying Globalization: Methodological Issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political globalization is measured by aggregating and weighting data on the number of embassies and high commissioners in a country, the number of the country's membership in international organization, its participation in the UN peacekeeping missions, and the number of international treaties signed by said country. This measure has been used by [[Axel Dreher]], [[Noel Gaston]], [[Pim Martens]] [[Jeffrey Haynes]] and is available from the [[KOF institute]] at [[ETH Zurich]]&lt;ref name="Haynes2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Haynes|title=Religion and Political Change in the Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8z-DCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT64|date=7 September 2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-69699-5|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Welfens2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul J.J.

==Aspects==
[[Dimensions of globalization|Like globalization itself]], political globalization has several dimensions and lends itself to a number of interpretations. It has been discussed in the context of new emancipatory possibilities, as well as in the context of loss of autonomy and fragmentation of the social world.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-414"/&gt; Political globalization can be seen in changes such as [[democratization]] of the world, creation of the global [[civil society]],&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-426"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerard Delanty|author2=Chris Rumford|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Political Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=426}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moving beyond the centrality of the [[nation-state]], particularly as the sole actor in the field of politics.&lt;ref name="Steger2003-56"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"/&gt; Some of the questions central to the discussion of the political globalization are related to the future of the nation-state, whether its importance is diminishing and what are the causes for those changes; and understanding the emergence of the concept of [[global governance]].&lt;ref name="Steger2003-57"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manfred B. Steger|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgVRoIOhYegC&amp;pg=PA57|date=27 March 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation and existence of the [[United Nations]] has been called one of the classic examples of political globalization.&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Annabelle Mooney|author2=Betsy Evans|title=Globalization: The Key Concepts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCV-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA194|date=12 March 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-20472-4|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political actions by non-governmental organizations and social movements, concerned about various topics such as [[environmental protection]], is another example.&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"/&gt;

[[David Held]] has proposed that continuing political globalization may lead to the creation of a [[world government]]-like [[cosmopolitan democracy]], though this vision has also been criticized as too idealistic.&lt;ref name="Steger2003-68"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manfred B. Steger|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgVRoIOhYegC&amp;pg=PA68|date=27 March 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political Globalization and Nation State==
There is a heated debate over Political Globalization and Nation State. The question arises whether or not political globalization signifies the decline of the nation-state. Hyper globalists argue that globalization has engulfed today's world in such a way that state boundaries are beginning to lose significance. However, skeptics disregard this as naiveté, believing that the nation-state remains the supreme actor in international relations. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://internationalaffairsbd.com/political-globalization-nation-state/|title=Contemporary Debate on Political Globalization and Nation StateYeg=PA68|author=|first=|last2=|date=2017|publisher=International Affairs, UK|year=|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|location=|page=68|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrêsa do Nascimento''' (1859{{ndash}}1927) was a [[courtesan]] and celebrated society figure in ''[[fin de siècle]]'' [[Lisbon]]. She was better known as '''Preta Fernanda''' (literally: Black Fernanda) and '''Fernanda do Vale''' (her ''[[nom de plume]]''). She was, perhaps, the best known black citizen of the city in that period.&lt;ref name="hatton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="debaixo"&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://expressodasilhas.cv/opiniao/2017/08/08/debaixo-da-nossa-pele-iv-retrato-de-uma-senhora/54219 |title=Debaixo da nossa Pele IV: Retrato de Uma Senhora |date=8 August 2017 |newspaper=Expresso das Ilhas |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nascimento was born to poor parents in a small village near [[Ribeira da Barca]] on the island of [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]] in [[Cape Verde]], probably in 1859.&lt;ref name="arlivre"&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://expressodasilhas.cv/opiniao/2017/10/20/ar-livre-a-preta-fernanda-no-coracao-do-imperio/55003 |title=Ar livre: A preta Fernanda no coração do império |date=20 October 2017 |newspaper=Expresso das Ilhas |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="testemunhos"/&gt; Cape Verde, a volcanic archipelago off the west coast of Africa, was a [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese colony]] and a nexus for the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. Although slavery was abolished in [[Portugal]] nearly a century earlier, it was only selectively abolished in Cape Verde in 1857 with complete abolition in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cape Verde at the End of Atlantic Slavery |author-first=Daryle |author-last=Williams |journal=Slavery &amp; Abolition |year=2015 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=160-179 |doi=10.1080/0144039X.2014.924253|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0144039X.2014.924253}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible, therefore, that one or both of Nascimento's parents were enslaved when she was born or had been enslaved.

When she was about 19, she sailed away from the small Atlantic island in the company of a ship's captain, Jerónimo Martins, who promised her marriage, but abandoned her once they arrived in [[Dakar]], on the African coast.&lt;ref name="arlivre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guinote"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41105182 |title=The Old Bohemian Lisbon (c. 1870-c. 1920): Prostitutes, Criminals and Bohemians |author-first=Paulo |last=Guinote |journal=Portuguese Studies |volume=18 |year=2002 |pages=71-95 |publisher=Modern Humanities Research Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="valdemar"&gt;{{cite newspaper |author-first=António |author-last=Valdemar |title=Avenida da Liberdade |newspaper=Diário de Notícias |url=http://domedioorienteeafins.blogspot.com/2014/03/a-preta-fernanda.html |language=Portuguese |access-date=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently married a German beer maker, Frederick "Fritz" Kemps, who took her to [[Lisbon]], and with whom she had twins. According to some sources her husband died; others say he was habitually drunk and abandoned her.&lt;ref name="debaixo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arlivre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guinote"/&gt;

Regardless, Nascimento found herself alone again, and in order to support herself and her children, she worked briefly as a model for Italian sculptor [[Giovanni Ciniselli]]. She is immortalized in [[Dom Luís Square]] in Lisbon as a figure supporting the sculpture of the [[Bernardo de Sá Nogueira de Figueiredo, 1st Marquis of Sá da Bandeira|Marquis of Sá da Bandeira]], famed for his [[abolitionist]] efforts. Nascimento posed for Ciniselli's depiction of an [[Slavery in Portugal|enslaved African woman]], broken chains on her ankles and a child in her lap. The woman faces her child while pointing at the figure of the Marquis above them, as if extolling the nobleman. The sculpture was funded by a public subscription and was unveiled by [[Luís I of Portugal|King Luís I]] in 1884.&lt;ref name="apartheid"&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.publico.pt/2017/03/25/local/noticia/andar-atras-das-memorias-africanas-para-conhecer-lisboa-1766414 |title=Do ''apartheid'' envergonhado à "Preta Fernanda": o rasto de África nas ruas de Lisboa |author-first=Margarida David |author-last=Cardoso |date=25 March 2017 |newspaper=Publico |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hatton"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stB0DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108 |title=Queen of the Sea: A History of Lisbon |author-first=Barry |author-last=Hatton |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2018 |isbn=9781787381070 |pages=108-109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She found steadier work in 1889 as a lady's maid for a high society woman, a member of the influential Cavalcanti family.&lt;ref name="debaixo"/&gt; She stayed in this position for nearly two decades.

After eighteen years, she left the lady's service and, using her savings and her society contacts, opened a brothel in Lisbon's [[Bairro Alto]] neighborhood, which she quickly established as a nightly meeting place for writers, politicians and [[Bohemianism|bohemians]] of the Portuguese capital.&lt;ref name="arlivre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hatton"/&gt; Nascimento became one of the most famous courtesans in Lisbon; she had many lovers, from sailors and soldiers to influential writers and legal scholars, and was a regular figure at the hottest night-spots.&lt;ref name="guinote"/&gt; Glamorous and unafraid of scandal, Nascimento, it is claimed, once [[Portuguese-style bullfighting|fought a bull on horseback]] in [[Algés (Oeiras)|Algés]], and she accompanied famed author [[José Maria de Eça de Queirós]] to his box at the [[Teatro da Trinidade]].&lt;ref name="apartheid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hatton"/&gt; She was also, reportedly, the only woman who remained in the room when [[futurism|futurist]] [[Almada Negreiros]] presented his—at the time—shocking ''Ultimatum Futurista'' in April of 1917.&lt;ref name="apartheid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="testemunhos"&gt;{{cite web |title=Preta Fernanda |work=Testemunhos da Escravatura (Testimonies of Slavery) |publisher=Lisbon City Hall |url=http://testemunhosdaescravatura.pt/pt/pessoas/figuras/preta-fernanda |access-date=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Recordações d'uma Colonial.jpg|thumb|Nascimento dressed as a bull-fighter on the cover of the first edition of ''Recordações d'uma Colonial'']]
In 1912 Nascimento published an autobiography, ''Recordações d'uma Colonial'' (''Recollections of a Colonial Subject''), written with help from two friends.&lt;ref name="arlivre"/&gt; The memoir tells the story of her life in Cape Verde and Portugal, but the authors sometimes forsook accuracy in favor of a more exciting story.&lt;ref name="hatton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arlivre"/&gt; She diligently recorded all of the men who had shared her bed (but not their true names), and in the final chapter offered candid commentary on each man's sexual performance.&lt;ref name="debaixo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="valdemar"/&gt; A modern reader notes that, in today's context, the language of the book is racist and reflects stereotypes of its time.&lt;ref name="debaixo"/&gt;

Little is known of her life after 1912. Nascimento died in Lisbon on 20 August 1927.&lt;ref name="testemunhos"/&gt;

'''Radio Progreso &amp; ERIC-SJ''' (''Equipo de Reflexión, Investigación y Comunicación'' – ERIC) is a [[Jesuit]] center for reflection, research, and communications, founded in [[El Progreso]], [[Honduras]], in 1980. Its stated aim is to improve the human rights of the rural poor in Honduras.&lt;ref name=cpal/&gt; Its work has been extended to the rest of [[Central America]].

==History==
Honduras ranks second from the bottom in all of [[Latin America]] in per capita [[GDP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Latin-America/gdp-per-capita|title=GDP per Capita in Latin-America {{!}} Real GDP per Capita in Latin-America|last=Guide|first=Global Property|website=www.globalpropertyguide.com|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has the highest per capita homicide rate in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/VC.IHR.PSRC.P5|title=Intentional homicides (per 100,000 people) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ERIC-SJ began from an initiative of Fernando Bandeiram, S.J., as a service to the Catholic parishes around El Progresso, [[Yoro]] District, to help the people reflect on the situation of their country as it impacted them.&lt;ref name=cpal/&gt; In May 1980 three other Jesuits joined Bandeiram and founded the Reflection, Research and Communication Center at what became Casa San Ignacio at the Jesuit property in El Progresso.

Courses were offered on the "national reality" and a monthly newsletter was published focused especially on the [[Catholic Church]] in Latin America. Services were extended to the clergy in [[San Pedro Sula]], [[Copán Department]], and to the general meetings of CONFEREH, which brings together religious congregations that work against human trafficking in Central America.&lt;ref name=cpal/&gt;

Early works included dissemination throughout Central America of a denunciation of the massacre allegedly carried out by the El Salvadoran National Guard on the banks of the [[Sumpul River]] in [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref name=cpal/&gt; This was followed by efforts to organize the [[Jicaque people]] in [[Yoro]], [[Olanchito]], and [[Morazán Department]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, assisting them with their land titles.&lt;ref name=cpal&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cpalsocial.org/centro_134.html|title=ERIC - Equipo de reflexión, investigación y comunicación|newspaper=cpalsocial.org|language=es-CO|access-date=2016-12-12}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Berta Cáceres]], who became world prominent for her efforts to secure water rights for the people and was assassinated for her efforts, was "working in alliance with the parishes of Atlántida and the ERIC and Radio Progreso, initiatives of the Jesuit Ismael Moreno"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presenciaadsis.org/berta-caceres-mujer-indigena-y-cristiana/|title=Berta Cáceres. Mujer indígena y cristiana – Presencia Adsis|website=www.presenciaadsis.org|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eleconomista.com.mx/internacional/2016/03/05/despiden-ambientalista-berta-caceres-honduras|title=Despiden a la ambientalista Berta Cáceres en Honduras|last=Afp|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univision.com/noticias/asesinatos/miles-asisten-al-sepelio-de-la-am Univision. Accessed 14 December 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the station and center today includes grassroots radio programming, training on human rights, urging greater government transparency and accountability, community organizing and empowerment, combating violence against women, formation of leadership committed to social change, and assisting returned migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cafodca.org/contrapartes/11/|title=Equipo de Reflexión, Investigación y Comunicación / Radio Progreso|website=cafodca.org|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of the 2009 coup in Honduras, Jesuits from around Latin America met and expressed their support of ERIC-SJ efforts to oppose the killings and restore constitutional government to Honduras. Signatories to the document included the farmers' rights groups [[Center for Research and Promotion of Farmers|CIPCA]] in Bolivia, [[Instituto Mayor Campesino|IMCA]] in Colombia, CEPAG in Paraguay, and ALBOAN in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedoh.org/publicaciones/articulos/files/A mecate corto.pdf CEDOH. Accessed 14 December 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

ERIC also represents Honduras in hearings before the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]], as in cases involving intrusion by mining and energy companies on the water rights of local communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aida-americas.org/organizations-testify-inter-american-commission-human-rights-regarding-systematic-violation-of-the-right-to-water|title=NGOs testify before IACHR regarding violation of the right to water by extractive activities|date=2015-10-26|newspaper=AIDA|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===
''Amecate Corto'' is the monthly newsletter and is styled "another look at reality"; it focuses on the misbehavior of the rich and powerful and the plight of ordinary people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://radioprogresohn.net/index.php/amecate-corto/periodico-mensual|title=Periódico Mensual|website=radioprogresohn.net|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6989">The '''Saffman–Delbrück model''' describes a [[Lipid bilayer|lipid membrane]] as a thin layer of [[Viscous liquid|viscous fluid]], surrounded by a less viscous bulk liquid.  This picture was originally proposed to determine the [[diffusion]] coefficient of membrane proteins, but has also been used to describe the dynamics of fluid domains within lipid membranes. The Saffman–Delbrück formula is often applied to determine the size of an object embedded in a membrane from its observed [[Brownian motion|diffusion coefficient]], and is characterized by the weak logarithmic dependence of diffusion constant on object radius.
[[Image:sd-illus-wiki.png|frame|Embedded cylindrical object of radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in a membrane with viscosity &lt;math&gt;\eta_m&lt;/math&gt;, height &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, surrounded by bulk fluid with viscosity &lt;math&gt;\eta_f&lt;/math&gt;|right]]

==Origin==
In a three-dimensional highly viscous liquid, a spherical object of radius ''a'' has diffusion coefficient

: &lt;math&gt;
D_{3D} = \frac{k_B T}{6 \pi \eta a}
&lt;/math&gt;

by the well-known [[Stokes–Einstein relation]]. By contrast, the diffusion coefficient of a circular object embedded in a two-dimensional fluid diverges; this is [[Stokes' paradox]]. In a real lipid membrane, the diffusion coefficient may be limited by:

# the size of the membrane
# the inertia of the membrane (finite [[Reynolds number]])
# the effect of the liquid surrounding the membrane

[[Philip Saffman]] and [[Max Delbrück]] calculated the diffusion coefficient for these three cases, and showed that Case 3 was the relevant effect.&lt;ref name="sd"&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/72/8/3111.abstract P. G. Saffman and M. Delbrück, ''Brownian motion in biological membranes'', Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, vol. 72 p. 3111–3113 1975]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saffman–Delbrück formula==
The diffusion coefficient of a cylindrical inclusion of radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in a membrane with thickness &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and [[viscosity]] &lt;math&gt;\mu_m&lt;/math&gt;, surrounded by bulk fluid with viscosity &lt;math&gt;\mu_f&lt;/math&gt; is:

: &lt;math&gt;
D_{sd} = \frac{k_B T}{4 \pi \mu_m h} \left[\ln(2 L_{sd} / a) - \gamma\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

where the Saffman–Delbrück length &lt;math&gt;L_{sd} = \frac{h \mu_m}{2 \mu_f}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma\approx 0.577&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]]. Typical values of &lt;math&gt;L_{sd}&lt;/math&gt; are 0.1 to 10 micrometres.&lt;ref name="petrovschwille"&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=2242757 | pmid=18192354 | doi=10.1529/biophysj.107.126565 | volume=94 | title=Translational diffusion in lipid membranes beyond the Saffman-Delbruck approximation | journal=Biophys J | pages=L41-3 | last1 = Petrov | first1 = EP | last2 = Schwille | first2 = P | year=2008| bibcode=2008BpJ....94L..41P }}&lt;/ref&gt; This result is an approximation applicable for radii &lt;math&gt;a \ll L_{sd}&lt;/math&gt;, which is appropriate for proteins (&lt;math&gt;a\approx&lt;/math&gt; nm), but not for micrometre-scale lipid domains.

The Saffman–Delbrück formula predicts that diffusion coefficients &lt;math&gt;D_{sd}&lt;/math&gt; will only depend weakly on the size of the embedded object; for example, if &lt;math&gt;L_{sd} = 1 \mu m&lt;/math&gt;, changing &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; from 1&amp;nbsp;nm to 10&amp;nbsp;nm only reduces the diffusion coefficient &lt;math&gt;D_{sd}&lt;/math&gt; by&amp;nbsp;30%.

==Beyond the Saffman–Delbrück length==
Hughes, Pailthorpe, and White extended the theory of Saffman and Delbrück to inclusions with any radii &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;;&lt;ref name="hpw"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hughes | first1 = B.D. | last2 = Pailthorpe | first2 = B.A. | last3 = White'' | first3 = L.R. | year = 1981 | title = The translational and rotational drag on a cylinder moving in a membrane | doi = 10.1017/S0022112081000785 | journal = J.

: &lt;math&gt;
D \to \frac{k_B T}{8 \eta_m h a} \frac{L_{sd}}{a}
&lt;/math&gt;

A useful formula that produces the correct diffusion coefficients between these two limits is &lt;ref name="petrovschwille"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
D = \frac{k_B T}{4 \pi \eta_m h} \left[\ln(2/\epsilon) - \gamma + 4\epsilon/\pi - (\epsilon^2/2)\ln(2/\epsilon)\right] \left[1 - (\epsilon^3/\pi) \ln(2/\epsilon) + c_1 \epsilon^{b_1} / (1 + c_2 \epsilon^{b_2}) \right]^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = a / L_{sd}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_1 = 2.74819&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_2 = 0.51465&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_1 = 0.73761&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;c_2 = 0.52119&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Site and services''' is an approach to bringing shelter within the economic reach of the poor.

==History==
Recognizing that the vast majority of low income families in the world build their own shelter, which lacks basic [[hygiene]], access and electricity, the strategy was developed. The approach first appeared on a large scale in [[Madras]] (now [[Chennai]]) in 1972 when the [[World Bank]] engaged [[Christopher Charles Benninger]] to advise the Madras Metropolitan Development Authority (MMDA) on their housing sector investments. The approach links the user group's ability to pay with land prices and the costs of rudimentary and upgradable [[infrastructure]]. The fundamental idea is to market plots with essential infrastructure at market prices, to avoid the resale of [[subsidized housing]], directed at low-income groups. The first major scheme planned by Benninger, at Arambakkum in Chennai, created about 7,000 shelter units, within the paying capacity of the urban poor.  Within five years the MMDA created more than 20,000 units and the approach became a major strategy of the World Bank to tackle a variety of shelter problems globally.

'''Sociology of leisure''' or '''leisure sociology''' is the study of how humans organize their [[leisure|free time]]. Leisure includes a broad array of activities, such as [[sport]], [[tourism]], and the playing of [[game]]s. The sociology of leisure is closely tied to the [[sociology of work]], as each explores a different side of the work-leisure relationship. More recent studies in the field move away from the work-leisure relationship and focus on the relation between leisure and [[culture]].

Studies of leisure have determined that observable patterns cannot be easily explained by socioeconomic variables such as income, occupation or education. The type of leisure activity is substantially influenced by the individual's situation (presence or lack of family, age, and other factors).

==Theory==
Sociology of leisure is a fairly recent [[subfields of sociology|subfield of sociology]], compared to more traditional subfields such as [[sociology of work]], [[sociology of the family]], and [[sociology of education]]: it saw most of its development in the second half of the 20th century.{{Ref label|a|a|none}}&lt;ref name=parker&gt;Stanley Parker, "The Sociology of Leisure: Progress and Problems," ''The British Journal of Sociology'', vol. 26, no. 1, March 1975, pp. 91-101.

[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-leisuresociologicalstudsf.html Online]. Last accessed on 20 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, leisure had often been seen as a relatively unimportant, minor feature of [[society]].&lt;ref name=parker/&gt; Leisure is now recognized as a major [[social institution]], deserving of serious sociological inquiry, particularly in Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Frey, David R. Dickens, "Leisure as a Primary Institution," ''Sociological Inquiry.'' vol. 60, no. 3, 1990, pp. 264-73, ON: 1475-682X, {{doi|10.1111/j.1475-682X.1990.tb00144.x}}. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-682X.1990.tb00144.x]&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[John Wilson (sociologist)|John Wilson]] and others have noted, it is difficult to define [[leisure]].&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt;&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;John Wilson, "The Sociology of Leisure," ''Annual Review of Sociology'', vol. 6, August 1980, pp. 21-40. [http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.so.06.080180.000321 Online], [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2946003 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Its definitions are numerous and often mutually contradictory, for example as a discrete portion of one's time or as a quality of experience irrespective of time.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; [[Joffre Dumazedier]] distinguished four distinct definitions of leisure, which begin broadly and gradually narrow in scope.&lt;ref name=parker/&gt; The first and broadest defines leisure as a style of behavior that may occur even at work, the second defines it as any non-work activity; the third further excludes family and household obligations; and, finally, the narrowest defines leisure as activities dedicated to [[self-fulfillment]]. Dumazedier's four definitions are not exhaustive.&lt;ref name=parker/&gt; Incompatible definitions and measures are seen as a major factor accounting for occasionally contradictory research findings.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;

There are some unresolved questions concerning the definition of work: in particular, whether unpaid endeavors, such as volunteering or studying, are work.&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt; Non-work time should not be equated with free time, as it comprises not only free time, dedicated to leisure, but also time dedicated to certain obligatory activities, such as [[Homemaking|housework]].&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Dividing activities into free and dedicated time is not easy. For example, brushing one's teeth is neither work nor leisure; scholars differ in their classifications of activities such as eating a meal, shopping, repairing a car, attending a religious ceremony, or showering (various individuals may or may not classify such activities as leisure).&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; The relation between work and leisure can also be unclear: research indicates that some individuals find skills that they have acquired at work useful to their hobbies (and vice versa), and some individuals have used leisure activities to advance their work careers.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Sociologists also disagree as to whether political or spiritual activities should be included in studies of leisure.&lt;ref name=parker2&gt;S.R. Parker, "Sociology of Leisure," ''Sociology'', 10 (1), 1976, Oxford (0038-0385), p. 166. [http://soc.sagepub.com+166.pdf Online]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, among some [[occupational community|occupational communities]], such as police officers or miners, it is common for work colleagues to be off-time friends and to share similar, work-based leisure activities.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;

Apart from a definition of leisure, there are other questions of theoretical concern to the sociologist of leisure. For example, quantifying the results is difficult, as time-budget studies have noted that a given amount of time (for example, an hour) may have different values, depending on when it occurs—within a day, a week, or a year.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Finally, as with many other fields of inquiry in the social sciences, the study of the sociology of leisure is hampered by the lack of reliable data for comparative [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]], as there was little to no standardized data-gathering on leisure throughout most of human history.&lt;ref name=parker/&gt; The lack of longitudinal studies has been remedied in the last few decades by recurring national [[tatistical survey|surveys]] such as the [[General Household Survey]] in the United Kingdom (ongoing since 1971).&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt; In addition to surveys, an increasing number of studies have been focusing on [[qualitative research|qualitative methods]] of research ([[interviews]]).&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt;

==Research==
Over time, emphasis in studies of leisure has shifted from the work-leisure relation, particularly in well-researched majorities, to study of minorities and the relation between leisure and [[culture]].&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt; [[Marshall Gordon]] noted that there are two approaches in the study of leisure: formal and historical-theoretical.&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; The formal approach focuses on [[empirical]] questions, such as the shifting of leisure patterns over an individual's [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]], the relation between leisure and work, and specific forms of leisure (such as the [[sociology of sport]]).&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; The historical-theoretical approach studies the relation between leisure and [[social change]], often from [[structural functionalist|structural-functionalist]] and [[neo-Marxist]] perspectives.&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; [[Sheila Scraton]] provided a different analysis, comparing [[North America]]n and [[Great Britain|British]] studies.&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt; The British approaches focus on input from [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]], [[critical Marxism]], and [[feminism]]; the American approaches concentrate on the [[social psychology|social-psychological]] tradition.&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt;

==Findings==
Many sociologists have assumed that a given type of leisure activity is most easily explained by [[socioeconomic]] variables such as [[income]], [[Employment|occupation]] or [[education]].&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; This has yielded fewer results than expected; income is associated with total money spent on such activities, but otherwise only determines what type of activities are affordable.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Occupation has a similar effect, because most occupations heavily influence a person's income (for example, membership in a prestigious occupation and "[[country club|country-club]]" activities such as golf or sailing are significantly [[correlation|correlated]]—but so is membership in those occupations and high income, and those activities with high cost).&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Education is correlated with having a wide range of leisure activities, and with higher dedication to them.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; As Kelly noted, "Predicting a person's leisure behavior on the basis of his socioeconomic position is all but impossible."&lt;ref&gt;J. Kelly, "Socialization toward Leisure: a Developmental Approach," ''Journal of Leisure Research'', vol. 6, 1974, pp. 181-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, type of leisure activity is substantially influenced by the individual's immediate situation—whether he has a family, whether there are recreational facilities nearby, and age.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Early family influences, particularly involving the more social leisure activities, can be profound.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; The type of leisure activity also depends on the individual's current place in the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]].&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;

Specific findings in sociological studies of leisure are illustrated by [[John Robinson (sociologist)|John Robinson]]'s late-1970s study of American leisure. Robinson found that Americans, on average, have four hours of leisure time each weekday, and more on weekends—six hours on Saturdays, almost eight on Sundays.&lt;ref&gt;John Robinson, ''How Americans Use Their Time: A Social-Psychological Analysis of Everyday Behavior'', New York, Praeger, 1977, pp. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Amount of leisure time diminishes with age, work, marriage, and children.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; However, the amount of free time does not significantly depend on an individual's wealth.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; People desire less free time if they are uncertain of their economic future, or if their job is their central interest.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; During the second half of the twentieth century, watching [[television]] became a major leisure activity, causing a substantial decrease in the time dedicated to other activities; in the early 1970s the average American had 4 hours of leisure per day, and spent 1.5 of them watching television.&lt;ref name=robinson&gt;J. Robinson and P. Converse, "Social Change Reflected in the Use of Time," in A. Campbell and P. Converse, eds., ''The Human Meaning of Social Change'', New York, Russell Sage, 1972, pp. 17-86.&lt;/ref&gt; Shared leisure activities increase marital satisfaction.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12373">{{More citations needed|date=December 2006}}'''Stellar dynamics''' is the branch of [[astrophysics]] which describes in a statistical way the collective motions of [[star]]s subject to their mutual [[gravity]]. The essential difference from [[celestial mechanics]] is that each star contributes more or less equally to the total gravitational field, whereas in celestial mechanics the pull of a massive body dominates any satellite orbits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Astronomy and Astrophysics|last=Murdin|first=Paul|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|year=2001|isbn=978-0750304405|location=|pages=1|chapter=Stellar Dynamics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the methods utilized in stellar dynamics originated from the fields of both [[classical mechanics]] and [[statistical mechanics]]. In essence, the fundamental problem of stellar dynamics is the [[N-body problem]], where the N members refer to the members of a given stellar system. Given the large number of objects in a stellar system, stellar dynamics is usually concerned with the more global, statistical properties of several orbits rather than with the specific data on the positions and velocities of individual orbits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The motions of stars in a [[galaxy]] or in a [[globular cluster]] are principally determined by the average distribution of the other, distant stars. Stellar encounters involve processes such as relaxation, [[Mass segregation (astronomy)|mass segregation,]] [[Tidal force|tidal forces]], and [[dynamical friction]] that influence the trajectories of the system's members.

Stellar dynamics also has connections to the field of plasma physics. The two fields underwent significant development during a similar time period in the early 20th century, and both borrow mathematical formalism originally developed in the field of [[Fluid mechanics|fluid mechanics.]]

== Key Concepts ==
Stellar dynamics involves determining the gravitational potential of a substantial amount of stars. The stars can be modeled as point masses whose orbits are determined by the combined interactions with each other. Typically, these point masses represent stars in a variety of clusters or galaxies, such as a [[Galaxy cluster]], or a [[Globular cluster]]. From [[Newton's second law]] an equation describing the interactions of an isolated stellar system can be written down as,

&lt;math&gt;m_i\frac{d \mathbf{r_i}}{dt} = \sum_{i=1 \atop i \ne j}^N \frac{G m_i m_j \left(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j\right)}{\left\| \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j\right\|^3}
 &lt;/math&gt;

which is simply a formulation of the N-body problem. For an N-body system, any individual member, &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; is influenced by the gravitational potentials of the remaining &lt;math&gt;m_j&lt;/math&gt; members. In practice, it is not feasible to calculate the system's gravitational potential by adding all of the point-mass potentials in the system, so stellar dynamicists develop potential models that can accurately model the system while remaining computationally inexpensive.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Galactic Dynamics|last=Binney|first=James|last2=Tremaine|first2=Scott|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-691-13027-9|location=Princeton|pages=35, 63, 65, 698}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gravitational potential, &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;, of a system is related to the gravitational field, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\vec{g}}&lt;/math&gt; by:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\vec{g}} = -\nabla \Phi&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the mass density, &lt;math&gt;\rho &lt;/math&gt;, is related to the potential via [[Poisson's equation]]:

&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2\Phi = 4\pi G \rho &lt;/math&gt;

=== Gravitational Encounters and Relaxation ===
Stars in a stellar system will influence each other's trajectories due to strong and weak gravitational encounters. An encounter between two stars is defined to be strong if the change in potential energy between the two is greater than or equal to their initial kinetic energy. Strong encounters are rare, and they are typically only considered important in dense stellar systems, such as the cores of globular clusters.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Galaxies in the Universe|last=Sparke|first=Linda|last2=Gallagher|first2=John|publisher=Cambridge|year=2007|isbn=978-0521855938|location=New York|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weak encounters have a more profound effect on the evolution of a stellar system over the course of many orbits. The effects of gravitational encounters can be studied with the concept of [[Relaxation (physics)|relaxation]] time.

A simple example illustrating relaxation is two-body relaxation, where a star's orbit is altered due to the gravitational interaction with another star. Initially, the subject star travels along an orbit with initial velocity, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;, that is perpendicular to the [[impact parameter]], the distance of closest approach, to the field star whose gravitational field will affect the original orbit. Using Newton's laws, the change in the subject star's velocity, &lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;, is approximately equal to the acceleration at the impact parameter, multiplied by the time duration of the acceleration. The relaxation time can be thought as the time it takes for &lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; to equal &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;, or the time it takes for the small deviations in velocity to equal the star's initial velocity. The relaxation time for a stellar system of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; objects is approximately equal to:

&lt;math&gt;t_{\text{relax}} \backsimeq \frac{0.1N}{\ln N}t_\text{cross}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;t_{\text{cross}}&lt;/math&gt; is known as the crossing time, the time it takes for a star to travel across the galaxy once.

The relaxation time identifies collisionless vs. collisional stellar systems. Dynamics on timescales less than the relaxation time are defined to be collisionless. They are also identified as systems where subject stars interact with a smooth gravitational potential as opposed to the sum of point-mass potentials.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Galactic Dynamics|last=Binney|first=James|last2=Tremaine|first2=Scott|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-691-13027-9|location=Princeton|pages=35, 63, 65, 698}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accumulated effects of two-body relaxation in a galaxy can lead to what is known as [[Mass segregation (astronomy)|mass segregation]], where more massive stars gather near the center of clusters, while the less massive ones are pushed towards the outer parts of the cluster.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Connections to statistical mechanics and plasma physics ==
The statistical nature of stellar dynamics originates from the application of the [[kinetic theory of gases]] to stellar systems by physicists such as [[James Jeans]] in the early 20th century. The [[Jeans equations]], which describe the time evolution of a system of stars in a gravitational field, are analogous to [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler's equations]] for an ideal fluid, and were derived from the [[collisionless Boltzmann equation]]. This was originally developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] to describe the non-equilibrium behavior of a thermodynamic system. Similarly to statistical mechanics, stellar dynamics make use of distribution functions that encapsulate the information of a stellar system in a probabilistic manner. The single particle phase-space distribution function, &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v},t)&lt;/math&gt;, is defined in a way such that

&lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v},t)\,\text{d}\mathbf{x}\,\text{d}\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

represents the probability of finding a given star with position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; around a differential volume &lt;math&gt;\text{d}\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; and velocity &lt;math&gt;\text{v}&lt;/math&gt; around a differential volume &lt;math&gt;\text{d}\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;. The distribution is function is normalized such that integrating it over all positions and velocities will equal unity. For collisional systems, [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]] is applied to study the microstate of a stellar system, and is also commonly used to study the different statistical ensembles of statistical mechanics.

In plasma physics, the collisionless Boltzmann equation is referred to as the [[Vlasov equation]], which is used to study the time evolution of a plasma's distribution function. Whereas Jeans applied the collisionless Boltzmann equation, along with Poisson's equation, to a system of stars interacting via the long range force of gravity, [[Anatoly Vlasov]] applied Boltzmann's equation with [[Maxwell's equations]] to a system of particles interacting via the [[Coulomb Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henon|first=M|date=June 21, 1982|title=Vlasov Equation?|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1982A%26A...114..211H|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=114|pages=211-212|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both approaches separate themselves from the kinetic theory of gases by introducing long-range forces to study the long term evolution of a many particle system. In addition to the Vlasov equation, the concept of [[Landau damping]] in plasmas was applied to gravitational systems by [[Donald Lynden-Bell]] to describe the effects of damping in spherical stellar systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynden-Bell|first=Donald|date=1962|title=The stability and vibrations of a gas of stars|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/124.4.279|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=124|pages=279-296|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Stellar dynamics is primarily used to study the mass distributions within stellar systems and galaxies. Early examples of applying stellar dynamics to clusters include [[Albert Einstein]]'s 1921 paper applying the [[virial theorem]] to spherical star clusters and [[Fritz Zwicky]]'s 1933 paper applying the virial theorem specifically to the [[Coma Cluster]], which was one of the original harbingers of the idea of [[dark matter]] in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Einstin|first=Albert|date=2002|title=A Simple Application of the Newtonian Law of Gravitation to Star Clusters|url=http://alberteinstein.info/vufind1/images/einstein/5-166.tr.pdf|journal=The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein|volume=7|pages=230-233|via=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zwicky|first=Fritz|date=2009|title=Republication of: The redshift of extragalactic nebulae|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009GReGr..41..207E|journal=General Relativity and Gravitation|volume=41|pages=207-224|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jeans equations have been used to understand different observational data of stellar motions in the Milky Way galaxy. For example, [[Jan Oort]] utilized the Jeans equations to determine the average matter density in the vicinity of the solar neighborhood, whereas the concept of asymmetric drift came from studying the Jeans equations in cylindrical coordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Astrophysics for Physicists|last=Choudhuri|first=Arnab Rai|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-81553-6|location=New York|pages=213-214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stellar dynamics also provides insight into the structure of galaxy formation and evolution. Dynamical models and observations are used to study the triaxial structure of elliptical galaxies and suggest that prominent spiral galaxies are created from [[Galaxy merger|galaxy mergers.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Stellar dynamical models are also used to study the evolution of active galactic nuclei and their black holes, as well as to estimate the mass distribution of dark matter in galaxies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4362">The '''Swedish Institute in Rome''' ({{lang-sv|Svenska Institutet i Rom}}, {{lang-it|Istituto Svedese di studi classici a Roma}}) is a research institution that serves as the base for archaeological excavations and other scientific research in [[Italy]]. It also pursues academic instruction in [[archaeology]] and art sciences as well as arranging conferences with themes of interest to the institute. The Institute has at its disposal a building in central [[Rome]] with a relatively well-supplied library, archaeological laboratory and around twenty rooms and smaller apartments for the use of visiting researchers and holders of scholarships.

The institute was founded in 1925 by, among others, King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf VI Adolf]], then Crown Prince of [[Sweden]].

==Excavations==
The Institute has conducted several major excavations. Before [[World War II]], excavations were carried out on the [[Forum Romanum]] among other places, but since then most of them have taken place in southern [[Etruria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isvroma.it/public/NEW/English/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=49&amp;Itemid=55 Istituto Svedese di studi classici a Roma - History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309011435/http://www.isvroma.it/public/New/English/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=49&amp;Itemid=55 |date=2017-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Beacon Light''''' is a painting by [[J. M. W. Turner]]. It was given to the [[National Museum of Wales]] by the Davies sisters ([[Gwendoline Davies|Gwendoline]] and [[Margaret Davies|Margaret]]). For some time it was regarded as a fake, but is now accepted as authentic.

==Provenance==
''Beacon Light'' was among a number of works that were said to have been given by Turner to his mistress, Mrs Booth. It was sold at Christie's by her son, John Pound (her son by her first marriage).

In 1922, it was sold as a genuine Turner and the Davies sisters (Gwendoline and Margaret) spent £2,625 to buy it.&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann, Luke; "The Davies sisters' Turners in Cardiff"; ''British Art Journal'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/industry-to-impressionism/ Museum of Wales] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011163636/http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/industry-to-impressionism/ |date=11 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of Gwendoline Davies, it was among seven works by Turner that were donated to the National Museum of Wales.

==Doubts as to authenticity==
Shortly after the donation, doubts were raised about its authenticity and that of two other Turners donated by the sisters.

Butlin and Joll dated the work to c1835-40 and suggest that it is a fragment of a larger canvas 'which has certainly been worked on by a hand other than Turner's'.&lt;ref&gt;Butlin, Martin, and Evelyn Joli. ''The Paintings of J. M. W. Turner''&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, it was believed to depict the Needles on the Isle of Wight

It was removed from display, but did appear in a 2007 exhibition. It returned to display in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/art/online/?action=show_item&amp;item=1836 National Museum of Wales]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Fake or Fortune?''==
It was featured on the BBC TV programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' Scientific analysis showed that the paint used was consistent with Turner's known usage and that the same paint had been used for the whole of the picture. An X-ray showed that a lighthouse at the summit of the bluff had been painted over. [[Philip Mould]] and [[Bendor Grosvenor]] were able to establish that the scene was near [[Margate]] and not on the [[Isle of Wight]] as had been previously believed. The evidence for the painting's authenticity was presented to [[Martin Butlin]], the co-author of the Turner ''[[catalogue raisonné]]'', who accepted that the work was genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode| title = Turner: A Miscarriage of Justice?|series = Fake or Fortune?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01n39kg|accessdate = 10 December 2012|network = BBC|date = 23 September 2012|seriesno=2|number=2|transcript =| transcripturl =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Way Things Work''''' is a 1988 children's book by [[David Macaulay]] with technical text by [[Neil Ardley]]. It is an entertaining introduction to everyday [[machine]]s, describing machines as simple as [[lever]]s and [[gear]]s and as complicated as [[radio telescope]]s and [[automatic transmission]]s. Every page consists primarily of one or more large diagrams describing the operation of the relevant machine. These diagrams are informative but playful, in that most show the machines operated, used upon, or represented by [[woolly mammoth]]s, and are accompanied by anecdotes of the mammoths' (fictive) role in the operation. The book's concept was later developed into a short-lived animated [[The Way Things Work (TV series)|TV show]] (produced by [[Millimages]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millimages.com/site/tv/prod.php?lang=en&amp;tv_id=6 |title=Television - THE WAY THINGS WORK |date=18 November 2008 |publisher=millimages.com |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118015449/http://www.millimages.com/site/tv/prod.php?lang=en&amp;tv_id=6 |archivedate=18 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and distributed by [[Schlessinger Media]]), a [[Dorling Kindersley]] interactive CD-ROM, and a [[board game]]. A family "ride" involving [[animatronics]] and a [[3-D film]] based on the book was one of the original attractions at the [[San Francisco]] [[Metreon]], but closed in 2001.

==''The New Way Things Work''==
A newer version, ''The New Way Things Work'', (released on October 26, 1998,) contains additional text on the workings of computers and digital technology.  It also lacks two pages of the first edition; both of which demonstrated the working of a mechanical coin-operated parking meter.

==''The Way Things Work Now''==
A substantially revised edition, ''The Way Things Work Now'', has been published in October 2016 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and Dorling Kindersley.

'''Tibetan calligraphy''' refers to the [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] traditions used to write the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]].  As in other parts of East Asia, nobles, high lamas, and persons of high rank were expected to have high abilities in calligraphy.  However, unlike calligraphy in [[Chinese calligraphy|China]], [[Japanese calligraphy|Japan]], and Korea, calligraphy was done using a reed pen as opposed to a brush.  Nevertheless, East Asian influence is apparent visually, as Tibetan calligraphy is at times more free-flowing than calligraphy involving the descendants of other [[Brahmic family|Brahmi]] scripts. Given the overriding religious nature of [[Tibetan culture]], many of the traditions in calligraphy come from religious texts, and most Tibetan scribes have a monastic background.&lt;ref&gt;https://tashimannox.com/index.php/tibetan-calligraphy/about-the-artist&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles==
A variety of different styles of calligraphy existed in Tibet:

* The '''[[Uchen script|Uchen]]''' ({{bo-textonly|དབུ་ཅན།}}, "headed"; also transliterated as ''uchan'' or ''dbu-can'') style of the [[Tibetan script]] is marked by heavy horizontal lines and tapering vertical lines, and is the most common script for writing in the Tibetan language, and also appears in printed form because of its exceptional clarity.  When handwritten, it is the most basic form of calligraphy, and must be mastered before moving onto other styles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kimsch.net/Tibetan%20Calligraphy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
** Ngatar ({{bo-textonly|སྔ་དར།}}) development
*** Toad - the initial Thonmi Sambhota edition
** Qitar ({{bo-textonly|ཕྱི་དར།}}) development
*** '''Sarqung''' or '''chung''' (standard ujain; {{bo-textonly|གསར་ཆུང༌།}})
*** '''Sugring'''
*** '''Sugtung'''
*** '''Sarqên'''
* The '''[[Umê script|umê]]''' ({{bo-textonly|དབུ་མེད།|ume=1}}, "headless"; or ''ume'') style is a more cursive script which can be seen in daily correspondence and in other day-to-day life.  The feature which distinguishes it the most from ''u-chan'' is the lack of the horizontal lines on the top of letters.
* The '''bêcug''' ({{bo-textonly|དཔེ་ཚུགས།}}; or ''betsu'') style is a narrow, cursive variant of ''umê'' in squarish shape.
* The ''zhuza'' ({{bo-textonly|འབྲུ་ཚ།}}; or ''drutsa'') style is a variant of ''umê'' but with ''ujain'' vowel symbol.
** curve-leg zhuza
** straight-leg zhuza
** short-leg zhuza
* The ''cugtung'' ({{bo-textonly|ཚུགས་ཐུང༌།}}; or ''tsugtung'') style is shortened, abbreviated variant of ''u-me'', traditionally used for commentaries.
* The ''cugrin'' ({{bo-textonly|ཚུགས་རིན།}}) style
* The ''kyug'yig'' ({{bo-textonly|འཁྱུག་ཡིག།}}, "fast letters"; or ''chuyig'') is a highly abbreviated, fluid, cursive version of ''u-me''.  It is a common form of handwriting for notes and personal letters.
** general cursive
** extremely cursive
* The ''cug-ma-kyug'' yig style - a style halfway between ''cug'yig'' and ''kyug'yig''
* The ''gyug'yig'' ({{bo-textonly|རྒྱུག་ཡིག།}}) style

==Other related styles==
The vertical [[Phagspa script|Phags-pa]] script is known as ''horyig'' ({{bo-textonly|ཧོར་ཡིག་}} ''hor-yig'', "Mongolian letters").  A more ornamental version of the ''horyig'' style was used in the past to make personal seals. It is often found written vertically as opposed to horizontally.

These styles are not fixed, and are not limited to those listed above. By mixing features of various styles, and adding various ornaments to the text, the number of styles becomes quite large. While ''ujain'' may be used to write entire [[Sutra]]s or Buddhist texts, the rest of the styles are more frequently used to write a single phrase or saying.

The '''University of Guadalajara''' ({{lang-es|Universidad de Guadalajara}}) is a [[public university|public]] [[higher education]] institution in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] city of [[Guadalajara]]. The University has several high schools as well as graduate and undergraduate campuses, which are distributed all over the state of [[Jalisco]], Mexico. It is regarded as the most significant university in the state and the second in the country, only behind the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]. Chronologically, based on its foundation, is the second oldest in Mexico, the seventeenth in North America and the fourteenth in Latin America.

Since 1994 the University works through a network model to organize its academic activities. This university network is integrated by 15 university centers, the '''Virtual University System''', the '''High School Education System''' and the general administrative body of the University. During 2014–2015 the total number of enrolled students is 255, 944, of which 116, 424 belong to graduate and undergraduate students and 139, 520 to high school students.

== History ==

=== The Royal University of Guadalajara (1791–1821) ===
[[File:Escudo de la Real y Literaria Universidad de Guadalajara.svg|thumb|left|Royal University of Guadalajara's Coat of Arms]]
At the time of its foundation in 1586 College began offering higher education in [[Guadalajara]], and as a result it was the first institution that granted academic degrees. The first one who requested to establish a university in Guadalajara was Friar Felipe Galindo y Chavez who, in 1696, asked the King [[Charles II of Spain]] to increase the range of the recently founded Royal Seminary of San Jose. This way, a long century of arrangements to found the '''University of Guadalajara''' began. Chronologically, the second oldest in Mexico, the seventeenth in North America and the fourteenth in Latin America.

The proposition of Friar Felipe was reconsidered by the lawyer Matias Angel de la Mota Padilla, who, in 1750, was able to involve the [[Guadalajara]]'s city hall into the project. However, it was only after the banishment of all Company of Jesus' members from all Spain's territories in 1767, when the need of a university in the region of [[Nueva Galicia]] was relevant. This occurred because the Company of Jesus managed the two most important colleges in the city: the Santo Tomas College and the San Juan Bautista College. Moreover, on December 12, 1771 arrived to Guadalajara the new bishop to [[Nueva Galicia]], Friar Antonio Alcalde y Barriga, who significantly supported the foundation of the University. In 1775 the Friar replied a grit from King [[Charles III of Spain]], who consulted him about the convenience of establishing a university in [[Nueva Galicia]]. The answer of the Friar was completely positive, so on November 18, 1791 the King [[Charles IV of Spain]] enacted a royal grit where he proclaim the foundation of the '''Royal University of Guadalajara'''.

This grit arrived to the authorities in [[Nueva Galicia]] on March 26, 1792, who proceeded to celebrate and quickly revamp the said Santo Tomas College. Therefore, the University was founded on November 3, 1792. By mutual agreement between the Friar Alcalde and the president of the Royal Audience, Jacobo Ugarte de Loyola, Jose Maria Gomez y Villaseñor was named as the first Rector of the University. Academically speaking, the University was first composed by the Art, Theology, Law and Medicine Faculties.

=== The Confrontation between the University of Guadalajara and the Institute of Sciences of the Jalisco State (1821–1861) ===
The University adhered itself to the [[Agustin de Iturbide]]'s [[Plan of Iguala]], with which the [[Mexican War of Independence|Independence of Mexico]] was concluded, as a result the university kept its royal status. However, it came to be imperial when the [[first Mexican Empire]] of Agustin I was proclaimed, but then when the Republic was established it became a national university.

On January 16, 1826, during the administration of Jose Cesareo de la Rosa as the Rector, the [[Jalisco]] State Congress proclaimed the first enclosed order to the '''University of Guadalajara''' and then the State's Governor, Prisciliano Sanchez Padilla, reestablish the Institute of Sciences. However, on September 1, 1834 the State's Governor, José Antonio Romero, declared the first reopening of the University and the closing of the Institute of Sciences. Nevertheless, thirteen years later, in 1847, the State Congress proclaimed the Public Teaching Program by which the '''University of Guadalajara''' as well as the San Juan Bautista College would be closed, furthermore it'd also reestablish the Institute of Sciences and found two high schools, namely the Boys' Lyceum and the Ladies' Lyceum. Yet the Program was not executed since Mariano Hurtado convinced the State's Governor, Joaquin Angulo, not to do so. As a result, in that same year it was proclaimed that the Institute of Sciences and the '''University of Guadalajara''' would coexist, although the later would lose its finances and headquarters. Fortunately, a later State's Governor, Jose Maria Yañez Carillo, proclaimed 1853 the assimilation of the Institute of Sciences into the '''University of Guadalajara''', so the later recovered its traditional patrimony.

At the time the [[Plan of Ayutla]] got the triumph around 1855, the State's Governor, Jose Santos Degollado proclaimed the second enclosed order to the University and the reestablishment of the Institute of Sciences. However, during the [[Reform War]], on February 2, 1859 the Governor and Commander of the [[Jalisco]] State, Leonardo Marquez, reestablish the '''University of Guadalajara'''.

Despite that, following the military success of the liberal wing in 1860, the State's Governor, Pedro Ogazon, proclaimed the third enclosed order to the University which also proclaimed the reestablishment of the Institute of Sciences, the Boys' Lyceum and the Ladies' Lyceum.

=== The University Interregnum (1861–1925) ===
During this period the higher and high school education both came to be totally dominated by the Government of Jalisco which triggered the emergence of private schools. Besides, the Medicine, Law and Engineering Schools, as well as the Boys' Lyceum and the Ladies' Lyceum continued teaching higher and high school education as a result of the governmental support that they received, except from some governors as Ramon Corona and Manuel Macario Dieguez, since the later closed the Lyceums and founded the '''High School of Jalisco''' in 1914.

=== The University of Guadalajara (1925–1989) ===
[[File:Explanada dv.jpg|thumb|University of Guadalajara's General Rectory Building]]
Derived from the worries that many intellectuals and artists manifested in the reunions at the "Centro Bohemio", the conference given by the engineer Juan Salvador Agraz Ramirez de Prado about a project to establish the '''"National University of Guadalajara"''' and the new orientations that the [[Mexican Revolution]] brought about in 1910, the [[Jalisco]] State's Governor, Jose Guadalupe Zuno Hernandez, reopened the '''University of Guadalajara''' by third time in 1925 and named Enrique Diaz de Leon as its Rector. Therefore, the study plans for high schools and faculties, as well as the Organic Law were elaborated and then approved by the State Congress on September 7, 1925. In the first meeting of the University Council the motto of the University was chosen: '''“Piensa y Trabaja" (Think and Work)'''.

In the First Congress of Universities that took place at [[Mexico City]], the Rector Diaz de Leon supported the socialist education, but when he tried to carry it out in [[Guadalajara]], several student's protests happened. As a result of the protests the Governor, Sebastian Allende decided to close the '''University of Guadalajara''' again. However, to prevent the [[Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara|Autonomous University of Guadalajara]] to take the historic name of '''University of Guadalajara''', the State Congress reopened the University and named Constancio Hernandez Alvirde as its twenty ninth Rector.

=== The Jalisco University Network (1989–present) === 
During this period the need to create a modern, efficient, qualified and ecofriendly university was recognized, however, this meant a change in the academic and administrative structure of the university would be necessary. This purposes were established in the Institutional Development Programme: A Future Vision, presented in 1989 by the Rector Raul Padilla Lopez, who is regarded for accomplishing the modernization the University. In this document, the aims and programs of all, teaching, researching and extension areas were established, which were based on a series of projected indicators to 1995.

Additionally, on September 2, 1989 the General University Council approved the document “Bases for the discussion about the Reform of the University of Guadalajara”, which had a current diagnostic about the University and proposed to decentralize the services and functions of the institution all across its entities. Also, some elements as the updating and creation of study plans, the expansion of research and graduate studies, the promotion of cultural and sports activities as well as the diversification of its financial funds were presented in the document. This reform took place when the State Congress approved the new Organic Law of the '''University of Guadalajara'''. In this, the autonomy of the University in matters as the academic planning and the financial administration was acknowledged. In that same year the thematic and regional university campuses were created and the '''High School Education System''' was established.

Moreover, the Labor Union of the Academic Workers of the University of Guadalajara was created and the Labor Union of University Workers got enhanced, the Union of University Students was established as well. Among other changes derived from the creation of the '''University Network''', it is important to mention the creation of the '''Virtual University System''' and the '''University System of Radio, Television and Cinematography'''.

In 2014, with Itzcoatl Tonatiuh Bravo Padilla as the Rector of the University, the Institutional Development Programme was updated with projections to 2030. Besides, the arrangements to build a new regional university campus located in [[Zapotlanejo]], [[Jalisco]] began.  At present the '''University Network''' is located in each region of [[Jalisco]] and has campuses in 109 of 125 municipalities in the State.
