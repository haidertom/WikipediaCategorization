'''2020 Casting''' (now Mad Dog 2020 Casting) is a casting agency based in [[London]], England which supplies extras for film shoots. Previously, it was located in [[Hopgood St]], [[Shepherd's Bush]], in West London. 2020 casting merged with Mad Dog Casting in 2017 to form Mad Dog 2020 Casting and is now based in Ealing Studios.

The agency was founded by actor [[Christopher Villiers]] and personal trainer Richard Smedley who met on the set of the film [[First Knight]] in around 1995. 2020 was "the first agency to take digital photographs of its artistes", and "the first to use text messaging systems to contact our artistes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2020casting.com/pages/background.php Background - Official 2020 website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230110903/http://www.2020casting.com/pages/background.php |date=2012-12-30 }} Retrieved December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Villiers is known for his part in the top rated [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Emmerdale]]'' in which he played the role of the [[solicitor]] [[Grayson Sinclair]].

2020 Casting has a sister agency, SA19&lt;ref&gt;http://www.SA19.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; that is a leading supplier of uniformed supporting artistes to the UK film and television industry.

2020 claims to have 2,600 artistes registered on their books, with a backup database of well over 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2020casting.com/pages/wedo.php What We Do - Official 2020 website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101094300/http://www.2020casting.com/pages/wedo.php |date=2013-01-01 }} Retrieved December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; They have supplied extras for more than 200 films, including [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]], [[Shaun of the Dead]] and [[Bridget Jones's Diary]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/company/co0002463/ Internet Movie Database] Retrieved December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Altarpiece of the Saints John'''''  is a painting by [[Bernat Martorell]] conserved at the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Guide of the Museu Nacional 

d'Art de Catalunya. MNAC, 2004. {{ISBN|84-8043-136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The ''Altarpiece of the Saints John'' from [[Vinaixa]] was commissioned in 1432 from the [[Tarragona]] painter [[Ramon de Mur]], but in the end it was painted by Martorell. The MNAC keeps most of the panels from this altarpiece. The main panel is kept at the [[Museu Diocesà de Tarragona]], a side compartment is kept at the [[Musée Rolin]] d'[[Autun]] ([[France]]), and the whereabouts of another compartment is unknown. The two Saints John feature in the scenes in the lateral lanes of the altarpiece and two more on the predella, respectively. The topmost compartment depicts the Calvary. The predella shows signs of old damage, especially scratches, on figures who were considered negative, such as the executioner (who cuts Saint John's head off), Herod and Herodias (crowned, behind the panel) and the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=47ebcd8e6d370c6926ffc938f57f3dd871295ffedac166160908977bcfde952b?inventoryNumber=064045-CJT  The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Apollo and Marsyas''''' is the title of a 1637 painting by the Spanish artist [[José de Ribera]], now in the [[Royal Museum of Fine Arts of Belgium]]. Other versions are now in the [[Museo di Capodimonte]] and the [[Naples Archaeological Museum]]. They all show the [[Caravaggisti]]'s heavy influence on the artist and depict [[Marsyas]]' flaying by [[Apollo (mythology)|Apollo]].

There are a number of '''books on British railway accidents''' which provide aid in the systematic study of the causes and effects of accidents, and their prevention.  There are common themes in many accidents (see [[Classification of railway accidents|Classification]]). Key books are listed here to avoid repeating them for each individual accident.

The [[doyen]] is [[L. T. C. Rolt]]'s ''Red for Danger'', first published in 1956, which takes a wide-ranging overview of over 100 accidents.  Most other books concentrate on a smaller number of specific accidents, described in more detail.  O.S. Nock's "Historic Railway Disasters" combines both approaches, with individual chapters on especially significant accidents such as [[Armagh rail disaster|Armagh]] and [[Quintinshill rail crash|Quintinshill]].  For accidents in the last 30 years and modern operating practice, Stanley Hall's four books are particularly good.  Apart from Schneider and Mase (1968/1970) and Faith (2001), all the books below are confined to British accidents.

The list below does not include books on individual accidents; for these, see [[Tay Bridge disaster|Tay Bridge]], [[Quintinshill rail crash|Quintinshill]], [[Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash|Harrow]], [[Hixon rail crash|Hixon]], [[Moorgate tube crash|Moorgate]] and [[Lockington rail crash|Lockington]].

An extremely valuable source now on the Internet is the Railways Archive compilation of official Railway Inspectorate Accident Reports - see "External Links" below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1750">'''Cerography''' or '''glyphography''' is a [[printmaking]] technique related to [[engraving]], using a layer of wax over a metal substrate. After the image is engraved into the wax, a positive plate is produced through [[stereotype (printing)|stereotyping]] or [[electrotyping]]. This plate can be used with conventional [[letterpress]] equipment.

The word is derived from the Greek &lt;span title="kêros"&gt;{{lang-grc|κηρός}}&lt;/span&gt;, wax, and &lt;span title="graphein"&gt;{{lang-grc|γράφειν}}&lt;/span&gt;, to write).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Cerography |volume=5 |page=762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cerography was invented in the late 1830s by [[Sidney E. Morse]], a son of [[Jedidiah Morse]], and a younger brother of [[Samuel Morse]]; it was independently patented in England by Edward Palmer, who primarily conceived of it as an artistic medium. Its primary use, however, was for line drawings, and in particular maps. It was easier than copperplate engraving and allowed lines and printed text to be combined easily in a single plate (the text could simply be stamped into the wax). It also allowed for color illustration. As compared to [[lithography]] and copperplate it had the disadvantage that it could not reproduce fine shading well.

The technique remained popular to the end of the 19th century but was gradually pushed out by [[photoengraving]].

They reached their apogee in the period 1150–1250.&lt;ref name="Hasenohr, 242"&gt;Hasenohr, 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

Composed in verse, these narrative poems of moderate length (averaging 4000 lines&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;) were originally sung, or (later) recited, by [[minstrels]] or jongleurs.  More than one hundred ''chansons de geste'' have survived in around three hundred manuscripts&lt;ref name="La Chanson de Roland, 12"&gt;''La Chanson de Roland,'' 12.&lt;/ref&gt; that date from the 12th to the 15th  century.

==Origins==
Since the 19th century, much critical debate has centered on the origins of the ''chansons de geste'', and particularly on explaining the length of time between the composition of the ''chansons'' and the actual historical events which they reference.&lt;ref name="Hasenohr, 239"&gt;Hasenohr, 239.&lt;/ref&gt;  The historical events the ''chansons'' allude to occur in the eighth through tenth centuries, yet the earliest ''chansons'' we have were probably composed at the end of the eleventh century: only three ''chansons de geste'' have a composition that incontestably dates from before 1150: the ''[[Chanson de Guillaume]]'', ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' and ''[[Gormont et Isembart]]'':&lt;ref name="Hasenohr, 239"/&gt; the first half of the ''Chanson de Guillaume'' may date from as early as the eleventh century;&lt;ref&gt;Hasenohr, 520–522.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, 102–104.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gormont et Isembart'' may date from as early as 1068, according to one expert;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Song of Roland'' probably dates from after 1086&lt;ref&gt;''La Chanson de Roland'', 10.&lt;/ref&gt; to c.1100.&lt;ref name="Hasenohr, 239"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hasenohr, 1300.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three early theories of the origin of ''chansons de geste'' believe in the continued existence of epic material (either as lyric poems, epic poems or prose narrations) in these intervening two or three centuries.&lt;ref name="Holmes, 68"&gt;Holmes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics like [[Claude Charles Fauriel]], [[François Raynouard]] and German Romanticists like [[Jacob Grimm]] posited the spontaneous creation of lyric poems by the people as a whole at the time of the historic battles, which were later put together to form the epics.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the basis for the "cantilena" theory of epic origin, which was elaborated by [[Gaston Paris]], although he maintained that single authors, rather than the multitude, were responsible for the songs.&lt;ref name="Holmes, 67"&gt;Holmes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory was also supported by Robert Fawtier and by [[Léon Gautier]] (although Gautier thought the ''cantilenae'' were composed in Germanic languages).&lt;ref name="Holmes, 67"/&gt;  At the end of the nineteenth century, Pio Rajna, seeing similarities between the ''chansons de geste'' and old Germanic/Merovingian tales, posited a Germanic origin for the French poems.&lt;ref name="Holmes, 67"/&gt;  A different theory, introduced by the medievalist [[Paul Meyer (philologist)|Paul Meyer]], suggested the poems were based on old prose narrations of the original events.&lt;ref name="Holmes, 68"/&gt;&lt;ref name="see also Hasenohr, 239"&gt;see also Hasenohr, 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory (largely discredited today&lt;ref name="La Chanson de Roland, 11"&gt;''La Chanson de Roland'', 11.&lt;/ref&gt;), developed by [[Joseph Bédier]], posited that the early ''chansons'' were recent creations, not earlier than the year 1000, developed by singers who, emulating the songs of "saints lives" sung in front of churches (and collaborating with the church clerics&lt;ref name="La Chanson de Roland, 11"/&gt;), created epic stories based on the heroes whose shrines and tombs dotted the great [[pilgrimage]] routes, as a way of drawing pilgrims to these churches.&lt;ref name="Holmes, 68-9"&gt;Holmes, 68-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics have also suggested that knowledge by clerics of ancient Latin epics may have played a role in their composition.&lt;ref name="see also Hasenohr, 239"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes, 68-9"/&gt;

Subsequent criticism has vacillated between "traditionalists" (''chansons'' created as part of a popular tradition) and "individualists" (''chansons'' created by a unique author),&lt;ref name="see also Hasenohr, 239"/&gt; but more recent historical research has done much to fill in gaps in the literary record and complicate the question of origins.  Critics have discovered manuscripts, texts and other traces of the legendary heroes, and further explored the continued existence of a Latin literary tradition (c.f. the scholarship of [[Ernst Robert Curtius]]) in the intervening centuries.&lt;ref&gt;see also Hasenohr, 240.&lt;/ref&gt;  The work of Jean Rychner on the art of the minstrels&lt;ref name="La Chanson de Roland, 11"/&gt; and the work of [[Milman Parry|Parry]] and [[Albert Bates Lord|Lord]] on Yugoslavian oral traditional poetry, Homeric verse and [[Oral-Formulaic Composition|oral composition]] have also been suggested to shed light on the ''oral'' composition of the ''chansons'', although this view is not without its critics&lt;ref name="Hasenohr, 240"&gt;Hasenohr, 240.&lt;/ref&gt; who maintain the importance of ''writing'' not only in the preservation of the texts, but also in their composition, especially for the more sophisticated poems.&lt;ref name="Hasenohr, 240"/&gt;

==Subject matter and structure==
Composed in [[Old French]] and apparently intended for oral performance by [[minstrel|jongleurs]], the ''chansons de geste'' narrate legendary incidents (sometimes based on real events) in the history of [[France]] during the eighth, ninth and tenth centuries, the age of [[Charles Martel]], [[Charlemagne]] and [[Louis the Pious]], with emphasis on their conflicts with the [[Moors]] and [[Saracen]]s, and also disputes between kings and their vassals.

The traditional subject matter of the ''chansons de geste'' became known as the [[Matter of France]]. This distinguished them from [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] concerned with the [[Matter of Britain]], that is, [[King Arthur]] and his [[knight]]s; and with the so-called [[Matter of Rome]], covering the [[Trojan War]], the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]], the life of [[Julius Caesar|Julius Cæsar]] and some of his [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] successors, who were given medieval makeovers as exemplars of [[chivalry]].&lt;ref&gt;This three-way classification of [[mythology]] is set out by the twelfth-century poet [[Jean Bodel]] in the ''[[Chanson de Saisnes]]'': for details see [[Matter of France]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A key theme of the ''chansons de geste'', which set them off from the romances (which tended to explore the role of the "individual"), is their critique and celebration of community/collectivity (their epic heroes are portrayed as figures in the destiny of the nation and Christianity)&lt;ref&gt;''La Chanson de Roland'', 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; and their representation of the complexities of feudal relations and service.

The subject matter of the ''chansons'' evolved over time, according to public taste.  Alongside the great battles and scenes of historic prowess of the early ''chansons'' there began to appear other themes.  Realistic elements (money, urban scenes) and elements from the new court culture (female characters, the role of love) began to appear.&lt;ref name="Hasenohr, 242"/&gt;  Other [[fantasy]] and adventure elements, derived from the romances, were gradually added:&lt;ref name="Hasenohr, 242"/&gt; [[giant (mythology)|giants]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[monster]]s increasingly appear among the foes along with [[Islam|Muslims]].  There is also an increasing dose of Eastern adventure, drawing on contemporary experiences in the [[Crusades]]; in addition, one series of ''chansons'' retells the events of the [[First Crusade]] and the first years of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].  The conflicts of the 14th century ([[Hundred Years' War]]) brought a renewed epic spirit and nationalistic (or propagandistic&lt;ref&gt;Hasenohr, 242&lt;/ref&gt;) fervor to some ''chansons de geste'' (such as ''La Chanson de [[Hugues Capet]]'').&lt;ref name="Adam, 45"&gt;Adam, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poems contain an assortment of [[fictional character|character types]]; the repertoire of valiant hero, brave traitor, shifty or cowardly traitor, [[Saracen]] giant, beautiful Saracen princess, and so forth.  As the genre matured, fantasy elements were introduced.  Some of the characters that were devised by the poets in this manner include the [[fairy]] [[Oberon (Fairy King)|Oberon]], who made his literary debut in ''[[Huon de Bordeaux]]''; and the magic [[horse]] [[Bayard (legend)|Bayard]], who first appears in ''[[Renaud de Montauban]]''. Quite soon an element of self-[[parody]] appears; even the august Charlemagne was not above gentle mockery in the ''[[Pèlerinage de Charlemagne]]''.

The [[narrative structure]] of the ''chanson de geste'' has been compared to the one in the [[Nibelungenlied]] and in [[creole language|creole]] [[legend]]s by [[Henri Wittmann]]&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann, Henri. 1995. "La structure de base de la syntaxe narrative dans les contes et légendes du créole haïtien." ''Poétiques et imaginaires: francopolyphonie littéraire des Amériques''. Edited by Pierre Laurette &amp; Hans-George Ruprecht. Paris: L'Harmattan, pp. 207–218.[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1995b-narr.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of common [[narreme]] structure as first developed in the work of [[Eugene Dorfman]]&lt;ref&gt;Dorfman,  Eugène.  1969.  ''The narreme in the medieval romance epic:  An introduction to narrative structures''.  Toronto:  University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean-Pierre Tusseau]]&lt;ref&gt;*Tusseau, Jean-Pierre &amp; Henri Wittmann.  1975.  "Règles de narration dans les chansons de geste et le roman courtois".  ''Folia linguistica'' 7.401-12.[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1975e-narremesOF.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versification==
Early ''chansons de geste'' were typically composed in [[decasyllable|ten-syllable]] lines grouped in [[assonance]]d (meaning that the last stressed vowel is the same in each line throughout the stanza, but the last consonant differs from line to line) [[stanza]]s (called ''[[laisse]]s''). These stanzas are of variable length.

An example from the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'' illustrates the technique of the ten-syllable assonanced form. The assonance in this stanza is on '''e''':
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|fr|Desuz un pin, delez un eglanter
Un faldestoed i unt, fait tout d'or mer:
La siet li reis ki dulce France tient.
Blanche ad la barbe et tut flurit le chef,
Gent ad le cors et le cuntenant fier.
S'est kil demandet, ne l'estoet enseigner.}}
|
Under a pine tree, by a rosebush,
there is a throne made entirely of gold.
There sits the king who rules sweet France;
his beard is white, with a full head of hair.
He is noble in carriage, and proud of bearing.
If anyone is looking for the King, he doesn't need to be pointed out.}}

Later ''chansons'' were composed in monorhyme stanzas, in which the last syllable of each line rhymes fully throughout the stanza.  Later ''chansons'' also tended to be composed using [[French alexandrine|alexandrine]]s (twelve-syllable) lines, instead of ten-syllable lines (some early ''chansons'', such as ''[[Girart de Vienne]]'', were even adapted into a twelve-syllable version).

The following example of the twelve-syllable rhymed form is from the opening lines of ''[[Les Chétifs]]'', a ''chanson'' in the [[Crusade cycle]]. The rhyme is on '''ie''':
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|fr|Or s'en fuit Corbarans tos les plains de Surie,
N'enmaine que .ii. rois ens en sa conpaignie.
S'enporte Brohadas, fis Soudan de Persie;
En l'estor l'avoit mort a l'espee forbie
Li bons dus Godefrois a le chiere hardie
Tres devant Anthioce ens en la prairie.}}
|
So Corbaran escaped across the plains of Syria;
He took only two kings in his company.
He carried away Brohadas, son of the Sultan of Persia,
Who had been killed in the battle by the clean sword
Of the brave-spirited good duke Godfrey
Right in front of Antioch, down in the meadow.}}

These forms of versification were substantially different than the forms found in the Old French verse [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] (''romans'') which were written in [[octosyllable|octosyllabic]] [[rhyme]]d [[couplet]]s.

==Composition and performance==
The public of the ''chansons de geste''—the lay (secular) public of the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries—was largely [[literacy|illiterate]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''La Chanson de Roland'', 12.&lt;/ref&gt; except for (at least to the end of the 12th century) members of the great courts and (in the south) smaller noble families.&lt;ref&gt;Bumke, 429.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the ''chansons'' were primarily an oral medium.

Opinions vary greatly on whether the early ''chansons'' were first written down and then read from manuscripts (although [[parchment]] was quite expensive&lt;ref name="La Chanson de Roland, 14"&gt;''La Chanson de Roland'', 14.&lt;/ref&gt;)  or memorized for performance,&lt;ref name="Bumke, 521-2"&gt;Bumke, 521-2.&lt;/ref&gt; or whether portions were improvised,&lt;ref name="La Chanson de Roland, 14"/&gt; or whether they were entirely the product of spontaneous [[Oral-Formulaic Composition|oral composition]] and later written down.  Similarly, scholars differ greatly on the social condition and literacy of the poets themselves; were they cultured [[cleric]]s or illiterate jongleurs working within an oral tradition?  As an indication of the role played by orality in the tradition of the ''chanson de geste'', lines and sometimes whole stanzas, especially in the earlier examples, are noticeably [[Oral poetry|formulaic]] in nature, making it possible both for the poet to construct a poem in performance and for the audience to grasp a new theme with ease.

Scholarly opinions differ on the exact manner of recitation, but it is generally believed that the ''chansons de geste'' were originally sung (whereas the medieval romances were probably spoken)&lt;ref name="Bumke, 521-2"/&gt; by poets, [[minstrel]]s or jongleurs, who would sometimes accompany themselves, or be accompanied, on the ''[[vielle]]'', a mediæval [[fiddle]] played with a bow. Several manuscript texts include lines in which the jongleur demands attention, threatens to stop singing, promises to continue the next day, and asks for money or gifts.&lt;ref name="La Chanson de Roland, 14"/&gt;  By the middle of the 13th century, singing had probably given way to recitation.&lt;ref name="Hasenohr, 242"/&gt;

It has been calculated that a reciter could sing about a thousand verses an hour&lt;ref name="Bumke, 522"&gt;Bumke, 522.&lt;/ref&gt; and probably limited himself to 1000–1300 verses by performance,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; making it likely that the performance of works extended over several days.&lt;ref name="Bumke, 522"/&gt; Given that many ''chansons'' from the late twelfth century on extended to over 10,000 verses or more (for example, ''[[Aspremont (chanson de geste)|Aspremont]]'' comprises 11,376 verses, while ''[[Quatre Fils Aymon]]'' comprises 18,489 verses), it is conceivable that few spectators heard the longest works in their entirety.&lt;ref&gt;see Bumke, 522.&lt;/ref&gt;

While poems like ''The Song of Roland'' were sometimes heard in public squares and were no doubt warmly received by a broad public,&lt;ref&gt;Brault, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; some critics caution that the ''chansons'' should probably not be characterized as popular literature&lt;ref&gt;Brault, 353 (note 166).&lt;/ref&gt; and some ''chansons'' appear particularly tailored for an audience of aristocratic, privileged or warrior classes.&lt;ref&gt;see Brault, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The poems themselves==
More than one hundred ''chansons de geste'' have survived in around three hundred manuscripts&lt;ref name="La Chanson de Roland, 12"/&gt; that date from the 12th to the 15th  century.  Several popular ''chansons'' were written down more than once in varying forms. The earliest ''chansons'' are all (more or less) anonymous; many later ones have named authors.

By the middle of the 12th century, the corpus of works was being expanded principally by "cyclisation", that is to say by the formation of "cycles" of ''chansons'' attached to a character or group of characters—with new ''chansons'' being added to the ensemble by singing of the earlier or later adventures of the hero, of their youthful exploits ("enfances"), the great deeds of their ancestors or descendants, or their retreat from the world to a convent ("moniage") – or attached to an event (like the Crusades).&lt;ref&gt;Adam, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

About 1215 [[Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube]], in the introductory lines to his ''Girart de Vienne'', subdivided the Matter of France, the usual subject area of the ''chansons de geste'', into three [[literature cycle|cycle]]s, which revolved around three main characters (see quotation at [[Matter of France]]). There are several other less formal lists of ''chansons'', or of the legends they incorporate. One can be found in the [[fabliau]] entitled ''Des Deux Bordeors Ribauz'', a humorous tale of the second half of the 13th century, in which a jongleur lists the stories he knows.&lt;ref&gt;''Recueil général et complet des fabliaux'' ed. A. de Montaiglon (1872) vol. 1 p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Another is included by the Catalan troubadour [[Guiraut de Cabrera]] in his humorous poem ''[[Ensenhamen]]'', better known from its first words as ''"Cabra juglar"'': this is addressed to a ''juglar'' (jongleur) and purports to instruct him on the poems he ought to know but doesn't.&lt;ref&gt;Martín de Riquer, Los cantares de gesta franceses (1952) pp. 390–404&lt;/ref&gt;

The listing below is arranged according to Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube's cycles, extended with two additional groupings and with a final list of ''chansons'' that fit into no cycle. There are numerous differences of opinion about the categorization of individual ''chansons''.

===''Geste du roi''===
The chief character is usually Charlemagne or one of his immediate successors. A pervasive theme is the King's role as champion of Christianity.  This cycle contains the first of the ''chansons'' to be written down, the ''Chanson de Roland'' or "[[The Song of Roland]]".

===''Geste de Doon de Mayence''===
{{main|Doon de Mayence}}
This cycle concerns [[traitor]]s and rebels against royal authority. In each case the revolt ends with the defeat of the rebels and their eventual repentance.

* ''[[Gormond et Isembart]]''
* ''[[Girart de Roussillon]]'' (1160–1170). The hero Girart de Roussillon also figures in ''Girart de Vienne'', in which he is identified as a son of Garin de Monglane. There is a later sequel:

** ''[[Aye d'Avignon]]'', probably composed between 1195 and 1205. The fictional heroine is first married to Garnier de Nanteuil, who is son of Doon de Nanteuil and grandson of Doon de Mayence. After Garnier's death she marries the Saracen Ganor
** ''[[Gui de Nanteuil]]'', evidently popular around 1207 when the troubadour [[Raimbaut de Vaqueiras]] mentions the story. The fictional hero is son of the heroine of ''Aye d'Avignon'' (to which ''Gui de Nanteuil'' forms a sequel)
** ''[[Tristan de Nanteuil]]''. The fictional hero is son of the hero of ''Gui de Nanteuil''
** ''[[Parise la Duchesse]]''. The fictional heroine is daughter of the heroine of Aye d'Avignon. Exiled from France, she gives birth to a son, Hugues, who becomes king of Hungary&lt;ref&gt;''Parise la Duchesse'' ed. G. F. de Martonne (1836); ''Parise la Duchesse'' ed. F. Guessard, L.

* ''[[Garin le Loherain]]''
* ''[[Hervis de Metz]]''
* ''[[Gerbert de Metz]]''
* ''[[Anseïs fils de Girbert]]''

===Crusade cycle===
{{main|Crusade cycle}}

* ''[[Les Chétifs]]'' telling the adventures (mostly fictional) of the poor crusaders led by [[Peter the Hermit]]; the hero is Harpin de Bourges. The episode was eventually incorporated, c. 1180, by Graindor de Douai in his reworking of the ''Chanson d'Antioche''
* ''[[Matabrune]]'' tells the story of old Matabrune and of the great-grandfather of Godefroi de Bouillon
* ''[[Le Chevalier au Cigne]]'' tells the story of Elias, grandfather of Godefroi de Bouillon. Originally composed around 1192, it was afterwards extended and divided into several ''branches''
* ''[[Les Enfances Godefroi]]'' or "Childhood exploits of Godefroi" tells the story of the youth of Godefroi de Bouillon and his three brothers
* ''[[Chanson de Jérusalem]]''
* ''[[La Mort de Godefroi de Bouillon]]'', quite unhistorical, narrates Godefroi's poisoning by the Patriarch of Jerusalem
* ''[[Baudouin de Sebourc]]'' (mid-14th century)

* ''[[Aigar et Maurin]]''
* ''[[Aïmer le Chétif]]'', a lost ''chanson''&lt;ref&gt;R. Weeks, "Aïmer le chétif" in ''PMLA'' vol. 17 (1902) pp. 411–434.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Aiol]]'' (13th century)&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Jacques Normand and Gaston Raynaud. Paris, 1877.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Théséus de Cologne]]'', possibly a romance

The ''chansons de geste'' reached their apogee in the period 1150–1250.&lt;ref name="Hasenohr, 242"/&gt; By the middle of the 13th century, public taste in France had begun to abandon these epics, preferring, rather, the romances.&lt;ref name="Adam, 38"&gt;Adam, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the genre progressed in the middle of the 13th century, only certain traits (like versification, ''laisse'' structure, formulaic forms, setting, and other clichés of the genre) remained to set the ''chansons'' apart from the romances.&lt;ref name="Adam, 38"/&gt;  The 15th century saw the cycles of ''chansons'' (along with other chronicles) converted into large prose compilations (such as the compilation made by [[David Aubert]]).&lt;ref name="Adam, 45"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haseonohr, 243"&gt;Haseonohr, 243.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, the themes of the epics continued to exert an influence through the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Haseonohr, 243"/&gt;

==Legacy and adaptations==
The ''chansons de geste'' created a body of [[mythology]] that lived on well after they ceased to be produced in France.

The French ''chanson'' gave rise to the [[Old Spanish]] tradition of the ''[[cantar de gesta]]''.

The ''chanson de geste'' was also adapted in southern ([[Occitan language|Occitan-speaking]]) France.  One of the three surviving manuscripts of the ''chanson'' [[Girart de Roussillon]] (12th century) is in Occitan,&lt;ref&gt;Hasenohr, 547.&lt;/ref&gt; as are two works based on the story of Charlemagne and Roland, ''[[Rollan a Saragossa]]''&lt;ref&gt;Hasenohr, 1305.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Ronsasvals]]'' (early 12th century).&lt;ref&gt;Hasenohr, 1320.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''chanson de geste'' form was also used in such Occitan texts as ''[[Canso d'Antioca]]'' (late 12th century), ''[[Daurel e Betó]]'' (first half of the 13th century), and ''[[Song of the Albigensian Crusade]]'' (c.1275) (cf [[Occitan literature]]).

In medieval Germany, the ''chansons de geste'' elicited little interest from the German courtly audience, unlike the romances which were much appreciated.  While ''The Song of Roland'' was among the first French epics to be translated into German (by [[Konrad der Pfaffe]] as the ''[[Rolandslied]]'', c.1170), and the German poet [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] based his (incomplete) 13th century epic ''Willehalm'' (consisting of seventy-eight manuscripts) on the ''[[Aliscans]]'', a work in the cycle of [[William of Gellone|William of Orange]] (Eschenbach's work had a great success in Germany), these remained isolated examples.  Other than a few other works translated from the cycle of Charlemagne in the 13th century, the ''chansons de geste'' were not adapted into German, and it is believed that this was because the epic poems lacked what the romances specialized in portraying: scenes of idealized knighthood, love and courtly society.&lt;ref&gt;Bumke, 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 13th century, certain French ''chansons de geste'' were adapted into the [[Old Norse]] ''[[Karlamagnús saga]]''.

In Italy, there exist several 14th-century texts in verse or prose which recount the feats of Charlemagne in Spain, including a ''chanson de geste'' in Franco-Venetian, the ''[[Entrée d'Espagne]]'' (c.1320)&lt;ref&gt;Hasenohr. Article: "Entrée d'Espagne", pp. 412–3.&lt;/ref&gt; (notable for transforming the character of Roland into a [[knight errant]], similar to heroes from the Arthurian romances&lt;ref&gt;Brand, 168.&lt;/ref&gt;), and a similar Italian epic ''[[La Spagna]]'' (1350–1360) in [[ottava rima]].  Through such works, the "Matter of France" became an important source of material (albeit significantly transformed) in Italian romantic epics.  ''[[Morgante]]'' (c.1483) by [[Luigi Pulci]], ''[[Orlando innamorato]]'' (1495) by [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]], ''[[Orlando furioso]]'' (1516) by [[Ludovico Ariosto]], and ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'' (1581) by [[Torquato Tasso]] are all indebted to the French narrative material (the Pulci, Boiardo and Ariosto poems are founded on the legends of the paladins of Charlemagne, and particularly, of Roland, translated as "Orlando").

The incidents and plot devices of the Italian epics later became central to works of English literature such as [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]''; Spenser attempted to adapt the form devised to tell the tale of the triumph of [[Christianity]] over [[Islam]] to tell instead of the triumph of [[Protestantism]] over [[Roman Catholicism]].

The Welsh poet, painter, soldier and engraver [[David Jones (artist-poet)|David Jones]]'s Modernist poem [[In Parenthesis]] was described by contemporary critic [[Herbert Read]] as having "the heroic ring which we associate with the old chansons de geste".

Two [[opera|grand opera]] companies in Chicago have gone by the name '''Chicago Grand Opera Company'''

The first Chicago Grand Opera Company produced four seasons of opera in Chicago's [[Auditorium Building|Auditorium Theater]] from the Fall of 1910 through November 1915.  It was the first resident Chicago opera company. The company also spent several months each year performing in the city of Philadelphia where it performed at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia Metropolitan Opera House]] under the name the '''Philadelphia-Chicago Grand Opera Company''' in order to "satisfy the civic pride" of that city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1911/03/08/archives/article-20-no-title.html Special to the New York Times], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 8, 1911&lt;/ref&gt; The company notably presented the world premieres of [[Victor Herbert]]'s ''[[Natoma (opera)|Natoma]]'' (1911) and [[Attilio Parelli]]'s ''[[I dispettosi amanti]]'' (1912). The company also mounted the United States premieres of [[Jean Nouguès]]'s ''[[Quo vadis (opera)|Quo vadis]]'' (1911), [[Karl Goldmark]]'s ''[[Das Heimchen am Herd]]'' (1912),  and [[Alberto Franchetti]]'s ''[[Cristoforo Colombo (opera)|Cristoforo Colombo]]'' (1913). Notable performers who sang with the company included [[Paul Althouse]], [[Marguerite Bériza]], [[Alfredo Costa]], [[Armand Crabbé]], [[Charles Dalmorès]], [[Enrica Clay Dillon]], [[Jenny Dufau]], [[Hector Dufranne]], [[Minnie Egener]], [[Amy Evans]], [[Mary Garden]], [[Jeanne Gerville-Réache]], [[Orville Harrold]], [[Gustave Huberdeau]], [[Frances Ingram]], [[Lydia Lipkowska]], [[Vanni Marcoux]], [[Carmen Melis]], [[Lucien Muratore]], [[Giovanni Polese]], [[Albert Reiss]], [[Myrna Sharlow]], [[Tarquinia Tarquini]], [[Luisa Tetrazzini]], [[Alice Zeppilli]], and [[Nicola Zerola]] among others.

The second Chicago Grand Opera Company was an attempt to keep opera going in Chicago after the collapse of the [[Chicago Civic Opera]] in 1932.  It produced three seasons of opera at the [[Civic Opera House]] from 1933 to 1935 before it too succumbed to financial difficulties.  It was succeeded by the [[Chicago City Opera Company]].

'''Christ taking leave of his Mother''' is a subject in [[Christian art]], most commonly found in Northern art of the 15th and 16th centuries. Christ says farewell to his mother [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], often blessing her, before leaving for his [[Palm Sunday|final journey]] to [[Jerusalem]], which he knows will lead to his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] and death; indeed this scene marks the beginning of his Passion.&lt;ref&gt;John Oliver Hand, Catherine A. Metzger, Ron Spronk: ''Prayers and Portraits: Unfolding the Netherlandish Diptych'', p.66, 2006, Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-12155-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early versions just these two figures are usually shown, at half-length or less.

After [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]] the subject usually has a landscape setting and includes attendants (usually the [[Three Marys]]) to Mary, who often [[Swoon of the Virgin|swoons with distress]] and is held by them. Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[John the Evangelist]], [[Mary Magdalen]] and other apostles may be shown. It is probably more common in [[old master print|prints]] than paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, Erica, ''The National Gallery companion guide'',pp. 102-3. 1997 revised edition, National Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-85709-218-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject does not illustrate any Biblical passage, but derives from one of the [[Pseudo-Bonaventura]]'s "Meditations on the life of Christ" (1308), and the "Marienleben" ({{Language with name/for|2=German|3="[[Life of the Virgin]]"}}; about 1300) of {{ill|Philipp von Seitz|de}}, also known as ''Bruder Philipp, der Kartäuser'' ({{Language with name/for|2=German|3=''[[Brother (Christian)|Brother]] Philipp, the [[Carthusian]]''}}).&lt;ref&gt;The National Gallery, ''Complete Illustrated Catalogue'', National Gallery Publications, p.2, 1995, {{ISBN|1-85709-050-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-gewi.kfunigraz.ac.at/stlitma/autor/pvs_marienleben.html |title=Steirische Literatur im Mittelalter &amp;#124; Philipp v.

[http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/viewOneZoom.asp?dep=11&amp;viewmode=1&amp;item=14.40.636&amp;zoomFlag=0 MMA, New York] - the other wing of this is in England. See Hand, Metzer &amp; Spronk op &amp; page cit., an exhibition catalogue entry for the Basel work.&lt;/ref&gt; many lesser artists were painting the subject by then, especially in Germany.

Awareness of the subject was further spread by prints, by [[Albrecht Dürer]] in his very popular [[woodcut]] series the on the [[Life of the Virgin]] (ca. 1505),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galleries.bc.ca/kelowna/1999/images/virgin17.jpg Image] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705215328/http://www.galleries.bc.ca/kelowna/1999/images/virgin17.jpg |date=July 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in his woodcut ''Passion'' series (1509), and also by [[Lucas van Leyden]].  As was by then often the case, many provincial painters used the compositions of the prints directly as a basis for their paintings, for example a version from his eponymous [[altarpiece]] by the Nuremberg painter known as the "Master of the Schwabach Altarpiece"(1506, [[Compton Verney House]]), who uses his fellow-townsman Dürer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comptonverney.org.uk/?page=collections/german/schwabachChrist.html Compton Verney website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first third of the 16th century was the period of peak popularity for the subject;&lt;ref&gt;It will be noted that most of the works mentioned here date very close to 1520.&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Danube School]] in particular the opportunities for expressiveness and a landscape background made the subject attractive.  Versions include very intense ones by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG6463 National Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wolf Huber]] (both about 1520 and in the [[National Gallery, London]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG6550 National Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; The Huber is a cut-down fragment with just the group around the Virgin, and Christ's arm coming in from the right. Both of these works have a lush forest background, a [[Swoon of the Virgin|swooning Virgin]], and show the female figures in largely contemporary dress.&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, Erica, ''The National Gallery companion guide'', pp. 102-3 and 334-6, 1997 revised edition, National Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-85709-218-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest of the few Italian depictions, an early [[Correggio]] of about 1514 ([[National Gallery, London]]) clearly (under [[x-rays]]) used Dürer's composition as a starting point, before changing it around.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cecil Gould|Gould, Cecil]], ''The Sixteenth Century Italian Schools'', National Gallery Catalogues, London 1975, {{ISBN|0-947645-22-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lorenzo Lotto]] (1521, [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]) also painted the subject, and there is a [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] (ca 1520) in Vienna.  After 1550 the subject is seen less often, though the [[Pitti Palace]] has a work that is at least from the school of [[Paolo Veronese]].

'''Counter-''Maniera''''' or '''Counter-Mannerism''' (variously capitalized and part-italicized) is a term in art history for a trend identified by some art historians in 16th-century Italian painting that forms a sub-category or phase of [[Mannerism]], the dominant movement in Italian art between about 1530 and 1590.  Counter-''Maniera'' or Counter-Mannerism reacted against the artificiality of the second generation of Mannerist painters in the second half of the 16th century. It was in part due to artists wishing to follow the [[The_Reformation_and_art#Council_of_Trent|vague prescriptions for clarity and simplicity]] in art issued by the [[Council of Trent]] in its final session in 1563, and represented a rejection of the distortions and artificiality of high Mannerist style, and a partial return to the classicism and balance of [[High Renaissance]] art, with "clarity in formal order and legibility in content".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429; his longest passage explaining his term is on pp. 429–430&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was devised by the art historian [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg]] (1914–1997), and has gained a good degree of acceptance, although it is by no means universally adopted by other art historians.  Counter-Maniera was one of the four phases of 16th-century Italian painting defined by Freedberg in his ''Painting in Italy, 1500–1600'', first published in 1971 and long the standard textbook on the period, as: "First ''Maniera'', High ''Maniera'', Counter-''Maniera'' and Late ''Maniera''".&lt;ref&gt;Cropper, 17; Freedberg had used the terms in earlier articles.&lt;/ref&gt; The styles did not neatly succeed each other but existed side by side for much of the time, with High ''Maniera'' remaining the dominant style during the main period of Counter-''Maniera'' in the third quarter of the 16th century. In many cases Counter-Mannerism was a development of an artist's style in mid or late career, or a style used for some works, especially religious commissions, while other works by the same artist continued to use a high ''maniera'' style.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429–430&lt;/ref&gt; 

Freedberg's contemporary [[Federico Zeri]] had in 1957 introduced or revived his own term ''arte sacra'' ("sacred art") for pre-Baroque Counter-Reformation style in Roman painting, overlapping to a large degree with Freedberg's Counter-Maniera, though rather wider in both the dates and styles included. The use of the term Counter-''Maniera'' may be in decline, as impatience with such "[[Style (visual arts)|style]] labels" grows among art historians. In 2000 Marcia B. Hall, a leading art historian of the period and mentee of Freedberg, was criticised by a reviewer of her ''After Raphael: Painting in Central Italy in the Sixteenth Century'' for her "fundamental flaw" in continuing to use this and other terms, despite an apologetic "Note on style labels" at the beginning of the book and a promise to keep their use to a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, 324&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope and characteristics==
The definition of Mannerism itself is notoriously complex,&lt;ref&gt;The subject of both Cropper and Smyth, and Shearman's Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; and that of Counter-Mannerism, which to a considerable extent is defined negatively or reductively against it, is no less so.  Many parts of Italy, led by [[Venice]] and other northern centres, were on the periphery of both the High Renaissance and the Mannerist reaction, and reached what might be called a Counter-Mannerist style merely by continuing to develop regional Renaissance styles, and accepting moderate doses of ''maniera'' influence.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 563, and many passages on specific artists&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most often applied to painters in Florence and Rome who reacted against the prevailing style in these centres of full-blooded ''maniera'', without a fundamental rejection of its underlying principles. In proposing the term Freedberg compares it with terms such as "counterpart" and "[[counterpoint]]", explaining that he intends "implying parallelism and relation between two terms at the same time as their opposition".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429 quoted, and ''passim'' on individual artists; Friedländer, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; 

Characteristics of the ''maniera'' often retained in counter-''maniera'' works, though in moderation, are an idealized and abstracted treatment of the content, absence of naturalism, an avoidance of the expression of emotion, and many of the formal characteristics noted by Friedländer, such as the arrangement of figures on the same plane at the front of the picture space, which they nearly fill. Elements of the ''maniera'' that are removed include the impulse to push to the extreme, the willingness to sacrifice everything for a graceful effect, playfulness and wit, and the readiness to let the details and ambience of a painting crowd out or submerge the supposed main figures, that must be hunted out by the learned viewer. The style restores a [[decorum]] suitable for religious works, and removes distractions from the central religious figures.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429; Shearman, 168–169, 178–179; Friedländer, 6–10, and Part 1 generally&lt;/ref&gt; In its latest phase, from about 1585, the need for popular appeal appears to have been recognized by artists and commissioners in the church, leading to some relaxation of the austerity of earlier periods, and sometimes to sentimentality.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 657–660&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term counter-''maniera'' is not usually applied to the more radical [[Bologna|Bolognese]] reaction of the [[Carracci family|Carraccis]] from the 1580s, although this represented a more effective rejection of Mannerist artificiality. For Freedberg this was "a new and un-Maniera attitude to art";&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 566; Shearman, 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; elsewhere he cautions against confusing Counter-''Maniera'' with "anti-Maniera", apparently reflecting "Anti-Mannerism", the term used by [[Walter Friedländer]] for the "palpable break in the stylistic development of Italian painting" that occurred "sometime around 1590".&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, Part II, p. 47 quoted; Freedberg 606; for more on the "anti-Maniera" of [[Antonio Campi]] see 585–587, and for that of [[Scipione Pulzone]] see 658, and "non-Maniera" is also used; &lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term has not been extended to [[Northern Mannerism]].

Deciding what characterizes a work in Counter-Mannerist style may not be straightforward; in the single brief passage mentioning the term in [[John Shearman]]'s ''Mannerism'' (1967), he picks [[Santi di Tito]]'s ''Vision of St Thomas Aquinas'' (1593, illustrated here, as in both books) as an example of it, but Freedberg excludes Santo's classicising naturalism from the style, though noting his similarities to it.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 178; Freedberg, 624&lt;/ref&gt; Shearman's other main example of Counter-Mannerism is [[Federigo Barocci]], who Freedberg also excludes from his definition.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 178; Freedberg, 632–640&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Many painters looked to revive the styles of [[Raphael]], [[Andrea del Sarto]] and other High Renaissance masters, or drew inspiration from the Venetian masters of the High Renaissance. The example of [[Michelangelo]]'s late work was important for many artists.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 428–429&lt;/ref&gt; The Florentine biographer and critic [[Raffaello Borghini]], author of ''Il Riposo della Pitura e della Scultura'' published in 1584, has been proposed as a theorist, rather late into the course of the trend,&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, "Conclusion"; Borghini is not mentioned by Freedberg&lt;/ref&gt; but his work is little known. The artists of Counter-Mannerism remain relatively unknown,&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; and often hard to see outside Italy, as much of their work was religious and remains in the churches for which it was commissioned, or Italian museums. It was mostly ignored in the hunt by picture dealers in the 18th and 19th centuries. Freedberg says frankly: "Boredom is a requisite of the Roman Counter-Maniera style, invading even the art of the few painters whose inspiration may be too considerable and too authentic to be sealed off wholly".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 499, when discussing [[Girolamo Muziano]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedberg cautions against treating the style as simply a reflection of the decrees of Trent, which were a last minute and little-discussed addition, based on a French draft, to the final session in 1563, well after the style had begun to show itself. He describes the decrees as "a codifying and official sanction of a temper that had come to be conspicuous in Roman culture".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 427–428, 427 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that Freedberg, like the majority of art historians dealing with the period—even today—tended to view mid-to-late sixteenth-century and early seventeenth-century Italian art history through the singular pro-Roman Bolognese lens of [[Gian Pietro Bellori]]'s ''Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects'' - meaning Freedburg may have had little time for any alternative historical narrative that did not support a "pro-Bolognese" artistic account of Counter-''Maniera'' reform.&lt;ref&gt;Giovan Pietro Bellori, The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architect: A New Translation and Critical Edition, ed. Alice Sedgwick Wohl, Helmut Wohl and Tomaso Montanari (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8284">The '''dance and theatre of Laos''' (nattakam Lao, Lao: ນາດຕະກັມລາວ {{IPA-lo|nâːt táʔ kam láːw|}}) is the primary [[drama]]tic art form of [[Laos]]' majority ethnic group, the Lao people. It is shared with the ethnic Lao that inhabit the [[Isan]] region of Thailand as well. There are mainly two types of dances (or dance-dramas), the classical dances performed in the royal courts and the folk dances now associated with [[morlam]].&lt;ref name="Laos. 2001"&gt;''Laos.'' (2001). Rubin, D., Pong C. S., Caturvedi, R., ''et al'' (ed.) ''World encyclopedia of contemporary theatre: Asia/Pacific.'' (Vol. III). New York, NY: Routlegde.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shadow puppetry, although not associated with dance, is an important part of Lao theatrical traditions. Various dance-drama troupes, mostly operating out of [[Louang Phrabang]] and [[Vientiane]], continue to teach the old classical court dances and more [[Khmer people|Khmer]]-influenced dramas and folk dances, respectively.&lt;ref name="Laos. 2001"/&gt;

==Classical dance and theatre==
The dance-dramas of Laos were originally only performed for the royal court. The dance-dramas and musical accompaniment are all very similar to those of Thai and [[Khmer classical dance|Cambodian]] classical dances. Lao legends of the first ruler of Lan Xang say that in addition to a large army of Khmer soldiers, he was also accompanied by many female dancers from the court of Angkor.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, N. (2007). ''Vietnam, cambodia, laos and the greater mekong.'' Oakland, California: Lonely Planet Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most dance dramas depict scenes from the [[Phra Lak Phra Lam|Phra Lak Phra Ram]] (ພຣະລັກພຣະຣາມ {{IPA-lo|pʰāʔ lāk pʰāʔ láːm|}}), or the Lao [[Ramayana]] and the ''Sadok'' (ຊາດົກ {{IPA|[sáː dók]}}), or [[Jataka]]. Other scenes come from legends, historical epics such as [[Sang Sinxay|Sin Xay]] , stories from local or Hindu mythology, or adaptations of stories from surrounding nations. Lao classical dance has two main forms, khone and lakhone. Each is accompanied by Lao classical music.

[[File:Lao New Year, dancers.jpg|250px|thumb|Masked dancers about to perform a ''khon'' dance-drama based on the Phra Lak Phra Ram.]]
''Khon'' (ໂຂນ {{IPA|[kʰǒːn]}}) is the most stylised of the [[Lao people|Lao]] dance-dramas, with troupes of male and female dancers in elaborate costumes and masks performing very graceful movements demonstrating their great flexibility, and very common dance-drama form for the Phra Lak Phra Ram. Each dancer plays a character in the drama, although most of the narration comes from a singing [[choir|chorus]] to the side. Lakhone (ລະຄອນ {{IPA|[lāʔ kʰɔ́ːn]}}) dances are usually only performed by females, but male lakhone dancers are not unknown. Instead of each dancer portraying an individual character, such as the ''Khon'' dance-dramas, the dancers mimic the scene and events together. There is more variety of dance-dramas performed in the Lakhon tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, J. R. (1993). ''The cambridge guide to asian theatre.'' Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although lacking in dance, ''nang taloung'' or shadow puppets (ໜັງຕະລຸງ {{IPA|[nǎŋ táʔ lúŋ]}}) are an important part of Lao theatrical traditions. An adaptation of the traditional Malay [[wayang]] shadow puppets, but there are numerous puppeteers instead of one puppet master. Shadow puppet plays are based on similar themes and stories as the other classical dramas, but can be accompanied by either classical music or [[morlam]] instrumentation.&lt;ref&gt;B., Rachel, Lam, M. B., Cullen, A. ''et al'' (2007). ''World and its peoples: eastern and southern asia.'' Tarrytown, NY: Marshall Cavendish Corp.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lam lao==
{{main|morlam}}

[[File:Lao morlam musiciens.jpg|right|thumb|A khene player and Lao dancers at a morlam performance in France.]]
Lam Lao (ລຳລາວ) or [[morlam]] (ໝໍລຳ {{IPA|[mɔ̌ː lám]}}) is the general descriptor for Lao folk music, which at its most basic level consists of the singer/story-teller and the khene (ແຄນ {{IPA|[kʰɛ́ːn]}}). In Isan, both terms are interchangeable, but in Laos, ''morlam'' only refers to the singer. Troupes travel around like [[minstrels]] performing at various locales. There are many regional styles, depending on the local tone contours and preferred instrumentation and melodies.&lt;ref name="Rachel, Lam 2007"&gt;B., Rachel, Lam, M. B., Cullen, A. et al (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The music that accompanies a lam lao performance may also include various types of [[percussion]], fiddles, lutes, xylophones, or oboes as well as some that are more characteristic of classical ensembles. Lyrics are drawn from old [[poetry]], classical stories, or improvised according to the complicated [[tonality|tonal]] rhyming patterns of the verse and can range from topics as serious as religious sermons and Jataka tales to sometimes bawdy verses about love and sex.&lt;ref name="Rachel, Lam 2007"/&gt;

Although the performances themselves are not necessarily theatrical, the closest being the exchanges of witty repartées in alternating verses or songs between a male and a female morlam who pretend to fall in love before departing or friends who try to outwit each other. The songs are interspersed with dance numbers, comedic routines, ham acting, and teasing between the performers and the audience.&lt;ref name="Brandon, J. R. 1993"&gt;Brandon, J. R. (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk dance===
[[File:Yasothondancers01.JPG|thumb|250px|A folk dance in the [[Rocket Festival]] parade in Yasothorn, Thailand. The Lao of Isan have preserved Lao cultural traditions, including [[morlam]] and folk music.]] 
Lao folk dances (ຟ້ອນລຳພື້ນເມືອງ {{IPA-lo|fɔ̂ːn lám pʰɯ̂ːn mɯ́əŋ|}}) are numerous and varied, much like lam lao. In fact, most ''lam'' also have an associated [[folk dance]]. And Other popular dances include the southern ''lam Tang Vai'' (ລຳຕັງຫວາຽ {{IPA|[lám taŋ wǎːj]}}) and ''Lam Saravane'' (ລຳສາຣະວັນ {{IPA|[lám sǎː lā ván]}}).&lt;ref&gt;Lao cultural profile. (2008, February 26). Retrieved from http://www.culturalprofiles.net/laos/Directories/Laos_Cultural_Profile/-54.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular folk dance, however, is the ''lam vong'' (ລຳວົງ {{IPA|[lám wóŋ]}}). It is the national dance of Laos, and versions of it exist throughout the Lao-speaking region and even Cambodia, where it is known as [[ramvong]]. A slow and graceful couples dance, the men form an inner circle and the women an outer circle, with couples dancing around each other while moving in their respective circles.  It is a common feature of [[weddings]], celebrations, and other social events.&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield, S. and Koh, M. (2008). ''Cultures of the world: laos.'' Tarrytown, NY: Marshall Cavendish Corp.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lam luang (likay lao)===
A truly theatrical derivative of [[morlam]], it is believed to have developed when the morlam began to dress up and act out various characters from the sung repertoire of oral traditions, myths and legends.it is better known as Lam Luang (ລຳເຣື່ອງ {{IPA|[lám lɯ̄əŋ]}}) or ''sung story.'' Stories range from traditional to lewd, serious to bawdy, and are drawn from a diverse range of sources, such as the traditional stories and [[Jataka]] tales to even development projects and community concerns. Music can be classical, morlam, or even modern, and costumes also run the gamut depending on the needs of the story.&lt;ref&gt;Clewley, J. (2001). 'Laos: beyond our khaen.' ''World music: latin and north america, caribbean, india, asia and pacific.'' (II ed.) Broughton, S., Duane, O., McConnachie, J. (ed.) New York, NY: Penguin Putnam.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common to Lam Luang theatre performances are stock characters common to all stories. These include the hero (ພຣະເອກ {{IPA|[pʰāʔ ʔȅːk]}}), the heroine (ນາງເອກ {{IPA|[náːŋ ʔȅːk]}}), king father, queen mother, clown, villain (ຜູ້ຮ້າຽ {{IPA|[pʰȕː hâːj]}}), and supernatural forces such as gods, demons, spirits, or [[ogres]].&lt;ref name="Brandon, J.

Before services, they bathe and don white clothing, turbans,&lt;ref name="Kaufman" /&gt; and a loose striped over-garment called a ''shamma''.  Debteras carry prayer sticks to the service, where they sing, dance, and play drums and [[sistrum|sistra]] outside the church or the [[synagogue]] during religious services.&lt;ref name="Munro-Hay p52-53" /&gt;

=== Among the Beta Israel ===
Among the Beta Israel, the status of debtera is a milestone in the study to become a [[kahen]]. Unlike fully-fledged Kahens (who perform none of the functions of ''debtra''), debteras are closer to the laypeople, often serving as intermediaries between them and the clergy. A Kahen who gives up his position or is deposed may serve as a ''debtera''.&lt;ref name="Greenfield"&gt;Isaac Greenfield, "The Debtera and the education among Ethiopian Jewry until the arrival of Dr. Faitlovitch" in Menachem Waldman (ed.), ''Studies in the History of Ethiopian Jews'', Habermann Institute of Literary Research, 2011, pp. 109-135 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Among Christians ===
''Kahens'' and ''debteras'' are two separate professions,&lt;ref name="Munro-Hay p47"&gt;{{cite book|last=Munro-Hay|first=Stuart|authorlink=Stuart Munro-Hay|title=Ethiopia, the Unknown Land: A Cultural and Historical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NWNTfztz5KoC&amp;pg=PA47|year=2002|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-744-4|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is possible to pursue both roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crummey|first=Donald|title=Land and Society in the Christian Kingdom of Ethiopia: From the Thirteenth to the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Di0w6h0qHGMC&amp;pg=PA174|year=2000|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-02482-5|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orthodox Tewahedo]] churches see the division as following the model used by the ancient Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milkias|first=Paulos|title=Ethiopia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iu9mnXhvSswC&amp;pg=PA175|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-258-6|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Lenten services, ''debteras'' tap prayer sticks to keep the rhythm.  The Ethiopian Church condones the performances of ''debteras'', citing the story in [[2 Kings]] of [[David]] dancing at the temple and {{Bibleverse||Psalm|47:1|KJV}} ("[[Psalm 47|O clap your hands]]") for Biblical examples.  These performances also feature symbols connected to the [[Passion of Jesus]]: the sistrum's swaying and the beating of the drums represent Christ's swaying while enduring beatings, and the tapping of the prayer sticks represent the [[flagellation of Christ]].&lt;ref name="Munro-Hay p47" /&gt;

== Religio-Magical Healing ==
Debteras participate in liturgy as singers and musicians and, outside the Church religio-magical healers by performing as herbalists, astrologers, fortune-tellers etc. Some Ethiopian authors consider these healers as ‘spiritual healers’ whereas, they are purely religio-magical healers.&lt;ref name="Janetius, S.T 2016"&gt;Janetius, S.T. Abyssinia in the New Millennium (Revised Edition), 2016. {{ISBN|9783659710629}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all duties taken on by Debteras are condoned by the Ethiopian Church. Many distribute contraceptive herbs to women and perform magic meant to perform contraceptive functions, in contradiction to the Ethiopian Church's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l4WUdKWGcYsC&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;ots=pammUsXz-J&amp;dq=famous%20dabtaras&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=famous%20dabtaras&amp;f=false "Healer," Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: He-N, by Siegbert Uhlig, publ. by Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2007, p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some are also reputed to study [[black magic]] invoking [[demon]]s alongside their more benevolent official learning.&lt;ref name="Molvaer" /&gt;

Some Debteras manufacture [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] [[amulet]]s meant to protect the wearer from evil spirits.&lt;ref name="Turner" /&gt;  These amulets are often made of silver and are noted for their use against the legendary [[Buda (folk religion)|budas]], [[zār]] spirits, and the [[evil eye]].  They may also study a variety of anti-magic invocations, [[prayer]]s, and exorcisms.  These exorcisms may include prayers, blessing of [[holy water]] (which the possessed person drinks), burning of roots, and incantations from a ''Magic Star Book''.&lt;ref name="Geleta" /&gt;  Some amulets may take the form of small scrolls kept in pouches or similar containers, made from the skin of a sacrificed goat or lamb whose blood is used to ritually purify the intended owner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medievalportland.pdx.edu/?q=ethiopian-magic-scroll Description of Ethiopian Magic Scroll] at [[Portland State University]]'s [http://www.medievalportland.pdx.edu/ Medieval Portland site].&lt;/ref&gt;  Some practice (or rather circumvent) [[astrology]], by giving unlucky people new stars by changing their names.  This may be considered "cheating" by the locals, however.  Some Debteras have also been noted to use [[Datura stramonium]] to cause hallucinations.&lt;ref name="Molvaer" /&gt;

A debtera may charge a fee for his charms, exorcisms, and astrological practices, but not liturgical activities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=J00xEkY-vTEC&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=debtera&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q=debtera&amp;f=false A History of African Higher Education from Antiquity to the Present: A Critical Synthesis By G-m G-m Lulat, ABC-CLIO, 30 Aug 2005, p.56]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of the Debteras duties and cures are [[supernatural]].  Debteras place [[scarecrow]]s in farm fields to protect them and shave heads to prevent [[lice]] outbreaks.&lt;ref name="Finneran" /&gt;  Before the [[Derg|1974 revolution]], nobles would often hire Debteras to educate their children.&lt;ref name="Molvaer" /&gt;

A major theological difference in the healing practices of Priests and Debteras is that for the priests, sin Vs virtue or evil-spirit Vs God is the basis for any sickness and healings. Therefore, they prescribe prayer (degmit) and holy water (tsebel), baptism (washing of sins), fasting, penance together with holy water as a remedy. For the debteras it is evil spirit Vs human beings; almost all the sickness are possession of evil spirits or caused by evil spirits, therefore, prayer (degmit) and holy water (tsebel) become the integral part of any ritualistic religious healing ceremony. Besides these, kitab or amulets are also prepared and give by them to be worn to wade away the evil spirits and evil eye (buda). On the other hand, the priests use the practice of confession, fasting, penance and Church attendance as a means of healing together with some sort of advice and guidance. The soul-father, called yenafs abbat is a kind of family spiritual-doctor, common in many places makes frequent visits to the home and performs services as required.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.in/Abyssinia-New-Millennium-Dr-Janetius/dp/1522757716&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Janetius, S.T 2016"/&gt;

The '''Europa Philharmonie''' is a European [[symphony orchestra]] made up of musicians from European Union countries as well as musicians from all over the world who have made Europe their home. Since 2009, the orchestra has been based in [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]], and is supported by the association Friends of Europa Philharmonie. The founder and principal conductor is [[Reinhard Seehafer]].

== History ==
The idea for a European orchestra came from general director Professor Wolf-Dieter Ludwig and the principal conductor, Reinhard Seehafer, after the borders in Europe had fallen away, and later under the name of Europa Philharmonie, was substantiated through the work with the artistic director Ferry Tomaszyk at worldwide guest performances as ambassadors of the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]. The orchestra's debut took place in 1996 with live television coverage across Europe with [[3sat]], performing [[Gustav Mahler]]'s "[[Symphony No. 2 (Mahler)|Resurrection]]" in St. Peters's Church, [[Görlitz]] under the direction of principal conductor Reinhard Seehafer, with cooperation from the foundation [[Krzyżowa, Świdnica County|Kreisau/Krzyzowa]].

Europa Philharmonie stands for a tolerant and unified Europe, which is a view also reflected in the patronage of the German and Polish state presidents, and the president of the German Federal Parliament, as well as the work of the board of trustees "Indivisible Europe" of which Professor [[Kurt Masur]], the late [[Lea Rabin]], [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]] and Prof.
Dr. Dieter Stolte are members.

From 1998 to 2007, the orchestra was based in Schloss Hundisburg (Hundisburg Castle) in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], which is one of the most important baroque castles in northern Germany.

==Worldwide Concert Activity==
* In honour of the 30th anniversary of the diplomatic relationship between the Federal Republic of Germany and the People's Republic of [[China]] in 2002, Europa Philharmonie gave guest performances in [[Shanghai]], [[Beijing]] and five other cities in China.
* In 2004, the orchestra was the first classical symphony orchestra in the world to perform in [[Sana'a]], the capital city of Yemen, at the opening concert for "Sana'a - Cultural Capital of the Arab World", which was attended by its patron, the former President of the [[Bundestag]], [[Wolfgang Thierse]], and the Yemen Minister for Culture and Tourism, Khalid Al-Rewaishan. In addition to the invited guests, an audience of 5.000 experienced this spectacular concert with the city of Sana'a as a backdrop. The concert was also televised across the entire Arabian world. This tour also took the orchestra to [[Abu-Dhabi]], [[Ajman]] and [[Oman]], where the orchestra performed traditional New Year's concerts.
* Gala Concert "Welcome to Europe" in 2004, televised live, in the capital city of [[Cyprus]], [[Nicosia]], in honour of [[2004_enlargement_of_the_European_Union#Cyprus|Cyprus' upcoming entry into the EU]].
* In 2005, the orchestra undertook a concert tour as ambassadors for the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in honour of the 60th anniversary of the end of the 2nd world war from [[Kefalonia]] to Athens and [[Crete]], all places where massacres took place.
* "Christmas Gala" 2005 in [[Antalya]], [[Turkey]], where the orchestra was awarded a prize for their work in intercultural understanding.

==Current projects==
* ''Education and Music'' for apprentice under the patronage of Prof. Dr. Claus Hipp
* ''Europe needs young people'' for school students in Germany, Switzerland and France
* ''Cultural Sustainability for Future Generations'' with projects to do with climate change and the protection of the environment

==Background==
[[File:I.am.a.curator.13.11.03.jpg|thumb|right|''Installation view from I am a Curator''&lt;br&gt;Chisenhale Gallery, 13 November 2003, Muller Kneer Associates]]

Hüttner carried out a series of exhibitions that democratized or investigated the curatorial process in the late 1990s and in the early years of the new millennium.&lt;ref&gt;A Tasty Treat, James Westcott, [[Zingmagazine]] 18; p.270-272; 2003; New York, United States&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these were collaborative and took place at the Gallery [[Konstakuten]] in Stockholm, [[The Hood Gallery]] in Los Angeles but also in galleries and public spaces in London, New York City and [[Vancouver]] and involved artists from different generations and included [[Geoffrey Farmer]], [[Brian Jungen]], [[Lenke Rothman]], [[Neil Goldstein]] and curators like [[Reid Shier]] and [[Tone O Nielsen]].&lt;ref&gt;Amelie Nordenfelt, ''Introduction", ''Curatorial Mutiny'', p. 9, edited by Per Hüttner, 2003, 120 pages, texts by: Per Hüttner, Amelie Nordenfelt, Gavin wade, Tone O. Nielsen, Drabble+Sachs, Claire Canning and Tone Hansen. Design by Voodoo Graphics and Jonas Lindén. Published by Föreningen Curatorial MutinyStockholm, 2003. {{ISBN|91-631-3247-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 he created the curatorial framework for an exhibition at [[Nylon (gallery)|Nylon]] in collaboration with [[Goshka Macuga]] and [[Gavin Wade]].&lt;ref&gt;Neal Brown, [http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/3_in_1_curatorial_mutiny_part_4/ ''3 in 1 Curatorial Mutiny, Part 4'', ''Frieze'', Issue 60, June – August 2001.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203192526/http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/3_in_1_curatorial_mutiny_part_4/ |date=3 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2002 at Curatorial Market at [[Cuchifritos]] and various public venues including [[Essex Street Market]] in New York. In these projects he developed ideas and practices that pointed towards a new way of relating to the art object and exhibition making that eventually became manifest in I am a Curator.:&lt;ref&gt;A Tasty Treat, James Westcott, Zingmagazine 18; p.270-272; 2003; New York City&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Despite its populist ideals, the Curatorial Market raises complex, insider issues about the relationship between artist and curator. ‘These two disciplines are beginning to mix and merge in ways that some people find appalling and others see as a powerful new development in the history of art making,’ [[Paul Clay]] explains. However, abandoning the idea of the autonomous piece of art can be problematic. ‘Having art that relates very strongly to the market context can fuck up the commodification process in an interesting way. It both points it up as an object to consume, and at the same time makes it harder to effectively remove from its context in order to be sold.’ Furthermore, ‘There is a danger that when curators have too strong an {{sic|?|hide=y|over-|arching}} vision, the artists' works can end up simply as building blocks used to construct the curator's point. On the other hand if the curator's point is weak then the works can get stranded totally out of context’."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hüttner has since developed these strategies both in projects like Repetitive Time,&lt;ref&gt;Per Hüttner: Repetitive Time, 2006, 116 pages including 30 colour plates, texts by Lena Boëthius, Laurent Devèze, Per Hüttner, Claire Canning and Stéphanie Nava, language: English, design by Henrik Gistvall.

==Basic structure==

During six weeks people or groups of people with no prior experience in exhibition making undertook 36 investigative exercises into the process of putting together an exhibition. From the outset, the idea was to create an exhibition each day, but quickly the focus moved to investigate the 57 artworks as a resource. In order to realize this strategy the artist developed some basic concepts:

'''Curator of the Day''': The daily slots were administered through an application process through which we tried to give as many different people as possible, in relation to occupation, age, sex, social and ethnic background. More often than not, the Curator of Day was a small group. Meaning that in the end roughly 70 people were curators.&lt;ref name="Introdictionary" /&gt;

'''The Gallery Crew''': The Gallery Crew was the Curators of the Day’s aid in developing their ideas and the project that they wanted to realize during the day. The Curator of the Day was not allowed to touch the artwork, except in those cases when this was an integral part of the piece. All the handling and mounting of the work was carried out by the Gallery Crew. The crew was also responsible for informing the visitors to the gallery about the project and answering questions.&lt;ref name="Introdictionary" /&gt;

'''Support Structure''': Support Structure hosted all the artwork. It was mobile and it was also used to display work, as well as change the size and appearance of the space. It incorporated two tables and half a dozen chairs that could also be used as plinths to present work on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.supportstructure.org&lt;/ref&gt; But [[Celine Condorelli]] and [[Gavin Wade]] took their brief further and allowed Support Structure be a questioning and critical tool and an important aspect of the process of the project. The structure took the centre stage, but in an unexpected way the Curators of the Day remained strangely blind to the eleven meter long monster object on wheels and few, if any, references were made to it in their reports.&lt;ref&gt;Support Structures, Celine Condorelli, p. 115-128, Sternberg Press (2009), {{ISBN|978-1-933128-45-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two also offered objects and lists of what to do if the Curator of the Day gets stuck and included phone numbers to well-known contemporary curators.&lt;ref&gt;Paul O'Neill, p.168, Metropolis Rise: New Art from London, edited by Anthony Gross and Jen Wu, {{Proper name|temporarycontemporary}}, London 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Selectors''': To provide a dynamic collection for the Curator of the Day to choose from, six people were asked to select artwork for I Am a Curator. Each devised a different approach for his or her selection. They were [[Patrick Bernier]], [[Melanie Keen]], [[Lisa Le Feuvre]], Tone O. Nielsen, Reid Shier and Per Hüttner.&lt;ref name="Introdictionary" /&gt;

'''The Interface Cards''': A5-sized plastic cards were designed and realized by American artist [[Scott Rigby]]. For each artwork available for selection there was one corresponding Interface Card. The Interface Cards along with the website (which used the same design) were the main tools for the Curator of the Day to select artwork and devise their exhibition.&lt;ref name="Introdictionary" /&gt;

The Website: All the artwork available for selection could be browsed on Chisenhale Gallery’s website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chisenhale.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; There was also continually updated photographic documentation of the exhibitions created by the Curators of the Day.

==The exhibitions and the audience==

[[File:I.am.a.curator.11.12.03.jpg|thumb|''Installation view from I am a Curator''&lt;br&gt;Chisenhale Gallery, 11 December 2003, Anton Nikolotov]]

Each of the 36 exhibitions realized within the framework of I am a Curator took on very different forms and used the artwork and the space in very different ways. Artist [[Hannah Rickards]] who was leading the gallery crew describes an exhibition that had great impact on the development of the project:&lt;ref name="dialogue"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Embassy of Work With Me ([[å.b.ä.k.e]] /[[Royal College of Art|RCA]]), emptied Support Structure of all its contents, Jokers and artworks, and developed a chromatic scale around the walls of the gallery (the structure having been pushed to the corner). The colour of the individual group members’ clothes determined which works they had responsibility for placing. The process had a very easily achieved self-perpetuating logic that extended to colour-coding drill batteries, [[masking tape]], [[spirit level]]s, any tools that we may have set down for a moment. The colour-coding also included the covers of the CDs bought from the local junk shop in order to complete [[Sam Ely and Lynn Harris]]’ Playlist, along with all the book covers from [[Céline Condorelli]]’s and Gavin Wade's Joker selection of books. This seemed the most natural and successful exercise in [[devolution]] and levelling democratization that occurred during the run of the show. The ‘artworks’ suffered less in this [[melee]] than they often did when not surrounded by a [[chromatic]] sea of things; they were scrutinized and investigated by the curating group."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hüttner talks about a few of the key experiences among the 36 exhibitions:&lt;ref name="dialogue" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;”I have to mention Anton Nikolotov’s project (11/12/03). He wanted the work to be selected democratically. He thus devoted the whole day [[discussion|discussing]] with the visitors which works should be displayed. Each visitor who was present at a given moment was given some time to voice why a certain piece should or shouldn't be shown. When everyone had presented their case, the group [[election|voted]] and notes were taken on the different ideas and how many votes the different pieces got. In the end the only show that was presented was one made up of these notes shown in the massive empty space. This approach allowed I Am a Curator to be taken to another level. The boundaries between Curator of the Day and audience vanished entirely. It was wonderful to see how the process of democratization could be taken one step further than had originally been foreseen. This [[democratic process]] was at once extremely rewarding, but also hugely tiring. Rarely have I seen the members of the Gallery Crew leave so happy and tired. It was also great to see how visitors tended to stay for hours to join the discussion. At one point 15 people were present for the vote."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other shows included Sebastian Roach's Art for Wine Day 13/12/03 which took quite a [[nihilism|nihilist]] approach to the task of selecting work:&lt;ref&gt;”Sebastian Roach is a Curator”, e-mail sent out to Chisenhale mailing list, December 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;”In exchange for the donation of a bottle of wine (or beer, or spirits  – even a miniature, the important thing is the token) a visitor can select and display any piece of work in the show. Alternatively they can donate a new piece of work and I will give them a bottle of wine in exchange for it. In addition, through the course of the day I will install myself in an ‘office’ created by using the versatile structure as walls drinking wine, smoking cigarettes and writing.  What I write will be spontaneous and in response – directly, indirectly, or entirely [[tenuous]]ly – to the work, the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] and the situation, and will obviously also be tempered by the increasing consumption of alcohol. Whatever writing I do produce at the end of the day will also be available in [[Trade|exchange]] for wine."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The diversity of the Curator of the Day and how they interacted with the work can be exemplified by Hüttner's [[endnote]] in the catalogue:&lt;ref name="dialogue" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;” The data that I Am a Curator generated is in itself something that would suffice for a research  project. I was pleased on the last day of the exhibition that the two [[anthropologist]]s Lisa Maddigan and Fuyubi Nakamura did a project that looked at the accumulated information. I think that they were slightly awestruck by the sheer bulk of information and work that could be hosted within the project. It is like the number of possibilities of arranging 57 artworks that Maki from å.b.ä.k.e. had calculated – 144,115,188,075,856,000. Considering that our [[solar system]] is roughly 2,400,000,000,000,000 minutes old [[probability|the number of possibilities]] is quite mind-boggling.
”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Critique==

At the time of the realization of the project there was some rather loud critique towards the project.&lt;ref&gt;p. 157, Barnaby Drabble, Stop making Sense: The Ends of Curating and the Beginnings of the Exhibition, Thesis submitted to the Edinburgh College of Art in fulfilment Of the requirements of the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested&lt;ref&gt;Paul O'Neill, The Culture of Curating and the Curating of Culture(s), 2012, p. 112-14, The MIT Press, Cambridge Massachusetts 02142, {{ISBN|9780262017725}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it offered a very traditional approach to the idea of how an exhibition might be made. In an interview with Barnaby Drabble the artist says.&lt;ref&gt;Per Hüttner, '' Per Hüttner and Gavin Wade interviewed by Barnaby Drabble '', '' Marianne Eigenheer (Hg.) Curating Critique'', '' ICE Reader 1'', 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-86588-451-0}}]&lt;/ref&gt;":

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I do agree, when you are faced with the possibility of just selecting existing art work that is a very traditional take on what a curator is. But then again, I think that I Am A Curator tried to do something that goes beyond that. By using a very traditional approach it enabled us to do something that was extremely creative and which opened new ideas about how to put together exhibitions. In terms of selecting the works, It wasn't as if they had only five pieces to choose from. To consider the work of fifty-seven artists in one afternoon is a major task. Also, a lot of the work was not finished, it was up to the curator of the day to complete it, a lot was interactive, and a lot had different elements that needed to be put together. So there were many different approaches on offer, reflecting the working methods of the original selectors."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another criticism of the project was that the individual artwork never got the attention it deserved.&lt;ref&gt;"Le curating est le reponse...", Paul O'Neill, 02#35, p.14-16, 2005, Nantes, France&lt;/ref&gt; Hannah Rickards who was leading the gallery crew writes:&lt;ref name="dialogue" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Even the 57 official ‘artworks,’ depending on their treatment by the Curator of the Day, sometimes barely managed to retain their “artwork” status. There were times when they did slip into being things in cupboards or things on the wall. That slippage between artworks and objects, or between people’s roles in the process, is something I see as having been central to the project, so I don’t know if I necessarily see the need for a posthumous proliferation of the term “artwork.” It feels like [[lamination|laminating]] a piece of paper you are still making notes on. In the context of this project a wipe-clean definition seems to jar."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a review for ''C: International Contemporary Art Magazine'', [[Fergal Stapleton]] described the exhibition as "a game, mutative and feudal, with several tiers of collusion" and "a bid for curatorial practice as art, and for curatorial supremacy over its subject arts disciplines."&lt;ref name="Stapleton"&gt;{{cite journal|title='I am a curator'.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his PhD thesis Barnaby Drabble uses I am a Curator as one of three case studies. He quotes Stapleton and builds a severe critique to the project which he perceives as being elitist and self-promotional under the guise of being democratic.&lt;ref&gt;p. 155-157, Barnaby Drabble, Stop making Sense: The Ends of Curating and the Beginnings of the Exhibition, Thesis submitted to the Edinburgh College of Art in fulfillment Of the requirements of the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On a more positive note British sociologist and media theorist, [[David Gauntlett]] suggests that projects like I am a Curator expands art into being a visual sociology;&lt;ref&gt;David Gauntlett, "Creative Explorations New Approaches to Identities and Audiences", p. 119-20. Routledge, London, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We should note that, in some cases, the work of socially engaged visual artists and the work of visual sociologists can look very similar. Many artists have used art to explore identity, memory and the construction of selfhood [...]. Other contemporary artists have engaged in a more externally oriented art practice which involves ‘ordinary’ people in the making of work. Just as visual sociology sometimes blurs into something like art, in these projects, art expands into being a kind of visual sociology. There are many instances of such projects; here I will give just a few examples. A project by the artist Per Hüttner, at Chisenhale Gallery, London, entitled I Am a Curator, gave 30 individuals or groups the opportunity to be ‘Curator of the Day’, over a period of six weeks (5 November–14 December 2003). Each day a new exhibition was assembled, using work by 57 artists that was made available in the gallery."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is clear that, I am a Curator offered novel ways for the audience to interact with artwork and the idea of an exhibition. They were forced to deal with art in a more intimate way than in a traditional exhibition. This means that the art on display might have been visible to a smaller audience than in a normal situation and yet at the same time the [[intimacy]], reflection and constant change of context that the work was perceived in, meant that the audience was offered the possibility to understand the complexities and contradictions of artwork on a more profound level.&lt;ref name="dialogue" /&gt; This experimental approach to authorship and authenticity offers opportunity for creative interpretations.&lt;ref name="Form p.134-35"/&gt; This openness in its turn has led to that I am a Curator has been appropriated by various participants of the project as being 'their own' in publications and academic texts.&lt;ref name="Form p.134-35"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jes Fernie, Two Minds: Artists And Architects in Collaboration, p. 136-142, Black Dog Publishing, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ten Year Anniversary==

For the 10 year anniversary of I am a Curator [[David Roberts Art Foundation]] in London invited Per Huttner to reflect on the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vision-forum.blogspot.nl/2013/09/i-am-curator-after-10-years-what.html Vision Forum website]&lt;/ref&gt; In the press release it is stated that "The project also provoked profound questions about artistic identity and its relationship to collectivity. Both shifts, in turn, lead to changed perspectives on the relationship between artworks, exhibitions, curators and artists. In short, IAAC opened a floodgate of problematics that overwhelmed the team working with the project. It is therefore important to revisit these questions after 10 years have passed, and to see how they have influenced individual artistic processes and how they can guide us into meaningful future reflections on related issues."&lt;ref&gt;Press release on The David Roberts Art Foundation website [http://davidrobertsartfoundation.com/projects/i-am-a-curator-after-10-years-what-defines-an-artistic-practice-tuesday-29-october-2013-6-30-to-8-30pm]/&lt;/ref&gt; Per Hüttner was joined by artist/architect [[Céline Condorelli]], [[neuroscientist]] [[Stephen Whitmarsh]] and Anette and [[Alberto Giacometti Foundation]] Director [[Véronique Wiesinger]].

The '''Image Universe''' is a [[fictional universe|fictional]] [[shared universe]] wherein many of the [[comic book]]s published by [[Image Comics]] take place.

== Publication history ==
The Image Universe began with the founding of Image Comics in 1992, launching with series such as ''[[The Savage Dragon]]'', ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'', ''[[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]]'' and ''[[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.T.s]]''.

Image Comics' nature of allowing comic creators to retain the rights to the characters they publish with Image had led to many characters entering or exiting the Image Universe as the creators move from or to other publishers. Image co-founder and ''Savage Dragon'' creator Erik Larsen generally treats the Image Universe continuity as though each title exists in its own universe, and any crossovers between different creators' characters are events that occur simultaneously in each respective characters' universes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=15081 |title=One Fan's Opinion: Issue #14 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=2005-11-10 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Jim Lee was an Image partner, his [[WildStorm]] properties such as ''[[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.T.s]]'', ''[[Stormwatch (comics)|Stormwatch]]'', ''[[Gen¹³]]'', ''[[Union (comics)|Union]]'', ''[[Deathblow (comics)|Deathblow]]'', ''[[Wetworks]]'', and ''[[Backlash (comics)|Backlash]]'' regularly crossed over with other Image characters, but when he sold his studio to [[DC Comics]], this ceased, and the WildStorm characters have since been incorporated into the post-"[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" [[DC Universe]]. Most of the comic characters in the Image Universe however are originally individually creator-owned from when the company was established.

There were several Image crossover mini-series in the 1990s, such as ''Shattered Image'', ''Altered Image'' and ''Splitting Image'', along with the Eclipse Comics satire ''Spittin' Image'', but only ''[[Mars Attacks]] Image'' had any direct impact on the titles represented, as the Martians' attack was also shown and referenced many times in the ''Savage Dragon'' series.

In 2009, the Image Universe had its first major crossover in several years with ''[[Image United]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2925">British prime minister [[Harold Wilson]] set up a working party in August 1975 to report on 'the requirements of a viable and prosperous British film industry over the next decade'. Chaired by John Terry, the managing director of the [[National Film Finance Corporation]] (NFFC), it reported in January 1976,&lt;ref&gt;The Future of the British Film Industry (Cmnd 6372), Report of the Prime Minister's Working Party&lt;/ref&gt; principally recommending the establishment of a British Film Authority to bring together the NFFC, [[British Film Fund Agency]] and the film activities of the [[Department of Education and Science (United Kingdom)|Department of Education and Science]] and the [[Department of Trade]]. However, before action could be taken, Wilson resigned as prime minister. His successor, [[James Callaghan]] appointed an '''Interim Action Committee on the Film Industry''' (IAC), with Wilson as chairman, with a view to paving the way for a British Film Authority.

The committee met under the auspices of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]], which provided the secretariat and facilities. Following the election of the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] government in 1979 it became evident that the idea of a British Film Authority was being dropped, although the IAC was retained as a forum for advice about film-related matters. In the 1984 White Paper on Film Policy,&lt;ref&gt;Film Policy (Cmnd 9319), presented to Parliament 19 July 1984&lt;/ref&gt; which set about removing the mechanisms of state support for the film industry, it was proposed that the IAC should subsume the role of the [[Cinematograph Films Council]]. In 1985 the Interim Action Committee was replaced by [[The British Screen Advisory Council]].

==Reports==
The IAC produced five reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.terramedia.co.uk/reference/law/official_british_media_reports_film.htm| title= Official British Media Reports| accessdate= 2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jinshan and the West Lake''''' ({{nihongo|金山西湖図屏風}}) is a painting on [[Byōbu|six Byobu folding screens]] by Japanese artist [[Kano Sanraku]], the master of the [[Kanō school|Kano painting school]]. The artwork is done with the employment of ink, paint, gold and paper. Currently, it is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/671028|title=Jinshan Island and West Lake|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that both parts of the screen are visually combined with the image of mountains and islands among the water and fog created with the help of golden powder, they depict two separate, geographically separated locations of eastern China. On the right side of the screen is Mount Jinshan located on the [[Yangtze River]], near the city of [[Zhenjiang]] in southern [[Jiangsu]] Province. The artist tried to add to the painting many bridges, roads and paths where people from all walks of life intersect.

On the left side of the first screen is the [[West Lake]], outside the city of [[Hangzhou]]. The artist depicted the walls and gates of this city in the foreground in the left corner. A lot of Buddhist monasteries and places of worship were built in the area of the West Lake (some of them can be found on the mural of the screen), so it attracted many pilgrims.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ZQ8NAl2Bj-4C|title=Japanese Art: Selections from the Mary and Jackson Burke Collection : [exhibition]|last=Murase|first=Miyeko|last2=N.Y.)|first2=Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York|date=1975|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=9780870991363|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many poets, scholars, and artists also lived there&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The West Lake often appeared on the works of artists from the [[Southern Song]]. Kano Sanraku added for painting an iconographic ten species of the West Lake, which became the motive of Chinese poetry and painting of the XII-XIII centuries. Among Japanese works of art before Kano Sanraku, the most famous was a vertical scroll attributed to Sassu, it later became clear that the author was his student Suugetsu [2]. It is known that Sessu made a trip to the West Lake, while Japanese artists of the Muromachi and Edo periods could create their works based solely on the works of their predecessors or on illustrations from books.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Only a few images of the West Lake by Japanese artists contain ten species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On both parts of the painting - from the right side to the left side -seasons from spring to winter. Both parts of the screen are combined using gold to create mist, water, and parts in the background. Gold is worked to soften the composition ofo the transition from one type to another.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The seals of the artist, standing on the screen, indicates the artwork was created around 1630. At that time, Kano Sanraku worked on murals at the Myoshinji Monastery in Kyoto, along with his adopted son, [[Kanō Sansetsu]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Joseph Zalman Margolis''' (born May 16, 1924) is an American [[Philosophy|philosopher]]. A radical [[Historicism|historicist]], he has published many books critical of the central assumptions of [[Western philosophy]], and has elaborated a robust form of [[relativism]].

His philosophical affinities include [[Protagoras]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S. Peirce]], [[John Dewey]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V. Quine]].

== Biography ==
Joseph Margolis was the son of [[American Jews|Jewish immigrants]] from central [[Europe]]. His father, a dentist, read widely in [[literature]] and was proficient in four languages.

Margolis served in [[World War II]] as a [[paratrooper]] and was wounded during the [[Battle of the Bulge]], where he lost his only brother, a twin. He studied at [[Columbia University]], earning the [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] (1950) and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] (1953) in philosophy. His contemporaries at Columbia have included the art theorist [[Arthur C. Danto]] and the philosopher Marx Wartofsky.

Margolis has taught at numerous universities in the [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Canada]] and has lectured throughout [[Europe]], in [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]]. Since 1991, he has held the [[Laura H. Carnell]] Chair of Philosophy at [[Temple University]].&lt;ref&gt;For a list of the many associations of which Margolis is a member, see [http://www.pragmatism.org/library/margolis/margolis.htm pragmatism.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205092933/http://www.pragmatism.org/library/margolis/margolis.htm |date=2007-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 Margolis was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |title=Humanist Manifesto II |publisher=American Humanist Association |accessdate=October 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020110719/http://www.americanhumanist.org/humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |archivedate=October 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

===Introduction===
As set out in ''Historied Thought, Constructed World'' (California, 1995), Margolis holds that philosophy is concerned principally with three things:

# what we assume to be the nature of the real world, and why;
# what we assume to be how much we might know about the real world, and why;
# and after having answered those questions as best we can, how we should live out our lives, and why.

He sees the [[history of philosophy]] concerning these three questions of [[reality]], [[knowledge]] and [[ethics]] as a gradual movement away from the idea that any of these three realms is changeless and towards an increasing acceptance of real change infecting all three spheres.  Margolis emphasizes that [[legitimation]] is philosophy's principal task.

Margolis defends the Protagorean dictum that "man is the measure of all things", arguing that all changeless first principles must give way to consensual, though not criterial, truth claims. Since "man", the measure, is himself a creature of [[history]], no modal claims of invariance can possibly be sustained. Margolis further avers that there need be no fixities either ''de re'' or ''de dicto'' or ''de cogitatione''. The world is a flux and our thought about it is also in flux. Margolis sees the whole history of [[Western philosophy]] as a struggle between the advocates of change and those who either, like [[Parmenides]], deny that change is intelligible, or those, like [[Heraclitus]], who find some ''[[logos]]'' or [[law]] which allegedly governs whatever changes are admitted. He has argued that cognitive privilege of the changeless lingers even in relatively pragmatic philosophy such as the work of W.V. Quine. Nonetheless, Margolis proposes possible modes of legitimation even under the ubiquity of flux. Contrary to [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] philosophers like [[Richard Rorty]] or [[Jean-François Lyotard]], he argues that our lack of cognitive privilege means that the need for philosophical justification becomes more, not less, pressing.

Margolis began close to the so-called [[Analytic philosophy|analytical school]] of English-speaking philosophy but his mature work draws freely on both analytic and [[Continental philosophy]].  In large part this disciplinary eclecticism reflects his ambition to overcome the apparent opposition between the [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] tradition of analytic philosophy and the [[Humanism|humanistic]] tradition of Continental philosophy.

To achieve this, Margolis treats the "natural" as [[Ontology|ontologically]] prior to the [[Culture|cultural]], while emphasizing that we only know [[nature]] via cultural means, hence, that the cultural is [[Epistemology|epistemologically]] prior to the natural.  This position is developed at length in his ''Selves and Other Texts'' (Penn State, 2001).

His philosophical pursuits, expressed programmatically, are:

# a critique of most mainstream Western philosophers, classical and modern;
# the advocacy of a consistent form of relativism;
# the defence of a radical historicism, which avoids the pitfalls of past historicisms, such as those of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], or [[Michel Foucault]];
# and an account of how legitimation functions under his historicist conditions.

===Themes===
Margolis has published more than thirty books, on a variety of topics in philosophy.  In ''Historied Thought, Constructed World'' (California, 1995), he argues that philosophy uncritically adopts the Platonic-Aristotelian view that "necessarily, reality is invariantly structured and, when known, discernibly known to be such".  Beginning with his counterproposal - "(2.1) It is not in any way conceptually necessary that reality possess invariant structures or an invariant nature" - Margolis gradually traces out an alternative view.  For instance, Margolis argues that [[Aristotle]]'s discussion of the [[Law of noncontradiction|principle of non-contradiction]] presupposes the changelessness of individual things rather than providing any proof of the alleged law. In Margolis's view non-contradiction applies to "sentential formulas" and not to "meaningful sentences", since discourse in use may always offset any seeming contradiction via re-interpretation, as is routinely done in science (for instance, in the case of the wave theory versus the corpuscular theory of light). In other words, there is no conceptual necessity to accept a strictly bivalent logic; our logics depend, in a deep sense, on what we pre-thinkingly take the real world to be like. Hence, there is no reason to disallow relativism at all, for the world may well be the kind of place where incongruent judgments - judgments which on a bivalent reading would be "true" or "false", but are now no longer so, adhering to a many valued logic, one consisting of more than two exclusive [[truth-value]]s - are all that creatures such as ourselves may ever hope to legitimate.

Margolis goes on to examine reference and predication as our ability to probe and communicate the results of our probings. Constative discourse – the making of statements of fact — for instance need only rely on identification, and reidentification, of items for it to prove effective in use. Therefore, historical memory and consensus, together with a narratizing ability, are all that are necessary to ensure the stability of what we make reference to, there need be nothing essential at all in things themselves, for our constative discourse to be able to flourish and even thrive. Margolis inveighs against postmodernists of Rorty’s stamp, claiming that they risk disabling constative discourse in their objectivist fears of privilege. There need be, according to Margolis, no conceptual privilege involved in making statements, nor in the justifications proferred for the statements made.

Still, Margolis emphasizes that justifications cannot be dispensed with, as any statement implies a whole set of beliefs about the way the world is and about how we know that. We must legitimize our statements as best we can, else we should never know why we should choose some over others, nor should we know how to proceed to make other statements building upon, but going beyond, our original exemplars.

The key to how we in fact "go on" is to be found in Margolis's major postulate of ''Historied Thought, Constructed World'': "Thinking is a History".   Making meaningful reference within constative discourse is a thoroughly historical skill. What we predicate - about what is thus referred to - is likewise historical.  Margolis argues that the struggle to entrench changelessness either in human thought or human nature or physical nature has, in large part, been a futile struggle against acknowledging the lack of any fixed-kind nature of the human being.  It is futile, Margolis claims, in that we have no natures but are histories.  Nevertheless, Margolis admits that there are enough man-made would-be stabilities and fixities to go round. There is the habituating weight of the customary, the slow change in human languages, the inertia of institutions.

Margolis acknowledges that the historized "nature" of the human—and therefore of truth, of judgment, of reality, and the rest - is not his own discovery, but criticizes most previous versions of historicism as falling victim to some theological or teleological yearning, as in Hegel's ''Geist'', Marx's utopianism, or Heidegger's history of being.  In Margolis's view, the truth claims of earlier historical epochs are given their historical weight, from our own historical present, our own truth claims regarding theirs are subject to our own bias and blindness, but ours must still be legitimated as best we can legitimate them, taking into account as far as humanly possible – though never overcoming - our limited horizon via self-critique.

Margolis claims that five philosophical themes have gathered momentum from the time of Kant on. They are:

# Reality is cognitively intransparent. That is, everything we say about the world must pass through our conceptual schemes and the limits of our language, hence there is no way of knowing whether what we say "corresponds" to what there is; what the world is like independent of our investigating it;
# The structure of reality and the structure of thought are symbiotized. That is, there is no way of knowing how much of the apparent intelligibility of the world is a contribution of the mind and how much the world itself contributes to that seeming intelligibility;
# Thinking has a history. That is, all we take to be universal, rational, logical, necessary, right behaviour, laws of nature, and so on, are changing artifacts of the historical existence of different societies and societal groups. All are open to change and all are the sites of hegemonic struggle;
# The structure of thinking is preformed. That is, our thinking is formed by the enculturing process by which human babies become adults. The infant begins in a holistic space which is immediately parsed according to the norms and conduct and language she is brought up in. By taking part in the process, we alter it, alter ourselves, and alter the conditions for the next generation;
# Human culture, including human beings, are socially constructed or socially constituted. That is, they have no natures, but are (referentially) or have (predicatively) histories, narratized careers.

He embraces all five themes separately and conjointly, defends them all, and concludes that our future investigations of ourselves and of our world risk ignoring them at our own peril.  His own investigations into "ourselves" have proceeded with a focus on a consideration of the arts as an expression of human being. In ''What, After All, Is a Work of Art'' (1999) and ''Selves and Other Texts'' (2001), he elaborated upon his earlier work on the ontological similarity between human persons and artworks. The latter
– defined as "physically embodied, culturally emergent entities" – he treats as examples of "human utterance". Margolis argues that the cultural world is a semantically and semiotically dense domain, filled with self-interpreting texts, acts and artifacts.

===Affinities and critique===

Margolis has philosophical affinities with Hegel, Marx, Peirce, John Dewey, the later Wittgenstein, and Michel Foucault. From Hegel and Marx, he takes on their historicism without their teleologisms, or theories of some historical goal. From Peirce, he takes the idea of Secondness, the brute thingness of things which guides our sense of reality. With Dewey, he shares the conviction that philosophy should never exceed "natural" bounds. With Wittgenstein, he holds that "what has to be accepted, the given, is – so one could say - forms of life" (PI; 226).  Finally, Margolis sees Foucault's "historical a-priori" as a fair replacement for Kant's transcendental a-priori.

Margolis has extensively criticized what he sees as [[scientism]] in philosophy, singling out thinkers such as [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Paul Churchland]], [[Jerry Fodor]], and [[Daniel Dennett]] as modern-day defenders of invariance.

[[File:G(012).JPG|thumb|First page of the [[Codex Boernerianus]] with lacuna in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 1:1-4]]
A '''lacuna'''{{refn|group=Note|From [[Latin]] ''lacūna'' ("ditch, gap"), literally "little ''lacus''" ("lake, basin").&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|lacuna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|lacuna}}, {{L&amp;S|lacus|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} ({{abbr|pl.|plural}}&amp;nbsp;'''lacunae''' or '''lacunas''') is a gap in a [[manuscript]], [[inscription]], text, painting, or a musical work. A manuscript, text, or section suffering from gaps is said to be "lacunose" or "lacunulose". Some books intentionally add lacunas to be filled in by the owner (e.g., "The _____ played with the _____ in the _____."), often as a game or to encourage children to create their own stories.

Weathering, decay, and other damage to old manuscripts or inscriptions are often responsible for lacunae&amp;mdash;words, sentences, or whole passages that are missing or illegible. [[Palimpsests]] are particularly vulnerable. To reconstruct the original text, the context must be considered. In [[papyrology]] and [[textual criticism]] this may lead to competing reconstructions and interpretations. Published texts that contain lacunae often mark the section where text is missing with a bracketed ellipsis. For example, "This sentence contains 20 words, and [...] nouns," or, "Finally, the army arrived at [...] and made camp."

==Famous examples==
* A famous [[Old English]] example of a lacuna is in the manuscript [[British Library MS Cotton Vitellius A. xv]], the poem [[Beowulf]]:
::hyrde ich thæt [... ...On]elan cwen. '''(Fitt 1, line 62)'''
:This particular lacuna is always reproduced in editions of the text, but many people have attempted to fill it, notably editors Wyatt-Chambers and Dobbie, among others, who accept the verb "waes" (''was''). Malone (1929) proposed the name [[Yrse]] for the unnamed queen, as that would alliterate with [[Onela]]. This is still hotly debated amongst editors, however.&lt;ref&gt;G. Jack, "Beowulf: A Student Edition", [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford: 1994. Pp.31-32, footnote 62.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another notable lacuna is the eight-leaves-long [[Great Lacuna]] in the ''[[Codex Regius]]'', the most prominent source for [[Norse mythology]] and early Germanic heroic legends. Parts of it survived in independent manuscripts and in prose form in the ''[[Völsunga saga]]''.
* In [[Minuscule 69|Codex Leicester]] the text skips from [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 10:45 to 14:17 without a break; possibly a scribe rewrote it from a defective manuscript.

[[File:Xilitla Las Pozas 0407 036.jpg|thumb|The surrealist sculpture park ''Las Pozas'', Xilitla]]

'''Las Pozas''' ("the Pools") is a surrealistic group of structures created by [[Edward James]], more than {{convert|2000|ft|m}} above sea level, in a subtropical rainforest in the mountains of [[Mexico]]. It includes more than {{convert|80|acre|ha}} of natural waterfalls and pools interlaced with towering surrealist sculptures in concrete.&lt;ref name="NYT-30Mar08"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2008/03/30/style/t/index.html#pageName=30laspozas "Dream Works: Can a Legendary Surrealist Garden in Mexico Bloom Again?"], ''New York Times Style Magazine'', 30 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Las Pozas is near the village of [[Xilitla, San Luis Potosí]], a seven-hour drive north of Mexico City. In the early 1940s, James went to [[Los Angeles, California]], and then decided that he "wanted a Garden of Eden set up . . . and I saw that Mexico was far more romantic" and had "far more room than there is in crowded Southern California".&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Hooks, [http://www.edwardjameslaspozas.com "Surreal Eden: Edward James &amp; Las Pozas"], Princeton Architectural Press, New York, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-56898-612-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hollywood in 1941, his lifetime friend and cousin, [[Magic Realism|Magic Realist]] painter [[Bridget Bate Tichenor]], encouraged him to search for a surreal location in Mexico to express his diverse esoteric interests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://BridgetBateTichenor.com/ Bridget Bate Tichenor Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Cuernavaca, Mexico|Cuernavaca]], he hired Plutarco Gastelum as a guide. They came to know Xilitla in November 1945.&lt;ref name="NYT-30Mar08"/&gt; Eventually, Plutarco got married and had four children. James was "Uncle Edward" to the children and frequently stayed with them in a house Plutarco had built, a mock-Gothic cement castle, now a hotel – La Posada El Castillo.&lt;ref name="L&amp;T"/&gt;

Between 1949 and 1984, James built scores of surreal concrete structures which carry the names ''The House on Three Floors Which Will in Fact Have Five or Four or Six'', ''The House with a Roof like a Whale'', and ''The Staircase to Heaven''.&lt;ref name="L&amp;T"&gt;Gini Alhadeff, [http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/concrete-jungle "Concrete Jungle"], ''Travel + Leisure", September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; There were also plantings and beds full of tropical plants, including orchids — there were, apparently, 29,000 at Las Pozas at one time&lt;ref name="TG-6Nov07"&gt;Joanna Moorhead, [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/art/architecture/story/0,,2206530,00.html "The Magic Kingdom (James' Las Pozas, Mexico)"], ''The Guardian'', 6 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; — and a variety of small homes, niches, and pens that held exotic birds and wild animals from the world over—James owned many exotic animals and once even took his pet boa constrictors to the Hotel Francis in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="L&amp;T"/&gt;

Massive sculptures up to four stories tall punctuate the site. The many trails throughout the garden site are composed of steps, ramps, bridges and narrow, winding walkways that traverse the valley walls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stepsandfalls.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=28 "Los Pozas – steps and falls"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416080547/http://www.stepsandfalls.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=28 |date=2008-04-16 }}, virtual tour of the grounds of Las Pozas, DVD, published 2007; retrieved 30 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of Las Pozas cost more than $5 million. To pay for it, James sold his collection of surrealistic art at an auction.&lt;ref name="L&amp;T"/&gt;

In the summer of 2007, the Fundación Pedro y Elena Hernández, the company [[Cemex]], and the government of [[San Luis Potosí]] paid about $2.2 million for Las Pozas and created [http://www.xilitla.org Fondo Xilitla], a foundation that oversees the preservation and restoration of the site.&lt;ref name="NYT-30Mar08"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4833">The anonymous '''''Liber diversarum arcium''''' ('Book of various arts') is a [[medieval]] [[:Category:Art technological sources | handbook of painting]]. It contains over 500 art-technological instructions or recipes in [[Latin]], forming a complete structured painting course. It is probably the most substantial and comprehensive mediaeval [[:Category:Art technological sources | painters' technical recipe book]] to survive, and summarises the state of the art in the European workshops of the fourteenth century. In particular it is an important witness to the practice of [[oil painting]] before [[Van Eyck]]. The majority of the [[:Category:Art technological sources | recipes]] are unique.&lt;ref name=clarke&gt;Clarke, M. (2011) ''Mediaeval Painters’ Materials and Techniques: The Montpellier ‘Liber diversarum arcium’.'' London: Archetype Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Liber diversarum arcium'' is preserved in Manuscript H 277, fonds ancien, Bibliothèque interuniversitaire, section médecine, [[Montpellier]], [[France]] ([[Recto and verso|folios]] 81v-101v).&lt;ref&gt;Ravaisson, F. and Libri, G. (1849) ''Catalogue général des manuscrits des bibliothèques publiques des departments'', Vol. 1. Paris:  Imprimerie National, pp. 394–9, 739–811.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this manuscript dates from circa 1430 and was written in or near [[Venice]], in fact the textual core of the ''Liber diversarum arcium'' itself mainly reflects northern European practices, and probably dates from c.1300. This core consists partly of compilations of earlier technical recipes (but re-worked to make them more useful), and partly of newly composed material. During the fourteenth century various material (much of it Italian) was added to this core. &lt;ref name=clarke/&gt;

== Content ==
The text is substantial (26,000 words in Latin - thus containing far more on painting than the more famous ''[[Theophilus Presbyter]]''), and is unusual among medieval artists' recipe books in being highly structured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uhb.fr/alc/medieval/cd10/Oltrogge.pdf |format=PDF |last=Oltrogge |first=Doris |year=1998 |title=Cum sesto et rigula', l’organisation du savoir technologique dans le Liber diversarum artium de Montpellier et dans le De diversis artibus de Théophile, ''Cahiers Diderot'' 10: 67–99.

* Book I (the longest) describes the fundamentals of painting: [[drawing]], choice and preparation of [[pigment]]s, preparing media and [[tempera]], mixing pigments and modelling, and finally [[gilding]].
* Book II describes the advanced techniques, and the variations and refinements in technique, necessary for [[Oil paint|oil painting]] on wood: preparation of [[Panel painting|panels]], oils and [[varnish]]es, differences in the behaviour of [[pigment]]s in [[Oil paint|oil]], [[gilding]], imitation [[sgraffito]] etc.
* Book III (the shortest) describes the variations in technique and materials needed to paint [[mural]]s. 
* Book IV describes painting on glass and ceramics, and some other auxiliary decorative techniques: [[gilding]], [[silvering]] and colouring of metals, [[dyeing]] (principally for wood or skins), painting ceramics, [[Stained glass | painting glass]], and making and attaching [[artificial gem]]s.

Salaries for the highest Bengali paid film actors currently range from {{INRConvert|30|l}} to {{INRConvert|40|l}}, but an actor can earn substantially more by deferring all or part of their salary against a percentage of the film's gross, known within the industry as a "profit participation" deal. Since not all salaries are made public. The figures are given at their [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal value]], since earnings from profit based deals are accumulated over many years, making it unfeasible to adjust for [[inflation]].

A '''luckenbooth brooch''' is a Scottish heart-shaped [[brooch]]. These brooches often have a crown above one heart, or two intertwined hearts. They are typically made of silver and may be engraved or set with stones. 	[[File:Luckenbooth brooches .jpg|thumb|Scottish luckenbooth brooches 18th to 20th centuries]]

The name comes from the '''[[luckenbooths]]''' of [[Edinburgh]] where jewellery and trinkets used to be sold, including this type of brooch.&lt;ref name="Paton"&gt;James Paton, ''Scottish History and Life'', Maclehose 1902&lt;/ref&gt;
Luckenbooth is a [[Scots language|Scots]] word for a lockable stall or workshop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/dsl/getent4.php?xref=yes&amp;searchtype=full&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=all&amp;sset=1&amp;fset=20&amp;query=Lukkin-buthis Dictionary of the Scots Language: Lukkin-buthis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307094957/http://www.dsl.ac.uk/dsl/getent4.php?xref=yes&amp;searchtype=full&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=all&amp;sset=1&amp;fset=20&amp;query=Lukkin-buthis |date=7 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Edinburgh booths were situated on the [[Royal Mile]] near [[St Giles Cathedral]]. They were the city's first permanent shops, going back to the 15th century, and initially housing mainly silversmiths and goldsmiths. They were demolished in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edinburgh-royalmile.com/history/the-luckenbooths.html History of the Royal Mile: Luckenbooths]&lt;/ref&gt;

The luckenbooth brooch is a [[traditional]] [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[love token]]:&lt;ref name="Paton"/&gt; often given as a [[betrothal]] or [[wedding]] [[brooch]]. It might be worn by a [[Breastfeeding|nursing]] mother as a charm to help her milk flow,&lt;ref name="Paton"/&gt; and/or be pinned to a [[Infant clothing|baby's clothing]] to protect it from harm. It was known as a witch-brooch by people using it to save children from the [[evil eye]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120709133215/http://images.vam.ac.uk/item/O113816/brooch/ Victoria and Albert Museum: Scottish silver heart brooch]&lt;/ref&gt;

The luckenbooth brooch has [[motif (visual arts)|motif]]s similar to the [[Claddagh ring]], also using the [[heart]] and [[The Crown|crown]]. Heart-shaped brooches in parts of Europe date back to late [[medieval]] times, but this design probably did not appear in Scotland before the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Calder"&gt;Jenni Calder, ''The Wealth of a Nation'', National Museums of Scotland, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Anker, ''European Folk Art in Europe and the Americas'', McGraw-Hill, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

Silver was the usual material,&lt;ref name="Paton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calder"/&gt; although gold heart brooches were made for wealthy people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.vam.ac.uk/item/O113811/ring-brooch/ Victoria and Albert Museum: Scottish gold heart brooch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810090744/http://images.vam.ac.uk/item/O113811/ring-brooch/ |date=10 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver was commonly chosen for "lucky" charms, and was also an affordable metal for jewellery that was popular with poorer people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quezi.com/12874 Can a luckenbooth brooch have a heart but no crown?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405080128/http://quezi.com/12874 |date=5 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inexpensive glass paste "gems" were sometimes used on silver luckenbooth brooches, as were [[garnet]]s and semi-precious stones.&lt;ref name="Calder"/&gt; Some brooches were engraved with initials, dates or mottoes.&lt;ref name="Paton"/&gt;

By the mid 18th century luckenbooth tokens also featured heavily as trade [[silver]] items to the [[indigenous peoples of the Eastern Woodlands]], particularly the [[Iroquois]] of the [[Iroquois Confederacy|Six Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://heritage.scotsman.com/scotsincanada/Brooches-for-barter.2619605.jp Brooches for barter]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, luckenbooth brooches also became a common decorative symbol in 18th and early 19th century [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native]] clothing.

One legend of the luckenbooth brooch is that it was a symbol of love and devotion given by [[Mary Queen of Scots]] to [[Lord Darnley]]. Another story is that it was an engagement brooch given to her by the [[Francis II of France|Dauphin of France]] whom she later married. It may feature Scottish motifs like the [[saltire|St. Andrew's Cross]], or the thistle. 

The Luckenbooth brooch has been a self-consciously Scottish form of jewellery since the 19th century. The form was adapted to pebble jewellery in Victorian times, as well as being a regular feature in the ranges of most Scottish manufacturing jewellers who worked for the Highland outfitter and tourist trades. &lt;ref name="Stephen Walker"&gt; Stephen Walker (2013.)

Gender and Dance in Modern Iran, Biopolitics on stage. Routledge publication, Volume: 5 Issue: 2, page:13&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Lurish dances''' include a range of [[folk dance]]s popular among different groups of [[Lur people]] which have formed, developed and transferred during the subsequent generations. They  usually include common [[Iranian dance]]s; Collective dances and [[quadrille]], the circular arrangement ([[circle dance]]), and the colorful clothing.&lt;ref&gt;ثابت زاده، منصوره.

==History==
Due to discovered objects and archeological excavations from Lurish-inhabited areas like Kozagaran, Tepe Giyan, Tepe Musiyan, CheghaMish and [[Kul-e Farah]], it is evident that dance history predates the [[Arian]] migrations inward the [[Iranian plateau]].&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkel, Y.(2010) Dancing at the Dawn of Agriculture.University of Texas Publication, 346 pages, {{ISBN|9780292779969}}, Available online at: [https://books.google.de/books?id=50uCw0DcW_MC&amp;pg=RA1-PT387&amp;lpg=RA1-PT387&amp;dq=tepe+giyan+dance&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yjhwbYtC26&amp;sig=j-u_l8j1Fo3tYQbFdtj-jj874r0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiep5nPxLDUAhWHtBQKHSgFBG0Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tepe%20giyan%20dance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Contenau, G and R. Ghirshman (1935).Fouilles du Tepe Giyan, Paris: Librairie Orientaliste Paul Geuthner. Contenson, H. de. 1967. Troisieme campagne a Tell&lt;/ref&gt; Motifs depicting three dancing persons on the [[pottery]] discovered and  dance portrays on the bronze flags of [[Luristan]] of the first millennium BC, musicians and musical instruments depicted on the petroglyphs in [[Kul-e Farah]] of [[Izeh]] and Cheghamish are the most prominent archaeological evidences showing the value and history of dance in these areas.

==Styles==
There are many dance styles common in Lurish-inhabited areas. The most prevalent Lurish dance styles are handkerchief dance, Chupi dances (SanguinSama; slow rhythm along with strike and [[fiddle]], Se-Pa (three steps) dance that is performed faster than SanguinSama, and Du-Pa (Two steps) dance that is the fastest and the most exciting performance), and the stick dance (Çubâzi or Tarka-bâzi)(like Jitterbug wood) which is a martial show.&lt;ref&gt;Elton Daniel and AliAkbar Mahdi, 2006, Culture and Customs of Iran, Westport,Greenwood Press, 210 pages&lt;/ref&gt; Harvesting ceremony dances, PaPoshtePa dances, Suwaruna and the mourning dances are of less popular dances. Mourning dances are performed while loved persons are died as [[Chamariuna]] among [[Feylis]] and also among [[Great Lur]] tribes ([[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiries]] and the [[Southern Lurs]]).

===Dasmâl-bâzi (Handkerchief dance)===
[[File:Lur handkerchief dancer, Mamasani, Iran.jpg|thumb|250px| Handkerchief dancers in a wedding ceremony, Mamasani, Iran|right]]
Handkerchief dance also known as scarf dance ([[Lurish language|Lurish]]:Dasmâl-bâzi) is a vibrant [[circle dance]] style. This dance style is more common among [[Southern Lurs]] and [[Bakhtiari people]]. This style is usually performed by both male and female persons and includes different performing styles like Ashtafi-manganâ. Men or women may dance and wave colorful scarves, called dastmâl. A dasmâl is held in each hand. In case of the philosophy, it is believed that these dances have originated in the actions the women do in their daily livelihood. As the dance rhythm increases slowly, each person may chooses patterns to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://home.earthlink.net/~rcfriend/video-2.htm|title = Dances of Iran, Robyn Friend|date = 2000|accessdate = October 17, 2014|website = |publisher = Neil Siegel|last = Siegel|first = Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtiyari Dances, CD Number [174], Published [05/08/2004], Collected &amp; Researched by: Mansureh Sabetzadeh, available online at:[http://www.mahoor.com/cd/Folk-Music-Original/Bakhtiyari-Dances-211.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ču-bâzi (Twig dance)===
Ču-bâzi or Chubazi (twig dance) is a special [[dance double]] that is performed in the  celebrations and joys by [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]] and the [[southern Lurs]] and is inspired by the [[heroic]] battles.&lt;ref&gt;Elton Daniel and AliAkbar Mahdi, 2006, Culture and Customs of Iran, Westport,Greenwood Press, 210 pages&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually dance by two men, although sometimes is performed by the women too. One dancer (the defender) is equipped with a long heavy stick up to four or five feet long. The other (the attacker) whom holds a shorter flexible stick (tarka), has to attack the opponent only below the level of the knee. While the dance is accompanied by [[drum]] and [[karnâ]] (a horn music instrument), the defender is only allowed to escape the strike by leaping up in the air. The contributors change in turn till the protagaonists are specified.&lt;ref&gt;David Brooks, The enemy within: limitations on leadership in the Bakhtiari, in The Conflict of Tribes and State in Iran and Afghanistan, ed: Richard Tapper, London, 1983, pp 15-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The dancers are surrounded by female and male enthusiastic audiences whom cheer the winners by screams and whistles.

===Čupi (Choupi)===
[[File:A Feyli Lurish Čupi dancer.jpg|thumb|A Feyli Lur woman, performing Čupi dance]]
In [[Lurish language|Lurish]] dialects, mass dance styles that are mainly based on leg movements are said Čupi (چووپی, Choupi). Mixed male and female dancers hold hands to form rings, hearing the vibrant musics by musicians, they perform different styles of čupi. The leader performer (Sarčupi or Čupikeš) is a skillful dancer whose duty is to lead others and warm up them in accordance with dance music rhythms. Other performers should coordinate the movements and body rhythms with the leader. The dance usually starts with Sangin-Samâ rhythm which is performed slowly, following Sepâ (Three steps) the next rhythm with faster performing and soars when vibrant Dopâ (two steps) is performing. After a while, the dance concludes to Sangin-Samâ movements in a reversed trend.&lt;ref&gt;گژک, تارنمای اینترنتی تبار لر. [http://www.gezhek.ir/38«"رقص لری (چوپی)".»]. (۱۰ اردیبهشت ۱۳۹۴ )&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;پایگاه خبری گلونی. [http://golvani.ir/1395/05/%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%B1%D9%82%D8%B5%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%84%D9%8F%D8%B1%DB%8C/«"انواع رقصهای لری »]. (۲۳ مرداد ۱۳۹۵)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sangin-Samâ====
Sangin-samâ (also Sangin-sepâ or Samâ) is usually the first phase of Čupi mass dance style and includes gentle and slow movements. Performers, initially put their right foot in the form of a cross with left foot, then take it  and take two steps forward. Then they put the left foot with the tip of the toe and finally put it aside right foot. The hands bend from elbow and small fingers of dancers, in line with the shoulders, are tied among each other. It seems that each of the gestures and dance components of Sama, has a philosophy retrieved from thousands years of coexistence with humane and natural elements behind it.&lt;ref&gt;Mortezai Darikvand, Ali. [http://www.goftarema.ir/%D9%81%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%81%D9%87-%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D9%84%D8%B1%DB%8C-%DA%AF%D9%81%D8%AA-%D9%88%DA%AF%D9%88-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AA/ "The Philosophy Behind the Lurish Samâ dance"], ''Goftare Mâ, Information Agency'', Tehran, 12 February 2016. Retrieved on 27 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sepâ====
[[File:Čupi Dance by Feyli Lurs in Sweden.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Čupi Dance by Feyli Lurs in Sweden]]
In Čupi dance continuum, the second phase is Sepâ (three steps) which is performed faster and more dynamic than Sangin-Samâ in accordance with speeding up the music rhythm. Dancers start the dance with the right foot and take three steps forward. In Lurish dances, like most Iranian group dances, the start of the move is with the right foot. After removing the three steps, the dancers first bend the right leg and then the left foot. The dancers' hands in this dance are tied to each other and their shoulders rely on each other. The literal meaning of dance in [[Lurish language|Lurish]] (Dasgerta), is the bond between hands when dancing.

}}'''Mark Podwal''' (born June 8, 1945) is an artist, author, filmmaker and physician. He may be best known for his drawings on [[The New York Times]] OP-ED page.  In addition, he is the author and illustrator of books for children as well as for adults. Most of these works — Podwal's own as well as those he has illustrated for others—typically focus on Jewish legend, history and tradition.&lt;ref name="[[Cynthia Ozick]]"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ozick|first1=Cynthia|authorlink=Cynthia Ozick|title=Master of the True Line Cynthia Ozick introduces artist Mark Podwal’s new collected works|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/212389/master-of-the-true-line|accessdate=9 September 2016|publisher=[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]|date=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exhibited in galleries and museums throughout the world, his art is represented in the collections of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the [[Carnegie Museum of Art]], [[Fogg Art Museum]], the [[Jewish Museum in Prague]], and the [[Library of Congress]].

Beyond his works on paper, Podwal’s artistry has been employed in an array of diverse projects, including the design of a series of decorative plates for the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]: ''Passover Plate'', ''Zodiac Platter'' (Met Bestseller), and  ''Life Cycle'' (Met Bestseller).  His work has been animated for public television in ''A Passover Seder with Elie Wiesel'' (Time Warner), engraved on a [[Congressional Gold Medal]] presented by President Reagan to Elie Wiesel, and woven into an Aubusson tapestry that adorns the ark in the main sanctuary of [[Congregation Emanu-El of New York|Congregation Emanu-El of the City of New York]].  Moreover, he designed sixteen kiln cast glass panels for the United Jewish Appeal Federation Headquarters in New York. Podwal collaborated with Academy Award winning filmmaker Allan Miller on the documentary [http://www.houseoflifefilm.com ''House of Life: The Old Jewish Cemetery in Prague''], narrated by Claire Bloom.  In 2009 and 2010, the film was broadcast on PBS.  Podwal's portraits of Mozart in costumes from his operas were published as a boxed set of greeting cards by the [[Metropolitan Opera]].

In conjunction with the [[Anti-Defamation League]], Podwal began ''The Jerusalem Sky Project'', a program that fosters tolerance and awareness by bringing together young children from the Jewish, Islamic, and Christian communities.  Participating religious schools study Podwal's ''Jerusalem Sky'' in their classrooms, and then encourage their students to illustrate their own depictions of Jerusalem.  Amidst the learning, the children of each school write to or meet with their counterparts at a school of another faith and begin to learn about each other's religion and culture.  After a few weeks, the program culminates with an exhibition of all of the drawings from each of the schools.  At the opening of the exhibition, the children meet to enjoy each other's art and company.  In a 2005 article called "Three Faiths, One Lesson", the ''New York Times'' covered the completion of the program at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] in Brooklyn, NY.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/20/arts/design/20mosa.html "Three Faiths, One Lesson"]&lt;/ref&gt; The project has since also been carried out in Los Angeles, CA, and Binghamton, NY.

In 2011, Podwal received commissions to illustrate a new Passover ''[[Haggadah]]'' for the Central Conference of American Rabbis Press; to design new embroidered textiles for Prague's 700-year-old [[Old New Synagogue|Altneuschul]]; to create a limited edition print for the Metropolitan Opera's production of ''Nabucco''; and to design ''[[Hanukkah]]'' cards for the Metropolitan Museum and the Metropolitan Opera. Also in 2011, he received the Jewish Cultural Achievement Award from the [[Foundation for Jewish Culture]].

In 2014, the Terezin Ghetto Museum exhibited Podwal’s cycle ''All This Has Come Upon Us'', a series of 42 paintings and drawings created especially for that venue.&lt;ref name="Kestenbaum"&gt;Kestenbaum, Gloria (October&amp;nbsp;23, 2014). "[http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/an-illustrated-saga-of-the-diaspora/ An Illustrated Saga of the Diaspora]". ''[[The Jewish Week]]''. jewishweek.timesofisrael.com. Retrieved November&amp;nbsp;24, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
The works, which span Jewish history from the destruction of the two temples in Jerusalem, through the history of [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] and persecution in Europe, culminating in the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], have been described by the artist as offering "a disturbing reminder of how Europe’s extensive history of 'Jew-hatred' laid the groundwork for Terezin and Auschwitz".&lt;ref name="Kestenbaum"/&gt; The series has been published as a portfolio of archival pigment prints,&lt;ref name="Kestenbaum"/&gt; which has been acquired by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Library of Congress, Yad Vashem, the Bodleian Library, the British Library, the Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard University, Yale University, [[Princeton University Library]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All This Has Come Upon Us|url=https://graphicarts.princeton.edu/2014/10/08/all-this-has-come-upon-us/|website=Graphic Arts Collection, Rare Books and Special Collections, Firestone Library|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia University, Hebrew University, and the National Library of Israel, among many others.

In 2015, Mark Podwal was commissioned to design new textiles for the restored synagogue in the Czech city of [[Brno]]. At Prague's [[Clementinum|Klementinum]], Podwal's series ''Mozart and Prague'' was exhibited along with Mozart's handwritten manuscripts.

In 2016, Glitterati Inc. published a 374-page monograph on his work, ''Reimagined: 45 Years of Jewish Art''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2755">'''Mosan Renaissance''', also known as '''Maasland Renaissance''', is a regional [[architectural style]] dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. The style is only remotely related to [[Renaissance architecture]]. The term should not be confused with [[Mosan art]], which applies to [[Romanesque art]] and [[Romanesque architecture|architecture]] during the [[Middle Ages]] in the [[Meuse river]] region.

The style has been applied predominantly in the [[Principality of Liège]] in present-day [[Belgium]] and [[the Netherlands]], mainly in the city of [[Liège]], the [[Land of Herve]], and the regions of [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian Limburg]] and Dutch [[South Limburg (Netherlands)|South Limburg]]. The style is manifested in townhouses, [[castle]]s, farms, [[manor house]]s, and sometimes in [[monastery|monasteries]].

The Mosan Renaissance style developed in Liège in the 16th century during the reign of [[Erard de la Marck]]. The style is a take on earlier used methods of [[timber framing]] into which a new material (stone) has been incorporated. Stone-framed windows, decorated [[architrave]]s and alternating layers of [[brick]] and stone are characteristic of the style. Most utilised materials were endemic to the regions where the style prevailed, namely blue [[limestone]] (also known as  [[Namur (province)|Namur]] stone), brick and [[marl|mergel]] (a type of [[chalk]]).

'''''My Dog Skip''''' is a memoir by [[Willie Morris]] published by [[Random House]] in 1995.

[[File:My Dog Skip.jpeg|thumb|Cover of movie novelization]]
''My Dog Skip'' is the story  about nine-year-old Willie Morris growing up in [[Yazoo City, Mississippi]], a tale of a boy and his dog in a small, sleepy Southern town that teaches us about family, friendship, love, devotion, trust and bravery. Willie and Skip's relationship goes beyond that of owner and dog, but is a relationship recognized and celebrated by the entire town.

In 2000, the book was made into [[My Dog Skip (film)|a film of the same name]]. Although Skip was a [[Fox Terrier]], a number of [[Jack Russell terrier]]s were used in filming, two of which were [[Moose (dog actor)|Moose]], and Moose's son [[Enzo (dog actor)|Enzo]] who both portrayed Eddie on NBC's sitcom ''[[Frasier]]''.

The original dog in the book, Skip, was actually a Smooth Haired Fox Terrier, and not a Jack Russell portrayed in the movie.

==History and leadership==
NADA was founded in 2002 by board members Sheri L. Pasquarella, John Connelly, Zach Miner, and [[Zach Feuer Gallery|Zach Feuer]] as a collective of young art professionals predominately based in New York.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/23/arts/how-an-art-scene-became-a-youthscape.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/features/n_9551/&lt;/ref&gt; After a successful inaugural year of NADA Miami Beach, held in December 2003, Heather Hubbs was appointed the Director of NADA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/december-2-5-2004-in-miami/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, NADA launched the New York edition of its art fair, NADA New York.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artspace.com/magazine/interviews_features/qa/nada_collection-5128&lt;/ref&gt;

NADA is a [[501(c)]] 6 nonprofit organization.

==Membership==
NADA members are part of an alliance and collective of international galleries, non-profit art spaces, advisors, curators, and other professionals working with contemporary art. NADA hosts year-round programming for members, including workshops, conferences, panel discussions, collection visits, performances, and parties.&lt;ref&gt;newartdealers.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phaidon.com/agenda/art/articles/2014/january/08/join-nada-and-phaidon-in-new-york-this-sunday/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bfa.com/events/12963&lt;/ref&gt;

==NADA Miami==
NADA first launched the art fair concurrent with [[Art Basel]] in Miami in 2003, with a small number of exhibiting galleries in a vacant space located off of Lincoln Road near the Convention Center.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/news/artnetnews2/artnetnews10-14-03.asp&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, NADA director Heather Hubbs moved the fair to the Ice Palace,&lt;ref&gt;http://artforum.com/diary/id=8023&lt;/ref&gt; where the fair was held for five years.&lt;ref&gt;http://newartdealers.org/Fairs/2013/MiamiBeach&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, NADA Miami Beach moved the Deauville Beach Resort.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/05/arts/design/05artbasel.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, NADA held the fair at [[Fontainebleau Miami Beach]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/abinlot/2015/04/07/nada-miami-beach-moves-to-the-fontainebleau/&lt;/ref&gt;, and has since returned to Ice Palace Studios.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/claytonpress/2017/12/04/nada-miami-art-fair-at-ice-palace-film-studios-miami-florida/#761924be349f&lt;/ref&gt;

==NADA New York==
The first NADA New York opened at the Center 548, the former [[Dia Art Foundation]] Center, in 2012, simultaneous with the Frieze Art Fair.&lt;ref&gt;http://observer.com/2012/01/nada-will-hold-a-fair-in-new-york-in-may-2012-2/&lt;/ref&gt; From 2013–2016, the fair was held at Pier 36 Basketball City on the Lower East Side. NADA New York has since moved its dates to March, and has moved to the Skylight venues on the west side.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/arts/design/nada-nyc-art-fair-at-basketball-city.html&lt;/ref&gt; Like the fair in Miami, NADA New York is dedicated to showcasing new art, and celebrating rising talents from around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;http://newartdealers.org/Fairs/2015/NewYork&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional programs==
From 2012–2016 NADA partnered with [[Art Cologne]], the world's oldest art fair,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cologne-tourism.com/welcome/news/archive/2015/art-cologne.html&lt;/ref&gt; to showcase emerging galleries from around the world at [[Koelnmesse]] during Art Cologne.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/new-art-dealers-alliance-nada-cologne-2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, NADA announced COLLABORATIONS, a curated sector of Art Cologne in which exhibitors present with the theme of collaboration as a starting point, often co-presenting in a shared booth.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVlHAyMKUg&lt;/ref&gt;

NADA has organized events such as NADA Hudson, a sculpture exhibition at the [[Basilica Hudson]],&lt;ref&gt;http://hyperallergic.com/55011/nada-hudson-2012/&lt;/ref&gt; NADA County Affair, a recurring artist-run county fair,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interviewmagazine.com/art/nada-county-fair&lt;/ref&gt; and fundraising events such as the Beach Painting Club Auction to benefit the Rockaways&lt;ref&gt;http://observer.com/2013/09/reeder-brothers-beach-painting-club-raises-money-for-rockaways&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Wave''' is a movement in [[science fiction]] produced in the 1960s and 1970s and characterized by a high degree of experimentation, both in form and in content, a "literary" or artistic sensibility, and a focus on "[[Soft science fiction|soft]]" as opposed to hard science. New Wave writers often saw themselves as part of the [[Literary modernism|modernist]] tradition and sometimes mocked the traditions of [[Pulp magazine|pulp]] science fiction, which some of them regarded as stodgy, adolescent and poorly written.&lt;ref&gt;Moorcock, Michael. "Play with Feeling." ''New Worlds'' 129 (April 1963), pp. 123-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The New Wave science fiction of the 1960s emphasized stylistic experimentation and literary merit over scientific accuracy or prediction. It was conceived as a deliberate break from the traditions of pulp SF, which many of the writers involved considered irrelevant and unambitious. It was, according to academic [[Brian McHale]], the edge of science fiction which ambitioned it to reach literary status, making it a case, among all of the arts, which were to constitute the emergence of [[postmodernism]].

The most prominent source of New Wave science fiction was the magazine ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]'' under the editorship of [[Michael Moorcock]], who assumed the position in 1964. Moorcock sought to use the magazine to "define a new avant-garde role" for science fiction&lt;ref&gt;Stableford, Brian (November 1996). "The Third Generation of Genre Science Fiction". Science Fiction Studies 23 (3): 321–330&lt;/ref&gt; by the use of "new literary techniques and modes of expression."&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, Mike, (2005), ''Transformations. The Story of the Science Fiction Magazines from 1950 to 1970'', pp251-252&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a period marked by the emergence of a greater variety of voices in science fiction, most notably the rise in the number of female writers, including  [[Joanna Russ]], [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] and [[James Tiptree, Jr.]].

== Name ==
The term "New Wave" is borrowed from the French film movement the ''[[nouvelle vague]]''.&lt;ref name="wolf"&gt;Wolfe, Gary G (2005) "Coming to Terms" in ''Speculations on Speculation. Theories of Science Fiction'', James Gunn and Matthew Candelaria (Ed.), Scarecrow Press Inc, Maryland&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gary K. Wolfe]], professor of humanities and English at [[Roosevelt University]], identifies the introduction of the term New Wave to science fiction&lt;ref name="wolf"/&gt; as occurring in 1966 in an essay&lt;ref&gt;Merril, Judith (1966) "Books", pp. 30, ''The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction'', January 1966&lt;/ref&gt; for ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'' written by [[Judith Merril]],  who was indirectly yet it seems unambiguously referring to that term in order to comment on the experimental fiction that had begun to appear in the English magazine ''New Worlds'', after Michael Moorcock assumed editorship in 1964. However, Judith Merril denied she ever used that term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friendsofmerril.org/sol19.html The 1997 Academic Conference On Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128100755/http://www.friendsofmerril.org/sol19.html |date=2012-01-28 }}, Allan Weiss, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Merril later popularized this fiction in the United States through her edited anthology ''England Swings SF: Stories of Speculative Fiction'' (Doubleday 1968), although an earlier anthology ([[Harlan Ellison]]'s ''[[Dangerous Visions]]'' [Doubleday 1967]) is a key harbinger of New Wave science fiction in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfsite.com/03b/dv148.htm The SF Site featured review: Dangerous Visions], accessed May 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sffworld.com/brevoff/816.html Dangerous visions by Harlan Ellison: Official SFWorld.com review], accessed May 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the New Wave began in the 1960s, some of its tenets can be found in [[H. L. Gold]]'s editorship of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]'', a science fiction magazine which began publication in 1950. [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]] described Gold's focus as being "not on the adventurer, the inventor, the engineer, or the scientist, but on the average citizen,"&lt;ref&gt;Gunn, James. "Alternate Worlds: 1949–1965", in Alternate Worlds. The Illustrated History of Science Fiction (N.J.:Prentice-Hall, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; and according to SF historian David Kyle, Gold's work would lead to the New Wave.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, A Pictorial History of Science Fiction, pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Algis Budrys]] in 1965 wrote of the "recurrent strain in 'Golden Age' science fiction of the 1940's—the implication that sheer technological accomplishment would solve all the problems, hooray, and that all the problems were what they seemed to be on the surface".&lt;ref name="budrys196508"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Wave did not define itself as a development from the science fiction which came before it, but initially reacted against it. New Wave writers did not operate as an organized group, but some of them felt the tropes of the pulp and [[Golden Age of Science Fiction|Golden Age]] periods had become worn out, and should be abandoned: [[J. G. Ballard]] stated in 1962 that "science fiction should turn its back on space, on interstellar travel, extra-terrestrial life forms, (and) galactic wars",&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, J. G. (1962) "Which Way to Inner Space?" ''New Worlds Science Fiction'', May. Reprinted in ''A User's Guide to the Millennium: Essays and Reviews'', HarperCollins, London  (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and Brian Aldiss said in ''Trillion Year Spree: The History of Science Fiction'' that "the props of SF are few: rocket ships, telepathy, robots, time travel...like coins, they become debased by over-circulation."&lt;ref&gt;Aldiss, Brian and David Wingrove (eds.). ''Trillion Year Spree. The History of Science Fiction'' (London: Paladin Grafton, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]] summarised the period by saying "old barriers were coming down, pulp taboos were being forgotten, new themes and new manners of writing were being explored".&lt;ref&gt;Brian Aldiss and Harry Harrison (eds.) ''Decade the 1950s'' (London: Pan Books, 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

New Wave writers began to look outside the traditional scope of science fiction for influence; some looked to the example of beat writer [[William S. Burroughs]] – New Wave authors [[Philip José Farmer]] and [[Barrington J. Bayley]] wrote pastiches of his work ("The Jungle Rot Kid on the Nod" and "The Four Colour Problem", respectively), while J. G. Ballard published an admiring essay in an issue of ''New Worlds''.&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, J. G. "Myth Maker Of The 20th century" New Worlds, No. 142, May/June 1964&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs' use of experimentation such as the [[cut-up technique]] and his appropriation of science fiction tropes in radical ways proved the extent to which prose fiction could prove revolutionary, and some New Wave writers sought to emulate this style.

[[Ursula K. Le Guin]], one of the writers to emerge in the 1960s, describes the transition to the New Wave era thus:

{{quote|Without in the least dismissing or belittling earlier writers and work, I think it is fair to say that science fiction changed around 1960, and that the change tended toward an increase in the number of writers and readers, the breadth of subject, the depth of treatment, the sophistication of language and technique, and the political and literary consciousness of the writing. The sixties in science fiction were an exciting period for both established and new writers and readers. All the doors seemed to be opening.&lt;ref&gt;Le Guin, Ursula K. "Introduction". In Ursula K. Le Guin and Brian Attebery (eds.), ''The Norton Book of Science Fiction'', (New York: W. W. Norton, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}} }}

Critic [[Rob Latham]] identifies three trends that linked the advent of the New Wave in the 1960s to the emergence of [[cyberpunk]] in the 1980s. He said that changes in technology as well as an economic [[Recession of 1958|recession]] constricted the market for science fiction, generating a "widespread" malaise among fans, while established writers were forced to reduce their output (or, like [[Isaac Asimov]], shifted their emphasis to other subjects); finally, editors encouraged fresh approaches that earlier ones discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Latham, Rob (2007) "Cyberpunk and the New Wave: Ruptures and Continuities", ''New York Review of Science Fiction'', June, Number 226, Vol. 19, No. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movement===

There is no consensus on a precise starting point of the New Wave – [[Adam Roberts (British writer)|Adam Roberts]] refers to [[Alfred Bester]] as having singlehandedly invented the genre,&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Adam. The History of Science Fiction (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the introduction to a collection of [[Leigh Brackett]]'s short fiction, Michael Moorcock referred to her as one of the genre's "true godmothers".&lt;ref&gt;Brackett, Leigh (2000) ''Martian Quest: The Early Brackett'', Haffner Press (introduction)&lt;/ref&gt; Budrys said that in New Wave writers "there are echoes ... of [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Walter Miller, Jr.]] and, by all odds, [[Fritz Leiber]]".&lt;ref name="budrys196710"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is widely accepted among critics that the New Wave began in England with the magazine ''New Worlds'' and [[Michael Moorcock]]. who was appointed editor in 1964 (first issue number 142, May and June&lt;ref&gt;Greenland, Colin. ''The Entropy Exhibition'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1983 {{ISBN|978-0-7100-9310-3}}).

Theories of Science Fiction'' (Maryland: Scarecrow Press Inc., 2005). Page number refer to this reprint&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|251}})&lt;ref group="note"&gt;
For example:

1) Luckhurst, Roger. ''Science Fiction'' (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2005)

"What became known as the New Wave in SF was centred in England on the Magazine ''New Worlds'', edited with missionary zeal by Michael Moorcock between 1964 and 1970 …"{{rp|141}}

2) James, Edward. ''Science Fiction in the 20th century'' (Oxford University Press, 1994)

"In April 1963 Michael Moorcock contributes a guest editorial to John Carnell's ''New Worlds'', Britain's leading SF magazine, which effectively announced the onset of the New Wave."{{rp|167}}

3) Roberts, Adam. ''The History of Science Fiction'' (New York: Palgrove Macmillan, 2005)

"It [the New Wave] was initially associated with the London magazine ''New Worlds'', … which was reconfigured as a venue for experimental and unconventional fiction in the 1960s, particularly under the editorship of Michael Moorcock from 1964 …"{{rp|231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the American magazines ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', with Cele Goldsmith as editor, and ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction|Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'' had from the start printed unusually literary stories, Moorcock turned that into a concerted policy. No other science fiction magazine sought as consistently to distance itself from traditional science fiction as much as ''New Worlds''. By the time it ceased regular publication it had backed away from the science fiction genre itself, styling itself as an [[experimental fiction|experimental]] [[literary journal]].

Under Moorcock's editorship "galactic wars went out; drugs came in; there were fewer encounters with aliens, more in the bedroom. Experimentation in prose styles became one of the orders of the day, and the baleful influence of William Burroughs often threatened to gain the upper hand."&lt;ref name="aldiss1"&gt;Aldiss, Brian W. ''The Detached Retina'' (Liverpool University Press, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}} [[Judith Merril]] observed:

{{quote| this magazine [''New Worlds''] was the publishing thermometer of the trend that was dubbed "the New Wave". In the United States the trend created an intense, incredible controversy. In Britain people either found it of interest or they didn't, but in the States it was heresy on the one hand and wonderful revolution on the other.&lt;ref name="merril1" /&gt;{{rp|162–163}}}} As an anthologist and speaker Merril with other authors advocated a reestablishment of science fiction within the literary mainstream and higher literary standards. Her "incredible controversy" is characterized by David Hartwell in the opening sentence of a book chapter entitled "New Wave: The Great War of the 1960s": "Conflict and argument are an enduring presence in the SF world, but literary politics has yielded to open warfare on the largest scale only once."&lt;ref name="hart1"&gt;Hartwell, David. ''Age of Wonders'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|141}} The heresy was beyond the experimental and explicitly provocative as inspired by Burroughs. In all coherence with the literary ''nouvelle vague'' although not in close association to it, and addressing a much less restricted pool of readers, the New Wave was reversing the standard hero's attitude toward action and science. It illustrated egotism - by depriving the plot of all motivation toward a rational explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Gunn, James (2005) "The Readers of Hard Science Fiction" in Speculations on Speculation. Theories of Science Fiction, James Gunn and Matthew Candelaria (Ed.), Scarecrow Press Inc, Maryland :87&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 Moorcock wrote:

{{quote|Let's have a quick look at what a lot of science fiction lacks. Briefly, these are some of the qualities I miss on the whole – passion, subtlety, irony, original characterization, original and good style, a sense of involvement in human affairs, colour, density, depth, and, on the whole, real feeling from the writer...&lt;ref&gt;Moorcock, Michael. "Guest Editorial", ''New Worlds'', 129 (April 1963), 2 and 123. Reprinted in: James, Edward. ''Science Fiction in the 20th century'' (Oxford University Press, page 168, 1994,)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1962 Ballard wrote:

{{quote| I've often wondered why s-f shows so little of the experimental enthusiasm which has characterized painting, music and the cinema during the last four or five decades, particularly as these have become wholeheartly speculative, more and more concerned with the creation of new states of mind, constructing fresh symbols and languages where the old cease to be valid. …
The biggest developments of the immediate future will take place, not on the Moon or Mars, but on Earth, and it is ''inner space'', not outer, that need to be explored. The only truly alien planet is Earth. In the past the scientific bias of s-f has been towards the physical sciences – rocketry, electronics, cybernetics – and the emphasis should switch to the biological sciences. Accuracy, that last refuge of the unimaginative, doesn't matter a hoot. …

It is that ''inner'' space-suit which is still needed, and it is up to science fiction to build it!&lt;ref name="ballard1" /&gt;{{rp|197}}}}

Moorcock, Ballard, and others engendered much animosity from the established SF community.{{cn|date=December 2017}} When reviewing ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', [[Lester del Rey]] described it as "the first of the New Wave-Thing movies, with the usual empty symbolism".&lt;ref name="delrey196807"&gt;{{Cite magazine

{{quote|A story by J. G. Ballard, as you know, calls for people who don't think. One begins with characters who regard the physical universe as a mysterious and arbitrary place, and who would not dream of trying to understand its actual laws. Furthermore, in order to be the protagonist of a J. G. Ballard novel, or anything more than a very minor character therein, you must have cut yourself off from the entire body of scientific education. In this way, when the world disaster – be it wind or water – comes upon you, you are under absolutely no obligation to do anything about it but sit and worship it. Even more further, some force has acted to remove from the face of the world all people who might impose good sense or rational behavior on you, so that the disaster proceeds unchecked and unopposed except by the almost inevitable thumb-rule engineer type who for his individual comfort builds a huge pyramid (without huge footings) to resist high winds, or trains a herd of alligators and renegade divers to help him out in dealing with deep water.{{r|budrys196612}}}}

Despite his criticism of Ballard and Aldiss ("the least talented" of the four), Budrys called them, [[Roger Zelazny]], and [[Samuel R. Delany]] "an earthshaking new kind" of writers.{{r|budrys196710}} Asimov said in 1967 of the New Wave, "I want science fiction. I think science fiction isn't really science fiction if it lacks science. And I think the better and truer the science, the better and truer the science fiction",{{r|asimov196708}} but Budrys that year warned that the four would soon leave those "still reading everything from the viewpoint of the 1944 ''[[Astounding Science Fiction|Astounding]]'' ... nothing but a complete collection of yellowed, crumble-edged bewilderment".{{r|budrys196710}} While acknowledging the New Wave's "energy, high talent and dedication", and stating that it "may in fact be the shape of tomorrow's science fiction generally — hell, it may be the shape of today's science fiction", as examples of the movement Budrys much preferred Zelazny's ''[[This Immortal]]'' to [[Thomas Disch]]{{'}}s ''The Genocide''. Predicting that Zelazny's career would be more important and lasting than Disch's, he described the latter's book as "unflaggingly derivative of" the New Wave and filled with "dumb, resigned victims" who "run, hide, slither, grope and die", like Ballard's ''[[The Drowned World]]'' but unlike ''[[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]'' ("about people who do something about their troubles").&lt;ref name="budrys196612"&gt;{{Cite magazine

Roger Luckhurst pointed out that Ballard's essay "Which Way to Inner Space?"&lt;ref name="ballard1"&gt;Ballard, J. G. "Which Way to Inner Space?", ''New Worlds'', 118 (May 1962), 117. Reprinted in: Ballard, J. G.

Another central concern of the New Wave was a fascination with [[entropy]]{{r|budrys196612}} –  that the world (and the universe) must tend to disorder, to eventually run down to 'heat death'. Ballard provided

{{quote|an explicitly cosmological vision of entropic decline of the universe in his magisterial story "The Voices of Time", which appeared in 1960. It provided a matrix of ideas that subsequent New Wave writing teased out in various contexts. Perhaps the best instance of this elaboration was [[Pamela Zoline]]'s "The Heat Death of the Universe."&lt;ref name="ballard1" /&gt;{{rp|158}}}}

Like other writers for ''New Worlds'' Zoline uses "science-fictional and scientific language and imagery to describe perfectly 'ordinary' scenes of life", and by doing so produces "altered perceptions of reality in the reader."&lt;ref name="james"&gt;James, Edward. ''Science Fiction in the 20th century'' (Oxford University Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|172}}

Judith Merril, "whose annual anthologies were the first heralds of the coming of the [New Wave] cult,"&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim, Donald A. ''The Universe Makers. Science Fiction Today'' (London: Victor Gollancz, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|105}} writing in 1967 in ''The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction'' contrasts the SF New Wave (which she here terms 'The New Thing') in England and the United States:

{{quote|They call it the New Thing.

The people who call it that mostly don't like it, and the only general agreements they seem to have are that Ballard is its Demon and I am its prophetess – and that it is what is wrong with Tom Disch, and with British s-f in general. …

The American counterpart is less cohesive as a "school" or "movement": it has had no single publication in which to concentrate its development, and was, in fact, till recently, all but excluded from the regular s-f magazines. But for the same reasons, it is more diffuse and perhaps more widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Merril, Judith. "Books" ''The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction'', November 1967&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}}}}

Judith Merril's annual anthologies (1957–1968&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bestsf.net/category/reviews/years-best/merril/ "Best SF - reviews and contents of Merril anthologies"] Retrieved 2011-01-27&lt;/ref&gt;), Damon Knight's ''[[Orbit (anthology series)|Orbit]]'' series, and Harlan Ellison's ''Dangerous Visions'' featured American writers inspired by British writers (although some of the writers anthologized were British).&lt;ref name="landon"&gt;Landon, Brooks. ''Science Fiction after 1900. From the Steam Man to the Stars'' (New York: Twayne Publishers, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|156}} Brooks Landon, professor of English at the University of Iowa, says of ''Dangerous Visions'' that it

{{quote|was innovative and influential before it had any readers simply because it was the first big original anthology of SF, offering prices to its writers that were competitive with the magazines. The readers soon followed, however, attracted by 33 stories by SF writers both well-established and relatively unheard of. These writers responded to editor Harlan Ellison's call for stories that could not be published elsewhere or had never been written in the face of almost certain censorship by SF editors. Among the stories Ellison received were the almost [[James Joyce|Joycean]] "[[Riders of the Purple Wage]]," by [[Philip Jose Farmer]], "[[Carcinoma Angels]]", by [[Norman Spinrad]], and "[[Aye, and Gomorrah]]…" by [[Samuel R. Delany]], as well as stories by [[Brian Aldiss]], Philip K. Dick, J. G. Ballard, [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], [[John Sladek]], Roger Zelazny, [[David R.

''Dangerous Visions'' marks an emblematic turning point for American SF.&lt;ref name="landon" /&gt;{{rp|157}}}}

The New Wave also had a political subtext:

{{quote|Most of the 'classic' writers had begun writing before the Second World War, and were reaching middle age by the early 1960s; the writers of the so-called New Wave were mostly born during or after the war, and were not only reacting against the sf writers of the past, but playing their part in the general youth revolution of the 1960s which had such profound effects upon Western culture. It is no accident that the New Wave began in Britain at the time of [[the Beatles]], and took off in the United States at the time of the [[hippies]] – both, therefore at a time of cultural innovation and generational shake-up …&lt;ref name="james" /&gt;{{rp|167}}}}

[[Eric S. Raymond]], looking at the New Wave with an even narrower political focus, observed:

{{quote|The New Wave's inventors (notably Michael Moorcock, J. G. Ballard and Brian Aldiss) were British socialists and Marxists who rejected individualism, linear exposition, happy endings, scientific rigor and the U.S.'s [[cultural hegemony]] over the SF field in one fell swoop. The New Wave's later American exponents were strongly associated with the New Left and opposition to the Vietnam War, leading to some rancorous public disputes in which politics was tangled together with definitional questions about the nature of SF and the direction of the field.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Eric S. [http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/sf-history.html "A Political History of SF"] Retrieved 2010-10-10&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For example, Judith Merril, "one of the most visible -- and voluble -- apostles of the New Wave in 1960s sf"&lt;ref name="latham2"&gt;Latham, Rob. "Sextrapolation in New Wave Science Fiction", ''Science Fiction Studies'', Vol. 33, No. 2 (Jul., 2006), pp. 251–274: page 251&lt;/ref&gt; remembers her return from England to the United States:

{{quote|So I went home ardently looking for a revolution. I kept searching until the [[1968 Democratic Convention|Chicago Democratic Convention in 1968]]. I went to Chicago partly to seek out a revolution, if there was one happening, and partly because my seventeen-year-old daughter … wanted to go.&lt;ref name="merril1" /&gt;{{rp|167}}}}

Merril said later "At the end of the Convention week, the taste of America was sour in all our mouths,"&lt;ref name="merril1"&gt;Merril, Judith. ''Better to have Loved. The Life of Judith Merril'' (Toronto: Between the Lines, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|169}} and "by the end of the Sixties, Merril was a political refugee living in Canada."&lt;ref name="hart1" /&gt;{{rp|142}}

Roger Luckhurst disagreed with those critics (he gives the example of Thomas Clareson) who perceived the New Wave in terms of rupture, suggesting that such a model

{{quote|doesn't quite seem to map onto the American scene, even though the wider conflicts of the 1960s liberalization in universities, the civil rights movement and the cultural contradictions inherent in consumer society were starker and certainly more violent than in Britain. The young turks within SF also had an ossified 'ancient regime' to topple: [[John W. Campbell|John Campbell]]'s intolerant right-wing editorials for 'Astounding Science Fiction' (which he renamed 'Analog' in 1960) teetered on the self parody. In 1970, when the campus revolt against American involvement in Vietnam reached its height and resulted in the [[Kent State shootings|National Guard shooting four students dead in Kent State University]], Campbell editorialized that the 'punishment was due', and rioters should expect to be met with lethal force. Vietnam famously divided the SF community to the extent that, in 1968, 'Galaxy' magazine carried two adverts, one signed by writers in favour and one by those against the war.&lt;ref name="luck" /&gt;{{rp|160}}&lt;ref name="vietnamads"&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=June 1968 |title=Paid Advertisement |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction |pages=4-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Caution is needed when assessing any literary movement. Science fiction writer [[Bruce Sterling]], reacting to his association with another SF movement in the 1980s, remarked:

{{quote| When did the New Wave SF end? Who was the last New Wave SF writer? You can't be a New Wave SF writer today. You can recite the numbers of them: Ballard, Ellison, Spinrad, Delaney, blah, blah, blah. What about a transitional figure like Zelazny? A literary movement isn't an army. You don't wear a uniform and swear allegiance. It's just a group of people trying to develop a sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;Myer, Thomas. [http://www.sfsite.com/09a/bru16.htm "Chatting with Bruce Sterling at LoneStarCon 2"] Retrieved 2010-10-10&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly Rob Latham observed:

{{quote|... indeed, one of the central ways the New Wave was experienced, in the US and Britain, was as a "liberated" outburst of erotic expression, often counterpoised, by advocates of the "New Thing"(as Merril called it), with the priggish Puritanism of the Golden Age. Yet this stark contrast, while not unreasonable, tends ultimately, as do most of the historical distinctions drawn between the New Wave and its predecessors, to overemphasize rupture at the expense of continuity, effectively "disappearing" some of the pioneering trends in 1950s sf that paved the way for the New Wave's innovations.&lt;ref name="latham2" /&gt;{{rp|252}}}}

Bearing this proviso in mind it is still possible to sum up the New Wave in terms of rupture as is done for example by Darren Harris-Fain of [[Shawnee State University]]:

{{quote|The split between the New Wave and everyone else in American SF during the late 1960s was nearly as dramatic as the division at the same time between young protesters and what they called "the establishment," and in fact, the political views of the younger writers, often prominent in their work, reflect many contemporary concerns. New Wave accused what became de facto the old wave of being old-fashioned, patriarchal, imperialistic, and obsessed with technology; many of the more established writers thought the New Wave shallow, said that its literary innovations were not innovations at all (which in fact, outside of SF, they were not), and accused it of betraying SF's grand view of humanity's role in the universe. Both assertions were largely exaggerations, of course, and in the next decade both trends would merge into a synthesis of styles and concerns. However, in 1970 the issue was far from settled and would remain a source of contention for the next few years.&lt;ref name="harfain" /&gt;{{rp|13–14}}}}

{{quote| In the August 1970 issue of the SFWA Forum, a publication circulated to members of the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]], Harlan Ellison remarked that the controversy over the New Wave, which had consumed the field during the late 1960s, seemed to have been "blissfully laid to rest." There never was, he claimed,

{{quote| any real conflict among the writers. It was all a manufactured controversy, staged by fans to hype their own participation in the genre. Their total misunderstanding of what was happening (not unusual for fans, as history … shows us) managed to stir up a great deal of pointless animosity and if it had any real effect I suspect it was in the unfortunate area of causing certain writers to feel they were unable to keep up and consequently they slowed their writing output.&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, Harlan. 'Letter to the Editor' ''SFWA Forum 15'' (August 1970): 27–28. Quoted in Latham, Rob. 'New Worlds and the New Wave in Fandom: Fan Culture and the Reshaping of Science Fiction in the Sixties' in ''Extrapolation''. (Kent State Univ., Kent, OH) (47:2) [Summer 2006], pp.296–315&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

Latham remarks that this analysis by Harlan Ellison "obscures Ellison's own prominent role – and that of other professional authors and editors such as Judith Merril, Michael Moorcock, Lester Del Rey, Frederik Pohl, and Donald A. Wollheim – in fomenting the conflict, …"

&lt;ref name="latham3" /&gt;{{rp|296}}

In the early 1970s a number of writers and readers pointed out that

{{quote| winners of the [[Nebula Award]]s, created by the Science Fiction Writers of America (SWFA) in 1965, tended to be very different from recipients of the [[Hugo Award]]s, given by fans at the annual [[World Science Fiction Convention]] (the Worldcon), arguing that this highlighted the fact that many writers had departed from readers' tastes into self-indulgence.  …

While some writers and fans continued to argue about the New Wave until the end of the 1970s – in ''The World of Science Fiction, 1926–1976: The History of a Subculture'', for instance, Lester Del Ray devotes several pages to castigating the movement – for the most part the controversy died down as the decade wore on.&lt;ref name="harfain" /&gt;{{rp|20}}}}

The closing of New Worlds magazine in 1970 "marked the containment of New Wave experiment with the rest of the counter-culture. The various limping manifestations of New World across the 1970s … demonstrated the posthumous nature of its avant-gardism.&lt;ref name="luck" /&gt;{{rp|168}}

In an essay ''The Alien Encounter'' Professor [[Patrick Parrinder]] stated that "any meaningful act of defamiliarization can only be relative, since it is not possible for man to imagine what is utterly alien to him; the utterly alien would also be meaningless."&lt;ref name="parrinder"&gt;Parrinder, Patrick. 'The Alien Encounter: Or, Ms Brown and Mrs Le Guin' in ''Science Fiction Studies'', Vol. 6, No. 1 (Mar., 1979), pp. 46–58&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48}} He continues later:

{{quote| Within SF, however, it is not necessary to break with the wider conventions of prose narrative in order to produce work that is validly experimental. The "New Wave" writing of the 1960s, with its fragmented and surrealistic forms, has not made a lasting impact, because it cast its net too wide. To reform SF one must challenge the conventions of the genre on their own terms.&lt;ref name="parrinder" /&gt;{{rp|55–56}}}}

Veteran science fiction writer [[Jack Williamson]] (1908–2006) when asked in 1991: "Did the [New] Wave's emphasis on experimentalizm and its conscious efforts to make SF more 'literary' have any kind of permanent effects on the field?" replied:

{{quote| After it subsided -- it's old hat now -- it probably left us with a sharpened awareness of language and a keener interest in literary experiment. It did wash up occasional bits of beauty and power. For example, it helped launch the careers of such writers as [Samuel R] Chip Delany, Brian Aldiss, and Harlan Ellison, all of whom seem to have gone on their own highly individualistic directions. But the key point here is that New Wave SF failed to move people. I'm not sure if this failure was due to its pessimistic themes or to people feeling the stuff was too pretentious. But it never really [[Sense of wonder|grabbed hold of people's imaginations]].&lt;ref&gt;Larry McCaffery and Jack Williamson. 'An Interview with Jack Williamson' in ''Science Fiction Studies'', Vol. 18, No. 2 (Jul., 1991), pp. 230–252: page 234&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It has been observed that

{{quote| there is something efficacious in sf's marginality and always tenuous self-identity -- its ambiguous generic distinction from other literary categories -- and, perhaps more importantly, in its distinction from what has variously been called realist, mainstream, or mundane fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Elizabeth. 'Generic Exhaustion and the "Heat Death" of Science Fiction' in ''Science Fiction Studies'', Vol. 21, No. 3 (Nov., 1994), pp. 289–301&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|289}}}}

Hartwell maintained that after the New Wave, science fiction had still managed to retain this "marginality and tenuous self-identity":

{{quote| The British and American New Wave in common would have denied the genre status of SF entirely and ended the continual development of new specialized words and phrases common to the body of SF, without which SF would be indistinguishable from mundane fiction in its entirety (rather than only out on the borders of experimental SF, which is properly indistinguishable from any other experimental literature). The denial of special or genre status is ultimately the cause of the failure of the New Wave to achieve popularity, which, if it had become truly dominant, would have destroyed SF as a separate field.&lt;ref name="hart1" /&gt;{{rp|153}}}}

Scientific accuracy was more important than literary style to Campbell, and top ''Astounding'' contributors Asimov, Heinlein, and [[L. Sprague de Camp]] were trained scientists and engineers.&lt;ref name="latham2009"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Routledge Companion to Science Fiction |last=Latham |first=Rob |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |isbn=9781135228361 |editor-last=Bould |editor-first=Mark |pages=80-89 |chapter=Fiction, 1950-1963 |editor-last2=Butler |editor-first2=Andrew M. |editor-last3=Roberts |editor-first3=Adam |editor-last4=Vint |editor-first4=Sherryl |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y7CNAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;ots=QpsnWwPrOs&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov said in 1967 "I hope that when the New Wave has deposited its froth and receded, the vast and solid shore of ''science'' fiction will appear once more".&lt;ref name="asimov196708"&gt;{{Cite magazine

The History of Science Fiction'' (London: Paladin Grafton, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|388}} Asimov himself was to illustrate just how that "SF shore" did indeed re-emerged, vast, solid—but changed. A biographer noted that during the 1960s

{{quote| stories and novels that Asimov must not have liked and must have felt were not part of the science fiction he had helped to shape were winning acclaim and awards. He also must have felt that science fiction no longer needed him. His science fiction writing, … became even more desultory and casual.

Asimov's return to serious writing in 1971 with ''The Gods Themselves'' (when much of the debate about the New Wave had dissipated) was an act of courage …&lt;ref&gt;Gunn, James. ''Isaac Asimov. The Foundation of Science Fiction'' (Oxford University Press, 1982&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|105}}}}

Darren Harris-Fain observed on this return to writing SF by Asimov that

{{quote|the novel [''The Gods Themselves''] is noteworthy for how it both shows that Asimov was indeed the same writer in the 1970s that he had been in the 1950s and that he nonetheless had been affected by the New Wave even if he was never part of it. His depiction of an alien ménage a trois, complete with homoerotic scenes between the two males, marks an interesting departure from his earlier fiction, in which sex of any sort is conspicuously absent. Also there is some minor experimentation with structure.&lt;ref name="harfain" /&gt;{{rp|43}}}}

Other themes dealt with in the novel are concerns for the environment and "human stupidity and the delusional belief in human superiority", both frequent topics in New Wave SF.&lt;ref name="harfain"&gt;Darren Harris-Fain. ''Understanding Contemporary American Science Fiction. The Age of Maturity, 1970–2000'' (University of South Carolina, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}}

Commenting in 2002 on the publication of the 35th Anniversary edition of the ''Dangerous Visions'' anthology edited by Harlan Ellison, the critic Greg L. Johnson remarked that

{{quote|if the New Wave did not entirely revolutionize the way SF was written, (the exploration of an invented world through the use of an adventure plot remains the prototypical SF story outline), they did succeed in pushing the boundaries of what could be considered SF, and their use of stylistic innovations from outside SF helped raise standards. It became less easy for writers to get away with stock characters spouting wooden dialogue laced with technical jargon. Such stories still exist, and are still published, but are no longer typical of the field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfsite.com/03b/dv148.htm ''Dangerous Visions, 35th Anniversary Edition''] Retrieved 2010-10-16&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Asimov agreed that "on the whole, the New Wave was a good thing".&lt;ref name="asimov"&gt;Asimov, Isaac. ''Asimov on Science Fiction'' (London: Granada, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|137}} He described several "interesting side effects" of the New Wave. Non-American SF became more prominent and the genre became international phenomenon. Other changes noted were that

{{quote|the New Wave encouraged more and more women to begin reading and writing science fiction…. The broadening of science fiction meant that it was approaching the 'mainstream' … in style and content. It also meant that increasing numbers of mainstream novelists were recognizing the importance of changing technology and the popularity of science fiction, and were incorporating science fiction motifs into their own novels.&lt;ref name="asimov" /&gt;{{rp|138–139}}}}

The noted academic writer on science fiction [[Edward James (historian)|Edward James]] described the New Wave and its impact as follows:

{{quote| The American New Wave was, on the whole, quite unlike the British. The latter was effectively a group of people associated with a magazine that had a particular programme …, whereas even those American writers who gathered in London at the time, like [Samuel R] Delaney,  [Thomas M] Disch, and [John] Sladek, were individuals pursuing their ''own'' ends, not those of Ballard or Moorcock. As a 'movement', the American New Wave was even less real than the British; it was no more than a concatenation of talent flourishing at the same time and bringing new ideas and new standards to the writing of sf. The British New Wave had few lasting effects, even in Britain; the American New Wave ushered in a great expansion of the field and of its readership. No doubt the writers did not achieve this success on their own. It may be noted, for instance, that this burst of originality occurred at almost exactly the same times as the three seasons of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', which certainly contributed to the expansion of sf's readership. Whether or not much of this boom can be attributed to the American New Wave, it is clear that the rise in literary and imaginative standards associated with the late 1960s contributed a great deal to some of the most original writers of the 1970s, including [[John Crowley]], [[Joe Haldeman]], [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], [[James Tiptree, Jr.]], and [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]].&lt;ref name="james" /&gt;{{rp|176}}}}

The '''Njuup''' tradition is a conservative [[Serer people|Serer]] style of [[Music genre|music]] rooted in the [[Ndut initiation rite]] (a [[rite of passage]] that young Serers must go through once in their lifetime as commanded by the [[Serer religion]]).&lt;ref name="Culture"&gt;{{en icon}} The Culture trip : [http://explore.theculturetrip.com/africa/africa-discussions/youssou-n-dour-an-unlikely-politician/  "Youssou N'Dour: An Unlikely Politician"] (Retrieved : 28 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main article|Ndut initiation rite}}
The history of Njuup derives from the [[Ndut initiation rite|Ndut classical teachings]].&lt;ref name="Culture"/&gt; Young Serer boys in the ''Ndut'' ([[nest]]) were required to compose religious songs during their [[circumcision]] rite of passage in order to take their minds off the pending circumcision operation, develop their artistic skills and spirituality. These songs are [[Serer religion|Serer religious]] in nature.&lt;ref name="Gav"/&gt; The Njuup tradition is the [[progenitor]] of [[Mbalax]] and for a long part of its history has remained within the confines of the ''Ndut''.  Unlike the ''Mbalax'' which is a [[Dance music|party music]], the Njuup tradition is religious, and it was not until some prominent [[Senegal]]ese artists such [[Youssou N'Dour]] (himself of [[Serer people|Serer heritage]]) began to incorporate it in their early works thereby giving birth to the ''Mbalax'' music.&lt;ref name="Culture"/&gt; All Mbalax artists are strongly influenced by the Njuup tradition. There are also other [[Senegambia]]n artists who sing the purest form of Njuup in the [[Serer language]], some of these include [[Rémi Jegaan Dioh]],&lt;ref name="Ferloo"&gt;{{fr icon}} Ferloo [http://www.ferloo.com/Remi-Jegaan-Dioh-Sur-un-air.html "Rémi Jegaan Dioh : Sur un air culturel et cultuel "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513074200/http://www.ferloo.com/Remi-Jegaan-Dioh-Sur-un-air.html |date=2012-05-13 }} (Retrieved : 28 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} All Africa [http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/201002251041.html "Sénégal: Rémi Diégane Dioh présente samedi son CD dédié à Senghor"]&lt;/ref&gt; the late Serer diva - [[Yandé Codou Sène]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} All Africa [http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/201112220375.html "Sénégal: Commémoration du dixième anniversaire du décès de Senghor - Les héritiers de Yandé Codou Sène et de Julien Jouga assurent les partitions"]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Serer religion|Pangool|Mbalax}}
The [[Serer religion]] especially the veneration of certain Serer [[Pangool]] influenced the religious songs sang in the [[Ndut initiation rite|Ndut]]&lt;ref name="Gav"&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]]  [http://www.refer.sn/ethiopiques/article.php3?id_article=895&amp;artsuite=6 Le Ndut dans « L'héritage spirituel sereer : valuer traditionnelle d'hier, d'aujourd'hui et de demain »] [in] ''Éthiopiques'' n° 31&lt;/ref&gt;  such as the Njuup, which in turn influenced the [[Mbalax]] and [[:Category:Senegalese singers|Senegalese artists]] who specializes in Mbalax i.e. [[Mbaye Dieye Faye]], [[Youssou N'Dour]], [[Thione Seck]], etc.&lt;ref name="Ferloo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Culture"/&gt;

'''''Panciatichi Assumption''''' (Italian: ''Assunta Panciatichi'') is a painting by Italian Renaissance artist [[Andrea del Sarto]], painted c. 1522-1523. It is housed in the [[Galleria Palatina]] of [[Palazzo Pitti]], [[Florence]], [[Italy]].

==History==
The painting was commissioned by Bartolomeo Panciatichi (the Elder) for a private altar in the French church of [[Notre-Dame-de-Confort]], in [[Lyon]]; however, when finished, it remained in Italy. It was subsequently acquired by [[Bartolomeo Panciatichi]] the Younger, the man later portrayed by [[Agnolo Bronzino]]. In 1526 Andrea del Sarto used the same composition in the ''[[Passerini Assumption]]'', now housed in the same museum. Later, Bartolomeo gifted the work to [[Jacopo Salviati]], who moved it to his [[villa del Poggio Imperiale]]. After all Salviati's possessions were confiscated by Duke [[Cosimo I de' Medici]], the villa and all its content went to [[Paolo Giordano I Orsini|Paolo Giordano Orsini]], husband of the duke's daughter [[Isabella d'Este]].

After several changes of property, including a period under the [[Odescalchi]], the villa returned to the [[House of Medici|Medici family]] in 1602. In 1687 it was decided to the move the ''Assumption'' to [[Pitti Palace]], as part of the collection of prince [[Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany|Ferdinando de' Medici]]. The panel was enlarged in that occasion, in order to mount the same frame of the ''[[Passerini Assumption]]'', also taken to the palace.

==Description==
The work depicts the theme of the [[Assumption of Mary]] with two  registers: the lower one shows the apostles of Jesus crowding around [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]'s empty sepulcher, looking at her while she ascends to heaven in a cloud in the upper part, surrounded by happy [[putto]]es. Andrea del Sarto painted two kneeling apostles in the middle, according to the traditional pyramidal composition of [[holy Conversation]]s, joining them to a circle of other apostles which can be seen, for example, in [[Raphael]]'s [[Oddi Altarpiece]].

The presence of a grotto at the right is unusual. Mary is looking upwards, surrounded by a celestial light . At her sides are two symmetrical groups of angels, whose tables perhaps were intended to contain the artist's signature, the donor's name and the execution year; another, in the middle, calls the apostles' attention towards Mary.

Some of the characters were perhaps portraits of existing people. The apostle kneeling and looking towards the seer, for example, is sometimes identified as Andrea del Sarto's self-portrait.

[[File:Paintings from the Chauvet cave (museum replica).jpg|right|thumb|Paintings in the [[Chauvet Cave]]]]
[[Image:StMaryStonePainting.jpg|thumb|200px|A painting of the [[Virgin Mary]] in the [[List of alluvial sites in Switzerland|Calnegia]] valley in the [[Swiss Alps]]. Unlike most parietal art, this painting is modern.]]
'''Parietal art''' is the archaeological term for artwork done on [[cave]] walls or large blocks of stone.  One of the most famous examples of parietal art is the [[Grotte Chauvet]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thurman |first=Judith |title=Letter from southern France: First Impressions: What were the earliest painters thinking? |newspaper=New Yorker |date=23 June 2008 |page=58ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also called "cave art", it refers to [[cave painting]]s, drawings, etchings, carvings, and pecked artwork on the interior of rock shelters and caves. The purpose of these remains of the [[Paleolithic]] and other periods of [[prehistoric art]] is not known. However, some theories suggest that these paintings were not solely for decoration as many of them were located in parts of caves that were not easily accessed.

== Age ==

Over 300 caves have been discovered in Spain and France that house parietal art from prehistoric times. Spectacular decorated caves have  also been found in Africa (e.g. [[Namibia]]), Argentina, India, China, Australia and other locations. Cave art was discovered in the 19th century, long before absolute dating was possible, and the antiquity of the art was much debated. Some scholars at the time developed a typology that was overthrown when AMS radiocarbon dating became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hirst |first=K. Kris |title=Cave Art |publisher=about.com |accessdate=26 July 2013 |url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/cterms/g/caveart.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations ==

Initial interpretations of the art at Lascaux and in other related grottoes suggested that the paintings and engravings were decorative, or just art for art’s sake. Further analysis at the tail-end of the 20th century suggested that the cave art had deep links to prehistoric rituals promoting fertility and successful hunting. Recent studies have found a systematic sequencing in the renditions of horses, aurochs (an extinct ancestor of domestic cattle), and stags,which corresponds to seasonal characteristics of each species representing Spring, Summer, and Autumn respectively.&lt;ref name="capelo" /&gt;

== Famous Upper Paleolithic sites containing parietal artwork ==

*[[Chauvet Cave]], Vallon-Pont-d'Arc, France — Discovered in 1994 and dating from 30,000 BCE, Chauvet cave comprises two main parts. In the first, most pictures are red, while in the second, the animals are mostly black. The most spectacular images are the Horse Panel and the Panel of Lions and Rhinoceroses.
* [[Caves of Arcy-sur-Cure]], [[Arcy-sur-Cure]], Burgundy, France — Known of old for the cave itself, its parietal art has only been discovered in 1990. It is the second oldest after that of the Chauvet cave, dating from 28,000 BCE.
*[[Cosquer Cave]], near Marseille, France — Discovered by the deep-sea diver Henri Cosquer in 1985, and dating from 25,000 BCE, the entrance to Cosquer cave is more than 100 feet below sea level. It contains [[hand stencils]], charcoal drawings and about 100 polychrome paintings of horses and other animals.
*[[Pech Merle]] Cave, Cabrerets, Midi-Pyrénées, France — Discovered in 1922, and dating from 25,000 BCE, Pech-Merle is famous for its dappled horses painted in charcoal and ochre on limestone. For details and photos, please see: Pech-Merle Cave Paintings.
*[[Lascaux]] Cave, Montignac, Dordogne, France — Discovered in 1940 and dating from 17,000 BCE, Lascaux contains seven decorated chambers with over 2000 painted images, including the extraordinary Hall of the Bulls which, despite its name, features mostly horses as well as the male aurochs (wild cattle) from which its name derives.

More generally, the somewhat later [[rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin]] covers over 700 caves and rock shelters with mostly painted art in a rather different style, with far more human figures.

After its discovery, Lascaux quickly became a major tourist attraction. Its caretakers realized that the equilibrium in the cave’s climate, which had kept the images intact for tens of thousands of years, was being disrupted by so many people visiting the cave, and it was closed in 1963. Around 2000, the cave became filled with a fungus that many blamed on air conditioning, the use of high-powered lights, and too many visitors. The fungus had to be painstakingly removed by hand; currently only a few scientific experts are allowed to work inside the cave, and just for a few days a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jack |first=Malcolm |title=Preserving Rock Art |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307091857/http://heritage-key.com/world/preserving-rock-art |archivedate=7 March 2012| publisher=Heritage Key |date=22 May 2009 |url=http://heritage-key.com/world/preserving-rock-art |accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most representative bacterium (''[[Pseudonocardia]]'' sp.) and fungus (''[[Fusarium]]'' sp.) from the microbial communities of a cave containing paleolithic paintings were isolated and their growth on natural substrates assessed.

Results showed that the assayed bacterium on natural substrate was able to develop best at in situ temperature and that the addition of organic nutrients and/or phosphate enhanced its growth. The growth of the assayed fungus, however, was limited by low temperature and the availability of ammonium. These results confirm a differential behavior of microorganisms between the laboratory and the natural environments and could explain previous invasion of fungi reported for some caves with prehistoric paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stomeo | first1 = F. | last2 = Portillo | first2 = M.

The '''''Pastoral Concert''''', ''Fête champêtre'' or ''Le Concert champêtre'' is an [[oil painting]] of c. 1509 attributed to either of the Italian Renaissance masters, [[Titian]] (more usually today) or [[Giorgione]]. It is in the [[Musée du Louvre]] in Paris.

==History==
The painting was originally attributed to Giorgione, but modern critics assign it more likely to the slightly younger Titian, as the figures' robustness is thought more typical of his style.&lt;ref name=Fregolent&gt;{{cite book|first=Alessandra |last=Fregolent|title=Giorgione|publisher=Electa|location=Milan|page=111|year=2001|isbn=88-8310-184-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that Giorgione (whose works included elements such as music, pastoral subjects and the simultaneous representation of the visible and invisible) began the work, and then, after his death in 1510, it was finished  by Titian.&lt;ref name=Fregolent/&gt;

The work was owned by the [[house of Gonzaga|Gonzaga family]], perhaps inherited from [[Isabella d'Este]]: it was later sold to [[Charles I of England]]. When the English royal collections were dispersed following,the revolution of 1649, the painting was sold at auction to the German banker and art collector, [[Eberhard Jabach]], who, in turn, sold it to [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in 1671.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le concert champêtre|url=http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=22879&amp;langue=fr|work=Louvre Museum website|accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The painting was also attributed to [[Palma the Elder]] and [[Sebastiano del Piombo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=93|first=Francesco |last=Valcanover|title= L'opera completa di Tiziano |publisher=Rizzoli|location=Milan |year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Édouard Manet]] conceived his ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' (1863) after viewing the ''Pastoral Concert'' in a visit to the Louvre museum.&lt;ref name ="Zuffi"&gt;{{cite book|first=Stefano |page=32|last=Zuffi|title=Tiziano|publisher=Mondadori Arte|location=Milan|year= 2008|isbn= 978-88-370-6436-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The painting portrays three young people on a lawn, playing music together, while next to them a standing woman is pouring water from a marble basin. Both the women are naked apart from drapes that have fallen to their legs; the two men are dressed in contemporary costume. In the wide background is a shepherd and a landscape.

The subject was perhaps the allegory of poetry and music: the two women would be an imaginary apparition representing the ideal beauty, stemming from the two men's fantasy and inspiration. The woman with the glass vase would be the muse of tragic poetry, while the other one would be that of the pastoral poetry. Of the two playing men, the one with the lute would represent the exalted lyric poetry, the other being an ordinary lyricist, according to the distinction made by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.  Another interpretation suggests that the painting is an evocation of the four elements of the natural world (water, fire, earth and air) and their harmonic relationship.&lt;ref name="Zuffi"/&gt;

'''Perfume''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|p|ɜːr|f|j|uː|m}}, {{IPAc-en|US|p|ər|ˈ|f|j|uː|m}}; {{lang-fr|parfum}}) is a mixture of fragrant [[essential oil]]s or [[aroma compound]]s, [[Fixative (perfumery)|fixative]]s and [[solvent]]s, used to give the human body, animals, food, objects, and living-spaces an agreeable [[scent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/perfume|title= Perfume – Definition and More from Dictionary|work= merriam-webster.com}}wtf
&lt;/ref&gt;
It is usually in liquid form and used to give a pleasant scent to a person's body.
Ancient texts and archaeological excavations show the use of perfumes in some of the earliest human civilizations. Modern perfumery began in the late 19th century with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds such as [[vanillin]] or [[coumarin]], which allowed for the composition of perfumes with smells previously unattainable solely from natural aromatics alone.

==History==
{{main|History of perfume}}

[[File:Egypte louvre 021.jpg|thumbnail|left|Egyptian scene depicting the preparation of lily perfume, 4th century BC]]

The word ''perfume'' derives from the Latin ''perfumare'', meaning "to smoke through". Perfumery, as the art of making perfumes, began in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], and was further refined by the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] and the Arabs.

The world's first-recorded [[chemist]] is considered a woman named [[Tapputi]], a perfume maker mentioned in a [[cuneiform]] tablet from the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Strathern, Paul |title= Mendeleyev's Dream – The Quest For the Elements|location= New York | publisher= Berkley Books|year= 2000|isbn= 0-425-18467-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; She distilled flowers, oil, and [[Acorus calamus|calamus]] with other [[aromatic]]s, then filtered and put them back in the still several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Levey|first=Martin|title= Early Arabic Pharmacology: An Introduction Based on Ancient and Medieval Sources|publisher= Brill Archive|year=1973|page= 9|isbn= 90-04-03796-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, perfume and perfumery existed in the [[Indus civilization]] (3300 BC – 1300 BC). One of the earliest distillations of [[Ittar]] was mentioned in the Hindu Ayurvedic text ''[[Charaka Samhita]]'' and ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Agriculture Diversification: Problems and Perspectives|author1= A.K.

In the 9th century the [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Arab chemist]] [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus) wrote the ''Book of the Chemistry of Perfume and Distillations'', which contained more than a hundred recipes for fragrant [[oils]], salves, aromatic waters, and substitutes or imitations of costly drugs.

[[File:Arheologicheski-Perfume.jpg|thumb|A Byzantine [[alembic]] used to distil perfumes.]]

The Persian chemist Ibn Sina (also known as [[Avicenna]]) introduced the process of extracting oils from flowers by means of [[distillation]], the procedure most commonly used today. He first experimented with the [[rose]]. Until his discovery, liquid perfumes consisted of mixtures of oil and crushed herbs or petals, which made a strong blend. [[Rose water]] was more delicate, and immediately became popular. Both the raw ingredients and the distillation technology significantly influenced western perfumery and scientific developments, particularly [[chemistry]].

The art of perfumery was known in western Europe from 1221, taking into account the [[monk]]s' recipes of Santa Maria delle Vigne or [[Santa Maria Novella]] of [[Florence]], Italy.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} In the east, the [[Hungarians]] produced in 1370 a perfume made of scented oils blended in an alcohol solution – best known as [[Hungary Water]] – at the behest of [[Elisabeth of Poland|Queen Elizabeth of Hungary]]. The art of perfumery prospered in [[Renaissance]] Italy, and in the 16th century the personal perfumer to [[Catherine de' Medici]] (1519–1589), Rene the [[Florence|Florentine]] (Renato il fiorentino), took Italian refinements to France. His laboratory was connected with her apartments by a secret passageway, so that no formulae could be stolen en route. Thanks to Rene, France quickly became one of the European centers of perfume and [[cosmetics]] manufacture. Cultivation of flowers for their perfume essence, which had begun in the 14th century, grew into a major industry in the south of France.

Between the 16th and 17th centuries, perfumes were used primarily by the wealthy to mask [[body odor]]s resulting from infrequent bathing. Partly due to this patronage, the perfume industry developed. In 1693, Italian barber Giovanni Paolo Feminis created a perfume water called Aqua Admirabilis,&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{cite book

By the 18th century the [[Grasse]] region of France, [[Sicily]], and [[Calabria]] (in Italy) were growing aromatic plants to provide the growing perfume industry with raw materials. Even today, Italy and France remain the center of European perfume design and [[trade]].

Perfume types reflect the concentration of aromatic compounds in a solvent, which in fine fragrance is typically [[ethanol]] or a mix of water and ethanol. Various sources differ considerably in the definitions of perfume types. The intensity and longevity of a perfume is based on the concentration, intensity and longevity of the aromatic compounds, or perfume oils, used. As the percentage of aromatic compounds increases, so does the intensity and longevity of the scent. Specific terms are used to describe a fragrance's approximate concentration by the percent of perfume oil in the volume of the final product.

What makes them different — and in many cases, more expensive?}}&lt;/ref&gt; are:
* '''parfum''' or '''extrait''', in English known as perfume extract, pure perfume, or simply perfume: 15–40% aromatic compounds ([[International Fragrance Association|IFRA]]: typically ~20%);
* '''esprit de parfum''' (ESdP): 15–30% aromatic compounds, a seldom used strength concentration in between EdP and perfume;
* '''eau de parfum''' (EdP) or '''parfum de toilette''' (PdT) (The strength usually sold as "perfume"&lt;ref name="NYT71218"/&gt;): 10–20% aromatic compounds (typically ~15%); sometimes called "eau de perfume" or "millésime"; parfum de toilette is a less common term, most popular in the 1980s, that is generally analogous to eau de parfum;
* '''[[eau de toilette]]''' (EdT): 5–15% aromatic compounds (typically ~10%);
* '''[[eau de Cologne]]''' (EdC): often simply called cologne: 3–8% aromatic compounds (typically ~5%); see below for more information on the confusing nature of the term "cologne";
* '''eau fraiche''': products sold as "splashes", "mists", "veils" and other imprecise terms. Generally these products contain 3% or less aromatic compounds and are diluted with water rather than oil or alcohol.&lt;ref name="NYT71218"/&gt;

There is much confusion over the term "cologne", which has three meanings. The first and oldest definition refers to a family of fresh, citrus-based fragrances distilled using extracts from citrus, floral, and woody ingredients. Supposedly these were first developed in the early 18th century in [[Cologne, Germany]], hence the name. This type of "classical cologne" describes unisex compositions "which are basically citrus blends and do not have a perfume parent."&lt;ref name="Glossary C"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary (C) |url=http://www.fragrance.org/glossary.php?l=C |publisher=The Fragrance Foundation |accessdate=7 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731203552/http://www.fragrance.org/glossary.php?l=C |archivedate=31 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include Mäurer &amp; Wirtz's ''[[4711]]'' (created in 1799), and Guerlain's ''Eau de Cologne Impériale'' (1853).

In the 20th century, the term took on a second meaning. Fragrance companies began to offer lighter, less concentrated interpretations of their existing perfumes, making their products available to a wider range of customers. Guerlain, for example, offered an Eau de Cologne version of its flagship perfume ''[[Shalimar (perfume)|Shalimar]]''. In contrast to classical colognes, this type of modern cologne is a lighter, diluted, less concentrated interpretation of a more concentrated product, typically a pure parfum. The cologne version is often the lightest concentration from a line of fragrance products.&lt;ref name="Glossary C"/&gt;

Finally, the term "cologne" has entered the English language as a generic, overarching term to denote a fragrance worn by a man, regardless of its concentration. The actual product worn by a man may technically be an eau de toilette, but he may still say that he "wears cologne". A similar problem surrounds the term "perfume", which can be used a generic sense to refer to fragrances marketed to women, whether or not the fragrance is actually an extrait.

Classical colognes first appeared in Europe in the 17th century. The first fragrance labeled a "parfum" extract with a high concentration of aromatic compounds was Guerlain's ''[[Jicky]]'' in 1889. Eau de Toilette appeared alongside parfum around the turn of the century. The EdP concentration and terminology is the most recent. Parfum de toilette and EdP began to appear in the 1970s and gained popularity in the 1980s.

[[File:J.B. Filz Vienna 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|J.B. Filz in Vienna. Perfumeries with long traditions, such as J.B. Filz, created their own scents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wien.info/en/lifestyle-scene/trendy/scents-from-vienna|title=Scents from Vienna|work=wien.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The wide range in the percentages of aromatic compounds that may be present in each concentration means that the terminology of extrait, EdP, EdT, and EdC is quite imprecise. Although an EdP will often be more concentrated than an EdT and in turn an EdC, this is not always the case. Different perfumeries or perfume houses assign different amounts of oils to each of their perfumes. Therefore, although the oil concentration of a perfume in EdP dilution will necessarily be higher than the same perfume in EdT from within a company's same range, the actual amounts vary among perfume houses. An EdT from one house may have a higher concentration of aromatic compounds than an EdP from another.

Furthermore, some fragrances with the same ''product name'' but having a different ''concentration'' may not only differ in their dilutions, but actually use different perfume oil mixtures altogether. For instance, in order to make the EdT version of a fragrance brighter and fresher than its EdP, the EdT oil may be "tweaked" to contain slightly more top notes or fewer base notes. ''[[Chanel No. 5]]'' is a good example: its parfum, EdP, EdT, and now-discontinued EdC concentrations are in fact different compositions (the parfum dates to 1921, whereas the EdP was not developed until the 1980s). In some cases, words such as ''extrême'', ''intense'', or ''concentrée'' that might indicate a higher aromatic concentration are actually completely different fragrances, related only because of a similar perfume ''accord''. An example of this is Chanel's ''Pour Monsieur'' and ''Pour Monsieur Concentrée''.

As a rule of thumb, women's fragrances tend to have higher levels of aromatic compounds than men's fragrances. Fragrances marketed to men are typically sold as EdT or EdC, rarely as EdP or perfume extracts. Women's fragrances used to be common in all levels of concentration, but today are mainly seen in parfum, EdP and EdT concentrations.

===Solvent types===
Perfume oils are often diluted with a solvent, though this is not always the case, and its necessity is disputed. By far the most common solvent for perfume is oil dilution is an alcohol solution, typically a mixture of ethanol and water or a [[rectified spirit]]. Perfume oil can also be diluted by means of neutral-smelling oils such as fractionated [[coconut oil]], or liquid [[wax]]es such as [[jojoba oil]].

===Applying fragrances===
The conventional application of pure perfume (parfum extrait) in Western cultures is at pulse points, such as behind the ears, the nape of the neck, and the insides of wrists, elbows and knees, so that the pulse point will warm the perfume and release fragrance continuously. According to perfumer [[Sophia Grojsman]] behind the knees is the ideal point to apply perfume in order that the scent may rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://forward.com/news/144873/perfume-nose-conjures-up-perfect-scents/ | title=Perfume 'Nose' Conjures Up Perfect Scents | publisher=forward.com | accessdate=8 August 2015 | author=Berger, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern perfume industry encourages the practice of layering fragrance so that it is released in different intensities depending upon the time of the day. Lightly scented products such as bath oil, shower gel, and body lotion are recommended for the morning; eau de toilette is suggested for the afternoon; and perfume applied to the pulse points for evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Agata A. Listowska, MA  |author2=Mark A.

==Describing a perfume==
[[File:Fougère Royale by Paul Parquet - Bottle.jpg|thumb|upright|An original bottle of ''Fougère Royale'' by [[Houbigant Parfum|Houbigant]]. Created by [[Paul Parquet]] in 1884, it is one of the most important modern perfumes and inspired the eponymous [[Fougère]] class of fragrances.]]

[[File:Fragrance pyramid.svg|thumb|upright|Fragrance pyramid]]

The precise formulae of commercial perfumes are kept [[Trade secret|secret]]. Even if they were widely published, they would be dominated by such complex ingredients and odorants that they would be of little use in providing a guide to the general consumer in description of the ''experience'' of a scent. Nonetheless, connoisseurs of perfume can become extremely skillful at identifying components and origins of scents in the same manner as wine experts.&lt;ref name=Burr&gt;{{cite book | author=Burr, Chandler | title=The Emperor of Scent: A Story of Perfume, Obsession, and the Last Mystery of the Senses | year=2003 | location=New York | publisher=Random House | isbn=0-375-50797-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most practical way to start describing a perfume is according to the elements of the ''fragrance notes'' of the scent or the "family" it belongs to, all of which affect the overall impression of a perfume from first application to the last lingering hint of scent.&lt;ref name=Fortineau&gt;Perfume connoisseurs speak of a fragrance's "sillage", or the discernible trail it leaves in the air when applied. Fortineau, Anne-Dominique (2004). "Chemistry Perfumes Your Daily Life". ''Journal of Chemical Education''.81(1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Edwards1&gt;Edwards, Michael (2006). "Fragrances of the World 2006". ''Crescent House Publishing''. {{ISBN|0-9756097-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trail of scent left behind by a person wearing perfume is called its ''sillage'', after the French word for "[[wake]]", as in the trail left by a boat in water.

===Fragrance notes===
{{main| Note (perfumery)}}

Perfume is described in a musical metaphor as having three sets of ''notes'', making the harmonious scent ''accord''. The notes unfold over time, with the immediate impression of the top note leading to the deeper middle notes, and the base notes gradually appearing as the final stage. These notes are created carefully with knowledge of the evaporation process of the perfume.
*'''Top notes''': Also called the '''''head notes'''''. The scents that are perceived immediately on application of a perfume. Top notes consist of small, light molecules that evaporate quickly. They form a person's initial impression of a perfume and thus are very important in the selling of a perfume. Examples of top notes include mint, lavender and coriander.
*'''Middle notes''': Also referred to as '''''heart notes'''''. The scent of a perfume that emerges just prior to the dissipation of the top note. The middle note compounds form the "''heart''" or main body of a perfume and act to mask the often unpleasant initial impression of base notes, which become more pleasant with time. Examples of middle notes include seawater, sandalwood and jasmine.
*'''Base notes''': The scent of a perfume that appears close to the departure of the middle notes. The base and middle notes together are the main theme of a perfume. Base notes bring depth and solidity to a perfume. Compounds of this class of scents are typically rich and "deep" and are usually not perceived until 30 minutes after application. Examples of base notes include tobacco, amber and musk.
The scents in the top and middle notes are influenced by the base notes; conversely, the scents of the base notes will be altered by the types of fragrance materials used as middle notes. Manufacturers who publish perfume notes typically do so with the fragrance components presented as a ''fragrance pyramid''&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.lebermuth.com/fragrance-101-understanding-the-fragrance-pyramid Fragrance 101 Understanding The Fragrance Pyramid]&lt;/ref&gt;, using imaginative and abstract terms for the components listed.

===Olfactive families===
Grouping perfumes can never be a completely objective or final process. Many fragrances contain aspects of different families. Even a perfume designated as "single flower", however subtle, will have undertones of other aromatics. "True" unitary scents can rarely be found in perfumes as it requires the perfume to exist only as a singular aromatic material.

Classification by olfactive family is a starting point for a description of a perfume, but it cannot by itself denote the specific characteristic of that perfume.

====Traditional====

[[File:Opium by YSL.jpg|thumb|upright|Opium by YSL, of amber or oriental fragrance class]]
[[File:Joy Jean Patou.jpg|thumb|upright|A floral bouquet, Joy from [[Jean Patou]]]]
The traditional classification which emerged around 1900 comprised the following categories:
*'''Single Floral''': Fragrances that are dominated by a scent from one particular flower; in French called a ''soliflore''. (e.g. [[Serge Lutens]]' ''Sa Majeste La Rose'', which is dominated by rose.)
*'''Floral Bouquet''': Is a combination of fragrance of several flowers in a perfume compound. Examples include ''Quelques Fleurs'' by [[Houbigant (perfume)|Houbigant]] and ''[[Joy (perfume)|Joy]]'' by [[Jean Patou]].
*'''Amber or "Oriental"''': A large fragrance class featuring the sweet slightly animalic scents of [[ambergris]] or [[labdanum]], often combined with [[vanilla]], [[tonka bean]], flowers and woods. Can be enhanced by camphorous oils and [[incense]] resins, which bring to mind [[Victorian era]] imagery of the Middle East and [[Far East]]. Traditional examples include [[Guerlain]]'s ''[[Shalimar (perfume)|Shalimar]]'', [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]]'s ''[[Opium (perfume)|Opium]]'' and Chanel's ''Coco Mademoiselle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanel.com/en_US/fragrance-beauty/Fragrance-Coco-Mademoiselle-COCO-MADEMOISELLE-PARFUM-88207|title=Coco Mademoiselle from Chanel|publisher=www.chanel.com |accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Woody''': Fragrances that are dominated by woody scents, typically of [[agarwood]], [[sandalwood]], [[cedar wood|cedarwood]], and [[vetiver]]. Patchouli, with its [[camphor]]aceous smell, is commonly found in these perfumes. A traditional example here would be Myrurgia's ''Maderas De Oriente'' or [[Chanel]] ''Bois des Îles''. A modern example would be [[Balenciaga]] ''Rumba''.
*'''Leather''': A family of fragrances which features the scents of [[honey]], [[tobacco]], wood and wood [[tar]]s in its middle or base notes and a scent that alludes to leather. Traditional examples include [[Robert Piguet]]'s ''Bandit'' and [[Pierre Balmain|Balmain]]'s ''Jolie Madame''.
*'''[[Chypre]]''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃipʁ|IPA}}): Meaning ''[[Cyprus]]'' in French, this includes fragrances built on a similar accord consisting of [[bergamot orange|bergamot]], [[oakmoss]], and [[labdanum]]. This family of fragrances is named after the eponymous 1917 perfume by [[François Coty]], and one of the most famous extant examples is [[Guerlain]]'s ''[[Mitsouko (perfume)|Mitsouko]]''.
*'''[[Fougère]]''' ({{IPA-fr|fu.ʒɛʁ|IPA}}): Meaning ''[[fern]]'' in French, built on a base of [[lavender]], [[coumarin]] and [[oakmoss]]. [[Houbigant (perfume)|Houbigant]]'s ''Fougère Royale'' pioneered the use of this base. Many men's fragrances belong to this family of fragrances, which is characterized by its sharp herbaceous and woody scent. Some well-known modern fougères are [[Fabergé]] ''Brut'' and [[Guy Laroche]] ''Drakkar Noir''.

==== Modern ====
[[File:Perfume.ogv|thumb|Perfume being sprayed in the air.]]
Since 1945, due to great advances in the technology of perfume creation (i.e., compound design and synthesis) as well as the natural development of styles and tastes, new categories have emerged to describe modern scents:
*'''Bright Floral''': combining the traditional Single Floral &amp; Floral Bouquet categories. A good example would be [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estée Lauder]]'s ''Beautiful''.
*'''Green''': a lighter and more modern interpretation of the Chypre type, with pronounced cut grass, crushed green leaf and cucumber-like scents. Examples include Estée Lauder's ''Aliage'', Sisley's ''Eau de Campagne'', and Calvin Klein's ''Eternity''.
*'''Aquatic''', '''Oceanic''', or '''Ozonic''': the newest category in perfume history, first appearing in 1988 [[Davidoff]] ''[[Cool Water (perfume)|Cool Water]]'' (1988), Christian Dior's ''Dune'' (1991), and many others. A clean smell reminiscent of the ocean, leading to many of the modern [[androgynous]] perfumes. Generally contains [[calone]], a synthetic scent discovered in 1966, or other more recent synthetics. Also used to accent floral, oriental, and woody fragrances.
*'''Citrus''': An old fragrance family that until recently consisted mainly of "freshening" eau de colognes, due to the low tenacity of citrus scents. Development of newer fragrance compounds has allowed for the creation of primarily citrus fragrances. A good example here would be Faberge ''Brut''.
*'''Fruity''': featuring the aromas of fruits other than citrus, such as peach, cassis (black currant), mango, passion fruit, and others. A modern example here would be Ginestet ''Botrytis''.
*'''Gourmand''' ({{IPA-fr|ɡuʁmɑ̃|lang}}): scents with "edible" or "dessert"-like qualities. These often contain notes like vanilla, [[tonka bean]] and [[coumarin]], as well as synthetic components designed to resemble food flavors. A sweet example is [[Thierry Mugler]]'s ''Angel''.

====Fragrance wheel====
{{main|Fragrance wheel}}
[[File:Wheel2.gif|thumb|Fragrance Wheel perfume [[classification chart]], ver. 1983]]
The Fragrance wheel is a relatively new classification method that is widely used in retail and in the fragrance industry. The method was created in 1983 by [[Michael Edwards (fragrance expert)|Michael Edwards]], a consultant in the perfume industry, who designed his own scheme of fragrance classification. The new scheme was created in order to simplify fragrance classification and naming scheme, as well as to show the relationships between each of the individual classes.&lt;ref name="OGrantInterview"&gt;{{cite web |author= Osborne, Grant |date= 1 May 2001 |title= Interview with Michael Edwards |url= http://www.basenotes.net/interviews/int-medwards.html |accessdate= 17 December 2006 |publisher= Basenotes |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070206133603/http://www.basenotes.net/interviews/int-medwards.html |archivedate= 6 February 2007 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five standard families consist of ''Floral'', ''Oriental'', ''Woody'', ''Aromatic Fougère'', and ''Fresh'', with the first four families borrowing from the classic terminology and the last consisting of newer bright and clean smelling citrus and oceanic fragrances that have arrived in the past generation due to improvements in fragrance technology. Each of the families are in turn divided into subgroups and arranged around a wheel.
In this classification scheme, ''Chanel No.5'', which is traditionally classified as an aldehydic floral, would be located under the Soft Floral sub-group, and amber scents would be placed within the Oriental group. As a class, [[chypre]] perfumes are more difficult to place since they would be located under parts of the Oriental and Woody families. For instance, Guerlain's ''Mitsouko'' is placed under Mossy Woods, but Hermès ''Rouge'', a chypre with more floral character, would be placed under Floral Oriental.

==Aromatics sources==

===Plant sources===
[[File:Citrus x limon Blüten und Schädlinge.JPG|thumb|upright|Citrus tree blossom]]
[[File:Myrrh.JPG|thumb|Resins in perfumery include [[myrrh]]]]
[[File:Frankincense 2005-12-31.jpg|thumb|Frankincense]]

Plants have long been used in perfumery as a source of essential oils and aroma compounds. These aromatics are usually [[secondary metabolites]] produced by plants as protection against [[herbivore]]s, infections, as well as to attract [[pollinator]]s. Plants are by far the largest source of fragrant compounds used in perfumery. The sources of these compounds may be derived from various parts of a plant. A plant can offer more than one source of aromatics, for instance the aerial portions and seeds of [[coriander]] have remarkably different odors from each other. [[Orange (fruit)|Orange]] leaves, blossoms, and fruit zest are the respective sources of [[petitgrain]], [[neroli]], and [[orange oil]]s.
* '''[[Bark (botany)|Bark]]''': Commonly used barks include [[cinnamon]] and [[cascarilla]]. The fragrant oil in [[sassafras]] root bark is also used either directly or purified for its main constituent, [[safrole]], which is used in the synthesis of other fragrant compounds.
* '''[[Flower]]s''' and '''[[blossom]]s''': Undoubtedly the largest and most common source of perfume aromatics. Includes the flowers of several species of [[rose]] and [[jasmine]], as well as [[osmanthus]], [[plumeria]], [[Acacia farnesiana|mimosa]], [[tuberose]], [[Narcissus (plant)|narcissus]], [[Pelargonium graveolens|scented geranium]], [[Vachellia farnesiana|cassie]], [[ambrette]] as well as the blossoms of [[citrus]] and [[ylang-ylang]] trees. Although not traditionally thought of as a flower, the unopened flower buds of the [[clove]] are also commonly used. Most orchid flowers are not commercially used to produce essential oils or absolutes, except in the case of [[vanilla]], an orchid, which must be pollinated first and made into seed pods before use in perfumery.
* '''[[Fruit]]s''': Fresh fruits such as [[apple]]s, [[strawberry|strawberries]], [[cherry|cherries]] rarely yield the expected odors when extracted; if such fragrance notes are found in a perfume, they are more likely to be of synthetic origin. Notable exceptions include blackcurrant leaf, [[litsea|litsea cubeba]], vanilla, and [[juniper|juniper berry]]. The most commonly used fruits yield their aromatics from the rind; they include citrus such as [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[lemon]]s, and [[lime (fruit)|limes]]. Although [[grapefruit]] rind is still used for aromatics, more and more commercially used grapefruit aromatics are artificially synthesized since the natural aromatic contains [[sulfur]] and its degradation product is quite unpleasant in smell.
* '''[[Leaves]]''' and '''[[twigs]]''': Commonly used for perfumery are [[lavender]] leaf, [[patchouli]], [[Common sage|sage]], [[violet (plant)|violets]], [[rosemary]], and citrus leaves. Sometimes leaves are valued for the "green" smell they bring to perfumes, examples of this include [[hay]] and [[tomato]] leaf.
* '''[[Resin]]s''': Valued since antiquity, resins have been widely used in [[incense]] and perfumery. Highly fragrant and antiseptic resins and resin-containing perfumes have been used by many cultures as medicines for a large variety of ailments. Commonly used resins in perfumery include [[labdanum]], [[frankincense]]/[[olibanum]], [[myrrh]], [[balsam of Peru]], [[benzoin (resin)|benzoin]]. [[Pine]] and [[fir]] resins are a particularly valued source of [[terpene]]s used in the [[organic synthesis]] of many other synthetic or naturally occurring aromatic compounds. Some of what is called [[amber]] and [[copal]] in perfumery today is the resinous secretion of fossil [[conifer]]s.
*'''[[Root]]s, [[rhizome]]s and [[bulb]]s''': Commonly used terrestrial portions in perfumery include [[iris (plant)|iris]] [[rhizome]]s, [[vetiver]] roots, various rhizomes of the [[ginger]] family.
* '''[[Seed]]s''': Commonly used seeds include [[tonka bean]], [[Daucus carota|carrot seed]], [[coriander]], [[caraway]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[nutmeg]], [[mace (spice)|mace]], [[cardamom]], and [[anise]].
* '''[[Wood]]s''': Highly important in providing the base notes to a perfume, wood oils and distillates are indispensable in perfumery. Commonly used woods include [[sandalwood]], [[rosewood]], [[agarwood]], [[birch]], [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[juniper]], and [[pine]]. These are used in the form of macerations or dry-distilled (rectified) forms.
*'''Rom [[terpenes]]'''. Orchid scents

===Animal sources===
[[File:Primary Form of Musk.jpg|thumb|A [[musk]] pod. Extensive hunting of male [[musk deer]] for their pods in recent history has resulted in the detriment of the species.]]
[[File:Ambergris.jpg|thumb|[[Ambergris]]]]
*'''[[Ambergris]]''': Lumps of [[oxidize]]d fatty compounds, whose precursors were secreted and expelled by the [[sperm whale]]. Ambergris should not be confused with [[amber|yellow amber]], which is used in jewelry. Because the harvesting of ambergris involves no harm to its animal source, it remains one of the few animalic fragrancing agents around which little controversy now exists.
*'''[[Castoreum]]''': Obtained from the odorous sacs of the North American beaver.
*'''[[Civet (perfumery)|Civet]]''': Also called civet musk, this is obtained from the odorous sacs of the civets, animals in the family ''Viverridae'', related to the [[mongoose]]. [[World Animal Protection]] investigated African civets caught for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profumo.it/internet-documents/zibetto/suffering.htm|title=Civet suffering|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Hyraceum]]''': Commonly known as "Africa stone", is the petrified excrement of the [[rock hyrax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olsen |first=Andreas |author2=Linda C.

*'''[[Honeycomb]]''': From the honeycomb of the [[honeybee]]. Both beeswax and honey can be solvent extracted to produce an absolute. Beeswax is extracted with ethanol and the ethanol evaporated to produce beeswax absolute.
*'''[[Musk]]''': Originally derived from a gland (sac or pod) located between the genitals and the umbilicus of the Himalayan male [[musk deer]] Moschus moschiferus, it has now mainly been replaced by the use of [[synthetic musk]]s sometimes known as "white musk".

===Other natural sources===
* '''[[Lichen]]s''': Commonly used lichens include [[oakmoss]] and [[treemoss]] thalli.
* '''[[Brown algae|"Seaweed"]]''': Distillates are sometimes used as [[essential oil]] in perfumes. An example of a commonly used seaweed is ''[[Fucus vesiculosus]]'', which is commonly referred to as bladder wrack. Natural seaweed fragrances are rarely used due to their higher cost and lower potency than synthetics.

===Synthetic sources===
{{main| Aroma compound}}
Many modern perfumes contain [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]] odorants. Synthetics can provide fragrances which are not found in nature. For instance, [[Calone]], a compound of synthetic origin, imparts a fresh ozonous metallic marine scent that is widely used in contemporary perfumes. Synthetic aromatics are often used as an alternate source of compounds that are not easily obtained from natural sources. For example, [[linalool]] and [[coumarin]] are both naturally occurring compounds that can be inexpensively synthesized from [[terpenes]]. Orchid scents (typically ''[[salicylic acid|salicylates]]'') are usually not obtained directly from the plant itself but are instead synthetically created to match the fragrant compounds found in various orchids.

One of the most commonly used classes of synthetic aromatics by far are the [[synthetic musk|white musk]]s. These materials are found in all forms of commercial perfumes as a neutral background to the middle notes. These musks are added in large quantities to laundry detergents in order to give washed clothes a lasting "clean" scent.

The majority of the world's synthetic aromatics are created by relatively few [[:Category:Fragrance companies|companies]]. They include:
* [[International Flavors and Fragrances]] (IFF)
* [[Givaudan]]
* [[Firmenich]]
* [[Takasago International Corporation|Takasago]]
* [[Symrise]]
Each of these companies patents several processes for the production of aromatic synthetics annually.

===Characteristics===
Natural and synthetics are used for their different odor characteristics in perfumery
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!|
! style="background:#ff5656;"|Naturals
! style="background:#5656ff;"|Synthetics
|-
!|Variance
|Natural scents will vary from each supplier based on when and where they are harvested, how they are processed, and the extraction method itself. This means that a certain flower grown in Morocco and in France will smell different, even if the same method is used to grow, harvest, and extract the scent. As such, each perfumer will prefer flowers grown in one country over another, or one extraction method to the next. However, due to a natural scent's mixed composition, it is easy for unscrupulous suppliers to adulterate the actual raw materials by changing its ''source'' (adding Indian jasmine into Grasse jasmine) or the ''contents'' (adding linalool to rosewood) to increase their [[profit margin]].
|Much more consistent than natural aromatics. However, differences in organic synthesis may result in minute differences in concentration of impurities. If these impurities have low smell (detection) thresholds, the differences in the scent of the synthetic aromatic will be significant.
|-
!|Components
|Contains many different organic compounds, each adding a different note to the overall scent. Certain naturally derived substances have a long history of use, but this cannot always be used as an indicator of whether they are safe or not. Possible allergenic or carcinogenic compounds.
|Depending on purity, consists primarily of one chemical compound. Sometimes [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] mixtures of isomers, such as in the case of [[Iso E Super]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iso E Super® |publisher=International Flavors &amp; Fragrances |year=2007 |url=http://www.iff.com/Ingredients.nsf/0/E69A1213546C4F8B80256993003995C6 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223080634/http://www.iff.com/Ingredients.nsf/0/E69A1213546C4F8B80256993003995C6 |archivedate=23 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the almost pure composition of one chemical compound, the same molecules found diluted in nature will have a different scent and effect on the body, if used undiluted.
|-
!|Scent uniqueness
|Reminiscent of its originating material, although extraction may capture a different "layer" of the scent, depending on the how the extraction method denatures the odoriferous compounds.
|Similar to natural scents yet different at the same time. Some synthetics attempt to mimic natural notes, while others explore the entire spectrum of scent. Novel scent compounds not found in nature will often be unique in their scent.
|-
!|Scent complexity
|Deep and complex fragrance notes. Soft, with subtle scent nuances. Highly valued for ideal composition.
|Pure and pronounced fragrance notes. Often monotonous in nature, yet reminiscent of other natural scents.
|-
!|Price
|Dependent on extraction method. More expensive, but not always, as prices are determined by the labor and difficulty of properly extracting each unit of the natural materials, as well as its quality. Typically the relationship between, longevity of a perfume, cost and the concentration of essential oils follows the graph below:
[[File:Cologne Strength vs. Cost vs. Cologne Concentration.jpg|thumb|This chart shows the typical relationship between price of perfume, its longevity and the concentration of essential oils.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost Curve|url=http://www.topcolognesformen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|Dependent on synthesis method. Generally cheaper, but not necessarily. Synthetic aromatics are not necessarily cheaper than naturals, with some synthetics being more costly than most natural ingredients due to various factors such as the long synthesis routes, low availability of precursor chemicals, and low overall yield. However, due to their low odor threshold, they should be diluted when making a perfume.
|}

==Obtaining natural odorants==
{{main|Fragrance extraction}}
[[File:Itar vendor in Hyderabad.JPG|thumb|Itar (herbal perfume) vendor on the street of [[Hyderabad]], India, who can compose an original perfume for the customer]]
Before perfumes can be composed, the odorants used in various perfume compositions must first be obtained. Synthetic odorants are produced through [[organic synthesis]] and purified. Odorants from natural sources require the use of various methods to extract the aromatics from the raw materials. The results of the extraction are either [[essential oil]]s, absolutes, concretes, or butters, depending on the amount of [[wax]]es in the extracted product.&lt;ref name=Camps&gt;Camps, Arcadi Boix (2000). "Perfumery Techniques in Evolution". ''Allured Pub Corp''. {{ISBN|0-931710-72-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All these techniques will, to a certain extent, distort the odor of the aromatic compounds obtained from the raw materials. This is due to the use of heat, harsh solvents, or through exposure to oxygen in the extraction process which will denature the aromatic compounds, which either change their odor character or renders them odorless.
* '''[[Solvent extraction|Maceration/Solvent extraction]]''': The most used and economically important technique for extracting aromatics in the modern perfume industry. Raw materials are submerged in a solvent that can dissolve the desired aromatic compounds. ''Maceration'' lasts anywhere from hours to months. Fragrant compounds for woody and fibrous plant materials are often obtained in this manner as are all aromatics from animal sources. The technique can also be used to extract odorants that are too volatile for ''distillation'' or easily [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] by heat. Commonly used solvents for ''maceration/solvent extraction'' include [[ethane]], [[hexane]], and [[dimethyl ether]]. The product of this process is called a "[[Concrete (perfumery)|concrete]]."
** ''[[Supercritical fluid extraction]]'': A relatively new technique for extracting fragrant compounds from a raw material, which often employs [[Supercritical carbon dioxide|Supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Due to the low heat of process and the relatively nonreactive solvent used in the extraction, the fragrant compounds derived often closely resemble the original odor of the raw material.
**''[[Ethanol extraction]]'': A type of solvent extraction used to extract fragrant compounds directly from dry raw materials, as well as the impure oily compounds materials resulting from solvent extraction or enfleurage. Ethanol extraction from fresh plant materials contain large quantities of water, which will also be extracted into the ethanol.
* '''[[Distillation]]''': A common technique for obtaining aromatic compounds from [[plant]]s, such as [[orange blossom]]s and [[rose]]s. The raw material is heated and the fragrant compounds are re-collected through [[condensation]] of the distilled vapor.
[[File:Fragonard small perfume distillery.JPG|thumb|upright|An old perfume still on display at [[Musée du Parfum|Fragonard]]]]
** ''Steam distillation'': Steam from boiling water is passed through the raw material, which drives out their volatile fragrant compounds. The condensate from distillation are settled in a [[Florentine flask]]. This allows for the easy separation of the fragrant oils from the water. The water collected from the condensate, which retains some of the fragrant compounds and oils from the raw material is called [[hydrosol]] and sometimes sold. This is most commonly used for fresh plant materials such as [[flower]]s, [[leaf|leaves]], and [[Plant stem|stems]].
** ''Dry/destructive distillation'': The raw materials are directly heated in a still without a carrier solvent such as water. Fragrant compounds that are released from the raw material by the high heat often undergo anhydrous [[pyrolysis]], which results in the formation of different fragrant compounds, and thus different fragrant notes. This method is used to obtain fragrant compounds from fossil [[amber]] and fragrant [[wood]]s where an intentional "burned" or "toasted" odor is desired.
** ''Fractionation'': Through the use of a [[fractionation column]], different fractions distilled from a material can be selectively excluded to modify the scent of the final product. Although the product is more expensive, this is sometimes performed to remove unpleasant or undesirable scents of a material and affords the perfumer more control over their composition process.
* '''Expression''': Raw material is squeezed or compressed and the [[essential oil]]s are collected. Of all raw materials, only the fragrant oils from the peels of fruits in the citrus family are extracted in this manner since the oil is present in large enough quantities as to make this extraction method economically feasible.
* '''[[Enfleurage]]''': Absorption of aroma materials into solid fat or wax and then extraction of odorous oils with [[ethanol|ethyl alcohol]]. Extraction by [[enfleurage]] was commonly used when [[distillation]] was not possible because some fragrant compounds [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]] through high heat. This technique is not commonly used in the modern industry due to prohibitive costs and the existence of more efficient and effective extraction methods.&lt;ref name=Fortineau/&gt;

==Fragrant extracts==
[[File:38034290 aromater3.jpg|thumb|upright|Indian Patchouli - Tincture]]
Although fragrant extracts are known to the general public as the generic term "[[essential oil]]s", a more specific language is used in the fragrance industry to describe the source, purity, and technique used to obtain a particular fragrant extract.
Of these extracts, only ''absolutes'', ''essential oils'', and ''tinctures'' are directly used to formulate perfumes.
*'''Absolute''': Fragrant materials that are purified from a ''pommade'' or ''concrete'' by soaking them in [[ethanol]]. By using a slightly [[hydrophilic]] compound such as ethanol, most of the fragrant compounds from the waxy source materials can be extracted without dissolving any of the fragrantless waxy molecules. Absolutes are usually found in the form of an oily liquid.
*'''Concrete''': Fragrant materials that have been extracted from raw materials through ''solvent extraction'' using volatile [[hydrocarbon]]s. Concretes usually contain a large amount of wax due to the ease in which the solvents dissolve various [[hydrophobic]] compounds. As such concretes are usually further purified through distillation or ethanol based solvent extraction. Concretes are typically either waxy or resinous solids or thick oily liquids.
*'''[[Essential oil]]''': Fragrant materials that have been extracted from a source material directly through ''distillation'' or ''expression'' and obtained in the form of an oily liquid. Oils extracted through expression are sometimes called ''expression oils''.
*'''Pomade''': A fragrant mass of solid fat created from the ''[[enfleurage]]'' process, in which odorous compounds in raw materials are adsorbed into animal fats. Pommades are found in the form of an oily and sticky solid.
*'''[[Tincture]]''': Fragrant materials produced by directly soaking and infusing raw materials in [[ethanol]]. Tinctures are typically thin liquids.&lt;ref name=Fortineau/&gt;

Products from different extraction methods are known under different names even though their starting materials are the same. For instance, orange blossoms from ''[[Citrus aurantium]]'' that have undergone solvent extraction produces "orange blossom absolute" but that which have been steam distilled is known as "neroli oil".

==Composing perfumes==
[[File:Lesbos - Perfume formula by Will Inrig.jpg|thumb|Perfume formula]]

Perfume compositions are an important part of many industries ranging from the luxury goods sectors, food services industries, to manufacturers of various household chemicals. The purpose of using perfume or fragrance compositions in these industries is to affect customers through their [[olfaction|sense of smell]] and entice them into purchasing the perfume or perfumed product. As such there is significant interest in producing a perfume formulation that people will find aesthetically pleasing.

===The perfumer===
{{main|Perfumer}}
[[File:Ernst, Rodolphe - The Perfume Maker.jpg|thumb|left|''The Perfume Maker'', by [[Rodolphe Ernst]]]]
The job of composing perfumes that will be sold is left up to an expert on perfume composition or known in the fragrance industry as the ''perfumer''. They are also sometimes referred to affectionately as a "''Nez''" (French for ''nose'') due to their fine sense of smell and skill in smell composition.

The composition of a perfume typically begins with a ''brief'' by the perfumer's employer or an outside customer. The customers to the perfumer or their employers, are typically fashion houses or large [[corporation]]s of various industries.&lt;ref&gt;Islam, G., Endrissat, N., &amp; Noppeney, C. (2016). Beyond “the Eye” of the Beholder: Scent innovation through analogical reconfiguration. Organization Studies, 0170840615622064. http://doi.org/10.1177/0170840615622064.&lt;/ref&gt; The perfumer will then go through the process of blending multiple perfume mixtures and sell the formulation to the customer, often with modifications of the composition of the perfume. 
The perfume composition will then be either used to enhance another product as a ''functional fragrance'' ([[shampoo]]s, [[make-up]], [[detergent]]s, car interiors, etc.), or marketed and sold directly to the public as a ''fine fragrance''.&lt;ref name=Burr /&gt;

===Technique===
[[File:Blotter strips.jpg|right|thumb|Paper blotters (fr:''mouillettes'') are commonly used by perfumers to sample and smell perfumes and odorants.]]
Although there is no single "correct" technique for the formulation of a perfume, there are general guidelines as to how a perfume can be constructed from a concept. Although many ingredients do not contribute to the smell of a perfume, many perfumes include colorants and anti-oxidants to improve the marketability and shelf life of the perfume, respectively.

====Basic framework====
Perfume oils usually contain tens to hundreds of ingredients and these are typically organized in a perfume for the specific role they will play. These ingredients can be roughly grouped into four groups:
*''Primary scents'' (Heart): Can consist of one or a few main ingredients for a certain concept, such as "rose". Alternatively, multiple ingredients can be used together to create an "abstract" primary scent that does not bear a resemblance to a natural ingredient. For instance, jasmine and rose scents are commonly blends for abstract floral fragrances. [[Cola]] flavourant is a good example of an abstract primary scent.
*''Modifiers'': These ingredients alter the primary scent to give the perfume a certain desired character: for instance, fruit [[ester]]s may be included in a floral primary to create a fruity floral; [[calone]] and citrus scents can be added to create a "fresher" floral. The cherry scent in cherry cola can be considered a modifier.
*''Blenders'': A large group of ingredients that smooth out the transitions of a perfume between different "layers" or bases. These themselves can be used as a major component of the primary scent. Common blending ingredients include [[linalool]] and hydroxycitronellal.
*''Fixatives'': Used to support the primary scent by bolstering it. Many resins, wood scents, and amber bases are used as fixatives.

The top, middle, and base notes of a fragrance may have separate primary scents and supporting ingredients. The perfume's [[fragrance oil]]s are then blended with [[Ethanol|ethyl alcohol]] and water, aged in tanks for several weeks and filtered through processing equipment to, respectively, allow the perfume ingredients in the mixture to stabilize and to remove any sediment and particles before the solution can be filled into the perfume bottles.&lt;ref name=cbyear&gt;{{Cite book| first=Chandler| last=Burr| title=The Perfect Scent: A Year Inside the Perfume Industry in Paris &amp; New York| publisher=Henry Holt and Co.| year=2008| isbn=978-0-8050-8037-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fragrance bases====
[[File:Perfume Organ, Grasse.jpg|upright|thumb|A "perfume organ", where perfumers play around with hundreds of essences, in [[Grasse]]]]
Instead of building a perfume from "ground up", many modern perfumes and colognes are made using ''fragrance bases'' or simply '''bases'''. Each base is essentially modular perfume that is blended from essential oils and aromatic chemicals, and formulated with a simple concept such as "fresh cut grass" or "juicy sour apple". Many of [[Guerlain]]'s ''Aqua Allegoria'' line, with their simple fragrance concepts, are good examples of what perfume fragrance bases are like.

The effort used in developing bases by fragrance companies or individual perfumers may equal that of a marketed perfume, since they are useful in that they are reusable. On top of its reusability, the benefit in using bases for construction are quite numerous:
#Ingredients with "difficult" or "overpowering" scents that are tailored into a blended base may be more easily incorporated into a work of perfume
#A base may be better scent approximations of a certain thing than the extract of the thing itself. For example, a base made to embody the scent for "fresh dewy rose" might be a better approximation for the scent concept of a rose after rain than plain [[rose oil]]. Flowers whose scents cannot be extracted, such as [[gardenia]] or [[hyacinth (plant)|hyacinth]], are composed as bases from data derived from [[headspace technology]].
#A perfumer can quickly rough out a concept from a brief by combining multiple bases, then present it for feedback. Smoothing out the "edges" of the perfume can be done after a positive response.

===Reverse engineering===
Creating perfumes through reverse engineering with analytical techniques such as [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry]] (GC/MS) can reveal the "general" formula for any particular perfume. The difficulty of GC/MS analysis arises due to the complexity of a perfume's ingredients. This is particularly due to the presence of natural essential oils and other ingredients consisting of complex chemical mixtures. However, "anyone armed with good GC/MS equipment and experienced in using this equipment can today, within days, find out a great deal about the formulation of any perfume... customers and competitors can analyze most perfumes more or less precisely."&lt;ref&gt;Calkin, Robert R. &amp; Jellinek, J. Stephen (1994). "Perfumery: practice and principles". ''John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.''. {{ISBN|0-471-58934-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antique or badly preserved perfumes undergoing this analysis can also be difficult due to the numerous degradation by-products and impurities that may have resulted from breakdown of the odorous compounds. Ingredients and compounds can usually be ruled out or identified using [[gas chromatograph]] (GC) smellers, which allow individual chemical components to be identified both through their physical properties and their scent. Reverse engineering of best-selling perfumes in the market is a very common practice in the fragrance industry due to the relative simplicity of operating GC equipment, the pressure to produce marketable fragrances, and the highly lucrative nature of the perfume market.&lt;ref name=cbyear/&gt;

===Copyright===
[[File:Fakeperfumes.jpg|right|thumb|[[Counterfeit]] perfumes]]
It is doubtful whether perfumes qualify as appropriate copyright subject matter under the US [[Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act]]. The issue has not yet been addressed by any US court. A perfume's scent is not eligible for [[trademark]] protection because the scent serves as the functional purpose of the product.&lt;ref name="cp"&gt;{{citation | author=David A. Einhorn | author2=Lesley Portnoy | title=The Copyrightability of Perfumes: I Smell a Symphony | journal=Intellectual Property Today |date=April 2010 | url=http://www.iptoday.com/issues/2010/04/the-copyrightability-perfumes-i-smell-symphony.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the [[Dutch Supreme Court]] granted copyright protection to [[Lancôme]]'s perfume ''Tresor'' (''Lancôme v. Kecofa''). The [[French Supreme Court]] has twice taken the position that perfumes lack the creativity to constitute copyrightable expressions (''Bsiri-Barbir v. Haarman &amp; Reimer'', 2006; ''Beaute Prestige International v. Senteur Mazal'', 2008).&lt;ref name="cp" /&gt;

==Health and environmental issues==

Perfume ingredients, regardless of natural or synthetic origins, may all cause health or environmental problems when used. Although the areas are under active research, much remains to be learned about the effects of fragrance on human health and the environment.

===Health===

====Immunological; asthma and allergy====
Evidence in peer-reviewed journals shows that some fragrances can cause asthmatic reactions in some individuals, especially those with severe or atopic asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kumar P, Caradonna-Graham VM, Gupta S, Cai X, Rao PN, Thompson J |title=Inhalation challenge effects of perfume scent strips in patients with asthma |journal=Ann. Allergy Asthma Immunol. |volume=75 |issue=5 |pages=429–33 |date=November 1995 |pmid=7583865 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many fragrance ingredients can also cause headaches, allergic skin reactions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Frosch PJ, Rastogi SC, Pirker C, etal |title=Patch testing with a new fragrance mix – reactivity to the individual constituents and chemical detection in relevant cosmetic products |journal=Contact Derm. |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=216–25 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15859994 |doi=10.1111/j.0105-1873.2005.00563.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or nausea.&lt;ref name="GushmanHanaHou"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hanahou.com/pages/magazine.asp?Action=DrawArticle&amp;ArticleID=373&amp;MagazineID=23 | author= Deborah Gushman |title= The Nose Knows | accessdate=7 May 2008 | publisher=www.hanahou.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Apostolidis S, Chandra T, Demirhan I, Cinatl J, Doerr HW, Chandra A |title=Evaluation of carcinogenic potential of two nitro-musk derivatives, musk xylene and musk tibetene in a host-mediated in vivo/in vitro assay system |journal=Anticancer Res. |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=2657–62 |year=2002 |pmid=12529978 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmeiser HH, Gminski R, Mersch-Sundermann V |title=Evaluation of health risks caused by musk ketone |journal=Int J Hyg Environ Health |volume=203 |issue=4 |pages=293–9 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11434209 |doi= 10.1078/1438-4639-00047|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, an excessive use of perfumes may cause [[allergy|allergic]] reactions of the skin. For instance, [[acetophenone]], [[ethyl acetate]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} and [[acetone]]&lt;ref name=cbyear/&gt; while present in many perfumes, are also known or potential respiratory [[allergen]]s. Nevertheless, this may be misleading, since the harm presented by many of these chemicals (either natural or synthetic) is dependent on environmental conditions and their concentrations in a perfume. For instance, linalool, which is listed as an irritant, causes skin irritation when it degrades to peroxides, however the use of antioxidants in perfumes or reduction in concentrations can prevent this. As well, the [[furanocoumarin]] present in natural extracts of grapefruit or [[celery]] can cause severe allergic reactions and increase sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Furanocoumarins as potent chemical defenses |first=May |last=Berenbaum |url=http://www.life.illinois.edu/berenbaum/newpage1.htm|date=June 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research on natural aromatics have shown that many contain compounds that cause skin irritation.&lt;ref name="udgiv"&gt;Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products [http://www2.mst.dk/common/Udgivramme/Frame.asp?pg=http://www2.mst.dk/udgiv/Publications/2001/87-7944-596-9/html/kap12_eng.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232246/http://www2.mst.dk/common/Udgivramme/Frame.asp?pg=http%3A%2F%2Fwww2.mst.dk%2Fudgiv%2FPublications%2F2001%2F87-7944-596-9%2Fhtml%2Fkap12_eng.htm|date=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However some studies, such as IFRA's research claim that [[opoponax]] is too dangerous to be used in perfumery, still lack scientific consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_sccp/docs/sccp_o_025b.pdf|title=EC.europa.eu|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also true that sometimes inhalation alone can cause skin irritation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[File:Epikutanni-test.jpg|thumb|[[Patch test]]]]

Balsam of Peru is used as a marker for [[perfume allergy]]. Its presence in a cosmetic is denoted by the [[INCI]] term ''Myroxylon pereirae''.&lt;ref name="rook"&gt;{{citation | author=M. H. Beck | author2=S. M. Wilkinson | chapter=Contact Dermatitis: Allergic | title=Rook's Textbook of Dermatology | volume=2 | edition=8th | year=2010 | publisher=Wiley | page=26.40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balsam of Peru has been banned by the [[International Fragrance Association]] since 1982 from use as a fragrance compound, but may be present as an extract or distillate in other products, where mandatory labelling is not required for usage of 0.4% or less.&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt;

====Carcinogenicity====
There is scientific evidence that nitro-musks such as [[musk xylene]] could cause cancer in some specific animal tests. These reports were evaluated by the EU Scientific Committee for Consumer Safety (SCCS, formerly the SCCNFP &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/index_en.htm|title=Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) - Public Health - European Commission|website=Public Health|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and musk xylene was found to be safe for continued use in cosmetic products.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/sccp/documents/out280_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is in fact part of the procedures of the Cosmetic Regulation in Europe that materials classified as carcinogens require such a safety evaluation by the authorities to be allowed in cosmetic consumer products.

Although other ingredients such as polycyclic [[synthetic musk]]s, have been reported to be positive in some in-vitro hormone assays,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Schreurs RH, Legler J, Artola-Garicano E, etal |title=In vitro and in vivo antiestrogenic effects of polycyclic musks in zebrafish |journal=Environ.

For example, for one of the main polycyclic musks [[Galaxolide|Galaxolide (HHCB)]] these reviews includes those of the EU Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety,&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/sccp/documents/out179_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the EU's Priority Substances Review,&lt;ref&gt;http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/947def3b-bbbf-473b-bc19-3bda7a8da910&lt;/ref&gt; the EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risk,&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_scher/docs/scher_o_086.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently also the US EPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oppt/existingchemicals/pubs/workplans.html|title=TSCA Work Plan Chemicals - Existing Chemicals - OPPT - US EPA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of all of these reviews over the past decade or so is that there is no safety concerns for human health. Reviews with similar positive outcome exists for another main polycyclic musk (AHTN) as well for instance on its safe use in cosmetics by the EU.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/sccp/documents/out176_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Toxicity====
Certain chemicals found in perfume are often toxic, at least for small insects if not for humans. For example, the compound Tricyclodecenyl allyl ether is often found in synthetic perfumes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/55017187/Insect-Repellents---Patent-6660288|title=Insect Repellents – PDF|work=Docstoc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/EP1119250.html|title=INSECT REPELLENTS – QUEST INTERNATIONAL B.V.|work=freepatentsonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has [[insect repellent]] property.

===Environmental===

====Pollution====
Synthetic musks are pleasant in smell and relatively inexpensive, as such they are often employed in large quantities to cover the unpleasant scent of laundry detergents and many personal cleaning products. Due to their large-scale use, several types of synthetic musks have been found in human fat and milk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duedahl-Olesen L, Cederberg T, Pedersen KH, Højgård A |title=Synthetic musk fragrances in trout from Danish fish farms and human milk |journal=Chemosphere |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=422–31 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16182860 |doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2005.02.004 |url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/synthetic-musk-fragrances-in-trout-from-danish-fish-farms-and-human-milk(477f6612-140a-40f8-b794-fd61aca8aaab).html}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the sediments and waters of the [[Great Lakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Peck AM, Linebaugh EK, Hornbuckle KC |title=Synthetic Musk Fragrances in Lake Erie and Lake Ontario Sediment Cores |journal=Environ. Sci. Technol. |volume=40 |issue=18 |pages=5629–35 |date=September 2006 |pmid=17007119 |doi= 10.1021/es060134y|url= |pmc=2757450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These pollutants may pose additional health and environmental problems when they enter human and animal diets.

====Species endangerment====
The demands for aromatic materials such as sandalwood, agarwood, and musk have led to the endangerment of these species, as well as illegal trafficking and harvesting.

===Safety regulations===
The perfume industry in the US is not directly regulated by the FDA, instead the FDA controls the safety of perfumes through their ingredients and requires that they be tested to the extent that they are ''[[Generally recognized as safe]]'' (GRAS). Due to the need for protection of trade secrets, companies rarely give the full listing of ingredients regardless of their effects on health. In Europe, as from 11 March 2005, the mandatory listing of a set of 26 recognized fragrance allergens was enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:066:0026:0035:EN:PDF|title="DIRECTIVE 2003/15/EC"|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement to list these materials is dependent on the intended use of the final product. The limits above which the allegens are required to be declared are 0.001% for products intended to remain on the skin, and 0.01% for those intended to be rinsed off. This has resulted in many old perfumes like chypres and [[fougère]] classes, which require the use of oakmoss extract, being reformulated.

==Preserving perfume==
[[File:Dokumentation av utställningen Passion för parfym, 2007, Hallwylska museet - Hallwylska museet - 86456.tif|thumb|upright|Perfumes in a museum]]

Fragrance compounds in perfumes will degrade or break down if improperly stored in the presence of [[heat]], [[light]], [[oxygen]], and [[Dirt|extraneous organic materials]].
Proper preservation of perfumes involves keeping them away from sources of heat and storing them where they will not be exposed to light. An opened bottle will keep its aroma intact for several years, as long as it is well stored.&lt;ref name=Burr /&gt; However, the presence of oxygen in the head space of the bottle and environmental factors will in the long run alter the smell of the fragrance.

Perfumes are best preserved when kept in light-tight [[aluminium]] bottles or in their original packaging when not in use, and refrigerated to relatively low temperatures: between 3–7&amp;nbsp;°C (37–45&amp;nbsp;°F). Although it is difficult to completely remove oxygen from the headspace of a stored flask of fragrance, opting for spray dispensers instead of rollers and "open" bottles will minimize oxygen exposure. Sprays also have the advantage of isolating fragrance inside a bottle and preventing it from mixing with dust, skin, and detritus, which would degrade and alter the quality of a perfume.

There exist several [[archives]] and [[museums]] devoted to the preservation of historical perfumes, namely the [[Osmothèque]], which stocks over 3,000 perfumes from the past two millennia in their original formulations. All scents in their collection are preserved in non-[[actinic]] glass flasks flushed with [[argon]] gas, stored in [[Thermal insulation|thermally insulated]] compartments maintained at {{convert|12|°C|°F|1}} in a large vault.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beautyfashion.com/archives/LOsmotheque.html Colton, Sarah, "L’Osmothèque—Preserving The Past To Ensure The Future", Beauty Fashion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615174831/http://www.beautyfashion.com/archives/LOsmotheque.html |date=15 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religious art''' or '''sacred art''' is artistic imagery using religious inspiration and motifs and is often intended to uplift the mind to the spiritual. Sacred art involves the ritual and cultic practices and practical and operative aspects of the path of the spiritual realization within the artist's religious tradition.

==Christian art==
{{main|Christian Art|Art in Roman Catholicism|Byzantine art}}
{{see also|Religious image#Christianity|Madonna (art)|Icon|Images of Jesus}}

Christian sacred art is produced in an attempt to illustrate, supplement and portray in tangible form the principles of [[Christianity]], though other definitions are possible.It is to make imagery of the different beliefs in the world and what it looks like.Most Christian groups use or have used art to some extent, although some have had strong objections to some forms of religious image, and there have been major periods of [[iconoclasm]] within Christianity. Most Christian art is allusive, or built around [[theme (literary)|theme]]s familiar to the intended observer. One of the most common Christian themes is that of the Virgin Mary holding the [[Child Jesus|infant Jesus]]. Another is that of [[Christ]] on the [[Cross]]. For the benefit of the illiterate, an elaborate [[iconographic]] system developed to conclusively identify scenes. For example, [[Saint Agnes]] depicted with a lamb, [[Saint Peter]] with keys, [[Saint Patrick]] with a shamrock. Each saint holds or is associated with attributes and symbols in sacred art.

===History===
[[Image:VirgenNino.jpg|thumb|left|Virgin and Child. Wall painting from the early [[catacombs]], Rome, 4th century.]]
[[Early Christian art]] survives from dates near the origins of Christianity. The oldest surviving Christian paintings are from the site at [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], dated to around the year 70, and the oldest Christian sculptures are from [[sarcophagi]], dating to the beginning of the 2nd century. Until the [[Constantine I and Christianity|adoption of Christianity by Constantine]] Christian art derived its style and much of its [[iconography]] from popular [[Roman art]], but from this point grand Christian buildings built under imperial patronage brought a need for Christian versions of Roman elite and official art, of which [[mosaic]]s in churches in Rome are the most prominent surviving examples.

During the development of Christian art in the [[Byzantine empire]] (see [[Byzantine art]]), a more abstract aesthetic replaced the naturalism previously established in [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] art. This new style was hieratic, meaning its primary purpose was to convey religious meaning rather than accurately render objects and people. Realistic perspective, proportions, light and colour were ignored in favour of geometric simplification of forms, reverse perspective and standardized conventions to portray individuals and events. The controversy over the use of ''graven images'', the interpretation of the Second Commandment, and the crisis of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] led to a standardization of religious imagery within the [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].

[[Image:Sandro Botticelli 061.jpg|110 px|thumb|right|An example of a [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]], commissioned by the [[Catholic Church]] during the [[Renaissance]].]]

The Renaissance saw an increase in monumental secular works, but until the [[Protestant Reformation]] Christian art continued to be produced in great quantities, both for churches and clergy and for the laity. During this time, [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]] painted the [[Sistine Chapel]] and carved the famous ''[[Pietà]]'', [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]] created the massive columns in [[St. Peter's Basilica]], and [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] painted the ''[[Last Supper]]''. The Reformation had a [[The Reformation and art|huge effect on Christian art]], rapidly bringing the production of public Christian art to a virtual halt in Protestant countries, and causing the destruction of most of the art that already existed.

As a secular, non-sectarian, universal notion of art arose in 19th-century Western Europe, secular artists occasionally treated Christian themes ([[Bouguereau]], [[Manet]]). Only rarely was a Christian artist included in the historical canon (such as [[Georges Rouault|Rouault]] or [[Stanley Spencer]]). However many modern artists such as [[Eric Gill]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Jacob Epstein]], [[Elizabeth Frink]] and [[Graham Sutherland]] have produced well-known works of art for churches.&lt;ref&gt;Beth Williamson, ''Christian Art: A Very Short Introduction'', [[Oxford University Press]] (2004), page 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Through a social interpretation of Christianity, [[Fritz von Uhde]] also revived the interest in sacred art, though the depiction of Jesus in ordinary places in life.

Since the advent of printing, the sale of reproductions of pious works has been a major element of popular Christian culture. In the 19th century, this included genre painters such as [[Mihály Munkácsy]]. The invention of color lithography led to broad circulation of [[holy card]]s. In the modern era, companies specializing in modern commercial Christian artists such as [[Thomas Blackshear]] and [[Thomas Kinkade]], although widely regarded in the fine art world as [[kitsch]],&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia A. Freeland, ''But Is It Art?: An Introduction to Art Theory'', Oxford University Press (2001), page 95&lt;/ref&gt; have been very successful.

The last part of the 20th and the first part of the 21st century have seen a focused effort by artists who claim faith in Christ to re-establish art with themes that revolve around faith, Christ, God, the Church, the Bible and other classic Christian themes as worthy of respect by the secular art world. Artists such as [[Makoto Fujimura]] have had significant influence both in sacred and secular arts. Other notable artists include [[Larry D. Alexander]], Gary P. Bergel, Carlos Cazares, Bruce Herman, Deborah Sokolove, and [[John August Swanson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.mozaico.net/contemporary-religious-art/ | title=Contemporary Religious Art | publisher=Mozaico | date=21 May 2015 | accessdate=2 June 2015 | author=Buenconsejo, Clara | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929011640/http://blog.mozaico.net/contemporary-religious-art/ | archivedate=29 September 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist art==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2015}}
{{main|Buddhist art}}
Buddhist art originated on the [[Indian subcontinent]] following the historical life of [[Siddhartha Gautama]], 6th to 5th century BC, and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout Asia and the world.

Buddhist art followed believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through [[Central Asia]] and into [[Eastern Asia]] to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as [[Southeast Asia]] to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] art, until Buddhism nearly disappeared in India around the 10th century due in part to the vigorous expansion of [[Islam]] alongside [[Hinduism]].

===Tibetan Buddhist art===
Most Tibetan Buddhist artforms are related to the practice of [[Vajrayana]] or Buddhist tantra.
[[Tibetan art]] includes [[thangka]]s and [[mandala]]s, often including depictions of [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] and [[bodhisattva]]s. Creation of Buddhist art is usually done as a [[meditation]] as well as creating an object as aid to meditation. An example of this is the creation of a [[sand mandala]] by monks; before and after the construction prayers are recited, and the form of the mandala represents the pure surroundings (palace) of a Buddha on which is meditated to train the mind. The work is rarely, if ever, signed by the artist. Other Tibetan Buddhist art includes metal ritual objects, such as the [[vajra]] and the [[phurba]].

===Indian Buddhist art===
Two places suggest more vividly than any others the vitality of Buddhist cave painting from about the 5th century AD. One is Ajanta, a site in India long forgotten until discovered in 1817. The other is Dunhuang, one of the great oasis staging posts on the Silk Road...The paintings range from calm devotional images of the Buddha to lively and crowded scenes, often featuring the seductively full-breasted and narrow-waisted women more familiar in Indian sculpture than in painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?gtrack=pthc&amp;ParagraphID=bdc#bdc |title=History Of Buddhism |publisher=Historyworld.net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major art included mosques and a madonna (art of Mary and possibly her child)

==Islamic  art==
{{main|Islamic art}}
A prohibition against depicting representational images in religious art, as well as the naturally decorative nature of Arabic script, led to the use of calligraphic decorations, which usually involved repeating geometrical patterns and vegetal forms ([[arabesque]]s) that expressed ideals of order and nature. These were used on religious architecture, carpets, and handwritten documents.&lt;ref name="huntfor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/medieval/islamic.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040218232141/http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/medieval/islamic.htm |archive-date=2004-02-18 |dead-url=yes |title=Islamic Art - Islamic Art of Calligraphy and Arabesque |accessdate=2014-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic art has reflected this balanced, harmonious world-view. It focuses on spiritual essence rather than physical form.

While there has been an aversion to potential idol worship through Islamic history, this is a distinctly modern [[Sunni]] view. [[Persian miniature]]s, along with medieval [[depictions of Muhammad]] and [[angels in Islam]], stand as prominent examples contrary to the modern Sunni tradition. Also, [[Shi'a]] Muslims are much less averse to the depiction of figures, including the Prophet's as long as the depiction is respectful.

===Figure representation===
The Islamic resistance to the representation of living beings ultimately stems from the belief that the creation of living forms is unique to God, and it is for this reason that the role of images and image makers has been controversial. The strongest statements on the subject of figural depiction are made in the [[Hadith]] (Traditions of the Prophet), where painters are challenged to "breathe life" into their creations and threatened with punishment on the Day of Judgment. The Qur'an is less specific but condemns idolatry and uses the Arabic term musawwir ("maker of forms," or artist) as an epithet for God. Partially as a result of this religious sentiment, figures in painting were often stylized and, in some cases, the destruction of figurative artworks occurred. [[Iconoclasm]] was previously known in the Byzantine period and aniconicism was a feature of the Judaic world, thus placing the Islamic objection to figurative representations within a larger context. As ornament, however, figures were largely devoid of any larger significance and perhaps therefore posed less challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/figs/hd_figs.htm |title=Figural Representation in Islamic Art &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As with other forms of Islamic ornamentation, artists freely adapted and stylized basic human and animal forms, giving rise to a great variety of figural-based designs.

===Arabesque===
{{main|Arabesque}}

{{empty section|date=October 2018}}

===Calligraphy===
{{main|Islamic calligraphy}}

Calligraphy is a highly regarded element of Islamic art. The [[Qur'an]] was transmitted in Arabic, and inherent within the Arabic script is the potential for ornamental forms. The employment of calligraphy as ornament had a definite aesthetic appeal but often also included an underlying [[talisman]]ic component. While most works of art had legible inscriptions, not all Muslims would have been able to read them. One should always keep in mind, however, that calligraphy is principally a means to transmit a text, albeit in a decorative form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cali/hd_cali.htm |title=Calligraphy in Islamic Art &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From its simple and primitive early examples of the 5th and 6th century AD, the Arabic alphabet developed rapidly after the rise of Islam in the 7th century into a beautiful form of art. The main two families of calligraphic styles were the dry styles, called generally the [[Kufic]], and the soft cursive styles, which include [[Naskh (script)|Naskhi]], [[Thuluth]], [[Nastaliq]] and [[Islamic calligraphy|many others]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sakkal.com/ArtArabicCalligraphy.html |title=Art of Arabic Calligraphy |publisher=Sakkal |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometry===
{{main|Islamic geometric patterns}}

Geometric patterns make up one of the three nonfigural types of decoration in Islamic art. Whether isolated or used in combination with nonfigural ornamentation or figural representation, geometric patterns are popularly associated with Islamic art, largely due to their aniconic quality. These abstract designs not only adorn the surfaces of monumental Islamic architecture but also function as the major decorative element on a vast array of objects of all types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/geom/hd_geom.htm |title=Geometric Patterns in Islamic Art &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rosa Bonheur''''' is an 1898 painting by [[Anna Elizabeth Klumpke]]. The portrait of the French artist [[Rosa Bonheur]] has been in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] since 1922.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rosa Bonheur|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11348|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history and creation==
Bonheur was an artist whom Klumpke "had long admired."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/22.222/|title=Rosa Bonheur {{!}} Anna Klumpke {{!}} 22.222 {{!}} Work of Art {{!}} Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two artists had been corresponding for some time prior to 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rosa-Bonheur|title=Rosa Bonheur {{!}} French painter|last=Kuiper|first=Kathleen|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klumpke was persuaded by a conversation with members of the Douglas Miller family to ask to paint Bonheur.{{Sfn|Klumpke|2001|pp=27-28}} On September 14, 1897, Klumpke wrote to Bonheur, asking if she might paint her portrait.
{{Sfn|Klumpke|2001|p=28}} On March 31, 1898, Bonheur responded, "I am at your disposal, dear mademoiselle, for the portrait."{{Sfn|Klumpke|2001|p=30}}

Kumpke started work on the oil on canvas portrait in June 1898. Klumpke wrote that she "was delighted that Rosa Bonheur had offered of her own accord to pose in women's clothes."{{Sfn|Klumpke|2001|p=31}} Bonheur would not pose for Klumpke every day, saying that she "can't stand long sittings."{{Sfn|Klumpke|2001|p=33}} During the times she posed for Klumpke, the two artists talked about art and literature, told stories, and discussed religion and morality.{{Sfn|Klumpke|2001|pp=37-38}} Klumpke's work on the painting was also dictated by Bonheur, who wanted the younger artist to follow her suggestions about sketching and artwork.{{Sfn|Tamboukou|2010|pp=69-70}} &lt;!--The art historian?--&gt; Maria Tamboukou writes that the interplay of conversation and sittings for the creation of the painting show Bonheur to be "a woman in love" with Klumpke.{{Sfn|Tamboukou|2010|p=70}}

The work depicts French painter [[Rosa Bonheur]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corrinne|first=Tee A.|date=January 1998|title=Reviews: Lesbian Biography|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=lfh&amp;AN=20015&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Lambda Book Report|volume=6|issue=6|pages=27|subscription=yes|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klumpke was also a biographer for Bonheur's life and work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bonheur is depicted sitting at her easel and wearing her medal of the [[Legion of Honour|Legion of Honor]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Bonheur is wearing a long [[frog (fastening)|frogged]] coat and a stiff white collar.{{Sfn|Hird|1904|p=78}} In her hand is a drawing and on the easel is the beginning of a painting of three horses.{{Sfn|Dwyer|2004|pp=73-74}} The expression of Bonheur's face "hovers between the pensive and the provocative," according to &lt;!--the art historian?--&gt; Britta C. Dwyer.{{Sfn|Dwyer|2004|p=74}}

Klumpke remained with Bonheur in France as her companion.  On Bonheur's death in 1899, the year after the portrait was competed, Klumpke inherited Bonheur's home and studio at the [[Château de By]] near [[Fontainebleau]]. The painting was owned by Klumpke and her sister and agent, [[Dorothea Klumpke|Dorothea Roberts]], until 1922.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In that year, Klumpke gifted the work to the Met.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''''Saint Jerome in His Study''''' ({{lang-de|Der heilige Hieronymus im Gehäus}}) is an [[engraving]] of 1514 by the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]]. Saint [[Jerome]] is shown sitting behind his desk, engrossed in work. The table, on the corner of which is a cross, is typical of the [[Renaissance]]. An imaginary line from Jerome's head passing through the cross would arrive at the skull on the window ledge, as if contrasting death and the [[Resurrection]]. The lion in the foreground is part of the traditional [[iconography]] of St. Jerome, and near it is a sleeping dog, an animal found frequently in Dürer's works, symbolizing loyalty. Both creatures are part of Jerome's story in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' (c. 1260), which contained fanciful [[Hagiography|hagiographies]] of saints.

''St. Jerome in His Study'' is often considered as part of a group of three Dürer engravings, the other two being the well-known ''[[Melencolia I]]'' (1514) and  ''[[Knight, Death and the Devil]]'' (1513). Together they have been viewed as representing the three spheres of activity recognized in medieval times: ''Knight, Death, and the Devil'' belongs to the moral sphere and the "active life"; ''Melencolia I'' represents the intellectual; and ''St. Jerome'' the theological and contemplative life.

The composition is intimate, but the viewer has difficulty locating himself in relation to the picture's space. Thomas Puttfarken suggests that while the scene is very close to the observer, Dürer did not intend the viewer to feel present: "the intimacy is not ours, but the saint's as he is engrossed in study and meditation" (94).  Art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]] comments on the perspective:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The position of the sight point, quite far off centre, strengthens the impression of a representation determined not by the objective law of the architecture but by the subjective standpoint of the spectator who is just entering – a representation which owes to precisely this perspective arrangement a large part of its peculiarly 'intimate' effect. (Qtd. in Puttfarken, 94)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Jonah and the gourd vine==
Using a dried [[gourd]] hanging from the rafters, Dürer memorializes Jerome's [[courage]], in the face of a long brewing [[Philology|philological]] controversy&lt;ref&gt;Peter W. Parshall, "Albrecht Dürer's Saint Jerome in his Study: A Philological Reference," The Art Bulletin 53 (September 1971), pp. 303-5, [http://www.oberlin.edu/amam/DurerSt.Jerome.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; with [[St. Augustine]] in his preference&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/bible/jon004.htm Chapter 4 of the Book of Jonah in concurrent Greek:English:Latin versions&lt;/ref&gt; for Greek over Latin nomenclature for the fast-growing plant known in Hebrew as קיקיון (qiyqayown) encountered only this once, in the [[Book of Jonah]]. The [[Old Testament]] text closes abruptly ({{bibleverse|Jonah||4}}) with an epistolary warning&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia article titled '''Jonah''' http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08497b.htm&lt;/ref&gt; based on the [[emblem]]atic trope of a fast-growing vine present in Persian narratives, and popularized widely in certain collections of [[Aesop's fables]] such as [[The Gourd and the Palm-tree]]. Jerome elected to use '''[[Hedera]]''' (from the Greek, meaning ivy) over the more common Latin '''[[cucurbita]]''' from which the related English plant name ''cucumber'' is derived, perhaps to avoid confusion while making a more perfect analogy to the typology of Christ [[:it:File:Christ the True Vine icon (Athens, 16th century).jpg|''"I am the Vine you are the branches"'']]. In fact Augustine's view had already prevailed by Dürer's time.

==High-profile negotiations==
Over the course of his 31 years as a sports agent, Boras has represented hundreds of players on all 30 major league teams and has participated in dozens of high-profile negotiations. Boras's specialty is the record-breaking contract, which he says is the most difficult to achieve because it then provides an "umbrella" from which other players can benefit.&lt;ref name=Rookie/&gt; Boras is well known for identifying sources of leverage for his clients and using them for the clients' advantage. This has included advising draft picks to return to school instead of signing, taking advantage of the right to go to salary arbitration hearings, and advising superstars to wait for free agency instead of taking "hometown discount" contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===1980s===
* Boras's first major contract showdown was between [[Bill Caudill]] and the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] in February 1985. Caudill was eligible for [[Major League Baseball transactions#Free agency and salary arbitration|salary arbitration]], and Boras negotiated a $1.5 million contract that made Caudill the second-highest paid reliever in the game.&lt;ref name=NewYorker/&gt;
* In 1988, Boras represented the top three picks in the amateur draft: [[Andy Benes]], [[Mark Lewis (baseball)|Mark Lewis]] and [[Steve Avery]]. Benes signed for a $235,000 bonus, the largest in baseball history at the time.&lt;ref name=Timeline&gt;{{cite news

  |periodical= [[Baseball America]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The next year, in 1989, Boras negotiated the first multi-year major league contract ever given to a baseball-only amateur, a $1.01 million deal for first overall pick [[Ben McDonald]] with the [[Baltimore Orioles]], which included a $350,000 signing bonus.&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;

===1990s===
* In 1990, Boras stunned baseball officials by securing a record $1.2 million guaranteed major league contract for the #14 pick in the draft, high school pitcher [[Todd Van Poppel]]. The contract included a $500,000 signing bonus.&lt;ref name=Timeline&gt;{{cite news

* In 1991, Boras again set a record by securing a $1.55 million bonus from the [[New York Yankees]] for high school phenomenon [[Brien Taylor]].&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;
* In 1992, Boras negotiated a record five-year, $28 million contract for [[Greg Maddux]] with the [[Atlanta Braves]], eclipsing the second-best offer by $9 million. The contract trailed only [[David Cone]]'s contract in terms of annual value and was two years longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* In 1993, Boras represented the first two picks in the draft, [[Alex Rodriguez]] and [[Darren Dreifort]]. Both eventually received $1.3 million contracts,&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt; although Rodriguez signed against Boras's advice. Boras was demanding a $3 million deal, and nearly prevented Rodriguez from signing at all.
* In 1996, Boras used an obscure provision in the major league rules to have draft picks [[Matt White (minor league pitcher)|Matt White]] (seventh overall pick, [[San Francisco Giants]]) and [[Bobby Seay]] (12th overall pick, [[Chicago White Sox]]) declared free agents. White and Seay both then signed with the expansion [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]], with White receiving a $10.2 million contract and Seay receiving a $3 million bonus, significantly more than what they would have received via the draft process. The following year, [[Major League Baseball]] changed its rules in response to Boras's success in circumventing the draft, which had resulted in at least $25 million in extra money for his clients.&lt;ref name=Goldstein/&gt; For many years, being "outsmarted" by Boras and losing Seay remained a sore spot for White Sox owner [[Jerry Reinsdorf]], one of Commissioner [[Bud Selig]]'s closest allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* In 1997, Boras advised draft pick [[J. D. Drew]] not to accept the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]' $3 million offer. Drew instead signed a professional contract with the independent [[St. Paul Saints]]. Boras and the [[MLBPA]] then filed a grievance to have Drew declared a free agent since only "amateurs" could be subject to what was then known as the "amateur draft". Boras won the argument, but the arbitrator ruled he could not grant Drew free agency since he was not a member of the MLBPA. Instead, Drew re-entered the draft the following year and signed with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] for nearly three times the Phillies' best offer.&lt;ref name="Goldstein"/&gt; [[Major League Baseball]] again was forced to amend its rules because of Boras; the draft is now called the "First Year Player Draft" as a result of the Drew grievance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/draft/|title=First-Year Player Draft|website=Major League Baseball|access-date=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Following the 1997 season, Boras broke the $50 million barrier by negotiating a five-year, $57.5 million contract for [[Greg Maddux]] with the [[Atlanta Braves]], making Maddux the highest paid player in the game.&lt;ref name=Maddux/&gt;
* Only a year later, in 1998, Boras broke the $100 million barrier by negotiating a seven-year, $105 million contract for [[Kevin Brown (right-handed pitcher)|Kevin Brown]] with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Brown dethroned Maddux as the highest-paid player in the game.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;
* Also in 1998, Boras negotiated a seven-year, $87.5 million contract for [[Bernie Williams]] to stay with the [[New York Yankees]], even though the Yankees had made a public statement that they would not exceed $60 million for Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* In 1999, Boras filed a grievance on behalf of [[Adrián Beltré]] because the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] falsified Beltré's [[Dominican Republic]] birth records prior to signing him in 1994. Team representatives changed the records in order to sign Beltré when he was only 15 (under baseball rules international prospects are not eligible to sign until they are 16). In response to Boras's grievance, Commissioner [[Bud Selig]] awarded Beltré damages of $48,500. Additionally, Selig imposed significant penalties on the Dodgers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===2000===
* In 2000, under Boras's supervision, high school prospect [[Landon Powell]] earned his GED following his junior year of high school and then filed the necessary paperwork to make him eligible for that year's draft. Powell went undrafted, since the major league teams did not expect him to be draft eligible, making him a free agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* At the baseball Winter Meetings following the 2000 season, Boras negotiated two record-breaking contracts for clients who had gone first and second overall in the 1993 draft. The former second pick, [[Darren Dreifort]], was the first to sign, with Boras finalizing a five-year, $55 million contract for Dreifort to stay with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] on December 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===2003===
* In December 2003, Boras was a part of the complex multi-party negotiations that would have resulted in [[Alex Rodriguez]] being traded from the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] to the [[Boston Red Sox]]. Boras and Rodriguez offered to accept $12 million in reduced salaries in return for marketing rights and the right for Rodriguez to be a free agent after the 2005 season. The trade was eventually killed by the [[MLBPA]] because it would have cost Rodriguez $30 million in previously guaranteed compensation, setting a bad precedent (from the union's perspective) regarding the renegotiation of guaranteed contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* In 2014, two Boras free agent clients, [[Stephen Drew]] and [[Kendrys Morales]], did not sign until late May and early June respectively. Both players were subject to draft pick compensation under MLB rules, dampening their market. Boras criticized the compensation rules, while the MLBPA launched an investigation into team conduct.&lt;ref name=OlneyInvestigation&gt;{{cite news

* Boras negotiated the largest bonus of any player in the draft for Rodon, $6.582 million for the #3 selection from the [[Chicago White Sox]]. Rodon's bonus was also $860,500 above the "slot value" recommended by [[Major League Baseball]].

'''''Seeker After Truth: A Handbook''''' was written by [[Idries Shah]], one of the foremost writers on [[Sufism]].  It was first published by [[Octagon Press]] in 1982.

Shortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfil the function he had fulfilled while alive. As such, ''Seeker After Truth'' can be read as part of a whole course of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Content==
The book is constructed from a mix of classical teaching tales, letters, question and answer sessions, anecdotes and discussions from dinner meetings.  As such it is part of the large corpus of material that Idries Shah disseminated over a 40 year period specifically for people who wished to absorb Sufi patterns of thought and behaviour in the way that he suggested was appropriate and effective for modern times. He described the process in this book in answer to the question, “What is the reason for the way in which your materials are projected in print? I mean, why do you translate some material, represent other portions, use Eastern similes in some and Western psychological terminology and insights in others?”
[[File:Idries Shah.gif|thumb|right|160px|[[Idries Shah]]]]
He replied, “There are two criteria:

(1) What materials have to be projected at the present time to have the maximum useful effect, and

(2) Who can absorb them and in what format?

“Sufic materials are always presented in accordance with the possibilities. This is because Sufism is not archaeology or hagiography (however much it may resemble them to those who look no further) but effect. Eastern similes that are still viable both in the East and West are used because of this viability. Superseded materials are not regurgitated just because they have been used in former times. Materials are re-presented if this can be usefully done. 'Western' psychological terminology and insights are useful, so they are used.

“Look at the results. The published materials are read and accepted in both the East and West; by scientists as well as theologians, by ordinary readers in addition to specialists of all kinds. In a word, the presentation is effective.
 
“If there were no originating impulse from which the material comes and which indicates how it may be used, we would be forced to present Sufi materials like you would any other dead corpus of lore: you would rearrange, prune and present in accordance with subjective assessments. We do not have to do this, since the material itself provides the guidance to those who can descry it. The question, however, illustrates the mind of the questioner more than anything else; for it presupposes that Sufi materials are like those of any other pursuit, capable of being manipulated by rule or whim. Had the questioner taken into consideration the Sufi fact that the Teaching determines its method of presentation, he would not have needed to ask the question.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, I. (1982) Seeker After Truth: A Handbook. London. Octagon Press. {{ISBN|0-900860-91-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[The Literary Review]] wrote that ''Seeker After Truth'' was, “food for many different kinds of study - a book unlike anything our own society has produced until recently, in its richness, its unexpectedness, its capacity to shock us into seeing ourselves as others see us, both personally and as a society.”

Robert Ornstein and Paul Ehrlich, in their book ''New World New Mind'', recommend ''Seeker After Truth'' and other books by Idries Shah "...for the beginnings of a short course on changing your mind." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''''Baptism of Christ''''' is a painting finished around 1475 in the studio of the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] painter [[Andrea del Verrocchio]] and generally ascribed to him and his pupil [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Some art historians discern the hands of other members of Verrocchio's  workshop in the painting as well. 

The picture depicts the [[Baptism of Jesus]] by [[John the Baptist]] as recorded in the Biblical Gospels of [[Matthew's Gospel|Matthew]], [[Mark's Gospel|Mark]] and [[Luke's Gospel|Luke]]. The angel to the left is recorded as having been painted by the youthful Leonardo, a fact which has excited so much special comment and mythology, that the importance and value of the picture as a whole and within the œuvre of Verrocchio is often overlooked. Modern critics also attribute much of the landscape in the background to Leonardo da Vinci as well.&lt;ref name=attr&gt;http://cavallinitoveronese.co.uk/general/view_artist/45&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is housed in the [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]]. 

==Background and provenance==
[[Andrea del Verrocchio]] was a sculptor, goldsmith and painter who ran a large and successful workshop in Florence in the second half of the 15th century.&lt;ref name=IR&gt;Ilan Rachum, ''The Renaissance: an Illustrated Encyclopedia'', 1979, {{ISBN|0-7064-0857-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his apprentices and close associates were the painters [[Botticelli]], [[Botticini]], [[Lorenzo di Credi]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. 

Verrocchio was not himself a prolific painter and very few pictures are attributed to his hand, his fame lying chiefly in his sculptured works. Verrocchio's paintings, as are typical of Florentine works of that date, are in [[tempera]] on wooden panel. The technique of painting artworks in paint, previously used in Italy only for durable items like parade shields, was introduced to Florence by [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|Dutch and Flemish painters]] and their imported works at around the date that this painting was created.

The painting ''The Baptism of Christ'' was, according to Antonio Billi (1515), commissioned by the Church of S. Salvi, and was later transferred to the Vallumbrosan Sisterhood in Santa Verdiana.&lt;ref name=Chiesa&gt;Angela Ottino della Chiesa, ''The Complete Paintings of Leonardo da Vinci'', Penguin, (1967) {{ISBN|978-0-14-008649-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1810 it entered the collection of the [[Galleria dell'Accademia|Accademia]] and passed to the Uffizi in 1959.&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt; In the 16th century the work was discussed in [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'' in the biographies of both Verrocchio and Leonardo da Vinci.

'''''The Early Ayn Rand: A Selection from Her Unpublished Fiction''''' is an [[anthology]] of unpublished early fiction written by [[Ayn Rand]], first published in 1984, two years after her death. The selections include short stories, plays, and excerpts of material cut from her novels ''[[We the Living]]'' and ''[[The Fountainhead]]''.

==Publishing history==
Author Ayn Rand died in March 1982, after a long career that included four published novels, two [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays, several produced screenplays, and numerous non-fiction essays and speeches. She left her literary estate, including her unpublished manuscripts, to her longtime friend and protégé [[Leonard Peikoff]]. Peikoff compiled a selection of her unpublished fiction into ''The Early Ayn Rand''. Although many of the pieces included were never meant to be published, the collection shows Rand's development as a writer. In the introduction, Peikoff writes he "decided to publish this material because I believe that admirers of Miss Rand will be interested to learn by what steps she developed her literary abilities. They can now see the steps themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Peikoff, Leonard. "Introduction". In {{harvnb|Rand|2005|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This book is volume two of the "Ayn Rand Library" series edited by Peikoff. It was first published in a hardcover edition by [[New American Library]] in 1984. They published paperback edition in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perinn|1990|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revised and expanded edition was published in 2005.

==Contents==
The first edition begins with four unpublished short stories written in the 1920s. The next section starts with a synopsis of ''[[Red Pawn]]'', a 1932 screenplay that was Rand's first professional sale as a writer.&lt;ref&gt;Peikoff, Leonard. "Editor's Preface" to ''Red Pawn''. In {{harvnb|Rand|2005|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed by unpublished excerpts from Rand's first novel, ''[[We the Living]]'', which was completed in 1934 and published in 1936. The section ends with a previously unpublished and unproduced play, ''[[Ideal (play)|Ideal]]'', which was written in the mid-1930s. (''Ideal'' was later produced in 1989 by [[Michael Paxton]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third section begins with ''Think Twice'', a theatrical [[murder mystery]] written in 1939. Peikoff writes that in conversation about this play, Rand told him "She could not ... write a series of mysteries, because everyone would know who the murderers were."&lt;ref&gt;Peikoff, Leonard. "Editor's Preface" to ''Think Twice''. In {{harvnb|Rand|2005|p=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is followed by unpublished excerpts from Rand's 1943 novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]''.

The revised edition adds two short stories. "The Night King" was a previously unpublished story written in around 1926. "The Simplest Thing in the World" was written in 1940 and previously published in a 1967 issue of ''[[The Objectivist]]'' and in Rand's 1969 book ''[[The Romantic Manifesto]]''.

==Reception==
Upon its initial publication in 1984, the book received only a few reviews, which were mostly positive. These included reviews in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berliner|2000|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review for the [[libertarian]] magazine ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'', literature professor [[Stephen D. Cox]] said the collection was "very interesting" and revealed details of Rand's personality, although the writing in the selections was inferior to her previously published work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cox|1985|pp=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking back on the book years later, Rand scholar [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] said reading it is "a pleasurable experience" that shows Rand's "nascent virtuosity".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her article about Rand for ''Contemporary Women Philosophers'', Jenny Heyl said the selections show Rand's "strong flair for the dramatic" and foreshadow themes from her later work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heyl|1995|pp=213–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Mystical Nativity''''' is a painting of circa 1500–1501 by the Italian [[Renaissance]] master [[Sandro Botticelli]], in the [[National Gallery]] in London. Botticelli built up the image using [[oil]] on canvas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/sandro-botticelli-mystic-nativity/*/key-facts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Featherstone, [[Hamilton Kerr Institute]], Cambridge, speaking on ''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece|The Private Life of a Christmas Masterpiece]]'', BBC 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It is his only signed work, and has an unusual [[iconography]] for a [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]].

The Greek inscription at the top translates as: "This picture, at the end of the year 1500, in the troubles of Italy, I Alessandro, in the half-time after the time, painted, according to the eleventh [chapter] of [[Book of Revelation|Saint John]], in the second woe of the Apocalypse, during the release of the devil for three-and-a-half years; then he shall be bound in the twelfth [chapter] and we shall see [him buried] as in this picture".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG1034 National Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; Botticelli believed himself to be living during the Tribulation, possibly due to the upheavals in Europe at the time, and was predicting Christ's Millennium as stated in Biblical text.

It has been suggested that the painting may be connected with the influence of [[Girolamo Savonarola|Savonarola]], whose influence appears in a number of late paintings by Botticelli,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.jstor.org/pss/751506 Botticelli's ''Mystic Nativity'', Savonarola and the Millennium]" by Rab Hatfield in ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', vol.&amp;nbsp;58, 1995 {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece]]''&lt;/ref&gt; though the contents of the image may have been specified by the person commissioning it. The painting uses the medieval convention of showing the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and infant [[Jesus]] larger both than other figures, and their surroundings; this was certainly done deliberately for effect, as earlier Botticellis use correct [[Perspective (graphical)|graphical perspective]].

==Historical context and puzzling aspects==
''The Mystical Nativity'' depicts a scene of joy and celebration, of earthly and heavenly delight, with angels dancing at the top of the painting. At the top of the painting stands Sandro Botticelli's name – but also the apocalyptic and troubling words. And there are dark premonitions – the helpless child rests on a sheet that evokes the shroud in which his body will one day be wrapped, while the cave in which the scene is set calls to mind his tomb. The Kings on the left bear no gifts, but their own devotion. At the top of the painting twelve angels dressed in the colours of [[1 Corinthians 13|faith, hope and charity]] dance in a circle holding olive branches, and above them heaven opens in a great golden dome, while at the bottom of the painting three angels embrace three men, seeming to raise them up from the ground. They hold scrolls which proclaim in Latin, "peace on earth to men of goodwill". Behind them seven devils flee to the underworld, some impaled on their own weapons. In Renaissance times [[Last Judgment]] paintings showed viewers the reckoning of the damned and the saved at the time of Christ's [[Second Coming of Christ|Second Coming]]. In echoing this kind of painting the Mystical Nativity is asking us to think not only of Christ's birth but of his return.." (Jonathan Nelson, Syracuse University in Florence).

The painting emerged from the city of Florence in a time when the fanatical preacher Savonarola held the city in its grip. He had arrived in Florence in 1490 but had been repelled by the artistic glory and enormous wealth that so impressed the world. He preached that this was a corrupt and vice-ridden place. A great scourge was approaching – and then his words had assumed a terrifying reality: the [[Italian War of 1494–1498]]. In 1494 a huge French army invaded Italy and {{FORMATNUM:10000}} troops entered Florence so that the Florentines feared the King of France meant to sack the city. Savonarola stepped into the political vacuum, he met with the French king and persuaded him to leave Florence peacefully. In their gratitude and relief the Florentines increasingly saw the friar as a [[prophet]] and his preaching attracted huge crowds to [[Florence Cathedral]]. Savonarola claimed that Florence could become the new Jerusalem if the citizens would repent and abandon their sinful luxuries – and that included much of their art. His beliefs were made real as groups of evangelical youths went on to the streets to encourage people to part with their luxuries, their lewd pictures, and books, their vanities, combs, mirrors. Botticelli may well have seen his own paintings [[Bonfire of the Vanities|fed to the flames]]. Yet the artist might not have objected because, like much of the city, he too had come under the sway of Savonarola. It seems that a sermon preached by Savonarola bears directly upon the Mystical Nativity.
[[File:Santa Maria del Fiore.jpg|thumb|left|Savonarola's preaching attracted huge crowds to [[Florence Cathedral]] – like much of the city, Botticelli had come under his sway.]]
In one sermon Savonarola preached he set forth a vision that had come to him in which he saw an extraordinary heavenly crown. At its base were twelve hearts with twelve ribbons wrapped around them and written on these in Latin were the unique mystical qualities or privileges of the Virgin Mary – she is 'mother of her father', 'daughter of her son', 'bride of God' etc. Though much of the writing on the ribbons held by the dancing angels is now invisible to the naked eye, [[infra-red reflectography]] has shown that the original words on the angels ribbons correspond exactly to Savonarola's 12 privileges of the Virgin. In his sermon, preached on [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption Day]], Savonarola went on to explore the 11th and 12th chapters of the [[Book of Revelation]] – the precise chapters mentioned in the painting's inscription. He connected the glory of Mary with the imminent coming of the power of Christ on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Rab Hatfield, Syracuse University in Florence, speaking on ''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece|The Private Life of a Christmas Masterpiece]]'', BBC TV 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Girolamo Savonarola.jpg|thumb|upright|In one sermon [[Savonarola]] preached, he set forth a vision that had come to him in which he saw an extraordinary heavenly crown. At its base were twelve hearts with twelve ribbons wrapped around them and written on these were the unique mystical qualities or privileges of the Virgin Mary.]]
For years Savonarola held Florence in his hand but his hard line charismatic rule made him powerful political enemies. He was challenged to prove his holiness by walking through fire and when he refused the tide of opinion turned against him. He was arrested, and under torture confessed to being a false prophet. On 23 May 1498 he was hanged with two of his leading lieutenants, their bodies burnt and their ashes scattered in the river [[Arno]]. Some see the figures of the three men at the bottom of the painting as representatives of the three executed holy men, raised up and restored to grace – but persecution not peace awaited Savonarola's followers and it was in an atmosphere of oppression that Botticelli set out to create the ''Mystical Nativity''.

The painting is on canvas – normally he would have used wood panel – perhaps for a painting with a dangerous message, canvas had the advantage that it could be rolled up and hidden. With his canvas prepared he would sketch a detailed design on paper, then he transferred this to canvas. He drew on many sources – the dancing angels echo his own three graces of ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'', the scurrying devil was inspired by a German woodcut. X-rays show that very little of the original design changed – only an angel's wing was adjusted and trees added over the roof of the stable. Botticelli was now ready to build up the image using tempera paint – the canvas was an experimental medium. To create the heavenly dome Botticelli called on the goldsmith's craft he had learned as a boy. "The symbolism of the gold is to do with the unchanging, untarnished nature of heaven – gold doesn't decay, it doesn't darken like silver. Botticelli would have used an adhesive layer made of oil mixed with [[resin]] – not burnished, the gold just patted down on to the surface, following the surface irregularities of the canvas – a glitter, intricate, it would have helped the jewel like quality of the painting – it would have drawn the eye upwards from the Nativity into Heaven. Faith, hope and charity, [the angels clothed in] white, green and red – but the copper based green pigment has discoloured with time, to bronze. Originally it would have been vibrant." &lt;ref&gt;Rupert Featherstone, speaking on ''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece]]'', BBC TV December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate of the painting==
[[File:Rossetti-golden head.jpg|thumb|left|Rossetti was interested in figures locked in embrace; cf. the embracing figures at the bottom of the ''Mystical Nativity''.]]
Botticelli died in 1510. The ''Mystical Nativity'' remained hidden for another three centuries. Rome at the end of the 18th century was very different to Renaissance Florence – except for the presence of French invaders. Many foreigners left, but not a young Englishman, [[William Young Ottley]]. He was an art lover, and wealthy with a slave plantation in the Caribbean. He bought up many paintings cheaply. At the [[Villa Aldobrandini]] he saw a small, unknown work, Botticelli's ''Mystical Nativity''. Botticelli was then in obscurity.

It arrived in London where Ottley's house became in effect a private museum of Italian masterpieces. After Ottley's death [[William Fuller Maitland]] of Stansted picked up the painting at an auction for £80. When he loaned it to the [[Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857]], it was now on open display. The exhibition's newspaper the ''Art Treasures Examiner'' printed a new engraving of it.
[[File:Edward Burne-Jones The Golden Stairs.jpg|thumb|upright|"All those little toes that are climbing down the stairs – you can see the fascination with the patterns of the toes that are circling in the angels of the ''Mystical Nativity'' ... The ''Mystical Nativity'' worked a particular magic on members of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] circle." [[Edward Burne-Jones]]'s ''The Golden Stairs''&lt;ref&gt;[[Suzanne Fagence Cooper]], speaking on ''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece|Private Life of a Christmas Masterpiece]]''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;From the moment Botticelli's art is shown in Manchester there's a real change in opinion about his work and certainly by the late 1870s, 1880s Botticelli becomes a real cult figure – somebody the artists who aspire to be on the cutting edge of the art world are looking to...[[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] both adapted elements of it for their own work. Burne-Jones copied some of Botticelli's illustrations for [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' into his own sketchbooks. Rossetti demonstrated his affection for Botticelli's work by buying his portrait of ''[[Portrait of a Lady known as Esmeralda Brandini|Smeralda Bandinelli]]'' in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Fagence Cooper, speaking on the BBC programme ''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece]]'' and ''Pre-Raphaelite Art in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&amp;A]]'', V&amp;A Publications 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Ruskin]] helped to give the painting its name; after seeing it in London he referred to Botticelli's 'mystic symbolism'. When Maitland died the [[National Gallery]] in London stepped in. According to [[Nicholas Penny]] the Gallery "was concerned to buy works from the earlier Renaissance – previously it had been its top priority to buy masterpieces which there would be no controversy about at all. There was an element of avant-garde excitement about buying pictures like this in the 19th century." The Gallery had to find £1500, being nearly 20 times what it had fetched just thirty years earlier.

Part of a series of books, ''The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasrudin'' is a collection of [[teaching stories]], [[anecdote]]s and jokes drawn from Middle Eastern folklore and the [[Sufi]] [[Mysticism|mystical]] tradition, which feature the [[Populism|populist]] [[Middle East]]ern philosopher and wise fool, [[Mullah|Mulla]] [[Nasreddin|Nasrudin]].&lt;ref name="iranica"&gt;{{cite web

Thousands of stories have been written around this popular folk character over the centuries, since his purported birth in the 13th century in what is now modern [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt;

==Reception==

[[Douglas Hill]], Literary Editor of the [[democratic socialism|socialist]] ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' weekly magazine, wrote in 1969 that ''The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasrudin'' contained “a great deal of timeless and universal wisdom made accessible and highly attractive with humour”, adding that “conventional responses and received frames of mind are challenged on every page.”&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;{{cite news

In ''[[The New York Times]]'', award-winning writer and later winner of the 2007 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], [[Doris Lessing]] called ''The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasrudin'' “perhaps the most shocking to our assumptions about ‘mysticism’” of Shah's books at the time. She said that this corpus of Nasrudin “jokes” was “deliberately created to inculcate Sufic thinking, to outwit The Old Villain, which is a name for the patterns of conditioned thinking which form the prison in which we all live.”&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes"&gt;{{cite news

In an earlier review in ''[[The Observer]]'', Doris Lessing pointed out that most of the jokes in the book were new to the West; while others could also be found in the written work of Sufis like [[Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī|Rumi]], [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]] and [[Jami]]. She explained that “[Nasrudin's] antics are parallels of the mind's workings, designed to amuse the teahouses, but also for use on other levels”. As an example she refers to their use at an international scientific conference to illustrate problems in physics that were otherwise difficult or impossible to verbalise.&lt;ref name="Observer"&gt;{{cite news
