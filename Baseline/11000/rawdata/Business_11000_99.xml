[[Image:AliAbdullaAl-Ubaydli.gif|thumb|Ali Abdulla Al-Ubaydli (185?–1942).]]

'''Ali Abdulla Al-Ubaydli''' ({{lang-ar|علي عبدالله العبيدلي}}) (born 1850 - died 1942) was a [[merchant]], [[philanthropist]] and pioneer in [[Bahrain]]. At the turn of the 20th century, he was behind building the [[Mina Salman|first modern port]] in Bahrain which was an important step in modernising the country. He also took part in the first attempt to supply the capital city with fresh water. The two wells he built gave water to local residents and to Bahrain's pearl divers.

Ali also supported the creation of the first modern school in Bahrain and, when the first school opened for girls, he encouraged his daughters to enroll. One of his great-grandsons, Dr Mohammad Al-Ubaydli, created a scholarship in his memory.

'''Andrew Hughes''' (アンドリュー・ヒューズ, ''Andoryû Hyûzu'' born 1908 ) is a Turkish-born actor and business executive best known for acting in several Japanese films.&lt;ref name="de Gruyter"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most notable role was that of [[Adolf Hitler]] in the 1965 Japanese comedy ''Crazy Adventure''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tohokingdom.com/movies/crazy_adventure.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes has also appeared in films such as ''[[King Kong Escapes]]'' (1967), ''[[Destroy All Monsters]]'' (1968), ''[[Nihon Chinbotsu (1973 film)|Tidal Wave]]'' (1973), ''[[ESPY (film)|ESPY]]'' (1974), and ''[[Sayonara Jupiter (film)|Sayonara Jupiter]]'' (1984). He also starred in the Hollywood films ''[[The Last Voyage]]'' (1960) and ''[[Flight from Ashiya]]'' (1964) (both partially filmed and set in Japan).&lt;ref name="Afi"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Being virtually exclusively active in the Japanese film industry, Hughes was often cast in the roles of various Westerners, often portraying an international reporter, politician or foreign military officer. Not much is known about Hughes's early, pre-acting years, but it is known that he was born in Ottoman Turkey where he originally worked as a career businessman with some small-time acting experience as an extra. Actor [[Robert Dunham]] asserted that most fellow Western actors in Japan were in fact of Turkish origin as many Turks had fled to Japan after the Turkish revolution by ways of China in order to avoid being drafted to the army. Hughes was ultimately based in Tokyo as an import-export businessman and eventually started making numerous appearances in Japanese films in a career that spanned from the late 1950s to the mid-1980s. As most Westerners appearing in Japanese films at the time spoke little or no Japanese, Hughes was dubbed by Japanese-speaking actors in most of his films.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0400447/bio&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://exploderbutton.com/exploder/andrew-hughes-a-life-in-japanese-pictures/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryfle"&gt;

==Early activism==
Mutambara was president of the Student Representative Council of the University of Zimbabwe in 1988 and 1989. He led anti-government protests at the [[University of Zimbabwe]] which led to his arrest and imprisonment. He was later educated on a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] in 1991, at [[Merton College, Oxford]] in the United Kingdom where he obtained a DPhil in [[Robotics]] and Mechatronics, and in the United States where he spent time as a visiting Fellow&lt;ref&gt;MLK Visiting Professors welcomed",{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2000/mlk-1213.html |title=MLK 1213 |accessdate=2008-08-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104043130/http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2000/mlk-1213.html |archivedate=4 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the same field, including both [[California Institute of Technology]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[FAMU - FSU College of Engineering|Florida A &amp; M University – Florida State University College of Engineering]]. He also worked as a lecturer on Business Strategy and as a consultant for [[McKinsey &amp; Company]].&lt;ref name="outsider"/&gt;

Mutambara criticised government ministers for abusing Zimbabwe's [[land reform in Zimbabwe|land reform program]], engaging in: "monopolistic politics of domination, corruption, and petty bourgeois accumulation."&lt;ref name="monopolism"&gt;Bond, Patrick. ''Uneven Zimbabwe: A Study of Finance, Development, and Underdevelopment'', 1998. Page 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutambara, a self-professed admirer of [[Che Guevara]], has also expressed his intention to visit [[Cuba]] to learn more about its "successful resistance" to [[Cuban embargo|American sanctions]].&lt;ref name="AllAfrica" /&gt; Mutambara added: "We have a lot to learn from Cuba which started [[Cuban Revolution|its revolution]] in 1959, we will continue with our solidarity, continue with the struggle and strengthen our co-operation."&lt;ref name="AllAfrica"&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200908210020.html Zimbabwe: Build on Revolution Legacy, Country Told] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011005116/http://allafrica.com/stories/200908210020.html |date=11 October 2012 }} ''All Africa'', 21 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly output==
From March of 2002 to September of 2003, Mutambara was a professor of [[Operations Management]] at the [[University of South Africa]]'s School of Business Leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Who is Who in Mutare? |publisher=Samanyika &amp; Sons |location=Mutare, Zimbabwe |url=https://sites.google.com/site/cityofmutare/famouspeoplefrommutare?tmpl=%2Fsystem%2Fapp%2Ftemplates%2Fprint%2F&amp;showPrintDialog=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004025845/https://sites.google.com/site/cityofmutare/famouspeoplefrommutare |archive-date=4 October 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutambara has authored at least two books.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Arthur-G.-O.-Mutambara/e/B001KIB98I/ref=sr_tc_2_0 Amazon UK, Books by Arthur G.

Durrant-Whyte|Professor Hugh F. Durrant-Whyte]]. According to [[Scopus]] as of 2013 his [[h-index]] was a modest 4.

==Movement for Democratic Change==
In 2005 the MDC split into two factions following a dispute over whether or not to participate in the March 2005 senatorial election. While MDC leader [[Morgan Tsvangirai]], Mutambara, and others opposed participation, [[Welshman Ncube]] and [[Gibson Sibanda]] led a faction that favoured participation.&lt;ref name="outsider"/&gt; Those supporting the senate elections won narrowly against the leader Morgan Tsvangirai's vote. Tsvangirai later overruled and overturned the decision of the plebiscite citing two absent members had sent in postal votes that canceled the slender margin.&lt;ref name="smaller faction"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Zimbabwe Opposition: Mugabe's Price Cuts Mask Deeper Economic Problems |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-15-voa21.cfm |date=15 July 2007 |publisher=''[[VOA News]]'' |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913210005/http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2007-07/2007-07-15-voa21.cfm |archivedate=13 September 2008 |access-date=31 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006 at a Congress of the breakaway faction Movement for Democratic Change, Mutambara was elected as president of the party. Commenting on the election, Mutambara said, "My position was that the MDC should have boycotted those Senate elections. I guess then that makes me the anti-Senate leader of the pro-Senate MDC faction. How ridiculous can we get? That debate is now in the past, let us move on and unite our people."&lt;ref name="outsider"/&gt;

The choice of Mutambara as leader was said to have been inspired by the fact that he is a [[Shona people|Shona]] whereas Sibanda and Ncube are both [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]], but realised that only a Shona candidate could win an election across the whole of Zimbabwe. Mutambara is not a member of the House of Assembly. 

The faction led by Tsvangirai described Mutambara's election as a nullity. In his MDC faction presidential acceptance speech,&lt;ref name="acceptance"&gt;[http://amadlandawonye.wikispaces.com/MDC,+Presidential+acceptance+speech,+A+Mutambara MDC faction presidential acceptance speech]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427135734/http://amadlandawonye.wikispaces.com/MDC%2C%2BPresidential%2Bacceptance%2Bspeech%2C%2BA%2BMutambara |date=27 April 2012 }} Communist University of Johannesburg&lt;/ref&gt; Mutambara stated, "We believe that our views on land reform in Zimbabwe are different from those of Western governments. Our approach is not driven by the interests of [[Whites in Zimbabwe|white]] farmers, but by those of all Zimbabweans, white and black. While we put the failure of the land reform program squarely on the [[ZANU–PF]] government, we also acknowledge the complicity of some Western governments which reneged on agreements, and the inertia of white farmers in seeking pre-emptive solutions." However, [[David Karimanzira]], a leading member of the ZANU–PF, alleged that Mutambara was promoted by the West after Western governments decided not to continue backing [[Morgan Tsvangirai]] because the Zimbabwean people had allegedly rejected his party manifesto. He once called the [[African Union]] a "club of dictators".&lt;ref name="au"&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200706111569.html Zimbabwe: Era of Puppet Politics Over] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013115628/http://allafrica.com/stories/200706111569.html |date=13 October 2012 }} AllAfrica&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutambara was arrested by the Zimbabwe police on 19 May 2006 while leading a march in support of his faction's candidate on the eve of the Budiriro by-election. He was also arrested on 11 March together with other MDC leaders from the other faction. He was released without charge two days later, only to be re-arrested on 18 March at Harare Airport en route to South Africa, where his family is still based, and where he is also a leading consultant. He was also released without charge after three days in custody.

===2008 presidential election===
After Mutambara and Tsvangirai failed to unite on a single MDC candidate for the [[Zimbabwean presidential election, 2008|March 2008 presidential election]], Mutambara said on 15 February that he would not run for president and that his faction would instead back [[Simba Makoni]].&lt;ref&gt;Fikile Mapala, [http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/electoral155.17759.html "Mutambara withdraws from race, backs Makoni"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801030954/http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/electoral155.17759.html |date=1 August 2013 }}, newzimbabwe.com, 15 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutambara instead ran in the [[Zimbabwean parliamentary election, 2008|concurrent parliamentary election]] for a seat from the Zengeza East constituency, but he was placed third, with 1,322 votes, according to official results, behind the candidate of the Tsvangirai faction, who won 7,570 votes, and the ZANU–PF candidate, who won 3,042 votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sokwanele.com/election2008/constituency Results page for Zengeza East] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404060118/http://www.sokwanele.com/election2008/constituency |date=4 April 2008 }} at sokwanele.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tsvangirai faction won 99 seats in the parliamentary election and the Mutambara faction won 10, compared with 97 for ZANU–PF.&lt;ref name=Photo&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200804030001.html "Zanu-PF, MDC-T in photo finish"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002222742/http://allafrica.com/stories/200804030001.html |date=2 October 2012 }}, ''The Herald'' (allAfrica.com), 3 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 April 2008, Mutambara and Tsvangirai announced that their factions were reuniting, thus enabling the MDC to have a clear parliamentary majority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7371823.stm "Opposition reunites in Zimbabwe"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414214358/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7371823.stm |date=14 April 2009 }}, BBC News, 28 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June 2008, Mutambara was arrested at his home in Harare. According to his lawyer, the arrest was due to an article he wrote in ''The Standard'' in April, which allegedly included "falsehoods" and "contempt of court". In this article, he blamed Mugabe for the state of the economy and accused the security forces of committing abuses.&lt;ref&gt;Godfrey Marawanyika, [http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=3045&amp;art_id=nw20080601170729234C285235 "Top Zim opposition figure arrested"] {{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, Sapa-AFP (''IOL''), 1 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 June, Mutambara was released on a bail of 20 million [[Zimbabwean dollar]]s but he did not go to jail, with the next court date being set for 17 June. After the hearing on 3 June, he described his own suffering as minor compared to that of the people, saying that Mugabe's "human rights violations" would fail and vowing, "We will triumph over evil."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=84&amp;art_id=nw20080603132919207C311676 "Top Zim opposition figure freed"] {{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, AFP (''IOL''), 3 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===SADC facilitated power-sharing agreement ===
On 15 September 2008, the leaders of the 14-member [[Southern African Development Community]] witnessed the signing of a power-sharing agreement between the two MDC factions and ZANU-PF. Under the deal, Mugabe remained president, Tsvangirai became prime minister,&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/09/15/zimbabwe.powershare/?iref=mpstoryview edition.cnn.com, Rivals sign Zimbabwe power-share deal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232421/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/09/15/zimbabwe.powershare/?iref=mpstoryview |date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the MDC controlled the police, ZANU-PF controlled the Army, and Mutambara became deputy prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article4756995.ece timesonline.co.uk, Power-sharing deal signed in Zimbabwe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718194732/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article4756995.ece |date=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26715920/ www.msnbc.msn, Zimbabwe power-sharing deal signed] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024163219/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26715920/|date=24 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3631">The '''Association of Corporate Treasurers''' ('''ACT''') is the British [[professional body]] specialising in the profession of [[corporate treasury]]. It was founded in 1979 and was re-established on 1 January 2013 by Royal Charter requiring it to operate in the public interest. It is both an examining body, providing a wide range of qualifications for those working in treasury, risk and [[corporate finance]], and a membership organisation which supports and represents its members.

==Membership==
There are two possible routes to membership of ACT. Most members are individuals who have completed ACT's professional qualifications.

The levels of membership are:

* Associate Membership (AMCT)
* Membership (MCT)
* Fellowship (FCT)
* Corporate Membership
* International Affiliates

Associates use the designatory letters AMCT, while members are entitled to use the letters MCT.  Fellowship is the highest level of membership of the Association and confers the right to use the designatory letters FCT. It is a public recognition of the fact that the individual has made a contribution to the treasury profession.

Many members of the ACT are also [[British qualified accountants|qualified accountants]] who belong to a member organisation of the  [[Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies]].

The ACT is a member of the [[European Association of Corporate Treasurers]] and the [[International Group of Treasury Associations]], the umbrella bodies for corporate treasury organisations in Europe and worldwide.

;Fast-track qualification

Automatic exemption from stage 1 of the AMCT Diploma, the Associate Membership qualification is available for all accountants qualified through [[International Federation of Accountants|IFAC]] member bodies. The ACT also offers a fast-track route for qualified accountants who wish to gain AMCT. This accelerated course of study is open exclusively to [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]] members and affiliates, [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants|CIMA]] members and students, [[ICAEW]] members and [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland|ICAS]] members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080411215937/http://uk.accaglobal.com/uk/members/support/uk/act Association of Corporate Treasurers Qualifications] on [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The ACT works with the British government and other bodies such as the [[Association of British Insurers]] and [[International Capital Market Association]] to help large and medium-sized companies to raise funds through the [[bond market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifaonline.co.uk/ifaonline/news/1598003/budget-2010-boost-bond-issuance-uk-firms |title=Budget 2010: Govt to help boost access to bond market |accessdate= 2010-12-01 |author=Walker, David |date=24 Mar 2010 |work= |publisher=IFAonline |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifaonline.co.uk%2Fifaonline%2Fnews%2F1598003%2Fbudget-2010-boost-bond-issuance-uk-firms&amp;date=2010-12-01 |archivedate=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baldelli family have been making ceramics for four generations. Ceramist Dante Baldelli (1904-1953), a ceramist working since the 1920s, who became the director of Ceramica Rometti di Umbertide,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.porroartconsulting.it/pdf/Porro_asta_34_B.pdf |title=Ceramiche del Novecento: Dante Baldelli |access-date=2011-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125041126/http://www.porroartconsulting.it/pdf/Porro_asta_34_B.pdf |archive-date=2011-11-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; opened his own workshop in 1943, in piazza Gioberti, Città di Castello, accompanied by his brother Angelo and gradually assisted by his oldest son Massimo, who was eight at the time&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archivioceramica.com/FABBRICHE/B/Baldelli.htm Archivio ceramiche: Dante Baldeli]&lt;/ref&gt; but who took over the business at the unexpected death of his father in 1953, aged eighteen; under his leadership production was being sold in US department stores from the 1970s.

During the 1980s, Massimo Baldelli's daughter Simona and her husband Lorenzo Colacicchi joined the family business.&lt;ref&gt;A [http://www.trademarkia.com/baldelli-73297708.html US trademark was issued for Ceramiche Di Riosecco dei figli di Dante Baldelli &amp; C. Soc.], 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the early 1990s the Baldelli studio resited to the country  outside Città di Castello.

The '''Calo tester''', also known as a '''ball craterer''' or '''coating thickness tester''', is a quick, simple and inexpensive piece of equipment used to measure the thickness of coatings.  [[Coating]]s with thicknesses typically between 0.1 to 50 [[micrometre]]s, such as [[Physical vapor deposition|Physical Vapor Deposition]] (PVD) coatings or [[Chemical vapor deposition|Chemical Vapor Deposition]] (CVD) coatings, are used in many industries to improve the surface properties of tools and components.  
The Calo tester is also used to measure the amount of coating [[wear]] after a wear test carried out using a [[pin on disc tester|Pin-on-Disc Tester]].

The Calo tester consists of a holder for the surface to be tested and a [[steel]] [[sphere]] of known [[diameter]] that is rotated against the surface by a rotating shaft connected to a motor whilst [[diamond]] paste is applied to the contact area.  The sphere is rotated for a short period of time (less than 20 seconds for a 0.1 to 5 micrometre thickness) but due to the [[abrasive]] nature of the diamond paste this is sufficient time to wear a crater through thin coatings.
[[File:Calo tester kaloMAX II BAQ.jpg|thumb|Calo Tester]]
== Calculating coating thickness using the Calo tester ==
An [[optical microscope]] is used to take two measurements across the crater after the Calo test and the coating thickness is calculated using a simple geometrical [[equation]]. 

&lt;math&gt;t = \frac{x y}d&lt;/math&gt;

Where
t = coating thickness,
d = diameter of the sphere 
x = difference between the radius of the crater and radius of the part of the crater at the bottom of the coating
x+y = diameter of the crater

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3849">In [[international law]] and [[diplomacy]], a '''''compromis''''' ([[French language|French]] for "special agreement") is an agreement between two parties to submit a dispute to [[international arbitration]] for a [[Dispute resolution|binding resolution]].&lt;ref name="Aust"&gt;Anthony Aust, ''Handbook of International Law'' (Cambr=ress, 2d ed. 2010), pp. 403-04.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''compromis'' is made after a dispute has already arisen, rather than before. (This is in contrast to provisions in existing treaties or protocols made before the dispute arose).&lt;ref name="Aust"/&gt; The ''compromis'' identifies a neutral third party - the arbitrator or arbitral tribunal - or specifies the manner of appointment. The compromis often sets forth the precise question or questions to be decided; the arbitral rules of procedure; the seat of the tribunal; the languages to be used in the proceeding; the applicable law; and the payment of costs.&lt;ref name="Aust"/&gt;

A ''compromis'' to submit a dispute to arbitration can be made ''ad hoc'' by two or more [[Sovereign state|states]], or it can be on the basis of a reciprocol declaration made under the  [[Statute of the International Court of Justice]].&lt;ref name="Aust"/&gt; Article 36(2) of the Statute of the ICJ provides that: "The states parties to the present Statute may at any time declare that they recognize as compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement, in relation to any other state accepting the same obligation, the jurisdiction of the Court in all legal disputes concerning: a. the interpretation of a treaty; b. any question of international law;  c. the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of an international obligation; d. the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach of an international obligation." Article 36(3) provides that: "The declarations referred to above may be made unconditionally or on condition of reciprocity on the part of several or certain states, or for a certain time."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/documents/?p1=4&amp;p2=2#CHAPTER_II Statute of the International Court of Justice, art. 36].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Compromis'' have been used for many years.  Treaties reported by Jean Dumont, a compiler of early treaties, show among many others a 1176/77 dispute between [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Navarra]] over certain territories and castles in Spain was submitted to King [[Henry II of England]] for resolution; an 1177 compromis  and 1180 compromis between [[Henry II of England]] and [[Philip II of France]] submitted a dispute concerning [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] and other territories to arbitration by three bishops and barons on either side; and a June 1298 compromis submitted to [[Pope Boniface VIII]] a dispute between [[Edward I of England]] and [[Philip IV of France]] over English fiefs in France.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. W. Verzijl, ''International Law in Historical Perspective, Part VIII: Inter-State Disputes and Their Settlement'' (1976), pp. 207-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a modern ''compromis'' is the 1996 Special Agreement between [[Botswana–Namibia relations|Botswana and Namibia]], which referred the two countries' dispute over [[Sedudu]] (Kasikili) island to the ICJ for resolution. The ICJ decided the ''Case concerning Kasikili/Sedudu Island'' (Botswana/Namibia) in 1999, ruling for Botswana.&lt;ref name="Aust"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?sum=505&amp;p1=3&amp;p2=3&amp;case=98&amp;p3=5 Case concerning Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia), ICJ Judgment of 13 December 1999].''&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''compromis'' may also be used to submit international investment or trade disputes to arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Dugan et al., ''Investor-State Arbitration'' (2008), Oxford University Press, 242-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Law on Salaried Employees''' ({{lang-da|'''Funktionærloven'''}}), properly ''Lov om retsforholdet mellem arbejdsgivere og funktionærer'' (law on the legal relationship between employers and salaried employees), is a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[law]] which gives [[salaried employee]]s certain rights with regard to termination, vacation, illness, non-solicitation and [[Non-compete clause|non-competition clause]]s, etc.

The first version of the law was adopted in 1938; it was last revised in 2013.

The Act is not a general employment law, because it applies only to certain occupational groups&amp;mdash;those defined under Danish law as salaried. The core group consists of employees engaged in clerical work, trade (for example, shop assistants), inventory processing, technical or clinical work (for example, engineers, nurses and doctors), management, etc. However, executives who are not subject to supervision, for example, [[CEO]]s, are not covered by the law.

In principle, the Act is not applicable to employees engaged in craft or factory work, agriculture, fishery, waiting tables, kitchen work, etc. However, although many sectors of employment are not immediately subject to the law, the law nonetheless applies to a portion of such sectors through employment contracts or agreements which provide that the law is to apply (for example, [[auxiliary nurse]]s, educators, social and health care assistants, and [[Danish Folkeskole Education|Folkeskole]] teachers). In Denmark, these are sometimes referred to as ''aftalefunktionærer'' (contract salaried employees) as opposed to ''lovfunktionærer'' (legal salaried employees), to whom the law automatically applies. Finally, some occupational groups in principle covered by the Act, by virtue of agreements [[Derogation|derogating]] from the law have a legal status which is better or worse than is provided for under the Act.

There is a requirement for the law to be applicable that the employee works at least 8 hours a week on average, and also a requirement that the employee is not a [[civil servant]].

The regulations concerning termination of employment under the Act establish a system of notices of termination based on the employee's length of service, which cannot be derogated from to the detriment of the employee. There is also the possibility of compensation in certain cases.

The regulations concerning non-solicitation and non-competition clauses under the Act entitle the employee to compensation amounting to half pay during the period after leaving the job during which the employee is covered by such clauses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13497">'''Formulary apportionment''', also known as '''unitary taxation''', is a method of allocating profit earned (or loss incurred) by a corporation or corporate group to a particular tax jurisdiction in which the corporation or group has a taxable presence. It is an alternative to separate entity accounting, under which a branch or subsidiary within the jurisdiction is accounted for as a separate entity, requiring prices for transactions with other parts of the corporation or group to be assigned according to the [[arm's length principle|arm's length]] standard commonly used in [[transfer pricing]].  In contrast, formulary apportionment attributes the corporation's total worldwide profit (or loss) to each jurisdiction, based on factors such as the proportion of sales, assets or payroll in that jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="CAYp12"&gt;{{harvnb|Clausing|Avi-Yonah|2007|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When applied to a corporate group, formulary apportionment requires [[combined reporting]] of the group's results.  The parent and all of its subsidiaries are viewed as though they were a single entity (''unitary combination''), and the method is then also known as ''worldwide unitary taxation''.  In the US, most states have adopted water's edge combined reporting which restricts the taxable group to just US domestic corporations and excludes "overseas business organization", i.e., unitary foreign affiliates and foreign parents.

==In domestic taxation==
Formulary methods are used in both the United States and Canada to apportion income of corporations between the sub-national jurisdictions in which they operate.  In many U.S. states formulary apportionment is also used to apportion the combined income of a related group of companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2005|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tax in each US state is thus assessed based on the unitary combination of all related entities.&lt;ref name="MWp254"&gt;{{harvnb|McLure|Weiner|2000|pp=254&amp;ndash;255}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The related entities included in the unitary combination may be worldwide entities or only entities within the United States, depending on the state. The latter is known as water's edge combined reporting. 

Worldwide unitary combined reporting was first approved by the US Supreme Court in 1983 in Container Corp. v. Franchise Tax Board (CA) by a vote of 5-3 (Justice Stevens did not participate). The court re-visited worldwide combined reporting in 1994 in Barclays Bank v. Franchise Tax Board (CA) and Colgate-Palmolive v. Franchise Tax Board (CA) and again approved its use by California but this time by larger majorities.  The votes were 7-2 and 9-0, respectively.  However, as a result of foreign retaliatory legislation and pressure from the federal government, all states have now abandoned mandatory worldwide combined reporting.

The use of formulary apportionment in the United States dates back to the late 19th century. At that time, there was no state or federal corporate income tax, but the states did assess [[property tax|property]] and capital stock taxes. With the growth of the [[transcontinental railroad]]s, state taxation authorities faced companies which had not just [[immovable property]] (tracks) but also non-trivial movable property ([[rolling stock]]) operating across state lines. The property value of a company assessable to state tax was thus assessed by examining the proportion of value of railway lines within the state, and then taking that proportion of the company's total value (including the movable property) as the portion of value located within a certain state. When [[Wisconsin]] adopted a state income tax in 1911, it also used formulary apportionment (based on property, cost of manufacture, and sales), pointing to the impracticality of otherwise calculating separate accounts for companies operating in multiple states.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2005|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-20th century, the "Massachusetts Formula" had become a commonly used standard of formulary apportionment. The formula placed an equal weight on three factors: group sales, payroll, and property within each jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="CAYp12"/&gt; Out of the forty-four states (plus one more jurisdiction, the [[District of Columbia]]) which imposed a corporate income tax in 1978, all but [[Iowa]] used the Massachusetts Formula.&lt;ref name="Mp72"&gt;{{harvnb|Mayer|2008|p=72}}; see also ''Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair'' ([http://supreme.justia.com/us/437/267/ 437 US 267])&lt;/ref&gt; Iowa's formula ignored payroll and property, looking solely at sales; the constitutionality of this formula was challenged in the ''Moorman'' case in Iowa, and it was held invalid by a trial court under the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] as well as the [[Commerce Clause]] of [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]]; however, the [[Iowa Supreme Court]] reversed the trial court in 1978. This marked the beginning of a trend towards increasing weight on sales at the expense of the other two factors; by 2004, there were only twelve states still using an equally weighted formula.&lt;ref name="Mp72"/&gt;

==In international taxation==
Formulary apportionment is not used as a method of attributing profit between (rather than within) national tax jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|OECD|2010|para 1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of formulary apportionment has been advocated at various times since the 1970s.  The matter has been hotly debated by [[OECD]] member states beginning in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2005|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000 Joann Weiner and Charles E. McLure Jr. proposed the use of formulary apportionment within the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLure|Weiner|2000|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001, the EU issued a communication advocating the use of formulary apportionment.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2001:0582:FIN:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Kimberley A. Clausing and Reuven Avi-Yonah suggested that the US [[Internal Revenue Service]] use formulary apportionment in the assessment of federal [[corporate tax in the United States|corporate income tax]], believing it would lead to increased tax revenue in the face of a trend for multinational corporations to use transfer pricing to shift profits out of the US into low-tax countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clausing|Avi-Yonah|2007|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  None of these suggestions has been adopted.

Several US states allow, but do not mandate, that a corporate group include foreign entities for the purpose of assessing factors used in formulary apportionment ("worldwide unitary combination"). California, for example, began to accept worldwide unitary combination in the 1940s. However, its attempt to ''require'' such combination led to strong protests from US trading partners.&lt;ref name="MWp254"/&gt; The UK-US [[double taxation treaty]] signed in 1975 included a provision to prohibit US states from "tak[ing] into account the income, deductions, receipts, or out-goings of a related enterprise" in the United Kingdom or any other country for the purpose of determining tax liability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/uk.pdf US-UK Income Tax Convention (1975)] Article 9(4)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the US Senate, whose consent was required to ratify the treaty, rejected this provision,&lt;ref name="MWp254"/&gt; and the treaty was amended by a protocol in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/uk.pdf US-UK Income Tax Convention (1975)] Protocol 3&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] explicitly held worldwide unitary combination as constitutional in separate cases in 1983 and 1994 ([[Barclays Bank PLC]] v. [[California Franchise Tax Board|Franchise Tax Board]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2204141 114 S.Ct. 2268 ]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985 the United Kingdom passed retaliatory legislation which would have overridden the UK-US tax treaty and denied significant UK tax benefits to corporations headquartered in US states which applied worldwide unitary taxation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/1/section/812/enacted Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 Section 812]&lt;/ref&gt; This and further pressure from foreign governments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://yourdemocracy.newstatesman.com/parliament/unitary-taxation/HAN12824823 Debate in UK Parliament, December 18, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; the executive branch and multinational corporations led US states to adopt a "water's edge" limitation on unitary combination, allowing taxpayers to decide for themselves whether or not to include foreign entities in their combined reporting.&lt;ref name="MWp254"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
Advocates claim that transfer pricing issues increase compliance costs, formulary apportionment reduces those costs and treating associated enterprises in a unitary fashion more closely reflects the underlying operating realities of multinational enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|OECD|2010|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argue:
*Formulary apportionment leads to [[double taxation]] of the same profits unless there is agreement among all the jurisdictions on the formula to be used and the composition of the combined group.
*Tax could be avoided by manipulation of the components of the formula like the location of mobile assets.
*[[Compliance costs]] would be increased by the need to calculate each component of the formula in each jurisdiction.
*Compliance costs would be much higher unless all jurisdictions adopted a common method of calculating [[taxable profit]]s.  Otherwise a separate calculation of worldwide group profits would be required under each jurisdiction's [[tax accounting]] rules. The issue is significantly reduced within the United States and Canada because variations among each jurisdiction's tax accounting methods are relatively minor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taxjournal.com/tj/articles/debate-should-we-move-system-unitary-taxation-18122012&lt;/ref&gt;
*If members of the group account in different currencies, currency [[exchange rate]] movements could distort the results of the apportionment.
*Formulary apportionment does not reflect the economic profit or loss of each entity. For example, a profitable group that incurs a loss in a particular territory has taxable profit apportioned to that territory, and conversely a loss-making group which makes profits in a particular territory has no taxable profits in that territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|OECD|2010|pp=8&amp;ndash;10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geron Corporation''' is a [[biotechnology]] company located in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], California, which specializes in developing and commercializing therapeutic products for [[cancer]] that inhibit [[telomerase]].

==Company information==
Geron, based in [[Menlo Park, California]], was founded by Mary C. West and [[Michael D. West]], now [[CEO]] of [[BioTime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= A Blood Test Offers Clues to Longevity

==Drug candidates==

===Cancer therapies===

Geron Corporation has sponsored human clinical trials of several anti-cancer products. 
* GRN163L (Imetelstat), is a drug that targets telomerase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Imetelstat Sodium|url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-drug?cdrid=447136|website=NCI Drug Dictionary|publisher=National Cancer Institute|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In studies conducted at [[Johns Hopkins University]], GRN163L was active against both CD138+ and CD138neg cancer stem cells and eliminated the colony forming potential of both by five weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brennan|first1=Sarah K.|last2=Wang|first2=Qiuju|last3=Tressler|first3=Robert|last4=Harley|first4=Calvin|last5=Go|first5=Ning|last6=Bassett|first6=Ekaterina|last7=Huff|first7=Carol Ann|last8=Jones|first8=Richard J.|last9=Matsui|first9=William|last10=Swarbrick|first10=Alexander|title=Telomerase Inhibition Targets Clonogenic Multiple Myeloma Cells through Telomere Length-Dependent and Independent Mechanisms|journal=PLoS ONE|date=1 September 2010|volume=5|issue=9|pages=e12487|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0012487|pmid=20824134|pmc=2931698}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, GRN163L inhibited the ''[[in vitro]]'' clonogenic growth of CD138neg Multiple Myeloma Cancer Stem Cells isolated from the bone marrow aspirates of patients with [[multiple myeloma]]. On November 3, 2014, the [[FDA]] removed the full clinical hold on imetelstat and declared the company's clinical development plan as acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/11/03/why-geron-corporation-shares-skyrocketed.aspx|title=Why Geron Corporation Shares Skyrocketed|date=November 3, 2014 |author=Alex Planes|work=The Motley Fool}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:In November 2014 Geron entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement with [[Johnson and Johnson]]'s biotech division ([[Janssen Biotech]]) to develop and commercialize GRN163L.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ir.geron.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=67323&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1989673|title=Geron Announces Global Strategic Collaboration with Janssen to Develop and Commercialize Imetelstat |website=Investor Relations: Press Release|publisher=Geron|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two active Phase 2 trials for GRN163L are scheduled for completion in 2019 and 2022, one for [[Myelofibrosis]] and the other for [[Myelodysplastic Syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=&amp;term=grn163l&amp;cntry=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;dist=|title=Search of: grn163l - List Results - ClinicalTrials.gov|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A trial of GRNVAC1, a telomerase vaccine being used on patients with [[prostate cancer]] was carried out at [[Duke University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harley|first1=Calvin B.|title=Telomerase and cancer therapeutics|journal=Nature Reviews Cancer|date=March 2008|volume=8|issue=3|pages=167–179|doi=10.1038/nrc2275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geron's progress with telomerase vaccines attracted a modest monetary investment in 2005 from [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2005/09/12/daily2.html | title=Geron plans stock offering, Merck buying $18M in shares | date=12 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*GRN1005, an LRP-directed conjugate of [[paclitaxel]], was in phase II clinical trials for brain cancer but discontinued based on preliminary results in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geron Scraps GRN1005, Cuts Jobs|url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/88169/geron-scraps-grn1005-cuts-jobs|website=Zacks Investment Research|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Geron exclusively licensed imetelstat to [[Janssen Biotech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fitzhugh|first1=Michael|title='New chapter' as Geron lands potential $935M imetelstat deal with Janssen|url=http://www.bioworld.com/content/new-chapter-geron-lands-potential-935m-imetelstat-deal-janssen-0|work=BioWorld|date=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This partnership was ended by Janssen on Sep 28th, 2018.

===Telomerase activation===

In addition to testing drug candidates that exploit cancer cell's dependence on telomerase, Geron is researching the possible applications of activating the enzyme in normal cells to delay cellular [[senescence]].  The company is in the early stages of developing a telomerase based treatment for [[HIV]] called TAT0002, which is the [[saponin]] [[cycloastragenol]] in Chinese herb [[Astragalus propinquus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/181/10/7400 TAT2 (cycloastragenol, CAS Registry no. 84605-18-5)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Geron has granted a license to Telomerase Activation Sciences to sell [[TA-65]], the telomerase activator agent also derived from [[astragalus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borrell|first1=Brendan|title=Lawsuit challenges anti-ageing claims|url=http://www.nature.com/news/lawsuit-challenges-anti-ageing-claims-1.11090|work=Nature|date=2 August 2012|pages=18–18|doi=10.1038/488018a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010 Intertek/AAC Labs, an ISO 17025 internationally recognized lab, found the largest component of TA-65 to be Cycloastragenol.&lt;ref&gt;American Analytical Chemistry Laboratories Analysis Document #100710-236 of [http://www.CycloAstragenol.com/ TA-65]&lt;/ref&gt;

Geron originally investigated telomerase as a means of understanding and modifying human aging. However, Geron has ceased aging research of any kind.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Stem cell therapies===

On January 23, 2009, Geron received [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval to begin [[Clinical trial#Phase I|Phase I]] testing of GRNOPC1 in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/technology/2006/07/21/stem-cell-research-cz_kd_0721stemcell.html |work=Forbes |title=Despite Bush Veto, Stem Cell Research Abounds - Forbes.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204143010/http://www.forbes.com/technology/2006/07/21/stem-cell-research-cz_kd_0721stemcell.html |archivedate=February 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  GRNOPC1 is an embryonic stem cell based drug that is designed to treat specific forms of [[spinal cord injury]] through [[remyelination]] of damaged [[axon]]s.  This trial does not involve direct use of stem cells however, as GRNOPC1 is composed of [[oligodendrocyte]] progenitor cells derived from embryonic stem cell lines. Studies have shown significant restoration of mobility in animals with spinal injuries that received cells.&lt;ref name="pmid15888645"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Keirstead HS, Nistor G, Bernal G, etal |title=Human embryonic stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cell transplants remyelinate and restore locomotion after spinal cord injury |journal=J.

Geron also has several other embryonic [[stem cell treatments]] that are still in the preclinical phase, including GRNCM1, a treatment for [[heart disease]], and GRNIC1, a treatment for [[diabetes]].  In tests with diabetic mice, 80% of the mice given GRNIC1 were still alive in 50 days while the entire control group, which was given no treatment, perished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genengnews.com/news/bnitem.aspx?name=3153413 News: Geron Presents New Data That Document Progress in Development of Therapeutic Products from Human Embryonic Stem Cells. Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News - Biotechnology from Bench to Business]&lt;/ref&gt;

Geron sold its human stem cell research assets to [[Asterias]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geron Announces Record Date for Distribution of Asterias Series A Common Stock|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/geron-announces-record-date-distribution-113101473.html|website=Yahoo Finance|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====GRNOPC1====
{{main article|Human embryonic stem cells clinical trials#Geron Spinal Cord Injury Trial}}

As of October 2010 and November 2010, One of Geron's most highly publicized trial therapy products has been GRNOPC1, a stem cell therapy designed to heal severe spinal cord injuries.  The cells in the GRNOPC1 therapy have been coaxed into becoming early [[myelinated]] [[glial cells]], a type of cell that insulates [[nerve cells]].  For every GRNOPC1 cell that is injected in the patient, they become six to 10 cells in a few months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pagingdrgupta.blogs.cnn.com/2010/10/11/first-human-injected-in-human-embryonic-stem-cell-trial/?replytocom=86296 CNN Rachel Meade Reports (October 13, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;
In Oct 2011 updated results on 4 patients were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scimitarequity.com/blog/2011/10/20/geron-gern-updates-clinical-data-from-grnopc1-spinal-cord-injury-trial/ |title=Geron (GERN) updates Clinical Data from GRNOPC1 Spinal Cord Injury Trial |date=20 Oct 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023052613/http://www.scimitarequity.com/blog/2011/10/20/geron-gern-updates-clinical-data-from-grnopc1-spinal-cord-injury-trial/ |archivedate=2011-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was discontinued in Nov 2011.

In early 2013 [[BioTime]], whose [[CEO]] is Geron founder [[Michael D. West]], acquired 400 patents and other intellectual property related to embryonic stem cells from Geron &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Geron's Stem Cell Program Sold|url= http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/37749/title/Geron-s-Stem-Cell-Program-Sold/ |work= The Scientist |date= October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= BioTime acquires stem cell assets from Geron, raises $10 million|url= http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/biotech/2013/01/biotime-acquires-stem-cell-assets-geron.html |work= San Francisco Business Times |date= January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later went on to restart the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Funding windfall rescues abandoned stem-cell trial|url= http://www.nature.com/news/funding-windfall-rescues-abandoned-stem-cell-trial-1.15350 |work= Nature |date= June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patent issues==
Geron Corporation initially held exclusive rights to three cell types derived from [[embryonic stem cell]]s, as the result of paying for the research originally conducted by [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|Dr. James Thomson]] at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Westhoff|first1=Julia|title=WARF, Geron reach settlement|url=http://badgerherald.com/news/2002/01/22/warf_geron_reach_set.php|work=The Badger Herald|date=22 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patents on the other three cell types are owned by the [[Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation]] (WARF). WARF and Geron did not charge academics to study human stem cells but did charge commercial users. In 2001 WARF came under public pressure to widen access to human stem-cell technology, and they launched legal action against Geron Corporation to recover some of the previously sold rights. The two sides agreed that Geron would keep the rights to only three cell types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Regalado|first1=Antonio|last2=Hamilton|first2=David P.|title=How a University's Patents May Limit Stem-Cell Research|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115319002102509489|work=Wall Street Journal|date=18 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, a legal challenge was mounted to overturn these patents by [[Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights|The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights]] and the non-profit patent-watchdog [[Public Patent Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kintisch|first1=E.|title=Groups Challenge Key Stem Cell Patents|journal=Science|date=21 July 2006|volume=313|issue=5785|pages=281–281|doi=10.1126/science.313.5785.281|lay-url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2006/07/groups-target-stem-cell-patents|lay-date=18 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contended that two of the patents granted to WARF are invalid because they cover a technique published in 1992 for which a patent had already been granted to an Australian researcher. Another part of the challenge came from the molecular biologist [[Jeanne Loring]] who stated that [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] stem cell pioneer [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|James Thomson]]'s techniques (currently patents held by WARF) are rendered obvious by a 1990 paper and two textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Loring|first1=Jeanne|title=A patent challenge for human embryonic stem cell research|url=http://www.nature.com/stemcells/2007/0711/071108/full/stemcells.2007.113.html|work=Nature Reports Stem Cells|date=8 November 2007|doi=10.1038/stemcells.2007.113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of this legal challenge was particularly relevant to the Geron Corporation as it can only license patents that are upheld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stem Cell Patents Come Under Fire|url=http://www.genetics-and-society.org/newsdisp.asp?id=1039|work=Center for Genetics and Society|agency=Associated Press|date=19 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patents were ultimately upheld when the reexamination concluded in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warf.org/news/news.jsp?news_id=234 WARF press release]&lt;/ref&gt;

As an interim measure, on January 23, 2007 WARF relaxed the stem cell patents, allowing industry-sponsored research at academic and non-profit institutions without a license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Somers|first1=Terri|title=Stem cell scientists shout out hallelujah|url=http://legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20070123/news_1b23stems.html|work=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=23 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; WARF will allow easier and simpler cost free cell transfers among researchers and would not require a license or agreement from California's taxpayer-funded stem cell research program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Group Eases Stem Cell Patent Restrictions After FTCR|url=http://www.pubpat.org/warfstemcelleased.htm|website=PUBPAT|accessdate=5 September 2013|date=23 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
As a participant in the [[stem cell controversy|then-controversial]] stem cell and cloning area, Geron Corporation was asked to testify about its technology before the U.S. Congress.  In 2001, when Congress was attempting to ban all forms of cloning, then Geron [[chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Thomas Okarma]] spoke before Congress to preserve cloning for therapeutic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2001/04/05/0305cloning.html | work=Forbes | title=Geron's Cloning Quandary - Forbes.com | date=April 5, 2001| first=Matthew | last=Herper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_22/b3835716.htm |title=Online Extra: Thomas Okarma: Don't Ban Stem-Cell Research |date=2 June 2003 |work=BusinessWeek |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522210421/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_22/b3835716.htm |archive-date=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=House Hearing, 107th Congress - The Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001 and The Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001 |date=20 June 2001 |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-107hhrg73733/html/CHRG-107hhrg73733.htm |website=U.S. Government Publishing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global strategy''' as defined in business terms is an organization's strategic guide to [[globalization]]. Such a connected world, allows a business’s revenue to not be to be confined by borders. A business can employ a global business strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inwhatlanguage.com/blog/global-business-strategy/|title=Why A Global Business Strategy Is Necessary For Global Domination!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reap the rewards of trading in a worldwide market. 

==Description==
A sound global strategy should address these questions: what must be (versus what is) the extent of market presence in the world's major markets? How to build the necessary global presence? What must be AND (versus what is) the optimal locations around the world for the various value chain activities? How to run global presence into a global competitive advantage? The “International” classification of a global business strategy is employed by companies who may sell in foreign markets, but their primary focus is on their home market. These companies may include international strategies in their business model to increase sales, but they know that their main target consumer is local.   &lt;ref&gt;Vijay Govindarajan and Anil K. Gupta 'The Quest for Global Dominance: Transforming Global Presence into Global Competitive Advantage' Jossey-Bass. (2008). p. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Research==
Academic research on global strategy came during the 1980s, including work by [[Michael Porter]] and Christopher Bartlett &amp; [[Sumantra Ghoshal]]. Among the forces perceived to bring about the globalization of competition were convergences in economic systems and technological change, especially in information technology, that facilitated and required the coordination of a multinational firm's strategy on a worldwide scale.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Porter (ed.) 'Competition in Global Industries' Harvard Business School Press. (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher A 1989"&gt;Christopher A. Bartlett and Sumantra Ghoshal 'Managing across Borders: The Transnational Solution' Harvard Business School Press. (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industries==
A global strategy may be appropriate in industries where firms are faced with strong pressures for cost reduction but with weak pressures for local responsiveness. Therefore, it allows these firms to sell a standardized product worldwide. However, [[fixed cost]]s ([[capital (economics)|capital]] equipment) are substantial. Nevertheless, these firms are able to take advantage of scale economies and [[experience curve effects]], because it is able to mass-produce a standard product, which can be exported (providing that demand is greater than the costs involved).

Global strategies require firms to tightly coordinate their product and pricing strategies across international markets and locations, and therefore firms that pursue a global strategy are typically highly centralized.&lt;ref name="Christopher A 1989"/&gt;

==Aspects==
A global strategy involves thinking in an integrated way about all aspects of business-its suppliers, production sites, markets, and competition. It involves assessing every product or service from the perspective of both domestic and international market standards. It means embedding international perspectives in product formulations at the point of design, not as afterthoughts. It means meeting world standards even before seeking world markets and being world class even in local markets. It means deepening the company's understanding of local and cultural differences in order to become truly global. &lt;ref&gt;Kanter, R. M., &amp; Dretler, T. D. (1998, November). "Global strategy" and its impact on local operations. The Academy of Management Executive, 12 (4), pp. 60-68. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Rinner''' (18 March 1963 – 16 February 2018) was an [[Austria]]n businessman and [[Association football|football]] administrator. Since 7 December 2009 he was the President of the [[Austrian Football Bundesliga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stmv1.orf.at/stories/406059|title=Hans Rinner wird Bundesliga-Präsident|date=2009-11-27|publisher=ORF Steiermark|access-date=2016-08-05|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rinner was also the owner and manager of a refrigeration company.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} From 2007 to 2010 he was president of [[SK Sturm Graz]] and then until 2016, member of the Supervisory Board. Since 2016 he was honorary president of the club.

== Biography ==
After school Rinner completed an apprenticeship as an electrician. He then completed his high school diploma at night school, specializing in the field of refrigeration. Rinner was managing director of his company in [[Frauental an der Laßnitz]].

=== Football ===
Rinner was elected on 2 November 2006 as vice president of the football club SK Sturm Graz. On 18 January 2007 he was elected president of the club. He was the successor of [[Hans Fedl]]. During his tenure, the club was able to complete a bankruptcy procedure successfully. On 25 May 2010, Rinner stepped down as President during a board meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sturm12.at/2010/05/25/hans-rinner-zurueckgetreten/|title=Hans Rinner zurückgetreten|date=2010-05-25|publisher=Sturm12|access-date=2016-08-05|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, Rinner was also vice president of the Austrian Bundesliga, which includes the [[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] and [[Austrian Football First League|First League]]. On 27 November 2009, the club heads of the Bundesliga agreed on Rinner becoming the new Bundesliga president. He was the successor of [[Martin Pucher]]. The official election took place on 7 December 2009, and as expected, the choice of Hans Rinner won with 75 of 80 votes.

At the General Assembly of the SK Sturm Graz on 18 January 2016, Rinner was appointed honorary president of the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sksturm.at/verein/management/funktionaere/|title=Ehrenpräsidenten|publisher=SK Sturm Graz|access-date=2016-08-05|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5651">In the [[United Kingdom]], only an authorised or licensed '''Insolvency Practitioner''' (usually abbreviated to '''IP''') may be appointed in relation to formal [[insolvency]] procedures.

Quite often IPs have an [[accountant|accountancy]] background.  A few active practitioners are [[lawyer]]s, but it is not necessary to be qualified as either, as since 1986 there has been a direct entry route to the profession.

==Insolvency is a regulated profession==

In the UK, only a licensed Insolvency Practitioner (referred to as IP) can be appointed in relation to formal insolvency procedures for individuals and businesses. Insolvency Practitioners are licensed to advise on, and undertake appointments in, all formal insolvency procedures. In the UK Insolvency Practitioners are subject to oversight and inspection by their recognised professional body.
Insolvency is a regulated profession under the [[Insolvency Act 1986]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insolv ency Act 1986 1986 CHAPTER 45|url=http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/insolvencyprofessionandlegislation/legislation/uk/insolvencyact.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110709051253/http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/insolvencyprofessionandlegislation/legislation/uk/insolvencyact.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 July 2011|publisher=Thomson Reuters (Le g al) Limited|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and anyone who wishes to practise as an IP needs to pass the [[JIEB exams]]; a set of three examination papers set by the Joint Insolvency Examination Board (JIEB). The exams are held once a year, usually in November, and each last 3.5 hours. Once the exams have been passed, it is necessary to meet the authorising body's insolvency experience requirements.

An '''intelligence engine''' is a type of [[enterprise information management]] that combines [[Business rule management system|business rule management]], [[predictive analytics|predictive]], and [[prescriptive analytics]] to form a unified information-access platform that provides real-time intelligence through [[Web search engine|search technologies]], [[Dashboard (management information systems)|dashboards]] and/or existing business infrastructure.  Intelligence Engines are process and/or business problem specific, resulting in industry and/or function-specific marketing trademarks associated with them.  They can be differentiated from [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) software in that intelligence engines include organization-level business rules and proactive [[decision management]] functionality.

==History==
The first intelligence engine application appears to have been introduced in 2001 by [[Sonus Networks|Sonus Networks, Inc.]] in their patent US6961334 B1.&lt;ref name="sonus"&gt;{{cite patent | country = US | number = 6961334 | status = patent | title = Intelligence engine | gdate = 2005-11-01 | invent1 = Kaczmarczyk, Casimer M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied to the field of telecommunications systems, the intelligence engine was composed of a database queried by a data distributor layer, received by a telephony management layer and acted upon by a facility management command &amp; control layer.&lt;ref name="sonus" /&gt; This combined standalone business intelligence tools like a [[data warehouse]], reporting and querying software and a [[decision support system]].

The concept was reinforced in 2002 in patent application US20030236689 A1&lt;ref name="2002patent"&gt;{{cite patent | country = US | number = 20030236689 | status = application | title = Analyzing decision points in business processes | pubdate = 2003-12-25 | invent1 = Casati, Fabio | invent2 = Sayal, Mehmet | invent3 = Guadalupe Castellanos, Maria | invent4 = Gunopulos, Dimitrios | url = https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=US&amp;NR=2003236689&amp;KC=A1&amp;FT=E&amp;locale=en_EP}}&lt;/ref&gt; which applied predictive quantitative models to data and used rules to correlate context data at different stages of the business process with business process outcomes to be presented to end users.&lt;ref name="2002patent" /&gt;

[[LogRhythm|LogRhythm Inc.]] advanced the concept in 2010 by adding event managers to the end of the intelligence engine's process to determine reporting, remediation and other outcomes.&lt;ref name="LogRhythm"&gt;{{cite patent | country = US | number = 2012131185 | status = application | title = Advanced Intelligence Engine | pubdate = 2012-05-24 | invent1 = Petersen , Chris | invent2 = Villella, Phillip | invent3 = Aisa, Brad | url = https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=US&amp;NR=2012131185A1&amp;KC=A1&amp;FT=D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, professional service company [[KPMG]] continued to advance the concept by commercializing intelligence engines with the introduction of Third Party Intelligence, which is differentiated from past intelligence engines in its increased use of embedded intellectual property, diversity of global data inputs and focus on predictive analytics to mitigate risk and yield cost savings.&lt;ref name="CIOReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cioreview.com/news/kmpg-launches-third-party-intelligence-intelligence-engine-to-anticipate-thirdparty-disruptions-nid-14407-cid-78.html |title=KMPG Launches Third Party Intelligence: Intelligence Engine to Anticipate Third-party Disruptions|accessdate=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traits==
As a system that combines human intelligence, data inputs, automated decision-making and unified information access, intelligence engines are an advancement in business intelligence tools because they:

'''Long Island City''' ('''LIC''') is a residential and commercial neighborhood located on the extreme western tip of [[Queens]], [[New York City]], at the western edge of [[Long Island]].  It is bordered by [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]] to the north; the [[East River]] to the west; Hazen Street, 49th Street, and [[Calvary Cemetery (Queens, New York)|New Calvary Cemetery]] in [[Sunnyside, Queens|Sunnyside]] to the east; and [[Newtown Creek]]—which separates Queens from [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]]—to the south.  The area is part of [[Queens Community Board 1]] to the north and [[Queens Community Board 2]] to the south.

Incorporated as a separate city in 1870, Long Island City was originally the seat of government of the [[Newtown, Queens|Town of Newtown]], before becoming part of New York City in 1898.  Starting in the early 21st century, Long Island City became known for its rapid and ongoing residential growth and [[gentrification]], its waterfront parks, and its thriving arts community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Most Livable Neighborhoods in New York |first=Nate |last=Silver |url=http://nymag.com/realestate/neighborhoods/2010/65374/index8.html |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=April 11, 2010 |accessdate=July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area has among the highest concentration of art galleries, art institutions, and studio space of any neighborhood in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://queens.about.com/od/thingtodo/ss/lic_art.htm |title=Long Island City Art Tour |first=John |last=Roleke |work=[[About.com]] |accessdate=July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long Island City is the eastern terminus of the [[Queensboro Bridge]], also known as the ''59th Street Bridge'', which is the only non-tolled automotive route connecting Queens and [[Manhattan]]. Northwest of the bridge are the [[Queensbridge Houses]], a development of the [[New York City Housing Authority]] and the largest public housing complex in the [[Western Hemisphere]].

Long Island City was formerly a city of its own, created in 1870 from the merger of the [[Village (New York)|Village]] of [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]] and the hamlets of [[Ravenswood, Queens|Ravenswood]], [[Hunters Point, Queens|Hunters Point]], [[Blissville, Queens|Blissville]], [[Sunnyside, Queens|Sunnyside]], [[Dutch Kills]], Steinway, Bowery Bay and Middleton in the Town of Newtown.&lt;ref name= new&gt;"[http://search.proquest.com/docview/92554597/ The New Long Island City—Provisions of the Proposed Charter]".

February 20, 1870. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; At time of incorporation, Long Island City had between 12,000 and 15,000 residents.&lt;ref name= new/&gt; Its charter provided for an elected mayor and a ten-member Board of Alderman with two representing each of the city's five wards.&lt;ref name= new/&gt; City ordinances could be passed by a majority vote of the Board of Aldermen and the mayor's signature.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://search.proquest.com/docview/92501949/ Long Island City—Ordinances of the Common Council]". ''The New York Times''. August 6, 1870. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Long Island City held its first election on July 5, 1870.&lt;ref name= election&gt;"[http://search.proquest.com/docview/92560180/ The Election in Long Island City]". ''The New York Times''. July 6, 1870. p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Residents elected A.D. Delmars the first mayor; Delmars ran as both a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].&lt;ref name= election/&gt; The first elected Board of Aldermen was H. Rudolph and Patrick Lonirgan (Ward 1); Francis McNena and William E. Bragaw (Ward 2); George Hunter and Mr. Williams (Third Ward); James R. Bennett and John Wegart (Ward Four); and E.M. Hartshort and William Carlin (Fifth Ward).&lt;ref name= election/&gt; The mayor and the aldermen were inaugurated on July 18, 1870.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://search.proquest.com/docview/93070277/ Inauguration of the Long Island City Officers—Message of the Mayor]". ''The New York Times''. July 19, 1870. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880s, Mayor De Bevoise nearly bankrupted the Long Island City government by [[embezzlement]], of which he was convicted.&lt;ref name= unhappy&gt;"[http://search.proquest.com/docview/94193149/ Unhappy Long Island City]". ''The New York Times''. February 18, 1884. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Many dissatisfied residents of Astoria circulated a petition to ask the New York State Legislature to allow it to secede from Long Island City and reincorporate as the Village of Astoria, as it existed prior to the incorporation of Long Island City, in 1884.&lt;ref name= unhappy/&gt; The petition was ultimately dropped by the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://search.proquest.com/docview/94257639/ Long Island]". ''The New York Times''. March 8, 1884. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Long Island City continued to exist as an incorporated city until 1898, when all of Queens was annexed to New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Greater Astoria Historical Society |author2=Jackson, Thomas |author3=Melnick, Richard |authorlink=Greater Astoria Historical Society |title=Long Island City |series=Images of America |year=2004 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |location=Charleston, SC |isbn=0-7385-3666-0 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last mayor of Long Island City was an Irish-American named [[Patrick Gleason (politician)|Patrick Jerome "Battle-Axe" Gleason]].

The Common Council of Long Island City in 1873 adopted the [[coat of arms]] as "emblematical of the varied interest represented by Long Island City." It was designed by George H. Williams, of [[Ravenswood, Queens|Ravenswood]]. The overall composition was inspired by New York City's coat of arms. The shield is rich in historic allusion, including Native American, Dutch, and English symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astorialic.org/topics/coatofarms_p.php |title=History Topics: LIC Coat of Arms |work=[[Greater Astoria Historical Society]] |accessdate=July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, Long Island City became part of New York City.

===After incorporation into New York City===

The city surrendered its independence in 1898 to become part of the [[City of Greater New York]]. However, Long Island City survives as [[ZIP code]] 11101 and [[ZIP code prefix]] 111 (with its own main post office) and was formerly a [[sectional center facility]] (SCF). Since 1985, the [[Greater Astoria Historical Society]], a [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit cultural and historical organization]], has been preserving the past and promoting the future of the neighborhoods that are part of historic Long Island City.

Through the 1930s, numerous subway tunnels, the [[Queens-Midtown Tunnel]], and the [[Queensboro Bridge]] were built to connect the neighborhood to Manhattan. By the 1970s, the factories in Long Island City were being abandoned. In 1981, Queens West on the west side of Long Island City was developed to revitalize the area.

In 2001, the neighborhood was rezoned from an industrial neighborhood to a residential neighborhood, and the area underwent [[gentrification]], with developments such as [[Hunter's Point South]] being built in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queenswestvillager.com/about/detail/history_of_long_island_city |title=Queens West Villager |publisher=Queens West Villager |accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there has been substantial commercial and residential growth in Long Island City, with 41 new residential apartment buildings being built just between 2010 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Curbed | title=Long Island City’s unstoppable development boom, mapped | website=Curbed NY | date=June 28, 2017 | url=https://ny.curbed.com/maps/long-island-city-development-boom-construction-map | access-date=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-HQ2forQueens-2018"/&gt; In 2006, a resident of nearby [[Woodside, Queens|Woodside]], Hiroyuki Takenaga, proposed establishing a [[Japantown]] in Long Island City.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, John Freeman.

Long Island City was once home to many factories and bakeries, some of which are finding new uses. The former Silvercup bakery is now home to [[Silvercup Studios]], which has produced notable works such as [[NBC]]'s ''[[30 Rock]]'' and [[HBO]]'s ''[[Sex and the City]]''. The Silvercup sign is visible from the [[IRT Flushing Line]] and [[BMT Astoria Line]] trains going into and out of [[Queensboro Plaza (New York City Subway)|Queensboro Plaza]] ({{NYCS trains|Queensboro Plaza}}). The former Sunshine Bakery is now one of the buildings which houses [[LaGuardia Community College]]. Other buildings on the campus originally served as the location of the Ford Instrument Company, which was at one time a major producer of precision machines and devices.  Artist [[Isamu Noguchi]] converted a photo-engraving plant into a workshop; the site is now the [[Noguchi Museum]], a space dedicated to his work.

The [[Standard Motor Products]] headquarters, a manufacturing site producing items like distributor caps, was once located in the industrial neighborhood of Long Island City until purchased by Acuman Partners in 2008 for $40M. The Standard Motor Products Building was put on the market by Acuman in 2014 and acquired by [[RXR Realty, LLC]] for $110M. The former factory built in 1919 now houses [[the Jim Henson Company]], [[Society Awards]], and a commercial rooftop farm run by [[Brooklyn Grange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zlomek|first1=Erin|title=Redeveloping New York Factories into Small Business Hubs|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-08-21/acumen-capital-redevelops-old-factories-into-small-business-hubs|website=Bloomberg BusinessWeek|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-rise housing is being built on a former Pepsi-Cola site on the East River. From June 2002 to September 2004, the former [[Swingline]] Staplers plant was the temporary headquarters of the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. Other former factories in Long Island City include [[Fisher Electronics]] and [[Chiclets]] Gum. Long Island City's turn-of-the-century district of residential towers, called Queens West, is located along the East River, just north of the LIRR's [[Long Island City (LIRR station)|Long Island City]] Station. Redevelopment in Queens West reflects the intent to have the area as a major residential area in New York City, with its high-rise residences very close to public transportation, making it convenient for commuters to travel to Manhattan by ferry or subway. The first tower, the 42-floor Citylights, opened in 1998 with an elementary school at the base. Others have been completed since then and more are being planned or under construction.

Today, the most prominent structure, other than Queensboro Bridge, is the community's green skyscraper, the {{convert|658|ft|m|adj=on}} [[One Court Square|Citicorp Building]] built in 1989 on [[Long Island City Courthouse Complex|Courthouse Square]]. It is the tallest building on [[Long Island]] and in any of the New York City boroughs outside Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=116174 |title=Citicorp Building |work=[[Emporis]] |accessdate=January 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socioeconomic diversity is very visible in Long Island City; the [[Queensbridge, Queens|Queensbridge Houses]] are composed of over 3,000 units, making it the largest public housing complex in North America.

Long Island City is currently home to the largest [[fortune cookie]] factory in the United States, owned by [[Wonton Foods]] and producing four million fortune cookies a day.

===Dutch Kills===
Dutch Kills was a [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]], named for its navigable tributary of Newtown Creek, that occupied what today is centrally [[Queensboro Plaza (New York City Subway)|Queensboro Plaza]]. Dutch Kills was an important road hub during the [[American Revolutionary War]], and the site of a British Army garrison from 1776 to 1783. The area supported farms during the 19th century. The canalization of Newtown Creek and the Kills at the end of the 19th century intensified industrial development of the area, which prospered until the middle of the 20th century.

[[File:Título de la Maestría.JPG|thumb|Example of a diploma from [[Harvard University]] conferring the MPA degree. It belongs to [[Felipe Calderón]], former president of Mexico.]]

The '''Master of Public Administration''' ('''M.P.Adm.''', '''M.P.A.''', or '''MPA''') is a professional graduate degree in [[public administration]], similar to the [[Master of Business Administration]] but with an emphasis on the issues of governance.

==Overview==
The MPA program is a [[professional degree]] and a [[graduate degree]] for the public sector and it prepares individuals to serve as managers, executives and policy analysts in the executive arm of local, state/provincial, and federal/national government, and increasingly in [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) and [[nonprofit]] sectors; it places a focus on the systematic investigation of executive organization and management. Instruction includes the roles, development, and principles of public administration; [[public policy]] management and implementation.

Through its history, the MPA degree has become more interdisciplinary by drawing from fields such as economics, sociology, law, anthropology, political science, and regional planning in order to equip MPA graduates with skills and knowledge covering a broad range of topics and disciplines relevant to the public sector. A core curriculum of a typical MPA program usually includes courses on [[microeconomics]], [[public finance]], research methods, statistics, [[policy analysis]], [[managerial accounting]], ethics, [[public management]], [[geographic information system]]s (GIS), and program evaluation. MPA students may focus their studies on public sector fields such as [[urban planning]], [[emergency management]], [[transportation]], health care (especially [[public health]]), [[economic development]], [[community development]], [[non-profit]] management, [[environmental policy]], [[cultural policy]], and [[criminal justice]].

MPA graduates currently serve in some important positions within the public sector including Prime Minister of Singapore [[Lee Hsien Loong]], former UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-Moon]], former [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Director]] [[David Petraeus]], former president of Liberia [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]], former president of Mexico [[Felipe Calderón]], Foreign Minister of Serbia [[Vuk Jeremić]], Chairman of the [[World Toilet Organization]] [[Jack Sim]], former New York City Police Commissioner [[Raymond Kelly]], former [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]] [[Kathleen Sebelius]], former Treasurer of Australia [[Wayne Swan]]. Other notable MPA graduates include [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and pilot [[Chesley Sullenberger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.study.eu/article/15-notable-graduates-from-mpa-and-mpp-programmes|title=15 notable graduates from MPA and MPP programmes|access-date=2018-02-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Master of Public Administration can be acquired at various institutions. See ''[[List of public administration schools|List of schools offering MPA degrees.]]''

'''Mykola Mykolayovych Melnyk''' ({{lang-uk|Микола Миколайович Мельник}}; December 17, 1953 - July 26, 2013), also known as '''Nikolai Melnik''' was a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] (previously [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]) [[Aviator|pilot]] and [[Liquidator (Chernobyl)|liquidator hero]] renowned for his high-risk [[helicopter]] mission on the dangerously-[[radioactive contamination|radioactive]] [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] building immediately after the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]].

For this operation, he was awarded the title of [[Hero of the Soviet Union]],&lt;ref name=sptimes/&gt; and the Igor I. Sikorsky Award for Humanitarian Service.

==Early life==
Nikolai Melnik was born on December 17, 1953 and grew up in the town of [[Stavyshche]] in the [[Kyiv Oblast]] of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], which is now [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="Remebrance Book"/&gt; Upon his school graduation, Melnyk worked as a sports coach, and later as a [[Telephone|telephone station]] technician in Stavyshche, later moving to [[Zaporizhia]] for a construction job.&lt;ref name="poshtar obituary"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://dt.ua/columnists/zhittya-zaradi-priydeshnih-pokolin-pam-yati-tovarisha-126347_.html | title=Життя заради прийдешніх поколінь (пам'яті товариша) | work=[[Dzerkalo Tyzhnia]] | date=2013-08-07 | accessdate=24 August 2013 | author=Poshtar, Petro | location=Kiev}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972-74 he served his [[conscription|conscript service]] in the [[Soviet Armed Forces]].

==Pilot career==
In 1979 Melnyk graduated from the Civil Aviation Pilot School (KLUGA) in [[Kremenchuk]] and began working as a civilian helicopter pilot in different cities. Later he continued his education at the [[Kremenchuk University|Kremenchuk Department of the Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute]] and the Civil Aviation [[Postgraduate education|Academy]] in [[Leningrad]]. After graduation from the special [[test pilot]] school in 1984, Melnyk worked as a test pilot, particularly for the [[Kamov|Kamov helicopter design bureau]] in [[Feodosiya]].&lt;ref name="Remebrance Book"&gt;МЕЛЬНИК, Микола Миколайович, [http://memory.chornobylmuseum.kiev.ua/index.php "Remembrance Book"] {{uk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oboronprom.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oboronprom.ru/news/vertolet-ka-32-v-nebe-pyati-kontinentov |title= ВЕРТОЛЕТ КА-32 - В НЕБЕ ПЯТИ КОНТИНЕНТОВ (The Ka-32 in the Sky, Five Continents) |date=13 January 2006 |publisher=Oboronprom Corporation|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chernobyl Liquidator mission==
After the April 1986 Chernobyl disaster, Melnyk was directed to work in the cleanup operations. Lethal levels of [[radiation]] created after the Reactor #4 fire prevented ground [[Liquidator (Chernobyl)|liquidator teams]] from most operations on the roof of the power plant building. However, helicopters could reach and leave the area above the building within seconds, thus inflicting less health damage to the personnel on board. They were employed to cover building openings with [[sandbag]]s and [[lead]] slabs, install necessary equipment, commence aerial [[photography]] and atmospheric [[radioactive contamination]] [[Radiation monitoring|monitoring]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iss-atom.ru/book-4/glav-1-13.htm БОЕВЫЕ ДЕЙСТВИЯ В "МИРНОМ" НЕБЕ] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416214924/http://www.iss-atom.ru/book-4/glav-1-13.htm |date=2013-04-16 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Воздушная битва при Чернобыле"&gt;[http://www.xliby.ru/transport_i_aviacija/aviacija_i_vremja_2011_03/p5.php Воздушная битва при Чернобыле (Aerial Battle of Chernobyl)] in "Aviatsiya i Vremia" magazine, 2011, #2; {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melnyk, among others, was assigned to such missions as an experienced civilian helicopter pilot. He flew 46 [[sortie]]s over the reactor building, for a combined total duration of 52 hours.&lt;ref name="Remebrance Book"/&gt; The most important of those sorties was the so-called "Operation Igla" (Operation Needle), the June 19, 1986 installation of a giant 18-meter-long [[Ionizing radiation|radiation]] probe on top of the building by means of a precision [[airdrop|drop]] from the Kamov&lt;ref&gt;Sources name either [[Kamov Ka-27]] or [[Kamov Ka-32]] as the model of exact helicopter.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coaxial rotors|coaxial rotor helicopter]].&lt;ref name="Воздушная битва при Чернобыле"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.v-chernobyl.ru/Doroga_na_Pripyat/Operaciya_Igla/index.html Операция «Игла»] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007000129/http://www.v-chernobyl.ru/Doroga_na_Pripyat/Operaciya_Igla/index.html |date=2013-10-07 }} {{ru icon}}, [http://www.v-chernobyl.ru/Doroga_na_Pripyat/Rabota_Melnika/index.html Работа Мельника] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007001337/http://www.v-chernobyl.ru/Doroga_na_Pripyat/Rabota_Melnika/index.html |date=2013-10-07 }} {{ru icon}}, [http://www.pravda.ru/video/science/502.html Страсти по Чернобылю] {{ru icon}}, Губарев, В.

When Melnyk successfully completed the operation during a training exercise in [[Moscow]], the observers broke into applause.&lt;ref name=Passion/&gt; Melnyk did not know the purpose of the training, however, until several days later when he flew to [[Kiev]] to undertake the actual mission.&lt;ref name=sptimes/&gt; The first attempt to insert the "needle" into the actual reactor was foiled by a frozen crust above the target; Melnyk succeeded on the third try.&lt;ref name=Passion&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvtornik.ru/articles/2011/02/189/2803.html | title=Губарев В.

According to the "Remembrance Book" by the [[Ukrainian National Chornobyl Museum|Chornobyl Museum]], Melnyk participated in the 'liquidator' operations on site of the disaster from May 20, 1986 until September 9, 1986.&lt;ref name="Remebrance Book"/&gt; &lt;!-- He received an estimated radiation dose of 160.&lt;ref name="Remebrance Book"/&gt; NEED UNITS. --&gt; In 1994, he underwent two surgeries related to health problems attributed to his radiation exposure.&lt;ref name=sptimes/&gt;

==Subsequent aviation career and death==
Upon return from Chernobyl mission, Melnyk continued his work as a test pilot at the Kamov helicopter testing center in Feodosiya until 1992.&lt;ref name="poshtar obituary"/&gt; In independent Ukraine, the facility was reorganized as a separate Feodosiya Kamov Research and Production Enterprise "Vertolit" (Феодосійське науково-виробниче об'єднання "Вертоліт" імені Камова).&lt;ref name="Remebrance Book"/&gt;

Some time after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], Melnyk co-founded a [[cargo airline]] in [[Kiev]]. The company operated [[Antonov An-24]] airplanes and [[Kamov]] helicopters as a subcontractor for [[DHL Express|DHL]] and [[United Parcel Service]]. However, he gradually became disappointed with the business, citing lack of sustainable demand for his helicopter specialization.&lt;ref name=sptimes/&gt;

In 1995, [[Spain|Spanish]] airline [[Helicopteros del Sureste]] approached Melnyk for help with purchase of Soviet-made helicopters. Melnyk used the opportunity to move to [[Alicante]] (Spain), where he became contracted as a pilot and instructor specializing in Soviet-designed helicopters with the Helicopteros del Sureste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviaport.ru/digest/2005/04/25/90372.html Летчик-Герой Чернобыля ведет Ка-32 в Испанию] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He trained at least 25 local pilots and also has worked in aerial firefighting. As of 2006, Melnyk had 13,400 recorded flight hours.&lt;ref name=sptimes/&gt;&lt;ref name="oboronprom.ru"/&gt;

According to a Ukrainian regional newspaper, Mykola Melnyk died in Spain on  July 26, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.telegraf.in.ua/kremenchug/2013/07/29/v-ispanii-umer-geroy-sssr-letchik-ispytatel-iz-kremenchuga-nikolay-melnik_10030914.html|script-title=ru:В Испании умер Герой СССР, летчик-испытатель из Кременчуга Николай Мельник| date=29 July 2013| location=[[Kremenchuk]]| accessdate=August 2013|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition and awards==

===Soviet awards===
Melnyk was awarded as a [[Hero of the Soviet Union]],&lt;ref name=sptimes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=3713|title=Former Chernobyl Pilot Soars Above His Obstacles|date=31 May 2005|work=[[The St. Petersburg Times|St Petersburg Times]]|accessdate=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oboronprom.ru"/&gt; by Decree of the Presidium of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] issued on October 6, 1987 for his "courage, heroism and self-sacrifice displayed during liquidation of the Chernobyl NPP accident consequences". Later he was also decorated with the Soviet [[Order of Lenin]] for the same deeds.

===International awards===
In 1990, as part of its "[[Salute to Excellence]]" awards program, the [[Helicopter Association International]] honored Melnyk (as ''Nikolai Melnik'') with its [[Igor I. Sikorsky]] Award for Humanitarian Service. The Sikorsky award is presented annually to one or more persons "who best demonstrate(s) the value of civil rotorcraft to society by saving lives, protecting property, and aiding those 
in distress". The award to Melnyk recognized his efforts as a Chernobyl 'liquidator'. The award committee specified that Melnyk was recognized as a representative of "all the valiant aircrews who participated in relief efforts following the Chernobyl nuclear power station accident".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://helicopterannual.org/portals/27/pdf/ann_p6c4.pdf|title="Salute to Excellence" Awards|work="Helicopter Annual'' magazine|year=2009|accessdate=5 October 2013|page=370|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006220054/http://helicopterannual.org/portals/27/pdf/ann_p6c4.pdf|archivedate=6 October 2013|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nikolaos Koklonis''' is a Greek entrepreneur and businessman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tff.gr/gossip/arthro/gnostoi_ellines_glitosan_para_trixa_to_makeleio_tou_reina_stin_konstantinoupoli-130702496/  Γνωστοί Έλληνες γλίτωσαν παρά τρίχα το μακελειό του Reina στην Κωνσταντινούπολη]&lt;/ref&gt; He is most known for being the founder of AirFastTickets and YoTrip.

== Career ==
After completing Business Administration from [[Athens University of Economics and Business]] in 2002, Koklonis worked as a risk manager at [[Société Générale]] for several years. In 2009, he had to book a plane ticket to [[Berlin]], which he found very difficult and frustrating. On his way back to [[Greece]] from the trip, he began planning on launching an online travel agency. Soon afterwards, he founded AirFastTickets with an initial capital of  €100,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140123006267/en/AirFastTickets-Offers-Justin-Bieber-Flight  AirFastTickets Offers Justin Bieber Flight out of US]&lt;/ref&gt; The company bought tickets in bulk from scheduled flights and then sold the tickets at discounted prices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eturbonews.com/28370/airfastticketscom-greek-company-shows-right-way  Airfasttickets.com, a Greek company shows the right way]&lt;/ref&gt; AirFastTickets partnered with Groupon, which allowed it to sell a huge quantity of tickets with low marketing costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emea.gr/nikos-koklonis-interview/493115/493115/ Νίκος Κοκλώνης: "Η άνοδος και η πτώση του 'Bαρώνου'"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company opened its [[London]] office in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argophilia.com/news/airfasttickets-opens-london/25369/  Airfasttickets Opens London Office]&lt;/ref&gt; and its office in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/03/28/airfast-gay-themed-ad-upsets-many/#sthash.lmGbUZ9x.dpuf AirFast Gay-Themed Ad Upsets Many]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the extremely low prices the company offered for tickets, many Greek electronic travel agencies filed lawsuits against AirFastTickets for unfair competition practices. In 2013, the company was awarded for the most rapidly developed SME by the Athens Chamber of Commerce and Industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/07/02/airfasttickets-greece-uk-usa/#sthash.fWbEQWCE.dpuf The Curious Case of Airfasttickets]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piraeuspress.gr/piraeus/dimos-peiraia/23179/dynamiko-come-back-sthn-ellhnikh-agora-apo-ton-mr-airfasttickets-niko-koklwnh  Δυναμικό come back στην ελληνική αγορά από τον Mr Airfasttickets Νίκο Κοκλώνη!]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the company was in the news for offering [[Justin Bieber]] free tickets to travel anywhere outside the US due to Bieber's issues with the US authorities including a DUI.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54649">[[File:Nursing home corridor.JPG|thumb|Nursing shortage is a problem in several districts of [[Norway]]. This nurse is employed at a [[nursing home]].]]
'''Nursing shortage''' refers to a situation where the demand for [[nurse|nursing professionals]], such as [[Registered Nurse]]s (RNs), exceeds the supply—locally (e.g., within a [[health care provider|health care facility]]), nationally or globally. It can be measured, for instance, when the nurse-to-[[patient]] ratio, the nurse-to-population ratio, or the number of [[Job (role)|job openings]] necessitates a higher number of nurses than currently available. This situation is observed in developed and developing nations around the world.

Nursing shortage is not necessarily due to a lack of supply of trained nurses. In some cases, perceived shortages occur simultaneously with increased admission rates of students into [[nursing school]]s. Potential factors include lack of adequate staffing ratios in [[hospital]]s and other health care facilities, lack of placement programs for newly trained nurses, and inadequate worker retention incentives.&lt;ref&gt;Goulette, C. "Nursing (Job) Shortage. New Grads are finding the Job Hunt Tough." Advance for Nurses. Issue January 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates a shortage of almost 4.3 million nurses, physicians and other [[Health Human Resources|health human resources]] worldwide—reported to be the result of decades of underinvestment in health worker education, training, wages, working environment and management.&lt;ref name="who2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whr/2006|title=The world health report 2006 - working together for health|website=who.int|location= Geneva|year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Nursing shortage is an issue in many countries. To remedy the problem, psychological studies have been completed to ascertain how nurses feel about their [[career]] in the hope that they can determine what is preventing some nurses from keeping the profession as a long-term career. In a study completed by sociologist Bryan Turner, the study found that the most common nursing complaints were: 
* subordination to the medical profession on all matters, even over standardized regulations
* difficult working conditions
A report from the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] identified a few other matters that led to nurse dissatisfaction: 
* constant schedule changes
* work overloads due to high number of patients and paperwork
* shift work
* lack of appreciation by superiors
* lack of provided [[childcare]]
* inadequate pay
Another study found that nurse dissatisfaction stemmed from:
* conflicting expectations from nurses and managers due to regulation of cost
* inability to provide comprehensive nursing care due to work 
* loss of confidence in the health care system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why a career in Nursing?|url=http://www.nursestraining-visa.ru/eng/careersEng.html |accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many jurisdictions, administrative/government [[health policy]] and practice has changed very little in the last decades. Cost-cutting is the priority, patient loads are uncontrolled, and nurses are rarely consulted when recommending [[health care reform]].&lt;ref name="mitchell2003"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12876879 | doi=10.1177/0894318403016003011 | volume=16 | title=Nursing shortage or nursing famine: looking beyond numbers? | author=Mitchell GJ | journal=Nurs Sci Q | pages=219–24 | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major reason nurses plan to leave the field, as stated by the First Consulting Group, is because of working conditions.&lt;ref name="stoneetal2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stone |first1=P. W. |last2=Clarke |first2=S. |last3=Cimiotti |first3=J. |last4=Correa-de-Araujo |first4=R. |date=November 2004 |url=https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/10/11/04-0253_article |title=Nurses' working conditions: implications for infectious disease |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=1984–1989 |doi=10.3201/eid1011.040253}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the high [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]] rate, the nursing field does not have a chance to build up the already frustrated staff. Aside from the deteriorating working conditions, the real problem is "nursing’s failure to be attractive to the younger generation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Christiane |last1=Wiskow|first2=Tit|last2=Albreht|first3= Carlo|last3=de Pietro|title=How to create an attractive and supportive working environment for health professionals" Health Systems and Policy Analysis|url= http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/124416/e94293.pdf|format=PDF|website=euro.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; There’s a decline in interest among college students to consider nursing as a probable [[career]]. More than half of currently working [[nurses]] "would not recommend nursing to their own children" and a little less than a quarter would advise others to avoid this as a profession altogether.&lt;ref name="wieck2003"&gt;Wieck, K. L. (2003). Faculty for the millennium: changes needed to attract the emerging workforce into nursing. [Electronic Version]" ''Journal of Nursing Education'' 42(4), 151-8. Retrieved October 25, 2006 from Pubmed (12710805).&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian nursing researchers John Buchanan and Gillian Considine described [[hospitals]] as "being run like a business" with "issues of patient care… of secondary importance."&lt;ref name="forsythmckenzie2006"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Forsyth S., McKenzie H. | year = 2006 | title = A comparative analysis of contemporary nurses' discontents. [Electronic Version] | url = | journal = Journal of Advanced Nursing | volume = 56 | issue = 2| pages = 209–216 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2006.03999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional support, education, encouragement and counseling are integral to the everyday nursing practice. However, these practices are not easily quantified and are considered by managers as unjustified cost for the [[patients]], who are viewed as [[consumer]]s.&lt;ref name="forsythmckenzie2006"/&gt; Therefore, only clinical responsibilities, such as [[medication]] administration, dressing changes, [[foley catheter]] insertions, and anything that involves tangible supplies, are quantified and incorporated into the organization budget and plan of care for the [[consumer]]s.

The nursing shortage affects the developing countries that supply nurses through [[recruitment]] to work abroad in wealthier countries.&lt;ref name="brushsochalskiberger2004"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brush|first1= B. L.|last2= Sochalski|first2= J.|last3= Berger|first3= A. M. |year=2004|title= Imported care: recruiting foreign nurses to U.S. health care facilities. (Electronic Version) à Health Affairs, 23(3), 78-87 |accessdate=October 26, 2006 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/23/3/78?ijkey=82040093f179b956b3b2d1769736a1c23040fad0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, to accommodate perceived nursing shortage in the United States, American hospital recruit nurses from overseas, especially the [[Philippines]] and [[Africa]]. This, in turn, can lead to greater nursing shortages in their home countries. In response, in 2010 the WHO's [[World Health Assembly]] adopted the ''[[Health Human Resources#Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel|Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel]]'', a policy framework for all countries for the ethical international recruitment of nurses and other health professionals.

===Impacts on healthcare===
Nursing shortages (including low hospital-level nurse-to-patient ratios)&lt;ref name="ARHQ2004"&gt;{{cite web|last1=[[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]]|title=Hospital Nurse Staffing and Quality of Care: Research in Action, Issue 14|url=http://archive.ahrq.gov/research/findings/factsheets/services/nursestaffing/nursestaff.html|publisher=[[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]]|accessdate=4 September 2017|date=March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been linked to the following effects:&lt;ref name="stoneetal2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ARHQ2004"/&gt;
*Increased nurses’ patient workloads
*Increased risk for error, thereby compromising [[patient safety]]
*Increased risk of spreading [[infection]] to patients and staff
*Increased risk of adverse outcomes such as [[pneumonia]], [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], [[cardiac arrest]], and [[urinary tract infection]]s&lt;ref name="ARHQ2004"/&gt;
*Increased risk for occupational [[injury]]
*Increase in nursing turnover, thereby leading to greater costs for the employer and the health care system
*Increase in nurses' perception of unsafe working conditions, contributing to increased shortage and hindering local or national [[recruitment]] efforts

==Global shortage and international recruitment==
The nursing shortage takes place on a global scale. Australia, the UK, and the US receive the largest number of migrant nurses. Australia received 11,757 nurses from other countries between 1995 and 2000.&lt;ref name="pushandpull"/&gt; The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) records show that more than 10,000 foreign nurses were given H-1A visas in the same time frame.&lt;ref name="pushandpull"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kline Donna S | year = 2003 | title = Push and Pull Factors in International Nurse Migration | url = | journal = Journal of Nursing Scholarship | volume = 35 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.K. admitted 26,286 foreign nurses from 1998 to 2002.

Saudi Arabia also depends on the international nurse supply with 40 nations represented in its nurse workforce.&lt;ref name="pushandpull"/&gt; [[Netherlands]] needed to fill 7,000 nursing positions in 2002, [[England]] needed to fill 22,000 positions in 2000, and [[Canada]] would need about 10,000 nursing graduates by 2011.&lt;ref name="trossman2002"/&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

In an [[American Hospital Association]] study, the cost to replace one [[nurse]] in the U.S. was estimated at around $30,000–$64,000.&lt;ref name="stoneetal2004"/&gt; This amount is likely related to the cost of recruiting and training nurses into the organization. Hiring foreign nurses is more financially taxing compared to hiring domestic-graduate nurses; however, facilities save money in the long run because foreign nurses have a contractual obligation to complete their term.&lt;ref name="brushsochalskiberger2004"/&gt; The [[Joint Commission|JACHO]] in the United States wrote in a 2002 research report on the shortage in the US that recruiting foreign trained nurses from abroad (not referring to those who reside in the United States already) does not help the global nursing shortage and, in fact, perpetuates it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Joint Commission]]|url=http://www.jointcommission.org/NR/rdonlyres/5C138711-ED76-4D6F-909F-B06E0309F36D/0/health_care_at_the_crossroads.pdf|format=PDF|title=Health Care at the Crossroads: Strategies for Addressing the Evolving Nursing Crisis|location= Washington, D.C. |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries that send their nurses abroad experience a shortage and strain on their [[health care system]]s.

In [[South Africa]], accelerated [[recruitment]] by developed countries such as [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]] has placed more pressure on the health care system due to prevalence of [[diseases]], such as [[AIDS]], and limited resources.&lt;ref name="brushsochalskiberger2004"/&gt; Similar to the U.S., [[nurses]] who leave the organization are a financial disadvantage due to the need to fund recruiting and retraining of new nurses into the system. It has been estimated that every [[nurse]] who leaves South Africa is an annual loss of $184,000 to the country,&lt;ref name="brushsochalskiberger2004"/&gt; related to the financial and economical impact of the nursing shortage.

The following table represents the number of nurses per 100,000-population in southern African countries.&lt;ref name="brushsochalskiberger2004"/&gt;

In India international migration has been considered as one of the reasons behind shortages of nursing workforce. Social, economic and professional reasons have been cited behind this shortfall.&lt;ref name="Gill2003"&gt;Gill, Reema. (2011). Nursing Shortage in India with special reference to International Migration of Nurses. Social Medicine, 6(1), 52-59. Retrieved June 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Retention of nurses by sending (often developing) countries can be addressed by improving working conditions, minimizing wage differentials, and promoting medical tourism.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Retention can also be promoted through educational activities to improve job satisfaction. There can be additional unintended impacts of nurses migration abroad. For example, there is growing evidence that [[physicians]] in the [[Philippines]] have shifted to the nursing field for better export opportunities.&lt;ref name="brushsochalskiberger2004"/&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) representative in Manila believes the government should invest more into its health sector as it is 3% of the Philippines' GDP.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Others have suggested programs which require domestic service or employment upon graduation.

===Ethical concerns===
{{editorial|section|date=October 2015}}
Foreign nurses that migrate from developing countries to fill the nursing shortage of developed nations pursue their own economic, career, and lifestyle interests, but there are risks. The media and scholars have remained relatively silent on the ethical concerns involving the potential exploitation of foreign nurses.{{According to whom|date=October 2015}} On the level of national sovereignty and global equality, there are ethical concerns about the pull of developed nations on developing countries' skilled workers and assets. U.S. incentives such as signing bonuses can be seen as promoting [[brain drain]]. Activists have spread a new term for this: "Brain drain in the south, brain waste in the north."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manalansan|first= Ely |title=Brain Drain Refrain|website=bulatlat.com|date= 1 February 2003|accessdate=29 April 2010|url=http://bulatlat.com/news/2-50/2-50-braindrain.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president of the Philippines Nurse Association, George Codero, was quoted in a ''New York Times'' article as saying "The Filipino people will suffer because the U.S. will get all our trained nurses".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/24/world/americas/24nurses.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0 U.S. Plan to Lure Nurses May Hurt Poor Nations], ''New York Times'', May 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="curranberger1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Nurse Migration - Curran and Berger LLP Immigration Law|date=5 May 2010|url=http://curranberger.com/content/view/58/98/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On an individual basis, foreign nurses are subject to exploitation by employers. In 1998 six Americans were charged with falsely obtaining H-1A visas and using them to employ Filipino nurses as nurse aides instead of registered nurses.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In a case in 1996, a Catholic archdiocese employed some of these foreign nurses as nurse aides instead of nurses. In 2000, Filipino nurses in Missouri received $2.1 million for failure to receive proper wages that an American in the same position would receive. While these cases were brought to court, many similar situations are left unreported thereby jeopardizing the rights of foreign nurses. Foreign nurses have the tendency to receive less desirable jobs, such as entry-level positions, because of their immigrant status; they are excluded from jobs that would lead to facilities and are often not paid proper salaries.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Some U.S. health care facilities push to "ease restrictions" on the [[immigration]] law to increase the number of recruited foreign [[nurses]]. On the other hand, this [[recruitment]] practice is a temporary solution that does not fully address the nursing shortage as mentioned by [[American Nursing Association]] (ANA).&lt;ref name="trossman2002" /&gt; Others have taken a stand on ethically recruiting foreign workers. New York University Medical Center was cited in ''The Search for Nurses Ends in Manila'' as believing that it is a "poaching exercise" to take nurses from countries in need of their citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ching|first= Cheryl D. |title=The Search for Nurses Ends in Manila|website=americancity.org|accessdate=May 7, 2010|url=http://americancity.org/magazine/article/the-search-for-nurses-ends-in-manila-ching}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former health secretary, Dr. Galvez Tan, in reference to the doctors and nurses working for an American green card said, "There has to be give and take, not just take, take, take by the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dugger|first= Celia W|title=U.S. Plan to Lure Nurses May Hurt Poor Nations|newspaper= New York Times |date=24 May 2006 |accessdate=May 6, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/24/world/americas/24nurses.html?pagewanted=print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shortage by country==

=== Morocco ===
Morocco has far fewer nurses and other paramedical staff per capita than other countries of comparable national income. The number of nurses in Morocco was 29.025 in 2011, two thirds being registered nurses and one third auxiliary nurses, a ratio of 8 nurses per 10,000 population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SANTE EN CHIFFRE 2012 |url=http://srvweb.sante.gov.ma/Publications/Etudes_enquete/Documents/Sante%20en%20chiffres%202012_Edition%202013.pdf |publisher=Ministry of Health, Morocco |accessdate=1 August 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Morocco has been classified among 57 countries suffering from a glaring shortage of medically trained human resources.

A recent study by the European Institute of Health Sciences (Institut Européen des Sciences de la Santé) in Casablanca based on scientific modeling of future needs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pourquoi choisir une carrière dans la santé? |url=http://iessmaroc.com/pourquoi-une-carriere-en-sante.html/|publisher=Institut Européen des Sciences de la Santé, Maroc |accessdate=1 August 2014 |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that the situation will worsen and that to bridge the nursing gap, Morocco needs to produce between 40,000 and 80,000 new nurse graduates until the year 2025.

=== Philippines ===
The Philippines is the largest exporter of nurses in the world supplying 25% of all overseas nurses.&lt;ref name="matsuno"&gt;{{cite web|last=Matsuno|first=Ayaka|title=Nurse Migration: Asian Perspective|website=docstoc.com|date=May 6, 2010|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/17901372/Nurse-Migration_-Asian-Perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] study reported that one of every six foreign-born nurses in the OECD countries is from the Philippines.&lt;ref name="carlos"&gt;Carlos, Maria R., and Chizuko Sato. "Sending Society's Responses to International Migration of Nurses and Its Policy Implications: The Case of the Philippines." Ritsumeikan International Affairs 6 (2008): 27-51. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Of all employed Filipino RNs, roughly 85% are working overseas.&lt;ref name="nursemigration"&gt;Perrin, M. E., A. Hagopian, A. Sales, and B. Huang. "Nurse Migration and Its Implications for Philippine Hospitals." International Council of Nurses (2007): 219-26. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This is partially in response to the inability of Filipino nurses to enter their domestic workforce due to a lack of jobs and instead become heavily dependent upon international job markets for nurses. The United States has an especially prominent representation of Filipino nurses. Of the 100,000 foreign nurses working in the U.S. as of 2000, 32.6% were from the Philippines.&lt;ref name="nursemigration" /&gt;

====Reasons for international migration====
The international [[Human migration|migration]] of Filipino nurses takes place in response to "push and pull" factors. The push factors are rooted in the economic conditions in the Philippines in which there is an overabundance of RNs and a lack of open employment positions. The unemployment rate in the Philippines exceeds 10%.&lt;ref name="curranberger1" /&gt; Additionally, health care budgets set up Filipino nurses for low wages and poor benefit packages. There are fewer jobs available, thereby increasing the workload and pressure on RNs. Filipinos often pursue international employment to avoid the economic instability and poor labor conditions in their native country. The government also highly encourages the exportation of RNs internationally. Filipino nurses are pulled to work abroad for the economic benefits of international positions. While a nurse in the Philippines will earn between $180 and $200 U.S. dollars per month, a nurse in the U.S. receives a salary of $4,000 per month.&lt;ref name="film" /&gt; Nurses abroad are greatly respected in the Philippines as they are able to support an entire family at home through remittances. In 1993, Filipinos abroad sent $800 million to their families in the Philippines thereby supporting the economy.&lt;ref name="pushandpull" /&gt; Additionally, remittances from Filipinos made up 5.2% of the Filipino GDP (gross national product) between 1990 and 2000.&lt;ref name="nursemigration" /&gt; Further pull factors stem from the additional economic benefits of signing bonuses in the U.S. To attract more foreign nurses, U.S. hospitals increased signing bonuses from $1,000 to $7,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Filipino Nurses Becoming More in Demand in Rich Countries|website=Nurse Immigration USA|date=May 5, 2010|url=http://www.nurseimmigrationusa.com/Downloads/CoreFiles/Filipino_nurses_becoming_more_in_demand.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positions abroad in the health sector are also enticing for their immigration benefits. Throughout the past 50 years of nurse migration, the U.S. has made efforts to ease the visa application process to further encourage international nurses to relieve the nursing shortage. Scholars note that the better living and working conditions, higher income, and opportunities for career advancement draw nurses from the Philippines to work in the U.S.

As the relation between the U.S. and the Philippines stretches back 50 years, Filipino nursing institutions often reflect the same education standards and methods as the U.S. curriculum. Furthermore, a knowledge of English in the Philippines makes it easier for Filipino nurses (rather than nurses from other developing nations) to work in the U.S.

Since 1916, 2,000 nurses have arrived each year in the U.S.&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{cite news|last=Petrun|first= Erin|title=Unhealthy Exodus Of Filipino Nurses|newspaper= Breaking News Headlines: Business, Entertainment &amp; World News - CBS News|date=January 12, 2007|accessdate=April 29, 2010|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/11/uttm/main2354701.shtml?tag=currentVideoInfo;videoMetaInfo}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the U.S. approved 50,000 migrant visas for these nurses.&lt;ref name="cbs" /&gt; Today, on average, there are about 30,000 Filipino nurses traveling to the U.S. each year.

====Effects of migration====
The transnational migration of Filipino RNs has profound effects on the economy and workforce dynamics in both sending and receiving nations. The departure of nurses from the domestic workforce represents a loss of skilled personnel and the economic investment in education. In addition, the "scarce and relatively expensive-to-train resources" invested are lost when a worker chooses to work abroad.&lt;ref name="pushandpull" /&gt; When RNs migrate internationally, the country they emigrate from loses a valuable resource and any financial or educational support that was invested in the individual.

According to many Filipinos working in hospitals, the most educated and skilled nurses are the first to go abroad. There is disagreement among scholars on the extent to which the Filipino health sector is burdened by its nursing shortage. While the numerical data are inconsistent about whether the nurse supply is in excess or a shortage, it is clear that there is a short supply of the most skilled nurses who go abroad. As a result, operating rooms are often staffed by novice nurses, and nurses with more experience work extremely long hours. As skilled nurses decline in the urban areas, nurses from rural areas migrate to hospitals in the cities for better pay. As a result, rural communities experience a drain of health resources. Stories and studies alike demonstrate that a treatable emergency in the provinces may be fatal because there are no medical professionals to help treat them. In fact, "the number of Filipinos dying without medical attention has been steadily increasing for the last decade."&lt;ref name="film"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/rough/2007/12/philippines_hav.html|title=FRONTLINE/WORLD . Rough Cut . Philippines: Have Degree, Will Travel - PBS|work=pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of attention from medical professionals has increased despite advances in technology and medicine and the increasing number of trained nurses in the Philippines.

Doctors, too, have changed professions and joined the international mobility trend. Filipino doctors have begun leaving their professions to train as nurses under the title MD-RN with the hope of immigrating to the U.S. or other developed nations more easily. Since 2000, 3,500 Filipino doctors have migrated abroad as nurses.&lt;ref name="matsuno" /&gt; The U.S. incentives for nurse migration encourage doctors to train as nurses in the hopes of increasing their economic prospects. As a result, the Philippines have a lower average of doctors and nurses with 0.58 and 1.69 respectively for a population of 1,000. The average statistics globally in contrast are 1.23 and 2.56.&lt;ref name="carlos" /&gt; Between 2002 and 2007, 1,000 Filipino hospitals closed due to a shortage of health workers. A study conducted by the former Philippine Secretary of Health, Jaime Galvez-Tan, concluded that close to 80% of government doctors have become nurses or are studying nursing.&lt;ref name="film" /&gt; Of the 9,000 doctors-turned-nurses, 5,000 are working overseas.&lt;ref name="film" /&gt; The extraordinary influence of this international migration has had devastating effects on the health of Filipinos. The number of deaths that were not prevented with medical attention have increased as hospitals are shut down and rural areas are deprived of any medical treatment.

Due to the high interest in international mobility, there is little permanency in the nursing positions in the Philippines. Most RNs choose to sign short-term contracts that will allow for more flexibility to work overseas. Filipino nurses feel less committed to the hospitals as they are temporary staff members. This lack of attachment and minimal responsibility worsens the health of Filipino patients.

The education system has also been hurt by the increase of nurses in the Philippines. As Filipinos are attracted to working as nurses, the number of nursing students has steadily increased. As a result, the number of nursing programs has grown quickly in a commercialized manner. In the 1970s, there were only 40 nursing schools in the Philippines; by 2005 the number had grown to 441 nursing colleges.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.docstoc.com/docs/14919026/Brain-Drain-Care-Drain-and-Other-Issues-in-Health/&lt;/ref&gt; While the education opportunities for nursing students has grown tremendously, the quality of education has declined. This can be seen by the low rate (50%) of students who pass the nursing exam since the 1990s. Furthermore, the Technical Committee on Nursing Education of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) determined that 23% of Filipino nursing schools failed to meet the requirements set by the government.&lt;ref name="matsuno" /&gt;

In summary, the emigration of Filipino nurses has encouraged doctors to switch to nursing, created a shortage of skilled specialized and experienced nurses, affected the education system, and distorted [[health care]] delivery and attention to medical issues in rural areas. While remittances, return migration, and the transfer of knowledge support the Philippines, they fail to fully compensate the loss of [[health workforce|health workers]], which disrupts the Filipino health and education sectors.

Dr. Jaime-Galvez Tan, the former Philippine Secretary of Health, warns that if the U.S. passes legislation allowing for freer immigration of nurses the health service of the Philippines could collapse.&lt;ref name="film" /&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In October 2015 The UK Government announced that Nurses will be added to the government’s shortage occupation list on an interim basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Restrictions on nurse recruitment from overseas changed - News stories - GOV.UK|url = https://www.gov.uk/government/news/restrictions-on-nurse-recruitment-from-overseas-changed|website = www.gov.uk|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, 207 out of 232 English hospitals (90%) reported nursing shortages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Nurse shortage hits dangerous levels in 90% of hospitals, report finds|url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/21/nurse-shortage-dangerous-90-of-hospitals|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 2015-12-21|access-date = 2016-02-03|issn = 0261-3077|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016 the [[Royal College of Nursing|RCN]] stated that more than 10,000 nursing posts went unfilled in 2015.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|title = More than 10,000 nursing posts unfilled in London|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35242993|website = BBC News|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represented a 3% increase year on year from 11% in 2013, 14% in 2014 and 17% in 2015 of all London nursing positions and 10% as an average nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Warning over ‘critical shortage’ of nurses as vacancies rise to 10,000|url = https://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/warning-over-critical-shortage-of-nurses-as-vacancies-rise-to-10000-a3150916.html|website = Evening Standard|access-date = 2016-02-03|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a BBC article the Department of Health said it did not recognise the figures.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

===United States===
According to the American [[National Council of State Boards of Nursing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsbn.org/1237.htm|title=NCLEX Examination Pass Rates|website= National Council of State Boards of Nursing, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; the number of U.S. trained nurses has been increasing over the past decade: In 2000, 71,475 U.S.-trained nurses became newly licensed. In 2005, 99,187 U.S.-trained nurses became newly licensed. In 2009, 134,708 U.S.-trained nurses became newly licensed. Therefore, a 9.8% annual increase of newly licensed U.S. nurses has been observed each year over nine years. It is clear that, nursing enrollment in the U.S. has significantly increased over the past decade relative to the 1.19% annual U.S. population growth.

While the number of U.S. trained licensed nurses has increased each year, the projected nursing demand growth rate from 2008 to 2018, as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos083.htm|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition: Registered Nurses}}&lt;/ref&gt; is anticipated to be 22%, or 2.12% annually. Therefore, the 9.8% annual growth of new RN's exceeds the current new position growth rate by a net of 7.7% per year with the assumption of consistent growth figures over the next decade.

The [[United States]] population is projected to grow at least 18% over two decades in the 21st century, while the [[population]] of those 65 and older is expected to increase three times that rate.&lt;ref name="brushsochalskiberger2004"/&gt; The increase in the number of elderly is projected to lead to an increase demand for nurses in senior care facilities as well as the need to fill the positions of nurses as they reach retirement age. Projections suggest that by 2020 to 2025 one third of the current RN and LPN workforce will be eligible to retire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future of Nursing|url=http://nursing.norwich.edu/the-future-of-nursing/|website=Norwich University|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current shortfall of [[nurses]] is projected at 800,000 by the year 2020.&lt;ref name="brushsochalskiberger2004"/&gt;

Professional health and related occupations were expected to rapidly increase between 2000 and 2012. The demand for health care practitioners and technical occupations will continue to increase. It is projected that there will be 1.7 million job openings between 2000 and 2012. The demand for registered nurses is even higher. Registered nurses are predicted to have 1,101,000 openings due to growth during this 10-year period.&lt;ref name="hecker2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hecker|first= D.E. |year=2004|title=Occupational Employment Projections to 2012.

Other research findings report a projection of opposite trend. Although the demand for nurses continues to increase, the rate of employment has slowed down since 1994 because [[hospitals]] were incorporating more less-skilled nursing personnel to substitute for [[nurses]].&lt;ref name="buerhausstaiger1999"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buerhaus|first1= P. I.|last2=Staiger|first2= D. O. |year=1999|title= Trouble in the nursing labor market?

[[Wage]] among [[nurses]] leveled off in correlation with inflation between 1990 and 1994.&lt;ref name="buerhausstaiger1999"/&gt; The recent economic crisis of 2009 has further decreased the demand for RNs.

Comparing the data released by the Bureau of Health Professions, the projections of shortage within two years have increased.

However, emergency and acute care nurses are in great demand, and this temporary reduction of the shortage is not expected to last as the economy improves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?hint=3&amp;DR_ID=57902|title=Economic Recession Has Temporarily Alleviated Nationwide Nursing Shortage|website= kaisernetwork.org|date= April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halsey|first= Ashley|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/04/AR2009040402871.html|title=Jobs Scarce, Even for Nurses: Economic Crisis Freezes Field Once Short of Workers|newspaper= Washington Post|date=April 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, it was reported that in places like [[Des Moines, Iowa]] newly graduated nurses were having more difficulty finding jobs and older nurses were delaying retirement due to economic conditions. This hiring situation was mostly found in hospitals; nursing homes continued to hire and recruit nurses in strong numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leys|first= Tony|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20090706/NEWS/907060319/-1/BUSINESS04|title=Nursing graduates find tighter job market|website= [[The Des Moines Register]]|date= July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states have a surplus of nurses while other states face a shortage. This is due to factors such as the number of new graduates and the total demand for nurses in each area. Some states face a severe shortage (such as the northwestern states, as well as Texas and Oklahoma), while other states have a surplus of registered nurses.

====Patching up the shortage====
Nursing shortages can be consistent or intermittent depending on the number of [[patients]] needing [[medical]] attention.

Retention and [[recruitment]] are important methods to achieve a long-term solution to the nursing shortage. Recruitment is promoted through making nursing attractive as a profession, especially to younger workers, to counteract the high average age of RNs and future waves of retirement. Refining the work environment can improve the overall perception of nursing as an occupation. This can be achieved by ensuring job satisfaction. Writers Lori Candela, Antonio Gutierrez, and Sarah Keating point out in the journal, ''Nurse Education Today'', ways the academic nursing administrators can make a change. "Individual support to attend workshops or conferences, participation in on-campus teaching/learning faculty sessions, the use of consultants with expertise in particular areas around teaching and evaluation, and mentoring networks that include senior faculty with teaching expertise" can all create a strong relationship between staff members therefore developing a better environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Candela|first=Lori|author2=Antonio Gutierrez |author3=Sarah Keating |title=A National Survey Examining the Professional Work Life of Today's Nursing Faculty|journal=Nurse Education Today|date=August 2013|volume=33|issue=8|pages=853–859|doi=10.1016/j.nedt.2012.10.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260691712003528|accessdate=27 October 2013|pmid=23146717}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, financial opportunities such as signing bonuses can attract nurses.

To assist the health sector, Congress approved the Nurse Reinvestment Act in 2002 to provide funding to advance nursing education, [[scholarships]], grants, [[Diversity (business)|diversity programs]], loan repayment programs, nursing faculty programs, and comprehensive [[geriatric]] education.&lt;ref name="beu2004"&gt;Beu, B. (2004). and the nurse reinvestment act. [Online]. AORN Journal, 79(5), 1061-1063. Retrieved June 5, 2005 from Proquest database (639206991).&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, mandatory overtime for nurses is prohibited in nine states, hospital accountability to implement valid staffing plans in seven states, and only one state implements the minimum staffing ratio.&lt;ref name="stoneetal2004"/&gt;

Other ways of assisting to fill the shortage in the United States would include giving nurses the opportunity to pick their own overtime and schedules. Also, it would be a great incentive to young nurses to enter a hospital if they knew there were bonuses for continued excellence.&lt;ref&gt;''Healthcare Financial Management'', 2005, volume 59, issue 1&lt;/ref&gt;

To respond to fluctuating needs in the short term, health care industries have used float pool nurses and agency nurses. Float pool nurses are staff employed by the [[hospital]] to work in any unit. Agency nurses are employed by an independent staffing organization and have the opportunity to work in any [[hospitals]] on a daily, weekly or contractual basis. Similar to other [[professionals]], both types of [[nurses]] can only work within their licensed [[scope of practice]], training, and certification.

Float pool nurses and agency nurses, as mentioned by First Consulting group, are used in response to the current shortage.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Use of the said services increases the cost of health care, decreases specialty, and decreases the interest in long-term solutions to the [[shortage]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

International [[recruitment]] is often used to fill the nursing gap but gives rise to concern now that the U.S. Homeland Security has stopped the issuance of the H-1C visa, which was deemed specifically for nurses. Because of the Affordable Care Act, which will result in an increased number of insured Americans, it is estimated that there will be an even greater need for nurses in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Amy|title=Backgrounder #2887 on Health Care March 18, 2014 The Impact of the Affordable Care Act on the Health Care Workforce|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2014/03/the-impact-of-the-affordable-care-act-on-the-health-care-workforce|accessdate=25 September 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. trained nurses are concerned, however, that this recruitment initiative impedes on their ability to obtain positions in the field after completing their training.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} A nursing shortage does not translate to new nursing jobs.

A growing response to the nursing shortage is the advent of [[travel nursing]] a specialized sub-set of the staffing agency industry that has evolved to serve the needs of hospitals affected. According to the [[Professional Association of Nurse Travelers]], there are an estimated 25,500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pantravelers.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=7754&amp;Itemid=33|title=PanTravelers - Total number of active nurse travelers|author=Phil Light|work=pantravelers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; working in the U.S. The number of LVN/LPN nurse travelers is not known.

There is a nursing recruitment initiative and nursing workforce development program for residents of the United States originally from foreign countries, who were professional nurses in their countries but are no longer in that profession in the United States. This initiative helps them get back into the nursing profession, especially getting through credentialing and the nursing board exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://welcomebackinitiative.org/|title=Welcome Back Initiative|work=welcomebackinitiative.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original model was developed in 2001 at San Francisco State University in cooperation with [[City College of San Francisco]] ("The San Francisco Welcome Back Center"). There are centers in many cities, such as Los Angeles, San Diego, and Boston—where it is called a "Boston Welcome Back Center for Internationally Educated Nurses".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhcc.mass.edu/inside/18 Boston Welcome Back Center for Internationally Educated Nurses"]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a program meant for residents of the United States only.&lt;ref&gt;Fifield, Mary L., {{cite journal|url=http://www.nebhe.org/info/pdf/nejhe/NEJHE_Winter08.pdf|format=PDF|title=World-Class Care: Boston Welcome Back Center Puts Internationally Educated Nurses Back to Work|journal= New England Journal of Higher Education|volume=22 n4 |pages=17–18 Winter 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boston Welcome Back Center was opened in October 2005 with a $50,000 seed grant from the Board of Higher Education’s Nursing Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mendelsohn|first= Janet|url=http://www.janetmendelsohn.com/docs/WBCarticle_June_2006_Mag.pdf|format=PDF|title=Welcome Back Program Addresses Critical Nursing Shortage - Bunker Hill Community College magazine|website=janetmendelsohn.com|date= June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legislation====
In 2004, California became the first state to legally mandate minimum nurse-to-patient staffing ratios in acute care hospitals.&lt;ref name="Aiken2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aiken LH, Sloane DM, Cimiotti JP, Clarke SP, Flynn L, Seago JA, Spetz J, Smith HL|title=Implications of the California nurse staffing mandate for other states|journal=Health Serv Res|date=August 2010|volume=45|issue=4|pages=904–21|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2010.01114.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6773.2010.01114.x/full|accessdate=4 September 2017|pmc=2908200|pmid=20403061}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent study evaluated the effect on outcomes for nurses and patients by comparing outcomes in California in the subsequent two years with those of New Jersey and Pennsylvania — two similar states without such mandates.&lt;ref name="Aiken2010"/&gt; There was substantial compliance with the mandate in California, with over 80% compliance rates reported across several different units of surveyed hospitals; equivalent levels of non-mandated compliance in the comparator states were considerably lower, at 19%, 52%, and 63% compliance in medical/surgical, [[pediatric medicine|pediatric]], and [[intensive care unit]]s (ICUs) in New Jersey and 33%, 66%, and 71% in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Aiken2010"/&gt; After extensive adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics, the study revealed statistically significant relationships between the nurse-to-patient ratio and 30-day mortality and [[failure to rescue]] (FTR — that is, failure to prevent a clinically-important deterioration, such as death or permanent disability, from a complication of an underlying illness or of medical care) in all three states.&lt;ref name="Aiken2010"/&gt; Across all three states, facilities with nurse-to-patient ratios consistent with those mandated in California were associated with lower rates of nursing [[Occupational burnout|burnout]], and nurses reported consistently better quality of care.&lt;ref name="Aiken2010"/&gt;

In September 2007, in the 110th Congress, Senator [[Dick Durbin|Richard Durbin]] of Illinois introduced S.2064: Nurse Training and Retention Act of 2007 on the floor of the Senate. It was a bill to fund comprehensive programs to ensure an adequate supply of nurses. It was referred to committee for study but was never reported on by the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-2064|title=H.R.2064|publisher= [[GovTrack]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, in the 110th Congress, H.R. 5924: Emergency Nursing Supply Relief Act was introduced as a bill to the House of Representatives by [[Robert Wexler]] of Florida. If it had passed, it would have amended the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act of 2000 and would have given up to 20,000 visas per year to nurses and physical therapists until September 2011. Immediate family members of visa beneficiaries would not be counted against the 20,000 yearly cap. The bill was referred to committees for study in Congress but was never reported on by the committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-5924|title= H.R. 5924|website=govtrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.5924|title=H.R.5924 Emergency Nursing Supply Relief Act (Introduced in House)|website=[[THOMAS]] Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h5924/show|title=H.R.5924: Emergency Nursing Supply Relief Act - U.S. Congress - OpenCongress|work=OpenCongress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 11, 2009, legislation was introduced by Representatives [[John Shadegg]] (R-AZ), [[Jeff Flake]] (R-AZ), and [[Ed Pastor]] (D-AZ) in the 111th Congress to the House of Representatives, HR 1001 ("The Nursing Relief Act of 2009": To create a new non-immigrant visa category for registered nurses, and for other purposes) making a new non-immigrant "W" visa category for nurses to be able to work in the United States. This was to relieve the nursing shortage still considered to be a crisis despite the economic problems in the country. The proposed bill was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary but was never reported on by Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1001 The Nursing Relief Act of 2009 (HR1001) tracked in the Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalimmigrationcounsel.com/2009/03/articles/us-immigration/proposed-nonimmigrant-visa-category-for-professional-nurses-would-help-fix-the-shortage-of-qualified-nurses/ |title=Proposed Nonimmigrant Visa Category for Professional Nurses Would Help Fix the Shortage of Qualified Nurses|publisher= globalimmigrationcounsel.com|date= March 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.1001.IH|title=Nursing Relief Act of 2009 (Introduced in House) HR 1001 IH|publisher= Library of Congress [[THOMAS]] (contains the full proposed bill)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes more strategies for funding and retention. The act provides funding for advanced education nursing grants, diversity grants, and offers a nurse education loan repayment program. The program repays over half of the student loans if the nursing student signs a contract stating that they will work for two years at a medical facility that has a nursing shortage.&lt;ref name="Nursing Student Loan Forgiveness"&gt;{{cite web|title=College Nursing Scholarships &amp; Grants for Nursing|url=http://www.nursingscholarships.org/nursing-student|work=College Nursing Scholarships &amp; Grants|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The Nurse Reinvestment Act of 2002 had many strategies. The law authorized and had provisions that included topics such as loan repayment programs and scholarships, providing more grants to the nursing students, making more public service announcements about nursing and educating the public on what a great profession it is and making nursing school more flexible by creating options for the people who already have a degree but would like to go into nursing.&lt;ref name="The Nurse Reinvestment Act"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nurse Reinvestment|url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/2002/rpt/2002-R-0712.htm|work=The Nurse Reinvestment Act|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Immigration process to U.S.====
Nurses seeking to immigrate to the U.S. can apply as direct hires or through a recruitment agency. For entry to the U.S. a foreign nurse must pass a Visa Screen which includes three parts of the process. First they must pass a creditable review, followed by a test of nursing knowledge called the [[Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools]] examination (CGFNS), and finally a test of English-language proficiency.

Foreign nurses compete amongst themselves, with professionals, and other skilled workers for 140,000 employment-based (EB) visas every year.&lt;ref name="feet"/&gt; Filipino nurses are only allocated 2,800 visas per year, thereby creating a backlog among applicants. For example, in September 2009, 56,896 Filipinos were waiting for EB-3 visa numbers.&lt;ref name="feet"&gt;Pastor, Cristina DC. "Once a Hospital Mainstay, Filipino Immigrant Nurses Face Dwindling Job Opportunities." Feet in 2 Worlds. Center of New York City Affairs, 14 Apr. 2010. Web. 05 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This number contrasts with the 95,000 nurses licensed in 2009, many of whom want to migrate to the U.S. Once a nurse obtains a visa number and is approved for a visa and authorized to work in the U.S., they must pass the National Council Licensure Examination to qualify for U.S. nursing standards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13081">The '''Olympics Triplecast''' was an experimental [[pay-per-view]] telecast in the [[United States of America|United States]] during the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], Spain. While an ambitious project, it was a massive financial failure.

==Overview and history==
[[NBC]], which had broadcast rights to the Games,&lt;ref group=Note name=Note01/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://jeff560.tripod.com/tv8.html | title= TV Broadcasting History – The World Comes Together in Your Living Room: The Olympics on TV| first= Joseph |last= Gallant | accessdate= 6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; thought that viewers would be willing to pay US$95 to $170 to see events live, which would normally be shown on [[broadcast delay|tape delay]] on the network in [[prime time]]. It partnered with [[Cablevision]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/our-history#decade_7|title=The 1992 Barcelona Olympics|last= |first= |date= |website=NBC Sports History Page|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the prominent New York cable provider, to create three channels: Red, White, and Blue.  A special three-button [[remote control]] with the colors of the channels as the buttons was offered by some cable operators for free as a lure to sign up for the service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081010040835/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb4895/is_199201/ai_n17999082 Article] at findarticles.com&lt;/ref&gt; Channels aired twelve hours a day (from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]) then repeated their content for the other twelve hours.&lt;ref name="nyt71792"&gt;"Triplecast Ads Are Cited." ''New York Times'' 17 Jul. 1992: 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Programs came from the world feed.&lt;ref&gt;Sarni, Jim. [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1992-07-27/news/9202210808_1_triplecast-click-balance-beam "Quick Remote Trigger Is A Triplecast Must"], ''Miami Sun-Sentinel'', 27 July 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  As an inducement for people to order the Triplecast, NBC featured star announcers and pundits, such as [[Chick Hearn]] for basketball.  This was nothing new for NBC as the network employed [[Vin Scully]] for its [[World Series]] telecasts.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCkYon5qjWI&lt;/ref&gt;

===Channel programs===
* The Blue channel featured [[Swimming at the 1992 Summer Olympics|swimming]] events during the first week and [[Athletics at the 1992 Summer Olympics|track and field]] events during the second week. 
* The White channel featured many individual sports, such as [[Gymnastics at the 1992 Summer Olympics|gymnastics]], [[Boxing at the 1992 Summer Olympics|boxing]], [[Rowing at the 1992 Summer Olympics|rowing]], [[Equestrian at the 1992 Summer Olympics|equestrian]] and other minor sports.
* The Red channel featured team sports, such as [[Boxing at the 1992 Summer Olympics|basketball]], [[Baseball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|baseball]], [[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|volleyball]], [[Water polo at the 1992 Summer Olympics|water polo]], and [[Handball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|team handball]].

==Issues==
Several issues plagued the Triplecast.

===Logistics===
Cable providers took a lower profit cut than they normally do for pay-per-view events. A national center was also set up (1-800-OLYMPIC) to take calls, but it often had trouble telling if a viewer's cable system was participating. In January 1992, for instance, [[Chuck Dolan]], head of Cablevision, tested the ordering system, which could not tell if his Cablevision Long Island system was carrying the Triplecast.&lt;ref name="nyt62992"&gt;Sandomir, Richard. [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/29/sports/olympics-triplecast-an-olympian-blunder-or-innovation.html "OLYMPICS; Triplecast: An Olympian Blunder or Innovation?"], ''The New York Times'', 29 June 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low uptake===
The biggest issue with ''Triplecast'' was low uptake. NBC estimated two million people would subscribe to the programming.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;Zoglin, Richard; Ty, William. "How Much Is Too Much?" ''TIME'' 10 Aug. 1992: 64.&lt;/ref&gt; But ''TripleCast'' projections were around 200,000-250,000, and the ''Pay-Per-View Update'' industry newsletter estimated only 125,000. Early reports of slow sales even inspired [[David Letterman]], then still at NBC, to make jokes about the ''Triplecast''.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; Midway through the games, discounts were applied for one-day service and weekend packages were added. But the attempts to boost subscription largely failed. Another attempt to boost interest was made, by airing a three-way [[split screen (film)|split screen]] of the ''TripleCast'' channels in hour-long blocks on [[CNBC]], but with no audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://sportsrantz.com/media/2012/07/25/olympics-triplecast/| title= 20 Years After: The Olympics Triplecast| author= Diamond Joe |date= 25 July 2012 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120804160207/http://sportsrantz.com/media/2012/07/25/olympics-triplecast/| deadurl= yes| accessdate= 6 July 2015| archivedate= 4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final tally of ''Olympics Triplecast'' subscribers was 200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://london2012.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/25/happy-anniversary-triplecast/ | title= Happy Anniversary, Triplecast | last= Sandomir| first= Richard| date= 25 July 2012| work= The New York Times ''blog''| accessdate= 6 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was enough of a flop that Chuck Dolan was already acknowledging by August 6 that "the public didn't find enough incremental value for the ''Triplecast'' over what they could get on NBC" and that "we blew it from an economic point of view." It also surfaced that research figures were enhanced. While one percent of surveyed viewers said they would "definitely" buy the ''TripleCast'', that number was enhanced in press materials by adding those who declared they would "probably" buy the service.&lt;ref name="sandomir8692"&gt;Sandomir, Richard. "BARCELONA; Overpricing of Olympics' Triplecast Service Is Acknowledged", ''The New York Times'' 6 Aug. 1992: 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cannibalizing the main coverage===
The TripleCast service took a very austere, no-frills approach to broadcasting that included play-by-play and commentary, but few graphics and absolutely no feature stories or background vignettes. According to some TripleCast viewers, this made the main NBC coverage seem "schmaltzy and overproduced".&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; In addition, NBC's main coverage was denigrated to some extent, with Triplecast viewers knowing some results 10 hours or more before the events were aired on the main network.

===Advertising===
Original Triplecast advertising promoted that the service was "live with no interruptions" — though half of the broadcast day was a repeat. The New York City Consumer Affairs Department charged NBC and Cablevision with deception in advertising as a result.&lt;ref name="nyt71792"/&gt; Eventually, the parties settled, with NBC and Cablevision agreeing to clarify the advertising.&lt;ref&gt;"OLYMPICS; Settlement In Triplecast Ads." ''The New York Times'' 22 July 1992: 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, about 10 percent of NBC's 205 affiliates refused to run Triplecast advertising because they did not want to promote competition for their broadcast.&lt;ref name="nyt62992"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Even before the Olympics started, many criticized the business model. On July 16, nine days before the Opening Ceremony, one ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' writer called it "the biggest marketing disaster since [[New Coke]]".&lt;ref&gt;Macnow, Glen. [http://articles.philly.com/1992-07-16/sports/26025616_1_nbc-s-triplecast-nbc-chief-executive-olympic-coverage-nbc "Triplecast May Be A National Failure At This Year's Games NBC Needs A Huge Viewing Audience To Make Its $401 Million Gamble On The Olympics Pay Off. So Far, It's Not Even Close."], ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', 16 July 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The Triplecast was deemed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' "sports TV's biggest flop" and that NBC and Cablevision were "bereft in sanity" in operating it.&lt;ref&gt;Sandomir, Richard. "Click, Click, Click: The Year In Gaffes", ''The New York Times'' 25 December 1992: 8.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1994, it was referred to as "the ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' of television".&lt;ref&gt;Sandomir, Richard. "SPORTS BUSINESS; Some Shaky Precedents for New York Sports Fans." ''New York Times'' 28 Aug. 1994: 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Kim, the editor of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', went on [[National Public Radio]] and called it "an unmitigated disaster for NBC".&lt;ref&gt;DePrez, Greg. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18601621.html "The Olympics TripleCast: still revolutionary, still relevant"], ''Multichannel News'' 22 June 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a loss of about $100 million (half of which was covered by Cablevision under agreement) for the two parties. It also shaped NBC's strategies in the coverage of future Olympics.

NBC did not use pay-per-view to cover any future games. While NBC alone broadcast the [[1996 Summer Olympic Games]] in the United States, NBC decided to use [[cable television]] partners for its subsequent telecasts. [[Olympics on CBS|CBS]], which had the broadcast rights to the [[1994 Winter Olympic Games|1994]] and [[1998 Winter Olympic Games]], also used a cable partner, [[Olympics on TNT|TNT]].

*[[CNBC]] and [[MSNBC]] showed the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Summer Games]] and [[2002 Winter Olympic Games|2002 Winter Games]] along with NBC, and three newer acquisitions ([[Bravo (US TV network)|Bravo]] and [[USA Network]] in English and [[Telemundo]] in Spanish) joined the coverage for the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Games]]. [[Universal HD]] was added for the [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Winter Games]]. This arrangement continued, with [[Oxygen (TV network)|Oxygen]] taking the place of Bravo for the 2008 Games, and excluded from the 2010 Games due to a lack of programming (NBC's digital subchannel [[Universal Sports]] began to air analysis shows during those Games). The [[NBC Sports Network]] showed all U.S. Olympic events in the [[2012 Olympic Games]].
*For the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], NBC offered to cable operators the NBC Olympic Basketball Channel and NBC Olympic Soccer Channel, which broadcast exclusively in [[high definition television|high definition]] and aired all the events in both sports without any commercial interruptions. During halftimes and before each game, a wide-angle shot of the venue from the default world feed was shown instead along with highlights without commentary, while non-programming hours consisted of rolling statistics or a [[test pattern]]; later years now feature a continuous loop of the previous day's action. The network also used the same setup for the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] and [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.engadget.com/2012/05/27/nbc-london-olympics-2012-streaming-tv-3d/ | title= NBC lays out 2012 London Olympics broadcast plan on TV, internet, apps and in 3D | first= Richard |last= Lawler |work= Engadget| date= 27 May 2012| accessdate= 6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*During the 2008 Summer Olympics, NBC also streamed 2,200 hours of 25 different sports live on [http://www.nbcolympics.com NBCOlympics.com]. Most events shown on NBCOlympics.com were shown with no commentary. The number of hours of coverage has expanded further for each succeeding Games.
*For the 2018 Winter Olympics, the addition of the new [[Olympic Channel (United States)|Olympic Channel]] will allow further expansion overall to the network's schedule of coverage.

NBC currently holds the U.S. rights to the Olympics through 2032.

==Notes==
{{reflist|group=Note|refs=
&lt;ref name=Note01&gt;By 1992, televising the Olympics had become a costly proposition. NBC won the rights to the Summer Games in Barcelona with a bid of $401 million, thinking ABC and CBS were both going to bid $400 million each (in the end, the highest rival bid was closer to $ 300 million). In an attempt to recoup the cost, NBC decided, in addition to its own extensive over-the-air TV coverage, to partner with Cablevision Systems Corporation (who were joint owners of [[Rainbow Programming Holdings]], parent company to several cable networks) and produce round-the-clock (twelve hours live each day, then repeated for the next twelve hours) coverage of other Olympic events on three pay-per-view channels. The venture was a financial disaster, with NBC and Cablevision each losing about $50 million each.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Pembe Candaner was born in [[Ankara, Turkey]] as the second child of lawyer/poet Suphi Taşhan, a member of famous Tashan family in Ankara, and Mualla Taşhan. Suphi Tashan, a very well-known figure in Turkey, died at the age of 39, when Pembe was just two years old. Tashan family was the wealthiest family in Ankara at the time, giving their name to Tashan Square, today known as [[Ulus Square]]. Mualla was working as a speechwriter for the prime minister. In an interview, Candaner told to ''[[Hurriyet]]'', "''I had to write essays for school she wouldn't write them for me. I was so mad, because I was competing against my best friend, whose father was a great speaker and certainly helped her. My mom said, 'One day you'll be grateful; grades are not important, learning is'.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/|title=Hürriyet Daily News|website=Hürriyet Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from TED Ankara College, she obtained her BSc. degree from [[Middle East Technical University]] (METU), Department of Psychology in 1980. She received her MA from [[Ankara University]] DTCF, Department of Art History.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Upon her graduation, she lectured in Middle East Technical University, Ankara and [[Marmara University]], Istanbul on Psychology and Social Sciences. After having education in Finance and Business Administration, she moved from academic world to private sector.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Career==
===Private sector===
In 1997, Candaner was appointed Country Manager (Turkey) of [[Adecco SA]]. Later she became the CEO of Adecco Turkey, GM of Lee Hecht Harrisson and had a chair in the Board of Directors and remained in this position for nine years. In 2003, Candaner played a central role in changing the Labor Law and the legalization of Private Employment Agencies. The law also legalized temporary work, work-on-call and part-time work, which was previously not legal in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/main.aspx?home=http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2003/06/20030610.htm&amp;main=http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2003/06/20030610.htm|title=T.C.

[[File:Power of attorney.jpg|thumb|Power of attorney]]
A '''power of attorney''' ('''POA''') or '''letter of attorney''' is a written authorization to represent or act on another's behalf in private affairs, business, or some other legal matter. The person authorizing the other to act is the ''principal'', ''grantor'', or ''donor'' (of the power). The one authorized to act is the ''[[agency (law)|agent]]''&lt;ref&gt;Under Louisiana state law only, the agent is referred to as a "mandatary".  See [http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=110025 Louisiana Civil Code Art. 2989]&lt;/ref&gt; or, in some [[common law]] jurisdictions, the '''attorney-in-fact'''.

Formerly, the term "power" referred to an [[legal instrument|instrument]] signed under [[Seal (contract law)|seal]] while a "letter" was an instrument under hand, meaning that it was simply signed by the parties, but today a power of attorney need not be signed under seal. Some jurisdictions require that powers of attorney be notarized or witnessed, but others will enforce a power of attorney as long as it is signed by the grantor.

==Attorney-in-fact==
The term ''attorney-in-fact'' is used in many jurisdictions instead of the term ''agent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attorney-in-Fact|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/attorney-in-fact|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That term should be distinguished from the term ''[[attorney at law (United States)|attorney-at-law]]''. In the United States, an attorney-at-law is a [[solicitor]] who is also licensed to be an advocate in a particular jurisdiction. An attorney-in-fact may be a layperson and is authorized to act pursuant to the powers granted by a power of attorney, but may not engage in acts that would constitute the unauthorized practice of law.

In the context of the unincorporated [[reciprocal inter-insurance exchange]] (URIE) the attorney-in-fact is a stakeholder/trustee who takes custody of the subscriber funds placed on deposit with him, and then uses those funds to pay insurance claims. When all the claims are paid, the attorney-in-fact then returns the leftover funds to the subscribers.

The Uniform Power of Attorney Act employs the term ''agent''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/dpoaa/2008_final.htm Uniform Power of Attorney Act, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129080542/http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/dpoaa/2008_final.htm |date=2011-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an agent, an attorney-in-fact is a [[fiduciary]] for the principal, so the law requires an attorney-in-fact to be completely honest with and loyal to the [[Principal (commercial law)|principal]] in their dealings with each other.

Care must be taken when selecting an attorney-in-fact, as some attorneys-in-fact have used their authority to steal the assets of vulnerable individuals such as the elderly (see [[elder abuse]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Michele|title=Remedying Financial Abuse by Agents Under a Power of Attorney for Finances|journal=Marquette Elder’s Advisor|volume=2|issue=4|pages=39-48|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1264&amp;context=elders|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and requirements==

===Capacity of the grantor===
{{Main article|Capacity (law)}}
The person who creates a power of attorney, known as the grantor, can only do so when he/she has the requisite mental capacity. Suppose the grantor loses capacity to grant permission after the power of attorney has been created (for example, from [[Alzheimer's disease]] or a head injury in a car crash); then the power will probably no longer be effective.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}  In some powers of attorney the grantor states that he/she wishes the document to remain in effect even after he/she becomes incapacitated. This type of power is commonly referred to as a [[#Durable power of attorney|durable power of attorney]]. If someone is already incapacitated, it is not possible for that person to execute a valid power. If a person does not have the capacity to execute a power of attorney (and does not already have a durable power in place), often the only way for another party to act on their behalf is to have a court impose a [[conservatorship]] or a [[guardianship]].

===Oral and written===
Depending on the jurisdiction, a power of attorney may be oral and, whether witnessed, will hold up in court, the same as if it were in writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power of Attorney|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/power_of_attorney|publisher=Cornell Legal Information Institute|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some purposes, the law requires a power of attorney to be in writing. Many institutions, such as [[hospital]]s, [[bank]]s and, in the United States, the [[Internal Revenue Service]], require a power of attorney to be in writing before they will honor it, and they will usually keep a duplicate original or a copy for their records. Nursing homes often follow the same practice.

===Equal dignity rule===
The '''equal dignity rule''' is a principle of law that requires an authorization for someone performing certain acts for another person to have been appointed with the same formality as required for the act the representative is going to perform. This means, for example, that if a principal authorizes someone to sell the principal's house or other real property, and the law requires a contract for the sale of real property to be in writing (which is required under the [[Statute of frauds|Statute of Frauds]] in most U.S. jurisdictions), then the authorization for the other person to sign the sales contract and deed must be in writing too. Likewise, in common-law jurisdictions other than the U.S., a power of an attorney to execute a [[deed]] (i.e. instrument under seal or executed in presence of two witnesses) must be itself executed as a deed.

===Execution===
In order for a power of attorney to become a legally enforceable document, at a minimum it must be signed and dated by the principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irving|first1=Shae|title=Durable Financial Power of Attorney: How It Works|website=Nolo|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions also require that a power of attorney be witnessed, notarized, or both.&lt;ref name=expertlaw1/&gt; Even when not required, having the document reviewed and signed (and often stamped) by a [[notary public]] may increase the likelihood of withstanding a legal challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preventing Challenges to Your Power of Attorney|url=http://www.agis.com/Document/470/preventing-challenges-to-your-financial-power-of-attorney.aspx|publisher=AssistGuide Information Services|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the attorney-in-fact is being paid to act on behalf of the principal, a [[contract]] for payment may be separate from the document granting power of attorney. If that separate contract is in writing, as a separate document it may be kept private between the principal and agent even when the power of attorney is presented to others for the purposes of carrying out the agent's duties.

==Types== &lt;!-- The article [[Right to die]] links to this heading --&gt;
A power of attorney may be: ''special'' (also called ''limited''), ''general'', or ''temporary''. A special power of attorney is one that is limited to a specified act or type of act. A general power of attorney is one that allows the agent to make all personal and business decisions&lt;ref name=ppl&gt;{{cite web|title=Powers of Attorney|url=http://www.peoples-law.org/node/739|publisher=People's Law Library|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Power of Attorney vs. Special Power of Attorney|url=https://www.rocketlawyer.com/article/general-and-special-power-of-attorney-documents--important-differences.rl|publisher=RocketLawyer|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A temporary power of attorney is one with a limited time frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Temporary Power of Attorney|url=http://oregonlawhelp.org/resource/temporary-power-of-attorney?ref=97xzj|publisher=oregonlawhelp.org|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ever required, a durable power of attorney can be revoked or changed as long as the principal is still mentally competent to act.

===Durable===
Under the common law, a power of attorney becomes ineffective if its grantor dies or becomes "incapacitated," meaning unable to grant such a power, because of physical injury or [[mental illness]], for example, unless the grantor (or principal) specifies that the power of attorney will continue to be effective even if the grantor becomes incapacitated. This type of power of attorney is called "power of attorney with durable provisions" in the United States or "[[enduring power of attorney]]" elsewhere. In effect, under a durable power of attorney (DPA), the authority of the attorney-in-fact to act and/or make decisions on behalf of the grantor continues until the grantor's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Elias|title=Gratuitous Transfers: Wills, Intestate Succession, Trusts, Gifts, Future Interests, and Estate and Gift Taxation|year=2007|publisher=Thomson/West|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=978-0-314-16040-9|pages=310|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
In some jurisdictions, a durable power of attorney can also be a "health care power of attorney."  This particular affidavit gives the attorney-in-fact the authority to make health-care decisions for the grantor, up to and including terminating care and life support. The grantor can typically modify or restrict the powers of the agent to make end-of-life decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ksbar.org/public/public_resources/pamphlets/living_wills.shtml |publisher=Kansas Bar Association |title=Living Wills And The Durable Power Of attorney For Health Care |accessdate=2008-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many jurisdictions a health care power of attorney is also referred to as a "[[health care proxy]]" and, as such, the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=expertlaw1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How a Power of Attorney Works|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/estate_planning/power_of_attorney.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|publisher=ExpertLaw|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relationship with advance health care directive====
Related to the health care power of attorney is a separate document known as an [[advance health care directive]], also called a "living will". A [[living will]] is a written statement of a person's health care and medical wishes but does not appoint another person to make health care decisions. Depending upon the jurisdiction, a health care power of attorney may or may not appear with an advance health care directive in a single, physical document. For example, the California legislature has adopted a standard power of attorney for health care and advance health care directive form that meets all of that state's legal wording requirements for a power of attorney and advance health care directive in a single document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Elias|title=Gratuitous Transfers: Wills, Intestate Succession, Trusts, Gifts, Future Interests, and Estate and Gift Taxation|year=2007|publisher=Thomson/West|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=978-0-314-16040-9|pages=311|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare this to New York State, which enacted a Health Care Proxy law that requires a separate document be prepared appointing one as your health care agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New York Code, Public Health Law, Sec. 2981|publisher=State of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Springing===
In some U.S. states and other jurisdictions, it is possible to grant a ''springing power of attorney''; i.e., a power that takes effect only after the incapacity of the grantor or some other definite future act or circumstance.&lt;ref name=ppl /&gt; After such incapacitation the power is identical to a durable power, but cannot be invoked before the incapacity. This power may be used to allow a spouse or family member to manage the grantor's affairs in case illness or injury makes the grantor unable to act.&lt;ref name=spring&gt;{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=Financial Power of Attorney|url=http://www.aarp.org/relationships/caregiving-resource-center/info-11-2010/lfm_financial_power_of_attorney.html|publisher=AARP|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a ''springing'' power is used, the grantor should specify exactly how and when the power ''springs'' into effect. As the result of [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|privacy legislation in the U.S.]], medical doctors will often not reveal information relating to capacity of the principal unless the power of attorney specifically authorizes them to do so.

Determining whether the principal is "disabled" enough to initiate this type of representation is a formal process. Springing powers of attorney are not automatic, and institutions may refuse to work with the attorney-in-fact. Disputes are then resolved in court.

Unless the power of attorney has been made irrevocable by its own terms or by some legal principle, the grantor may revoke the power of attorney by telling the attorney-in-fact it is revoked.  However, if the principal does not inform third parties and it is reasonable for the third parties to rely upon the power of attorney being in force, the principal might still be bound by the acts of the agent, though the agent may also be liable for such unauthorized acts.

===Standardized forms===
Standardized forms are available for various kinds of powers of attorney, and many organizations provide them for their clients, customers, patients, employees, or members.  However, the grantor should exercise caution when using a standardized POA form obtained from a source other than a lawyer because there is considerable variation in approved formats among the states.&lt;ref name=expertlaw1/&gt; In some states statutory power of attorney forms are available. Examples include the [http://www.ssrplaw.com/files/ca_stautory_pofa.pdf California Statutory Form Power of Attorney], [http://easternabstractny.com/pdf/POA-new.PDF New York Form Power of Attorney] and [http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/forms/advdirectives/F00036.pdf Wisconsin Form Power of Attorney].

==Implied limitations on agent's power==
Although a power of attorney grants the agent powers to perform acts in the absence of the grantor, the POA cannot grant powers to the agent that conflict with rules and regulations governing people and companies that the agent deals with.  For example, if a bank has regulations that require the grantor to be physically present in the bank to perform certain actions, the POA cannot grant the agent power to perform those actions in the absence of the grantor.

==Specialized uses==

===Proxy voting===
[[Robert's Rules of Order]] notes that [[proxy voting]] involves granting a power of attorney. The term "proxy" refers to both the power of attorney itself and the person to whom it is granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite parl|title = RONR|edition = 11th|year = 2011|pages = 428}}(RONR)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finance===
In financial situations wherein a principal requests a securities broker to perform extensive investment functions on the principal's behalf, independent of the principal's advice, power of attorney must be formally granted to the broker to trade in the principal's account. This rule also applies to principals who instruct their brokers to perform certain specific trades and principals who trust their brokers to perform certain trades in the principal's best interest.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Legal status by country==
=== Australia ===
In Australia, anyone with capacity can grant a power of attorney.  This can be done either for a pre-defined period of time, or in perpetuity ("enduring").  The power of attorney can be granted to one individual, or to multiple individuals.  When granted to multiple individuals, they may be authorised either to act jointly (all together) or to act severally (each can act individually).  

===England and Wales===
In English and Welsh law, anyone with capacity can grant a power of attorney. These can be general (i.e., to do anything which can legally be done by an attorney), or relate to a specific act (e.g., to sell freehold property). A power of attorney is only valid while the donor has the capacity to ratify the attorney's actions, unless it is made in the form of a [[lasting power of attorney]] and registered with the [[Office of the Public Guardian (England and Wales)|Office of the Public Guardian]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} This new form of power of attorney was introduced in 2007 under the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]] and replaced the former [[enduring power of attorney]], although EPAs correctly made before the law changed are still valid. EPAs only need to be registered if the donor has since lost capacity.

The [[Office of the Public Guardian (England and Wales)|Office of the Public Guardian]] provides online process for registering power of attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Make a lasting power of attorney|url=https://www.lastingpowerofattorney.service.gov.uk/home|website=Gov.UK|publisher=U.K. Government Digital Service|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the provisions in the earlier paragraphs above use terminology different from either common UK usage or terms used in the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]]. Examples are enduring power of attorney, advance directive, and notary public.

===Republic of Ireland===
In Irish law there are two forms of power of attorney:
*Power of attorney, which may be general or specific, which ceases once the donor becomes incapacitated&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/before_a_death/power_of_attorney.html|title=Power of Attorney|accessdate=27 February 2017}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)] license.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Enduring power of attorney, which takes effect once the donor is incapacitated&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;
The death of the donor ends both.&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;

The relevant legislation is the Powers of Attorney Act 1996 and the Enduring Powers of Attorney Regulations 1996 (SI No. 196/1996) as amended by [[Statutory Instrument|SI]] No. 287/1996.&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt; Part 7 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides for new arrangements for those who wish to make an Enduring Power of Attorney and once the 2015 act is commenced, no new powers of attorney will be created under the 1996 act.&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;

====Creating powers of attorney====
A solicitor is not necessary when creating Power of Attorney - it can be created when signed by the donor in the presence of a witness.&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;

Creating an Enduring Power of Attorney requires the following:
*it must be in a particular format&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;
*a statement from a doctor stating that the doctor thought the donor had the mental capacity to understand the effect of creating the power of attorney when the document was executed&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;
*a statement from the donor to say that they understood the effect of creating the power&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;
*a statement from a solicitor to say they are satisfied that the donor understood the effect of creating the power of attorney&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;
*a statement from a solicitor to say the donor was not acting under undue influence&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;

The courts play a general supervisory role in the implementation of the power.&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;

===Russia===
Under Russian law, specifically art. 185 of the Russian Civil Code, a power of attorney may be executed under hand or in notarial form.&lt;ref name="base.garant.ru"&gt;[http://base.garant.ru/10164072/10/#1010 See the Civil Code of Russian Federation (in Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt; The power of attorney to act must be notarially executed. Notarial execution is required for any power of attorney made for concluding a contract subject to special public recordation, namely those dealing with interests in immovable property.&lt;ref&gt;See Section 16 of Act 122 of 200З "On state registration of interests in immovable property and related transactions" (in Russian) [http://base.garant.ru/11901341/3/]&lt;/ref&gt;

A power of attorney, pursuant to art. 186 of the Russian Civil Code, must also be dated.&lt;ref name="base.garant.ru"/&gt; Any POA without an express date of execution is void.

;''[[Predstavitelstvo]]'', ''[[:ru:Доверенность|Doverennost]]'' {{ru icon}}
A power of attorney cannot be irrevocable. The grantor may terminate the POA at any time at his or her sole discretion. Any waiver of this right is void, as provided by the Civil Code.

===Scotland===
The Office of the Public Guardian in Scotland offers the eAttorney Electronic Power of Attorney (EPOAR) system for the submission and payment of powers of attorney registrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How do I make a submission?|url=http://www.publicguardian-scotland.gov.uk/power-of-attorney/epoar/submitting-a-power-of-attorney|website=Office of the Public Guardian (Scotland)|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6474">'''Slap Software''', (Software Livre da Administração Processual, or Free Software of the Procedural Management), is a [[Brazil]]ian [[Open-source software|open source]] system. It was developed to be used in the automation of [[Judicial power|judicial]], [[Public management|administrative]] and [[Legislative procedure|legislative]] [[Procedural law|procedures]]. It is registered in National Industrial Property Institute (INPI).&lt;ref name="INPI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revistas.inpi.gov.br/pdf/PATENTES2039.pdf|title=Patents - Revista da Propriedade Industrial nº 2039|date=2 February 2010|publisher=Revista do Instituto Nacional de Propriedade Industrial|accessdate= 21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Application software|applications]] deal with systems with features of research, control, follow-up and the storing of [[data (computing)|data]], including judicial automation, digital procedure, [[electronic process of law]], or protocol.

== Purpose ==
Slap Software was created mainly to reduce government spending by the [[code reuse|reuse]] of [[Modular programming|module]]s in different parts of government.

It was intended to eliminate the institutional waste that comes reimplementing existing functionality.&lt;ref name="TJMT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tjmt.myclipp.inf.br/file/pdf/dodia/2011Jul05_noticias.pdf|title=Sistema Privado é Melhor para Virtualizar a Justiça|author=Tribunal de Justiça do Mato Grosso|date=5 July 2011|publisher=Myclipp|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another purpose was to help improve best practices in the interdisciplinary area between [[law]] and information technology.

== Concepts ==
Modules were tasked with meeting the requirements of multiple applications in judicial, administrative and legislative domains in both [[Civil procedure|civil]] and [[Criminal procedure|criminal]]),eareas, across [[jurisdiction]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, departments and special courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mauricio.bastos.nom.br/processo-eletronico/9887-slapsoftware-voce-ja-ouviu-falar.html|title=Slap Software, Alguém Já Ouviu Falar?|publisher=Maurício Bastos Juiz do Trabalho|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[modular programming|Modularization]] and reuse are fundamental concepts along with [[object-oriented programming|object-orientation]], [[Component-oriented programming|component-orientation]] and data independence.&lt;ref name="ERGUES"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://erguesdajustica.blogspot.com.br/2009_10_01_archive.html|title=E Viva o Process Digital|date=13 October 2009|publisher=Ergues da Justiça a Clava Forte|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modules ==
The Slap Software talks about formal elements, such as a [[Computer-aided software engineering|case]] would: example applications, documentations [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] and handbooks directed to all the spectrum of its public.

== Community ==
The software is able to interact with media,&lt;ref name="TN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribunadonorte.com.br/print.php?not_id=129521|title=Juiz Desenvolve Projeto para Administrações Públicas|date=27 October 2009|publisher=Tribuna do Norte|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.correiodatarde.com.br/editorias/correio_natal-49234|title=Juiz Desenvolve Sistema para Integrar Administração PúblicaJuiz |date=3 November 2009|publisher=Correio da Tarde|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with institutions,&lt;ref name="TJRN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tjrn.jus.br:8080/sitetj/GerenciadorServlet.do?action=GerenciadorWeb&amp;operacao=exibirInternet&amp;id=4681&amp;secaoSelecionada_id=9&amp;registrarLeitura=true|title=Juiz Desenvolve Sistema para Integrar Administração Pública|date=28 October 2009|publisher=Tribunal de Justiça do Rio Grande do Norte|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AMARN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amarn.com.br/_resources/files/_modules/publicacao/publicacao_92_20091120125955bc16.pdf|title=Boletim Eletrônico Amarn|date=7 November 2009|publisher=Associação dos Magistrados do Rio Grande do Norte|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social network service|social network]]s and other tools.

== History ==
Slapsoftware was started in January 2008,{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} and continues to evolve. The project was shown in lectures&lt;ref name="RORFOCO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roraimaemfoco.com/colunistas/geral-mainmenu-45/4737-informatiza-do-poder-judicio-serema-de-palestra-durante-encontro-de-magistrados.html|title=Informatização do Poder Judiciário será Tema de Palestra Durante Encontro de Magistrados|publisher=Roraima em Foco|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studied by interested students,  executive and staff members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8126">The '''Synod of Bishops for the Pan-Amazon region''' is scheduled to meet in Rome in October 2019. [[Pope Francis]] announced on 15 October 2017 that it would work "to identify new paths for the evangelization of God's people in that region", specifically the [[indigenous peoples]] who are experiencing the destruction and exploitation of their natural environment and live "often forgotten and without the prospect of a serene future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galleazzi|first1=Giacomo|title=A Synod for the indigenous peoples of South America|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2017/10/15/vaticaninsider/eng/world-news/a-synod-for-the-indigenous-peoples-of-south-america-bu6BcrTX8a4HWl645ztM6O/pagina.html|accessdate=23 October 2017|work=La Stampa|date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The obstacles to evangelization include the difficult terrain that makes native populations hard to reach,&lt;ref name=wantssynod /&gt; the great variety of languages spoken, and the resistance of landowners and business interests. The [[Amazon basin|Amazon]], according to one Vatican report, covers six million sq.km. with a population of 2.8 million organized into 400 tribes that "speak some 240 languages belonging to 49 linguistic families".&lt;ref name=repam /&gt; The Synod defines the region to include all or part of [[Religion in Bolivia|Bolivia]], [[Religion in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Religion in Colombia|Colombia]], [[Religion in Ecuador|Ecuador]], [[Religion in French Guiana|French Guiana]], [[Religion in Guyana|Guyana]], [[Religion in Peru|Peru]], [[Religion in Venezuela|Venezuela]], and [[Religion in Surinam|Surinam]], all countries where most of the population is Catholic.&lt;ref name=cruxannounce&gt;{{cite news|last1=San Martín|first1=Inés|title=Pope announces Synod of Bishops for Pan-Amazon region| url=https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2017/10/15/pope-announces-synod-bishops-pan-amazon-region/|accessdate=23 October 2017| work=Crux|date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope John Paul II]] called similar synods for the [[Catholicism in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] in 1980 and for [[Catholicism in Lebanon|Lebanon]] in 1995.&lt;ref name=cruxannounce /&gt;

== Background ==

Visiting Brazil in July 2013, Pope Francis said: "The Church's presence in the Amazon Basin is not that of someone with bags packed and ready to leave after having exploited everything possible. The Church has been present in the Amazon Basin from the beginning, in her [[missionaries]], [[Congregation (Catholic)|religious congregations]], [[priests]], [[laity]] and [[bishops]], and she is still present and critical to the area's future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pope Francis calls for 'respect and protection' of environment, end to exploitation of Amazon rainforest| url=http://nationalpost.com/holy-post/pope-francis-calls-for-respect-and-protection-of-environment-end-to-exploitation-of-amazon-rainforest |accessdate=23 October 2017|work=National Post|date=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Francis' encyclical, ''[[Laudato si'|Laudato si{{'}}]]'' (2015), focused on the need to defend of the poor and their natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Guardian view on Laudato Si': Pope Francis calls for a cultural revolution| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/18/guardian-view-on-laudato-si-pope-francis-cultural-revolution|accessdate=23 October 2017| work=The Guardian|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since March 2015, the Pan-Amazon Ecclesial Network (REPAM) has coordinated the work of the Catholic Church in the Amazon region, marshaling the work of priests and missionaries, national representatives of [[Caritas Internationalis|Caritas]] and lay advocates to protect the both indigenous peoples of the Amazon and the [[natural resources]] of the region from exploitation.&lt;ref name=repam&gt;{{cite news | work= Zenit | accessdate = 23 October 2017 | date = 2 March 2015 | title= Vatican Presents Initiative to Protect Amazon | url = https://zenit.org/articles/vatican-presents-initiative-to-protect-amazon/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop Salvador Pineiro García-Calderón of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ayacucho|Ayacucho]], President of the Peruvian Bishops' Conference, reported that Pope Francis proposed a synod devoted to the Amazon region in a meeting with the bishops of Peru in May 2017.&lt;ref name=wantssynod&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arocho Esteves|first1=Junno|title=Pope Francis wants synod dedicated to people in Amazon, archbishop says| url=https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2017/05/16/pope-francis-wants-synod-dedicated-people-amazon-archbishop-says|accessdate=23 October 2017|work=America|agency=Catholic News Service |date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned it to the bishops of Ecuador in September 2017.&lt;ref name=ecuador&gt;{{cite news | work = Zenit | accessdate = 23 October 2017 | date= 28 September 2017 | url = https://zenit.org/articles/ecuador-pope-encourages-organizing-synod-on-the-church-in-amazonia/ | title = Ecuador: Pope Encourages Organizing Synod on the Church in Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis visited Peru in January 2018 and was met by 4,000 members of the indigenous communities from the [[Amazon rainforest]]. He said that the people of the Amazon were threatened now more than ever, and questioned the conservationist policies that affect the Peruvian rainforest. In [[Puerto Maldonado]], he asked for the indigenous communities to be recognized as partners instead of minorities. He said that "all the efforts we make in order to regain the life of the peoples of the Amazon will always be too few". He called on the Peruvian people to put an end to practices that degrade women and criticized the sterilization of indigenous women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://aa.com.tr/en/americas/pope-francis-visit-to-chile-and-peru-comes-to-an-end/1038139 |title=Pope Francis' visit to Chile and Peru comes to an end |access-date= 8 June 2018 |last= Serna Duque |first=Santiago |date=22 January 2018 |work= |publisher=Anadolu Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2018/01/19/peru-pope-francis-says-church-stands-peoples-amazon-and-earth | first = Gerard | last= O'Connell | accessdate = 8 June 2018 | date= 19 January 2018 |title=In Peru, Pope Francis says the church stands with the peoples of the Amazon and the earth | work = [[America (magazine)|America]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Too Big to Fail''''' is an American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama]] [[television film]] first broadcast on [[Home Box Office|HBO]] on May 23, 2011 based on [[Andrew Ross Sorkin]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Too Big to Fail: The Inside Story of How Wall Street and Washington Fought to Save the Financial System—and Themselves]]'' (2009). The film was directed by [[Curtis Hanson]]. It received 11 nominations at the [[63rd Primetime Emmy Awards#Most nominated shows|63rd Primetime Emmy Awards]]; [[Paul Giamatti]]'s portrayal of [[Ben Bernanke]] earned him the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie]] at the [[18th Screen Actors Guild Awards]].

==Plot summary==
''Too Big to Fail'' chronicles the [[Late-2000s financial crisis#Credit markets and the shadow banking system|2008 financial meltdown]], focusing on the actions of [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Secretary]] [[Henry Paulson]] ([[William Hurt]]) and [[Ben Bernanke]] ([[Paul Giamatti]]), Chairman of the [[Federal Reserve System]], to contain the problems during the period of August 2008 to October 13, 2008. The film starts with clips of news reports about the mortgage industry crisis and the forced sale of the troubled [[Bear Stearns]] to [[JPMorgan Chase]], with Fed guarantees.

With Bear Stearns out of the picture, [[Short (finance)|short sellers]] have turned their attention on [[Lehman Brothers]]. In need of capital, CEO [[Dick Fuld]] ([[James Woods]]) reluctantly fires COO Joe Gregory and CFO Erin Callan, naming Bart McDade as the new President and COO. McDade negotiates a deal with Korean investors, but the deal falls through when Fuld interrupts the negotiations and tries to convince the Koreans that they are undervaluing the [[Toxic asset|toxic]] real estate assets.

Paulson is adamant that the government will not subsidize any more acquisitions, but it becomes clear the most promising buyer for Lehman, [[Bank of America]], is uninterested without Fed involvement. Paulson and [[President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] [[Timothy Geithner]] ([[Billy Crudup]]) gather the leaders of the biggest banks, including [[Goldman Sachs]] CEO [[Lloyd Blankfein]] ([[Evan Handler]]), [[JPMorgan Chase]] CEO [[Jamie Dimon]] ([[Bill Pullman]]), and [[Morgan Stanley]] CEO [[John J. Mack|John Mack]] ([[Tony Shaloub]]), to convince them to underwrite the deal themselves. During a break in negotiations, another threatened firm, [[Merrill Lynch]], approaches Bank of America to buy them instead, which Paulson tacitly okays. With Bank of America purchasing Merrill Lynch, the only other buyer is British firm [[Barclays]], but their involvement is blocked by [[Financial Services Authority|British banking regulators]]. Lehman collapses and is forced into [[bankruptcy]]. Meanwhile, insurance firm [[AIG]] also begins to fail.

Lehman's collapse affects the entire financial market, and the stock market goes into freefall. Blankfein, Mack, and [[General Electric]] CEO [[Jeffrey Immelt]] inform Paulson they are unable to do business, and [[Minister of the Economy, Finances and Industry (France)|French Finance Minister]] [[Christine Lagarde]] warns him that he must not allow AIG to fail. Unlike Lehman, the Treasury rescues AIG with an $85 billion loan.

Bernanke argues that the [[United States Congress|Congress]] must pass legislation to authorize any continued intervention by the Fed or the Treasury. With the availability of [[credit (finance)|credit]] drying up, Paulson's plan is to buy the toxic assets from the banks to take the risk off their books and increase their cash reserves. Bernanke and Paulson lobby Congress, with Bernanke emphasizing the potential of fallout worse than the [[Great Depression]] if they fail to act. Paulson threatens [[U.S. Senator]] and Presidential candidate [[John McCain]] not to interfere and begs [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] not to back away from the negotiations. After a wave of panic and personal haranguing from [[U.S. President|President]] [[George W. Bush]], the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|legislation passes]] on a second attempt and the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP) is created.

Paulson's team realizes that buying toxic assets will take too long, leaving direct capital injects into the banks as their only option to use TARP get credit flowing again. Along with [[FDIC]] Chair [[Sheila Bair]], Paulson informs the banks that they will receive mandatory capital injections. The banks eventually agree, but Paulson's staff laments that the parties who caused the crisis are being allowed to dictate the terms of how they should use the billions with which they are being bailed out. An epilogue notes that bank mergers continued in the wake of the crisis, and that now only ten financial institutions hold 77% of all U.S. banking assets and have been declared [[too big to fail]].

A '''trade union''', also called a '''labour union''' or '''labor union''' ([[American English|US]]), is an [[Political organisation#Labour unions|organization of workers]] who have come together to achieve many common goals, such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, and attaining better wages, benefits (such as vacation, health care, and retirement), and [[working conditions]] through the increased bargaining power wielded by the creation of a monopoly of the workers.&lt;ref name=Union_Anti-Trust_Clayton_Act_Exemption&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2885&amp;context=californialawreview | title=Labor's Antitrust Exemption | last=Frost | first=Daniel | publisher=California Law Review | date=1 April 1967 | accessdate=2017-12-15 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216003433/http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2885&amp;context=californialawreview | archive-date=2017-12-16 | dead-url=no | pages= | quote=&lt;blockquote&gt;...the United States Supreme Court again undertook the delicate task of defining the antitrust exemption granted labor unions by section six of the Clayton Act.&lt;/blockquote&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members ([[wikt:rank and file|rank and file]] members) and negotiates [[Labour and employment law|labour contracts]] ([[collective bargaining]]) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is "maintaining or improving the conditions of their [[employment]]".&lt;ref name="webb"&gt;{{cite book |last=Webb |first=Sidney |last2=Webb|first2= Beatrice |title=History of Trade Unionism |publisher=Longmans and Co. London |year=1920}} ch. I&lt;/ref&gt; This may include the negotiation of [[wage]]s, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing and promotion of workers, benefits, [[Occupational safety and health|workplace safety]] and policies.

Unions may organize a particular section of skilled workers ([[craft unionism]]),&lt;ref name="Poole, M. 1986"&gt;Poole, M., 1986. Industrial Relations: Origins and Patterns of National Diversity. London UK: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; a cross-section of workers from various trades ([[general union]]ism), or attempt to organize all workers within a particular industry ([[industrial unionism]]). The agreements negotiated by a union are binding on the rank and file members and the employer and in some cases on other non-member workers. Trade unions traditionally have a constitution which details the governance of their bargaining unit and also have governance at various levels of government depending on the industry that binds them legally to their negotiations and functioning.

Originating in Great Britain, trade unions became popular in many countries during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Trade unions may be composed of individual workers, [[professional]]s, [[Retiree|past workers]], students, [[apprentice]]s or the unemployed. Trade union density, or the percentage of workers belonging to a trade union, is highest in the [[Nordic countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TUD] OECD. Retrieved: 1 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Since the publication of the ''[[History of Trade Unionism]]'' (1894) by [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]], the predominant historical view is that a trade union "is a continuous association of wage earners for the purpose of maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment."&lt;ref name="webb" /&gt; [[Karl Marx]] described trade unions thus: "The value of labour-power constitutes the conscious and explicit foundation of the trade unions, whose importance for the […] working class can scarcely be overestimated. The trade unions aim at nothing less than to prevent the reduction of wages below the level that is traditionally maintained in the various branches of industry. That is to say, they wish to prevent the price of labour-power from falling below its value" (''Capital'' V1, 1867, p.&amp;nbsp;1069).

A modern definition by the Australian Bureau of Statistics states that a trade union is "an organization consisting predominantly of employees, the principal activities of which include the negotiation of rates of pay and conditions of employment for its members."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Trade Union Census |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/0/9FCBBF538897395ACA2570EC001A6CED?OpenDocument |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet historian R.A. Leeson, in ''United we Stand'' (1971), said:
{{quote|Two conflicting views of the trade-union movement strove for ascendancy in the nineteenth century: one the defensive-restrictive guild-craft tradition passed down through journeymen's clubs and friendly societies, ... the other the aggressive-expansionist drive to unite all 'labouring men and women' for a 'different order of things'.}}

Recent historical research by Bob James in ''Craft, Trade or Mystery'' (2001) puts forward the view that trade unions are part of a broader movement of [[benefit society|benefit societies]], which includes medieval guilds, [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], [[independent Order of Odd Fellows|Oddfellows]], [[Friendly Society|friendly societies]], and other [[fraternal organisation|fraternal organizations]].

The 18th century [[economist]] [[Adam Smith]] noted the imbalance in the rights of workers in regards to owners (or "masters"). In ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', [[s:Chapter 8: Of the Wages of Labour|Book I, chapter 8]], Smith wrote:

{{quote|We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combination of masters, though frequently of those of workmen. But whoever imagines, upon this account, that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject. Masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform combination, not to raise the wages of labor above their actual rate[.]

When workers combine, masters ... never cease to call aloud for the assistance of the civil magistrate, and the rigorous execution of those laws which have been enacted with so much severity against the combination of servants, labourers and journeymen.}}

As Smith noted, unions were illegal for many years in most countries, although Smith argued that it should remain illegal to fix wages or prices by employees or employers. There were severe penalties for attempting to organize unions, up to and including execution. Despite this, unions were formed and began to acquire [[political power]], eventually resulting in a body of labour law that not only legalized organizing efforts, but codified the relationship between employers and those employees organized into unions.

==History==
[[File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg|thumb|Early 19th century workplace militancy manifested in the [[Luddism|Luddite riots]], when unemployed workers destroyed labour saving machines]]
The origins of trade unions can be traced back to 18th century Britain, where the [[Industrial Revolution|rapid expansion of industrial society]] then taking place, drew women, children, rural workers and immigrants into the work force in large numbers and in new roles. This pool of unskilled and semi-skilled labour spontaneously organized in fits and starts throughout its beginnings,&lt;ref name="webb"/&gt; and would later be an important arena for the development of trade unions. Trade unions have sometimes been seen as successors to the [[guild]]s of [[medieval Europe]], though the relationship between the two is disputed, as the masters of the guilds employed workers (apprentices and journeymen) who were not allowed to organize.&lt;ref&gt;(1928).

''The Age''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kautsky|first=Karl|title=Trades Unions and Socialism|journal=International Socialist Review |date=April 1901 |volume=1 |issue=10 |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1901/04/unions.htm|accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade unions and collective bargaining were outlawed from no later than the middle of the 14th century when the [[Ordinance of Labourers]] was enacted in the [[Kingdom of England]]. As collective bargaining and early worker unions grew with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the government began to clamp down on what it saw as the danger of popular unrest at the time of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In 1799, the [[Combination Act]] was passed, which banned trade unions and collective bargaining by British workers. Although the unions were subject to often severe repression until 1824, they were already widespread in cities such as [[London]]. Workplace militancy had also manifested itself as [[Luddism]] and had been prominent in struggles such as the [[1820 Rising]] in Scotland, in which 60,000 workers went on a [[general strike]], which was soon crushed. Sympathy for the plight of the workers brought repeal of the acts in 1824, although the [[Combination Act 1825]] severely restricted their activity.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

By the 1810s, the first labour organizations to bring together workers of divergent occupations were formed. Possibly the first such union was the General Union of Trades, also known as the Philanthropic Society, founded in 1818 in [[Manchester]]. The latter name was to hide the organization's real purpose in a time when trade unions were still illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YaBzZXueFFYC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Attempts at General Union|author=G. D. H. Cole|year=2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National general unions===
[[File:London Trades Demonstration.jpg|thumb|upright|Poster issued by the London Trades Council, advertising a demonstration held on 2 June 1873]]
The first attempts at setting up a national [[general union]] were made in the 1820s and 30s. The [[National Association for the Protection of Labour]] was established in 1830 by [[John Doherty (trade unionist)|John Doherty]], after an apparently unsuccessful attempt to create a similar national presence with the National Union of Cotton-spinners. The Association quickly enrolled approximately 150 unions, consisting mostly of textile related unions, but also including mechanics, blacksmiths, and various others. Membership rose to between 10,000 and 20,000 individuals spread across the five counties of [[Lancashire]], [[Cheshire]], [[Derbyshire]], [[Nottinghamshire]] and [[Leicestershire]] within a year.{{Ref|Webb}} To establish awareness and legitimacy, the union started the weekly ''Voice of the People'' publication, having the declared intention "to unite the productive classes of the community in one common bond of union."{{Ref|Webb2}}

In 1834, the [[Welsh People|Welsh]] [[Socialism|socialist]] [[Robert Owen]] established the [[Grand National Consolidated Trades Union]]. The organization attracted a range of socialists from Owenites to revolutionaries and played a part in the protests after the [[Tolpuddle Martyrs]]' case, but soon collapsed.

More permanent trade unions were established from the 1850s, better resourced but often less radical. The [[London Trades Council]] was founded in 1860, and the [[Sheffield Outrages]] spurred the establishment of the [[Trades Union Congress]] in 1868, the first long-lived [[national trade union center]]. By this time, the existence and the demands of the trade unions were becoming accepted by [[liberalism|liberal]] [[middle class]] opinion. In ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1871) [[John Stuart Mill]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If it were possible for the working classes, by combining among themselves, to raise or keep up the general rate of wages, it needs hardly be said that this would be a thing not to be punished, but to be welcomed and rejoiced at. Unfortunately the effect is quite beyond attainment by such means. The multitudes who compose the working class are too numerous and too widely scattered to combine at all, much more to combine effectually. If they could do so, they might doubtless succeed in diminishing the hours of labour, and obtaining the same wages for less work. They would also have a limited power of obtaining, by combination, an increase of general wages at the expense of profits.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1871)[http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/mill/book5/bk5ch10 Book V, Ch.10], para. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Legalization and expansion===
[[File:1912 Lawrence Textile Strike 1.jpg|thumb|Labour union demonstrators held at bay by soldiers during the 1912 [[Lawrence textile strike]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]]]]
Trade unions were finally legalized in 1872, after a ''[[Royal Commission on Trade Unions]]'' in 1867 agreed that the establishment of the organizations was to the advantage of both employers and employees.

This period also saw the growth of trade unions in other industrializing countries, especially the United States, Germany and France.

In the United States, the first effective nationwide labour organization was the [[Knights of Labor]], in 1869, which began to grow after 1880. Legalization occurred slowly as a result of a series of court decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1357701/trade-union|title=Trade union|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions]] began in 1881 as a federation of different unions that did not directly enrol workers. In 1886, it became known as the [[American Federation of Labor]] or AFL.

In Germany the [[Free Association of German Trade Unions]] was formed in 1897 after the [[conservativism|conservative]] [[Anti-Socialist Laws]] of Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] were repealed.

In France, labour organization was illegal until 1884. The Bourse du Travail was founded in 1887 and merged with the Fédération nationale des syndicats (National Federation of Trade Unions) in 1895 to form the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)]].

==Trade Union Prevalence Worldwide==
The prevalence of unions in various countries can be measured by the concept of "union density", which is expressed as a percentage of the total number of workers in a given location who are trade union members.&lt;ref name="ILO Stats"&gt;{{cite web |title=Industrial relations |url=https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/description_IR_EN.pdf |publisher=International Labour Organisation |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trade union density around the world shows great variation.

==Trade unions by country==
===Australia===
Supporters of unions, such as the [[ACTU]] or [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP), often credit trade unions with leading the [[labour movement]] in the early 20th century. This generally sought to end [[child labour]] practices, improve [[worker safety]], increase wages for both union workers and non-union workers, raise the entire society's [[standard of living]], reduce the hours in a work week, provide public education for children, and bring other benefits to [[working class]] families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://actu.com.au/AboutACTU/HistoryoftheACTU/default.aspx History of the ACTU.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121190936/http://www.actu.com.au/AboutACTU/HistoryoftheACTU/default.aspx |date=21 November 2008 }} Australian Council of Trade Unions.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melbourne Trades Hall]] was opened in 1859 with [[Labour council|Trades and Labour Councils]] and [[Trades Hall]]s opening in all cities and most regional towns in the following forty years. During the 1880s [[Trade unions]] developed among [[Sheep shearer|shearers]], [[miner]]s, and [[stevedore]]s (wharf workers), but soon spread to cover almost all [[blue-collar]] jobs. Shortages of labour led to high wages for a prosperous skilled working class, whose unions demanded and got an [[eight-hour day]] and other benefits unheard of in Europe.

[[File:Melbourne eight hour day march-c1900.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eight-hour day]] march circa 1900, outside Parliament House in Spring Street, [[Melbourne]].]]

Australia gained a reputation as "the working man's paradise." Some employers tried to undercut the unions by importing Chinese labour. This produced a reaction which led to all the colonies restricting Chinese and other Asian immigration. This was the foundation of the [[White Australia Policy]]. The "Australian compact", based around centralised industrial arbitration, a degree of government assistance particularly for primary industries, and White Australia, was to continue for many years before gradually dissolving in the second half of the 20th century.

In the 1870s and 1880s, the growing [[Australian labour movement|trade union]] movement began a series of protests against foreign labour. Their arguments were that Asians and Chinese took jobs away from white men, worked for "substandard" wages, lowered working conditions and refused unionisation.&lt;ref name="Markey"&gt;{{cite web

Objections to these arguments came largely from wealthy land owners in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Markey"/&gt; It was argued that without Asiatics to work in the tropical areas of the [[Northern Territory]] and Queensland, the area would have to be abandoned.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these objections to restricting immigration, between 1875 and 1888 all Australian colonies enacted legislation which excluded all further Chinese immigration.&lt;ref name="Griffiths" /&gt; Asian immigrants already residing in the Australian colonies were not expelled and retained the same rights as their Anglo and Southern compatriots.

The [[Barton Government]] which came to power following the first elections to the Commonwealth parliament in 1901 was formed by the [[Protectionist Party]] with the support of the [[Australian Labor Party]]. The support of the Labor Party was contingent upon restricting non-white immigration, reflecting the attitudes of the [[Australian Workers Union]] and other labour organisations at the time, upon whose support the Labor Party was founded.

===Baltic states===
In the Baltic states trade unions were the part of the [[Soviet Union]] trade union system and closely connected with the [[party]] in the state. [[Industrial action]]s were not a part of their activities. After [[1990]] trade unions in the [[Baltic states]] have experienced rapid loss of membership and [[economic power]], while employers’ organisations increased both power and membership. Low financial and organisational capacity caused by declining membership adds to the problem of interest definition, aggregation and [[protection]] in [[negotiations]] with employers’ and state organisations. Even the difference exists in the way of organization trade union and density. Starting from 2008 the union density slightly decrease in [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]. In case of [[Estonia]] this indicator is lower than in [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] but stays stable average 7 percent from total number of [[employment]]&lt;ref&gt;Dvorak, J., Karnite, R., Guogis, A. (2018). The Characteristic Features of Social Dialogue in the Baltics.

===Belgium===
{{Main|List of trade unions in Belgium}}

With 65% of the workers belonging to a union [[Belgium]] is a country with one of the highest percentages of labour union membership. Only the Scandinavian countries have a higher labour union density. The biggest union with around 1.7 million members is the Christian democrat [[Confederation of Christian Trade Unions]] (ACV-CSC) which was founded in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/957/Binnenland/article/detail/1166041/2010/10/05/Aantal-leden-christelijke-vakbond-neemt-jaar-na-jaar-toe.dhtml|title=Aantal leden christelijke vakbond neemt jaar na jaar toe|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the union can be traced back to the "Anti-Socialist Cotton Workers Union" that was founded in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.acv-online.be/acv-online/het-acv/Wie-zijn-we/Geschiedenis/Geschiedenis.html|title=130 jaar ACV-geschiedenis|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second biggest union is the socialist [[General Federation of Belgian Labour]] (ABVV-FGTB) which has a membership of more than 1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlaamsabvv.be/art/pid/13618/Hoeveel-leden-telt-het-ABVV.htm|title=Hoeveel leden telt het ABVV? - Vlaams ABVV - Socialistische vakbond in Vlaanderen - Algemeen Belgisch Vakverbond ABVV|website=www.vlaamsabvv.be|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ABVV-FGTB traces its origins to 1857, when the first Belgian union was founded in [[Ghent]] by a group of [[weaving|weavers]]. The socialist union, in its current form, was founded in 1898. The third 'big' union in Belgium is the liberal [[General Confederation of Liberal Trade Unions of Belgium]] (ACLVB-CGSLB) which is relatively small in comparison to the first two with a little under 290 thousand members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aclvb.be/over-aclvb/structuurkerncijfers/|title=Structuur en kerncijfers van de ACLVB|date=12 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLVB-CGSLB was founded in 1920 in an effort to unite the many small liberal unions. Back then the liberal union was known as the "Nationale Centrale der Liberale Vakbonden van België". In 1930, the ACLVB-CGSLB adopted its current name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aclvb.be/over-aclvb/historiek/|title=Geschiedenis van de ACLVB|date=12 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides these "big three" there is a long list of smaller unions, some more influential then others. These smaller unions tend to specialize in one profession or economic sector. Next to these specialized unions there is also the [[:nl:Neutrale en Onafhankelijke Vakbond|Neutral and Independent Union]] that reject the [[pillarization]] that, according to them, the "big three" represent. There is also a small [[Flanders|Flemish]] nationalist union that exists only in the [[Flemish language|Flemish]]-speaking part of Belgium, called the [[:nl:Vlaamse Solidaire Vakbond|Vlaamse Solidaire Vakbond]]. The last Belgian union worth mentioning is the very small, but highly active anarchist union called the [[:nl:Vrije Bond|Vrije Bond]].

===Canada===
Labour unions have existed in Canada since the early 1800s. There is a record of skilled tradesmen in [[the Maritimes]] having a union organization during the [[War of 1812]]. Canadian unionism had early ties with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. Tradesmen who came from Britain brought traditions of the British trade union movement, and many British unions had branches in Canada. Canadian unionism ties with the United States eventually replaced those with Britain.

Collective bargaining was first recognized in 1945, following a strike by the [[United Auto Workers]] at the [[General Motors]]' plant in [[Oshawa, Ontario]].
Justice [[Ivan Rand]] issued a landmark legal decision following a strike in [[Windsor, Ontario]], involving 17,000 [[Ford]] workers. He granted the union the compulsory check-off of union dues. Rand ruled that all workers in a bargaining unit benefit from a union-negotiated contract. Therefore, he reasoned they must pay union dues, although they do not have to join the union.

The post-[[World War II]] era also saw an increased pattern of unionization in the public service. Teachers, nurses, social workers, professors and cultural workers (those employed in museums, orchestras and art galleries) all sought private-sector collective bargaining rights. The [[Canadian Labour Congress]] was founded in 1956 as the [[national trade union center]] for Canada.

In the 1970s the federal government came under intense pressures to curtail labour cost and inflation. In 1975, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government of [[Pierre Trudeau]] introduced mandatory price and wage controls. Under the new law, wages increases were monitored and those ruled to be unacceptably high were rolled back by the government.

Pressures on unions continued into the 1980s and '90s. Private sector unions faced plant closures in many manufacturing industries and demands to reduce wages and increase productivity. Public sector unions came under attack by federal and provincial governments as they attempted to reduce spending, reduce taxes and balance budgets. Legislation was introduced in many jurisdictions reversing union collective bargaining rights, and many jobs were lost to contractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mapleleafweb.com/old/education/spotlight/issue_51/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727111519/http://www.mapleleafweb.com/old/education/spotlight/issue_51/history.html |archivedate=27 July 2013 |df= }} Retrieved 14 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent domestic unions in Canada include [[ACTRA]], the [[Canadian Union of Postal Workers]], the [[Canadian Union of Public Employees]], the [[Public Service Alliance of Canada]], the [[National Union of Public and General Employees]], and [[Unifor]]. International unions active in Canada include the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]], [[United Automobile Workers]], [[United Food and Commercial Workers]], and [[United Steelworkers]].

===Colombia===

{{Main|Trade unions in Germany}}
Trade unions in Germany have a history reaching back to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German revolution]] in 1848, and still play an important role in the [[Economy of Germany|German economy]] and society.

In India, the Trade Union movement is generally divided on political lines. According to provisional statistics from the Ministry of Labour, trade unions had a combined membership of 24,601,589 in 2002.

A trade union with nearly 2,000,000 members is the Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) which protects the rights of Indian women working in the informal economy.

===Mexico===
Before the 1990s, unions in Mexico had been historically part of a state institutional system. From 1940 until the 1980s, worldwide spread of [[neo-liberalism]] through the [[Washington Consensus]], the Mexican unions did not operate independently, but instead as part of a state institutional system, largely controlled by the ruling party.&lt;ref name="BotzJay01052010"/&gt;

During these 40 years, the primary aim of the labour unions was not to benefit the workers, but to carry out the state's economic policy under their cosy relationship with the ruling party. This economic policy, which peaked in the 1950s and 60s with the so-called "[[Mexican Miracle]]", saw rising incomes and improved standards of living but the primary beneficiaries were the wealthy.&lt;ref name="BotzJay01052010"/&gt;

In the 1980s, Mexico began adhering to Washington Consensus policies, selling off state industries such as railroad and telecommunications to private industries. The new owners had an antagonistic attitude towards unions, which, accustomed to comfortable relationships with the state, were not prepared to fight back. A movement of new unions began to emerge under a more independent model, while the former institutionalized unions had become very corrupt, violent, and led by gangsters. From the 1990s onwards, this new model of independent unions prevailed, a number of them represented by the National Union of Workers / Unión Nacional de Trabajadores.&lt;ref name="BotzJay01052010"&gt;[[Dan La Botz]] ''[http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=5059 U.S.-supported Economics Spurred Mexican Emigration, pt.1]'', interview at ''[[The Real News]]'', 1 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Current old institutions like the Oil Workers Union and the [[National Education Workers' Union]] (''Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación'', or SNTE) are examples of how the use of government benefits are not being applied to improve the quality in the investigation of the use of oil or the basic education in Mexico as long as their leaders show publicly that they are living wealthily. With 1.4 million members, the teachers' union is [[Latin America]]'s largest; half of Mexico's government employees are teachers. It controls school curriculums, and all teacher appointments. Until recently, retiring teachers routinely "gave" their lifelong appointment to a relative or "sell" it for anywhere in between $4,700 and $11,800.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news |title=Mexico Takes On Teachers Over School Control|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323777204578193882792320310?mod=googlenews_wsj|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=21 December 2012|author=Juan Montes|author2=José de Córdoba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scandinavia===
[[File:Striking workers organised in the Norwegian labour union UNIO.JPG|thumb|Workers on strike in Oslo, Norway, 2012]]
Trade unions (Danish: ''Fagforeninger'', Swedish: ''Fackföreningar'') have a long tradition in [[Scandinavia]]n society. Beginning in the mid-19th century, they today have a large impact on the nature of employment and workers' rights in many of the [[Nordic countries]]. One of the largest trade unions in [[Sweden]] is the [[Swedish Confederation of Trade Unions]], (LO, ''Landsorganisationen''), incorporating unions such as the Swedish Metal Workers' Union (''IF Metall'' = ''Industrifacket Metall''), the Swedish Electricians' Union (Svenska Elektrikerförbundet) and the Swedish Municipality Workers' Union (''Svenska Kommunalarbetareförbundet'', abbreviated ''Kommunal''). One of the aims of IF Metall is to transform jobs into "good jobs", also called "developing jobs".&lt;ref&gt;Anders Bruhn, Anders Kjellberg and Åke Sandberg (2013) [http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/files/19441202/Nordic_lights_kapitel_4_Bruhn_Kjellberg_Sandberg_Correct.pdf "A New World of Work Challenging Swedish Unions"] in Åke Sandberg (ed.) ''Nordic Lights. Work, Management and Welfare in Scandinavia''. Stockholm: SNS (pp. 155-160)&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the world's highest rates of union membership are in the [[Scandinavia]]n countries. In 2010, the percentage of workers belonging to a union (labour union density) was 68.3% in Sweden and 54.8% in [[Norway]], while it was 34.9% in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and 18.4% in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TUD "Trade Union Density"] OECD StatExtracts. 2010.

Moderate [[New Model Union]]s dominated the union movement from the mid-19th century and where trade unionism was stronger than the political labour movement until the formation and growth of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the early years of the 20th century.

Trade unionism in the United Kingdom was a major factor in some of the economic crises during the 1960s and the 1970s, culminating in the "[[Winter of Discontent]]" of late 1978 and early 1979, when a significant percentage of the nation's public sector workers went on strike. By this stage, some 12,000,000 workers in the United Kingdom were trade union members. However, the election of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] led by [[Margaret Thatcher]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|general election]] in May 1979, at the expense of Labour's [[James Callaghan]], saw substantial trade union reform which saw the level of strikes fall. The level of trade union membership also fell sharply in the 1980s, and continued falling for most of the 1990s. The long decline of most of the industries in which manual trade unions were strong&amp;nbsp;– e.g. steel, coal, printing, the docks&amp;nbsp;– was one of the causes of this loss of trade union members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3526917.stm|title=The trade unions' long decline|date=8 March 2004|accessdate=16 January 2014|work=[[BBC News]]|first=Steve|last=Schifferes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 there were 6,135,126 members in TUC-affiliated unions, down from a peak of 12,172,508 in 1980. Trade union density was 14.1% in the private sector and 56.5% in the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=EUROPA|url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/country/united.kingdom_3.htm|title=United Kingdom: Industrial relations profile|date=15 April 2013|accessdate=16 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054931/http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/country/united.kingdom_3.htm|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Labor unions in the United States|Labor history of the United States}}

Labour unions are legally recognized as representatives of workers in many industries in the United States. In the United States, trade unions were formed based on power with the people, not over the people like the government at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kazin|first1=Michael|title=The Populist Persuasion|date=1995|publisher=BasicBooks|page=154|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their activity today centres on [[collective bargaining]] over wages, benefits and working conditions for their membership, and on representing their members in disputes with management over violations of contract provisions. Larger unions also typically engage in lobbying activities and supporting endorsed candidates at the state and federal level.

Most unions in America are aligned with one of two larger umbrella organizations: the [[AFL-CIO]] created in 1955, and the [[Change to Win Federation]] which split from the AFL-CIO in 2005. Both advocate policies and legislation on behalf of workers in the United States and Canada, and take an active role in politics. The AFL-CIO is especially concerned with global trade issues.

In 2010, the percentage of workers belonging to a union in the United States (or total labour union "density") was 11.4%, compared to 18.3% in Japan, 27.5% in Canada and 70% in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TUD Trade Union Density] OECD.

Unions allege that employer-incited opposition has contributed to this decline in membership.

The most prominent unions are among [[public sector]] employees such as teachers, police and other non-managerial or non-executive federal, state, county and municipal employees. Members of unions are disproportionately older, male and residents of the Northeast, the Midwest, and California.&lt;ref name=Yeselson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/103928/not-bang-whimper-the-long-slow-death-spiral-americas-labor-movement|title=Not With a Bang, But a Whimper: The Long, Slow Death Spiral of America’s Labor Movement|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] has asserted that, "Strong unions have helped to reduce inequality, whereas weaker unions have made it easier for [[CEO]]s, sometimes working with market forces that they have helped shape, to increase it." The decline in unionization since the [[Second World War]] in the United States has been associated with a pronounced rise in [[income inequality in the United States|income]] and [[wealth inequality in the United States|wealth inequality]] and, since 1967, with loss of [[American middle class|middle class]] income.&lt;ref&gt;Doree Armstrong (12 February 2014).

Unions may organize a particular section of skilled workers ([[craft unionism]], traditionally found in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US&lt;ref name="Poole, M. 1986"/&gt;), a cross-section of workers from various trades ([[general union]]ism, traditionally found in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Netherlands, the UK and the US), or attempt to organize all workers within a particular industry ([[industrial unionism]], found in Australia, Canada, Germany, Finland, Norway, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US). These unions are often divided into "[[Local union|locals]]", and united in national [[List of federations of trade unions|federations]]. These federations themselves will affiliate with [[International]]s, such as the [[International Trade Union Confederation]]. However, in Japan, union organization is slightly different due to the presence of enterprise unions, i.e. unions that are specific to a specific plant or company. These enterprise unions, however, join industry-wide federations which in turn are members of [[RENGO|Rengo]], the Japanese national trade union confederation.

In [[Western Europe]], professional associations often carry out the functions of a trade union. In these cases, they may be negotiating for white-collar or professional workers, such as physicians, engineers or teachers. Typically such trade unions refrain from politics or pursue a more liberal politics than their blue-collar counterparts.

A '''union''' may acquire the status of a "[[juristic person]]" (an artificial legal entity), with a mandate to negotiate with employers for the workers it represents. In such cases, unions have certain legal rights, most importantly the right to engage in [[collective bargaining]] with the employer (or employers) over wages, working hours, and other [[employment contract|terms and conditions of employment]]. The inability of the parties to reach an agreement may lead to [[industrial action]], culminating in either [[strike action]] or management [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]], or binding arbitration. In extreme cases, violent or illegal activities may develop around these events.

Fox Business. 9 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In other circumstances, unions may not have the legal right to represent workers, or the right may be in question. This lack of status can range from non-recognition of a union to political or criminal prosecution of union activists and members, with many cases of violence and deaths having been recorded historically.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr23/031/2005/en/ Amnesty International report 23 September 2005] – fear for safety of [[SINALTRAINAL]] member José Onofre Esquivel Luna&lt;/ref&gt;

Unions may also engage in broader political or social struggle. [[Social Movement Unionism|Social Unionism]] encompasses many unions that use their organizational strength to advocate for social policies and legislation favourable to their members or to workers in general. As well, unions in some countries are closely aligned with [[political party|political parties]].

Unions are also delineated by the [[service model]] and the [[organizing model]]. The service model union focuses more on maintaining worker rights, providing services, and resolving disputes. Alternately, the organizing model typically involves full-time [[union organizer]]s, who work by building up confidence, strong networks, and leaders within the workforce; and confrontational campaigns involving large numbers of union members. Many unions are a blend of these two philosophies, and the definitions of the models themselves are still debated.

In Britain, the perceived left-leaning nature of trade unions has resulted in the formation of a reactionary right-wing trade union called [[Solidarity&amp;nbsp;– The Union for British Workers|Solidarity]] which is supported by the far-right [[British National Party|BNP]]. In Denmark, there are some newer apolitical "discount" unions who offer a very basic level of services, as opposed to the dominating Danish pattern of extensive services and organizing.&lt;ref&gt;See the website of the Danish discount union "Det faglige Hus" at http://www.detfagligehus.dk/ (website in Danish)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Unison strike rally Oxford 20060328.jpg|thumb|right|A rally of the trade union [[UNISON]] in [[Oxford]] during a strike on 28 March 2006]]
In contrast, in several European countries (e.g. Belgium, Denmark, the [[Netherlands]] and [[Switzerland]]), religious unions have existed for decades. These unions typically distanced themselves from some of the doctrines of orthodox [[Marxism]], such as the preference of atheism and from rhetoric suggesting that employees' interests always are in conflict with those of employers. Some of these Christian unions have had some ties to centrist or conservative political movements and some do not regard strikes as acceptable political means for achieving employees' goals.&lt;ref name="Poole, M. 1986"/&gt; In [[Poland]], the biggest trade union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] emerged as an [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] movement with [[religious nationalism|religious nationalist]] overtones&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxist.com/revolt-polish-workers101001.htm|title=The economic and social processes that led to the revolt of the Polish workers in the early eighties|first=Professor Jacek Tittenbrun of Poznan University,|last=Poland|website=www.marxist.com|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and today it supports the right-wing [[Law and Justice]] party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.money.pl/artykul/solidarnosc;popiera;kaczynskiego;jak;kiedys;walese,177,0,615857.html Solidarność popiera Kaczyńskiego jak kiedyś Wałęsę] at news.money.pl {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although their political structure and autonomy varies widely, union leaderships are usually formed through democratic [[election]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See E McGaughey, 'Democracy or Oligarchy? Models of Union Governance in the UK, Germany and US' (2017) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2995297 ssrn.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Some research, such as that conducted by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acirrt.com/pubs/Trainingwagesupdate.pdf |title=Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training report |publisher=Acirrt.com |accessdate=2011-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722154704/http://www.acirrt.com/pubs/Trainingwagesupdate.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that unionized workers enjoy better conditions and wages than those who are not unionized.

==Shop types==
Companies that employ workers with a union generally operate on one of several models:
* A '''[[closed shop]]''' (US) or a "pre-entry closed shop" (UK) employs only people who are already union members. The compulsory [[hiring hall]] is an example of a closed shop – in this case the employer must recruit directly from the union, as well as the employee working strictly for unionized employers.
* A '''[[union shop]]''' (US) or a "post-entry closed shop" (UK) employs non-union workers as well, but sets a time limit within which new employees must join a union.
* An '''[[agency shop]]''' requires non-union workers to pay a fee to the union for its services in negotiating their contract. This is sometimes called the [[Rand formula]]. In certain situations involving state public employees in the United States, such as [[California]], "fair share laws" make it easy to require these sorts of payments.
* An '''[[open shop]]''' does not require union membership in employing or keeping workers. Where a union is active, workers who do not contribute to a union may include those who approve of the union contract ([[free riders]]) and those who do not. In the United States, state level [[right-to-work law]]s mandate the open shop in some states. In Germany only open shops are legal; that is, all discrimination based on union membership is forbidden. This affects the function and services of the union.

An EU case concerning Italy stated that, "The principle of trade union freedom in the Italian system implies recognition of the right of the individual not to belong to any trade union ("negative" freedom of association/trade union freedom), and the unlawfulness of discrimination liable to cause harm to non-unionized employees."&lt;ref&gt;Eurofound website "FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION/TRADE UNION FREEDOM", {{cite web |url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emire/ITALY/FREEDOMOFASSOCIATIONTRADEUNIONFREEDOM-IT.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417233015/http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emire/ITALY/FREEDOMOFASSOCIATIONTRADEUNIONFREEDOM-IT.htm |archivedate=17 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, previous to this EU jurisprudence, a series of laws introduced during the 1980s by Margaret Thatcher's government restricted closed and union shops. All agreements requiring a worker to join a union are now illegal. In the United States, the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] of 1947 outlawed the closed shop.

In 2006, the European Court of Human Rights found Danish closed-shop agreements to be in breach of Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. It was stressed that Denmark and [[Iceland]] were among a limited number of contracting states that continue to permit the conclusion of closed-shop agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Eurofound, http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/2006/01/feature/dk0601104f.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diversity of international unions==
Union law varies from country to country, as does the function of unions. For example, German and Dutch unions have played a greater role in management decisions through participation in corporate boards and [[co-determination]] than have unions in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bamberg|first=Ulrich|url=http://hesa.etui-rehs.org/uk/newsletter/files/BTS012EN_12-15.pdf|title=The role of German trade unions in the national and European standardisation process|journal=TUTB Newsletter|date=June 2004|volume=24–25|accessdate=27 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726035804/http://hesa.etui-rehs.org/uk/newsletter/files/BTS012EN_12-15.pdf|archivedate=26 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the United States, collective bargaining is most commonly undertaken by unions directly with employers, whereas in Austria, Denmark, Germany or Sweden, unions most often negotiate with employers associations.

Concerning labour market regulation in the EU, Gold (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Gold, M., 1993. ''The Social Dimension – Employment Policy in the European Community''. Basingstroke England UK: Macmillan Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; and Hall (1994)&lt;ref&gt;Hall, M., 1994. ''Industrial Relations and the Social Dimension of European Integration: Before and after Maastricht'', pp. 281–331 in Hyman, R. &amp; Ferner A., eds.: ''New Frontiers in European Industrial Relations'', Basil Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; have identified three distinct systems of labour market regulation, which also influence the role that unions play:
* "In the '''Continental European System''' of labour market regulation, the government plays an important role as there is a strong legislative core of employee rights, which provides the basis for agreements as well as a framework for discord between unions on one side and employers or employers' associations on the other. This model was said to be found in EU core countries such as Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy, and it is also mirrored and emulated to some extent in the institutions of the EU, due to the relative weight that these countries had in the EU until the EU expansion by the inclusion of 10 new [[Eastern Europe]]an member states in 2004.
* In the '''Anglo-Saxon System''' of labour market regulation, the government's legislative role is much more limited, which allows for more issues to be decided between employers and employees and any union or employers' associations which might represent these parties in the decision-making process. However, in these countries, collective agreements are not widespread; only a few businesses and a few sectors of the economy have a strong tradition of finding collective solutions in labour relations. [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the UK belong to this category, and in contrast to the EU core countries above, these countries first joined the EU in 1973.
* In the '''Nordic System''' of labour market regulation, the government's legislative role is limited in the same way as in the Anglo-Saxon system. However, in contrast to the countries in the Anglo-Saxon system category, this is a much more widespread network of collective agreements, which covers most industries and most firms. This model was said to encompass Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Here, Denmark joined the EU in 1973, whereas Finland and Sweden joined in 1995."&lt;ref&gt;Wagtmann, M.A. (2010): Module 3, Maritime &amp; Port Wages, Benefits, Labour Relations. International Maritime Human Resource Management textbook modules. Available at: https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=f90c069a3e6bb729&amp;id=F90C069A3E6BB729%21107#cid=F90C069A3E6BB729&amp;id=F90C069A3E6BB729%21182&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States takes a more [[laissez-faire]] approach, setting some minimum standards but leaving most workers' wages and benefits to collective bargaining and market forces. Thus, it comes closest to the above '''Anglo-Saxon''' model. Also, the Eastern European countries that have recently entered into the EU come closest to the '''Anglo-Saxon''' model.

In contrast, in Germany, the relation between individual employees and employers is considered to be asymmetrical. In consequence, many working conditions are not negotiable due to a strong legal protection of individuals. However, the German flavor or works legislation has as its main objective to create a balance of power between employees organized in unions and employers organized in employers associations. This allows much wider legal boundaries for collective bargaining, compared to the narrow boundaries for individual negotiations. As a condition to obtain the legal status of a trade union, employee associations need to prove that their leverage is strong enough to serve as a counterforce in negotiations with employers. If such an employees association is competing against another union, its leverage may be questioned by unions and then evaluated in a court trial. In Germany, only very few professional associations obtained the right to negotiate salaries and working conditions for their members, notably the medical doctors association Marburger Bund and the pilots association Vereinigung Cockpit. The engineers association [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure]] does not strive to act as a union, as it also represents the interests of engineering businesses.

Beyond the classification listed above, unions' relations with political parties vary. In many countries unions are tightly bonded, or even share leadership, with a political party intended to represent the interests of the working class. Typically this is a [[left-wing]], [[socialist]], or [[social democrat]]ic party, but many exceptions exist, including some of the aforementioned Christian unions.&lt;ref name="Poole, M. 1986" /&gt; In the United States, trade unions are almost always aligned with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] with a few exceptions. For example, the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] has supported [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidates on a number of occasions and the [[Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (1968)|Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization]] (PATCO) endorsed [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980. In Britain trade union movement's relationship with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] frayed as party leadership embarked on [[privatization]] plans at odds with what unions see as the worker's interests. However, it has strengthened once more after the Labour party's election of [[Ed Miliband]], who beat his brother [[David Miliband]] to become leader of the party after Ed secured the trade union votes. Additionally, in the past, there was a group known as the [[Conservative Trade Unionists]], or CTU, formed of people who sympathized with right wing Tory policy but were Trade Unionists.

Historically, the [[Republic of Korea]] has regulated collective bargaining by requiring employers to participate, but collective bargaining has only been legal if held in sessions before the [[Korean New Year|lunar new year]].

==International unionization==
The largest trade union federation in the world is the [[Brussels]]-based [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC), which has approximately 309 affiliated organizations in 156 countries and territories, with a combined membership of 166 million. The ITUC is a federation of national trade union centres, such as the AFL-CIO in the United States and the Trades Union Congress in the United Kingdom. Other global trade union organizations include the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]].

National and regional trade unions organizing in specific industry sectors or occupational groups also form [[global union federation]]s, such as [[Union Network International]], the [[International Transport Workers Federation]], the [[International Federation of Journalists]], the International Arts and Entertainment Alliance or [[Public Services International]].

==Criticisms==
{{Main|Opposition to trade unions}}

In the United States, the outsourcing of labour to Asia, Latin America, and Africa has been partially driven by increasing costs of union partnership, which gives other countries a [[comparative advantage]] in labour, making it more profitable to purchase disorganized, low-wage labour from these regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kramarz |first=Francis |title=Outsourcing, Unions, and Wages: Evidence from data matching imports, firms, and workers |date=19 October 2006|url=http://www.eco.uc3m.es/temp/agenda/wage102006.pdf |accessdate=2007-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milton Friedman]], [[economist]] and advocate of [[laissez-faire capitalism]], sought to show that unionization produces higher wages (for the union members) at the expense of fewer jobs, and that, if some industries are unionized while others are not, wages will tend to decline in non-unionized industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedman|first=Milton|title=Price theory|year=2007|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, NJ|isbn=978-0-202-30969-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EhcI5-D9wREC&amp;pg=PA164|edition=[New ed.], 3rd printing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, several studies have emphasized so-called revitalization strategies where trade unions attempt to better represent labour market outsiders, such as the unemployed and precarious workers. Thus, for instance, trade unions in both Nordic and southern European countries have devised collective bargaining agreements that improved the conditions of temporary agency workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Union inclusiveness and temporary agency workers|last=Vlandas|first=Timothee|last2=Benassi|first2=Chiara|publisher=European Journal of Industrial Relations|year=2016|url=http://ejd.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/06/30/0959680115589485.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Union publications==
Several sources of current news exist about the trade union movement in the world. These include [[LabourStart]] and the official website of the international trade union movement [[Global Unions]]. A source of international news about unions is RadioLabour which provides daily (Monday to Friday) news reports.

''[[Labor Notes]]'' is the largest circulation cross-union publication remaining in the United States. It reports news and analysis about union activity or problems facing the labour movement. Another source of union news is the ''Workers Independent News'', a news organization providing radio articles to independent and syndicated radio shows in the United States.

== Film ==
* The 2010 British film ''[[Made in Dagenham]]'', starring [[Sally Hawkins]], dramatizes the [[Ford sewing machinists strike of 1968]] that aimed for equal pay for women.
* Trade unions were often portrayed in the scripts of [[Jim Allen (playwright)|Jim Allen]].  Examples include ''[[The Big Flame]]'', ''[[The Rank and File]]'' and ''[[Days of Hope]]''.  These films all depict union leaders as untrustworthy and prone to betraying the striking workers.
* The British [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] has been portrayed in numerous films such as ''[[Brassed Off]]'', ''[[Billy Elliot]]'' and ''[[Pride (2014 film)|Pride]]''.
* ''[[Bastard Boys]]'', a 2007 dramatization of the [[1998 Australian waterfront dispute]].

She left school at the age of 15 and married two years later. She and her husband ran a building business together, but the marriage ended in divorce when Cooper was 21.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

She also produces Trelise Cooper Interiors, a fabric range made in association with textiles house [[Charles Parsons (company)|Charles Parsons]].

Cooper's signature fragrance 'Trelise' was launched in late 2009. It was designed by [[perfumer]] Yves Dombrowsky and has been described as an uplifting, positive scent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/beauty/5309834/Secrets-of-a-perfume-wizard|title=Secrets of a perfume wizard|author=Williams, Bronwyn|date=20 July 2011|newspaper=Stuff.co.nz|language=English|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, she became the first New Zealand designer to stage a fashion show on board the [[Queen Mary 2]] cruise ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/travel/news/article.cfm?c_id=7&amp;objectid=10629834|title=Queen Mary 2 arrives in Auckland|work=NZ Herald|date=4 March 2010|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper is a patron of the Breast Cancer Research Trust, an advocate for domestic violence awareness and supports [[Habitat for Humanity]]. At 2009's New Zealand Fashion Week Cooper initiated an onsite house build to promote this charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Page, Emma|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/fashion/2566342/How-to-fashion-a-house|title=How to fashion a house|website=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|date=5 July 2009|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, Cooper was involved in an intellectual property dispute with fellow New Zealand fashion designer [[Tamsin Cooper]], objecting to Tamsin registering her name as a trademark. In July 2007, Cooper agreed to drop the suit and let Tamsin Cooper operate under her own name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scoop.co.nz/stories/BU0707/S00044.htm|title=Cooper and Cooper reach agreement over trade marks|work=[[Scoop (website)|Scoop]]|date=3 July 2007|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wall Street''''' is a 1987 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]], directed and co-written by [[Oliver Stone]], which stars [[Michael Douglas]], [[Charlie Sheen]], and [[Daryl Hannah]]. The film tells the story of Bud Fox (Sheen), a young [[stockbroker]] who becomes involved with [[Gordon Gekko]] (Douglas), a wealthy, unscrupulous [[corporate raid]]er.

Stone made the film as a tribute to his father, Lou Stone, a stockbroker during the [[Great Depression]]. The character of Gekko is said to be a composite of several people, including [[Dennis Levine]], [[Ivan Boesky]], [[Carl Icahn]], [[Asher Edelman]], [[Michael Milken]], and Stone himself. The character of Sir Lawrence Wildman, meanwhile, was modeled on the prominent British financier and corporate raider [[Jimmy Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]]. Originally, the studio wanted [[Warren Beatty]] to play Gekko, but he was not interested; Stone, meanwhile, wanted [[Richard Gere]], but Gere passed on the role.

The film was well received among major film critics. Douglas won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], and the film has come to be seen as the archetypal portrayal of 1980s success, with Douglas' character declaring that "greed is good." It has also proven influential in inspiring people to work on Wall Street, with Sheen, Douglas, and Stone commenting over the years how people still approach them and say that they became stockbrokers because of their respective characters in the film.

Stone and Douglas reunited for a sequel titled ''[[Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps]]'', which was released theatrically on September 24, 2010.

==Plot==
In 1985, Bud Fox is a junior [[stockbroker]] at Jackson Steinem &amp; Co. in [[New York City]]. He wants to work with his hero, [[Gordon Gekko]], a  legendary [[Wall Street]] player. After calling Gekko's office 59 days in a row trying to land an appointment, Bud visits Gekko on his birthday with a box of Gekko's favorite, contraband Cuban cigars. Impressed at his boldness, Gekko grants Bud an interview. Bud pitches him stocks, but Gekko is unimpressed. Desperate, Bud provides him some [[Insider trading|inside information]] about Bluestar Airlines, which he has learned in a casual conversation with his father, Carl, leader of the company's maintenance workers union. Intrigued, Gekko tells Bud he will think about it. A dejected Bud returns to his office. However, Gekko places an order for Bluestar stock and becomes one of Bud's clients. Gekko gives Bud some capital to manage, but the other stocks Bud selects lose money.

Gekko offers Bud another chance, and tells him to spy on British CEO Sir Lawrence Wildman and discern Wildman's next move. Bud learns that Wildman is making a bid for a steel company. Through Bud's spying, Gekko makes money, and Wildman is forced to buy Gekko's shares to complete his takeover.

Bud becomes wealthy, enjoying Gekko's promised perks, including a penthouse on Manhattan's [[Upper East Side]] and a girlfriend, [[Interior decoration|interior decorator]] Darien. Bud is promoted as a result of the large commission fees he is bringing in and is given a [[corner office]] with a view. He continues to maximize inside information and use friends as [[Straw purchase|straw buyers]] to provide more income for him and Gekko. Unknown to Bud, several of his trades attract the attention of the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]].

Bud pitches a new idea to Gekko: buy Bluestar Airlines and expand the company, with Bud as president, using savings achieved by union concessions and the overfunded pension. Even though Bud is unable to persuade his father to support him and Gekko, he is able to get the unions to push for the deal. Soon afterward, Bud learns that Gekko plans to dissolve the company and sell off Bluestar's assets in order to access cash in the company's pension plan, leaving Carl and the entire Bluestar staff unemployed. Although this would leave Bud a very rich man, he is angered by Gekko's deceit and racked with the guilt of being an accessory to Bluestar's impending destruction, especially after his father suffers a heart attack. Bud resolves to disrupt Gekko's plans, and breaks up with Darien when she refuses to go against Gekko, her former lover.

Bud devises a plan to drive up Bluestar's stock before manipulating it back down. He and the other union presidents then secretly meet with Wildman and arrange for him to buy [[controlling interest]] in Bluestar at a significant discount. Gekko, realizing that his stock is plummeting, dumps his remaining interest in the company on Bud's advice. However, when Gekko learns on the evening news that Wildman is buying Bluestar, he realizes that Bud has engineered the entire scheme. Bud triumphantly goes back to work at Jackson Steinem the following day, only to be arrested for insider trading.

Sometime later, Bud confronts Gekko in [[Central Park]]. Gekko physically assaults Bud as he berates him for his role with Bluestar and accuses him of ingratitude for several of their illicit trades. Following the confrontation, it is revealed that Bud was wearing a wire to record his encounter with Gekko. He turns the tapes over to the authorities, who suggest that he may get a lighter sentence in exchange for helping them make a case against Gekko. Later, Bud's parents drive him down [[FDR Drive]] towards the [[New York County Courthouse]] to answer for his crimes.

==Production==
===Development===
After the success of ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986), Stone wanted film school friend and [[Los Angeles]] screenwriter [[Stanley Weiser]] to research and write a screenplay about [[quiz show scandals]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Weiser"&gt;{{cite news |last=Weiser |first=Stanley |title=Repeat After Me: Greed is Not Good |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher= |date=October 5, 2008 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/05/entertainment/ca-wallstreet5 |accessdate=October 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a story conference, Stone suggested making a film about Wall Street instead. The director pitched the premise of two investment partners getting involved in questionable financial dealings, using each other, and they are tailed by a prosecutor as in ''[[Crime and Punishment]]''.&lt;ref name="Weiser"/&gt; The director had been thinking about this kind of a movie as early as 1981&lt;ref name="Riordan"&gt;{{cite news |last=Riordan |first=James |title=Stone: A Biography of Oliver Stone |work= |publisher=Aurum Press |date=September 18, 1996 |url=  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was inspired by his father, Lou Stone, a broker during the [[Great Depression]] at [[Hayden Stone]].&lt;ref name="Demos"&gt;{{cite news |last=Demos |first=Telis |title=Oliver Stone: Life after ''Wall Street'' |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |publisher= |date=September 21, 2007 |url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/09/20/news/newsmakers/oliver_stone.fortune/index.htm |accessdate=December 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filmmaker knew a New York businessman who was making millions and working long days putting together deals all over the world. This man started making mistakes that cost him everything. Stone remembers that the "story frames what happens in my movie, which is basically a ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress|Pilgrim's Progress]]'' of a boy who is seduced and corrupted by the allure of easy money. And in the third act, he sets out to redeem himself".&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt; Stone asked Weiser to read ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', but Weiser found that its story did not mix well with their own. Stone then asked Weiser to read ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' for material that they could use, but it was not the right fit either.&lt;ref name="Weiser"/&gt; Weiser had no prior knowledge of the financial world and immersed himself in researching the world of stock trading, [[junk bond]]s, and corporate takeovers. He and Stone spent three weeks visiting [[brokerage firm|brokerage houses]] and interviewing investors.&lt;ref name="Weiser"/&gt;

===Screenplay===
Weiser wrote the first draft, initially called ''Greed'', with Stone writing another draft. Originally, the lead character was a young Jewish broker named Freddie Goldsmith, but Stone changed it to Bud Fox to avoid the stereotype that Wall Street was controlled by Jews.&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt; Reportedly, Gordon Gekko is said to be a composite of several people: Wall Street broker Owen Morrisey, an old friend of Stone's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lavington|first=Stephen|title=Virgin Film: Oliver Stone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uf6jNxx0ppMC&amp;pg=PT145|year=2011|publisher=Ebury|isbn=9780753547663|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was involved in a $20 million insider trading scandal in 1985, [[Dennis Levine]], [[Ivan Boesky]],&lt;ref name="Crowdus"&gt;{{cite news |last=Crowdus |first=Gary |title=Personal Struggles and Political Issues |work=Cineaste |pages= |publisher= |year=1987 |url=http://www.cineaste.com/articles/stone-interview.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=February 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226194916/http://www.cineaste.com/articles/stone-interview.pdf |archivedate=February 26, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; corporate raider [[Carl Icahn]], [[art collector]] [[Asher Edelman]], agent [[Michael Ovitz]], and Stone himself.&lt;ref name="Weiser"/&gt; For example, the "Greed is good" line was based on a speech by Boesky where he said, "Greed is right".&lt;ref name="Sigesmund"/&gt;

According to [[Edward R. Pressman]], producer of the film, "Originally, there was no one individual who Gekko was modeled on", he adds, "But Gekko was partly [[Michael Milken|Milken]]". Also, Pressman has said that the character of Sir Larry Wildman was modeled on [[James Goldsmith]], the Anglo-French billionaire and corporate-raider.&lt;ref name="Goodley"&gt;{{cite news |last=Goodley |first=Simon |title=Brace Yourself, Gekko is Back |work=[[Daily Telegraph]] |pages= |publisher= |date=October 27, 2008 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2814749/Brace-yourself-Gekko-is-back.html  |accessdate=January 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Weiser, Gekko's style of speaking was inspired by Stone. "When I was writing some of the dialogue I would listen to Oliver on the phone and sometimes he talks very rapid-fire, the way Gordon Gekko does".&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt; Stone cites as influences on his approach to business, the novels of [[Upton Sinclair]], [[Sinclair Lewis]] and [[Victor Hugo]], and the films of [[Paddy Chayefsky]] because they were able to make a complicated subject clear to the audience.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite news |last=Scott |first=Jay |title=Stone Gets Down to Business on ''Wall Street'' |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |pages= |publisher= |date=December 4, 1987 |url=  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone set the film in 1985 because insider trading scandals culminated in 1985 and 1986.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt; This led to anachronisms in the script, including a reference to the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]], which had not yet occurred.

===Casting===
Stone met with [[Tom Cruise]] about playing Bud Fox, but the director had already committed to Charlie Sheen for the role.&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt; Stone liked the "stiffness" of Sheen's acting style and used it to convey Bud's naivete.&lt;ref name="Kiselyak"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kiselyak |first=Charles |title=Money Never Sleeps: The Making of ''Wall Street'' |work=Wall Street: 20th Anniversary Edition DVD |pages= |publisher= [[20th Century Fox]] |year=2007 |url=  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Douglas had just come off heroic roles like the one in ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' and was looking for something dark and edgy.&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt; The studio wanted [[Warren Beatty]] to play Gekko, but he was not interested. Stone initially wanted [[Richard Gere]] but the actor passed, so Stone went with Douglas despite having been advised by others in [[Hollywood]] not to cast him.&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt; Stone remembers, "I was warned by everyone in Hollywood that Michael couldn't act, that he was a producer more than an actor and would spend all his time in his trailer on the phone". Nevertheless, Stone found out that "when he's acting he gives it his all".&lt;ref name="McGuigan, Cathleen"&gt;{{cite news |last=McGuigan |first=Cathleen |title=A Bull Market in Sin |work=[[Newsweek]] |pages= |publisher= |date=December 14, 1987 |url=  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone said that he saw "that villain quality" in Douglas and always thought he was a smart businessman.&lt;ref name="Lipper"/&gt; Douglas remembers that when he first read the screenplay, "I thought it was a great part. It was a long script, and there were some incredibly long and intense monologues to open with. I'd never seen a screenplay where there were two or three pages of single-spaced type for a monologue. I thought, whoa! I mean, it was unbelievable".&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt; For research, he read profiles of corporate raiders [[T. Boone Pickens]] and Carl Icahn.&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt;

Stone gave Charlie Sheen the choice of [[Jack Lemmon]] or [[Martin Sheen]] to play his father in the film, and Sheen picked his father. The elder Sheen related to the moral sense of his character.&lt;ref name="Kiselyak"/&gt; Stone cast [[Daryl Hannah]] as Bud Fox's materialistic girlfriend Darien Taylor, but felt that she was never happy with the role and did not know why she accepted it. He tried to explain the character to Hannah repeatedly, and thought that the materialism of the character conflicted with Hannah's idealism.&lt;ref name="Kiselyak"/&gt; Stone said later that he was aware early on that she was not right for the part. "Daryl Hannah was not happy doing the role and I should have let her go. All my crew wanted to get rid of her after one day of shooting. My pride was such that I kept saying I was going to make it work".&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt; Stone also had difficulties with [[Sean Young]], who made her opinions known that Hannah should be fired and that she should play that role instead. Young would show up to the set late and unprepared. She did not get along with Charlie Sheen, which caused further friction on the set. In retrospect, Stone felt that Young was right and he should have swapped Hannah's role with hers.&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt; Stone admits that he had "some problems" with Young, but was not willing to confirm or deny rumors that she walked off with all of her costumes when she completed filming.&lt;ref name="Lipper"/&gt;

===Principal photography===
Stone wanted to shoot the movie in [[New York City]] and that required a budget of at least $15 million, a moderate shooting budget by 1980s standards. The studio that backed ''Platoon'' felt that it was too risky a project to bankroll and passed. Stone and producer [[Edward R. Pressman]] took it to [[20th Century Fox]] and filming began in April 1987 and ended on July 4 of the same year.&lt;ref name="Blair"&gt;{{cite news |last=Blair |first=Cynthia |title=1987: ''Wall Street'' Filmed in New York City |work=[[Newsday]] |pages= |publisher= |year=2008 |url=http://www.newsday.com/other/special/ny-ihiny090904story,0,2269738.htmlstory |accessdate=March 18, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207012006/http://www.newsday.com/other/special/ny-ihiny090904story%2C0%2C2269738.htmlstory |archivedate=December 7, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the film were shot in [[Snowbird, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stone, he was "making a movie about sharks, about feeding frenzies. Bob [director of photography [[Robert Richardson (cinematographer)|Robert Richardson]]] and I wanted the camera to become a predator. There is no letup until you get to the fixed world of Charlie's father, where the stationary camera gives you a sense of immutable values".&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt; The director saw [Wall Street] as a battle zone and "filmed it as such" including shooting conversations like physical confrontations and in ensemble shots had the camera circle the actors "in a way that makes you feel you're in a pool with sharks".&lt;ref name="Wuntch"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wuntch |first=P |title=Stone's War on Wall St |work=Herald |pages= |publisher= |date=December 21, 1987 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffrey "Mad Dog" Beck, a star investment banker at the time with [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]], was one of the film's technical advisers and has a [[cameo appearance]] in the film as the man speaking at the meeting discussing the breakup of Bluestar. [[Kenneth Lipper]], investment banker and former deputy mayor of New York for Finance and Economic Development, was also hired as chief technical adviser.&lt;ref name="Cowan, Alison"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cowan |first=Alison |title=Making ''Wall Street'' Look Like Wall Street |work=[[New York Times]] |pages= |publisher= |date=December 30, 1987 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, he turned Stone down because he felt that the film would be a one-sided attack. Stone asked him to reconsider and Lipper read the script responding with a 13-page critique.&lt;ref name="Welles"&gt;{{cite news |last=Welles |first=Chris |title=The Platoon of Pros Who Helped Out on ''Wall Street'' |work=[[Business Week]] |pages= |publisher= |date=December 21, 1987 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he argued that it was unrealistic to have all the characters be "morally bankrupt".&lt;ref name="Cowan, Alison"/&gt; Lipper advised Stone on the kind of computers used on the trading floor, the accurate proportion of women at a business meeting, and the kinds of extras that should be seated at the annual shareholders meeting where Gekko delivers his "Greed is good" speech.&lt;ref name="Cowan, Alison"/&gt; Stone agreed with Lipper's criticism and asked him to rewrite the script. Lipper brought a balance to the film and this helped Stone get permission to shoot on the floor of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] during trading hours.&lt;ref name="Welles"/&gt; Lipper and Stone disagreed over the character of Lou Mannheim. Stone shot a scene showing the honest Mannheim giving in to insider trading, but Lipper argued that audiences might conclude that everyone on Wall Street is corrupt and insisted that the film needed an unimpeachable character. Stone cut the scene.&lt;ref name="Welles"/&gt;

Stone also consulted with Carl Icahn, Asher Edelman, convicted inside trader [[David Brown (entrepreneur)|David Brown]], several government prosecutors, and Wall Street investment bankers.&lt;ref name="Lipper"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lipper |first=Hal |title=The Stone Age |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |pages= |publisher= |date=December 13, 1987 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, traders were brought in to coach actors on the set on how to hold phones, write out tickets, and talk to clients.&lt;ref name="Welles"/&gt; Stone asked Lipper to design a six-week course that would expose Charlie Sheen to a cross section of young Wall Street business people. The actor said, "I was impressed and very, very respectful of the fact that they could maintain that kind of aggressiveness and drive".&lt;ref name="Rattner"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rattner |first=Steven |title=From Vietnam to ''Wall Street'' |work=[[New York Times]] |pages= |publisher= |date=August 30, 1987 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas worked with a speech instructor on [[Vocal pedagogy|breath control]] in order to become better acclimatized to the fast rhythm of the film's dialogue. Early on in the shoot, Stone tested Douglas by enhancing his "repressed anger", according to the actor.&lt;ref name="Kiselyak"/&gt; At one point, Stone came into Douglas' trailer and asked him if he was doing drugs because "you look like you haven't acted before".&lt;ref name="Kiselyak"/&gt; This shocked Douglas, who did more research and worked on his lines again and again, pushing himself harder than he had before. All of this hard work culminated with the "Greed is good" speech.&lt;ref name="Kiselyak"/&gt; Stone planned to use a ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine cover in exchange for promotional advertisements, but ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine made a similar offer. Stone stuck with ''Fortune'', which upset ''Forbes'' publisher [[Malcolm Forbes]], who turned down a later request to use his private yacht.&lt;ref name="Garcia"&gt;{{cite news |last=Garcia |first=Guy D |title=In the Trenches of Wall Street |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |pages= |publisher= |date=July 20, 1987 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,965026,00.html |accessdate=March 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone switched from 12- to 14-hour shooting days in the last few weeks in order to finish principal photography before an impending [[Directors Guild of America]] strike and finished five days ahead of schedule.&lt;ref name="Garcia"/&gt; Sheen remembered that Stone was always looking at the script and at his watch.&lt;ref name="Kiselyak"/&gt;

The film has come to be seen as the archetypal portrayal of 1980s excess, with Douglas advocating "greed, for lack of a better word, is good".&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ross |first=Brian |title=Greed on Wall Street |work=[[ABC News]] |publisher= |date=November 11, 2005 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=1305010 |accessdate=March 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wall Street'' defines itself through a number of morality conflicts putting wealth and power against simplicity and honesty,&lt;ref name="Gabriel"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gabriel |first=Satya J | title=Oliver Stone's ''Wall Street'' and the Market for Corporate Control |work=Economics in Popular Film (course) |publisher=Mount Holyoke |date=November 21, 2001 |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/sgabriel/filmcourse/oliver_stone.html |accessdate=December 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Staff | title=The Return of Greed | url=http://www.newsweek.com/return-greed-146987 | work=Newsweek | date=July 18, 2002 | accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an attack on the value system of extreme competitiveness where ethics and the law are simply irrelevant parts of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Doyle | first=Jack | title="Greed is Good" speech | url=http://www.pophistorydig.com/topics/tag/greed-is-good-speech/ | work=The Pop History Dig | date=February 4, 2010 | accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl ([[Martin Sheen]]'s character) represents the working class in the film: he is the union leader for the maintenance workers at Bluestar. He constantly attacks big business, money, mandatory drug screening, greedy manufacturers, and anything that he sees as a threat to his union. The conflict between Gekko's relentless pursuit of wealth and Carl Fox's leftward leanings form the basis of the film's subtext.&lt;ref name="Gabriel"/&gt; This subtext could be described as the concept of the two fathers battling for control over the morals of the son, a concept Stone had also used in ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]''. In ''Wall Street'' the hard-working Carl Fox and the cutthroat businessman Gordon Gekko represent the fathers. The producers of the film use Carl as their voice in the film, a voice of reason amid the [[creative destruction]] brought about by Gekko's unrestrained personal philosophy.&lt;ref name="Gabriel"/&gt;

A significant scene in the film is a speech by Gekko to a shareholders' meeting of Teldar Paper, a company he is planning to take over. Stone uses this scene to give Gekko, and by extension, the [[Wall Street]] raiders he personifies, the chance to justify their actions, portraying himself as a liberator of the company value from the ineffective and excessively compensated executives.&lt;ref name="Gabriel"/&gt; The inspiration for the "Greed is good" speech seems to have come from two sources. The first part, where Gekko complains that the company's management owns less than three percent of its stock, and that it has too many vice presidents, is taken from similar speeches and comments made by [[Carl Icahn]] about companies he was trying to take over.&lt;ref name="Gabriel"/&gt; The defense of greed is a paraphrase of the May 18, 1986, commencement address at the [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]]'s School of Business Administration, delivered by arbitrageur [[Ivan Boesky]] (who himself was later convicted of insider trading charges), in which he said, "Greed is all right, by the way. I want you to know that. I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Dickerson | first=John F. | title=Battling Boeskys | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978367,00.html | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=May 3, 1993 | accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/haas/about/commencementspeakers.html | title=Commencement Speakers | publisher=Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley  | accessdate=March 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Wall Street'' is not a wholesale criticism of capitalism, but of the cynical, quick-buck culture of the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Gabriel"/&gt; The "good" characters in the film are themselves capitalists, but in a more steady, hardworking sense. In one scene, Gekko scoffs at Bud Fox's question as to the moral value of hard work, quoting the example of his (Gekko's) father, who worked hard his entire life only to die in debt. Lou Mannheim, the film's archetypal mentor, says early in the film, that "good things sometimes take time", referring to [[IBM]] and [[Hilton Hotels Corporation|Hilton]]—in contrast, Gekko's "Greed is Good" credo typifies the short-term view prevalent in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Gabriel"/&gt;

==Reception==
''Wall Street'' was released on December 11, 1987, in 730 theaters and grossed $4.1 million on its opening weekend. It went on to make $43.8 million in North America.&lt;ref name="boxoffice"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=''Wall Street'' |work=Box Office Mojo |pages= |publisher= |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=wallstreet.htm |accessdate=March 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has a 78% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and a 56 metascore on [[Metacritic]]. In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Vincent Canby]], while quite critical of the film overall, praised Douglas' work as "the funniest, canniest performance of his career".&lt;ref name="Canby, Vincent"&gt;{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |title=Stone's ''Wall Street'' |work=[[The New York Times]] |pages= |publisher= |date=December 11, 1987 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DE6D61E38F932A25751C1A961948260 |accessdate=May 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and praised it for allowing "all the financial wheeling and dealing to seem complicated and convincing, and yet always have it make sense. The movie can be followed by anybody, because the details of stock manipulation are all filtered through transparent layers of greed. Most of the time we know what's going on.

''Wall Street'' enjoyed renewed interest in the film in 1990 when the cover of ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine asked, "Is Greed Dead?" after 1980s icons like [[Michael Milken]] and [[Ivan Boesky]] ran afoul of insider trading laws.&lt;ref name="Demos"/&gt; Over the years, the film's screenwriter Stanley Weiser has been approached by numerous people who told him, "The movie changed my life. Once I saw it I knew that I wanted to get into such and such business. I wanted to be like Gordon Gekko".&lt;ref name="Weiser"/&gt; In addition, both Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas still have people come up to them and say that they became stockbrokers because of their respective characters in the film.&lt;ref name="Kiselyak"/&gt; In recent years, Stone was asked how the financial market depicted in ''Wall Street'' has changed and he replied, "The problems that existed in the 1980s market grew and grew into a much larger phenomenon. [[Enron]] is a fiction, in a sense, in the same way that Gordon Gekko's buying and selling was a fiction ... [[Kenneth Lay|Kenny Lay]]—he's the new Gordon Gekko".&lt;ref name="Sigesmund"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sigesmund |first=B.J |title=The Return of Greed |work=[[Newsweek]] |pages= |publisher=|year=2002 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2002/07/18/the-return-of-greed.html |accessdate=October 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine's [[Owen Gleiberman]] recently commented that the film, "reveals something now which it couldn't back then: that the Gordon Gekkos of the world weren't just getting rich—they were creating an alternate reality that was going to crash down on all of us".&lt;ref name="Gleiberman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |title=''Wall Street'': What it still has to tell us |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |pages= |publisher=|date=March 28, 2009 |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/03/28/a-look-back-at/ |accessdate=April 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 20th-anniversary edition was released on September 18, 2007. New extras include an on-camera introduction by Stone, extensive [[deleted scene]]s, "Greed is Good" featurettes, and interviews with Michael Douglas and Martin Sheen.&lt;ref name="Croce"&gt;{{cite news |last=Croce |first=Fernando F |title=''Wall Street'' |work=Slant |date=September 15, 2007 |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/wall-street-20th-anniversary-edition/1209 |accessdate=December 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505143733/http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/wall-street-20th-anniversary-edition/1209 |archivedate=May 5, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing the film's sequel 23 years later, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted that though the original film was "intended as a cautionary tale on the pitfalls of unchecked ambition and greed, Stone's 1987 original instead had the effect of turning Douglas' hugely charismatic (and Oscar-winning) villain into a household name and boardroom icon -- an inspiration to the very power players and Wall Street wannabes for whom he set such a terrible example".&lt;ref name="Chang0510"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Justin |title=CANNES: Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |pages= |publisher=|date=May 14, 2010 |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117942753.html/ |accessdate=August 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:

==Sequel==
{{main|Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps}}
In 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that a [[sequel]] to ''Wall Street'', to be subtitled ''Money Never Sleeps'', was already in [[pre-production]].&lt;ref name="Siegel"&gt;{{cite news |last=Siegel |first=Tatiana |title=Fox, Loeb up for ''Wall Street'' sequel |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |pages= |publisher= |date=October 13, 2008 |url=http://www.variety.com/VR1117993933.html |accessdate=May 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Douglas would reprise his role as Gordon Gekko. The film would also focus on Gekko, recently released from prison and re-entering a much more chaotic financial world than the one he once oversaw.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt; Charlie Sheen would also reprise his character of Bud Fox, but only in a [[cameo role]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=58916|title=Charlie Sheen to Cameo in ''Wall Street 2''|accessdate=June 17, 2010|date=September 8, 2009|publisher=[[CraveOnline#Film and TV|Coming Soon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daryl Hannah would not be involved in the sequel.&lt;ref name="Michael Cieply"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cieply |first=Michael |title=Film's Wall Street Predator to Make a Comeback |work=[[New York Times]] |pages= |publisher= |date=May 5, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/05/movies/05movi.html?ex=1336017600&amp;en=64f8ac17912072b8&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss |accessdate=May 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=''Wall Street'' sequel 'to be made' |work=[[BBC]] |pages= |publisher= |date=May 5, 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6628101.stm |accessdate=January 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But by April 2009, 20th Century Fox confirmed that the sequel was already in development and announced that Oliver Stone would direct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jay A. |last=Fernandez |authorlink= |author2=Kit, Borys  |title=Oliver Stone in for Fox's ''Wall Street'' follow-up |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i0dac803b1646d6af56ac6bb4d7de236c |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher= |date=April 28, 2009 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Shia LaBeouf]] was cast with [[Josh Brolin]].&lt;ref name="VarFleming"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fleming |first=Michael |title=Stone to walk ''Wall Street'' again |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |pages= |publisher= |date=April 28, 2009 |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002934.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |accessdate=April 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Javier Bardem]] had been considered,&lt;ref name="finke"&gt;{{cite news |last= Finke |first= Nikki |title=Hedge Fund Is Villain In Oliver Stone's ''Wall Street 2'': Shia LaBeouf &amp; Javier Bardem Set To Star With Michael Douglas; Filming Starts Aug. 10 For February 2010 |work=Deadline Hollywood Daily |pages= |publisher= |date=June 2, 2009 |url=http://www.deadline.com/2009/06/hedge-fund-is-villain-in-oliver-stones-wall-street-2-shia-labeouf-filming-starts-august-10th/ |accessdate=June 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but Bardem dropped out due to scheduling conflicts.&lt;ref name="olson"&gt;{{cite news |last= Olson |first= Parmy |title=Bardem Snubs ''Wall Street'' Sequel |work=[[Forbes]] |pages= |publisher= |date=July 22, 2009 |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/22/javier-bardem-wallstreet-markets-faces-streetwise.html |accessdate=August 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was finally released on September 24, 2010.&lt;ref name="DiOrio"&gt;{{cite news |last= DiOrio |first= Carl |title=Fox bumps Oliver Stone film |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |pages= |publisher= |date=March 10, 2010 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fox-bumps-oliver-stone-film-21496 |accessdate=November 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wesley Batista''' ([[Formosa (Goiás)|Formosa]], born December 8, 1972) is a Brazilian entrepreneur and founder of [[JBS S.A.]] Wesley Batista is the president of the JBS group and is responsible for the implementation of JBS operations in the USA since the acquisition of Swift in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epoca.globo.com/politica/noticia/2017/05/quem-sao-os-irmaos-bilionarios-que-podem-derrubar-michel-temer.html Wesley Batista: quem são os irmãos bilionários que podem derrubar Michel Temer]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===JBS founder and president===
Wesley Batista and his brother [[Joesley Batista]] were listed in 2016 among the 70 main billionaires of Brazil by [[Forbes]] magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com.br/listas/2016/08/70-maiores-bilionarios-do-brasil-em-2016/ 70 maiores bilionários do Brasil em 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016: Operation Car-Wash ===

In July 2016, Wesley Batista became a suspect in the investigations of [[Operation Car Wash]]. The Brazilian Federal Police charged him for alleged bribes made by his company, [[JBS S.A.]], to the former president of the Brazilian parliament [[Eduardo Cunha]], which were intended to help JBS with the liberation of resources from the [[Fundo de Investimento do Fundo de Garantia do Tempo de Serviço|FI-FGTS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://politica.estadao.com.br/blogs/fausto-macedo/pf-faz-buscas-na-casa-de-joesley-batista-da-friboi/ PF faz buscas na casa de Joesley Batista, da Friboi]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2017: Bribery and insider trading allegations ===

On May 17, 2017, the Batista brothers admitted to the Brazilian Federal Police bribing several Brazilian officers and politicians over the last 12 years. As a result of this bribes, him and his company JBS allegedly obtained funding from the [[BNDES]] of over R$10 billion at below market rates, and then using the funds to bribe politicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/politica/operacao-lava-jato/noticia/jbs-pagou-para-conseguir-aportes-e-financiamentos-do-bndes-diz-delacao-de-joesley-batista.ghtml JBS pagou para conseguir aportes e financiamentos do BNDES, diz delação de Joesley Batista]&lt;/ref&gt;  As compensation for the cooperation, the Brazilian Federal Police set Batista, his brother and other directors of [[JBS S.A.]] free of charges, having to pay a penalty of R$225 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/economia/negocios/noticia/jbs-diz-que-pagara-multa-de-r-225-milhoes-em-acordo-de-colaboracao-premiada.ghtml JBS pagará multa de R$ 225 milhões em acordo de colaboração premiada]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the release of the recordings, Batista and his brother [[Joesley Batista]] sold several shares of [[JBS S.A.]] and bought over USD 1 billion. The release of the recordings resulted in substantial reduction of the stock price of JBS S.A. shares and in the reduction of the value in the Brazilian Real. The Brazilian Securities Commission ("CVM") is investigating the Batista brothers for insider trading.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption-jbs-regulator-idUSKCN18F0AT Brazil watchdog opens new probes into JBS-related insider trading]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3234">'''Youth Business China''' ({{zh|c=中国青年创业国际计划}}), abbreviated '''YBC''', is a [[non-profit]] program in the [[People's Republic of China]] that aims to promote youth [[entrepreneurship]]. It is headquartered in [[Beijing]].

==History==

YBC was initiated by the [[All-China Youth Federation]] (ACYF), the [[Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security]], the [[All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce]], and other agencies in November 2003; YBC is implemented by the [[China Youth &amp; Children Foundation for Social Education]].

By using the tried model from Youth Business International and marshalling resources from all [[social sector]]s of China, especially the business community, YBC provides business [[mentoring]], [[seed money]], skills training and network support to young entrepreneurs, thus helps them succeed in business [[Startup company|start-up]]s.

YBC helps young people aged between 18 - 35 who are unemployed, under-employed and have a viable business idea and the passion for entrepreneurship but who lack business experience and have no access to seed money.

YBC provides young entrepreneurs with between US$4,000 to US$6,600 seed money; one to one accompanied mentoring; knowledge and know-how in running a business and access to business networks

As a non-profit programme with a [[think-tank]] function, YBC has been pursuing its goal to "promote entrepreneurship, enhance employability, create job opportunities, revitalise the economy, implement social responsibility and promote social harmony". YBC inspires the potential of youth and encourages them to take action.

In 2005, YBC was accredited as the best practice program by the [[UN Secretary General]]'s [[Youth Employment Network]] Office China.

==Cooperation==
In September 2008, [[Hewlett-Packard|HP China]] established a Chinese center for [[microenterprise]] development in cooperation with YBC, providing support and training to microenterprises and enterprise starters to use technology to build and grow their business. It provides accessory training rooms serving surplus rural workers, social youths, college students and migrant workers. The HP Microenterprise Development Program, which was introduced to China in 2007, is a nonprofit community investment program.
