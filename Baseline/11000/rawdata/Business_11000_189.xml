      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12054">An '''air waybill''' ('''AWB''') or '''air consignment note''' is a receipt issued by an international airline for goods and an evidence of the [[contract]] of carriage, but it is not a [[title (property)|document of title]] to the goods. Hence, the air waybill is [[Negotiable instrument|non-negotiable]].

==Description==
The air waybill is the most important document issued by a carrier either directly or through its authorized agent. It is a non-negotiable transport document that covers the transport of cargo from airport to airport. By accepting a shipment, an [[IATA]] cargo agent is acting on behalf of the carrier whose air waybill is issued.

Air waybills have eleven digit numbers which can be used to make bookings, check the status of delivery, and a current position of the shipment. 

Air waybills are issued in eight sets of different colours. The first three copies are classified as originals. The first original, green in colour, is the issuing carrier's copy. The second, coloured pink, is the consignee's copy. The third, coloured blue, is the shipper's copy. A fourth brown copy acts as the Delivery Receipt or proof of delivery. The other four copies are white.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccs.hu/index.php/en/downloads/doc/23/raw+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk PDF file]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
The main functions of an airway bill are:
* Contract of Carriage: Behind every original of the Air Waybill are conditions of contract for carriage documents. 
* Evidence of Receipt of Goods: When the shipper delivers goods to be forwarded, he will get a receipt. The receipt is proof that the shipment was handed over in good order and condition and also that the shipping instructions, as contained in the Shipper's Letter of Instructions, are acceptable. After completion, an original copy of the air waybill is given to the shipper as evidence of the acceptance of goods and as proof of contract of carriage 

* Freight Bill: The air waybill may be used as a bill or invoice together with supporting documents since it may indicate charges to be paid by the consignee, charges due to the agent or the carrier. An original copy of the air waybill is used for the carrier's accounting

* Certificate of Insurance: The air waybill may also serve as an evidence if the carrier is in a position to ensure the shipment and is requested to do so by the shipper.

* [[Customs declaration]]: Although customs authorities require various documents like a commercial invoice, packing list, etc. the air waybill too is proof of the freight amount billed for the goods carried and may be needed to be presented for customs clearance
The format of the air waybill has been designed by IATA and these can be used for both domestic as well as international transportation. These are available in two forms, viz. the airline logo equipped air waybill and the neutral air waybill.

Usually, airline air waybills are distributed to IATA cargo agents by IATA [[Airline|airlines]].
An air waybill shows:
*the carrier's name
*its head office address
*its [[logo]]
*the pre-printed eleven digit air waybill number

It is also possible to complete an air waybill through a computerized system. IATA's e-Air Waybill (e-AWB) programme and multilateral e-AWB Agreement remove the requirement for an air waybill to be issued as a paper document and therefore allow for electronic air waybill documentation.&lt;ref&gt;IATA, [http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/e/eawb/Pages/index.aspx e-AWB], accessed 28 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Agents all over the world are now using their own in-house computer systems to issue airlines' and freight forwarders' own air waybills. IATA cargo agents usually hold air waybills of several carriers. However, it gradually became difficult to accommodate these pre-numbered air waybills with the printed identification in the computer system. Therefore a neutral air waybill was created. Both types of air waybills have the same format and layout. However, the neutral air waybill does not bear any pre-printed individual name, head office address, logo and serial number.

==Validity==
An air waybill is a contract—an agreement enforceable by commercial law. To become a valid contract it has to be signed by the shipper or his agent and by the carrier or its authorized agent. Although the same individual or organisation may act on behalf of both the carrier and the shipper, the air waybill must be signed twice one each in the respective carrier and shipper boxes. Both signatures may be of the same person. This also implies that the air waybill should be issued immediately upon receipt of the goods and letter in instructions from the shipper.

As long as the air waybill is neither dated nor signed twice, the goods do not fall within the terms of the conditions of the contract and therefore the carrier will not accept any responsibility for the goods. The validity of the air waybill and thus the contract of carriage expires upon delivery of the shipment to the consignee (or his authorized agent).

==Responsibility for completion==
The air waybill is a contract—an agreement between the shipper and the carrier. The agent only acts as an intermediary between the shipper and carrier. The air waybill is also a contract of good faith. This means that the shipper will be responsible for the haul also be liable for all the damage suffered by the airline or any person due to irregularity, incorrectness or incompleteness of insertions on the air waybill, even if the air waybill has been completed by an agent or the carrier on his behalf.

When the shipper signs the AWB or issues the letter of instructions he simultaneously confirms his agreement to the conditions of contract.

==Non-negotiable==
Waybills are non-negotiable documents unlike bills of lading which are negotiable. The words non-negotiable are printed clearly at the top of the air waybill. This means that the air waybill is a contract for transportation only and does not represent (the value of) merchandise mentioned in the box nature and quantity of goods. The ocean bill of lading, if negotiated, may represent (the value of) the goods and must be endorsed by the party ultimately accepting the goods.
Although the AWB is a non-negotiable document, it can be used as a means of payment. This can be done only through the intermediary of a bank and only when the carriage is subject to a letter of credit. The air waybill executed according to the terms of a letter of credit allows the shipper to present the original of the air waybill to the bank and collect the billed value of the shipped goods from the bank. The amount paid by the bank to the shipper will be debited to the consignee who ordered the goods. At the destination the carrier will only hand over the goods to the consignee on receipt of a bank release order from the consignee's bankers.

The goods in the air [[consignment]] are consigned directly to the party (the [[consignee]]) named in the [[letter of credit]] (L/C). Unless the goods are consigned to a third party like the issuing bank, the importer can obtain the goods from the carrier at destination without paying the issuing bank or the consignor. Therefore, unless a cash payment has been received by the exporter or the buyer's integrity is unquestionable, consigning goods directly to the importer is risky.&lt;ref name=il&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wood |first1=Donald F. |last2=Barone |first2=Anthony |last3=Murphy |first3=Paul |last4=Wardlow |first4=Daniel L. |title=International Logistics |year=2002 |edition=2nd illustrated |isbn=978-0-8144-0666-3 |publisher=AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUIe8LVs11sC&amp;pg=PA193 |accessdate=15 Apr 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For air consignment to certain destinations, it is possible to arrange payment on a COD ([[cash on delivery]]) basis and consign the goods directly to the importer. The goods are released to the importer only after the importer makes the payment and complies with the instructions in the AWB.

In air freight, the exporter (the consignor) often engages a freight forwarder or consolidator to handle the forwarding of goods. The consignor provides a Shipper's Letter of Instructions which authorizes the forwarding agent to sign certain documents (e.g. the AWB) on behalf of the consignor.

The air waybill must indicate that the goods have been accepted for carriage, and it must be signed or authenticated by the carrier or the named agent for or on behalf of the carrier. The signature or authentication of the carrier must be identified as carrier, and in the case of agent signing or authenticating, the name and the capacity of the carrier on whose behalf the agent signs or authenticates must be indicated.

International air waybills that contain consolidated cargo are called master air waybills (MAWB). MAWBs have additional papers called house air waybills (HAWB). Each HAWB contains information of each individual shipment (consignee, contents, etc.) within the consolidation. International AWBs that are not consolidated (only one shipment in one bill) are called ''simple AWBs''. A house air waybill can also be created by a [[freight forwarder]]. When the shipment is booked, the airline issues a MAWB to the forwarder, who in turn issues their own house air waybill to the customer.&lt;ref name='il'/&gt;

==House and Master AWBs==
A freight forwarder offering a consolidation service, will issue its own air waybill. From now on AWB will be used to refer to both. This is called a Forwarder's or House AWB with its equivalent House BL. These act as contracts of carriage between the shipper and the forwarder, who in this case becomes a Deemed Carrier. The forwarder in turn enters into contracts with one or more carriers, often using more than one mode of transportation. The contract of carriage between the forwarder and carrier is called a Master Air Waybill. A House Air Waybill (HAWB) could act as a multimodal transport document.

==Air Waybill Number==
The AWB number has 11 digits and 3 parts.

*The first 3 digits are the ''Airline Prefix''&lt;ref&gt;[http://cargotracking.utopiax.org/aircargotracking.html Utopiax.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kovrik.com/sib/travel/airline-codes.txt Airline codes and ticketing codes]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The next 7 digits is the ''Serial Number'' of the AWB
*The last digit is the ''[[Check digit]]''
**The check digit is derived by dividing the 7 digit Serial Number by 7. The remainder determines the Check Digit. Example: Serial Number 8114074 divided by 7 is 1159153 '''with remainder 3'''. To easily calculate the remainder you can divide the 7 figures by 7, then subtract it with its integer, i.e. 8114074 divided by 7 = 1159153.428571429; 1159153.428571429 - 1159153 =  0.428571429; multiply the result by 7 and you will get the check digit by rounding it up or down to its closest integer. Here 0.428571429 x 7 = '''3''',000.... therefore the Serial Number + Check Digit is 8114074'''3'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.customs.gov.au/webdata/miniSites/sdg/reference_material/check_digit/awn.htm |title=Air Waybill Number Validation |last=Australian Customs Service |accessdate=2009-04-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523100909/http://www.customs.gov.au/webdata/miniSites/sdg/reference_material/check_digit/awn.htm |archivedate=23 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
Part of a copy of a [[British Caledonian Airways]] air waybill can be seen on the back of the cover of the album ''[[Band On The Run]]'' by [[Wings (band)|Wings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juno.co.uk/covers/318499-01-back.htm Back cover of Band on the Run by Wings]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Al Jadeed''''' ({{lang-ar|الجديد}}) Formerly known as '''NewTV''' privately owned 24-hour pan-Arab TV station. Based in [[Beirut]], it was created in 1991. Its owner has been accused many times of shaping the type of news the channel broadcasts and way it presents it.

On 9 May 2005, ''Al Jadeed'' was also launched in [[Americas|America]] and the [[Pacific]], reaching Arab speaking immigrants in the United States, Canada, [[South America]] and Australia.&lt;ref name="mysat"&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Jadeed |url=http://mysat.tv/TVChannels/AlJadeed/tabid/126/Default.aspx |publisher=Mysat.tv |accessdate=22 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419020754/http://mysat.tv/TVChannels/AlJadeed/tabid/126/Default.aspx |archivedate=19 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, it has become available for viewers in South America through [[Over-the-top content|over-the-top technology]] on [[MyTV (Arabic)|myTV]].

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
=== From 1991 to 1996: New TV ===
Up to 1996, New TV was regularly in conflict with the ruling leaders.

At the end of 1996, the Lebanese Ministry of Information decided to shut many TV stations, including New TV, the only secular broadcaster in Lebanese. Only five channels then got the right to broadcast, obviously chosen according to match religious communities’ demands.

=== Since 2001: ''Al Jadeed TV'' ===
From 2000, New TV has got a licence again and it became ''Al Jadeed'' TV in 2001.

==Attacks, threats and intimidation attempts against ''Al Jadeed'' TV ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
=== Broadcasting suspended in 2003 ===
In January 2003, Information Ministry [[Michel Samaha]] ordered to hold the broadcasting of ''Al Jadeed'' TV’s programs. This decision involved the Bila Rakeeb weekly program that had been advertising on revelations about [[Saudi Arabia]].

=== Chairman arrested in 2003 ===
On December 7, 2003, [[Tahseen Khayat]], ''Al Jadeed'' TV’s Chairman was arrested at home and held in custody for two days. The channel’s offices and Tahseen Khayat’s home were searched.

=== Threats against a female anchor in 2003 ===
In July 2003, ''Al Jadeed'' TV broadcast a new documentary involving the Lebanese General [[Jamil El Sayed]] in a corruption case with [[Syria]]. Most of the channel’s managers were summoned to the Tribunal of Beirut. Among them was [[Dalia Ahmad]], a famous anchor. As a non-Lebanese, her work permit was withdrawn and she was then told she could work for any other Lebanese TV station but not ''Al Jadeed''. She finally resigned in December 2003. She then worked in the United States for [[Al Horra TV]] and eventually came back to ''Al Jadeed'' TV after Jamil Al Sayed’s arrest in October 2005.

=== El Suddik case in 2006 ===
In December 2006, three ''Al Jadeed'' reporters were arrested following their investigation into the former Prime Minister [[Rafic Hariri]]’s assassination and their lead on [[Muhammad Zuhair El Suddik]], one of the [[false witnesses]]. They were jailed for 45 days and released after their report was broadcast.

=== Attack against the Chairman's house ===
In March 2010, a hundred members of the [[Druze]] community surrounded Tahseen Khayat’s house and threatened to set fire to it. Although they did some damage to the house, they eventually withdrew after the Druze leader [[Walid Jumblat]] intervened.

=== Murder of an ''Al Jadeed'' cameraman ===
On April 9th, 2012, an ''Al Jadeed'' crew went to northern Lebanon along the Syrian border. They were then fired at by the Syrian forces. [[Ali Shaaban]] was killed while Hussein Khreiss and Abed Khayat were seriously injured.

=== Assault against Al Jadeed headquarters in 2012 ===
{{One source|date=May 2018}}
In June 2012, masked men set fire to tires in front of ''Al Jadeed''’s office’s main door after the channel had released an interview with [[Ahma Al-Aseer]], a Sunni Sheikh. ''Al Jadeed''’s security team arrested one of the men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/2012/Jul-02/179066-suspect-in-al-jadeed-tv-station-attack-accused-of-attempted-murder.ashx#axzz2lrMeZ1DC |title=Suspect in Al-Jadeed TV station attack accused of attempted murder|publisher=[[The Daily Star (Lebanon)|''The Daily Star'' (Lebanon)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal attacks: Prosecution against ''Al Jadeed'' TV by the Special Tribunal for Lebanon ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
In January 2014, the [[Special Tribunal for Lebanon]]  (a [[UN]] mandated tribunal set to judge [[Rafic Hariri]]’s murderers) issued an order in lieu of indictment against the journalist [[Karma Khayat]] and ''Al Jadeed'' TV whom she was the information programs director at the time of the incriminated facts. The Lebanese journalist and the channel are accused of contempt charges and justice obstruction after they released compromising information regarding the witnesses’ protection system of the tribunal.

In August 2012, ''Al Jadeed'' TV had broadcast a 5 episodes documentary showing serious failures inside the tribunal related to the anonymity of the witnesses and their protection. Beside, the channel’s teams had taken all the necessary measures to keep the interrogated persons anonymous (blurred faces, no name given).

A year and a half later, Karma Khayat and ''Al Jadeed'' TV are being prosecuted for “undermining the confidence of the public in the ability of the tribunal to protect confidential information related to the witnesses or alleged witnesses” and to have disobeyed the order given by the Judge to stop broadcasting the reportage. They appeared in the court first in May 2014 for the pre-trial. The trial began on April 16, 2015 in [[The Hague]].

Karma Khayat could be sentenced up to 7 years in jail and fined €100,000. Moreover, despite the tribunal’s contradictions, this is the first time an organisation is prosecuted by an international tribunal which could make a precedent.

}}'''Alfred George Gardyne de Chastelain''', [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (1906–1974) was a British-Canadian businessman, soldier, and [[Espionage|secret agent]], noted for his actions during [[World War II]]. He was the father of [[Canadians|Canadian]] General [[John de Chastelain]].

== Early life and stay in Romania ==
[[File:Mr and Mrs de Chastelain.tif|thumb|left|Mr and Mrs de Chastelain in 1945]]
Born in [[London]] in February 1906, of [[Anglo-Scottish]] parents and of [[Huguenot]] background, he was educated in [[Scotland]] and the [[University of London]], from which he received a First Class degree in [[Engineering]]. On graduation, he moved to [[Romania]] and worked for Unirea (a [[BP|British Petroleum]] branch) in [[Bucharest]], rising to a managerial position towards the end of the 1930s. While in Bucharest, he married [[Marion Elizabeth Walsh]], the daughter of Jack Walsh, an [[United States|American]] accountant with [[Standard Oil of New Jersey]] in Romania.

==Wartime activities with the SOE ==
On the outbreak of war with [[Nazi Germany]], de Chastelain was commissioned into the [[Artists' Rifles]] and became a member of [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE), with which organisation he conducted [[sabotage]] operations in the [[Balkans]] and served in the [[North African campaign]].

In late 1943, with the rank of [[Lieutenant-Colonel]], he led a team of two other SOE members ([[Ivor Porter]] and [[Silviu Meţianu]]) by [[Paratrooper|parachute]] into Romania ([[Operation Autonomous]]), to test the possibility of the country's surrender to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] as the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] was losing battles on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] (''see [[Romania during World War II]]''). Captured by the [[Jandarmeria Română|Romanian Gendarmerie]] soon after their landing near [[Plosca]], [[Teleorman County]], he and his team were taken into custody as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and held in a Bucharest apartment.&lt;ref name="Duţu ''et al.''"&gt;Duţu ''et al.''&lt;/ref&gt;

They were all released in August 1944, when ''[[Conducător]]'' [[Ion Antonescu]] was overthrown and [[King of Romania|King]] [[Michael of Romania|Michael I]] assumed full powers (''see [[King Michael Coup]]'').&lt;ref name="Duţu ''et al.''"/&gt; Decorated, de Chastelain was demobilised after the war, joining a unit of the [[Special Air Service]] in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]].

==Life in the post-war era==
After the start of the [[Cold War]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities alleged that he was keeping contacts with [[Iuliu Maniu]], the leader of the [[National Peasants' Party]]; the latter had opposed both Antonescu's regime and the [[Soviet occupation of Romania]]. During [[Tămădău Affair|Maniu's trial for treason]] (1947), the [[List of Romanian Ministers of the Interior|Minister of the Interior]], [[Teohari Georgescu]], was handed a report which indicated Maniu's alleged contacts with de Chastelain as proof that the politician was a British spy.&lt;ref&gt;Pokivailova &amp; Chiper, p.48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside a group of partners, de Chastelain started [[Griffin Enterprises]] (1945), a business centered in London and [[Kent]], dealing in [[film processing]], import and exports and other activities. In 1954, he left that business to accept a post as Vice-President of the Canadian branch of an American oilwell drilling and services company, [[H. J. Eastman]], in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]].  Living for several years in Canada and then in [[Australia]], he returned to Canada in the early 1970s and died in Calgary at the age of 68.

A book giving an account of the SOE Operation in Romania was written by one member of the team, [[Ivor Porter]], later a British [[Ambassador]] (''Operation Autonomous: With SOE in Wartime Rumania'', [[Chatto and Windus]], 1989).

He was a founding member of the [[Special Forces Club]] in [[Knightsbridge]], and of the [[Food and Wine Society]] in Calgary.

==History==
AllBusiness was cofounded in 1999 by San Francisco lawyer Richard Harroch, Keith Belling, and Jerry Engel. Harroch served as the company's chairman, Belling as CEO, and Engel as chief financial officer. Within a year, AllBusiness grew to more than 100 employees and the company hired [[Teymour Boutros-Ghali]] (a nephew of former UN Secretary General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]]) as CEO and Belling moved to the position of President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Australian mining law''' governs the exploration and extraction of minerals and petroleum in Australia. It differs substantially from the mining laws of other common law countries, the most important differences arising from the policy decision that [[the Crown]] should own all minerals.

== History of mining law ==
The first Australian mining laws were enacted in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;
A proclamation by [[Charles Augustus FitzRoy|Charles Fitzroy]], [[Governors of New South Wales|Governor of New South Wales]], on 22 May 1851 asserted the Crown's right to all gold discovered in New South Wales. The [[Governors of Victoria|Victorian Governor]] issued a similar proclamation on 16 August 1851. In January 1852, Victoria enacted the Mining Act 1852 (repealed) supplemented by the Mining Act 1853 (repealed).&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, ownership of minerals and petroleum passed to those who were granted title to land by the colonial [[Governors of the Australian states|governors]] according to common law concepts, except the right to "Royal Mines" (the precious metals of gold and silver) which remained vested in [[the Crown]] by virtue of [[Royal prerogative]]. From 1855, colonial parliaments legislated for ownership of minerals to be retained by the Crown in future grants of [[freehold title]]. Thus, the situation developed where throughout Australia, the crown in right of the State owns nearly all the minerals.

== Legislation ==
In relation to minerals situated within state boundaries, first sight, the power to legislate for minerals remains with the states. However, despite the fact that the [[Constitution of Australia]] does not list minerals as an area over which the Federal Parliament has jurisdiction, a number of the Commonwealth Parliament's powers encompass matters relevant to mining operations and any legislation of the Commonwealth based upon these powers will override any inconsistent State legislation. As to Commonwealth jurisdiction over the Territories, the constitutional limitations regarding mining operations conducted within the States have no application in the Northern Territory, or other Australian territories.

Each of the States and Territories has its own legislation regulating the exploration for and production of onshore minerals.&lt;ref&gt;ACT: Land (Planning and Environment) Act 1991; Northern Territory: Mining Act 1980; NSW: Mining Act 1992; Queensland: Mineral Resources Act 1989; South Australia: Mining Act 1971; Tasmania: Mineral Resources Development Act 1995; Victoria: Mineral Resources Development Act 1990; Western Australia: Mining Act 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The Commonwealth has no onshore mining legislation which is applicable in the States or Territories.

As to offshore minerals, the Commonwealth has [[sovereignty]] in respect of the [[territorial sea]], and sovereign rights in respect of both the [[continental shelf]] and the [[exclusive economic zone]] for the purpose of exploitation of their natural resources. Thus, the sovereignty over minerals of the States and the Northern Territory extends only to the low-water mark and it is the Commonwealth which is entitled under international law to exercise sovereignty over minerals under the territorial sea, within the exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf. However, following an agreement negotiated between the Commonwealth Government and the States in 1979, the Commonwealth conferred power on the States and the Northern Territory to make laws for matters including mining operations in respect of the coastal waters and granted them proprietary rights to the seabed.

In addition, the Corporations Act 2001 and the [[Australian Stock Exchange]] Listing Rules contain special provisions governing the conduct and reporting requirements of mining companies.

== Ownership of minerals ==
According to the maxim "[[Cuius est solum eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos|to whomsoever the soil belongs, he owns also to the sky and to the depths]]", there is a presumption that a land owner also owns all minerals on or beneath the surface of that land.&lt;ref&gt;The original maxim is Latin: ''cujus est solum, ejus est usque ad coelum et usque ad inferos''. It was applied in a mining context in ''Commonwealth v New South Wales'' (1923) 33 CLR 1 at 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The presumption is subject to the exception of the Royal metals. As early as the sixteenth century, the [[common law]] has held that all gold and silver, whether situated on public or private land, has been owned by the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;''Case of Mines'' (1567) 1 Plowd 310; 75 ER 472.&lt;/ref&gt; This Royal prerogative has also been applied in Australia, by both common law&lt;ref&gt;''Woolley v A-G (Vic)'' (1877) LR 2 App Cas 163 at 167–8&lt;/ref&gt; and legislation.&lt;ref&gt;(New South Wales) Mining Act 1992 s 379 (gold and silver mines); (Queensland) Mineral Resources Act 1989 s 8 (all minerals); (South Australia) Mining Act 1971 s 16 (all minerals); (Tasmania) Mineral Resources Development Act 1995 s 6(4) (gold, silver, oil, hydrogen, helium and atomic substances); (Victoria) Mineral Resources Development Act 1990 s 9 (most minerals); (Western Australia) Mining Act 1978 s 9 (all precious metal, and all other minerals not alienated from the Crown before 1 January 1899).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the principle of the owner of land owning the minerals within it has been virtually abolished by statute in Australia {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. The general rule is that the Crown (in right of the State) owns all minerals. This has been implemented by statute; initially by enacting that all future grants of land must contain a reservation to the Crown of all minerals. Now, all new grants of freehold titles in Australia have provided that all minerals were reserved to the Crown.

In respect of titles granted prior to the legislation, the owner of the land retained ownership of the minerals (except the Royal metals of gold and silver). That owner may grant a [[profit à prendre]] to enter and take minerals.

Crown ownership of minerals has been made universal in Victoria&lt;ref&gt;Mineral Resources Development Act 1990 s 9.&lt;/ref&gt; and South Australia&lt;ref&gt;Mining Act 1971 s 16.&lt;/ref&gt; by legislative expropriation of all minerals. In Tasmania&lt;ref&gt;Mineral Resources Development Act 1995 s 6(4).&lt;/ref&gt; and New South Wales,&lt;ref&gt;Coal Acquisition Act 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; this approach of legislative expropriation has been applied on a selective basis (in Tasmania, for gold, silver, oil, hydrogen, helium and atomic substances, and, in New South Wales, for coal). The Crown, pursuant to statute, may grant various leases or licences to enter onto land and take minerals.

State ownership of minerals has had the important result that governments, rather than private landholders, determine the legal regimes governing mineral exploration and production.

== Ratified agreements ==
Large mining operations are likely to be regulated by a ratified agreement, sometimes also called a "state agreement", an "agreement act", a "franchise agreement", a "government agreement" or a "special agreement act". The basis of such an agreement is that the State contracts with the miner in the form of a written agreement which is ratified by a statute of that State or Territory Parliament. This ratification ensures that the provisions of the negotiated agreement have legislative effect and override any inconsistent provisions under the general mining legislation or any other statutes of that State or Territory. Ratified agreements have been used throughout Australia to establish large, export-oriented mining projects since the 1950s.  They have been most extensively used in West Australia, where a high proportion of large mining projects continue to operate under such arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;See Anne M Fitzgerald, "Mining Agreements: Negotiated frameworks in the Australian minerals sector" (2001), at http://eprints.qut.edu.au/34063/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Bambang Sutrisno begin building his fortune by working together with brother Benny Suherman and Suwikatmono, the cousin of then President Suharto, to establish [[21 Cineplex]]. 21 Cineplex hosted 650 movie screens in Indonesia.  In the mid-1980s. Bambang left PT Suptan Film to start up his own supermarket chain business, the well-known Golden Truly chain, in Indonesia. He also set up Bank Surya. These businesses were once again set up with the help and connections of Suwikatmono, the cousin of then President [[Suharto]]. In 1997, during the economic financial crisis, the Indonesian government gave banks such as Bank Surya bailout money and Bambang Sutrisno embezzled 1.5 trillion Indonesian rupiah, the equivalent of around 200 million US dollars. Before he could be arrested, Bambang Sutrisno fled to neighbouring Singapore where he has obtained Permanent Resident status. Bambang Sutrisno was convicted of embezzlement in absentia in 1999 and sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name=jarkartapost-2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/singapore-none-too-fussy-about-the-source-of-wealth-in-itsfinancial-sector/2006/07/25/1153816182787.html |title=Singapore none too fussy about the source of wealth in its financial sector |date=July 2006 |publisher= The Age Australia |accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kyoto&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp/coe21/dp/151-160/21COE-DP157.pdf |title=Relationship between Chinese businessmen and local elites in Malaysia and Indonesia |date=January 2008 |publisher=Kyoto University |accessdate=26 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222150317/http://www.kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp/coe21/dp/151-160/21COE-DP157.pdf |archive-date=2014-02-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sinema&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sinema.sg/2011/08/09/omega-film%E2%80%99s-hollywood-import-license-under-fire/ |title=Omega's Film's Hollywood Import License Under Fire |date=August 2011 |publisher= Sinema.sg |accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bremach VVFF.JPG|thumb|'''Bremach''' [[fire engine]].]]
'''Bremach''' was an [[Italy|Italian]] manufacturer of tactical [[trucks]] specializing in the manufacture of [[military]] [[vehicles]] and [[4WD]] [[fire engine]]s.

==History==
[[File:Bremach ND3.JPG|thumb|left|[[Macchi MB1]] — produced by Bremach]]
Bremach was founded in 1956s in the city of [[Varese]] (in northern [[Italy]]) by the Brenna brothers, owners of a repair workshop, purchasing the license for the production of the three-wheeler ''Macchi MB1'' motorcycle from [[Aermacchi]]. The names Bremach was formed by the combination of '''BRE'''nna and '''MA'''c'''CH'''i.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bremach.it/company/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812205114/http://www.bremach.it/company/ |archivedate=2014-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since 1983, the company began production of its most famous car series GR (4x4). It includes a unified multi-purpose all-wheel drive car bonnet GR35 and GR45 full weight of 3.5-4.5 with a four-cylinder 2.5-liter diesel engine IVECO 75&amp;nbsp;hp (With turbo charging - 103 HP).

In 1993, the issue was launched low-frame chassis BRIO (Brio) 4x2 with engine 75&amp;nbsp;hp for municipal services. Overall height (1820&amp;nbsp;mm) allows their use in low confined areas.

By 2000, business firms Bremach Industry went bad, and it was decided to merge with companies Pro. DE and VALSELLA MECCANOTECNICA.

From 2001 to 2002, offers a new all-wheel drive Bremach family Extreme (Extreme). Technically, the new machines Bremach Brick and Extreme (4x4) do not differ from the previous series of GR. They are still equipped with the 2.8-liter diesel engine IVECO 8140.43 with direct fuel injection and turbocharging, developing 105&amp;nbsp;hp and to comply with Euro-3 .

[[File:Bremach Job.jpg|thumb|left|Bremach Job]]

Since 2006 Bremach offers a completely redesigned range of cars Brick, Extreme and Job with updated cabins, having a streamlined front fascia with round plastic hood and distinctive drop-shaped glass headlights. Technically Bremach Brick and Extreme (4x4) is not much different from the previous series of GR. The main difference between highway "hard workers" from their counterparts - the possibility of a complete set air suspension and 146-horsepower turbodiesel allowing laden car to reach speeds up to 125&amp;nbsp;km / h. These chassis have chosen the company, the creators of technology for the police and other law enforcement agencies, as well as ambulances [source not specified 670 days] .

Since 2008 he has presented a new Bremach T-REX, which replaced the old lineup. Its peculiarity transmission consisting of a base mechanical six-speed ZF transmission with a two-stage transfer case, providing up to 24 forward gears and four back. Suspension of the machine consists of a beam axle on the springs, and the new cab T-REX is the main feature of the previous models, it has a completely new design, improved visibility and heavy-duty space frame, which had previously only been used in aircraft and race cars of Formula 1 [citation Set 670 days] .
[[File:Bremach T.REX.JPG|thumb|Bremach T Rex]]

In 2009 Bremach Industry in conjunction with the [[Ulyanovsk Automobile Plant]] start development of a new special truck chassis-based Bremach-UAZ T-REX. It was assumed that the cars UAZ T-REX terrain capacity of up to 3.5 tonnes will be made under the orders of end customers for the needs of the road construction sector, government agencies, as well as special vehicles for the emergency operation at processing facilities in remote regions. As far as is known from reliable sources, this project has not received further development.

In 2011, Bremach released demokar electric Bremach T-REX EV. Frame cabin, an "adaptive spatial framework", which is strengthened high-strength steel, capable of withstanding a load of 5+1 G . The heart of the T-REX is the roll bar which avoids any cracks and deformations, even in the case of very heavy loads. In Germany, the cars were subject to a heavy military tests (virtual and real), and they were assigned the necessary certificates for art through KMW . Small size and high load capacity electric Bremach T-REX revolutionized the field of special transport at the international level. Specially made for this project Bremach used today only in the areas of aerospace and aviation.

A '''business manager''' drives the work of others in order to run a major [[business]] efficiently and make a large [[economic profit|profit]]. They should have working knowledge of the following areas, and may be a specialist in one or more, such as [[finance]], [[marketing]] or [[public relations]]. Other technical areas in which a business manager may have expertise are [[law]], [[science]], and [[computer programming]].

==Role profile==
In many businesses, the role may be established to relieve the owner of responsibility, in order to focus on specific aspects of company expansion. Typically, the business manager and the owner work may work in [[synergy]] to ensure successful running of business. Having a [[Specialization (functional)|specialization]] in a particular field, such as sales, marketing, public relations or finance would aid efficiency, yet despite the academic qualities a business manager should have, they should also develop personal qualities that will be helpful in performing the role efficiently.

A business manager should be willing to accept [[constructive criticism]] from employees, develop [[social skills]], be organized, honest and able to take good decisions. A good business manager should be willing to work along his or her employees in order to create a better work environment.

==Examples in industry==
In the [[music industry]], a business manager is a representative of [[musician|musicians]] or [[recording artist|recording artists]] or both, whose main job is to supervise their business affairs and financial matters. The role largely originated from [[Allen Klein]], who represented numerous performers, helping them to both invest their incomes wisely and to recover unpaid (or underpaid) [[royalties]] and fees.

Business managers commonly have an overlapping presence in both the entertainment and sports industries, as illustrated by business manager [[Barry Klarberg]], who represents entertainer [[Justin Timberlake]] as well professional athletes [[C. J. Wilson]], [[Mark Messier]] and [[Anna Kournikova]].&lt;ref name="sportsbusinessdaily"&gt;Sports Business Journal. [http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2012/04/09/Labor-and-Agents/Monarch.aspx "Athlete advisors Klarberg, Furst Close to Deal"], April 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In government and the military, the equivalent position is [[Executive Officer|executive officer]] or [[Chief of Staff|chief of staff]].

De Benedetti is chairman of the Rodolfo De Benedetti Foundation (Fondazione Rodolfo Debenedetti) in Milan, which he founded in 1998 in memory of his father. It promotes research into economic policy decisions regarding the labor market and welfare systems in Europe.&lt;ref name="BIOTRENTO2012"&gt;[http://2012.festivaleconomia.eu/en/people/carlo-de-benedetti "Profile: Carlo De Benedetti"], Festival of Economics of Trento, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RBF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frdb.org|title=www.frdb.org Fondazione Rodolfo DeBenedetti - Highlights|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is currently married to the former actress [[Silvia Monti]].

==Life and career==
Born into a wealthy [[Jewish]] family, on 14 November 1934, Carlo De Benedetti is the brother of Italian Senator [[Franco Debenedetti]], whose surname is different owing to a spelling error.&lt;ref name="corriere-16011997"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1997/gennaio/16/Benedetti_indagato_con_fratello_Carlo_co_0_970116606.shtml|title=De Benedetti indagato con il fratello Carlo|date=16 January 1997|newspaper=[[Corriere della Sera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, during the [[World War II]], the De Benedetti family fled to [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="repubblica-02112009" /&gt; After Carlo returned to Italy, he received a degree in [[electrical engineering]] from the [[Polytechnic University of Turin]]&lt;ref name="gazzettadimantova" /&gt; and in 1959 began to work in his father's manufacturing business, the ''Compagnia Italiana Tubi Metallici Flessibili''. He helped improve company profits consistently and in 1972 acquired the ''Gilardini'' company, of which he became president and CEO until 1976.&lt;ref name="gazzettadimantova" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Carlo De Benedetti left Italy to return to Switzerland in 1975, owing to possible terrorist threats during the [[Anni di Piombo]] period of Italian domestic terrorism.&lt;ref name="repubblica-02112009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes-19021984" /&gt;

For a brief period, from 4 May to 25 August 1976, he was appointed [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[FIAT]].&lt;ref name="stampa-27012009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/economia/200901articoli/40415girata.asp|title=Tra industria e Borsa cinquant’anni sul ring|date=27 January 2009|work=LaStampa.it|access-date=2009-12-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322004853/http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/economia/200901articoli/40415girata.asp#|archive-date=2012-03-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His resignation from Fiat was caused, according to De Benedetti, by his decision to lay off 65,000 workers, which was refused by Fiat head [[Gianni Agnelli]];&lt;ref name="stampa-27012009" /&gt; other sources say that he was suspected of trying to build up a takeover of power within the company, with the backing Swiss financial groups.&lt;ref name="giornale-19082009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/interni/de_benedetti_finanziere_moralista_che_piace_sinistra/19-08-2009/articolo-id=374927-page=0-comments=1|title=De Benedetti, finanziere moralista che piace alla sinistra|work=ilGiornale.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1976, De Benedetti acquired the [[CIR Group]],&lt;ref name="gazzettadimantova" /&gt; thereby also obtaining control of the national newspaper ''[[La Repubblica]]'' and the newsmagazine ''[[L'Espresso]]''. In 1978 he became [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of the Italian manufacturer [[Olivetti]],&lt;ref name="gazzettadimantova" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes-04091996"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/04/business/de-benedetti-steps-down-as-the-chairman-of-olivetti.html | work=The New York Times | title=De Benedetti Steps Down as the Chairman of Olivetti | first=John | last=Tagliabue | date=4 September 1996 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he remained until his resignation in 1996.&lt;ref name="nytimes-04091996"/&gt; As president of Olivetti, since 1983,&lt;ref name="gazzettadimantova" /&gt; he quickly and ruthlessly reorganized the company, switching its focus from mechanical [[typewriters]] to [[computers]].&lt;ref name="nytimes-19021984"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/19/business/crafting-a-high-tech-renaissance-at-olivetti.html?&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=Crafting A High-Tech Renaissance At Olivetti | first=John | last=Tagliabue | date=February 19, 1984 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, along with other leading business figures, he founded the [[European Round Table of Industrialists]], of which he was vicepresident until 2004. In 1985 he became a member of the European Advisory Committee of the [[New York Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name="lastampa-26012009"/&gt;

In 1995 De Benedetti founded the [[telecommunications]] companies [[Omnitel]] and [[Infostrada]].&lt;ref name="lastampa-26012009"/&gt;

In 1997 he created the [[Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso]] (''L'Espresso Editorial Group''),&lt;ref name="repubblica-26031997"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1997/03/26/fusione-espresso-repubblica-avremo-piu.html|title=FUSIONE L' ESPRESSO - REPUBBLICA 'AVREMO PIU' RISORSE PER CRESCERE'|work=Archivio - la Repubblica.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; by merging the ''[[L'Espresso]]'' and ''[[La Repubblica]]'' editorial groups. [[Carlo Caracciolo]] was appointed president of the group. However, Carlo De Benedetti assumed the presidency in 2006, after the death of Caracciolo.&lt;ref name="rainews24-caracciolo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainews24.rai.it/it/news.php?newsid%3D89522 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613144537/http://www.rainews24.rai.it/it/news.php?newsid=89522 |archivedate=2011-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 January 2009, at a press conference, De Benedetti announced his decision to retire from all his executive positions in the CIR group, keeping only - at the request of the Board of Directors - the position of Chairman of the Espresso Group. All the executive positions in the CIR group were given to the current Chief Executive, [[Rodolfo De Benedetti]].&lt;ref name="wsj-20090127"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rassegnastampa.mef.gov.it/mefinternazionale/PDF/2009/2009-01-27/2009012711676597.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172029/http://rassegnastampa.mef.gov.it/mefinternazionale/PDF/2009/2009-01-27/2009012711676597.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The SME affair===
In 1985, [[Romano Prodi]], then president of the state-owned [[Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale|IRI]] (Institute for Industrial Reconstruction), tried to sell the IRI share in [[SME (agricultural company)|SME]] (a former state-owned agency, later turned food industry conglomerate) to De Benedetti, who was then president of [[Buitoni]] (a food industry belonging to the CIR group), for 497 billion [[Italian lira]].&lt;ref name="repubblica-05052003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/politica/smeprocesso/vicenda/vicenda.html|title=La Repubblica/politica: La vicenda Sme Dall'Iri a Berlusconi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="la-voce-10072003"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lavoce.info/articoli/pagina540.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009204318/http://www.lavoce.info/articoli/pagina540.html |archivedate=2010-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other offers for SME included most notably one for a [[joint venture]] with [[Fininvest]], a media group owned by entrepreneur and former Italian prime minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. The sale to De Benedetti was later blocked by the then Italian prime minister [[Bettino Craxi]],&lt;ref name="repubblica-05052003"/&gt; and SME remained state-owned until almost 10 years later.

De Benedetti brought IRI to court in an attempt to appeal the block, but the court, presided over by judge Filippo Verde, denied his case in 1986.&lt;ref name="repubblica-26112009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/politica/toghe/sme/sme.html|title=la Repubblica/politica: La vicenda Sme|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, [[Silvio Berlusconi]], [[Cesare Previti]] and [[Attilio Pacifico]] were accused of having bribed Filippo Verde and [[Renato Squillante]] to fix the trial against De Benedetti.&lt;ref name="corsera-11112003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2003/11_Novembre/22/sme_storia.shtml|title=Corriere della Sera - Sme, storia di un processo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlusconi was later acquitted.

According to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' on 7 June 2011, Berlusconi was found guilty of bribery and ordered to pay 560 million € to CIR.

===Tangentopoli===
In 1993, during the ''[[Mani Pulite]]'' (Clean Hands) political-corruption investigations, Carlo De Benedetti was arrested and  admitted to having paid a 10 billion Italian lira bribe to government parties, to obtain a purchase order from the [[Poste Italiane|Italian Postal Service]] for obsolete [[teleprinter]]s and computers. In May of that year, he was officially put under investigation, but De Benedetti never went to trial for this episode, the [[statute of limitations]] having expired.&lt;ref name="repubblica-21051993"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Banco Ambrosiano''===
De Benedetti became deputy chairman of the Italian bank [[Banco Ambrosiano]] in 1981, by acquiring 2% of the capital, but left after only 61 days.&lt;ref name="lastampa-26012009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="repubblica-13031991"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1991/03/13/de-benedetti-rinviato-giudizio.html|title=DE BENEDETTI RINVIATO A GIUDIZIO|work=Archivio - la Repubblica.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1992, Carlo De Benedetti and 32 other people were convicted of fraud by a Milan court in connection with the collapse of the bank.&lt;ref name=RMN&gt;"Court Convicts Financier, 23 Others in Billion-Dollar Failure of Italian Bank," ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', April 17, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Benedetti was sentenced to six years and four months in prison,&lt;ref name=RMN/&gt; but the sentence was overturned in April 1998, by the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]].&lt;ref&gt;
   "High court overturns conviction of Olivetti chairman in

==Politics==
Carlo De Benedetti has often been identified with Italian [[centre left]] politics.&lt;ref name="sole24ore-27012009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/SoleOnLine4/Mondo/2009/01/visti-da-lontano-de-benedetti-imprenditore-sfavillante.shtml?uuid=348b1e7e-ec78-11dd-b219-9063977eaf68|title=De Benedetti: imprenditore sfavillante e "nemico" di Berlusconi - Il Sole 24 ORE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a long-standing feud with [[Silvio Berlusconi]], and his [[Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso|L'Espresso editorial group]] currently publishes the main centre-left-leaning Italian newspaper (''[[La Repubblica]]'') and newsmagazine (''[[L'Espresso]]''). He has been called a "foe of Berlusconi" by the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref name="wsj-20090127"/&gt;

In October 2005, De Benedetti reportedly offered [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], then the [[Finance Minister of Israel]], the position of [[List of Italian Ministers of Economy and Finance|Italian finance minister]], which Netanyahu declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Eli |last=Shimoni|title= Bibi: I declined ministerial job offer in Italy |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3184997,00.html |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=2005-12-15 |accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Benedetti later said it had been a joke. [[Ehud Gol]], the Israeli ambassador to Italy, had introduced the men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Yossi |last=Bar|title= Italian tycoon: Treasury offer to Bibi was joke |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3185461,00.html |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=2005-12-16 |accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3086">In [[project management]], a '''change order''' also referred to as a '''contract change note''' refers to the changes in the [[Scope (project management)|scope]] of work agreed to by the owner, contractor, and architect or engineer.

A change order is work that is added to or deleted from the original scope of work of a contract, however, depending on the magnitude of the change, it may or may not alter the original contract amount and/or completion date. A change order may force a new project to handle significant changes to the current project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmhut.com/project-management-process-phase-3-implementing-change-control Project Management Process - Phase 3 - Implementing - Change Control]&lt;/ref&gt;

Change orders are common to most projects, and very common with large projects. After the original scope (or contract) is formed, complete with the total price to be paid and the specific work to be completed, a client may decide that the original plans do not best represent his or her definition for the finished project. Accordingly, the client will suggest an alternate approach.

Common causes for change orders to be created are:

* The project's work was incorrectly estimated
* The customer or project team discovers obstacles or possible efficiencies that require them to deviate from the original plan
* The customer or project team are inefficient or incapable of completing their required deliverables within budget, and additional money, time, or resources must be added to the project
* During the course of the project, additional features or options are perceived and requested.
* If the contractor has to add work items to the original scope of work at a later time in order to achieve the customer's demands, a fair price for the work items and fees must be added for the materials and labor. 
* Extreme weather conditions cause delays or require additional work to complete construction.

A [[project manager]] then typically generates a change order that describes the new work to be done (or not done in some cases), and the price to be paid for this new work. Once this change order is submitted and approved it generally serves to alter the original contract such that the change order now becomes part of the contract.

'''''Co-opetition: A Revolution Mindset that Combines Competition and Cooperation''''' is a non-fiction book on [[coopetition]] (co-operative competition), [[business strategy]], and [[game theory]] by [[Adam M. Brandenburger]] and [[Barry J. Nalebuff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385479506|publisher=[[amazon.com]]|title=Co-Opetition Paperback by Adam M. Brandenburger, Barry J. Nalebuff |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was initially published by [[Crown Business]] on May 1, 1996. As of 2015, the book is still available in its 9th printing.

==Overview==
Coopetition or co-opetition is a neologism coined to describe the concept of cooperative competition. Coopetition is a [[portmanteau]] of cooperation and competition.

The text discusses at length the notion of coopetition, a business strategy gained from game theory to demonstrate when it is better for competitors to work together rather than to go up against one another in contest. The authors use many examples to show the simultaneous interplay between competition and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/17487/co-opetition-by-adam-m-brandenburger/|publisher=penguinrandomhouse.com|title=About Co-opetition|accessdate=2015-05-06|first=|last=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their research added to previous industry analysis such as [[Michael Porter]]’s [[five forces model]], which focused almost entirely on competition between businesses.

==Review==
{{quote|At one time or another, everyone wants life to be more rational and scientific. Then we wouldn't have to spend so much late-night time on the phone with friends, playing out scenarios of the possibilities life offers. Corporate executives aren't exempt from this desire. They too spin scenarios, of the bottom-line variety. This must have been the audience Adam M. Brandenburger and Barry J. Nalebuff had in mind when they wrote Co-opetition, a book about "the game theory strategy that's changing the game of business," as they put it. Mr. Brandenburger, a Harvard Business School professor, and Mr. Nalebuff, who teaches at the Yale School of Management, believe businesses can become more competitive by cooperating, hence the neologism "co-opetition." ... The authors never really make clear what distinguishes game theory from good business sense. Decision-making is looking upside, downside, matching advantage against disadvantage, marrying a weakness to a strength and occasionally doing something "counterintuitive" that actually makes complete sense in context. Since the book is full of good stories, it's hard not to recommend it, but readers looking for science are likely to be disappointed.}}

'''The Creditsafe Group''' is a privately owned multinational provider of on-line company credit scores and credit report information. Founded in 1997 the company has expanded and now has operations in 12 countries across Europe, North America &amp; Japan and claims to be the world’s most-used provider of company credit reports. Creditsafe now employs over 1,200 people and has a customer base in excess of 100,000 subscription customers worldwide.

== History ==

Creditsafe was founded in 1997 in [[Oslo]], Norway with the idea of using the then emerging technology of the internet to supply business information to a market of smaller and medium-sized businesses by selling over the telephone and delivering reports over the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creditsafe Group|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=1586691|website=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Norwegian launch Creditsafe established an office in [[Gothenburg]] Sweden in 1998 before moving to the UK in 2000. Creditsafe re-located the UK sales operation to [[Caerphilly]] in [[South Wales]] in 2002. In 2006 Creditsafe France was launched in [[Roubaix]] near [[Lille]]. Additional entities were later launched in [[Dublin]] in Ireland in 2007, [[The Hague]] in the [[Netherlands]] in 2008, [[Berlin]], Germany in 2010, [[Brussels]], Belgium in 2011 and [[Turin]] in Italy in 2013. Creditsafe moved outside [[Europe]] in 2012 with the founding of Creditsafe United States in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;"Creditsafe USA to create 250 jobs in South Whitehall" - http://southwhitehall.patch.com/groups/business-news/p/creditsafe-usa-to-create-250-jobs-in-south-whitehall&lt;/ref&gt; Since launching in the USA, Creditsafe have now increased its US workforce by opening a new office in [[Tempe, Arizona]]&lt;ref&gt;"Creditsafe opens office in Tempe; plans to hire 150" - http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2014/11/18/creditsafe-opens-office-in-tempe-plans-to-hire-150.html&lt;/ref&gt; Creditsafe established a shared service centre in [[Cardiff]] [[Wales]] in 2006 which has grown to support the sales operations around the world. In September 2016, Creditsafe set up its own operation in [[Japan]]. [[:ja:クレディセイフ企業情報|Creditsafe Japan]] has its offices in [[Fukuoka]] and [[Tokyo]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/creditsafe-brings-new-intelligence-to-japan-300324730.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current Status ==

In each country in which it operates Creditsafe has a sales and customer service operation dealing with customers over the telephone and internet. Creditsafe employs over 1,200 people in its 16 offices in 10 countries it currently has just over 200,000 subscription users.

Creditsafe claims to be the world’s most-used provider of on-line company credit reports and estimates it will deliver over 110 million reports during 2016.&lt;ref&gt;“Creditsafe - About Us Presentation” - http://www.creditsafe.com/media/662974/creditsafe-introduction-presentation.pptx&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products and services ==

Creditsafe’s core business offering is an on-line company credit report based on original source public and private data which is brought together to give information on a company and an assessment of its creditworthiness. Creditsafe provides a credit rating and suggested credit limit in all its reports.

Creditsafe reports are accessed via Creditsafe’s own websites over the internet by most of its customers however increasing large volume customers purchase solutions that either integrate into their own accounting software or use one of Creditsafe’s own integrated services such as Creditsafe 3D.

Creditsafe combines data from all its operating countries in its reports in an attempt to provide full international details on companies that operate in more than one country or who have other international linkages.

'''Electrospinning''' is a fiber production method which uses electric force to draw charged threads of [[polymer solution]]s or [[polymer]] melts up to fiber diameters in the order of some hundred nanometers. Electrospinning shares characteristics of both [[electrospray]]ing and conventional solution [[spinning (polymers)#Dry spinning|dry spinning]] of fibers.&lt;ref name="ziabicki"&gt;Ziabicki, A. (1976) ''Fundamentals of fiber formation'', John Wiley and Sons, London, {{ISBN|0-471-98220-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The process does not require the use of coagulation chemistry or high temperatures to produce solid threads from solution. This makes the process particularly suited to the production of fibers using large and complex molecules. Electrospinning from molten precursors is also practiced; this method ensures that no [[solvent]] can be carried over into the final product.

==Process==
When a sufficiently high [[voltage]] is applied to a liquid droplet, the body of the liquid becomes charged, and [[electrostatic repulsion]] counteracts the [[surface tension]] and the [[droplet]] is stretched; at a critical point a stream of liquid erupts from the surface. This point of eruption is known as the [[Taylor cone]]. If the molecular cohesion of the liquid is sufficiently high, stream breakup does not occur (if it does, droplets are electrosprayed) and a charged liquid jet is formed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwniZlsLJlY High speed video of the taylor cone formation and electrospinning]. youtube.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn6r1Ag1npE Single nozzle electrospinning process nanofiber formation video]. youtube.com&lt;/ref&gt;

As the jet dries in flight, the mode of current flow changes from ohmic to convective as the charge migrates to the surface of the fiber. The jet is then elongated by a whipping process caused by [[electrostatic]] repulsion initiated at small bends in the fiber, until it is finally deposited on the grounded collector.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wap9A1kWXr0 High speed video of the whipping instability]. youtube.com&lt;/ref&gt; The elongation and thinning of the fiber resulting from this bending instability leads to the formation of uniform fibers with [[nanometer]]-scale diameters.&lt;ref name="reinventing the wheel"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/adma.200400719|title=Electrospinning of Nanofibers: Reinventing the Wheel?|year=2004|last1=Li|first1=D.|last2=Xia|first2=Y.|journal=Advanced Materials|volume=16|issue=14|pages=1151–1170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parameters==
* Molecular weight, molecular-weight distribution and architecture (branched, linear etc.) of the polymer
* Solution properties (viscosity, conductivity and surface tension)
* Electric potential, flow rate and concentration 
* Distance between the capillary and collection screen
* Ambient parameters (temperature, humidity and air velocity in the chamber) 
* Motion and size of target screen (collector)
* Needle gauge

==Apparatus and range==
The standard laboratory setup for electrospinning consists of a [[spinneret (polymers)|spinneret]] (typically a [[hypodermic syringe]] needle) connected to a high-voltage (5 to 50&amp;nbsp;kV) direct current power supply, a [[syringe driver|syringe pump]], and a grounded collector.  A [[polymer]] solution, [[sol-gel]], particulate suspension or melt is loaded into the syringe and this liquid is extruded from the needle tip at a constant rate by a syringe pump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merritt|first=Sonia R.|author2=Agata A. Exner |author3=Zhenghong Lee |author4=Horst A. von Recum |title=Electrospinning and Imaging|journal=Advanced Engineering Materials|date=May 2012|volume=14|issue=5|pages=B266–B278|doi=10.1002/adem.201180010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the droplet at the tip of the spinneret can be replenished by feeding from a header tank providing a constant feed pressure. This constant pressure type feed works better for lower viscosity feedstocks.

==Other techniques==
Modification of the spinneret and/or the type of solution can allow for the creation of fibers with unique structures and properties. Electrospun fibers can adopt a porous or core–shell morphology depending on the type of materials being spun as well as the evaporation rates and [[miscibility]] for the solvents involved. For techniques which involve multiple spinning fluids, the general criteria for the creation of fibers depends upon the spinnability of the outer solution.&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/la063194q|title=Co-electrospinning of Core−Shell Fibers Using a Single-Nozzle Technique|year=2007|last1=Bazilevsky|first1=Alexander V.|last2=Yarin|first2=Alexander L.|last3=Megaridis|first3=Constantine M.|journal=Langmuir|volume=23|issue=5|pages=2311–4|pmid=17266345}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opens up the possibility of creating composite fibers which can function as drug delivery systems or possess the ability to self-heal upon failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=14568403|year=2003|last1=Zeng|first1=J|last2=Xu|first2=X|last3=Chen|first3=X|last4=Liang|first4=Q|last5=Bian|first5=X|last6=Yang|first6=L|last7=Jing|first7=X|title=Biodegradable electrospun fibers for drug delivery|volume=92|issue=3|pages=227–31|journal=Journal of Controlled Release|doi=10.1016/S0168-3659(03)00372-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/C2JM15696B|title=Encapsulation of self-healing materials by coelectrospinning, emulsion electrospinning, solution blowing and intercalation|year=2012|last1=Sinha-Ray|first1=S.|last2=Pelot|first2=D.

===Coaxial electrospinning===
[[File:Rame-hart coaxial spinneret.jpg|thumb|A stainless steel coaxial spinneret manufactered by ramé-hart instrument co., Succasunna, NJ.]]
A coaxial setup uses a dual-solution feed system which allows for the injection of one solution into another at the tip of the [[Spinneret (polymers)|spinneret]]. The sheath fluid is believed to act as a carrier which draws in the inner fluid at the Taylor Cone of the electrospinning jet.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; If the solutions are immiscible then a core shell structure is usually observed. Miscible solutions however can result in porosity or a fiber with distinct phases due to phase separation during solidification of the fiber. For more advanced setups, a triaxial or quadaxial (tetra-axial) [[Spinneret (polymers)|spinneret]] can be used with multiple solutions.

===Emulsion electrospinning===
Emulsions can be used to create core shell or composite fibers without modification of the spinneret. However, these fibers are usually more difficult to produce as compared to coaxial spinning due to the greater number of variables which must be accounted for in creating the emulsion. A water phase and an immiscible solvent phase are mixed in the presence of an emulsifying agent to form the emulsion. Any agent which stabilizes the interface between the immiscible phases can be used. Surfactants such as [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]], Triton and [[nanoparticles]] have been used successfully. During the electrospinning process the emulsion droplets within the fluid are stretched and gradually confined leading to their coalescence. If the [[volume fraction]] of inner fluid is sufficiently high, a continuous inner core can be formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Electrospinning of blends is a variation of this technique which uses the fact that polymers are generally immiscible with each and can phase segregate without the use of surfactants. This method can be simplified further if a solvent which dissolves both polymers is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Electrospun nanofiber reinforced and toughened composites through in situ nano-interface formation|journal=Composites Science and Technology |volume=68 |year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.compscitech.2008.08.033|pages= 3322–3329|url=http://ss.bjmu.edu.cn/departments/tsg/Search/sci/sci-paper/2008sci/2008-dengxuliang-Electrospun%20nanofiber%20reinforced%20and%20toughened%20composites%20through%20in%20situ%20nano-interface%20formation.pdf|last1=Lin|first1=Song|last2=Cai|first2=Qing|last3=Ji|first3=Jianying|last4=Sui|first4=Gang|last5=Yu|first5=Yunhua|last6=Yang|first6=Xiaoping|last7=Ma|first7=Qi.|last8=Wei|first8=Yan|last9=Deng|first9=Xuliang|issue=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Melt electrospinning===
{{main|Melt electrospinning}}
Electrospinning of polymer melts eliminates the need for volatile solvents in solution electrospinning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nagy, Z.K. |author2=Balogh, A. |author3=Drávavölgyi, G. |author4=Ferguson, J. |author5=Pataki, H. |author6=Vajna, B. |author7=Marosi, G. |title=Solvent-free melt electrospinning for preparation of fast dissolving drug delivery system and comparison with solvent-based electrospun and melt extruded systems|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences|year=2013|volume=102|doi=10.1002/jps.23374|pmid=23161110 |issue=2|pages=508–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Semi crystalline polymer fibers such as [[polyethylene|PE]], [[polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] and [[polypropylene|PP]], which would otherwise be impossible or very difficult to create using solution spinning, can be created. The setup is very similar to that employed in conventional electrospinning and includes the use of a syringe or spinneret, a high voltage supply and the collector. The polymer melt is usually produced by heating from either resistance heating, circulating fluids, air heating or lasers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/asia.201000436|pmid=21080400|title=Melt Electrospinning|year=2011|last1=Hutmacher|first1=Dietmar W.|last2=Dalton|first2=Paul D.|journal=Chemistry: An Asian Journal|volume=6|issue=1|pages=44–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the high viscosity of polymer melts, the fiber diameters are usually slightly larger than those obtained from solution electrospinning. The fiber uniformity upon achieving stable flow rates and thermal equilibrium, tends to be very good. The whipping instability which is the predominant stage in which the fiber is stretched for spinning from solutions can be absent from the process due to the low melt conductivity and high viscosity of the melt. The most significant factors which affect the fiber size tend to be the feed rate, the molecular weight of the polymer and the diameter of the spinneret. Fiber sizes ranging from ~250&amp;nbsp;nm to several hundreds of [[micrometre|micrometers]] have been created thus far with the lower sizes being achieved using low molecular weight polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.polymer.2007.09.037 |url=http://med-x.sjtu.edu.cn/daltonlab/Literature/Dalton%20et%20al%20%28melt%20espinning%29.pdf |title=Electrospinning of polymer melts: Phenomenological observations |year=2007 |last1=Dalton |first1=Paul D. |last2=Grafahrend |first2=Dirk |last3=Klinkhammer |first3=Kristina |last4=Klee |first4=Doris |last5=Möller |first5=Martin |journal=Polymer |volume=48 |issue=23 |pages=6823–6833 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221223838/http://med-x.sjtu.edu.cn/daltonlab/Literature/Dalton%20et%20al%20%28melt%20espinning%29.pdf |archivedate=December 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the late 16th century [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]]&lt;ref name=gilbert&gt;Gilbert, W. (1628) De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure (On the Magnet and Magnetic Bodies, and on That Great Magnet the Earth), London, Peter Short.&lt;/ref&gt; set out to describe the behavior of magnetic and electrostatic phenomena. He observed that when a suitably electrically charged piece of amber was brought near a droplet of water it would form a cone shape and small droplets would be ejected from the tip of the cone: this is the first recorded observation of [[electrospray]]ing.

In 1887 [[C. V. Boys]] described ''“the old, but little known experiment of electrical spinning”''. Boys’ apparatus consisted of ''“a small dish, insulated and connected with an electrical machine”''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Boys, C. V. |doi=10.1088/1478-7814/9/1/303|title=On the Production, Properties, and some suggested Uses of the Finest Threads|year=1887|journal=Proceedings of the Physical Society |volume=9|pages=8–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that as his stock liquid reached the edge of the dish, that he could draw fibers from a number of materials including [[shellac]], [[beeswax]], [[Sealing wax|sealing-wax]], [[gutta-percha]] and [[collodion]].

The process of electrospinning was patented by J.F. Cooley in May 1900&lt;ref name=cooley&gt;Cooley, J.F. Patent GB 06385 "Improved methods of and apparatus for electrically separating the relatively volatile liquid component from the component of relatively fixed substances of composite fluids" 19th May 1900&lt;/ref&gt; and February 1902&lt;ref&gt;Cooley, J. F. ''et al.'' "Apparatus for electrically dispersing fluids" {{US Patent|692631}} Issue date: February 4, 1902&lt;/ref&gt; and by W.J. Morton in July 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, W.J. ''et al.'' "Method of dispersing fluids" {{US Patent|0705691}} Issue date: July 29, 1902&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914 [[John Zeleny]], published work on the behavior of fluid droplets at the end of metal capillaries.&lt;ref name=Zeleny&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zeleny, J. |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.3.69|title=The Electrical Discharge from Liquid Points, and a Hydrostatic Method of Measuring the Electric Intensity at Their Surfaces|year=1914|journal=Physical Review|volume=3|issue=2|pages=69–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His effort began the attempt to mathematically model the behavior of fluids under electrostatic forces.
 
Further developments toward commercialization were made by Anton Formhals, and described in a sequence of patents from 1934&lt;ref&gt;Formhals, Anton ''et al.'' "Process and apparatus for preparing artificial threads" {{US Patent|1975504}} Issue date: October 2, 1934&lt;/ref&gt; to 1944&lt;ref&gt;Formhals, Anton ''et al.'' "Method and apparatus for spinning" {{US Patent|2349950}} Issue date: May 30, 1944&lt;/ref&gt; for the fabrication of textile yarns. Electrospinning from a melt rather than a solution was patented by C.L. Norton in 1936&lt;ref&gt;Norton, C.L. "Method and apparatus for producing fibrous or filamentary material" {{US Patent|2048651}} Issue date: July 21, 1936&lt;/ref&gt; using an air-blast to assist fiber formation.

In 1938 Nathalie D. Rozenblum and Igor V. Petryanov-Sokolov,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

By 1939, this work had led to the establishment of a factory in [[Tver']] for the manufacture of electrospun smoke filter elements for gas masks. The material, dubbed BF (Battlefield Filter) was spun from [[cellulose acetate]] in a solvent mixture of [[dichloroethane]] and [[ethanol]]. By the 1960s output of spun filtration material was claimed as 20 million m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per annum&lt;ref name=filatov&gt;Filatov, Y. Budyka, A. Kirichenko, V. (Trans. D.

Between 1964 and 1969 [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor|Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor]] produced the theoretical underpinning of electrospinning.&lt;ref name=Taylor1964&gt;{{cite journal|author=Taylor, G. |doi=10.1098/rspa.1964.0151|jstor=2415876|title=Disintegration of Water Drops in an Electric Field|year=1964|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A|volume=280|issue=1382|pages=383–397}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor1965&gt;{{cite journal|author=Taylor, G. |doi=10.1098/rspa.1966.0085|title=The Force Exerted by an Electric Field on a Long Cylindrical Conductor|year=1966|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A|volume=291|issue=1425|pages=145–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor1969&gt;{{cite journal|author=Taylor, G. |doi=10.1098/rspa.1969.0205 |jstor=2416488|title=Electrically Driven Jets|year=1969|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A|volume=313|issue=1515|pages=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor’s work contributed to electrospinning by mathematically modeling the shape of the cone formed by the fluid droplet under the effect of an electric field; this characteristic droplet shape is now known as the Taylor cone. He further worked with J. R. Melcher to develop the "leaky dielectric model" for conducting fluids.&lt;ref name=MelcherTaylor&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Melcher, J.

Simon, in a 1988 NIH SBIR grant report, showed that solution electrospinning could be used to produced nano- and submicron-scale polystyrene and polycarbonate fibrous mats specifically intended for use as in vitro cell substrates. This early application of electrospun fibrous lattices for cell culture and tissue engineering showed that various cell types would adhere to and proliferate upon the fibers in vitro. Small changes in the surface chemistry of the fibers were also observed depending upon the polarity of the electric field during spinning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317053872|title=NIH PHASE I FINAL REPORT: FIBROUS SUBSTRATES FOR CELL CULTURE (R3RR03544A) (PDF Download Available)|last=Simon|first=Eric M.|date=1988|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s several research groups  (notably that of Reneker and Rutledge who popularised the name ''electrospinning'' for the process)&lt;ref name="Doshi and Reneker"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Doshi, J.  |author2=Reneker, D. H. |doi=10.1016/0304-3886(95)00041-8|title=Electrospinning process and applications of electrospun fibers|year=1995|journal=Journal of Electrostatics|volume=35|issue=2–3|pages=151–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that many [[organic compound|organic]] polymers could be electrospun into [[nanofiber]]s. Since then, the number of publications about electrospinning has been increasing exponentially every year.&lt;ref name="reinventing the wheel" /&gt;

Since 1995 there have been further theoretical developments of the driving mechanisms of the electrospinning process. Reznik ''et al.'' described the shape of the Taylor cone and the subsequent ejection of a fluid jet.&lt;ref name=reznik2004&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reznik, S. N.|author2=Yarin, A.

==Uses==

The size of an electrospun fiber can be in the nano scale and the fibers may possess nano scale surface texture, leading to different modes of interaction with other materials compared with macroscale materials.&lt;ref name="ajayan"&gt;Ajayan P. M., Schadler, L. S. and Braun, P. V. (2003) Nanocomposite Science and Technology, Weinheim, Wiley-VCH, {{ISBN|9783527602124}}, {{DOI|10.1002/3527602127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, the ultra-fine fibers produced by electrospinning are expected to have two main properties, a very high surface to volume ratio, and a relatively defect free structure at the molecular level. This first property makes electrospun material suitable for activities requiring a high degree of physical contact, such as providing sites for chemical reactions, or the capture of small sized particulate material by physical entanglement – filtration. The second property should allow electrospun fibers to approach the theoretical maximum strength of the spun material, opening up the possibility of making high mechanical performance [[composite materials]].

===Filtration===
[[Image:LycopodiumPVOH.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Lycopodium club moss spores (diameter about 60 micrometers) captured on an electrospun polyvinyl alcohol fiber]]
The use of nanofiber webs as a filtering medium is well established. Due to the small size of the fibers [[van der Waals force|London-Van Der Waals forces]] are an important method of adhesion between the fibers and the captured materials. Polymeric nanofibers have been used in air filtration applications for more than seven decades.&lt;ref name="filatov" /&gt;&lt;ref name=donaldson&gt;[http://www.donaldson.com/en/filtermedia/nanofibers/. Donaldson Nanofiber Products&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710143633/http://www.donaldson.com/en/filtermedia/nanofibers/ |date=2011-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of poor bulk mechanical properties of thin nanowebs, they are laid over a filtration medium substrate. The small fiber diameters cause slip flows at fiber surfaces, causing an increase in the interception and inertial impaction efficiencies of these composite filter media. The enhanced filtration efficiency at the same pressure drop is possible with fibers having diameters less than 0.5 micrometer.  Since the essential properties of protective clothing are high moisture vapor transport, increased fabric breath-ability, and enhanced toxic chemical resistance, electrospun nanofiber membranes are good candidates for these applications.&lt;ref name="Nanofiber filtration"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/app.21481|title=Electrospinning of nanofibers|year=2005|last1=Subbiah|first1=Thandavamoorthy|last2=Bhat|first2=G.

===Textile manufacturing===
The majority of early patents for electrospinning were for textile applications, however little woven fabric was actually produced, perhaps due to difficulties in handling the barely visible fibers. However, electrospinning has the potential to produce seamless non-woven garments by integrating advanced manufacturing with fiber electrospinning. This would introduce multi-functionality (flame, chemical, environmental protection) by blending fibers into electrospinlaced (using electrospinning to combine different fibers and coatings to form three-dimensional shapes, such as [[clothing]])&lt;ref name="textile as barrier"&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1177/0040517507080284|title= Use of Electrospun Nanofiber Web for Protective Textile Materials as Barriers to Liquid Penetration|year= 2007|last1= Lee|first1= S.|last2= Obendorf|first2= S.

Application is limited by difficulties in making sufficient quantities of fiber to make substantial large scale articles in a reasonable time scale. For this reason medical applications requiring relatively small amounts of fiber are a popular area of application for electrospun fiber reinforced materials.

Electrospinning is being investigated as a source of cost-effective, easy to manufacture wound dressings, medical implants, and scaffolds for the production of artificial human tissues. These scaffolds fulfill a similar purpose as the [[extracellular matrix]] in natural tissue. Biodegradable polymers, such as [[polycaprolactone]], are typically used for this purpose. These fibers may then be coated with [[collagen]] to promote cell attachment, although collagen has successfully been spun directly into membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Matthews J.

Electrospun fibers may have potential as a surface for [[enzyme]]s to be immobilized on. These enzymes could be used to break down toxic chemicals in the environment, among other things.&lt;ref name="reinventing the wheel"/&gt;

== Mass production ==
Thus far, at least seven countries in the world have companies which provide industrial-level and laboratory-scale electrospinning machines: three companies in [[Czech Republic]], two each in [[Iran]], [[Japan]], and [[Spain]], and one each in the [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Electrospinning Mass Production Machine Providers|url = http://electrospintech.com/massproductionmachine.html#.VpjsjlR9603|website = electrospintech.com|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1717">The '''Enron Code of Ethics''' was a 64-page booklet published by [[Enron]] Corporation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mishkenot.org.il/Hebrew/docs/ethics/%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%90%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%A9%D7%9C%20%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%A2%D7%A1%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D/Enron%20Code%20Of%20Ethics.pdf] Scan of the complete book by [[The Smoking Gun]]&lt;/ref&gt; the last known edition of which was in July 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/enrons-code-ethics] Article and scans of the book on [[The Smoking Gun]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sale of copies of the booklet on [[Ebay]] has passed into internet folklore. 
An article in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' for February 10, 2002 reported a final bid level on one copy of USD 202.50. 
Another sale on Ebay (which ran from February 13 to February 20, 2002) carried the item number "1074129276". In the latter sale, the booklet was sold together with a cup, also allegedly an Enron product, which featured text extolling the virtues of the Enron retirement plan.

The content of the booklet has attracted less interest than the fact that Enron had a code of ethics.

'''FOCUS''' is a [[fourth-generation programming language]] (4GL) [[computer programming]] [[programming language|language]] and development environment that is used to build [[database]] queries. Produced by [[Information Builders]] Inc., it was originally developed for data handling and analysis on the [[IBM mainframe]]. Subsequently versions for minicomputers and such as the [[VAX]] and other [[computer platform|platforms]]&lt;ref&gt;including UNIX&lt;/ref&gt; were implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper  |newspaper=Computerworld |date=March 5, 1990 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cX3dYiZfXe8C  
|title=FOCUS 4GL from Information Builders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper  |newspaper=Computerworld  |date=March 31, 1986 |page=52 
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nvgwHu6zOfQC  |title=Information Builders Focus/VAX}}&lt;/reF&gt; FOCUS was later extended to [[personal computers]] and (in 1997) to the [[World Wide Web]]: the [[WebFOCUS]] product.

==History==
[[Information Builders]]'s FOCUS product began as an alternate product to [[Mathematica]]'s [[RAMIS (software)|RAMIS]], the first Fourth-generation_programming_language]] (4GL).

[[National CSS]] (NCSS), a [[Time-sharing]] vendor, licensed rights to make RAMIS available on its [[VP/CSS]] system.&lt;ref name=ConfCall&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Oral_History/RAMIS_and_NOMAD/RAMIS_and_NOMAD.National_CSS.oral_history.2005.102658182.pdf  
|title=RAMIS and NOMAD--National CSS  |date= May 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point Mathematica changed its licensing price.&lt;ref name=IEEE.Change&gt;{{cite web
|title=The History of NOMAD: A Fourth Generation Language
|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6774378  |author=Nick Rawlings |date=March 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interested parties were:&lt;ref name=ConfCall/&gt;
* NCSS, which was marketing RAMIS (and other products) for use on their time-sharing system
* Mathematica, owner of RAMIS
* Key developers/programmers of RAMIS
** some stayed with Mathematica
** others left to form the company that became Information Builders, known for its FOCUS product

===Relation to other 4GLs===
RAMIS was the direct ancestor of FOCUS. 

Gerald D. Cohen and Peter Mittelman were the principal developers of RAMIS while working at [[Mathematica]] Products Group in 1970. RAMIS was licensed by Mathematica to a number of in-house clients (including [[Nabisco]] and [[AT&amp;T Corporation]]), and was also offered by the [[National CSS]] timesharing company. In&lt;ref&gt;1970 or&lt;/ref&gt; October of 1975&lt;ref name=Leaving&gt;{{cite web
|title=A Brief History of Fourth Generation Languages |url=http://www.decosta.com/Nomad/tales/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen left Mathematica and formed Information Builders, after which he recreated the product he had built at Mathematica in the form of FOCUS,
which was very similar to RAMIS: "the same bugs and the same misspelled error messages."&lt;ref name=ConfCall/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;also Per Nick Rawlings' "A Brief History of Fourth Generation Languages"&lt;/ref&gt;

The syntax of FOCUS in its simplest elements is almost a direct clone of the syntax of RAMIS bearing a resemblance similar to the differences between various early dialects of SQL. At the same time, NCSS decided to work on its own product, later called [[NOMAD]]. All three products flourished during the 1970s and early 1980s, with FOCUS also being offered on a time-sharing basis via
[[Tymeshare]].&lt;ref name=ConfCall/&gt;

Mathematica's time ran out in the mid-80s, and NCSS also failed, a victim of the personal computing revolution which obviated commercial timesharing. 

RAMIS was sold to a series of companies, ultimately landing with [[Computer Associates]]. NOMAD suffered a similar fate. FOCUS, under Cohen's direction, continued to flourish by expanding their product line.

Loosely competitive with [[SAS Institute|SAS]],&lt;ref&gt;A consultant wrote: "When I investigated translating SAS to the WebFOCUS BI product 
(based on a 4GL programming language), I personally considered some of the following SAS features as stumbling blocks" and he listed 11 items. {{cite web |url=http://bi-software.blogspot.com/2012/04/modernizing-sas-bi.html |title=Business Intelligence Software}}&lt;/ref&gt; FOCUS never quite reached the same degree of mainstream adoption, perhaps because it had only basic analytical and statistical functions and lacked the wide array of specialized analytic tools which made SAS the standard in fields such as pharmaceutical [[clinical trials]]. Instead, FOCUS concentrated on extreme flexibility in data import and export as well as ad hoc [[end-user]] reporting.

==Description==
Although FOCUS resembles other data access and analysis tools, such as [[SQL]] and [[SAS System|SAS]], it also includes report and chart display and presentation features. It automates the process of identifying files to the [[operating system]], opening the input file, reading the next record, opening the output file, writing the next record, and closing the files. This basic operation allows the user/programmer to concentrate on the details of working with the data within each record, in effect working almost entirely within an implicit [[program loop]] that runs for each record, somewhat like [[IBM RPG|RPG (Report Program Generator)]]. Other procedures operate on the dataset as a whole, for instance printing or [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and merely require the user/programmer to identify the dataset.

Compared to [[general-purpose programming language]]s, this structure allows the user/programmer to be less familiar with the technical details of the data and how it is stored, and relatively more familiar with the information contained in the data. This blurs the line between user and programmer, appealing to individuals whose work roles are in business or research rather than [[information technology]]. This in turn has the double edged result of allowing rapid answers to business or research questions, even ones requiring several [[iteration]]s to get from the initial results to a final answer; but also can contribute to the construction of a large body of poorly written and/or difficult to maintain [[source code]].
&lt;!--caution ... the above needs good sourcing, which I'll look for, but in the meantime it does come close to BUT NOT BEING "OR" --&gt;

===Master File Description (MFD)===
A feature that was unique at the time is that FOCUS features the ability for the user to construct a data description file (called a "master file description")&lt;ref name=Tripod&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://members.tripod.com/focus_site/mfd.html
|title=MASTER  FILE  DESCRIPTION (MFD)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Synopsis FOCUS: File Definition describes the components of a Master File Description. Audience This course is for the data processing and business professional who uses FOCUS." {{cite web
|title=FOCUS: File Definition |url=http://www.intersurf.com/dpec/webpromo/catalog/foc301.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the actual data file, or even several different data description files addressing the same data file in different ways, rather than the usual practice of having the file structure hard-coded into the program. 

In this way, files of any structure from any source can be accessed or produced in many different ways, eliminating much of the data manipulation (for example concatenation, or parsing) at times required with other earlier programming languages. For instance, the same actual data file can be accessed (read or write) as each record being an 80 byte text string, or as 40 2 character numerical fields, other as 10 8-byte floating point numbers, etc., by the user simply re-writing the appropriate master file description as needed.

==WebFOCUS==
In 1997,&lt;ref&gt;"Introduced in 1997, ..." {{cite web |title=WebFOCUS
|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/54375/webfocus}}&lt;/ref&gt; a web-based version of FOCUS was introduced called "WebFOCUS" which built on the data access and reporting foundation of FOCUS, expanding these to a visually oriented thin-client paradigm accessible from any [[web browser]].

WebFOCUS's language has both a "procedural" and "non-procedural" command structure.  The former is for more immediate execution, whereas the latter "are placed into a stack of memory for later execution."&lt;ref name=BI.jack&gt;{{cite web ||title=BI Software - WebFOCUS  
|url=http://bi-software-webfocus.blogspot.com/2011/11/new-webfocus-feature-to-ignore-your-bi.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first fair ground in Milan was opened in 1906, as the area of a [[World's fair]], and in time for the opening of the [[Simplon Tunnel]]. The fairground at that time extended over the current area and the nearby Sempione Park.

In 1923 the fairground, at that time ''Fiera Campionaria'', was moved permanently in the historical zone, of which Fieramilanocity now occupies a part. Western wing opened in 1997, in place of the old [[Alfa Romeo]] factory at ''Portello''.

Since 2000, the infrastructure is managed by the new company Fiera Milano SpA and in 2005 the new Fieramilano opened in Rho. The old fairground in Milan was partially dismantled between 2007 and 2008.

'''Fieramilanocity''' is Milan's old trade fair, located near the city center. The current area is only a part of the historic fairground, since a big portion has been dismantled between 2007 and 2008 to make room for the new ''[[CityLife (Milan)|CityLife]]'' residential and business district. The area is served by [[Milan Metro]] and by the [[Milan Suburban Railway Network|suburban railway]].

Even though the big part of the fairground has been moved to Rho, ''FieraMilanoCity'' continues to host smaller exhibitions with more limited logistical requirements, in addition to events that cannot be held outside the city.

==MiCo==
'''MiCo''' (Milano Congressi) is currently the largest congress center in Europe,&lt;ref name=mico&gt;{{cite web|title=MiCo - Milano Congressi|url=http://www.micmilano.it/ChiSiamo_it.html|publisher=Fiera Milano|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mico2&gt;{{cite web|title=MiCo - Il centro congressi più grande d'Europa|url=http://www.micmilano.it/SpaziORG_it.html|publisher=Fiera Milano|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a capacity of up to 18,000 in 70 different conference rooms.&lt;ref name=mico2 /&gt;

The '''Islamic Reporting Initiative''' (IRI) is an independent [[Nonprofit organization|not-for-profit organization]] leading the creation of the IRI standard; the guiding [[Integrated reporting|integrated]] Corporate [[Sustainability]] and Social Responsibility ([[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]]) [[Sustainability reporting|reporting]] standard based on [[Five Pillars of Islam|Islamic principles and values]] that works towards achieving [[international standards]] of best practice. The framework will enable organizations to inclusively assess, report, verify and certify their CSR and [[Philanthropy|philanthropic]] programs supporting the [[Sustainable Development Goals|United Nations Sustainable Development Goals]].

Founded on 4 April 2015, the IRI seeks to make CSR reporting standard practice in organizations across the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] and [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]] countries in particular. The IRI is headquartered in [[The Netherlands]], and (as of 2016) has members in more than 50 countries.&lt;ref&gt;https://islamicreporting.org/sign-up/members/list-of-members-per-country/&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2015, the IRI was commended by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the second largest inter-governmental organization after the [[United Nations]], with membership of 57 states over four continents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oic-oci.org/oicv2/states/?lan=en&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vision and Mission ==
The [[Goal|vision]] of the IRI is a sustainable [[global economy]] that contributes actively to [[society]] and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] integrating the values of [[peace]], [[compassion]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[righteousness]], [[environmental stewardship]] and [[human dignity]] into [[corporate culture]].

The [[mission statement|mission]] of the IRI is to enable organizations throughout [[the world]] to examine the values that guide their [[activities (disambiguation)|activities]] and express with [[Transparency (behavior)|clarity]] and [[simplicity]] their contribution to sustainability in society and the environment.

The IRI aims to provide a range of internationally recognized [[business]] tools, [[guidelines]] and standards to accelerate the mainstream [[implementation]] of the shared post-2015 goals as outlined in both the OIC-2025 plan of action and the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030.

== Overview ==
The IRI was created in response to [[research]] that identified low rates of sustainability and CSR reporting despite a [[prevalence]] of sustainability and CSR practice in organizations where Islamic principles and values are an important element of [[corporate culture]]. Such findings indicate that existing sustainability [[Sustainability standards and certification|reporting standards]], such as the [[Global Reporting Initiative|Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)]] and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO Standards]], among others, are not always as practical or relevant in a local and cultural context.

The IRI is a culturally-responsive reporting framework based on [[Five Pillars of Islam|Islamic principles]] and values and the embedded widespread practice of [[philanthropy]]. Such values shape [[organizational culture]]s and ground CSR as an economic and moral [[initiative]], founded on the understanding that an organization aspires to be a ‘[[Corporate Citizenship|good corporate citizen]]’. The framework will be compatible with elements specific to the culture, such as [[Zakat]] and other organizational [[Code of conduct|codes of conduct]]. At the same time, the IRI framework will be compatible with [[Sharia-compliant finance|Sharia compliant finance]], one of the fastest growing types of [[finance]]:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2015/09/prasad.htm&lt;/ref&gt; between 2009 and 2013 Islamic banking assets grew at an annual rate of 17.6%, and are expected to grow annually by an average of 19.7% until 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21617014-market-islamic-financial-products-growing-fast-big-interest-no-interest&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, the IRI was recognized by the Cambridge IF Analytica Global Islamic Finance Report (GIFR) as one of the leading initiatives in Islamic Finance in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://gifr.net/publications/gifr2017/contributors.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRI deems the need for CSR reporting to be culturally-responsive in order to maximize the nuances that lend themselves to the overall ambition of CSR and to maximize [[stakeholder engagement]]. With CSR reports primarily used by stakeholders, it is important that the motivations for CSR practice are framed within the local context and use a [[language]] that is familiar, meaningful and relatable to [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.makingitmagazine.net/?p=9128&lt;/ref&gt; Once such a framework "fits into its place", it creates stable, [[flourishing]] and interconnected [[Economy|economic]], social and [[Culture|cultural]] environments.

The IRI enables CSR and sustainability metrics to be incorporated into wider [[Business practices|business practice]] through the integrated nature of the framework. [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] and [[sustainability reporting]] is a concept encouraging businesses and institutions to report on their social and [[Environmental Performance Index|environmental performance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herzig|first=Christian|title=Corporate Sustainability Reporting.

==Background==
Born at Cardross, Scotland on 30 March 1662, a younger son of [[David Erskine, 2nd Lord Cardross]], by his secone wife, Mary Bruce, daughter of Sir George Bruce of Carnock.&lt;ref&gt;''Publications of the Scottish History Society, Volume 14'' p. xiii T. and A.

==Career==
Erskine's strongly [[Church of Scotland|Presbyterian]] sympathies led him to choose the winning sides during the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and the deliberations prior to the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]] of 1707.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Joseph ''Members of Parliament, Scotland: Including the Minor Barons, the Commissioners for the Shires, and the Commissioners for the Burghs, 1357-1882,'' p. 128.

A '''lead time''' is the [[:wikt:latency|latency]] between the initiation and execution of a process. For example, the lead time between the placement of an order and delivery of a new car from a manufacturer may be anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 months.

==Journalism==
Lead time in [[publishing]] describes the amount of time that a [[journalist]] has between receiving a writing assignment and submitting the completed piece.  Depending on the publication, lead times can be anything from a couple of hours to many months/years.

==Medicine==
Lead time (when referring to a disease) is the length of time between detection of a disease through screening and the moment in time where it would have normally presented with symptoms and led to a diagnosis. An example of this is seen with breast cancer population screening, where women who are asymptomatic have a positive test result with mammography, whereas the underlying disease would have taken many more years to manifest.

==Supply chain management==
A more conventional definition of lead time in the [[supply chain management]] realm is the time from the moment the customer places an order (the moment the supplier learns of the requirement) to the moment it is ready for delivery. In the absence of [[finished goods]] or intermediate (work in progress) inventory, it is the time it takes to actually manufacture the order without any inventory other than raw materials. The [[Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply]] identifies "total lead time" as a combination of "internal lead time" (the time required for the buying organisation's internal processes to progress from identification of a need to the issue of a [[purchase order]]) and "external lead time" (the time required for the supplying organisation's processes, including any [[New product development|development]] required, manufacture, despatch and delivery).&lt;ref&gt;CIPS in partnership with Profex Publishing, ''Procurement and Supply Operations'', 2012, revised 2016, pp. 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing==
In the manufacturing environment, lead time has the same definition as that of Supply Chain Management, but it includes the time required to ship the parts from the supplier.  The shipping time is included because the manufacturing company needs to know when the parts will be available for [[material requirements planning]].  It is also possible for lead time to include the time it takes for a company to process and have the part ready for manufacturing once it has been received.  The time it takes a company to unload a product from a truck, inspect it, and move it into storage is non-trivial.  With tight manufacturing constraints or when a company is using [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] manufacturing it is important for supply chain to know how long their own internal processes take.

Lead time is made of:&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.supply-chain-consultant.eu/10/lead-time-supply-chain/ ''Lead Times'']. "Lead times in supply chain" Supply Chain Consultant Website.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Preprocessing Lead Time''' (also known as "planning time" or "paperwork"): It represents the time required to release a purchase order (if you buy an item) or create a job (if you manufacture an item) from the time you learn of the requirement.
* '''Processing Lead Time''': It is the time required to procure or manufacture an item.
* '''Postprocessing Lead Time''': It represents the time to make a purchased item available in inventory from the time you receive it (including quarantine, inspection, etc.)

'''Example'''

Company A needs a part that can be manufactured in two days once Company B has received an order.  It takes three days for company A to receive the part once shipped, and one additional day before the part is ready to go into manufacturing.
*If Company A's Supply Chain calls Company B they will be quoted a lead time of 2 days for the part.
*If Company A's Manufacturing division asks the Supply Chain division what the lead time is, they will be quoted 5 days since shipping will be included.
*If a line worker asks the Manufacturing Division boss what the lead time is before the part is ready to be used, it will be 6 days because setup time will be included.

'''In more detail'''

Lead Time terminology has been defined in greater detail.&lt;ref&gt;Rajaniemi, J. (2012) [http://www.leadtimes.org/ ''www.leadtimes.org''] Lead Time Terminology in Manufacturing.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supply Chain from customer order received to the moment the order is delivered is divided into five lead times.
* '''Order Lead Time''' - Time from customer order received to customer order delivered.
* '''Order Handling Time''' - Time from customer order received to sales order created.
* '''Manufacturing Lead Time''' - Time from sales order created to production finished (ready for delivery).
* '''Production Lead Time''' - Time from start of physical production of first submodule/part to production finished (ready for delivery).
* '''Delivery Lead Time''' - Time from production finished to customer order delivered.

'''Example '''

A restaurant opens up and a customer walks in. A waiter guides him to a table, gives him the menu and asks what he would like to order. The customer selects a dish and the waiter writes it in his notepad. At that moment the customer has made an order which the restaurant has accepted – Order Lead Time and Order Handling Time have begun. Now the waiter marks the order in the cash register, rips the paper from the notepad, takes it into the kitchen and puts into the order queue. The order has been handled and is waiting in the factory (kitchen) for manufacturing. As there are no other customers, the waiter decides to stand outside the kitchen, by the door, waiting for the dish to be prepared and begins calculating Manufacturing Lead Time.

Meanwhile, the chef finishes what he was doing, takes the order from the queue, starts his clock as a mark for the start of Production Lead Time and begins cooking. The chef chops the vegetables, fries the meat and boils the pasta. When the dish is ready, the chef rings a bell and stops his clock. At the same time the waiter stops calculating Manufacturing Lead Time and rushes through the kitchen door to get the food while it is hot.

When he picks it up, begins counting of Delivery Lead Time that ends when the dish is served to the customer, who can now happily say that the Order Lead Time was shorter than he had expected.

==Order lead time==
When talking about Order Lead Time (OLT) it is important to differentiate the definitions that may exist around this concept. Although they look similar there are differences between them that help the industry to model the order behavior of their customers. The four definitions are : 
*The '''Actual Order Lead Time ''' (OLT&lt;sub&gt;Actual&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, A. (1989). Component inventory costs in an assembly problem with uncertain supplier lead-times. IIE transactions, 21(2), 112-121.&lt;/ref&gt; The order lead-time'', refers to the time which elapses between the receipt of the customer's order (Order Entry Date) and the  '''''delivery''''' of the goods."&lt;ref&gt;Gunasekaran, A., Patel, C., &amp;  Tirtiroglu, E., 2001  "Performance measures and metrics in a supply chain environment." International journal of operations &amp; production Management 21, no. 1/2: 71-87.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The '''Requested Order Lead Time ''' (OLT&lt;sub&gt;Requested&lt;/sub&gt;) represents the time between the Order Entry Date and the customer '''''requested''''' delivery date; this measurement could help the company to understand the order behavior of the customers and help to design profitable models to fulfill customer needs.&lt;ref&gt;2)Cousens, A., Szwejczewski, M., &amp; Sweeney, M. 2009. "A process for managing manufacturing flexibility." International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management, 29(4), pp.357-385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Silva, L., 2013, "Supply Chain Contract Compliance Measurements" Master thesis (work in progress), Aalto University, Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''Quote Order Lead Time ''' (OLT&lt;sub&gt;Quote&lt;/sub&gt;) is the '''''agreed'' ''' time between the Order Entry Date and the supplier’s committed deliver date of goods as stipulated in a supply chain contract.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;
*The '''Confirmed Order Lead Time''' (OLT&lt;sub&gt;Confirmed&lt;/sub&gt;) represents the time between the Order Entry Date and the by the supplier '''''confirmed''''' delivery date of goods.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

[[Image:OLT Definitions.jpg|thumb|OLT Definitions&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;]]

=== OLT formulas ===
*OLT&lt;sub&gt;Requested&lt;/sub&gt; = Wish Date – Order Entry Date
The OLT&lt;sub&gt;Requested&lt;/sub&gt; will be determined by the difference between the date the customer wants the material in his facilities (wish date) and the date when they provided its order to the supplier. 
*OLT&lt;sub&gt;Quote&lt;/sub&gt; = Quote Date – Order Entry Date
The OLT&lt;sub&gt;Quote&lt;/sub&gt; will be determined by the difference between the date the customer agree to receive the material in their facilities (Quote date) and the date when the order is provided to the supplier.
*OLT&lt;sub&gt;Actual&lt;/sub&gt; = Delivery Date – Order Entry Date
The OLT&lt;sub&gt;Actual&lt;/sub&gt; will be determined by the difference between the day the provider deliver the material (Delivery date) and the date when they enter the order in the system. 
*OLT&lt;sub&gt;Confirmed&lt;/sub&gt; = Confirmed Date – Order Entry Date
The OLT&lt;sub&gt;Confirmed&lt;/sub&gt; will be determined by the difference between the date the confirmed date by the provider to deliver the material in the customer facilities (Confirmed date) and the date when they provide the order to the supplier.

===Average OLT based on volume===
The Average OLT based on Volume (OLT&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;) is the addition of all the multiplications between the volume of product we deliver (quantity) and the OLT divided by the total quantity delivered in the period of time we are studying for that specific facility.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;OLTV= \frac{\sum_{j}{Quantity_j \cdot OLT_j}}{_{Total Quantity Deliver}} \,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
By doing this the company will be able to find a relation of volume weighted between the quantities of material required for an order and the time requested to accomplish it. The volume metric could be applied to the 4 types of OLT. &lt;br /&gt;
The figure obtained from this calculation will be the average time (e.g. in days) between order placing and the requested delivery date of a specific customer under consideration of the average quantities ordered during that particular time.

===Potential application areas for order lead time measurement===
The correct analysis of OLT will give the company:
*Better understanding of the market behavior making it able to develop more profitable schemas that fit better with customer needs (Revenue Management).
*Increases company ability to detect and correct any behavior that is not within terms agreed in the contract (by penalization or different contract schema).  
*The OLT measurement creates an opportunity area to improve the customer relations by increasing the level of communication with them.

==Project management==
In [[project management]] lead time is the time it takes to complete a task or a set of interdependent tasks. The lead of the entire [[project]] would be the overall duration of the [[critical path method|critical path]] for the project.

Lead time is also the saved time by starting an activity before its predecessor is completed.

According to the PMI (2008), lead is a dependency between two activities (p.&amp;nbsp;140).&lt;ref&gt;PMI. (2008). A guide to a project management body of knowledge (4th. ed.). ''The Project Management Institute''. Newton Square, PA: PMI Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be scheduling the start of a 2-week activity dependent with the finish of the successor activity with a lead of 2 weeks so they will finish at the same time.

'''Marcel Bich''' ({{IPA-fr|bik|lang}}; Turin, 29 July 1914 – Paris, 30 May 1994) was a manufacturer and co-founder of [[BIC Corp.|Bic]], the world's leading producer of [[ballpoint pen]]s.

==Early years==
Bich was born in Turin, Italy, on July 29, 1914, to Aimé-Mario (1882–1955) and Marie Muffat de Saint-Amour de Chanaz (1886–1967). His family moved to Spain and then to France where Bich was naturalised as a French citizen in 1932&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bicworld.com/en/newsroom/news/2014-100th-anniversary-birth-marcel-bich-founder-and-president-bic-company|title=2014: 100th Anniversary of the Birth of Marcel Bich, founder and president of BIC Company|website=BICWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later studied law at the [[University of Paris]].

The Bich family originated at [[Chatillon, Aosta Valley|Châtillon]], and earlier in the [[Valtournenche]] valley, in the [[Aosta Valley]].  King [[Charles Albert of Sardinia]] created Emmanuel Bich, mayor of [[Aosta]], a baron in 1841. That man's grandson, the father of Marcel Bich, Aimé-Mario Bich, was an engineer who moved to France after failing to gain commercial success in Italy.

==Business success==
In 1945, Marcel Bich and his partner, Édouard Buffard, bought an empty factory in the [[Paris]] suburb of [[Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine|Clichy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bicworld.com/en/bic-group/history/|title=Our Heritage, Your Passion|website=BICWorld|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using Bich's knowledge of the writing instrument trade, gained while working as a production manager for an ink maker, they began production of [[fountain pen]] parts and mechanical lead pencils.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In 1953, Marcel Bich bought the [[patent]] for the ballpoint pen&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |last=Saxton |first=Wolfgang |date=June 1, 1994 | title=Marcel Bich, 79, Dies; Cheap Pens Yield Riches |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/01/obituaries/marcel-bich-79-dies-cheap-pens-yielded-riches.html |newspaper= New York Times |location= New York |access-date=25 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for US $2 million from [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[László Bíró]] who had been producing such pens since 1943 in Argentina.

The company formed by Bich still exists as the [[Société Bic]] Group and is listed on the [[Paris Stock Exchange]] and majority-owned by his family&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockvilleregister.com/company-stock-review-for-societe-bic-sa-enxtpabb/549234/|title=Rockville Register - Finance &amp; Business News|website=rockvilleregister.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yacht racing and sailing==
Bich was a keen [[sailor]]. He funded four campaigns to compete in the trials to select a challenger for the [[America's Cup]] in 1970, 1974, 1977 and 1980, and was inducted, posthumously, into the [[America's Cup Hall of Fame]] in 1998.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Personal==

Bich was one of three children, he had a sister Marie Thérèse Louise Antoinette Léandra Bich (1913–1970) and brother Albert Bich (1916–1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gw.geneanet.org/favrejhas?lang=en&amp;p=aime+mario&amp;n=bich|title=Family tree of Aimé-Mario BICH|website=Geneanet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married to Louise Chamussy in 1937. After her death in 1950 he went on to marry Jacqueline de Dufourq (1911–2007, divorced) and, in 1956, Laurence Courier de Mere (1932–).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gw.geneanet.org/favrejhas?lang=en&amp;p=marcel&amp;n=bich|title=Family tree of Marcel BICH|website=Geneanet}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had 11 children:

{{marketing}}

A '''media consultant''' is a [[marketing]] agent or [[public relations]] executive that is hired by businesses or political candidates to obtain positive press coverage.  Media consultants usually draft press releases to highlight positive achievements of a business, organization, or individual. In politics, media consultants create [[advertisement campaign]]s to plant a desired image in the minds of voters.

Top [[consulting firm]]s such as [[Bain &amp; Company|Bain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bain.com/industry-expertise/media/index.aspx|title=Media consulting / Media consultants|website=bain.com|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[McKinsey &amp; Company]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/media-and-entertainment/how-we-help-clients|title=How we help clients {{!}} Media &amp; Entertainment|website=McKinsey &amp; Company|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Boston Consulting Group]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bcg.com/en-ch/expertise/industries/media-entertainment/default.aspx|title=Media &amp; Entertainment Consulting|website=http://www.bcg.com|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; have media, technology, and entertainment practices. Media consultants at [[management consulting]] firms seek to address issues facing the industry such as strengthening [[operational efficiency]], [[brand strategy]], digital media strategies, and business technology.

It is also used to describe a person or company that enables media organizations to develop their businesses. An example where a consultant would be needed is a company that is moving its print business online.

==Social Media==

Many consultants have entered the area of [[social media]]. A social media consultant's work involves advising clients on developing [[online campaign|online media campaign]]s. These campaigns typically include the use of video, [[blog]]s, forums and other features commonly seen on social networking sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.markevanstech.com/2010/06/28/whats-a-social-media-consultant/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318202303/http://www.markevanstech.com/2010/06/28/whats-a-social-media-consultant/ |archivedate=2013-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These consultants also assist companies with managing their online presence on blogs and popular social networking sites such as [[Facebook]], [[Myspace]], [[Google+]] and [[Twitter]]. Increasingly, the more engaged companies are in social media the more valued their brands are.&lt;ref&gt;2009.

The '''middle income trap''' is a theoretical [[economic development]] situation, in which a country that attains a certain income (due to given advantages) gets stuck at that level.&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite web|author=Graphic detail Charts, maps and infographics |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/12/asias-middle-income-trap/ |title=Asias Middle Income Trap |publisher=Economist.com |date=2011-12-22 |accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dynamics ==
According to the idea, a country in the middle income trap has lost its competitive edge in the export of manufactured goods because of rising wages. However, it is unable to keep up with more developed economies in the high-value-added market. As a result, newly industrialised economies such as [[South Africa]] and [[Brazil]] have not, for decades, left what the World Bank defines as the 'middle-income range' since their per capita [[gross national product]] has remained between $1,000 to $12,000 at constant (2011) prices.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt; They suffer from low investment, slow growth in the [[secondary industry]], limited industrial diversification and poor labor market conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.org/news/op-ed/indonesia-risks-falling-middle-income-trap |title=Indonesia risks falling into the Middle Income trap |publisher=Adb.org |date=2012-03-27 |accessdate=2014-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730221825/http://www.adb.org/news/op-ed/indonesia-risks-falling-middle-income-trap |archivedate=2014-07-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Avoidance ==

Avoiding the middle income trap entails identifying strategies to introduce new processes and find new markets to maintain export growth. Ramping up domestic demand is also important—an expanding middle class can use its increasing purchasing power to buy high-quality, innovative products and help drive growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/news/speeches/seminar-asia-2050 |title=Seminar on Asia 2050 |publisher=Adb.org |date=2011-10-18 |accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest challenge is moving from resource-driven growth that is dependent on cheap labor and capital to growth based on high [[productivity]] and [[innovation]]. This requires investments in infrastructure and education—building a high-quality education system that encourages creativity and supports breakthroughs in science and technology.&lt;ref name="ADB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/publications/asia-2050-realizing-asian-century |title=Asia 2050: Realizing the Asian Century |publisher=Adb.org |date=2013-05-09 |accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mitzvah Day International''' is an annual day of faith-based social action that takes place in November each year, primarily in the [[United Kingdom]]. On Mitzvah Day each year, community groups and individuals undertake a range of [[Volunteering|volunteer]] projects for those in need in their local community. Organizations register with Mitzvah Day, which in turn helps match volunteers with local projects. The objective is to encourage people to give their time, rather than their money, to worthwhile local causes, whilst also creating deeper linkages within communities and supporting charities. In 2013, close to 30,000 people participated in Mitzvah Day around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=2013-11-19 |title=In Pictures: Mitzvah Day 2013 |url=http://jewishnews.co.uk/in-pictures-mitzvah-day-2013/ |newspaper=Hendon &amp; Finchley Times |location= |publisher=Times Series |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Though based within the [[British Jews|UK's Jewish Community]], Mitzvah Day traditionally marks the first day of UK National Inter Faith Week,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interfaithweek.org/index.php/events/events/extended-list-test?viewid=16&amp;vmode=d&amp;date=2013-11-17 |title=UK Inter Faith Week: Events for Sunday, November 17, 2013 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2013-11-17 |website=Inter Faith Week |publisher= |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result has expanded to include participants from other faith communities as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Slater |first=Anna |date=2013-11-15 |title=Interfaith Mitzvah Day project in Whetstone |url=http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/10812704.Interfaith_Mitzvah_Day_project/ |newspaper=Hendon &amp; Finchley Times |location= |publisher=Times Series |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Halkon |first=Ruth |date=2013-11-06 |title=Mitzvah Day and National Interfaith Week events in Aldenham and Radlett |url=http://www.borehamwoodtimes.co.uk/news/10790049.Gathering_together_to_make_the_community_better/ |newspaper=Borehamwood &amp; Elstree Times |location= |publisher=Times Series |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
'[[Mitzvah]]' is the Hebrew biblical term for 'deed' or '[[613 mitzvot|commandment]]', which has come to mean 'good deed' or 'charitable act' in contemporary [[English Language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mitzvah |title=Mitzvah: definition |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Miriam Webster Dictionary |publisher= |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 date is November 19.&lt;ref&gt;http://mitzvahday.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Mitzvah Day International was founded by Laura Marks in 2005, who, upon returning to her native UK from a period spent in [[Los Angeles]], decided to bring the 'Mitzvah Day' concept she became familiar with through the [[Temple Israel of Hollywood]] [[synagogue]] back to the UK. Though the Mitzvah Day she was familiar with (and most Mitzvah Days in the US) was based around a single community or [[Synagogue|congregation]], her concept for Mitzvah Day in the UK was to unite Jewish community and other groups around a single coordinated day of social action across the country. Mitzvah Day was originally associated with the [[Jewish Community Centre for London]], and became registered as an independent charity in the United Kingdom in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mitzvahday.org.uk/about-us.html |title=About Us |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Mitzvah Day |publisher= |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Endorsements ==
Mitzvah Day has been publicly endorsed by many public figures in the United Kingdom, including [[UK Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]],&lt;ref name=threeleaders&gt;{{cite news |last=Sharma |first=Suruchi |date=2011-11-11 |title=Three main party leaders back Mitzvah Day |url=http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/mitzvah/9359755.Three_main_party_leaders_back_Mitzvah_Day/ |newspaper=Hendon &amp; Finchley Times |location= |publisher=Times Series |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] and [[Leader of the Liberal Democrats|Leader]] of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] [[Nick Clegg]],&lt;ref name=threeleaders /&gt; [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[Ed Miliband]]&lt;ref name=threeleaders /&gt; Former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wolfisz |first=Francine |date=2010-11-19 |title=Tony Blair praises Mitzvah Day for "building bridges" between faiths |url=http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/mitzvah/8676992.Tony_Blair_praises_Mitzvah_Day_for__building_bridges__between_faiths/ |newspaper=Hendon &amp; Finchley Times |location= |publisher=Times Series |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blair |first=Tony |date=2010-11-18 |title=Faiths come together in joint action |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/nov/18/tony-blair-mitzvah-day |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |publisher= |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[London Mayor]] [[Boris Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=2011-11-21 |title=Boris Johnson's Mitzvah Day message |url=http://www.thejc.com/videos/news-videos/boris-johnsons-mitzvah-day-message |newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle |location=London |publisher= |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom]] [[Jonathan Sacks]], and [[The Archbishop of Canterbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Welby |first=Justin |date=2013-11-15 |title=As Archbishop of Canterbury, I'm a Mitzvah Day fan |url=http://www.thejc.com/comment-and-debate/comment/113231/as-archbishop-canterbury-im-a-mitzvah-day-fan |newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle |location=London |publisher= |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mitzvahday.org.uk/awards-and-endorsements.html |title=Awards and Endorsements |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Mitzvah Day International |publisher= |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won a Prime Minister's [[Big Society]] Award in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigsocietyawards.org/award-winners/mitzvah-day/ |title=Big Society Award Winners: 2013 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Big Society Awards |publisher= |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mitzvah-day-wins-prime-ministers-big-society-award |title=Mitzvah Day wins Prime Minister's Big Society Award |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2011-11-30 |website=Big Society Awards, Press Release |publisher=Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International expansion ==
Headquartered in [[London]], UK, the event has since spread to include participation from many international partners, primarily in [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Israel]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], and [[Southern Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mitzvahday.org.uk/around-the-world.html |title=Mitzvah Day Around The World |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2011-11-30 |website=Mitzvah Day International |publisher= |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the name of the organization officially changed from 'Mitzvah Day' to 'Mitzvah Day International' to reflect the growing participation of community groups outside the UK.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2224">'''Open Options Corporation''' is a privately owned business strategy consulting company that specializes in applied [[game theory]] and [[business war games]] where there are multiple stakeholders who can all influence the final outcome of a particular situation.

Open Options’ original software development was funded by the [[CIA]] through a company called Waterloo Engineering Software. The software was designed to help the American government better anticipate the collapse of the Soviet Union into many different breakaway republics.&lt;ref name= "Globe and Mail"&gt; https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070125.rmgame0125/BNStory/specialROBmagazine/home &lt;/ref&gt; The software was based on academic research by Dr. Niall Fraser from the [[University of Waterloo]]. Dr. Fraser has written several books on game theory including Mathematical Modeling of Resolutions of Conflict&lt;ref name= "Mathematical Modeling of Resolutions"&gt;  Okada, N, K.W. Hipel, N.M. Fraser and M. Fukushima (1988). Mathematical Modeling of Resolutions of Conflict, Kyoto Japan: Gendai Sugakusha (in Japanese).&lt;/ref&gt; and Conflict Analysis: Models and Resolutions.&lt;ref name= "Conflict Analysis"&gt;  Fraser, N.M. and K.W. Hipel (1984). Conflict Analysis: Models and Resolutions. New York: North-Holland. &lt;/ref&gt;

Open Options uses a type of game theory called Ordinal Non-cooperative Game Theory which is a less well-known sub-section of game theory.&lt;ref name = "Globe and Mail" /&gt; However, this approach and proprietary software enables Open Options to analyze millions of possible outcomes.&lt;ref name = "Globe and Mail" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Economist"&gt;http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9257879 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Risk Management Magazine"&gt; http://www.rmmag.com/MGTemplate.cfm?Section=MagArchive&amp;NavMenuID=304&amp;template=/Magazine/DisplayMagazines.cfm&amp;Archive=1&amp;IssueID=212&amp;AID=2316&amp;Volume=51&amp;ShowArticle=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "CFO magazine"&gt; http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/11700044?f=search &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter A. Wuffli''' (born 26 October 1957) is a Swiss businessman who was appointed president and chief executive officer of [[UBS|UBS AG]] in December 2001 after serving as the chef executive of UBS Asset Management and the company's chief financial officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/310/000164815/ |title= Peter Wuffli on NNDB|publisher=NNDB|accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1994 to 1998, he was the [[Chief Financial Officer]] at [[Swiss Bank Corporation|SBC]] and a member of SBC's Group Executive Board in [[Basel]]. There he met [[Marcel Ospel]], and together they rose to top positions with the new [[UBS AG]] after the 1998 merger.

In 1984, he joined [[McKinsey &amp; Co]] as management consultant and in 1990 became a partner of McKinsey Switzerland's senior management. He started his professional life, while studying at [[University of St. Gallen]], writing about economics for the [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]].

He is a Swiss citizen and a graduate of the University of St. Gallen (1981, doctorate 1984) and has also attended the Advanced Management Program at [[Wharton School]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (1989). He and his wife Susanna have three children. His hobby is opera.

His father Heinz R.

{{Political campaigning}}

'''Political consulting''' is a form of [[consulting]] that consists primarily of advising and assisting [[political campaigns]]. Although the most important role of political consultants is arguably the development and production of [[mass media]] (largely [[television]] and [[Advertising mail|direct mail]]), consultants advise campaigns on many other activities, ranging from [[opposition research]] and [[Polling place|voter polling]], to field [[strategy]] and [[get out the vote]] efforts.

==Origins==
President [[William McKinley]]'s closest political adviser [[Mark Hanna]] is sometimes described as the first political [[consultant]].

[[Whitaker and Baxter]] established the first true political consulting firm, '''Campaigns, Inc.''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Politics Became a Business|url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/24/the-lie-factory|website = The New Yorker|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; which focused exclusively on [[political campaign]]s in [[California]] in the 1930s - 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.communicationencyclopedia.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405131995_yr2011_chunk_g978140513199521_ss54-1|title=Political Consultant|publisher=International Encyclopedia of Communication|accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, political consulting blossomed with the increasing use of [[television advertising]] for '''campaign communications'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Virtuous Circle: Political Communications in Post-Industrial Societies|last = Norris|first = Pipa Norris|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 1, 2, 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.communicationencyclopedia.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405131995_yr2011_chunk_g978140513199521_ss54-1|title=Political Consultant|publisher=International Encyclopedia of Communication|accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Napolitan]] was the first person to describe himself as a political [[consultant]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Manship Guide to Political Communication|last = Perlmutter|first = David|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The New York Times]] newspaper described him in a 1968 profile as ''"that newest American phenomenon, the professional campaign manager"'' and ''a "pioneering campaign [[consultant]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Joseph Napolitan, Pioneering Campaign Consultant, Dies at 84|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/us/joseph-napolitan-pioneering-campaign-consultant-dies-at-84.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2013-12-09|access-date = 2015-12-18|issn = 0362-4331|first = Paul|last = Vitello}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, political consulting has become more commonplace throughout the world and has extended its reach to campaigns at all levels of government. Many consultants work not only for campaigns, but also for [[political party|parties]] and [[political action committee]]s, while some focus on [[public relations]] and research work.

==Nature of the work==
Political consultants sometimes act as political strategists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.collegefortn.org/Career_Planning/Career_Profile/Career_Profile.aspx?id=brKDga9mCotJfFOGYghoowXAP3DPAXXAP3DPAX|title= Political Strategist|publisher=Tennessee.Gov |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a senior political consultant who promote the [[election]] of certain [[candidate]]s or the interests of certain groups. This is achieved by planning campaign [[Strategy|strategies]], coordinating campaign staffers, and arranging events to publicize candidates or causes.

Political consultants act as [[public relations]] specialists, salespeople and managers. By using many forms of [[marketing]]-suitable media, including [[advertising]] and [[press release]]s, the general goal of political [[consultant]]s is to make voters aware of their candidates' [[party platform]].

As political consulting has expanded worldwide, [[journalist]]s have noted the influence of political consulting on candidates, voters, presidents and governments of different nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = A Brazilian Campaign Strategist Expands His Winning Streak|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/06/world/americas/a-brazilian-campaign-strategist-expands-his-winning-streak.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2013-04-05|access-date = 2015-12-18|issn = 0362-4331|first = Simon|last = Romero}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well-known [[American Association of Political Consultants|American political consultants]] such as [[James Carville]], [[Joseph Napolitan]] and David H. Sayers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = David H. Sawyer Dies at 59; Innovator in Political Strategy|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/04/obituaries/david-h-sawyer-dies-at-59-innovator-in-political-strategy.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1995-07-04|access-date = 2015-12-18|issn = 0362-4331|first = David|last = Binder}}&lt;/ref&gt; have traveled to other [[continent]]s, acting as consultants on several political campaigns and advising heads of state. For example, [[Joseph Napolitan|Napolitan]] acted as a consultant of French President [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing|Válery Giscard d’Estaing]], several [[List of Presidents of Venezuela|Venezuelan presidents]], and [[Costa Rica]]’s [[Óscar Arias Sánchez]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Joseph Napolitan {{!}} American political consultant|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Napolitan|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dick Morris]] ''"has consulted for candidates in other countries of the western hemisphere, including the campaigns of [[Fernando de la Rúa|Fernando de la Rua]] for President of Argentina, [[Jorge Batlle Ibáñez|Jorge Batlle]] for President of Uruguay, [[Vicente Fox]] for President of Mexico, and [[Raphael Trotman]] for President of Guyana."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://articles.latimes.com/1999/aug/27/news/mn-4173|title = Mexico Imports American-Style Campaigning|last = SCHRADER|first = ESTHER|date = August 27, 1999|work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Latin Americans|Latin American]] political consultants have also led [[political campaign]]s outside of their native countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ex-McCain aide outfoxes Latin America's campaign gurus in Panama race {{!}} Fox News|url = http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/05/15/ex-mccain-aide-outfoxes-latin-america-campaign-gurus-in-panama-race.html|website = Fox News|date = 2014-05-15|accessdate = 2015-12-18|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such example is Brazilian political consultant [[:pt:João Santana|João Santana]], who simultaneously led three winning presidential campaigns in [[Latin America]]: [[Danilo Medina]], in the [[Dominican Republic]]; [[Hugo Chávez]], in [[Venezuela]]; and [[José Eduardo dos Santos]], in [[Angola]], in the [[Africa|African continent.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = A Brazilian Campaign Strategist Expands His Winning Streak|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/06/world/americas/a-brazilian-campaign-strategist-expands-his-winning-streak.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2013-04-05|access-date = 2015-12-18|issn = 0362-4331|first = Simon|last = Romero}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuelan political strategist [[JJ Rendón|JJ Rendon]] (who lives in [[United States]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Venezuelan spin doctor JJ Rendon lectures the world on Neo-Totalitarianism|url = http://latincorrespondent.com/2014/10/venezuelan-spin-doctor-lectures-world-neo-totalitarianism/|website = latincorrespondent.com|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; has also been recognized internationally, having been ranked as one of the top five most prominent Latin American consultants by the U.S.-based publication ''[[Campaigns and Elections|Campaigns &amp; Elections]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.campaignsandelections.com/campaign-insider/1131/revista-politics-en-espanol|title = Revista Politics en español|last = Lieberman|first = Jordan|date = 2009|work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Latin American edition)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.noticias24.com/venezuela/noticia/120706/j-j-rendon-en-el-salon-de-la-fama-de-la-consultoria-politica/|title = El estratega político J.J.

== Criticisms ==
===Scandals===
As political consulting has become more prevalent, consultants have become subject to increasing scrutiny and involvement in [[Spotlight Scandals|spotlight scandals]] as [[journalism|journalists]] have devoted considerable attention to their activities. Some successful political consultants, such as [[James Carville]] and [[Newt Gingrich]], capitalize on their consulting fame to become professional [[pundit (politics)|pundits]]. Such political consultants routinely appear on [[television]] [[news program]]s, write books and are treated as social media [[celebrity|celebrities.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Political Consultants and Strategists - Presidential Election of 2008 - John McCain - Terry Nelson|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/weekinreview/15nagourney.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2007-07-15|access-date = 2015-12-18|issn = 0362-4331|first = Adam|last = Nagourney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some detractors accuse political consultants of putting their own interests and images ahead of their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/JSS/JSS-16-0-000-000-2008-Web/JSS-16-2-000-000-2008-Abst-Text/JSS-16-2-127-08-339-Jelili-M-O/JSS-16-2-127-08-339-Jelili-M-O-Tt.pdf|title = Audience Mindset and Influence on Personal Political Branding|last = Omojola|first = Oladokun|date = 2008|journal = Audience Mindset and Influence on Personal Political Branding|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some consultants allege that too many consultants put their own financial interests ahead of the campaigns they are hired to serve, take on too many clients, or focus too much energy on building their own reputations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = South Carolina's dirty political reputation outlives reality - CNNPolitics.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/11/politics/sc-dirty-politics/index.html|website = CNN|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social media in modern campaigns===
[[Social media]] has dramatically changed the way in which modern [[political campaign]]s are run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Political Campaigns and Social Media — Tweeting Their Way Into Office|url = http://source.southuniversity.edu/political-campaigns-and-social-media-tweeting-their-way-into-office-106986.aspx|website = source.southuniversity.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rand Paul Ready To Run As His Own Meme|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/07/rand-paul-campaign_n_7013804.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With younger and more tech-savvy citizens entering into the voting population, social media are the platforms on which the [[politician]]s need to establish themselves and engage with the public. In years to come, social media is anticipated to overtake traditional media in terms of importance to political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Social Media is Changing the Nature of Political Campaigns|url = http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/social-media-is-changing-the-nature-of-political-campaigns/619572|website = www.adweek.com|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 5 Ways New Media Are Changing Politics|url = https://www.usnews.com/opinion/slideshows/5-ways-new-media-are-changing-politics|website = US News &amp; World Report|date = 2010-02-03|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, in [[Australia]] 86% of Australians access the [[Internet]], and with a 17,048,864 voting age population (according to [http://www.idea.int/ IDEA]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Voter turnout data for Australia (Parliamentary) {{!}} Voter Turnout {{!}} International IDEA|url = http://www.idea.int/vt/countryview.cfm?CountryCode=AU|website = www.idea.int|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; around 14,662,023 voting population has access to Internet, and 65% of them use [[social media]], which means 9,530,314 Australian voters use social media (The 2013 Yellow™ Social Media Report found that among internet users 65% of Australians use social media, up from 62% last year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicalmktg.net/#!political-campaign-and-social/cjsl|title=Political Campaign and Social Media|publisher=Political Marketing|accessdate=2014-01-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116131040/http://www.politicalmktg.net/#!political-campaign-and-social/cjsl|archivedate=2014-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8724">'''Real-time business intelligence''' ('''RTBI''') is a concept describing the process of delivering [[business intelligence]] (BI) or information about business operations as they occur. [[Near real-time|Real time]] means near to zero [[latency (engineering)|latency]] and [[information access|access to information]] whenever it is required.&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1640284&amp;tag=1&lt;/ref&gt;

The speed of today's processing systems has allowed typical [[Data warehouse|data warehousing]] to work in real-time. The result is real-time business intelligence. Business transactions as they occur are fed to a real-time BI system that maintains the current state of the enterprise. The RTBI system not only supports the classic strategic functions of data warehousing for deriving information and knowledge from past enterprise activity, but it also provides real-time tactical support to drive enterprise actions that react immediately to events as they occur. As such, it replaces both the classic data warehouse and the [[enterprise application integration]] (EAI) functions. Such event-driven processing is a basic tenet of real-time business intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gravic.com/shadowbase/uses/real-timebusinessintelligencesummary.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, "real-time" means a range from [[milliseconds]] to a few seconds (5s) after the business event has occurred. While traditional BI presents historical data for manual analysis, RTBI compares current business events with historical patterns to detect problems or opportunities automatically. This automated analysis capability enables corrective actions to be initiated and/or business rules to be adjusted to optimize business processes.

RTBI is an approach in which up-to-a-minute data is analyzed, either directly from operational sources or feeding business transactions into a real time [[data warehouse]] and Business Intelligence system.

==Decision-making==
With high consumer expectations in the competitive market, decisions that are based on the most real time data available improve [[Customer Relationship Management|customer relationships]], increase [[revenue]], increased efficiency for business reporting and maximize operational [[efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gravic.com/shadowbase/pdf/white-papers/Shadowbase-for-Real-Time-Business-Intelligence.pdf|title= The Evolution of Real-Time Business Intelligence|publisher=Gravic.com | accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real-time [[business intelligence]] systems mainly provide the information necessary to tactical take advantage of events as they occur. 

At analysis level, BI systems provide consolidated information that users can detail and filter, also provides  forecasts analyses and trend analyses to develop new business insights (based on the raw data).

==Latency==
All real-time business intelligence systems have some latency,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gravic.com/shadowbase/uses/realtimebusinessintelligence.html&lt;/ref&gt; but the goal is to minimize the time from the business event happening to a corrective action or notification being initiated. Analyst Richard Hackathorn describes three types of latency:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228498840_The_BI_Watch_Real-Time_to_Real-Value|title=The BI Watch Real-Time to Real-Value|date=February 2004|author=Richard Hackathorn}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Data latency; the time taken to collect and store the data
* Analysis latency; the time taken to analyze the data and turn it into actionable information
* Action latency; the time taken to react to the information and take action

Real-time business intelligence technologies are designed to reduce all three latencies to as close to zero as possible, whereas traditional business intelligence only seeks to reduce data latency and does not address analysis latency or action latency since both are governed by manual processes.

Some commentators have introduced the concept of ''right time business intelligence'' which proposes that information should be delivered just before it is required, and not necessarily in real-time.

==Architectures==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}

===Event-based===
Real-time Business Intelligence systems are [[Event-driven architecture|event driven]], and may use [[Complex Event Processing]], [[Event Stream Processing]] and [[Mashup (web application hybrid)]] techniques to enable events to be analysed without being first transformed and stored in a database. These [[in-memory database]] techniques have the advantage that high rates of events can be monitored, and since data does not have to be written into databases data latency can be reduced to milliseconds.

===Data warehouse===
An alternative approach to event driven architectures is to increase the refresh cycle of an existing data warehouse to update the data more frequently. These real-time data warehouse systems can achieve near real-time update of data, where the data latency typically is in the range from minutes to hours. The analysis of the data is still usually manual, so the total latency is significantly different from event driven architectural approaches.

===Server-less technology===
The latest alternative innovation to "real-time" event driven and/or "real-time" data warehouse architectures is [[MSSO]] Technology (Multiple Source Simple Output) which removes the need for the data warehouse and intermediary servers altogether since it is able to access live data directly from the source (even from multiple, disparate sources).  Because live data is accessed directly by server-less means, it provides the potential for zero-latency, real-time data in the truest sense.

===Process-aware===
This is sometimes considered a subset of [[operational intelligence]] and is also identified with [[Business Activity Monitoring]]. It allows entire processes (transactions, steps) to be monitored, metrics (latency, completion/failed ratios, etc.) to be viewed, compared with warehoused historic data, and trended in real-time. Advanced implementations allow threshold detection, alerting and  providing feedback to the process execution systems themselves, thereby 'closing the loop'.

===Technologies that support real-time analytics===
Technologies that can be supported to enable real-time business intelligence are [[data visualization]], [[data federation]], enterprise information integration, enterprise application integration and [[service oriented architecture]]. [[Complex event processing]] tools can be used to analyze data streams in real time and either trigger automated actions or alert workers to patterns and trends.

;Data warehouse appliance: Data warehouse appliance is a combination of hardware and software product which was designed exclusively for analytical processing. In data warehouse implementation, tasks that involve tuning, adding or editing structure around the data, [[data migration]] from other databases, reconciliation of data are done by DBA. Another task for DBA was to make the database to perform well for large sets of users. Whereas with data warehouse appliances, it is the vendor responsibility of the physical design and tuning the software as per hardware requirements. Data warehouse appliance package comes with its own operating system, storage, DBMS, software, and required hardware. If required data warehouse appliances can be easily integrated with other tools.

;Mobile technology: There are very limited vendors for providing [[Mobile business intelligence]]; MBI is integrated with existing BI architecture. MBI is a package that uses existing BI applications so people can use on their mobile phone and make informed decision in real time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1968">'''Robert Boehringer''' (30 July 1884 in [[Winnenden]] &amp;ndash; 9 August 1974 in [[Geneva]]) was a German [[industrialist]] and [[poet]].

Boehringer was the son of a factory owner. He spent his childhood, youth, and his student years in [[Basel]], where he also had his Ph.D. approved at the local university. Until 1920 he was the head of the family firm [[Boehringer Ingelheim|C.H. Boehringer]] in [[Ingelheim]]. From 1931 he took part in the establishment of [[Hoffmann-La Roche]] in Basel. In 1930 he settled in Geneva.

After the outbreak of [[World War II]] Boehringer gave up his German citizenship and became a Swiss national. He founded the [[Commission mixte de Secours de la Croix Rouge Internationale]] and after the war he worked for [[Novartis|J. R. Geigy AG]].

From about 1905 Boehringer became a member of the circle of [[Stefan George]] and one of his most trusted friends. After George's death Boehringer became inheritor and administrator of George's estate. In 1959 he established the ''Stefan George Foundation'' and the ''Stefan George Archive''.

Works by Boehringer: „Über das Leben von Gedichten“, „Bildnisse und Nachweise“ and „Das Antlitz des Genius“.

Boehringers papers are held by the [[German Federal Archives]].

'''Robert Bonner''', [[LL.B.]] (September 10, 1920 &amp;ndash; August 12, 2005) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[lawyer]], [[politician]], and [[corporation|corporate]] executive.  He pursued his career working in the [[British Columbia]] government and in B.C.-based companies.

Bonner was born and raised in [[Vancouver]], and served with the [[Seaforth Highlanders]] in [[Italy]] in the [[Second World War]].  Upon his return to Canada, Bonner took a law degree from the [[University of British Columbia]] in 1948, and joined a practice in [[Vancouver]].  Active in politics from an early age, Bonner became a supporter and confidant of [[W.A.C. Bennett]], who would go on to lead the [[British Columbia Social Credit Party|Social Credit Party]] to victory in the [[British Columbia general election, 1952|1952 provincial election]].  To the surprise of many, Bennett appointed the unelected, 32 year-old Bonner as the province's [[Attorney General of British Columbia|Attorney General]] &amp;mdash; the youngest in B.C.'s history.  Bonner would be elected to represent the riding of [[Vancouver-Point Grey]] in the [[British Columbia general election, 1953|provincial election of 1953]], which was also the first Social Credit majority government in the province. He would retain the position of Attorney General for the next sixteen years, quickly becoming one of the most powerful ministers and closest advisors to Bennett in the Socreds' long spell of governance.

Bonner's tenure as Attorney General was marked by legal clashes with [[First Nations]] tribes over land and resource rights, especially in light of the rapid [[hydroelectric]], [[mining]], and [[forestry]] development of the province's hinterland.  Perhaps more significantly, from a historical perspective, was the provincial government's conflicts with the [[Freedomites|Sons Of Freedom]], an anti-government sect of [[Doukhobors]] resident in the [[Kootenays|Kootenay]] region of the province.  Clashes over [[public education]] led to the apprehension en masse of Freedomite children, and their confinement in government schools.

During his time in cabinet, Bonner also served at various times concurrently as Minister of Education and Minister of Trade and Commerce.  In the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia|legislature]], Bonner proved capable, serving as Bennett's [[House Leader]].  Contemporaries described him as "articulate, urbane, and always well prepared, with a demonstrated air of superiority and a ready laugh."[http://www.parl.gc.ca/Infoparl/english/issue.htm?param=104&amp;art=516]

Bonner left provincial politics in 1968 to become vice-president of [[MacMillan Bloedel]], a Vancouver-based [[logging]] and [[lumber]] company.  He would later go on to become the firm's president and [[chief executive officer]].  Bonner left Mac Blo in 1976 to become chairman of [[BC Hydro]], the provincial [[crown corporation]] responsible for producing and supplying hydroelectric power.  He retired from that position in 1985.

Bonner died in Vancouver in 2005.

'''Sir James Key Caird, 1st Baronet''' (7 January 1837 &amp;ndash; 9 March 1916) was a Scottish [[jute]] baron and [[mathematician]]. He was one of Dundee's most successful entrepreneurs, who used the latest technology in his Ashton and Craigie Mills.

Caird was noted for his interest in providing financial aid for scientific research. He was one of the sponsors of Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s ill-fated [[Antarctic]] expedition of 1914 to 1916.  The ship's boat, the ''[[Voyage of the James Caird|James Caird]]'', in which six of Shackleton's expedition made an epic voyage of 800 nautical miles (1,500&amp;nbsp;km) from [[Elephant Island]] to [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], was named in appreciation of Caird's contribution.

==Biography==
James Caird was born in [[Dundee]], and was the son of Edward Caird (1806–1889) who had founded the firm of Caird (Dundee) Ltd in 1832.&lt;ref name="Edward Caird"&gt;{{cite web |title=MS 108 Edward Caird's Trust|url=https://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%27ms%20108%27%29 |website=Archive Services Online Catalogue |publisher=University of Dundee |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business was originally based  in a 12 loom shed at Ashtown Works.&lt;ref name="Caird Ltd"&gt;{{cite web |title=MS 60 Caird (Dundee) Ltd, Jute Manufacturers |url=https://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%27ms%2060%27%29https://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%27ms%2060%27%29 |website=Archive Services Online Catalogue |publisher=University of Dundee|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elder Caird was one of the first textile manufacturers to weave cloth composed of [[jute]] warp and weft. As the use of [[jute]] became increasingly popular, the Caird business expanded and thrived.&lt;ref name="Caird Ltd"/&gt;

===Business career===
In 1870 James Caird succeeded his father as head of Caird (Dundee) Ltd. Under his leadership Ashton Works was re-built, expanded and equipped with the latest machinery. In 1905 the firm also took over Craigie Works, which had formerly supplied Caird with much of his yarn. Eventually the two works employed 2,000 hands. ''The Dundee Advertiser'' reported that Caird was a good employer who ran an efficient business which was also "a model of comfort for the workers".&lt;ref name="Caird Ltd"/&gt;

===Family===
In 1873, Caird married [[Sophy Gray (Pre-Raphaelite muse)|Sophy Gray]] (1843–82), sister-in-law of the painter [[John Everett Millais]]. Her mental health was poor and Caird appears to have been rather neglectful towards her.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Fagence Cooper (2010) ''The Model Wife: The Passionate Lives of Effie Gray, Ruskin &amp; Millais'', chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt; They had one daughter, Beatrix Ada (1874–88).&lt;ref name=Scotsman&gt;{{cite news|title=The Late Sir James K. Caird|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=11 March 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife died at the age of 38 in 1882, possibly as a result of her longstanding battle with anorexia. The couple's daughter died in 1888 at the age of 14. After the death of his closest family, Caird increasingly devoted himself to philanthropic causes.

===Philanthropy and research funding===
James Caird made a substantial fortune from his business interests and reinvested much of it in his home city. Most notably, he gave both the [[Caird Hall]], which dominates City Square, and Caird Park in the north of city to the people of Dundee which also includes mains castle also known as  finrty castle. The [[Marryat Hall]], given by his sister Mrs Emma Grace Marryat, links to Caird Hall. In total, between 1895 and 1914 James Caird gave £240,940 in donations to various good causes institutions and organisations in [[Dundee]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Caird Ltd"/&gt; In 1902 Caird offered £18,500 to the directors of the [[Dundee Royal Infirmary]] so they could erect a hospital for the treatment of cancer. He also provided £1,000 a year for five years to fund research "into the nature of this mysterious disease."  The resulting facility opened in 1906 and admitted its first patients in January 1907.&lt;ref name="Museum Services"&gt;{{cite web|title=Caird, Chemo &amp; Caring 100 Years of Cancer Research in Dundee |url=http://www.dundee.ac.uk/museum/medical/exhibitions/cancer.htm |publisher=University of Dundee |accessdate=10 June 2011 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father had earlier left a legacy to Dundee Royal Infirmary, among other good causes.&lt;ref name="MS108"&gt;{{cite web|title=MS 108/6 Discharges, receipts and related legal papers|url=https://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%27ms%20108%2F6%27%29|website=Archive Services Online Catalogue|publisher=University of Dundee|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caird was created a [[baronet]] on 8 February 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=28703 |date=21 March 1913 |page=2158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caird was noted for his interest in providing financial aid for scientific research. In 1913, he presented the [[Royal Society]] with a cheque for £5,000, which was to be used to fund physical research.&lt;ref name="Scotsman 2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gift of £5000 to the Royal Society: Sir James Caird, of Dundee, and Physical Research|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=2 December 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caird also offered [[University of Dundee|University College, Dundee]] expansive plans for a Physics laboratory, but this offer was rejected by the College Council in 1905.&lt;ref name=Lab&gt;{{cite web|title=Instrumental. An exhibition from the Physics Collection in the University Library|url=http://www.dundee.ac.uk/museum/collections/physics/instrumental.htm|publisher=University of Dundee|accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caird helped to fund Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Antarctic]] expedition of 1914 to 1916 on the [[Endurance (1912 ship)|''Endurance'']].  The largest of the ship's boats, the ''James Caird'', in which six of the ''Endurance'' crew made [[Voyage of the James Caird|their epic small-boat voyage]] of 800 nautical miles (1,500&amp;nbsp;km) from [[Elephant Island]] to [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], was named in appreciation of Caird's contribution. Caird himself died two months prior to Shackleton's arrival at Stromness, South Georgia. Thus, Caird died without ever learning of the successful rescue of the ''Endurance'' personnel whom he helped financing.

Caird was given an honorary degree from the [[University of St. Andrews]].

===Death===
Caird died at his [[Perthshire]] estate, Belmont Castle near [[Meigle]], which he had purchased after the death of its previous owner Sir [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]].&lt;ref name="Scotsman"/&gt; The baronetcy became extinct upon his death. He is buried with his father in [[Dean Cemetery]] in [[Edinburgh]] just west of the central roundel. Given his huge wealth the stone is extremely modest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10646">A '''protected slot limit''' is a tool used by [[Fishery|fisheries]] managers to regulate the size of [[fish]] that can legally be harvested from particular bodies of water.  Usually set by state fish and game departments, the protected [[Slot limits|slot limit]] prohibits the harvest of fish where the [[fish measurement|lengths, measured]] from the [[snout]] to the end of the tail, fall within the protected interval.&lt;ref&gt;Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.  “Minnesota Fishing Regulations 2011.”  2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, on a body of water where there is a protected slot limit on [[largemouth bass]] between 12 and 16&amp;nbsp;inches, largemouth between 12&amp;nbsp;inches and 16&amp;nbsp;inches may not be harvested.&lt;ref&gt;“Connecticut’s Bass Management Lakes”.  PDF. Accessed 9/25/2011.  URL:  http://www.cr.gov/dep/lib/dep/fishing/freshwater/bassbroc.pdf{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this example largemouth bass less than 12&amp;nbsp;inches and greater than 16&amp;nbsp;inches may be removed from the water and kept for personal use in accordance with local [[fishing]] regulations.

'''Slot limits''' are based on the principle that bass populations exhibit different habitat requirements during different phases of their life histories. Slot limits focus on protecting one segment of the life history which can influence overall fishing success.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsu.edu/seagrantfish/resources/factsheets/largemouthbass.htm |title=Louisiana Fisheries - Fact Sheets |publisher=Lsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[minimum landing size]] is a similar regulation in other areas.

==Purpose==
Generally, the purpose behind the implementation of protected slot limits is to improve the [[angling]] opportunities in a particular body or bodies of water.  Protected slot limits are most often used to regulate the harvest from waters where natural reproduction of the concerned fish species occurs.  The protected slot limit is set in such a way that it protects the size of those fish deemed most important to the species [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] success in that fishery.  With the size of the most sexually productive fish protected from harvest it is likely that an increased number will spawn during a given year and hence lead to more naturally produced individuals.  The effort to increase the number of fish through natural reproduction mitigates the need for artificial stocking of a species to provide for a viable recreational fishery.

In addition to improving natural reproduction success the protected slot limit can also serve to improve the average catchable size of a [[protected species]].  This is of particular concern in recreational fisheries where the practice of [[catch and release]] is not prevalent.  The slot limit protects those fish that evade harvest until their size exceeds that of the lower end of the protected slot.  They are then protected from harvest until they exceed the maximum size within the protected slot.  Fish within this size range are protected from harvest during the time when their size would make them desirable by anglers.  In such a scenario the protection of large numbers of medium-sized fish translates into a higher success rate of those that exceed the slot limit.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, Rodney.  Tomcko, Cynthia.  “Initial Effects of Slot Length Limits for Northern Pike in Five North-Central Minnesota Lakes.”  1997.  Online report.  PDF.  Accessed 9/25/2011.  URL:   http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/publications/fisheries/investigational_reports/454.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, the protected slot limit increases the amount of fish that reach the large sizes sought by [[Sport fishing|sport anglers]].  Of course, this model assumes that the lake or stream in question contains a forage base suitable to support fish of this size.

==Challenges==
The issue of protected slot limits, in some cases, is marked in controversy.  The protected slot limit and the angler’s desire to harvest fish can be in conflict.  The main challenge lies in the economic, ecological, and social factors that fisheries managers must consider when implementing harvest regulations such as protected slot limits.  Take, for example, the situation involving [[Lake Mille Lacs]] in central [[Minnesota]].  Anglers spend millions of dollars and travel countless miles to fish for Lake Mille Lacs [[walleye]] (Sander vitreus) which is highly sought after for its table fare as well as its sporting qualities.  In the case of Lake Mille Lacs there has long been a protected slot limit for walleye. In 2002, the slot limit was from 20&amp;nbsp;inches to 28&amp;nbsp;inches.  At the time, state fishing regulations stated that on Lake Mille Lacs an angler could keep 4 walleyes with only 1 walleye over 28&amp;nbsp;inches allowed, and all walleyes within the protected slot limit of 20 to 28&amp;nbsp;inches must be immediately released.  The protected slot limit worked so well, in a sense, that anglers soon found it difficult to catch harvestable sizes of walleye and they were catching an overabundance of slot-sized fish.  Many anglers have become frustrated by the lack of “eater” sized walleye. The intense protection of this size class of fish caused a sharp decline in the natural available forage base for walleyes.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, Dick.  “The Mille Lacs Fish Management Plan:  Threat to Minnesota’s Premier Walleye Fishery”.  2002.  PDF.  Accessed 9/25/2011.  URL:  http://www.perm.org/pdfs/TreatyManagement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The result was a large number of unhealthy and underweight slot sized walleyes in the fishery.  This case does represent an exception to the outcomes common to the implementation of protected slot limits.  However, it does illustrate the objectives fisheries managers must consider when devising protected slot limits.  Managers must balance the health of the fishery, trophy fish potential, and desired angler harvest.

==Ways to protect fish populations==
When an [[angling|angler]] is [[fishing]], he or she must measure the fish caught to make sure it meets the state's wildlife and fisheries requirements. Every state has their own limits for fish that are native to their ecosystems. If the fish meets the requirements then the angler is allowed to keep the fish, but can only keep a certain amount of fish of that species. Besides a slot limit there are other ways and limits that officials can use to protect a fish population.

#Minimum size limits- important when higher levels of reproduction are required.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
#Creel Limits- used to prevent the harvest of too many fish at once, allowing more fish to reach larger sizes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; [[Guist Creek Lake]] is an example of a lake that has decided that a creel limit was necessary for there native fish species.
#Closed Seasons- used to help protect fish during their [[spawning]] seasons. If a given area puts a closed season into action an angler is not allowed to fish this area during specified times of the year.

==Mode of action==
[[File:Large Mouth Bass growth.pdf|thumb|As a largemouth bass grows they must reach a certain size to enter the reproductive stage. These fish reproduce with more frequency during a certain age and weight in their lifespan.]]
[[File:Largemouth Bass Slot Limit Diagram.pdf|thumb|The desired slot limit for largemouth bass]]

Before a slot limit can be put into action, four things must be taken into consideration in order to make sure no harm is done to the ecosystem:

===Growth rate===
Growth rate can be defined as how long it takes for a fish to reach a given size. Even though growth rate differs from lake to lake, an average [[largemouth bass]] can grow up to 3 pounds in less than three years, which is considered rapid growth.&lt;ref name="bassresource1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bassresource.com/fish_biology/selective_harvest.html |title=Managing Bass Fisheries with Size Limits &amp;#124; The Ultimate Bass Fishing Resource Guide LLC |publisher=Bassresource.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recruitment===
[[Recruitment]] is defined as the number of young fish that live to adulthood. Lakes with 20 to 40% coverage of aquatic plants usually have high bass recruitment, whereas lakes with little shoreline cover often have low to intermediate recruitment.&lt;ref name="bassresource1"/&gt;
If a lake has a high recruitment, this is a good situation for a state to use the slot limit because it will help control the number of small fish in a population. When the recruitment is low, this is where a state would use the minimum-size limit to control the fish population.&lt;ref name="bassresource1"/&gt;

===Mortality===
[[Mortality rate]] is the percent of fish in a given lake that die. To find the true mortality rate of a lake, officials must divide the number of fish harvested plus fish killed from hooks, then divide that number by the number of fish that die each year.

===Finally===
After the growth rate, recruitment rate, and mortality rate have been determined, if all three factors are met, the correct measurements must be chosen to insure that no harm is done to the surrounding ecosystem. If a slot limit is used correctly, not only will the a fish population benefit from this; but the surrounding ecosystem potentially could gain some benefits from a slot limit.

==Benefits==
Slot limits can be very beneficial to fish species along with their ecosystem. One benefit from slot limits is that it reduces the amount of competitive pressure between fish the same size. Not only will it reduce competition, but it will also result in a healthier fish population since the slot limit doesn't allow anglers to keep fish that produce the most eggs during their spawning season. Since the fish are healthier and larger, this will bring more jobs and tourists to a town, which will result in the city's revenue to rise.

==Example of a slot limit==
The [[Lake Fork Reservoir]] in Texas is known for its [[largemouth bass]]. A slot limit was introduced in the early 1900s in hopes of bettering the chances of catching a trophy bass. The regulations are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richie White |url=http://www.bassfishing.org/LakeFork-BagLimits.htm |title=Lake Fork Bag Limits |publisher=Bassfishing.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Largemouth bass are subject to a 16- to 24-inch slot limit.
# Bass 16 inches and shorter and 24 inches and longer can be harvest.
# daily bag limit of 5 fish
# 1 fish can be 24 inches or greater.

{{Companies law}}

'''Sociedad anónima deportiva''' ("Public limited sports company") is a special type of [[public limited company]] in [[Spain]]. The new legal status was introduced in 1990&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csd.gob.es/csd/asociaciones/6SAD/ (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; to improve financial management and transparency in sports clubs. Many Spanish [[Association football|football]] and [[basketball]] clubs add the suffix '''S.A.D.''' to the end of their official name, e.g. [[Atlético Madrid|Club Atlético de Madrid, S.A.D.]].

Every club which plays in [[Segunda División]] or [[Liga ACB]] and remains in the league is obliged to convert to S.A.D. status.

For historical reasons, [[Athletic Bilbao|Athletic Club]], [[FC Barcelona]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]] were allowed to retain their status as non-commercial sports associations.

'''Somkid Jatusripitak''' ({{lang-th|สมคิด  จาตุศรีพิทักษ์}}, {{RTGS|Somkhit Chatusiphithak}}, {{zh|曾汉光}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2005-07-04/09066342488s.shtml 他信赴潮寻根颂奇回汕祭祖] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529173119/http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2005-07-04/09066342488s.shtml |date=May 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; born 15 July 1953) is a Thai economist, business theorist, and politician.

A mentee of [[Philip Kotler]], he has (co-)authored books on competitiveness and taught marketing at Thai universities. He was a co-founder and leader of the [[Thai Rak Thai Party]] (TRT) and was mainly responsible for developing the party's progressive and reformist economic and social platform. After the party's electoral victory, he served as Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, and Minister of Commerce in [[Thaksin Shinawatra]]'s government. Following the [[2006 Thai coup d'état|coup d'état in 2006]], the junta chose him as an economic envoy, advocating the royally-endorsed "[[self-sufficiency]]" economic agenda.

After another [[2014 Thai coup d'état|military coup in 2014]], he served as the junta's advisor on foreign economic relations. Since September 2014 he has been a full member of the so-called [[National Council for Peace and Order]].

==Early life==
Somkid was born in Bangkok and grew up in a large, but modest [[Thai Chinese]] ([[Teochew people|Teochew]]) family, one of 10 children.&lt;ref name="Somkid promises he'll do it his way"&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/thanong/02152001.htm Somkid promises he'll do it his way&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://216.109.125.130/search/cache?p=Somkid+Jatusripitak+chinese&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fp_ip=SG&amp;meta=0&amp;fl=0&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;u=yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article%3Fid%3D2875&amp;w=somkid+jatusripitak+chinese&amp;d=bqXAKPmdOiG3&amp;icp=1&amp;.intl=us YaleGlobal]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His great-great grandfather immigrated from [[China]] during the reign of the [[Jiaqing Emperor]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sina.com.cn/s/2005-07-03/12106336925s.shtml 泰国副总理颂奇回汕省亲祭祖 林木声黄志光等前往机场迎接] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184053/http://news.sina.com.cn/s/2005-07-03/12106336925s.shtml |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (early 19th century). Despite being born and raised in Thailand, Somkid still speaks Thai with a strong Chinese accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Pasuk Phongpaichit |authorlink1=Pasuk Phongpaichit |author2=Chris Baker |authorlink2=Chris Baker (writer) |title=Thaksin: The Business of Politics in Thailand |publisher=NIAS Press |place=Copenhagen |year=2004|pages=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author="[[Chang Noi]]" |title=The culture of PM Thaksin |newspaper=The Nation |date=3 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his older brothers, [[Som Jatusripitak]] later became president of Siam City Bank and Commerce Minister in [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]]'s government.&lt;ref name="thanong.tripod.com"&gt;[http://thanong.tripod.com/05182000.htm 05182000&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212320/http://thanong.tripod.com/05182000.htm |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife, Anurachanee Jatusripitak, teaches at [[Chulalongkorn University]]. They have three children.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Education and academic career==
Somkid went to Triam Udom Suksa School and graduated with a bachelor's degree from the Faculty of Economics, [[Thammasat University]] in 1972. Later, he completed an MBA in Finance from the Graduate School of Business Administration (NIDA Business School), [[National Institute of Development Administration]] (NIDA) and a Ph.D. in marketing from the [[Kellogg School of Management]] at [[Northwestern University]].

After graduating, he joined a teaching position and became Associate Professor in Marketing at the Graduate School of Business Administration (NIDA Business School). He also served as an Associate Dean at NIDA Business School. Somkid's thinking was greatly influenced by [[Michael Porter]]'s "Competitiveness of Nations". He focused much of his academic research on the development of national and business competitiveness. Along with his mentor [[Philip Kotler]], he was a strong supporter of the concept of [[Nation Branding]]. In 1997, Somkid co-authored "The Marketing of Nations: A Strategic Approach to Building National Wealth" with [[Philip Kotler]]. The book outlined how countries could improve their competitiveness through marketing and appropriate policies to support it.&lt;ref name="Somkid promises he'll do it his way"/&gt; Somkid's book, ''Borisat Prathet Thai'' ("Thailand Inc: Concepts and Strategy"), stressed how Thailand should use marketing to improve its competitiveness.

==Business career==
Somkid was a co-founder of the Manager Media Group, along with [[Sondhi Limthongkul]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=6&amp;id=58371 Bangkok's Independent Newspaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312004752/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=6&amp;id=58371 |date=March 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He played a role in the establishment of the Phatra Research Institute.&lt;ref name="Somkid promises he'll do it his way"/&gt;  He became a Director of the Saha Pattanapibul Group, a major Thai consumer goods conglomerate.  He was appointed to become Advisor of the [[Stock Exchange of Thailand]], Director of PTTEP, and Director of the [[PTT Public Company Limited|Petroleum Authority of Thailand]].

==Political career==

===Advisor to Foreign Minister Thaksin Shinawatra===
Somkid became secretary to Foreign Minister Thaksin Shinawatra under [[Banharn Silpa-Archa]]'s government (1995–96).

===Advisor to Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya===
Somkid became secretary to Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya under [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]]'s government (1996–97).

===Founding of the Thai Rak Thai Party===
Somkid was one of the co-founders of the Thai Rak Thai party in 1998, along with party leader Thaksin Shinawatra.  His senior stature in the party was apparent from his no. 3 position in the TRT's 2001 election party list, behind Thaksin Shinawatra and Purachai Piemsomboon.

Somkid has been called "the man behind ''Thaksinomics''",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epw.org.in/showArticles.php?root=2005&amp;leaf=07&amp;filename=8901&amp;filetype=html]{{dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the mastermind of the populist policies that helped propel the Thai Rak Thai party to a landslide election victory in 2001. The TRT "won by embracing
populism on a grand scale," said the Far Eastern Economic Review. Somkid's chief policy innovations included the universal healthcare program, 1 million THB development funds for each of Thailand's 70,000 villages, a 3-year loan freeze for farmers, fast-track privatization of state enterprises, and a national asset management corporation (AMC) to buy up the $20 billion in bad debt carried by Thai banks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pathfinder.com/asiaweek/magazine/nations/0,8782,100225,00.html Asiaweek.com | On The Hot Seat | 2/3/2001&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221125834/http://www.pathfinder.com/asiaweek/magazine/nations/0,8782,100225,00.html |date=December 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=[[Duncan McCargo]] |author2=Ukrist Pathmanand |title=The Thaksinization of Thailand |place=Copenhagen |publisher=NIAS Press |year=2005 |pages=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somkid also pioneered the TRT party's rural small and medium enterprise (SME) policy. Noting that agriculture remains the most important economic sector, employing 60-70% of the Thai population, the economic challenge was to develop the agricultural sector and link it with the modern sector.&lt;ref name="thanong.tripod.com"/&gt;  This became one of the founding principles of the Thaksin government's popular [[One Tambon One Product]] (OTOP) program.

At the time, ''The Nation'' newspaper exclaimed that these policies "amount to a revolution in Thai public policy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://thanong.tripod.com/01112001.htm Somkid - who else could it be?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061420/http://thanong.tripod.com/01112001.htm |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minister in Thaksin's government===
From the TRT's landslide election win of 2001, Somkid was a core member of Thakin's economic inner cabinet - starting off as Finance Minister and then becoming Commerce Minister.

====Finance Minister====

*In 2002, Somkid established the ''village fund program''. This program gave each of Thailand's 70,000 villages a self-managed fund of 1 million THB (approx. 25,000 USD), to be used for grassroots social and economic investments.

====Commerce Minister====
{{prose|section|date=May 2014}}
In his term as Commerce Minister (August 2005 to September 2006), Somkid
* oversaw the recovery of tourism industry in the Andaman coast after the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|tsunami of 2004]]
* agreed to draw up a comprehensive road map for increasing trade, investment and cooperation with the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/09/pda/business_30006098.html Bangkok's Independent Newspaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303203830/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/09/pda/business_30006098.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* boosted Board of Investment incentives in three target sectors - electronics, petrochemicals and vehicle tyres&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/23/business/business_30004653.php BoI okays additional incentives for investors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170953/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/23/business/business_30004653.php |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2005–06 Thai political crisis|anti-Thaksin demonstrations of 2005-2006]], Thaksin noted that Somkid was one of four individuals who might succeed him as Prime Minister if he stepped down.

In March 2006, during the height of the anti-Thaksin protests, Somkid underwent [[balloon angioplasty]] surgery to relieve a blood clot in an artery near his heart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manager.co.th/IHT/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9490000039755 IHT ThaiDay - Manager Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165315/http://www.manager.co.th/IHT/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9490000039755 |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Thaksin Shinawatra]]'s announcement that he would not accept the Premiership from Parliament after the April 2006 elections, Somkid was widely seen as a potential replacement. In a poll of businessmen, 57% said Somkid was the most suitable candidate for new premier. The next highest TRT politician was Bhokin Bhalakula, who received only 12%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/07/politics/politics_30001181.php Businessmen put Somkid in box seat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202734/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/07/politics/politics_30001181.php |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon later, a broad coalition of TRT factions, including Wang Nam Yom (130 MPs), Rim Nam (15 MPs), Lamtakong (7 MPs), Wang Phya Nag (10 MPs), Chon Buri (7 MPs) and the Central provinces (10 MPs) decided to push for Somkid Jatusripitak as the next prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/07/headlines/headlines_30001187.php Somkid takes an early lead in race to become prime minister&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214239/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/07/headlines/headlines_30001187.php |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath of the 2006 coup===
The Thai military staged a successful [[2006 Thailand coup|coup]] against the Thaksin government on 19 September 2006.  At the time, Somkid was in [[Paris]], attending the Thai-France Cultural Exhibition with Princess [[Sirindhorn]] and Foreign Minister [[Kantathi Supamongkhon]]. On 21 September 2006 arrived back to Bangkok.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation. {{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid%3D30014251 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224235209/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30014251 |archivedate=2007-12-24 |df= }}, Somkid arrives at Don Muang&lt;/ref&gt;   Unlike several other senior members of Thaksin's Cabinet, he was not arrested by the [[CDRM|junta]].  Somkid kept a low profile, until on 2 October 2006 he resigned from the  Thai Rak Thai Party, along with Thaksin Shinawatra.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, Oct. 2, 2006 [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/03/headlines/headlines_30015263.php Thaksin resigns from Thai Rak Thai] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303183911/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/03/headlines/headlines_30015263.php |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, Oct. 2, 2006 [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015265 Somkid resigns from Thai Rak Thai Party] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012000000/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015265 |date=October 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued to lead a low profile, until in February 2007, he was appointed head of a government committee charged with "preaching" King [[Bhumibol]]'s [[self-sufficient economy]] policy. The appointment provoked great controversy, as critics claimed that the populist economics czar had no role promoting self-sufficiency.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/02/18/national/national_30027159.php More flak over role for Somkid] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195305/http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/02/18/national/national_30027159.php |date=March 3, 2016 }}, 18 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30027069 Banharn criticises Surayud for appointing Somkid as economic envoy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207095348/http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30027069 |date=December 7, 2008 }}, 18 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Somkid appointment was supported by General [[Saprang Kalyanamitr]], a powerful member of the junta, and [[Sondhi Limthongkul]] of the [[People's Alliance for Democracy]], a long-time colleague of Somkid's. Somkid later decided to resign from the committee, which was then dissolved. Somkid's long-time rival, Finance Minister [[Pridiyathorn Devakula]] volunteered to help perform the committee's role, and denied any role in Somkid's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://pages.citebite.com/o1b1p3x7t7sax Pridiyathorn: No need to replace Somkid] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230845/http://pages.citebite.com/o1b1p3x7t7sax |date=March 3, 2016 }}, 21 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In early May 2007, a group of former elected senators said they were ready to support Somkid in forming a new political party, the so-called Dharma Thippatai group. Among those included Suraporn Danaitangtrakoon, Anek Laothamatas (former leader of the [[Mahachon Party]]), and former Thai Rak Thai members [[Suranand Vejjajiva]] and [[Pimol Srivikorn]].&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/05/10/politics/politics_30033826.php Former senators-elect back Somkid] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314112113/http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/05/10/politics/politics_30033826.php |date=March 14, 2012 }}, 10 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 June 2007, they founded [[Ruam Jai Thai]]. However, on 30 May 2007 the Constitutional Tribunal had produced a [[2006 Thai political party dissolution charges|verdict]], barring all 111 former executive members of Thai Rak Thai Party, including Somkid, from holding political office for five years.&lt;ref name="TFSI"&gt;{{Cite news |author=Jon Fernquest |title=Institute, not politics, now Somkid's focus |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/learning/learning-from-news/305036/somkid-jatusripitak-research-institute-not-politics |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Somkid founded the ''Thailand Future Study Institute'', a [[think tank]] which is sponsored by major Thai business corporations and seeks to provide research and consulting to public bodies and private sector.&lt;ref name="TFSI"/&gt;

After the [[2014 Thai coup d'état|22 May 2014 coup d'état]], the junta—which calls itself [[National Council for Peace and Order]] (NCPO)—appointed Somkid member of its "advisory board" in charge of foreign economic relations, especially with Asian countries China and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Prawit, Somkid, Pridiyathorn named advisers |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=27 May 2014 |url=http://bangkokpost.com/news/local/412074/prawit-somkid-pridiyathorn-named-advisers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/412579/ncpo-lays-out-stages-to-next-poll |title=NCPO lays out stages to next poll |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 September Somkid—as one of two civilians— was appointed as a member of the NCPO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/432553/somkid-meechai-sit-on-ncpo |title=Somkid, Meechai sit on NCPO |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4891">'''Surface integrity''' is the surface condition of a workpiece after being modified by a [[manufacturing]] process. The term was coined by Michael Field&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Dr. Michael Field | url = http://www.nae.edu/nae/naepub.nsf/Members+By+UNID/AA719535BA65B8E186257552006B36A1?opendocument | accessdate = 2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and John F. Kahles&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Field | title = John F. Kahles | url = http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=4779&amp;page=121 | accessdate = 2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1964.&lt;ref name="degarmo778"&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=778}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface integrity of a workpiece or item changes the material's properties. The consequences of changes to surface integrity are a [[mechanical engineering]] design problem, but the preservation of those properties are a manufacturing consideration.&lt;ref name="degarmo779"/&gt;

Surface integrity can have a great impact on a parts function; for example, [[Inconel]] 718 can have a [[fatigue limit]] as high as {{convert|540|MPa|abbr=on}} after a gentle [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] or as low as {{convert|150|MPa|abbr=on}} after [[electrical discharge machining]] (EDM).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=777}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
There are two aspects to surface integrity: ''topography characteristics'' and ''surface layer characteristics''. The topography is made up of [[surface roughness]], [[waviness]], errors of form, and flaws. The surface layer characteristics that can change through processing are: [[plastic deformation]], [[residual stress]]es, cracks, [[hardness]], overaging, [[phase changes]], [[recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallization]], intergranular attack, and [[hydrogen embrittlement]]. When a traditional manufacturing process is used, such as [[machining]], the surface layer sustains local plastic deformation.&lt;ref name="degarmo778"/&gt;&lt;ref name="degarmo779"&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=779}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The processes that affect surface integrity can be conveniently broken up into three classes: ''traditional processes'', ''non-traditional processes'', and ''finishing treatments''. Traditional processes are defined as processes where the tool contacts the workpiece surface; for example: [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]], [[turning]], and machining. These processes will only damage the surface integrity if the improper parameters are used, such as dull tools, too high feed speeds, improper coolant or lubrication, or incorrect grinding wheel hardness. Nontraditional processes are defined as processes where the tool does not contact the workpiece; examples of this type of process include EDM, [[electrochemical machining]], and [[Industrial etching|chemical milling]]. These processes will produce different surface integrity depending on how the processes are controlled; for instance, they can leave a stress-free surface, a remelted surface, or excessive surface roughness. Finishing treatments are defined as processes that negate surface finishes imparted by traditional and non-traditional processes or improve the surface integrity. For example, compressive residual stress can be enhanced via [[peening]] or [[roller burnishing]] or the recast layer left by EDMing can be removed via chemical milling.&lt;ref name="degarmo780"&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=780}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finishing treatments can affect the workpiece surface in a wide variety of manners. Some clean and/or remove defects, such as scratches, pores, [[burr (metal)|burr]]s, [[flash (manufacturing)|flash]], or blemishes. Other processes improve or modify the surface appearance by improving smoothness, texture, or color. They can also improve [[corrosion resistance]], [[wear]] resistance, and/or reduce [[friction]]. [[Coating]]s are another type of finishing treatment that may be used to [[plating|plate]] an expensive or scarce material onto a less expensive base material.&lt;ref name="degarmo780"/&gt;

==Variables==
Manufacturing processes have five main variables: the workpiece, the [[tool]], the [[machine tool]], the environment, and process variables. All of these variables can affect the surface integrity of the workpiece by producing:&lt;ref name="degarmo778"/&gt;

*High temperatures involved in various machining processes
*Plastic deformation in the workpiece (residual stresses)
*Surface geometry (roughness, cracks, distortion)
*[[Chemical reaction]]s, especially between the tool and the workpiece

In 1987, after [[Head Wrightson]]s' Teesdale Works closed and the site had been cleared, Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] visited the site as part of her visit to [[Teesside]] to open the [[Teesside Development Corporation]] and made what has been poignantly termed her "Walk in the Wilderness".&lt;ref name="WitW"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hewison |first=Fergus |title=The Thatcher confrontation... |work=[[Politics Show]] |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=3 February 2011 |date=13 September 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/politics_show/6993640.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=She brought us back from the dead |newspaper=[[The Northern Echo]] |accessdate=3 February 2011 |date=17 May 2004 |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/archive/2004/05/17/The+North+East+Archive/6990845._She_brought_us_back_from_the_dead_/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005033222/http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/archive/2004/05/17/The+North+East+Archive/6990845._She_brought_us_back_from_the_dead_/ |archivedate=5 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Norfolk |first=Andrew |title=Posterity proves a kinder judge of 'wilderness walk' |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/posterity-proves-a-kinder-judge-of-wilderness-walk-j87gs89t7m6 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |accessdate=10 March 2017 |date=12 April 2013 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The One Club was founded in 1961 as the Advertising Writers Association of New York. In 1969, it became The Copy Club and in 1979, the name changed for the last time to The One Club. In 1973, The One Show was created. It was a joint venture with The Copy Club and [[Art Directors Club of New York|The Art Directors Club]]. In 1977, The Copy Club began producing The One Show independently.

==Competitions==
The One Show international jury of [[art directors]], [[copywriters]] and [[creative directors]] considers more than 18,000 entries from nearly 60 countries, selecting 500 finalists. One Show Design awards excellence in design in advertising, branding, and other forms of visual communication in a dedicated ceremony. In 1998, The One Club launched One Show Interactive, the first award show dedicated exclusively to advertising in new media. With the One Show Interactive awards, The One Club extended its mission of recognizing creative excellence to the new media field. 2008 was the initial year for One Show Entertainment Awards, honoring outstanding creative achievements by brands in entertainment. Held annually in Los Angeles. OneScreen is the original film festival for the creative community by the creative community. It is more than just a night of commercials. It is an extension of the One Club's mission to elevate the creative standards in advertising and design in all its forms. OneScreen gives industry professionals a venue to showcase independently produced film and video work made for any platform, thereby attracting some of the most innovative and visually arresting work. Based on its primary mission to support the next generation of advertising and design creatives, The One Club’s Education Department offers several programs throughout the year.

'''''Victoria II''''' is a [[grand strategy game]] developed by [[Paradox Development Studio]] and published by [[Paradox Interactive]]. It was announced on August 19, 2009, and released on August 13, 2010.&lt;ref name="ignsum" /&gt;

[[Virtual Programming]] published the Mac OS X version of the game on September 17, 2010.&lt;ref name=VP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macgamer.com/news/victoria-ii-released |title=Victoria 2 Released |date=September 17, 2010 |publisher=[[MacGamer]] |accessdate=2010-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714014539/http://www.macgamer.com/news/victoria-ii-released |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The game was localized for Russia by [[1C Company]] and Snowball Studios.&lt;ref name="snowball"/&gt;

Like its [[Victoria:_An_Empire_Under_the_Sun|predecessor]], ''Victoria II'' allows for the player to take control of and manage a [[19th century|19th-century]] state, including its political, diplomatic, economic, military, and technological aspects. The game has many historical aspects to it, such as the ability to [[Colonization|colonize]] places that, at the time, were not under the control of any European power, such as [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and [[Western Canada|North-Western Canada]]. The time frame of the game is 1836-1936.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Victoria2Screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A preview image of ''Victoria II'' showing the political map mode, interfaces, in Northern Italy in 1836.|A preview image of ''Victoria II'' showing the political map mode, interfaces, and Northern Italy in 1836.]] ''Victoria II'' spans the globe from 1836 to the start of 1936 with over 200 playable nations.&lt;ref name="announcement"&gt;[http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=423311 Victoria II Announcement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823161918/http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=423311 |date=2009-08-23 }}, Paradox Plaza&lt;/ref&gt; Like its predecessor, ''Victoria II'' focuses on internal management, covering the [[industrialization]] and social/political changes in a country with 8 different government types. The game gives a lot of importance to the economy of a country by having a complex [[market system]] with over 50 types of goods and [[factories]].&lt;ref name="announcement" /&gt; While warfare is a component of the game it is not the primary focus as in other Paradox Interactive games such as the [[Hearts of Iron]] series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=445988  Developer Diary 3 – Design Philosophy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126053851/http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=445988 |date=2010-01-26 }}, Paradox Plaza&lt;/ref&gt;

Nations' populations are divided into [[cultures]], [[religions]], and [[Employment|occupations]]. There are several different population groups or "pops" including aristocrats, officers, clergy, capitalists, clerks, craftsmen, soldiers, laborers, and farmers. ''Victoria II'' introduces two new groups, [[artisan]]s and bureaucrats. As in other Paradox titles, like [[Europa Universalis]], historical missions called "decisions" that are micro-objectives in the larger game have been added. There are thousands of historical events and decisions as well.&lt;ref name="announcement" /&gt; These events and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] forces can lead to the creation or disintegration of nation states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=451973  A Paradox Christmas Carol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201192103/http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=451973 |date=2010-02-01 }}, Paradox Plaza&lt;/ref&gt;

''Victoria II'' contains a number of changes and improvements from its predecessor. The interface was streamlined when compared to the original game, which was described by producer [[Johan Andersson (game programmer)|Johan Andersson]] as, "the interface God forgot".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud79BkQ4vOI Victoria II interview], Youtube&lt;/ref&gt; Automation of various tasks has been added, including trade and population promotion. The [[Education|education system]] has received an overhaul by having clergy educate people of the same religion, and each population group now has their own [[literacy]] levels. Education and literacy's importance is reflected in the vast technology system that contains thousands of inventions.&lt;ref name="announcement" /&gt; Additionally, the functioning of ideology in the game was tweaked such that population groups are more sensitive to changes in their country's situation, as well as inclined to agitate for specific levels of political and social reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=460203  Developer Diary 11 - PoPs &amp; Issues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215080451/http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=460203 |date=2010-02-15 }}, Paradox Plaza&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economy ===
The economic system in ''Victoria II'' attempts to simulate the flow of resources in a world market. Every province in the game produces a resource in resource gathering operations (RGOs).&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=447243 Dev Diary 4 - The Economic System and why it may seem a little similar], Paradox Plaza&lt;/ref&gt; Some resources, such as [[wheat]], are demanded principally by the population. Other materials, like [[iron]], are consumed primarily by industry, but are still tradeable.

The production and [[unemployment]] system from the original Victoria has been revised to better reflect market forces, whereas in the original the state provided the funds for resources and the player possessed a wide range of options with which to build their economy, provided they had access to the proper raw materials. All resources can be collected or produced by industry. The game also has a cottage production system simulating [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial economies]].&lt;ref name="announcement" /&gt;

=== Diplomacy ===
''Victoria II'' contains a deep [[political simulation]] reflected in 8 different types of governments, 7 ideologies and a new [[sphere of influence]] system, [[gunboat diplomacy]], and a new election system with [[Coalition government|coalition governments]] and legislatures.&lt;ref name="announcement" /&gt;

The diplomacy in ''Victoria II'' is similar to that of other Paradox titles. Each country has a relation value of –200 to +200 which represents how much they like each other. Diplomatic and in game actions shift this relationship around and it factors into the AI's decisions. However, Paradox Interactive has expanded parts of this system. War goals from [[Europa Universalis III|Heir to the Throne]], an expansion for [[Europa Universalis III]] have been integrated though they function in a slightly different way. More war goals can be added as the war progresses, although this does affect the population's temperament. Failure to achieve a war goal will increase the population's militancy, which can lead to revolts.

In the game controlling a [[Great Power]], one of the eight countries with highest total score, gives special diplomatic options not available to other countries. Great Powers do not just influence how a country sees them; they have the added ability to use their influence on other countries to change their perception of other Great Powers. The struggle for influence that the Great Powers wage around the world is not a simple bilateral basis but occurs with each other inside different countries, giving an added dimension to diplomacy which was not present in the original Victoria.

=== Warfare ===
Warfare is regarded as a lesser priority than politics and economics in ''Victoria II'', though it follows the basic pattern used in other Paradox grand strategy games, with armies moving between provinces and engaging enemy armies and capturing enemy territory.  The basic combat system is a combination of the systems used in [[Europa Universalis III]], [[Europa Universalis: Rome]], and [[Hearts of Iron III]].  A key component to combat is "frontage": the number of units in an army at the [[front line]], which decreases as technology improves to simulate the change from the roving armies of the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic Era]] to the continuous trench lines of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="warfare"&gt;[http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?p=10788944#post10788944 Developer Diary 12 - Military], Paradox Plaza&lt;/ref&gt;

Several aspects of the military have been changed from ''Victoria''.  The base unit has been reduced from a 10,000-unit [[Division (military)|division]] to a 3,000-unit [[brigade]], which is no longer raised from a national manpower pool but directly raised from a provincial soldier POP, to which the brigade remains connected.  A new aspect to the military is [[reconnaissance]].  This is a value that gives a bonus (or penalty, if low) to capturing provinces and defeating enemy armies; in prolonged combat, however, the reconnaissance value drops.  Units such as cavalry and aeroplanes have high reconnaissance values and are intended to be used as scouts.&lt;ref name="warfare" /&gt;

== Development ==
The decision to create ''Victoria II'' was influenced by voting on the Paradox Interactive forums and debate within the company. The CEO of Paradox Interactive, [[Fredrik Wester]], publicly announced his belief that the game would never see a profit while other members of the company such as [[Johan Andersson (game programmer)|Johan Andersson]] were confident it would be profitable. To this end Wester promised that if the game did indeed make a profit he would shave his head and post the pictures onto the forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=424492 A small note from a guy who didn't vote for this project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826194645/http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=424492 |date=2009-08-26 }}, Paradox Plaza&lt;/ref&gt; This belief stemmed from [[Victoria: An Empire Under the Sun|the first game's]] lackluster sales numbers.  It was revealed in a German interview with Fredrik that 70,000 copies would need to be sold in order for Victoria II to be profitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.makinggames.biz/features/im-gespr%C3%A4ch-mit-paradox-interactive,2540.html Im Gespräch mit Paradox Interactive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008173454/http://www.makinggames.biz/features/im-gespr%C3%A4ch-mit-paradox-interactive,2540.html |date=2014-10-08 }}, Making Games&lt;/ref&gt; On June 17, 2010, [[Jessica Chobot]] from [[IGN]] shaved it off for him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://twitpic.com/1xma93 Jessica Chobot shaving Frederik's head] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621220205/http://twitpic.com/1xma93 |date=2010-06-21 }}, [[Twitpic]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansions and mods==
''Victoria II'' has received two main expansion packs, as well as numerous other smaller additions. It was released before Paradox's current DLC plan was used, so differs from games such as ''Europa Universalis IV'' and ''Crusader Kings II'' in regards to this.

Many players consider the expansions to be essential to gaining full enjoyment from the game, going as far as to dismiss ''Victoria II'' without expansions as unplayable; having added not only new content and mechanics, but also significant user experience improvements like the ability to queue unit production, move/select units, and transport these over water (a common complaint addressed in early releases of Paradox titles such as CK2 and EU4 which Paradox has subsequently patched).{{Citation Needed|date=April 2018}}

Victoria II received generally favourable reviews, achieving a 75% average on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=MC&gt;{{cite web|title=Victoria II for PC Reviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/victoria-ii|work=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|accessdate=23 May 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/656PCxHrd?url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/victoria-ii|archivedate=31 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GameSpot]] said that there was much less [[Micromanagement (gameplay)|micromanagement]] than in its predecessor. The reviewer stated: "Thanks to a friendlier interface and tutorials, Victoria II is a lot more playable and enjoyable than its predecessor."&lt;ref name=GameSpot&gt;[http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/victoriaii/review.html Gamespot] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906112943/http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/victoriaii/review.html |date=September 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GameShark]] was less enthusiastic. The reviewer said: "As a strategy game, Victoria II frustrates me. It is an orgy of detail for detail's sake, yet the information I really want never seems to be at hand. The decisions I make seem mostly inconsequential, changing the game only by a slow process of accretion. Modeling has overtaken game design. Watching Victoria II is hypnotic and frequently awe-inspiring. Unfortunately, you only occasionally might want to play it."&lt;ref name=GShark&gt;[http://www.gameshark.com/reviews/3602/p_20/Victoria-II-Review-.htm GameShark] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828122647/http://www.gameshark.com/reviews/3602/p_20/Victoria-II-Review-.htm |date=August 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of A House Divided drew increased praise and averaged 76% on Metacritic,&lt;ref name=MCHouse&gt;{{cite web|title=Victoria II: A House Divided|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/victoria-ii-a-house-divided|work=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|accessdate=1 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151112121808/http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/victoria-ii-a-house-divided|archivedate=12 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Heart of Darkness further increased positive reviews, averaging 81%.&lt;ref name=MCHeart&gt;{{cite web|title=Victoria II: Heart of Darkness|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/victoria-ii-heart-of-darkness|work=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|accessdate=1 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823051012/http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/victoria-ii-heart-of-darkness|archivedate=23 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaming Nexus gave the final product a verdict of 8.5 ("very good") and commented that "after some patching and a couple of expansions, Victoria 2 is rounding into shape. It is still deep with a killer learning curve, but it is starting to feel like a fun game rather than a buggy spreadsheet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bitterman|first1=Tom|title=Victoria II Heart of Darkness|url=http://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/Victoria-II-Heart-of-Darkness/Item3964.aspx|website=Gaming Nexus|accessdate=1 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924020725/http://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/Victoria-II-Heart-of-Darkness/Item3964.aspx|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sequel ==

In an Ask Me Anything thread on [[reddit]] in October 2013, PDS manager Johan Andersson stated that they would consider making a sequel to ''Victoria II'', but that this would likely come after ''[[Hearts of Iron IV]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1p272v/we_are_the_independent_publisher_developer/ccyid2x|title=AMA Hearts of Iron 4|date=23 October 2013|accessdate=2013-10-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401160155/http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1p272v/we_are_the_independent_publisher_developer/ccyid2x|archivedate=1 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, a beta patch was made for ''Victoria II'', long after it was assumed that no further patches would be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victoria 2 - 3.04 BETA PATCH - Merry Christmas!|url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/victoria-2-3-04-beta-patch-merry-christmas.898844/|website=Paradox Plaza|accessdate=28 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403043640/https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads%2Fvictoria-2-3-04-beta-patch-merry-christmas.898844%2F|archivedate=3 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted speculation that there could be refreshed interest in the ''Victoria'' series, although in a Reddit thread these rumours were played down by Paradox developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victoria 2 - 3.04 BETA PATCH|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/3xuebw/victoria_2_304_beta_patch/?|website=Reddit|accessdate=28 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129012724/https://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/3xuebw/victoria_2_304_beta_patch/|archivedate=29 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview for the company’s Paradox Podcast on February 2018, CEO Fredrik Wester mentioned "I'm not a firm believer that Victoria II is the most prioritised game to make a sequel out of", that he won't be the one making the decision either and that it would come "before 2025".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Paradox Podcast S02E02 - The Ascension of Fred (with Guest: Fred Wester) |url=https://www.buzzsprout.com/164561/665610 |website=buzzsprout |publisher=Paradox Interactive |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Yasukichi Murakami'''|村上 安吉|Murakami Yasukichi|extra=19 December 1880 – 26 June 1944}} was a businessman and inventor.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Murakami was born in 1880 in [[Kushimoto, Wakayama|Tanami]], [[Wakayama Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. The area at the time was impoverished so his parents sent him with a relative in 1897 to [[Western Australia]] where they believed he would make his fortune in gold. He arrived at [[Cossack, Western Australia|Cossack]] on the ''Saladin''.&lt;ref name="adb1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150514b.htm|title=Murakami, Yasukichi (1880 - 1944) |work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=18 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whitedivers1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bailey|first=John|title=The White Divers of Broome: The True Story of a Fatal Experiment|publisher=Pan Macmillan Australia|year=2002|pages=148–152|chapter=The Deep|isbn=0-330-36338-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Australia===
On arriving in Western Australia Murakami worked on a number of jobs before securing work in a [[general store]] owned by fellow Japanese immigrant Takazò Nishioka. In 1900 he and Nishioka moved to [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]] where they remained in business together. When Nishioka died in 1901 his business transferred to his widow Eki. In 1906 Murakami married Eki, who was much older than Murakami. The business grew in size under the direction of the husband and wife team with the retail operations being supplemented by an import and export business as well as the institution of an unofficial banking operation for the local Japanese community.&lt;ref name="adb1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whitedivers1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="otemon1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shigematsu|first=Shinji |year=2007|title=Research Note on Pearling and Japanese Contribution to Local Society in early 20th century Australia|journal=The Otemon Journal of Australian Studies|publisher=Otemon Gakuin University|volume=33|pages=93|url=http://www.otemon.ac.jp/cas/pdf/33/shigematsu33.pdf|accessdate=18 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the local economy began to experience difficulties he was forced to sell his business and he was engaged by pearler Ancell Clement Gregory to manage the Dampier Hotel. In 1918 his wife left him and returned to Japan, dying soon after. He was remarried in 1920 to Shigeno "Theresa" Murata at the Broome Registry Office.&lt;ref name="adb1" /&gt;

In 1921 Murakami and Gregory formed a joint venture to produce cultured pearls, however government intervention scuppered the plans. Murakimi's and Gregory's friendship caused consternation among the class-conscious local community.&lt;ref name="adb1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whitedivers1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="otemon1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="heritage1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/M%20-%20A-D/00290%20Matso's%20Store%20&amp;%20Capt%20Greg%20(I-AD).PDF|title=Captain Gregory's House|work=Register of Heritage Places|publisher=Heritage Council of Western Australia|accessdate=18 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jockey===
Murakami rode for trainer Ted Hunt in races at the Broome Turf Club with some success.&lt;ref name="whitedivers1" /&gt;

===Diving suit===
In 1926 developed a patent for a suit for pearl divers that was lighter and more manoeuvrable than traditional suits.&lt;ref name="patent1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.google.gr/patents?id=cxVFAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;source=gbs_overview_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false

===Darwin===
In 1936, with Gregory's assistance, he and his family moved to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. In Darwin he operated a successful photography business.&lt;ref name="adb1" /&gt;

===World War II===
With the onset of World War II and as a Japanese born Australian resident he was interned at the [[Tatura, Victoria|Tatura]] internment camp in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].&lt;ref name="adb1" /&gt; He was separated from his family after he was accused of being a Japanese spy.&lt;ref name="darwin1" /&gt;

==Death==
Murakami died on 26 June 1944 at Tatura of a heart condition. His name was survived by his second wife and their nine children. He was buried at a local cemetery but was later reinterred at the Japanese Cemetery in [[Cowra, New South Wales]].&lt;ref name="adb1" /&gt;
