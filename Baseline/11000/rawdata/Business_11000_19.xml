{{Unreferenced|date=March 2007}} Note: Reference cited below, FAS130, remains the most current accounting literature in the United States on this topic. 

In 1997 the [[United States]] [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] issued [[List of FASB Pronouncements|Statement on Financial Accounting Standards]] No. 130 entitled “Reporting Comprehensive Income”.  This statement required all [[income statement]] items to be reported either as a regular item in the income statement or a special item as other comprehensive income.  It is commonly referred to as FAS130. 

==Comprehensive income==
''[[Comprehensive income]]'' is the total non-owner change in equity for a reporting period.  This change encompasses all changes in equity other than transactions from owners and distributions to owners.  Most of these changes appear in the income statement.  A few special types of gains and losses are not shown in the income statement but as special items in shareholder equity section of the balance sheet.  

Since these comprehensive income items are not closed to retained earnings each period they accumulate as shareholder equity items and thus are entitled “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” and is sometimes referred to as "AOCI".

'''Accumulated other comprehensive income''' is a subsection in [[Shareholders' equity|equity]] where "other comprehensive income" is accumulated (summed or "aggregated").  

The balance of AOCI is presented in the Equity section of the Balance Sheet as is the Retained Earnings balance, which aggregates past and current Earnings, and past and current Dividends.

==Other comprehensive income==
''Other comprehensive income'' is the difference between [[net income]] as in the [[Income Statement]] (Profit or Loss Account) and [[comprehensive income]], and represents the certain gains and losses of the [[Wiktionary:enterprise|enterprise]] not recognized in the P&amp;L Account. It is commonly referred to as '''"OCI"'''.

In practice, it comprises the following items:
# Unrealized gains and losses on [[available for sale]] [[Security (finance)|securities]] [IAS 39/ ''"FAS 115" – "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt Securities"'']
# Gains and losses on [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] held as [[cash flow hedge]]s (only for effective portions) [IAS 39/ ''"FAS 133" – "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"'']
# Gains and losses resulting from translating the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries (from foreign currency to the presentation currency) [IAS 21/ ''"FAS 52" – "Foreign Currency Translation"''], 
# Actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit plans recognized (Minimum [[pension]] liability adjustments) [IAS 19/ ''"FAS 158" – "Employers' Accounting For Defined Benefit Pension And Other Postretirement Plans"'']
# Changes in the [[revaluation of fixed assets#Upward Revaluation of Fixed Assets|revaluation]] surplus [IAS 16 and IAS 38].

While the AOCI balance is presented in Equity section of the [[balance sheet]], the annual accounting entries, as flows, are presented sometimes in a [[Statement of Comprehensive Income]]. This statement expands the traditional [[Income Statement]] beyond Earnings to include OCI in order to present Comprehensive Income. 

Under the revised IAS 1, all non-owner changes in equity ([[comprehensive income]]) must be presented ''either'' in one Statement of comprehensive income or in two statements (a separate income statement and a statement of comprehensive income).
  

===Reclassification to profit or loss (P&amp;L)===
Flows presented initially in OCI sometimes are reclassified into Earnings (Profit or Loss) when certain conditions are met. For the five types of OCI described above, the triggers for reclassification are presented in the accounting standard that gives rise to the OCI flow.

===Alterations to definition of OCI===
In the United States further alterations to this OCI definition occur when a new standard (including a revision of a previously issued accounting standard) identifies an item that can be measured, should be measured in the financial statements, represents a "flow" variable rather than a stock, or snapshot, variable, and does not represent a flow variable that should be presented in the Income Statement as a component of Earnings. The flow variable that is both measurable and should be recognized is then added to the list above of items that a reporting entity would include in AOCI. 

In the third quarter of 2008 the United States Securities and Exchange Commission received several proposals to allow the recognition in AOCI of certain fair value changes on financial instruments. This proposal was initially well received by representatives of the banking community who felt that Earnings recognition of these fair value changes during the concurrent "credit meltdown of 2008" would be inappropriate. The effect of this proposal, on balance, would be to remove sizeable losses from Earnings and thus Retained Earnings of banks, and assist them in preserving their regulatory capital. The regulatory capital of banks in the US and generally worldwide includes contributed equity capital and retained earnings but excludes AOCI, even though it is reported as a component of the Equity section of the Balance Sheet.

The FASB released an Accounting Standards Update on January 5, 2016 that changes items reported in OCI. Previously, equity securities could be classified as available for sale, and unrecognized gains and losses on these securities appeared in OCI. However, per this update, there is no longer an available for sale classification for equity securities if the fair value of these securities can be readily determined. Changes in the fair value of equity investments in unconsolidated entities flow through earnings for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.

'''Alasdair Antony Kenneth White''' (born May 24, 1952) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] management theorist best known for his work on [[performance management]] from a behavioural perspective and in the field of deconcentrated and networked organizations.  Along with John Fairhurst, White developed the White-Fairhurst Performance Hypothesis relating to the performance life-cycle. He is also the author of ''Continuous Quality Improvement'' and ''The Essential Guide to Developing Your Staff''.

==Research==
In 2006, he worked closely with John Fairhurst and, following various observational studies, they formulated the White-Fairhurst Performance Hypothesis which states that "all performance will initially trend towards a steady state, particularly after a period of performance uplift, and that steady state will then develop a downward curve leading to a significant performance decline".

[[File:White-Fairhurst TPR Model.jpg|thumb|250px|right|White-Fairhurst TPR Model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pm-solutions.com/ComfortZone_Performance.html |title=From Comfort Zone to Performance Management |last=Alasdair |first=White |date=November 2009 |publisher=Performance Management Solutions |accessdate=29 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421085837/http://www.pm-solutions.com/ComfortZone_Performance.html |archivedate=21 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In a paper entitled ''From Comfort Zone to Performance Management'', White examines the hypothesis from a theoretical perspective starting with the [[Comfort Zone Theory]] and the work of [[Robert Yerkes]] and John Dodson, David McClelland et al., the [[Tuckman Model]] and Colin Carnall. This theoretical examination leads White to conclude that the White-Fairhurst Hypothesis broadly holds true and the performance curve is as demonstrated in the White-Fairhurst TPR Life-cycle Model (TPR stands for Transforming, Performing, Reforming). There has been some criticism of White’s approach, suggesting that more recent sources and work would have been more appropriate, but none have been able to offer a counter-argument or to adequately refute or dispute the hypothesis. The fact remains that most of the fundamentals of performance behaviour were established in the last century and that the more recent work is itself based on this earlier work.

White argues that what is important now is to determine trend-change points on the performance curve so that the most appropriate performance management actions can be applied. He conducted research within a university environment in this relation to this and the result is recorded in his 2008 essay ''Managing Academic Performance'' the underlying theory of which underpins the approach being adopted by a number of academic institutions.

==Writing==
In addition to writing on management issues, White is also active in writing and editing fiction for White &amp; MacLean Publishing. Among those writings include the a political and action novel ''Shadows'', written under the pen-name of Alex Hunter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5789">'''Annie Bindon Carter''' [[MBE]] (1883–1969) was a British entrepreneur, businesswoman and philanthropist.

[[File:Annie Bindon Carter.jpg|thumb|Mrs Annie Bindon Carter MBE (1883-1969), co-founder of Painted Fabrics, Sheffield]]

== Early life ==

Annie Bindon Carter was born in Nottingham, England in 1883 and educated at Ladies’ Moravian School in Oakbrook, Derby. She excelled at art and design and won a scholarship to study at Sheffield Technical School of Art.&lt;ref&gt;City of Sheffield Education Committee Annual Prize Giving Ceremony, Mappin Art Gallery 1906 (brochure) p.2 &amp; p.6 and City of Sheffield Education Committee Annual Prize Giving Ceremony, Mappin Art Gallery, Sheffield, 1908 (brochure) p.7 &amp; p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

Annie, together with three other ex-art school students, her sister Dorothy Bindon Carter, Phyllis Lawton and [[Edith Jagger]], all volunteered at [[Middlewood Hospital|Wharncliffe War Hospital]], Sheffield during 1915/16. They assisted in the rehabilitation of servicemen returning injured from the Great War through informal art classes. The four women went on to found Painted Fabrics in 1917, with the aim of 'establishing a charitable organisation which would actively rehabilitate severely injured ex-servicemen through occupational therapy'.&lt;ref&gt;Nutt, Elizabeth Strying. ‘Sheffield Technical School of Art Student Magazine’ (Winter 1918) Volume 1, Number 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Painted Fabrics ==

The result was Painted Fabrics, a ground breaking charitable organisation designed to enable severely disabled soldiers and sailors, which included double amputees and those suffering from shell shock to work and to have a roof over their and their families' heads. A policy which adhered to the company's motto 'Work not Charity'.

Annie, was the wife of the successful Sheffield industrialist, Geoffrey Carter, who was himself, a serving officer abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Nutt, Elizabeth Strying. ‘Sheffield Technical School of Art Student Magazine’ (Winter 1918) Volume 1, Number 2&lt;/ref&gt; From the outset, Annie, being the dominant personality of the group was instrumental in making sure Painted Fabrics became a limited company in 1923. The company then acquired the lease to a former army camp at Norton, on the south-west edge of Sheffield. The wooden huts became print and design workshops and accommodation was supplied to the men and their families.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, Hilary. ‘Sheffield Artists 1840-1940’. Published by The Basement Gallery, Sheffield. 1996 p.11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The ex-servicemen hand-printed designs onto various fabrics, using a wide variety of printing techniques. These fabrics were then made up into a myriad of ‘Painted Fabrics products’, which included dresses, table cloths and curtains.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Annie Bindon Carter.jpg|thumbnail]] --&gt;
Annie, affectionately known as ''ABC'' by the employees of Painted Fabrics, dealt with the day-to-day running of the company. She acted as the conduit between the men, the press and the companies illustrious board. As one of the company's five directors and Honorary Secretary, Annie used her administrative skills perfectly, through her, the company were conferred with several [[Royal warrant of appointment|Royal Warrants]]. She was awarded an [[MBE]] in 1926, in recognition of her work ‘for disabled soldiers and sailors’.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, Malcolm Leary. ‘Painted With Pride’. Published by RMC Books, Sheffield. 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sheffield Telegraph|Sheffield Daily Telegraph]], in August 1930, wrote about Annie in the ‘Who’s Who in Sheffield’ ; ''It is difficult to write of Mrs. Carter without giving the history of Painted Fabrics, as she has been so closely associated with it. The greatness of the work has often over-shadowed the personality of its originator, who is one of the simplest and happiest of people. An instance of the fine effect that living for others has upon one’s own outlook.''&lt;ref&gt;The Sheffield Daily Telegraph, 16 August 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1930’s, Painted Fabrics Limited employed 36 ex-servicemen and also supported their immediate families. The administration of Painted Fabrics took up most of her time. Despite national press coverage, exhibitions and displays across the country, sales fluctuated and the company faced continual financial hardship. The company effectively ceased in 1939, when the companies site at Norton was requisitioned by the War Office. Painted Fabrics was re-established after World War Two finished, though not to the same extent as its earlier incarnation. Driven by Annie’s self-belief it continued through until it was officially closed in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/exhibition/anniebindoncarter&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later years ==

She was awarded an honorary M.A. by the University of Sheffield in 1959. After a visit to the newly built main university library in 1961 (renamed Western Bank Library), she presented the librarian with a cheque for £1,000. These funds were used to purchase ‘outstanding examples of modern book production by private presses’.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/exhibition/anniebindoncarter&lt;/ref&gt;

Annie died in 1969. A blue plaque was unveiled in 2000, at the former site of Painted Fabrics, the plaque described Annie Bindon Carter as a ‘humanitarian’. An exhibition featuring work produced by Painted Fabrics entitled ‘Business and Benefaction: the colourful life of Sheffield artist Annie Bindon Carter’, was held at Weston Bank Library, The University of Sheffield in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/exhibition/anniebindoncarter&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BrandZ''' is a [[brand equity]] [[database]] managed by the marketing firm [[Millward Brown]].

==Controversy==
{{Undue weight section|date=August 2018}} 
The credibility of the [[Interbrand]] and BrandZ league tables have been cast into doubt by an article written in [[Marketing Week]] by Mark Ritson.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/sectors/industry/brand-valuations-do-not-always-tell-the-full-story/3030524.article&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of clear definitions and valuation dates in the both companies methodology raise questions about the subjectivity involved in brand valuations. Being part of multinational advertising groups, Interbrand and Kantar Millward Brown also suffer from the risk of objectivity. [[Transparency (behavior)|Transparency]] and objectivity are two of the requirements of the [[ISO 10668]] standard of monetary brand valuations.

CSEM-BMP was founded as the Brunel Environmental Management Programme (BEMP)&lt;ref name="brady_2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hutchinson_1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DfE_1993" /&gt;  or the Environmental Management Centre (EMC) within the [[Brunel Management Programme]] (BMP) by [[Ken Knight (environmentalist)|Ken Knight]] and [[Ross King (environmentalist)|Ross King]].&lt;ref name="imperial_college_2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brady_2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="king_1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brady_2011" /&gt; The EMC later became the Centre for Sustainable and Environmental Management (CSEM),&lt;ref name="imperial_college_2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brady_2004" /&gt; then the Centre for Sustainability and Environmental Management (CSEM)&lt;ref name="rob_2010" /&gt;  and is now known as CSEM-BMP.&lt;ref name="green_energy_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brady_2011" /&gt;

Through the EMC, BMP offered the first and largest broad senior level environmental management programme in Europe.&lt;ref name="brady_2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brady_2011" /&gt;

By 1993 the BEMP had organised 39 short courses, with 380 attendees.&lt;ref name="charter_1993" /&gt;

The EMC established the first modular masters degree in Environmental Management in 1993 / 1994.&lt;ref name="brady_2011" /&gt;

By the end of 1994 about 1000 managers had attended EMC courses.&lt;ref name="king_1993" /&gt;

From that time the focus of the EMC was on both identifying and disseminating the requisite management knowledge and theory so that directors and managers could lead their organizations towards economically advantageous environmental and social sustainability.&lt;ref name="brady_2011" /&gt;

Work has been done by CSEM-BMP on management development provision for each business function (such as purchasing, operations, marketing, and logistics) rethinking the function from a sustainability perspective, so that each function can relieve overburdened environmental specialists.&lt;ref name="brady_2011" /&gt;

== Sustainability Leadership Programme ==

In 2010 CSEM-BMP offered the Sustainability Leadership Programme (SLP) of Integrated Sustainability Management for Business. The programme offered by CSEM-BMP is for developing leadership and management. The programme is designed against the curriculum for an MBA, is based on sustainability principles and designed to meet the needs of each business function, process and level. It is designed for the needs of senior functional managers, those wishing to move into these positions, and those that need to communicate to such people. Being modular individual courses can be taken or combined in any combination including as a Masters programme.&lt;ref name="rob_2010" /&gt;

Each module on the SLP comprise one week of study and an eight-week work-based assignment. Assignments on the SLP are generally to apply the material from the module and further reading to participant's own organisation in the form of a board level paper. Additional support is provided on the SLP in the form of tutorials and self organised learning groups.&lt;ref name="rob_2010" /&gt;

The SLP highlights that any environmental or sustainability initiative requires a sound business case. It examines current management understanding and what needs to be done differently or better to operate with environmental and social limits. Core modules on the SLP help participants 'sit behind a chair' at the boardroom table, providing the ability to talk to board members and act as change agents in their organisation.&lt;ref name="rob_2010" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is for the reader, in the light of subsequent events, to judge how far the Councillors were right or wrong, and to see for himself who really did the pioneer work of building up the prosperity of Perak. In the published accounts of British rule in Malaya, sufficient prominence has not always been given to the efforts of these early pioneers; the reaper, intent on his own work, is apt to forget the man who sowed. These Council Minutes are the record of the work of the sowers. A study of that record will show how much the State owes to Sir Hugh Low and to his fellow-Councillors, especially Raja Dris (the present Sultan), Sir William Maxwell, and the Chinese [[:wikt:towkay|towkays]], ''Ah Kwi'' [Chung Keng Quee] and Ah Yam."&lt;ref&gt;Preface by General Editor [[Richard James Wilkinson]], History, Part III, Council Minutes, Perak, 1877 - 1879, Papers on Malay Subjects (Published by direction of the Government of the [[Federated Malay States]] by [[Richard James Wilkinson]])&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Early history ==
Third among his father's five sons, Chung Keng Quee was born into a peasant [[Hakka people|Hakka]] family in Xin Cun (新村) village, Cheng Sheng (Zengcheng 增城) county of [[Guangdong]] province, [[People's Republic of China|China]]. &lt;br /&gt; At the time of his death the Perak Pioneer &amp; Native States Advertiser VOL VIII Taiping Saturday 14 December 1901 reports: &lt;blockquote&gt;''"Precise information as to the date of his arrival in Perak is difficult to obtain but it is apparently certain that he has passed over forty-five years in the State before he retired to Penang."''&lt;/blockquote&gt; It is believed that in 1841, he journeyed from China to [[British Malaya]] in a junk, sent by his mother, Madam Lai, to look for his father, Chung, Hsing Fah (Chung, Xingfa 郑兴发; [[Hakka]]: Chang Hin Fatt). He had left his wife (Madam Lin) in China to look after his elderly mother.&lt;ref&gt;See 'Chia-pi-tan Cheng Ching-kuei' (Kapitan Chung Keng Quee) and 'Cheng Ching-kuei kung yen-p'ei Lin fu-jen (Madam Lin: Wife of Chung Keng Quee), in Chang Wei-yung (editor), Hsin Ma Tseng Lung hui-kuan lien-ho t'e-k'an (Souvenir Magazine of the Tseng Lung Association in Singapore and Malaysia), Penang, 1969 pp 57-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kek Lok Si: Temple of Paradise by Choon-san Wong, Malaysian Sociological Research Institute, 1963 pp93&lt;/ref&gt; He is thought to have been 20 years of age at that time.&lt;ref&gt;广东省地方史志编纂委员会, 2010. 广东省志: 华侨志 - Volume 47 of 广东省志, 广东省地方史志编纂委员会(Local Chronicles Compilation Committee of Guangdong Province, 2010. Guangdong Province zhi: Huaqiao zhi Volume 47 of Guangdong Province, Chi , Local Chronicles Compilation Committee of Guangdong Province.)&lt;/ref&gt; Chung Hsing Fa, had come to Malaya as an [[indentured]] labourer during a time of great turbulence in China to make a living and support his family in China (see [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s and [[Taiping Rebellion]]). After some time when Madam Lai received no news from her husband she sent Chung Keng Seng  (鄭景勝 / 郑景胜), her second son. Still receiving no news, she then sent Keng Quee. When Keng Quee arrived in Perak, he discovered that both his father Hsing Fa and his brother Keng Seng were by that time well established in business. In fact, Keng Seng was so popular he was known as Lui Kong Seng (literally Thunder God Seng). His father, Hsing Fa was one of the early leaders of the Tseng Lung association on King Street.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese in Penang By KimHong Tan (陈剑虹), 2007 p.54&lt;/ref&gt; Keng Quee entered the mining business which his father and brother were engaged in. By 1860 he controlled the Penang-based [[Hai San Secret Society]] as well as the Larut tin-fields the Hai San were associated with. Information about his career before that time is generally unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Kek Lok Si: Temple of Paradise By Choon-san Wong, Malaysian Sociological Research Institute, 1963, pp 11, 93, 127&lt;/ref&gt;

== Names ==
Chung's name has been spelt in many different ways due to differences of dialect and transliteration. Apart from Chung Keng Quee, the name has also been spelt Cheng Ching-kuei,&lt;ref&gt;Franke and Chen Vol II page 895&lt;/ref&gt; Chang Ching-kuei, Chung Keng Kwee&lt;ref&gt;Wong 1963 page 77&lt;/ref&gt; and Chang Ah Quee (Hanyu Pinyin: Zhèng Yàguì; Traditional:鄭亞貴; Simplified:郑亚贵).&lt;ref&gt;Yen 1995 page 337&lt;/ref&gt; Chung has also been spelt Chang, Chan, Cheng, Cheang. Keng has also been spelt Chin, Kung, King etc. Quee has also been spelt Kooi, Kwee, Kwi, Kuei and Kui. He has also been known as Teh Keng Quee (Zheng4 is Teh in Hokkien), Ah Quee, Ah Kwi, Ah Kooi etc. Upon receiving his honorary title from the Chinese Imperial Court, he took to using the "fancy" names Cheng Sheng Chih,&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin of the Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica - Issues 61-64 - Page 98&lt;/ref&gt; Cheang Shin Thong and Cheng Ssu-Wen (鄭嗣文 / 郑嗣文).&lt;ref&gt;Franke and Chen Vol II page 816&lt;/ref&gt;

== Larut Wars ==
{{anchor|The Larut Wars}}
Around 1848 'Che Long Ja'afar introduced Chinese miners to Larut (spelt Laroot or Larot at that time). The original mine field, Klian Pauh is where the jail at Taiping stands today. Long Ja'afar appointed Low Sam from Penang as agent and Low Sam was associated with Chung Keng Quee.&lt;ref&gt;The Impact of Chinese Secret Societies in Malaya: A Historical Study By Blythe, Wilfred, Published 1969 Issued under the auspices of the Royal Institute of International Affairs [by] Oxford U.

According to Chung Keng Quee in his evidence provided to the Straits Government, the development of the Larut tin fields was initiated by Malay Chief 'Che Long Ja'afar by advancing money to the Chinese miners in his district to work the mines and it was only in his son [[Ngah Ibrahim]]'s time (c. 1858-74) that the Chinese worked the mines with their own money.&lt;ref&gt;(Evidence of Ah Kwee, Report of Larot Commissioners, 21 February 1874, Swettenham papers, No 72)&lt;/ref&gt;

At a time when [[:ms:Ngah Ibrahim|Ngah Ibrahim]] was administrator of Larut the Chinese had increased in number and in early 1860 two large groups were formed by the Chinese, the "Five Associations" whose members worked in the mines of [[Klian Pauh]] and the "Four Associations" whose members worked in the mines of Klian Baharu.

Mining rights were given to the Hakka "Five Associations" or Go-Kuan ({{zh|c=五馆}} or {{zh|c=五群}}) ([[Hakka]]: Ng Khiun) and the Cantonese "Four Associations" or Si-Kuan (四馆). Chung Keng Quee was leader of the [[Hakka people|Hakka]] Go-Kuan and the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiawind.com/pub/forum/fhakka/mhonarc/msg00532.html Hai San]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiawind.com/pub/forum/fhakka/mhonarc/msg00532.html Hakka secret society in Malaya - Hai San by "Dixie"]&lt;/ref&gt; ({{zh|c=海山}}) ([[Hakka]]: Hoi San) society they were aligned with and began to operate his tin mines in [[Larut]] (see [[Larut, Matang]]) in 1860.

Many Hakka fled China when the [[Taiping Rebellion]] broke out there and found work in the mines of Chung, Keng Quee establishing his position over the mining area in Larut as leader of the Hai San from 1860 to 1884.

Larut was destined to be plagued by four major wars between members of the [[Ghee Hin Kongsi|Ghee Hin Society]] ({{zh|c=义兴私会党}}) that owned the Cantonese Si-Kuan on the one hand and the Hakka [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] and Hokkien Tua Pek Kong societies on the other hand. While the first of the Larut wars broke out over land and water rights, the rivalry between the two groups already existed in Ujong Salang, Selangor, Penang, Singapore and Kwangtung itself where both groups fought with each other between 1855 and 1868.&lt;ref name="sea"/&gt;

To many people it appeared that the trouble in Larut was merely a continuation of the trouble between the Ghee Hin and Tua Pek Kong societies in Ujong Salang in 1859 which later spread to Penang. The Larut Wars were fought between Hakka and Hakka. The [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] miners were mainly Hakka men from Cheng Sheng. The first two battles (1861 and 1865) were between the Cheng Sheng Hakka of the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] and the Hui Chew Hakka of the Ghee Hin. The Last two (1872 and 1873) were between the Cheng Sheng Hakka of the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] and the Sin Neng Hakka of the Ghee Hin, the Hui Chew Hakka from the Ghee Hin from the earlier two battles having gone down to Selangor to join Yap Ah Loy, a Hui Chew Hakka who was head of the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] in Selangor. Lee Ah Kun (Lee Ko Yin), Ho Ghi Siu and Chin Seng Yam (陈亚炎, Chin Ah Yam 陳亞炎) were Sin Neng Hakka.

=== First Larut War (1861) ===
The First Larut War began in July 1861 when arguments over control of watercourse to their mines escalated and led members of the Hai San Society to drive the members of the Ghee Hin society out of Klian Bahru (now known as [[Kamunting]]). [[List of British Governors of the Straits Settlements|The Governor of Straits Settlement]], Colonel [[William Orfeur Cavenagh]] intervened and the Mentri of Larut, Ngah Ibrahim, was made to compensate the Ghee Hin with $17,447 on behalf of the Sultan of Perak.&lt;ref name="Comber"&gt;Chinese Secret Societies in Malaya: A Survey of the Triad Society from 1800 to 1900 By Leon Comber Published for the Association for Asian Studies by J.J. Augustin, 1959 pp. 102, 158, 165&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second Larut War (1865) ===
[[The Second Larut War]] took place in 1865 and was sparked off by a gambling quarrel in June of that year between members of the two opposing secret societies. According to Parkinson in his book British Intervention in Malaya 1867-1877 the "[[Hai San Secret Society|Hysan]] or Tokong" leader in Penang was "Chan Keng Kwi", with "Lew Ah Sam" as leader in Larut.&lt;ref name="Modern South-East Asia p. 300"&gt;The Making of Modern South-East Asia: The Western Impact - Economic and Social Change V. 2 By D. J. M. Tate Published by Oxford University Press, 1971 p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hai San members took 14 Ghee Hin as prisoners, 13 of whom were killed. The 14th escaped to inform his clan and the Ghee Hin retaliated by attacking the Hai San village, razing it to the ground and killing 40 men in the process.

The battle continued back and forth and spread to Province Wellesley and the island of Penang and other secret societies joined the fray. Both sides, exhausted, finally came to terms. An official inquiry took place and both the Hai San and Ghee Hin societies were fined $5,000 each for violating the peace of Penang and their leaders, banished.

So Ah Chiang, leader of the Ghee Hin was captured by Ngah Ibrahim at Teluk Kertang (Port Weld) and executed.&lt;ref name="Modern South-East Asia p. 300"/&gt;

By around 1870 there were a combined total of about 40,000 Hakka and Cantonese mine workers in the Larut district and the mining areas between the two groups were near to each other. It is this proximity that might explain how the next battle began.

=== Third Larut War (1872) ===
According to Charles John Irving, then Auditor-General of the Straits Settlements, and later Acting Lieutenant-Governor of Penang, there were about 20,000 to 25,000 Chinese in Larut around February 1872, 2,000 to 3,000 of whom were Cantonese or "Macao Men" as he referred to them, and the remainder being Khay (Hakka) men from Cheng Sheng and Sin Neng.&lt;ref&gt;Memo dated 24 July 1872, Charles John Irving.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Ong Ah Yu to Captain Speedy, 18 October 1872.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1872 Cheng Sheng miners had a dispute with Sin Neng miners over the boundaries of some mining lands. Lee Ah Kun (Lee Ko Yin) represented the Sin Neng and attempted to negotiate but was murdered on 16 February on the pretext of an adulterous affair.

It has been believed that The Third Larut War erupted in 1872 over a scandal involving the Lee Ah Kun (李亞勤 / 李亚勤), the attorney at Larut (for the Ghee Hin leader Ho Ghi Sui) and the wife of a nephew of the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] leader, Chung, Keng Quee. It is said that upon discovery, the allegedly adulterous couple was caught, tortured, put into a pig basket ({{zh|s=猪笼|t=豬籠}}) and thrown into a disused mining pond where they drowned.&lt;ref name="sea"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A History of Perak By Richard Olof Winstedt, [[Richard James Wilkinson]], William Edward Maxwell, Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland Malaysian Branch Published by Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1974. Previously published as volume XII, part 1, Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in June 1934, and in volumes 2, 9 &amp; 12 of the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1878, 1882 and 1883.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;History of Malaya (1400-1959): 1400 - 1959 By Joginder Singh Jessy Published by Jointly published by United Publishers and Peninsular Publications, 1961 p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

Supposedly to avenge the death of their leader, the Ghee Hin had 4,000 professional fighting men (brought in from China via Penang) attack the Hai Sans. For the first time, the Hai Sans were driven out of Larut. About 10,000 Hai San men sought sanctuary in Penang. It took months before the Hai Sans, supported by Ngah Ibrahim recovered their Matang and Larut mines.

Others hold that the alleged "intrigue" never happened and was merely a [[political fiction]] to justify the murder of Ah Kun (aka Lee Coyn) in a manner that would permit Tokong to save face for the death sentence passed down on their leader Khoo Thean Tek for his part in the Penang Riots of 1869 where Ah Kun apparently got off Scot free.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6irEoGgDrm4C&amp;lpg=PA276&amp;dq=%22chang%20Keng%22&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA276#v=onepage&amp;q=%22chang%20Keng%22&amp;f=false - ''Triad And Tabut - Triad societies: western accounts of the history, sociology and linguistics of Chinese secret societies''] by Mervyn Llewelyn Wynne, Kingsley Bolton, Christopher Hutton, James K. Chin, edited by Kingsley Bolton, Christopher Hutton, published by Taylor &amp; Francis, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-415-24397-1}}, Pg 276&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The story of his "intrigue with the wife of a near relative of Chang Keng Kwi" is difficult to accept as genuine, when we consider the conditions at the mines in those days. The trade in women was part and parcel of the Triad-Tokong system and the Chinese women at the mines probably went to the highest bidder. Chinese coming overseas did not bring their wives with them and it is highly improbable that "the near relative of Ah Kwi" whose name is not given but who will have been a Hakka and a Tokong, would have had any woman in his household but a Cantonese (Triad) prostitute, whose death meant nothing to the Tokongs and was merely an added sacrifice incidental to the death of Li Ah Kun upon the altar of Tokong vengeance." - Triad and tabut: a survey of the origin and diffusion of Chinese and Mohamedan secret societies in the Malay Peninsula, A.D. 1800-1935, Parts 1800-1935 by Mervyn Llewelyn Wynne, Government Printing Office, 1941, Pg 276&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, Raja Abdullah a claimant to the royal throne of Perak and an enemy of Ngah Ibrahim, took sides against the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai Sans]] and Ngah Ibrahim.&lt;ref name="sea"/&gt;

On 26 September 1872, Chung Keng Quee signed a petition together with 44 other Chinese leaders, seeking British interference following the attack of 12,000 men of Chung Shan by 2,000 men of Sen Ning. (See [[s:The Petition of Chung Keng Quee &amp; 44 Others|The Petition of Chung Keng Quee &amp; 44 Others]] and [[s:The humble petition of Ah Yeu, Ung Keng Sin, Soh Ah Pang, Su Ah Fooed, and others|The humble petition of Ah Yeu, Ung Keng Sin, Soh Ah Pang, Su Ah Fooed, and others]])

=== Fourth Larut War (1873) ===
The Fourth Larut War occurred in 1873, merely a year after the previous battle. Weeks after the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai Sans]] regained Larut, the Ghee Hin, supported by [[Sultan Abdullah of Perak|Raja Abdullah]], counter-attacked with arms and men from [[Singapore]] and [[China]]. Ngah Ibrahim's properties in Matang were destroyed. Local Malay residents were also killed and their property, destroyed. Trouble spread to Krian, Pangkor and Dindings.

The quarrelling Malay chiefs who had taken sides in the Larut Wars were now alarmed at the disorder created by the Chinese miners and secret societies.  The Straits Settlement Penang Chinese seeing their investments destroyed in the Larut Wars sought intervention form British. Over 40,000 Chinese from the Go-Kuan and Si-Kuan were engaged in the fratricidal war involving the Perak royal family.

In August 1873, [[Edward Anson|Archibald Edward Harbord Anson]], the last Lieutenant-Governor of Penang, sought to bring about a ceasefire between the two parties and convened a meeting at the beginning of the month attended, apart from Anson, by Chung Keng Quee ([[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]]), Ho Ghi Sui (Ghee Hin), [[Foo Tye Sin]] (pro-[[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]]), Ngah Ibrahim (pro-Hai San), Abdullah (pro-Ghee Hin), Tengku Kudin (pro-Abdullah) and a British Naval Captain.&lt;ref name="Comber"/&gt;

The two sides agreed to keep the peace pending British arbitration with Ngah Ibrahim taking responsibility for the Hai San and Abdullah taking responsibility for the Ghee Hin. Abdullah failed so completely in his task in ensuring the Ghee Hin kept the peace that the British were prompted to back Ngah Ibrahim and the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]].

On 3 September 1873 outgoing Straits Settlements Governor Sir [[Harry Ord]] recognised Ngah Ibrahim, through a proclamation, as the independent (i.e. independent of Perak rule) ruler of Larut.  On 5 September he temporarily lifted an arms embargo (imposed since February) just long enough for the Hai San in Larut to receive munitions.  In the middle of that month a British vessel got into an entanglement with some Ghee Hin junks and this led to British bombardment and capture of Ghee hin stockades at Matang and Kuala Selinsing.

Ngah Ibrahim's Penang residence was blown up on 16 September 1873. A week later two things happened - a similar attempt was made on Chung Keng Quee's house and Abdullah and his Ghee Hin cohorts were arrested at sea and brought back to Penang where they were eventually released but forbidden to return to Perak.&lt;ref&gt;Governor's Despatch 271, 19 September 1873 (C.111, p. 46)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abdullah's mission to Singapore ===
Meantime the Perak sultanate, involved in a protracted succession struggle was unable to maintain order. Things were increasingly getting out of hand and chaos was proving bad for the Malays, Chinese and British. In her book "The Golden Chersonese and The Way Thither" (Published 1892 G.P. Putnam's Sons) Victorian traveller and adventuress [[Isabella Bird|Isabella Lucy Bird]] (1831–1904) describes how Raja Muda Abdullah as he then was turned to the head of the Ghee Hin in Singapore, [[Tan Kim Ching]].

Abdullah met with Tan in Singapore in October 1873. He was accompanied by Raja Dris, the Shahbandar and a Penang lawyer. Tan offered to put Abdullah on the throne in return for five elevenths (5/11) of all duties collected between Telok Serah and Krian for a period of ten years.

[[Tan Kim Ching]] introduced Abdullah to [[William Henry Macleod Read]] (W. H. M. Read) and Read in turn introduced Abdullah to Sir Henry Ord on the eve of Ord's retirement as Governor of the Straits Settlements. A letter was drafted by Tan and Read on Abdullah's behalf to new incoming Governor Sir Andrew Clarke seeking British recognition of Abdullah as ruler of Perak, British protection and the provision of "a man of sufficient abilities to live with us in Perak. .. and show us a good system of government for our dominions. .."

The letter dated 30 December 1873 did not reach Clarke's hands till 9 January 1874 by which time he had already taken the first steps towards bringing Perak under British control.

=== Sir Andrew Clarke takes charge ===
Clarke's main objective was to mediate peace between the two Chinese factions and settle their differences so that tin production could resume and threats to the internal security of British-held Penang would cease. [[C. Northcote Parkinson|Parkinson]] tells us in British Intervention in Malaya 1867-1877 that [[Andrew Clarke (administrator)|Sir Andrew Clarke]] decided to summon the Chinese factions to a conference following a meeting on or about 9 January 1874 between Chung Keng Quee and the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] headmen and [[W.A. Pickering|Pickering]] (together with [[John Frederick Adolphus McNair|McNair]] and [[Samuel Dunlop|Dunlop]]) who had been sent to meet them at the mouth of the Larut River to persuade them to accept arbitration.&lt;ref name="sea"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Making of Modern South-East Asia: economic and social change By D. J. M. Tate Published by Oxford University Press, 1971 Item notes: v.1; p. 279, 300&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malaya pp. 80, 124"&gt;British Intervention in Malaya, 1867-1877 By Cyril Northcote Parkinson Published by University of Malaya Press, 1960; pp. 80, 124, 127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pickering: Protector of Chinese. A Biography by R. N. Jackson.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Andrew Clarke, just weeks after his arrival in Singapore, had already found evidence of the continuing disturbances in Perak and Selangor. Apart from his executive council, he talked to [[Tan Kim Ching]]. Clarke decided that both the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] and Ghee Hin should have access to Larut with neither side being excluded, a complete reversal of the policy of his predecessor, Sir Henry Ord. Tan Kim Ching agreed and wrote to the Ghee Hin at Penang to put this to them and advocate peace.&lt;ref name="Malaya pp. 80, 124"/&gt;

Clarke then sent Pickering to Penang to talk to the respective headmen in Penang. Pickering gave Tan Kim Ching's letter to Chin Ah Yam (陳亞炎 / 陈亚炎). Twenty Ghee Hin headmen met through the night at the Ghee Hin Kongsi house considering [[Tan Kim Ching]]'s letter. In the morning they met with Pickering and agreed to surrender their forces in seven days time.&lt;ref name="Malaya pp. 80, 124"/&gt; It was also at this time that Clarke saw an opportunity to settle the question of succession to the throne in Perak and to make use of that as a means to further British interests in the Malay Peninsula by getting the sultan to accept a British Resident.

Following the surrender of the Ghee Hin to Pickering and the outcome of a meeting with Chung Keng Quee whom Pickering also met, Sir Andrew Clarke then gathered the main Chinese leaders (principally Chung Keng Quee and Chin Ah Yam and some Malays – including Abdullah – at Pulau Pangkor where the 'Pangkor Engagement' was formulated and signed, recognising Abdullah as Sultan, and getting the Chinese to agree to settle their differences in Larut under British arbitration.&lt;ref name="sea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Malaya pp. 80, 124"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Making of Modern South-East Asia: The Western Impact - Economic and Social Change V. 2 By D. J. M. Tate Published by Oxford University Press, 1971 p. 279, 300&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pangkor Engagement ==
The need to restore law and order in Perak gave cause for a new British policy concerning intervention in the affairs of the Malay States which resulted in the [[Treaty of Pangkor]].

On 20 January 1874, the [[Straits Settlements]] governor Sir Andrew Clarke convened a meeting aboard the H. M. S. Pluto anchored off Pangkor island. Documents were signed aboard the ship The Pluto at Pangkor Island to settle the Chinese dispute, clear the Sultan succession dispute and pave the way for the acceptance of British [[Resident (title)|Residency]] - [[Tristam Speedy|Captain Speedy]] was appointed to administer Larut as assistant to the British Resident. Abdullah was recognised as Sultan by the British and was to be installed on the throne of Perak in preference to his rival, Sultan Ismail.

In actuality there were two distinctive agreements made. The primary agreement was intended to ensure an end to the fighting between Ghee Hin and [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] and pave the way for peaceful coexistence in future. The second, to settle the issue of succession in Perak.&lt;ref&gt;Chronology of World History: A Calendar of Principal Events from 3000 BC to AD 1973 By Greville Stewart Parker Freeman-Grenville Published by Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1975; p. 537&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The New Encyclopædia Britannica p. 855"&gt;The New Encyclopædia Britannica: ready reference and index (10 v.)

Tate in The Making of Modern South-East Asia says of these that "the first one, which had been ready for over a week prior to the signing, concerned Larut and provided for a settlement between the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] and Ghee Ghin which both sides respected and carried out satisfactorily. The second (more recently drafted) agreement concerned the succession dispute around the Perak throne and was unsatisfactory from the very beginning."

=== Chinese Engagement ===
Chung, Keng Quee was one of the two main signatories to the treaty known as the [[Pangkor Engagement]] ([[s:Pangkor Engagement|copy of treaty]]) entered into aboard the H.M.S. Pluto at [[Pangkor Island]] by twenty-six headmen of the Chinese Secret Societies. Chung, Keng Quee and Chin, Ah Yam, leaders of the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] and Ghee Hin, respectively, were ennobled by the British with the title of Kapitan China (leader of the Chinese community) and the town of Larut was renamed [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]] ("太平" in Chinese, meaning "everlasting peace") as a confirmation of the new state of truce.&lt;ref name="The New Encyclopædia Britannica p. 855"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica p. 113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Protected Malay States p. 181"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Malaya, A.D pp. 157, 301"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Branch p. 21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parliamentary Paper C pp. 83-84"/&gt;

=== Malay Engagement ===
There were three possibilities for the Perak throne and of these only one was present at the meeting - Abdullah. Sultan Ismail who was the crowned ruler, had refused to attend. The British did not appear to know of the existence of the third possible claimant, Raja Yusof, who was naturally not invited.

The agreement that was signed recognised Abdullah as Sultan giving Ismail the status of Sultan Muda, and provided for a British officer called Resident whose advice must be asked and acted upon on all questions other than those touching on Malay Religion and Custom. Ngah Ibrahim's position in Larut as granted by Sultan Ja'afar and confirmed by Sultan Ali was recognised.

However, as far as the chiefs of Perak (who were not present) were concerned (with this agreement made between the British and Abdullah or the British's recognition of Abdullah as Sultan) - the issue of succession was settled three years earlier with the election of Sultan Ismail. To these Chiefs the British may have proclaimed Abdullah Sultan but his accession was not valid in their eyes and indeed in Malay eyes if he did not hold the (royal) regalia which was at that time in the hands of Sultan Ismail, all attempts at recovering these from him having failed.

== Pacification Commission ==
Three days afterwards, Chung, Keng Quee was appointed a member of [[Commission for the Pacification of Larut]] also comprising [[Samuel Dunlop|Captain S. Dunlop]], [[John Frederick Adolphus McNair]], [[Frank Swettenham]], [[William A. Pickering|W. A. Pickering]] and Chin Seng Yam, whose terms of reference, among others, was to arrange for an amicable settlement relating to the Larut tin mines. The Commissioners after due investigation and deliberation decided to hand the mines in [[Klian Pauh]] ([[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]]) over to the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai Sans]] and the mines in [[Klian Bharu]] ([[Kamunting]]) to the Ghee Hins.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Frank Swettenham's Malayan Journals, 1874-1876&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Short History of Malaya by Gerald Percy Dartford, Malaya, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Secret Societies in Malaya: A Survey of the Triad Society from 1800 to 1900 By Leon Comber Published by Published for the Association for Asian Studies by J.J.

== Perak Council ==
Sir [[Hugh Low]] established the Perak State Council in 1877. Kapitan Chung, Keng Quee was appointed a member of the State Council of Perak (there were six members of the council, four Malays and two Chinese) which held its first meeting at Kuala Kangsar on 10 September 1877. The other members of the Council present were Raja Yussof (the Raja Muda), Sir Hugh Low (Resident), Captain Tristram Speedy (Assistant Resident), Raja Dris', Orang Kaya Temenggong, and Kapitan Chin Seng yam, Che Karim of Selama being absent.&lt;ref&gt;Papers on Malayan History: Papers Submitted By K. G. Tregonning Published by Journal South-East Asian History 1961&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese in Malaya, Victor Purcell.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[magnanimity]] is manifestly clear from the Council Minutes of Perak in "Papers on Malay Subjects" by [[Richard James Wilkinson]], F. M. S. (Federation of Malay States) Government Press, [[Kuala Lumpur]], 1908. He was the first of three generations to serve on the Council, his son [[Chung Thye Phin]] and his grandson [[Chung Kok Ming]] following in his footsteps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysinchew.com/node/2386 Taxing The Chinese, Sinchew Newspaper 29 Oct 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anecdotes ==
* Chung Keng Kwee, when reminded of the Larut Wars by an inquiring visitor, dismissed the subject with an expression of distaste - 'Banyak rugi!' (meaning 'Big loss!) -- see The Protected Malay States: 1874-1895.
* Chung Keng Quee and Chin Seng Yam (Chin Ah Yam) having made peace with each other became fast friends, going so far as to have Ah Yam become the Ch' Yeh or godfather of Keng Quee's fourth son, Chung Thye Phin.

== Sir Hugh Low's letter of vindication ==
The September 1891 issue of Harpers's New Monthly Magazine (Volume 83, Issue 489) carried an article on Chinese Secret Societies and credited Chung Keng Quee with wealth amounting to two million Sterling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unz.com/print/Harpers-1891sep-00595/ Chinese Secret Societies by Frederick Boyle, published in Harper's New Monthly Magazine Volume 83, Issue 489, September 1891]&lt;/ref&gt; The article also stated that Chung, Keng Quee was tried for murder an accusation that was refuted following the publication of a [[s:Hugh Low Vindicates Ah Quee|letter to the editor from Sir Hugh Low, British Resident at Perak, in the December issue (Volume 84, Issue 499) of the same magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Hugh Low Vindicates Ah Quee|Hugh Low Vindicates Ah Quee]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his letter, Sir Hugh refers to Chung, Keng Quee as "my friend Captain Chang Ah Kwi, of Perak" and "my old friend" and urges the editor to take steps to correct the inaccuracies published earlier which he says do great injustice to his friend.

Sir [[Hugh Low]] acknowledged that Chung, Keng Quee was leader of the "Go Kwan faction" in the disturbances that preceded the British intervention under Sir Andrew Clarke, in 1874. He also acknowledged that long after that time when Chung, Keng Quee visited China he was accused of piracy by his rivals in the tin mining business and while he was initially arrested and brought before the mandarins in Canton he was triumphantly acquitted of the charge.

Sir Hugh goes on to state categorically that "Captain Ah Kwi" who was at that time a long-standing member of the State Council, had never ever been "arrested on criminal charges where British influence prevailed", and had in fact from the very beginning "been a strenuous supporter of the settlement of the State of Perak".

The insertion ended with an apology from the author, [[Frederick Boyle]], to the editor of Harper's Magazine.

The relationship between Sir Hugh Low and Chung Keng Quee goes all the way back to Sir Hugh's arrival in Perak. At that time Chung Keng Quee was getting frustrated with the management of the revenue farm that had been given over to him and it was Sir Hugh Low who, as he recalls in his journal "laughed him out of the nonsense about giving up the farm".&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Low Journal Entry 15 May 1877&lt;/ref&gt;

The two of them had many long and frank discussions about the mining business in general as well as revenue farming and the system of "advancers". On 15 May 1877 in a casual meeting between the two, Chung Keng Quee advocated the granting of land leases for the mines for periods of 21 years arguing that this would make it easier for miners to raise money. On 11 September the same year, Sir Hugh Low made this so.&lt;ref&gt;PCM, 11 September 1877&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Malay States, 1877-1895: Political Change and Social Policy By Philip Fook Seng Loh Published by Oxford University Press, 1969; p. 111, 214, 215&lt;/ref&gt;

For Sir Hugh Low, Chung Keng Quee represented a stabilising factor in mining communities that had yet to settle down following the Larut Wars. His was the voice of reason, admonishing the towkays who had stirred up a riot in 1879 and it was a voice that Sir Hugh trusted and backed up.

==Business interests==
Chung Keng Quee was involved in many different businesses but he was first and foremost a tin man. Not only did he help his sons start out in the business, he was apt to support others as well. Between 1884 and 1889 Chung Keng Quee sublet a part the land granted to him for his mining activities to a young man starting out in the business, [[Foo Choo Choon]].&lt;ref&gt;The Mining Magazine: For Minerals Industry Management Worldwide Published by Mining Publications, 1909; Vols. 1 (September 1909) - 145 (December 1981) filmed with: Mining journal -v.297 (1981) University Microfilms International catalog.; p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tin mining ===
By 1879 there were 80 mines in operation in Larut, owned by 40 firms, with an average of nearly 86 men per mine. The largest mine of all in the country was owned by the Kong Loon Kongsi, in Kamunting, directed by Chung Keng Quee&lt;ref&gt;The Malayan Tin Industry to 1914: With Special Reference to the States of Perak, Selangor, Negri, Sembilan, and Pahang By Lin Ken Wong Published by Published for the Association for Asian Studies by the University of Arizona Press, 1965; p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; whom Doyle in Mining In Larut describes as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"an enterprising Chinese gentleman whose appreciation of European appliances is envinced by a centrifugal pump and engine, in supersession of the cumbrous and comparatively useless, Chinese water-wheel."''&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. By Malayan Branch, Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland Malayan Branch, Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland Published by The Branch, 1959; p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tin Mining in Larut By Patrick Doyle Published by Spon, 1879; pp. 7, 29, 30&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Kong Loon mine employed 300 coolies, more than any other mine at that time.  Chung, Keng Quee was a wealthy miner who (circa 1889 - 1895) was granted big mining concessions including {{convert|1000|acres|0|abbr=on}} (4&amp;nbsp;km²) in Kinta.&lt;ref&gt;"Generations: The Story of Batu Gajah" By Ho, Tak Ming (Published 2005 by Ho, Tak Ming {{ISBN|983-40556-5-X}}; (page 105).&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1887 Chung Keng Quee was the largest tin producer in Perak accounting for almost 29,000 pikuls or 1,700 tons out of a total state output of about 220,000 pikuls or about 13,000 tons—more than what all the foreign mines put together could produce.&lt;ref&gt;The Development of the Tin Mining Industry of Malaya By Yat Hoong Yip Published by University of Malaya Press, 1969 p. 97, 427&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1890s Chung Keng Quee was reported to own some of the finest tin mines in Sorakai (Kinta) and Kota (Larut).&lt;ref&gt;The Perak Government Gazette 1891 4:26 p 764; Report on the Larut District by Inspector of Mines in the Perak Government Gazette 1892 5:22 p 592&lt;/ref&gt; The Government of India sanctioned the grant of a large concession in Mergui for him to prospect for tin. According to the Calcutta Correspondent of The Times, this was "the first attempt to encourage, on a large scale, the mining industry in Mergui."&lt;ref&gt;24 March 1892, No 1169 Vol 45, Published in Nature A Weekly Illustrated Journal of Science Volume XLV November 1891 to April 1892 By Norman Lockyer, Nature Publishing Group Published by Nature Publishing Group, 1892, Macmillan Journals, 1892 p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mergui or Myeik is a city in Tanintharyi Division in Myanmar (Burma), located in the extreme south of the country.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Coast of Tennasserim by E.

According to the Ipoh Echo Chung Keng Quee owned the largest alluvial tin mine in the world, the Kwong Lee Mine, which employed 5,000 mining coolies.&lt;ref name="gator791.hostgator.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gator791.hostgator.com/~ipohecho/pdf/48.pdf |title=The Richest Chinaman In The World by Ho Tak Ming, IPOH eCHO April 16 - 30, 2008 |access-date=27 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712221221/http://gator791.hostgator.com/~ipohecho/pdf/48.pdf |archive-date=12 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser reported, "The largest mine in Perak is aboiut to be closed, the produce having become too limited to be payable. This is the Kwong Lee mine of Kota, the property of Captain Ah Kwi. This excavation has been a show place for some time, and has been visited by many persons out of curiosity because of the large scale on which it has been carried on. It was feared, some few months back, that the mine would give out, and a number of the men employed were discharged. Since then, instead of improving, the wash has diminished in value, and the owner is obliged to relinquish it. It paid remarkably well at one time."&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 11 May 1896, Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Innovation and leadership ===
Chung Keng Quee was the first miner to experiment with hydraulic machinery. He was a progressive miner, farsighted and innovative and this together with his close relationship with Sir Hugh Low helped spur on the economic development of the territory.&lt;ref name="stokes"&gt;Mines and Minerals of the British Empire; Being a Description of the Historical, Physical, &amp; Industrial Features of the Principal Centres of Mineral Production in the British Dominions Beyond The Seas By Ralph S. G. Stokes Published by READ BOOKS, 1908; {{ISBN|978-1-4086-2839-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878 on a visit to his mines at Larut, Sir [[William Cleaver Francis Robinson]] the Governor of the Straits Settlements (1877–1879), was impressed to see a steam pump, installed by the Perak Government at Chung Keng Quee's request on the undertaking that if successful it would be taken over and rented by the mine.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson Secretary of State, No 78 of 26 March 1878&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Hugh Low introduced the portable steam pump for draining mines in the protected states in 1878 by first demonstrating its usefulness in Chung Keng Quee's mines. Convinced by the practical results of a real demonstration, owners of large mines in Perak, Selangor and Sungei Ujong soon had similar pumps installed, overcoming the periodic problem of flooding that used to bring work at the mines to a virtual standstill.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Peninsular Malays with Chapters on Perak &amp; Selangor.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revenue farming ===
By 1888 he held the General Farm (taxes upon gambling, spirits and pawnbroking) of Kuala Kangsar, the North and South Larut Coast Farm and the Opium Farm of Lower Perak. In 1890 he obtained the Penang Opium Farm.&lt;ref&gt;A social history of the Chinese in Singapore and Malaya, 1800-1911 by Patrick Guinness, published by the Oxford University Press, 1986, PP 262&lt;/ref&gt; By 1891 he had the Kinta General Farm and the General Farm and Opium Duty Farm of Kuala Kangsar and in 1895 he had the General Farm of Perak and the Coast and Opium Farms of Lower Perak. He acquired the Kinta General Farm in August 1890 at a considerably reduced price.&lt;ref&gt;The Perak Government Gazette 1888, Taiping 1889 pp 93, 106; The Perak Government Gazette 1891, Taiping 1892 p 1166; The Perak Government Gazette 1894, Taiping 1895; Kinta Monthly Letter for August 1890 in The Perak Government Gazette 1890 3:26 p 593.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889, after the Pangkor settlement of 1874, Sir Hugh Low, British Resident at Perak, gave over most of the Larut and Kurau [[opium]], gambling, spirits, pawnbroking and tobacco farms to Chung, Keng Quee and his business partner, Khoo, Thean Teik. In Penang, Chung, Keng Quee and his friends and relatives made up one of three similar syndicate groups that dominated the [[Opium]] Farms there.

Chung Keng Quee apart from being a man of vision was also a great risk-taker. Sir Hugh Low in his own notes describing negotiations over the leasing out of the Perak revenue farms compares Chung Keng Quee and Khoo Thian Teik. Chung Keng Quee had told him that he needed five thousand more coolies to make the venture successful while Khoo Thian Teik had talked of two or three hundred more.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Peninsular Malays with Chapters on Perak &amp; Selangor&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did he get his coolies from China, Ah Quee also employed coolies from India.&lt;ref&gt;Ah Quee (the " Capitan Cheena," before adverted to, p. 7), being desirous of
extending his mining operations, resolved upon employing Klings (natives of ..., vide Tin Mining in Larut By Patrick Doyle Published by Spon, 1879; p. 7, 29, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

His exceptional management of the revenue farms entrusted to him helped bring fresh capital into Perak and helped him to become, by 1886, the largest financier in Larut.

While he obviously was making a lot of money from revenue farming, in 1897 Sir Hugh Low, then the Resident, negotiated with Chung, Keng Quee, who was at that time owner of the largest mine in the country and probably the most influential financier of tin mines in the country, to abolish the supply of opium in return for greater protection of tin mine employers from their absconding coolies and for longer working hours.

From 1880 to 1897, in partnership with the Tan, Yeoh, Lim, Cheah, and Khoo families, Chung Keng Quee invested over $2.8 million to dominate all the revenue farms from upper to lower Perak.&lt;ref name="Yeetuan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Penang Gazette and Straits Chronicle, 31 October 1879, p. 4; 10 October 1891, p. 5; 30 October 1894, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tobacco farming ===
He had many tobacco farms in several areas in Perak, including Larut, Kuala Kangsar, Kerian and Selama.&lt;ref&gt;66 Usahawan Malaysia by Mohamad Ashadi bin Mohd Zaini, published by PTS Professional, {{ISBN|978-983-3376-62-9}}, Page 162&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Chen Eok he held the Tobacco farms in Larut and Larut Coast between 1883 and 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Triad societies: western accounts of the history, sociology and linguistics ... By Kingsley Bolton, Christopher Hutton, Pg 344&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reputation for business success ===
Chung Keng Quee formed close relationships with the many British Residents of Perak and built a reputation for making mining operations a success. E. W. Birch (Ernest Woodford Birch), seventh British Resident to Perak, left in February 1897 to take up the post of Acting British Resident, Negeri Sembilan and on 15 March 1897, while paying visits of inspection to various parts of the Negri Sembilan, recorded in his papers "I wish we could induce Captain Ah Kwi, of Perak, to enter Lukut and Labu" (The Selangor Journal: Jottings Past and Present, Vol V, 1897 Page 254).

== Chung Keng Quee and Khoo Thean Teik ==
Chung Keng Quee and [[Khoo Thean Teik]] were connected both politically and commercially, the politics of the day being commercially motivated in any case. Apart from the monopolies for tobacco, liquor, opium and gambling revenue farming in Perak that these two jointly obtained from Sir [[Hugh Low]], British Resident at Perak in 1889, they were both heads of their respective secret societies which were allied against their common foe, the Ghee Hin. While Chung, Keng Quee was head of the Hai San his ally Khoo, Thean Teik was head of the Tua Pek Kong or Kien Tek Society. Chung, Keng Quee and Khoo, Thean Teik together represented the allied Haisan-Khianteik group of Perak Hakkas and Penang Hockiens.

Both Chung and Khoo were in the business of procuring, supplying or employing coolies. Khoo, Thean Teik aided by Koh, Seang Thye on one occasion supplied $60,000 in goods, money and ammunition to Chung, Keng Quee and Tan, Yit Hoon for their mining activities and for their military activities against the Ghee Hin in return for seven-tenths of the percentage of the tin they produced.&lt;ref name="Yeetuan"&gt;[http://csds.anu.edu.au/volume_1_2007/Wong.pdf The Big Five Hokkien Families in Penang, 1830s–1890s ©2007 Yeetuan Wong Chinese Southern Diaspora Studies, Volume 1, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719013321/http://csds.anu.edu.au/volume_1_2007/Wong.pdf |date=19 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khoo Kay Kim, The Western Malay States 1850–1873: the Effects of Commercial Development on Malay Politics, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong Choon San, A Gallery of Chinese Kapitans (Singapore: Ministry of Culture, 963), pp. 77, 78, 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cases heard and determined in her Majesty's Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements, Somerset: Legal Library (Publishing) Services, vol.4 (1885/1890), pp. 136-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chung Keng Quee and Foo Choo Choon ==
Foo Choo Choon originally worked for Chung Keng Kwee in his Lahat mining concession.&lt;ref&gt;The Richest Chinaman in the World by IpohWorld, Ipoh Echo, HKT&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to marry a niece of Chung Keng Quee.

== The ''Sri Sarawak'' ==
Chung Keng Quee had a screw steamer, the ''Sri Sarawak'', that plied a route between the Larut river and Penang. This vessel is mentioned in various documents of the time including personal journals. Emily Sadka in the Journal of Sir Hugh Low, Perak, 1877, remarks about an unflattering description of the craft given in Isabella Bird's The Golden Chersonese (and the way thither) p 277 but the unflattering part of Bird's description that Sadka referred to was actually about the pier and not the boat. What Bird said about the ''Sri Sarawak'' was that it is "a small but very useful Chinese trading steamer".

== Personality ==
Chung Keng Quee was a big-hearted philanthropist and in his lifetime his donations, subscriptions and sponsorships benefited many individuals and groups. Together with [[Cheong Fatt Tze]], [[Chang Yu Nan]], [[Cheah Choon Seng]] and [[Tye Kee Yoon]], he was part of a group referred to as The Five Great Sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;Monographs on Malay subjects, Volumes 61-63, MBRAS, Page 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Penang postcard collection 1899-1930s By Salma Nasution Khoo, Malcolm Wade&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Streets of George Town Penang - Page 37 - by Su Nin Khoo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Penang Sketchbook - Page 95 - by Kon Yit Chin, Chen Voon Fee&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lau-Fong Mak,  who says he "is indisputably the century's biggest patron of all," Chung Keng Quee alone accounted for about 92% of the charitable contributions made by the sole three members of the Cantonese-Hakka economic elite between the years 1850 and 1910.&lt;ref name="MAK Lau-Fong 1987"&gt;Chinese Subcommunal Elites in 19th-Century Penang by MAK Lau-Fong (Department of Sociology, National University of Singapore, Singapore 0511) published in Southeast Asian Studies, Vol. 25, No.2, September 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supporting education ===
==== Support for poor scholars in China ====
In the absence of Malayan citizenship laws during that time, [[Kapitan Cina|Kapitan]] Chung, Keng Quee occasionally visited his home village in [[China]]. In commemoration of the birthday of his mother, Madam Lai, Chung, Keng Quee founded and endowed a big scholarship fund for poor Chinese scholars preparing themselves for the time-honoured civil service examinations. He erected a memorial arch (Men fang) for his mother, Madam Lai, in 1886.

==== Five Luck Villa: school for all Chinese dialect groups ====
Chung Keng Quee was a principal director of Ng Fook Hsu Yin (Wufu School) in Penang. In 1893, Chung, Keng Quee, already a millionaire, built a Chinese school in Penang, for all the Chinese children irrespective of their dialects. Having bought over the property in Church Street where the school (the Five Luck Villa also called Goh Hock Tong, Ng Fook Tong and the United Association of Cantonese Districts) was originally located, Chung Keng Quee identified a new site for the school in Chulia Street.&lt;ref&gt;'Bincheng Wufu Shuyuan yu Zheng Jinggui'（槟城五福书院与郑景贵） Sin Ping Jit Poh（星槟日报）, 3 October 1951&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The politics of Chinese education in Malaya, 1945-1961 (South-East Asian historical monographs) By Liok Ee Tan, Published by Oxford University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-983-56-0013-5}}, 352 pages&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese in Malaysia (South-East Asian social science monographs) by Kam Hing Lee &amp; Chee Beng Tan (Editors), Published by Oxford University Press, 2000, {{ISBN|978-983-56-0056-2}}, 418 pages&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Confucian Revival Movement in Singapore and Malaya, 1899-1911, by Yen Ching-Hwang © 1976 Department of History, National University of Singapore&lt;/ref&gt;

The board membership was made up of four secretaries and 209 assistant secretaries. Chung Keng Quee was its chief secretary. There were nearly 1,300 donors who gave between 5760 and 1 yuan. The largest amount, as well as the building site were donated by Chung Keng Quee.&lt;ref name="MAK Lau-Fong 1987"/&gt; On top of his donations, Chung Keng Quee also gave a loan of 20,000 yuan towards the construction of the new building. The Ch'ien-i bank-society was set up by leading members of the community for this purpose and members of the society invested at least 30 cents a month for 36 months and the interest on these deposits as on the capital were used to repay the Chung Keng Quee's loan. 175 people deposited amounts from 816 yuan (from Chung Keng Quee himself) to 15 yuan. The new building was completed in 1898.

==== [[St. Xavier's Institution]] ====
In 1895, the new double-storey building he had erected together with Gan Hong Kee, and Lim Ah Kye (the latter two posthumously), was completed and its inauguration took place on Thursday 28 November at 1.30pm, where Chung Keng Quee and the Honourable Resident Councillor, Henry Trotter, were guests of honour.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 27 November 1895, Page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Brother's School. The Straits Times, 30 November 1895, Page 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 7 December 1895, Page 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[St. Xavier's Institution#Newspaper Reports From 1859|St. Xavier's Institution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chong Wen She Institute ====
In March 1901, just months before he died, Chung, Keng Quee and several other members of the Hakka Associations in Penang established an Educational Institution called Chong Wen She (崇文社). The Educational Institution organised campaigns to encourage the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] in Penang to respect education. The motto of the campaigns was "Jing Xi Zi Zhi" or to respect the words written on the paper. The Educational Institution established a free of charge private school for all the children irrespective of their dialects. The school also enrolled the locally born Chinese children with the intention of giving them a classical education so that they would not forget about their roots.&lt;ref&gt;Two Hundred Years of the Hakkas in Penang; The others were [[Leong Fee]] (Liang P'i Joo/Liang Bi Ru|梁碧如), [[Foo Choo Choon]] (Hu Zi Chun|)胡子春), [[Tye Kee Yoon]] (Dai Xin Ran|戴欣然), Rao Fu Chang (饒芙裳), Xiong Yu Shan (熊玉珊), Wen Zong Jin (溫宗錦), Lin Shi An (林世安), Li Feng Bao (李鳳苞), Li Mu San (李慕參), Zhang Xian Chen (張顯宸) and Yang Shao Fen (楊少芬).&lt;/ref&gt;

Chung Keng Quee's donation of 150 yuan for the restoration of the temple is inscribed in a stone set up on the occasion, dated 1865 or early 1866 and kept at the Tua Pek Kong Temple in King Street, Penang, which the Tanjung Tokong temple is connected to. The lowest amount recorded is two yuan and the highest is 250 yuan. His donation of 30 yuan is inscribed in a stone (1868) set up by board members of the King Street Tua Pek kong Temple to commemorate the gilding and varnishing of the temple. On the stone he is referred to as Chou T'ung, First Class Assistant Department Magistrate.&lt;ref&gt;Rank 6B; Brunnert 851A&lt;/ref&gt; Two other donors are called Kung-yuan, Senior Licentiate.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnert 629A&lt;/ref&gt;

A donation of land to the cemetery by Chung Keng Quee and his daughter Kang Neoh&lt;ref name="Penang 2007, page 51"/&gt; (also spelt Keng-niang and Huang Jiang) is recorded in one of two similar stones. One of a set of three stone inscriptions dated 1901 records the 600 yuan donation of Chung Keng Quee (made during the period from 1898 to 1900) as well as the position of secretary held under the name of Hye Kee Chan (Hai-chi chan 海记栈), his company.

==== [[Kek Lok Si]] Temple/Pagoda, Penang ====
At Kek Lok Si (Chi-lo Ssu/Jili Si), the Temple of Supreme Happiness, on an inscription in stone dated 1906 listing the particulars of donors, it is recorded that Cheng Ssu-wen (Chung Keng Quee) with honorary second rank, donated 6,000 yuan, the 5th largest donation. Another stone inscription, this one dated 1907 recording the origin and development of the temple, shows that Cheng Ssu-wen (Chung Keng Quee) was one of the six senior secretaries of the temple at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Subcommunal Elites in 19th-Century Penang by MAK Lau-Fong (Department of Sociology, National University of Singapore, Singapore 0511) published in Southeast Asian Studies, Vol. 25, No.2, September 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franke, Chinese Epigraphic Materials in Malaysia.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the five wealthy patrons from Penang whom Beow Lian convinced (between 1887 and 1891) to form the core support for the construction of the temple, after having selected the site in Ayer Itam.

=== Support for European engineers In Penang ===
The Engineers' Institute was probably the first of its kind in the country. Opened for the recreation and general use of the engineers who formed a large part of the European community (30%). Originally the institute occupied rooms in Beach Street but later moved to a beautiful double storey building presented by the Capitan Chung Kheng Kwi at the junction of Leith Street and Farquhar Street. On 5 March 1888, an institute was opened for the recreation and general convenience of [[Europe]]an mechanical engineers. For some time membership was confined exclusively to engineers and mechanics but was so popular that before long the regulations were altered so as to include deck officers, and certain longshoremen. The growth and development of the institute proceeded so rapidly that larger buildings were soon required, and, by arrangement with Kapitan Chung, Keng Quee, a new two storey headquarters building was erected at the junction of Leith and Farquhar streets. Upon the staircase was a beautiful stained-glass window presented by Chung, Keng Quee, and bearing the inscription, "Erected by Captain Cheng Kheng Kwi, Perak and Pinang, 1901". Near at hand was a portrait of the donor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penang.gov.my/index.php?ch=16&amp;pg=99&amp;ac=15&amp;lang=eng&amp;format= Engineer's Institute, Penang State Government Official Portal, Last updated: 22/02/2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Property donations ===
When the Lim Ancestral Temple building on Beach Street was completed in 1866, the Kew Leong Tong (Hall of Nine Dragons) Lim Kongsi, one of the three Lim Clan Associations in [[Penang]], moved its office there. The address was 234 Beach Street. Later, Ah Quee Street was established when Kapitan Chung, Keng Quee donated his Beach Street shophouse to be demolished to create the street that bears his name. Ah Quee Street runs beside 164 Beach Street which also happens to be the longest shophouse in Penang. (Source: Timothy Tye)

=== Recognition and reward by the Qing Imperial Government, China ===
For his many acts of greatness the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] [[Qing dynasty]] Imperial government in 1894 conferred on him the title of "Mandarin, Second Rank" retrospectively for three generations. This meant that Kapitan Chung, Keng Quee, his father, Chung, Hsing Fah, and his grandfather, Chung, Tung Lin, the last two posthumously, simultaneously became Mandarins of the Second Rank. In line with his elevation he then adopted the fancy name of "Sheng Chih".

== Townhouse and temple on Church Street ==
[[File:Pinang Peranakan Mansion.JPG|thumb|[[Pinang Peranakan Mansion]], or Hye Kee Chan]]

In Georgetown, Penang Chung, Keng Quee became known as the city's great connoisseur of architecture.

In 1893, Chung, Keng Quee acquired two adjacent properties along Church Street on Penang Island. The first was the former headquarters of the Ghee Hin - the Hai San had ousted them in the 1870s. The second was a Chinese school, the Goh Hock Tong (or Ng Fook Tong in Cantonese) meaning Five Luck Villa. He offered the school an alternative site in Chulia Street, where a new building was completed in 1898.

Chung, Keng Quee converted the former Ghee Hin headquarters into his townhouse and office and named this, [[Pinang Peranakan Mansion|Hye Kee Chan]] (海记栈), or Sea Remembrance Store. It has interior fittings including Victorian cast iron columns from [http://glasgowsculpture.com/pg_biography.php?sub=macfarlane_w-co Walter Macfarlane &amp; Co of Glasgow (also known as The Saracen Foundry]).

Macfarlane was also responsible for the beautiful iron gates and fencing of the former Five Luck Villa building which was converted into a personal temple (Shen-chih hsueh-shu where Shen-chih was his fancy name and hsueh-shu means a traditional-style private family school).

In the temple stands a life-size bronze statue of Chung Keng Quee. The statue was commissioned by the Engineers' Institute that he had generously donated a new building to. It was created by [[Benjamin Creswick]] and a facsimile of it was shown at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;'The Late Chung Keng Quee (listed as The Late Cheng Keng Lei)', Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851-1951, University of Glasgow History of Art and HATII, online database 2011 [http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/object.php?id=msib4_1203077132, accessed 6 September 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; On the base of the statue will be found the signature of Benjamin Creswick, and an imprint, [[Broad and Sons]], the bronze founders in Birmingham who cast the statue.&lt;ref&gt;Email from Annie Creswick Dawson&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Hye Kee Chan is more commonly known as the [[Pinang Peranakan Mansion]]. Open to the public, it serves as a museum showcasing the lifestyle, customs and traditions of the Peranakans or Straits Chinese - an example of [[adaptive reuse]].

=== Generation names and etymology ===
Chung Keng Quee's generational name was "Keng" meaning "picture" or "landscape". The generation after him, "Thye" means "big" or "large" or "great". The next generation "Kok" means "country" or "land" and i.e. to do with the geography of a place. The generation after that, "choong" is the same word as "China". And the generation after that "Chung" means "originating from" or "coming from". When written out and read from the last generation, "Chung", to the first generation, "Keng", it reads, 从中國大景 : "Coming from China, a big picture", or "From China comes a great visionary".&lt;ref&gt;Soomay Yen&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Kapitan China Chung Keng Quee died at the age of 74 on 13 December 1901 after a brief illness of only a few days.

The Perak Administrative Report for 1901:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The death of Captain Cheang Keng Kwi is announced. He held the title for 30 years. It is no longer required and is allowed to lapse as the [[Chinese Protectorate|Protector (of Chinese)]] working under the Federal Secretary for Chinese Affairs is the best intermediary between the Government and the Chinese."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Malay Mail Monday 16 December 1901:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The late Capitan China of Perak is said to have died worth $10,000,000."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Perak Pioneer &amp; Native States Advertiser Vol VII Taiping Saturday 14 December 1901:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"By the death of Capitan Chang Keng Kwi, which occurred at his residence in Penang on Thursday night, one of the most picturesque figures in the history of Malaysia has been removed."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Reported net worth ===
He made his fortune early in his life in the tin mines and revenue farms of Perak, and while lost it all during the Larut Wars, he rebuilt his empire and died a rich man. At the time of his death:
* he had held the Perak Revenue Farms for twelve years
* he owned ten mines employing an aggregate of 1,000 coolies
* his property in Hong Kong was estimated at $10,000,000
* his property in Beach Street, Penang was valued at $1,500,000

According to the Ipoh Echo he was the richest man in the Federated Malay States and, when he died, the whole of his estate in Penang alone was worth seven million Straits dollars.&lt;ref name="gator791.hostgator.com"/&gt; The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 13 December 1901, Page 2&lt;/ref&gt; wrote, "The property of the late Cheang Keng Kwi is valued at ten millions," and reported that he was the largest tin miner in the Peninsula and owned a tenth part of Georgetown Penang in addition to property in Perak and Hong Kong at the time of his death.

=== Final acts of charity ===
He was a generous man given to acts of charity and besides Chinese educational institutions he had given money to the [[Penang Free School|Free School]] ($12,000) and the [[St. Xavier's Institution|Brother's School]] ($6,000).&lt;ref&gt;China Mail (Hong Kong), Dec 1901&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funerary ===
He left behind a wife, ten sons and five daughters, 20 grandchildren, and four great grandchildren.

Chung, Keng Quee was buried in the Chung Family Burial Plot in Mount Erskine purchased beforehand by himself and his daughter Chung, Kang Neoh.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Chinese Epigraphic Materials in Malaysia (Volume 2) - collected, annotated, and edited by Wolfgang Frankie and Chen Tieh Fan published 1985 by University of Malaya Press, {{ISBN|967-9940-00-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His tomb is dated 1898. It was named "Region of Long Life", and Franke (Chinese Epigraphy. ..) believed that it was built before the great man died and was probably set up on the occasion of the demise of the wife who pre-deceased him. In his book published in 1985 Franke declared it was "the largest Chinese tomb in the whole of Malaysia. ..appropriate only to members of the imperial family or to the highest officials" and incorporating four man-sized statues (the only tomb in Malaysia with statues of this kind) "called weng-chung. .. ...permitted only for the tombs of officials of the first rank."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

His headstone bears the inscription:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Kapitan of Perak, Chung Keng Quee from Tseng-ch'eng, appointed by Imperial patent of the Ch'ing Emperor as Tzu-cheng ta-fu,&lt;ref&gt;Rank 2A; see Brunnert, 1912, No. 945&lt;/ref&gt; rewarded with the Peacock Feather, and Expectant Intendant of a Circuit of the fourth rank,&lt;ref&gt;Brunnert, 1912, Nos. 838 and 844A&lt;/ref&gt; and of his wife Lady Cheng, nee Ch'en, with the personal name Yii-yin and the posthumous name Chao-i appointed by Imperial patent as Third Rank Shu-jen,&lt;ref&gt;Brunnert, 1912, No. 945&lt;/ref&gt; set up by nine sons, six daughters, twelve grandsons, and six granddaughters of the deceased."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lee, Eng Kew (Ah Kew The Digger) named his book about [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]] and its historical figures, Yi Guo (which literally means "to move country"), words derived from the inscriptions on the grave of Chung, Keng Quee.

Although he died in December 1901, he was only laid in his final resting place in 1904. On Sunday 11 May 1902 (almost five months after he left this world), his remains were removed from [[Pinang Peranakan Mansion|Hye Kee Chan]] (29 Church Street) and placed in a temporary vault awaiting his final interment. The funeral procession from home to the family graveyard made up of people on foot and on rickshaws was reported to have been over a mile long and included several hundred Europeans catered to by Messrs [[Sarkies Brother]]s. Security was personally supervised by the CPO of Penang.&lt;ref&gt;The Perak Pioneer, 15 May 1902&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ipoh: When Tin Was King by Ho Tak Ming, published by The Perak Academy, {{ISBN|978-983-42500-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Straits Times&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 16 May 1902, Page 4&lt;/ref&gt; reported that his funeral procession took an hour and a half to pass a fixed point.

== Taiping Lake Gardens ==
One of his mining pools was donated&lt;ref&gt;The Selangor Journal: Jottings Past and Present, Vol II, 1984, Pg 102&lt;/ref&gt; for public use by his son, [[Chung Thye Phin]] and is today the [[Taiping Lake Gardens]].  In 1884, a large area comprising swamps and abandoned mining pools was drained, levelled, planted and fenced for a public garden in Taiping. In 1911, it was considered to be perhaps the most beautiful of any gardens in the then Federated Malay States.&lt;ref&gt;A Design Guide of Public Parks in Malaysia by Jamil Abu Bakar, Published by Penerbit UTM, 2002; {{ISBN|978-983-52-0274-2}}; pp. 87-92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malaysia Edition 18 (illustrated) edited by Francis Dorai, Published by APA Publications, 1987, Page 162&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chung surname ==
* Pinyin Romanisation: [[Zheng (surname)|Zheng4 Zhèng]]
* Chinese Character (Traditional Big5): 鄭
* B5 No.: 7
* Meaning: Serious; Solemn
* Wade–Giles Romanisation/Pronunciation: Cheng4

'''Citrix Receiver''' is the [[client (computing)|client]] component of [[XenDesktop]] and [[XenApp]], developed by [[Citrix Systems]]. It was released initially in 2009.

==Product overview==
Citrix Receiver is the client component of XenDesktop or XenApp.&lt;ref name=Lardinois14&gt;{{cite news |title=Google And Citrix Team Up To Launch A Better Citrix Receiver For Chrome OS|author=Frederic Lardinois|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/21/google-and-citrix-team-up-to-make-chromebooks-more-attractive-to-businesses/ |work=techcrunch.com |date=21 August 2014 | accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devices with Receiver installed are able to access full desktops via XenDesktop or individual applications via XenApp from a centralized host, such as a [[Server (computing)|server]] or [[Cloud computing|cloud infrastructure]].&lt;ref name=Musthaler11&gt;{{cite news |title=Citrix Receiver brings full-fledged desktop apps to smartphones and tablets |first=Linda |last=Musthaler |url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2183702/infrastructure-management/citrix-receiver-brings-full-fledged-desktop-apps-to-smartphones-and-tablet.html

Citrix Receiver is not a standalone product and is included with XenApp and XenDesktop.&lt;ref name=Woods11&gt;{{cite news |title=Citrix expands Receiver support to one billion devices |author=Ben Woods |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/citrix-expands-receiver-support-to-one-billion-devices/ |work=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=May 27, 2011 |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews praised Citrix Receiver's reasonably fast loading time&lt;ref name="Blackwell2010"&gt;{{cite web | last = Blackwell | first = Gerry | title = Review: Citrix Receiver for iPad | work = EnterpriseMobileToday | publisher = QuinStreet Inc | date = July 29, 2010 | url = http://www.enterprisemobiletoday.com/reviews/article.php/3895756/Review-Citrix-Receiver-for-iPad.htm | accessdate = 18 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and flexibility in allowing remote desktop access from many different computer and mobile platforms.&lt;ref name="Battersby15"&gt;{{cite web | last = Battersby| first = Jeffery | title = Citrix Receiver for iPhone | work = [[Macworld]] | publisher = [[IDG]] | date = | url = http://www.macworld.com/article/1142363/citrixreceiver.html | accessdate = 18 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, reviewers also criticized the iPhone version of the software for the difficulty of formatting text and prolonged typing, tasks that normally required a keyboard and mouse.&lt;ref name="Battersby15"/&gt; The iPad version had similar accessibility issues, and the performance of flash applications was very limited.&lt;ref name="Blackwell2010"/&gt; As a remedy, Citrix developed a mouse for iOS devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Broida | first = Rick | title = Citrix to launch iOS-compatible mouse | work = [[CNET]] | publisher = [[CBS Interactive]] | date = May 7, 2015 | url = http://www.cnet.com/news/citrix-to-launch-first-ios-compatible-mouse/ | accessdate = 11 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to Receiver, Citrix had a different client for each of its products.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15879">The '''Cohn process''', developed by [[Edwin Joseph Cohn|Edwin J. Cohn]], is a series of purification steps with the purpose of extracting [[human serum albumin|albumin]] from [[blood plasma]]. The process is based on the differential [[solubility]] of albumin and other plasma proteins based on [[pH]], [[ethanol]] concentration, temperature, ionic strength, and protein concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Kirk -Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 4th edition, vol 11, 990-1021|last=Foster|first=Peter|publisher=|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=990-1021}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="CohnStrong1946"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohn|first1=E. J.|last2=Strong|first2=L. E.|last3=Hughes|first3=W. L.|last4=Mulford|first4=D. J.|last5=Ashworth|first5=J. N.|last6=Melin|first6=M.|last7=Taylor|first7=H. L.|title=Preparation and Properties of Serum and Plasma Proteins. IV. A System for the Separation into Fractions of the Protein and Lipoprotein Components of Biological Tissues and Fluids1a,b,c,d|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=68|issue=3|year=1946|pages=459–475|issn=0002-7863|doi=10.1021/ja01207a034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albumin has the highest solubility and lowest [[isoelectric point]] of all the major plasma proteins. This makes it the final product to be precipitated, or separated from its solution in a solid form. Albumin was an excellent substitute for human plasma in World War Two. When administered to wounded soldiers or other patients with blood loss, it helped expand the volume of blood and led to speedier recovery. Cohn's method was gentle enough that isolated albumin protein retained its biological activity.&lt;ref name="Surgenor"&gt;Surgenor, Douglas. Edwin J. Cohn and the Development of Protein Chemistry. Center for Blood Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process details ==
During the operations, the  ethanol concentration change from zero initially to 40%. The pH decreases from neutral at 7 to more acidic at 4.8 over the course of the fractionation. The temperature starts at room temperature and decreases to &amp;minus;5 degrees Celsius. Initially, the blood is frozen. There are five major fractions. Each fraction ends with a specific precipitate. These precipitates are the separate fractions.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Harris, James R. Blood Separation and Plasma Fractionation. Wiley-Liss. 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Fractions I, II, and III are precipitated out at earlier stages. The conditions of the earlier stages are 8% ethanol, pH 7.2, &amp;minus;3&amp;nbsp;°C, and 5.1% protein for Fraction I; 25% ethanol, pH of 6.9, &amp;minus;5&amp;nbsp;°C, and 3% protein. The albumin remains in the supernatant fraction during the solid/liquid extraction under these conditions. Fraction IV has several unwanted proteins that need to be removed. In order to do this, the conditions are varied in order to precipitate the proteins out. The conditions to precipitate these proteins are raising the ethanol concentration from 18 to 40% and raising the pH from 5.2 to 5.8. Finally, albumin is located in fraction V. The precipitation of albumin is done by reducing the pH to 4.8, which is near the pI of the protein, and maintaining the ethanol concentration to be 40%, with a protein concentration of 1%. Thus, only 1% of the original plasma remains in the fifth fraction.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

However, albumin is lost at each process stage, with roughly 20% of the albumin   lost through [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] stages before fraction V. In order to purify the albumin, there is an extraction with water, and adjustment to 10% ethanol, pH of 4.5 at &amp;minus;3&amp;nbsp;°C. Any precipitate formed here is done so by filtration and is an impurity. These precipitates are discarded. Reprecipitation, or repetition of the precipitation step in order to improve purity, is done so by raising ethanol concentration back to 40% from the extraction stage. The pH is 5.2 and it is conducted at &amp;minus;5&amp;nbsp;°C. Several variations of Cohn fraction were created to account for lower cost and higher yield. Generally, if the yield is high, the purity is lowered, to roughly 85-90%.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; &lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Slide3.gif|right]] --&gt;

== Products other than albumin==
Cohn was able to start the Plasma Fractionation Laboratory after he was given massive funding from the government agencies and the private pharmaceutical companies. This led to the fractionation of human plasma. Human plasma proved to have several useful components other than albumin. Human [[blood plasma fractionation]] yielded [[human serum albumin]], Serum Gamma [[Globulin]], [[Fibrinogen]], [[Thrombin]], and Blood Group Globulins.&lt;ref name="Birnie"&gt;Birnie, G.D. Subcellular components: Preparation and Fractionation. Butterworth. 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;  The fibrinogen and thrombin fractions were further combined during the War  into additional products, including liquid [[Fibrin Sealant]],&lt;ref name="Cohn"&gt;Cohn, E.J. The history of plasma fractionation. In Advances in Military Medicine, Andrus et al. Eds.

In Tissue Glues in Cosmetic Surgery, Saltz &amp; Toriumi Eds., Quality Medical Publishing, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
Gamma Globulins are found in Fractions II and III and proved to be essential in treating measles for soldiers. Gamma globulin also was useful in treatment for polio, but did not have much effect in treating mumps or scarlet fever. Most importantly, the gamma globulins were useful in modifying and preventing infectious hepatitis during the Second World War. It eventually became a treatment for children exposed to this type of hepatitis.&lt;ref name="Birnie"/&gt;

Liquid fibrin sealant was used in treating burn victims, including some from the attack at Pearl Harbor, to attach skin grafts with an increased success rate.&lt;ref name="Cohn"/&gt; It was also found  helpful at re-connecting or anastomosing severed nerves.&lt;ref name="Cohn"/&gt;  Fibrin foam and thrombin were used to control blood vessel oozing especially in liver injuries and near tumors. It also minimized bleeding from large veins as well as dealing with blood vessel malformations within the brain. Fibrin film was used to stop bleeding in various surgical applications, including neurosurgery.&lt;ref name="Cohn"/&gt; However, it was not useful in controlling arterial bleeding.&lt;ref name="Birnie"/&gt;  The first fibrinogen/fibrin based product capable of stopping arterial hemorrhage  was the "Fibrin Sealant Bandage" or "Hemostatic Dressing (HD)" invented by [[Martin MacPhee]] at the American Red Cross in the early 1990s, and tested in collaboration with the U.S. Army.&lt;ref name="pmid9291993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Holcomb JB, Pusateri AE, Hess JR, Hetz SP, Harris RA, Tock BB, Drohan WN, MacPhee MJ | title = Implications of new dry fibrin sealant technology for trauma surgery | journal = Surg.

== Process variations==
The Gerlough method, developed in 1955 improved process economics by reducing the consumption of ethanol. Instead of 40% in certain steps, Gerlough used 20% ethanol for precipitation. This is especially used for Fractions II and III. In addition, Gerlough combined the two fractions with IV into one step to reduce the number of fractionations required. While this method proved less expensive, it was not adopted by industry because of this combination of fractions II, III, and IV, for fear of mixing and high impurities.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;Graham, J.M., Rickwood, D.  Subcellular Fractionation, a Practical Approach. Oxford University Press. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hink method developed in 1957. This method gave higher yields through recovery of some of the plasma proteins discarded in the Fractions of IV. The improved yields, however, balanced by the  lower purities obtained,  within the 85% range.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt;

The Mulford method, akin to the Hink, used the fractions II and III supernatant as the last step before finishing and heat treatment. The method combined fractions IV and V, but in this case, the albumin would not be as pure, although the yields may be higher.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt;

Another variation was developed by Kistler and Nitschmann, to provide a purer form of albumin, even though   offset by lower yields. Similar to Gerlough, the Precipitate A, which is equivalent to Cohn’s Fraction II and III, was done at a lower ethanol concentration of 19%, but the pH, in this case, was also lower to 5.85. Also similar to Gerlough and Mulford, the fraction IV was combined and precipitated at conditions of 40% ethanol, pH of 5.85, and temperature of &amp;minus;8 degrees C. The albumin, which is recovered in fraction V, is recovered in Precipitate C at a pH adjustment to 4.8. Similar to the Cohn Process, the albumin is purified by extraction into water followed by precipitation of the impurities at 10% ethanol, pH 4.6, and &amp;minus;3 degrees C. Akin to the Cohn Process, the precipitate formed here is filtered out and discarded. Then Precipitate C (fraction V) is reprecipitated at pH 5.2 and stored as a paste at &amp;minus;40 degrees C.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt; This process has been more widely accepted because it separates the fractions and makes each stage independent of each other.

Another variation involved a heat ethanol fractionation. It was originally developed to inactivate the hepatitis virus. In this process, recovery of high yield, high purity albumin is the most important goal, while the other plasma proteins are neglected. In order to make sure the albumin does not denature in the heat, there are stabilizers such as sodium octanoate, which allow the albumin to tolerate higher temperatures for long periods. In heat ethanol, the plasma is heat treated at 68 degrees C with sodium octanoate with 9% ethanol at pH of 6.5. This results in improved albumin recovery with yields of 90%, and purities of 100%. It is not nearly as expensive as cold ethanol procedures such as the Cohn Process. One drawback is the presences of new antigens due to possible heat denaturation of the albumin. In addition, the other plasma proteins have practical uses and to neglect them would not be worth it. Finally, the expensive heat treatment vessels offset the lower cost compared to the cold ethanol format that do not need it. For these reasons, several companies haven not adopted this method even though it has the most impressive results. However, one prominent organization that uses it is the German Red Cross.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt;

The latest variation was developed by Hao in 1979. This method is significantly simplified compared to the Cohn Process. Its goal is to create high albumin yields as long as albumin is the sole product. Through a two-stage process, impurities are precipitated directly from fractions II and III supernatant at 42% ethanol, pH 5.8, temperature &amp;minus;5 degrees C, 1.2% protein, and 0.09 ionic strength. Fraction V is precipitated at pH 4.8. Fractions I, II, III, and IV are [[coprecipitation|coprecipitated]] at 40% ethanol, with pH of 5.4 to 7.0, and temperature &amp;minus;3 to &amp;minus;7 degrees C. Fraction V is then precipitated at pH 4.8 and &amp;minus;10 degrees C. The high yields are due to a combination of a simplified process, with lower losses due to coprecipitation, and use of filtration. Higher purities were also achieved at 98% because of the higher ethanol levels, but the yields were lowered with the high purity.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt;

More recent methods involve the use of [[Chromatography in Blood Processing|chromatography]].&lt;ref name="TanakaShigueoka1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tanaka|first1=K.|last2=Shigueoka|first2=E.M.|last3=Sawatani|first3=E.|last4=Dias|first4=G.A.|last5=Arashiro|first5=F.|last6=Campos|first6=T.C.X.B.|last7=Nakao|first7=H.C.|title=Purification of human albumin by the combination of the method of Cohn with liquid chromatography|journal=Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research|volume=31|issue=11|year=1998|pages=1383–1388|issn=1678-4510|doi=10.1590/S0100-879X1998001100003|pmid=9921272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences of Cohn process==
The Cohn process was a major development in the field of blood fractionation. It has several practical uses in treating diseases such as hepatitis and polio. It was most useful during the Second World War where soldiers recovered at a faster rate because of the transfusions with albumin. The Cohn Process has been modified over the years as seen above. In addition, it has influenced other processes with the blood fractionation industry. This has led to new forms of fractionation such as chromatographic plasma fractionation in ion exchange and albumin finishing processes. In general, the Cohn Process and its variations have given a huge boost to and serve as a foundation for the fractionation industry to this day.&lt;ref name="Petz"&gt;Petz, L.D, Swisher S. Clinical Practice of Transfusion Medicine. Churchill-Livingstone. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the process has not been studied well because it is archaic. Most importantly, it has never been modernized by manufacturing companies. In addition, the conventional process can be environmentally unfriendly because ethanol is a highly flammable substance. It is unsanitary because of the open vessels and tanks; thus, the possibility of contamination is high. The cold ethanol format may be too gentle to kill off certain viruses that require heat inactivation. Since this process remains unchanged for so long, several built-in inefficiencies and inconsistencies affect the economics of the process for pharmaceutical and manufacturing companies.&lt;ref name="Petz"/&gt;  One exception to this was the application in Scotland of continuous-flow processing instead of batch processing. This process was devised at the Protein Fractionation Centre (PFC), the plasma fractionation facility of the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS). This process involved in-line monitoring and control of pH and temperature, with flow control of plasma and ethanol streams using precision gear pumps, all under computerised feedback control . As a result, Cohn Fractions I+II+III, IV and V were produced in a few hours, rather than over many days. The continuous-flow preparation of cryoprecipitate was subsequently integrated into the process upstream of Cohn Fractionation.&lt;ref name="pmid26610795"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Foster PR | title = The manufacture of blood plasma products in Scotland: a brief history | journal = Scott Med J | volume = 61 | issue = 1 | pages = 34–41 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26610795 | doi = 10.1177/0036933015619311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, this process still serves as a major foundation for the blood industry in general and its influence can be seen as it is referred to in the development of newer methods. Although it has its drawbacks depending on the variation, the Cohn Process’ main advantage is its practical uses and its utility within pharmacological and medical industries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26187">'''Consumer neuroscience''' is the combination of [[consumer research]] with modern [[neuroscience]].  The goal of the field is to find neural explanations for consumer [[behavior]]s in individuals both with or without disease.

==Consumer research==
[[Consumer research]] has existed for more than a century and has been well established as a combination of [[sociology]], [[psychology]], and [[anthropology]], and popular topics in the field revolve around consumer decision-making, [[advertising]], and [[brand management|branding]].  For decades, however, consumer researchers had never been able to directly record the internal mental processes that govern consumer behavior; they always were limited to designing experiments in which they alter the external conditions in order to view the ways in which changing variables may affect consumer behavior (examples include changing the packaging or changing a subject’s mood).  With the integration of [[neuroscience]] with consumer research, it is possible to go directly into the brain to discover the neural explanations for consumer behavior.  The ability to record brain activity with electrodes and advances in neural imaging technology make it possible to determine specific regions of the brain that are responsible for critical behaviors involved in consumption.&lt;ref name ="review"&gt;Kenning PH, Plassmann H. How Neuroscience Can Inform Consumer Research. IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering. Dec 2008;16(6):532-538.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumer neuroscience is similar to [[neuroeconomics]] and [[neuromarketing]], but subtle, yet distinct differences exist between them.  Neuroeconomics is more of an academic field while neuromarketing and consumer neuroscience are more of an applied science.  Neuromarketing focuses on the study of various marketing techniques and attempts to integrate neuroscience knowledge to help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of said marketing strategies.  Consumer neuroscience is unique among the three because the main focus is on the consumer and how various factors affect individual preferences and purchasing behavior.

== Advertising ==

=== Advertising and emotion ===
Studies of emotion are crucial to advertising research as it has been shown that emotion plays a significant role in ad memorization.&lt;ref&gt;Ambler T, Ioannides A, Rose S, [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tim_Ambler/publication/227582799_Brands_on_the_Brain_Neuro-Images_of_Advertising/links/59e5c021458515250250a263/Brands-on-the-Brain-Neuro-Images-of-Advertising.pdf Brands on the brain: Neuroimages of advertising].

Dec 2008;3(4):353-366.&lt;/ref&gt;  Classically in advertising research, the theory has been that emotion and ratio are represented in different regions of the brain,&lt;ref name="Delgado"/&gt; but neuroscience may be able to disprove this theory by showing that the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] and the [[striatum]] play a role in bilateral emotion processing.&lt;ref name="Ochsner"&gt;Ochsner KN, Gross JJ. [https://tu-dresden.de/mn/psychologie/allgpsy/ressourcen/dateien/lehre/pruefungsliteratur_KN_2013/Ochsner-Gross-2005.pdf The cognitive control of emotion]. Trends in Cognitive Sciences. May 2005;9(5):242-249.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attractiveness of the advertisements correlates with specific changes in brain activity in various brain regions including the [[medial prefrontal cortex]], [[posterior cingulate]], [[nucleus accumbens]] and higher-order visual cortices.&lt;ref name="Kenning"&gt;Kenning P, Plassmann H, Pieper A, Schwindt W, Kugel H  Deppe M. Neural correlates of attractive ads. Working paper. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  This may represent an interaction between the perceived attractiveness of the ad by the consumer and the emotions expressed by the people pictured in the advertisement.&lt;ref name="Plassman"&gt;Plassmann H, Ambler T, Braeutigam S, Kenning P. [http://faculty.insead.edu/hilke-plassmann/documents/6_Plassman_etal_IJA_2007.pdf What can advertisers learn from neuroscience?] International Journal of Advertising. 2007;26(2):151-175.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that ads that use people with positive emotions are perceived as attractive while ads using exclusively text or depicting people with neutral expressions may generally be viewed as unattractive.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;  Unattractive ads activate the anterior insula, which plays a role in the processing of negative emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Greene J, Sommerville R, Nystrom L, Darley J, Cohen J. [http://nwkpsych.rutgers.edu/~kharber/gradseminar/readings/class%204%20readings/Science%202001%20Greene.pdf An fMRI investigation of emotional engagement in moral judgment]. Science, 2001;293(5537): 2105–2108.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both attractive and unattractive ads have been shown to be more memorable than ads described as ambiguously attractive,&lt;ref name="Kenning"/&gt; but more research is needed to determine how this translates to the overall brand perception in the eyes of the consumer and how this may impact future purchasing behavior.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;

===Mental processing of advertisements===
There are various studies that have been conducted to research the question of how [[consumer]]s process and store the information presented in [[advertisements]].  [[Television commercials]] with scene durations lasting longer than 1.5 seconds have been shown to be more memorable one week later than scenes that last less than 1.5 seconds, and scenes that produce the quickest electrical response in the [[left hemisphere|left frontal hemisphere]] have been shown to be more memorable as well.  It has been suggested that the transfer of visual advertising inputs from [[short term memory]] to [[long term memory]] may take place in the [[left hemisphere]], and highly memorable ads can be created by producing the fastest responses in the [[left hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Rossiter JR, Silberstein RB. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Silberstein/publication/285745057_Brain-Imaging_Detection_of_Visual_Scene_Encoding_in_Long-term_Memory_for_TV_Commercials/links/58b0e4de45851503be97f601/Brain-Imaging-Detection-of-Visual-Scene-Encoding-in-Long-term-Memory-for-TV-Commercials.pdf Brain-imaging detection of visual scene encoding in long-term memory for TV commercials]. Journal of Advertising Research. Mar-Apr 2001;41(2):13-21.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these theories have been renounced by some who believe that the research findings may be attributed to extraneous and unmeasured factors.&lt;ref&gt;Crites Jr S, Aikman-Eckenrode S. Making inferences concerning physiological responses: a reply to Rossiter, Silberstein, Harris and Nield. Journal of Advertising Research. 2001;41(2);23–26.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also evidence to suggest that a front to back difference in processing speed may be more influential on ad memorization than left to right differences.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp A, Gray M, Eide P, Silberstein R, Nathan P. Steady-state visually evoked potential topography during processing of emotional valence in healthy subjects. Neuroimage. Dec 2002;17(4):1684–1692.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that there are certain periods of commercials that are far more significant for the consumer in terms of establishing advertising effects.  These short segments are referred to as “branding moments” and are thought to be the most engaging parts of the commercial.  These moments can be identified using an [[EEG]] and analyzing [[alpha waves]] (8–13&amp;nbsp;Hz), [[beta wave]]s (13–30&amp;nbsp;Hz) and [[theta waves]] (4–7&amp;nbsp;Hz).&lt;ref&gt;Young C. Brain waves, picture sorts, and branding moments. Journal of Advertising Research. July 2002; 42(4):42–53.&lt;/ref&gt;  These results may suggest that the strength of a commercial with regard to its effect on the consumer can be evaluated by the strength of its unique branding moments.

=== Affective vs. cognitive ads===
[[Affective]] advertising (using [[comedy]], [[drama]], [[suspense]], etc.) activates the [[amygdala]], the [[orbitofrontal cortex|orbitofrontal cortices]], and the [[brainstem]] whereas cognitive advertising (strict [[fact]]s) mainly activates the [[posterior parietal cortex]] and the [[prefrontal cortex|superior prefrontal cortices]].&lt;ref&gt;Ioannides A, Liu L, Theofilou D, Dammers J, Burne T, Ambler T, Rose S. [https://www.academia.edu/download/36311963/Ioannides_2000_BrainTopog.pdf Real time processing of affective and cognitive stimuli in the human brain extracted from MEG signals]. Brain Topography. 2000; 13(1):11–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ambler and Burne in 1999 created the Memory-Affect-Cognition (MAC) theory to explain the processes involved in [[decision making]].  According to the theory, the majority of decisions are habitual and do not require [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] or [[cognition]]; they require [[memory]] only.&lt;ref name="Ambler1999"&gt;Ambler T, Burne T. The impact of affect on the memory of advertising. Journal of Advertising Research. 1999;39(2):25–34.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the remaining decisions only require [[memory]] and affect; they do not require [[cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro Y. Descartes' error: Emotion, reason, and the human brain - Damasio, AT. Theory &amp; Psychology. Dec 1997;7(6):837-856.&lt;/ref&gt;  The main use for [[cognition]] is in the form of [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]] following a particular action, however, there are occasional instances in which [[memory]], affect and [[cognition]] are all used in conjunction, such as during a debate about a particular choice.&lt;ref name="Ambler1999"/&gt;  The above findings suggest a correlation exists between ad memorization and the degree of affective content within the advertisement, but it is still unclear how this translates to brand memory.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;

== Branding ==

=== Brand associations ===
Much of [[consumer research]] is devoted to studying the effect of [[brand]] associations on consumer preferences and how they manifest into brand memories.  Brand memories can be defined as “everything that exists in the minds of customers with respect to a brand (e.g. thoughts, feelings, experiences, images, perceptions, beliefs and attitudes)”.&lt;ref&gt;Keller K, Lehmann D. How do brands create value? Marketing Management Aug 2003: 15–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have indicated there is not a designated area of the brain devoted to brand recognition.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;  Studies have shown that different areas of the [[brain]] are activated when exposed to a [[brand]] as opposed to a person, and decisions regarding the evaluation of brands in different product categories activate the area of the brain responsible for [[semantics|semantic object]] processing rather than areas involved with the judgment of people.&lt;ref&gt;Yoon C, Gutchess AH, Feinberg F, Polk TA. [http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/feinf/research/published/yoon,_gutchess,_feinberg,_polk_(2006)_-_fmri_neural_dissociations_brand_and_person_judgments.pdf A functional magnetic resonance imaging study of neural dissociations between brand and person judgments]. Journal of Consumer Research. Jun 2006;33(1):31-40.&lt;/ref&gt;  These two findings suggest that [[brands]] are not processed by the [[brain]] in the same manner as human personalities, indicating that [[personality theory]] cannot be used to explain brand preferences.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;

=== Consumer neuroscience explains brand loyalty ===
In a study of [[fMRI]] scans of loyal and less loyal customers it was found that in the case of loyal customers the presence of a particular [[brand]] serves as a reward during choice tasks, but less loyal customers do not exhibit the same reward pathway.  It was also found that loyal customers had greater activation in the [[brain]] areas concerned with [[emotion]] and [[memory retrieval]] suggesting that loyal customers develop an [[affective]] bond with a particular brand, which serves as the primary motivation for repeat purchases.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;

Brand loyalty has been shown to be the result of changes in [[neural]] activity in the [[striatum]], which is part of the [[reward system|human action reward system]].&lt;ref&gt;Plassmann H, Kenning P, Ahlert D. [http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v34/500830_101409_v2.pdf Why companies should make their customers happy: The neural correlates of customer loyalty]. Adv. Consumer Rese. – North Amer. Conf. Proc., 2007; 34: 735–39.&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to become brand loyal the [[brain]] must make a decision of brand A over brand B, a process which relies on the brain to make predictions based upon expected reward and then evaluate the results to learn loyalty.  The [[brain]] is required to remember both positive and negative outcomes of previous brand choices in order to accurately be able to make predictions regarding the expected outcome of future brand decisions.  For example, a helpful salesman or a discount in price may serve as a reward to encourage future customer loyalty.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;  It is thought that the [[amygdala]] and [[striatum]] are the two most prominent structures for predicting the outcomes of decisions, and that the [[brain]] learns to better predict in part by establishing a larger [[neural network]] in these structures.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried JA, O'Doherty J, Dolan RJ. [http://000ev39.myregisteredwp.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3661/2017/01/Encoding-Predictive-Reward-Value-in-Human-Amygdala-and-Orbitofrontal-Cortex.pdf Encoding predictive reward value in human amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex]. Science. Aug 2003;301(5636):1104-1107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knutson B, Fong GW, Adams CM, Varner JL, Hommer D.

Dec 2001;12(17):3683-3687.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to [[Scientific modelling|model]] how the [[brain]] learns, a temporal difference learning algorithm has been developed which takes into account expected reward, stimuli presence, reward evaluation, temporal error, and individual differences.  As yet this is a theoretical [[equation]], but it may be solved in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz W, Dayan P, Montague PR. A neural substrate of prediction and reward. Science. Mar 1997;275(5306):1593-1599.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== How branding affects consumers ===
[[Brands]] serve to connect [[consumer]]s to the products they are purchasing either by establishing an emotional connection or by creating a particular image.  It has been shown that when consumers are forced to choose an item from a group in which a familiar brand is present the choice is much easier than when consumers are forced to choose from a group of entirely unfamiliar brands.&lt;ref name="Braeutigam"&gt;Braeutigam S, Rose SPR, Swithenby SJ, Ambler T. The distributed neuronal systems supporting choice-making in real-life situations: differences between men and women when choosing groceries detected using magnetoencephalography. European Journal of Neuroscience. Jul 2004;20(1):293-302.&lt;/ref&gt;  One [[MRI]] study found that there was significantly increased activation in the [[brain]] reward centers including the [[orbitofrontal cortex]], the [[ventral striatum]] and the [[anterior cingulate]] when consumers were looking at [[sports cars]] as compared to [[sedans]] (presumably because the status symbol associated with sports cars is rewarding in some way).&lt;ref&gt;Erk S, Kiefer M, Grothe J, Wunderlich AP, Spitzer M, Walter H. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Markus_Kiefer/publication/10893254_Emotional_Context_Modulates_Subsequent_Memory_Effect/links/59db2154a6fdcc2aad14d046/Emotional-Context-Modulates-Subsequent-Memory-Effect.pdf Emotional context modulates subsequent memory effect]. Neuroimage. Feb 2003;18(2):439-447.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many [[corporations]] have conducted similar [[MRI]] studies to investigate the effect of their brand on consumers including [[Delta Air Lines]], [[General Motors]], [[Home Depot]], [[Hallmark]], and [[Motorola]] but the results have not been made public.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;

A study by McClure et al. investigated the difference in branding between [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]].  The study found that when the two drinks were tasted blind there was no difference in consumer preference between the brands. Both drinks produced equal activation in the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]], which is thought to be activated because the taste is rewarding.  When the subjects were informed of the brand names the consumers preferred [[Coca-Cola|Coke]], and only [[Coca-Cola|Coke]] activated the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]], suggesting that drinking the [[Coca-Cola|Coke]] brand is rewarding beyond simply the taste itself.  More subjects preferred [[Coca-Cola|Coke]] when they knew it was [[Coca-Cola|Coke]] than when the taste testing was anonymous, which demonstrates the power of branding to influence consumer behavior.  There was also significant activation in the [[hippocampus]] and [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] when subjects knew they were drinking Coke.  These brain structures are known to play a role in [[memory]] and [[recollection]], which indicates they are helping the subjects to connect their present drinking experience to previous [[brand]] associations.  The study proposes that there are two separate processes contributing to consumer decision making: the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] responds to sensory inputs and the [[hippocampus]] and [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] recall previous associations to cultural information.  According to the results of this study, the Coke brand has much more firmly established itself as a rewarding experience.&lt;ref name="McClure"&gt;McClure SM, Li J, Tomlin D, Cypert KS, Montague LM, Montague PR. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627304006129 Neural correlates of behavioral preference for culturally familiar drinks]. Neuron. Oct 2004;44(2):379-387.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purchasing ==
Research in consumer buying has focused on the identification of processes that contribute to an individual making a [[purchase]].  The [[brain]] does not contain a “buy button”, but rather recruits several processes during choice tasks, and studies report that the [[prefrontal cortex]] is heavily involved in limiting the [[emotions]] expressed during [[impulse buying]].  Reducing the effect of these executive control areas of the [[brain]] may contribute to changes in purchasing behavior,&lt;ref name="Ochsner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ambler T, Braeutigam S, Stins J, Rose S, Swithenby S. [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5d7c/d8bd699978260ab2e1b109e11a0cbd18838c.pdf Salience and choice: Neural correlates of shopping decisions]. Psychology &amp; Marketing. Apr 2004;21(4):247-261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulus MP, Frank LR. [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f0d0/82db9a11210e7be376915d8b89e510ee1c30.pdf Ventromedial prefrontal cortex activation is critical for preference judgments]. NeuroReport. Jul 2003;14(10):1311-1315.&lt;/ref&gt; for example music may lead to reduced cognitive control which is why it has been shown to correlate with a higher percentage of unplanned purchases.&lt;ref&gt;Shiv B, Fedorikhin A. [http://sites.google.com/site/xiaoliangtushuguanfenguan3/gm934xing-wei-jue-ce-zhi-ding/Shiv%26Fedorikhin1999.pdf Heart and mind in conflict: The interplay of affect and cognition in consumer decision making]. J. Consumer Res. Dec 1999; 26: 278–292.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Purchasing process ===
Several [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] studies have been conducted to measure the [[neural correlate|neuronal correlates]] associated with decision making in order to investigate the underlying processes governing purchasing.  The studies suggest that decisions involved with purchasing can be seen as occurring in two halves.  The first half is concerned with [[memory|memory recall]] and problem identification and recognition.  The second half is associated with the purchasing decision itself; familiar [[brands]] produce different [[Neural oscillation|brain patterns]] than do nonfamiliar brands.  The [[parietal cortex|right parietal cortex]] is activated when [[consumer]]s choose a familiar brand, which indicates the choice is at least partially intentional and behavior is influenced by prior experiences.&lt;ref name="Ambler2004"&gt;Ambler, T., Braeutigam, S., Stins, J., Rose, S.P.R. &amp; Swithenby, S.J. (2004) [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5d7c/d8bd699978260ab2e1b109e11a0cbd18838c.pdf Salience and choice: neural correlates of shopping decisions]. Psychology &amp; Marketing, 21, pp. 247–261.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Familiar vs. unfamiliar purchases ===
When [[consumer]]s select less well known products or products that are completely unfamiliar, several areas of the [[brain]] are activated to help with the decision making process that are not activated when consumers select more well known products.  There is an increased synchronization between the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex|right dorsolateral cortices]] (associated with consideration of multiple sources of information), there is increased activity in the [[orbitofrontal cortex|right orbitofrontal cortex]] (associated with evaluation of rewards) and there is increased activity in the [[inferior frontal gyrus|left inferior frontal cortex]] (associated with silent vocalization).  Activation in these [[brain]] structures indicates that the decision between less well known products is difficult in some way.&lt;ref name="Ambler2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Braeutigam"/&gt;  MEG findings also suggest that even repetitive daily shopping that is apparently simple actually relies on very complex neural mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;

== Associated areas of the brain ==

=== Ventromedial prefrontal cortex ===
It has been shown that the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] is heavily involved in decisions regarding brand-related preferences and individuals with damage to this region of the brain do not demonstrate normal brand-preference behavior.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt; People with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex have also been found to be more easily influenced by misleading advertisement.&lt;ref name="Asp, Erik, et al. 2012"&gt;Asp, E., Manzel, K., Koestner, B., Cole, C. A., Denburg, N. L., &amp; Tranel, D. (2012). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3391647/ A neuropsychological test of belief and doubt: damage to ventromedial prefrontal cortex increases credulity for misleading advertising]. Frontiers in neuroscience, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amygdala and striatum ===
It is thought that the [[amygdala]] and [[striatum]] are the two most prominent structures for predicting the outcomes of decisions, and that the [[brain]] learns to better make predictions in part by establishing a larger [[neural network]] in these structures.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;

===Hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex===
The [[hippocampus]] and [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] help consumers recall previous associations with cultural information and cultural expectations.  These associations with prior information serve to modify consumer behavior and influence purchasing decisions.&lt;ref name="McClure"/&gt;

== Real-world applications ==
[[Consumer research]] provides a real-world application for [[neuroscience]] studies.  Consumer studies help [[neuroscience]] to learn more about how healthy and unhealthy brain functions differ, which may assist in discovering the neural source of consumption-related dysfunctions and treat a variety of [[Substance dependence|addictions]].  Additionally, studies are currently underway to investigate the neural mechanism of “anchoring”, which has been thought to contribute to [[obesity]] because people are more influenced by the behaviors of their peers than an internal standard.  Discovering a neural source of anchoring may be the key to preventing behaviors that typically lead to [[obesity]].&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;

==Limitations==
# Most of the consumer neuroscience studies involving [[neuroimaging|brain scanning techniques]] have been conducted in medical or technological environments where such [[neuroimaging|brain imaging devices]] are present.  This is not a realistic environment for consumer decision making and may serve to skew the data relative to consumer decision making in normal consumer environments.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;
# Testing underlying neurophysiological principles is extraordinarily difficult from an experimental setup standpoint simply because it is unclear exactly how various factors are perceived in the human mind.  An extremely comprehensive understanding of the neuroscientific testing techniques to be used is required to be able to establish proper controls and create an environment such that test subjects are not inadvertently exposed to unwanted stimuli that may bias results.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;
# There are many concerns over the value and the potential usage of consumer neuroscience data.  The potential for enhanced consumer welfare is certainly present but equally present is the potential for the information to be used inappropriately for individual gain.  The reaction to emerging study results in both the public and the media remains to be seen.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;
# In its current state, consumer neuroscience research is a compilation of only loosely related subjects that is unable, at this point, to produce any collective conclusions.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;

A '''Credit Derivatives Product Company''', or CDPC, is a business focused on trading in [[credit default swap]]s contracts.  That is, a CDPC typically sells insurance against someone failing to pay back a loan ('defaulting'). A CDPC is usually highly leveraged, meaning that if even a portion of its held credit default portfolio were to be 'triggered' at once, the CDPC would not have the capital to fully pay out the resulting insurance claims. The CDPC business model is dependent on a triple-A rating from a [[credit rating agency]]&lt;ref name="dweek1"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.mayerbrown.com/publications/article.asp?id=4177&amp;nid=6 | format = pdf | date = 2008-01-28 | author = Edmund Parker, Melanie Barrow | accessdate = 2010-05-03 | title = LEARNING CURVE: Credit Derivative Product Companies – A Primer }}.

The first CDPC was Primus Financial Products, launched in 2002.&lt;ref name="dweek1"/&gt;  In October 2008 [[Fitch Ratings]] withdrew its ratings on all five CDPCs that it had previously rated, citing in part "the uncertain business prospects for CDPCs".&lt;ref name="fitchdown"&gt;

'''DVD''' (an abbreviation of "'''digital video disc'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DVD|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dvd?s=t|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "'''digital versatile disc'''")&lt;ref&gt;''Popular Mechanics'', June 1997, p. 69;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jim Taylor, ''DVD demystified'', McGraw Hill, 1998, 1st edition, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[digital media|digital]] [[optical disc]] [[data storage device|storage]] format invented and developed in 1995. The medium can store any kind of digital data and is widely used for software and other computer files as well as video programs watched using [[DVD player]]s. DVDs offer higher storage capacity than [[compact disc]]s while having the same dimensions.

Prerecorded DVDs are mass-produced using [[Injection molding machine|molding machines]] that physically stamp data onto the DVD. Such discs are a form of DVD-[[read-only memory|ROM]] because data can only be read and not written or erased. Blank recordable DVD discs ([[DVD-R]] and [[DVD+R]]) can be recorded once using a [[Optical disc drive|DVD recorder]] and then function as a DVD-ROM. Rewritable DVDs ([[DVD-RW]], [[DVD+RW]], and [[DVD-RAM]]) can be recorded and erased many times.

DVDs are used in [[DVD-Video]] consumer digital video format and in [[DVD-Audio]] consumer digital audio format as well as for authoring DVD discs written in a special [[AVCHD#AVCHD as distribution format|AVCHD]] format to hold [[High-definition video|high definition]] material (often in conjunction with AVCHD format [[camcorder]]s). DVDs containing other types of information may be referred to as DVD data discs.

== Etymology ==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' comments that, "In 1995 rival manufacturers of the product initially named digital video disc agreed that, in order to emphasize the flexibility of the format for multimedia applications, the preferred abbreviation DVD would be understood to denote digital versatile disc." The OED also states that in 1995, "The companies said the official name of the format will simply be DVD. Toshiba had been using the name ‘digital video disc’, but that was switched to ‘digital versatile disc’ after computer companies complained that it left out their applications."&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''DVD''.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Digital versatile disc" is the explanation provided in a DVD Forum Primer from 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

There were several formats developed for recording video on optical discs before the DVD. Optical recording technology was invented by [[David Paul Gregg]] and [[James Russell (inventor)|James Russell]] in 1958 and first patented in 1961. A consumer optical disc data format known as [[LaserDisc]] was developed in the [[United States of America|United States]], and first came to market in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] in 1978. It used much larger discs than the later formats. Due to the high cost of players and discs, consumer adoption of LaserDisc was very low in both North America and Europe, and was not widely used anywhere outside Japan and the more affluent areas of [[Southeast Asia]], such as [[Hong-Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Taiwan]].

[[CD Video]] released in 1987 used analog video encoding on optical discs matching the established standard {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} size of audio CDs. [[Video CD]] (VCD) became one of the first formats for distributing ''digitally'' encoded films in this format, in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Super Video Compact Disc, A Technical Explanation (PDF) | year = 1998 | publisher = [[Philips]] System Standards and Licensing | page = 2 | url = http://www.ip.philips.com/view_attachment/2450/sl00812.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2008-02-13 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

One was the Multimedia [[Compact Disc]] (MMCD), backed by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]], and the other was the Super Density (SD) disc, supported by [[Toshiba]], [[Time Warner]], [[Matsushita Electric]], [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]], [[Mitsubishi Electric]], [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]], [[Thomson SA|Thomson]], and [[JVC]]. By the time of the press launches for both formats in January 1995, the MMCD nomenclature had been dropped, and Philips and Sony were referring to their format as Digital Video Disc (DVD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=WCES: The Calm Before the Storm |journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=3|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1995|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NGen6"&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=DVD Plagued by Double Standards |journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=6|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=June 1995|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representatives from the SD camp asked [[IBM]] for advice on the file system to use for their disc, and sought support for their format for storing computer data. [[Alan E. Bell]], a researcher from IBM's [[Almaden Research Center]], got that request, and also learned of the MMCD development project. Wary of being caught in a repeat of the costly [[videotape format war]] between [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] in the 1980s, he convened a group of computer industry experts, including representatives from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Microsoft]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Dell]], and many others. This group was referred to as the Technical Working Group, or TWG.

On August 14, 1995, an [[ad hoc]] group formed from five computer companies (IBM, Apple, [[Compaq]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], and Microsoft) issued a press release stating that they would only accept a single format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Electronic Giants Battle On|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=11|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=November 1995|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TWG voted to boycott both formats unless the two camps agreed on a single, converged standard. They recruited [[Lou Gerstner]], president of IBM, to pressure the executives of the warring factions. In one significant compromise, the MMCD and SD groups agreed to adopt proposal SD 9, which specified that both layers of the dual-layered disc be read from the same side—instead of proposal SD 10, which would have created a two-sided disc that users would have to turn over.&lt;ref name="Soon"&gt;{{cite journal |page=189 |journal = [[Computer Shopper (US magazine)|Computer Shopper]] |date=March 1, 1996|volume=16|issue= 3|title=DVD: coming soon to your PC?}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the DVD specification provided a storage capacity of 4.7 GB for a single-layered, single-sided disc and 8.5 GB for a dual-layered, single-sided disc.&lt;ref name="Soon"/&gt; The DVD specification ended up similar to Toshiba and Matsushita's Super Density Disc, except for the dual-layer option (MMCD was single-sided and optionally dual-layer, whereas SD was two half-thickness, single-layer discs which were pressed separately and then glued together to form a double-sided disc&lt;ref name="NGen6"/&gt;) and [[Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation|EFMPlus]] modulation designed by [[Kees Schouhamer Immink]].

Philips and Sony decided that it was in their best interests to end the format war, and agreed to unify with companies backing the Super Density Disc to release a single format, with technologies from both. After other compromises between MMCD and SD, the computer companies through TWG won the day, and a single format was agreed upon. The TWG also collaborated with the [[Optical Storage Technology Association]] (OSTA) on the use of their implementation of the ISO-13346 file system (known as [[Universal Disk Format]]) for use on the new DVDs.

=== Adoption ===
[[Movie]] and [[home video|home entertainment]] distributors adopted the DVD format to replace the ubiquitous [[VHS]] tape as the primary consumer digital video distribution format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3335984/DVD-kills-the-video-show-as-digital-age-takes-over.html|title=DVD kills the video show as digital age takes over|first=Robert|last=Uhlig|date=22 November 2004|accessdate=28 October 2017|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; They embraced DVD as it produced higher quality video and sound, provided superior data lifespan, and could be interactive.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Interactivity on [[LaserDisc]]s had proven desirable to consumers, especially collectors. When LaserDisc prices dropped from approximately $100 per disc to $20 per disc at retail, this luxury feature became available for mass consumption. Simultaneously, the movie studios decided to change their home entertainment release model from a rental model to a for purchase model,{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} and large numbers of DVDs were sold.

At the same time, a demand for interactive design talent and services was created. Movies in the past had uniquely designed title sequences. Suddenly every movie being released required information architecture and interactive design components that matched the film's tone and were at the quality level that Hollywood demanded for its product.

DVD as a format had two qualities at the time that were not available in any other interactive medium: enough capacity and speed to provide high quality, full motion video and sound, and low cost delivery mechanism provided by consumer products retailers. Retailers would quickly move to sell their players for under $200, and eventually for under $50 at retail. In addition, the medium itself was small enough and light enough to mail using general first class postage. Almost overnight, this created a new business opportunity and model for business innovators to re-invent the home entertainment distribution model. It also gave companies an inexpensive way to provide business and product information on full motion video through direct mail.

Immediately following the formal adoption of a unified standard for DVD, two of the four leading [[video game console]] companies ([[Sega]] and [[The 3DO Company]]) said they already had plans to design a gaming console with DVDs as the source medium.&lt;ref name="NGen18"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=DVD Game Consoles? |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=18 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=June 1996|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Sony, despite being one of the developers of the DVD format and eventually the first company to actually release a DVD-based console, stated at the time that they had no plans to use DVD in their gaming systems.&lt;ref name="NGen18"/&gt;) Game consoles such as the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], and [[Xbox 360]] use DVDs as their source medium for games and other software. Contemporary games for Windows were also distributed on DVD.

==Specifications==
The DVD specifications created and updated by the [[DVD Forum]] are published as so-called ''DVD Books'' (e.g. DVD-ROM Book, DVD-Audio Book, DVD-Video Book, DVD-R Book, DVD-RW Book, DVD-RAM Book, [[DVD-AR]] Book, [[DVD-VR]] Book, etc.).&lt;ref name="dvd-book"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdfllc.co.jp/format/f_bconst.html|title=DVD FLLC - DVD Format Book|website=Dvdfllc.co.jp|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dvd-books"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdfllc.co.jp/format/f_histry.html|title=DVD FLLC - DVD Format Book|website=Dvdfllc.co.jp|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dvd-books-overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpeg.org/MPEG/DVD/General/Books.html|title=BOOKS OVERVIEW|website=Mpeg.org|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some specifications for mechanical, physical and optical characteristics of DVD optical discs can be downloaded as freely available standards from the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] website.&lt;ref name="iso-free"&gt;ISO [http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html ISO Freely Available Standards], Retrieved on 2009-07-24&lt;/ref&gt; There are also equivalent [[European Computer Manufacturers Association]] (Ecma) standards for some of these specifications, such as Ecma-267 for DVD-ROMs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-267.htm|title=Standard ECMA-267|website=Ecma-international.org|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the [[DVD+RW Alliance]] publishes competing recordable DVD specifications such as DVD+R, DVD+R DL, DVD+RW or [[DVD+RW DL]].

== DVD recordable and rewritable ==
{{Main|DVD recordable}}
[[File:Sony-Internal-PC-DVD-Drive-Opened.jpg|thumb|right|A DVD burner drive for a PC]]
[[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] initially developed recordable DVD media from the need to store data for backup and transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watson|first=James|title=The recordable DVD clinic|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/10/15/the_recordable_dvd_clinic/|publisher=The Register|accessdate=15 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DVD recordables are now also used for consumer audio and video recording. Three formats were developed: [[DVD-R]]/[[DVD-RW|RW]], [[DVD+R]]/[[DVD+RW|RW]] (plus), and [[DVD-RAM]]. DVD-R is available in two formats, General (650&amp;nbsp;nm) and Authoring (635&amp;nbsp;nm), where Authoring discs may be recorded with [[Content Scramble System|CSS]] encrypted video content but General discs may not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taperesources.com/dvd_media.html#article2 |title=DVD Media / DVD-R Media |publisher=Tape Resources |date= |accessdate=2011-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727112708/http://www.taperesources.com/dvd_media.html |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most DVD writers can nowadays write the DVD+R/RW and DVD-R/RW formats (usually denoted by "DVD±RW" or the existence of both the [[DVD Forum]] logo and the DVD+RW Alliance logo), the "plus" and the "dash" formats use different writing specifications. Most DVD readers and players play both kinds of discs, though older models can have trouble with the "plus" variants.

Some first generation [[DVD player]]s would cause damage to DVD±R/RW/DL when attempting to read them.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The form of the spiral groove that makes up the structure of a recordable DVD encodes unalterable identification data known as [[Media Identification Code]] (MID). The MID contains data such as the manufacturer and model, byte capacity, allowed data rates (also known as speed), etc..{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

=== Dual-layer recording ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[DVD-DL]] --&gt;
[[File:Sony DVD+RW.jpg|thumb|Sony Rewritable DVD]]
Dual-layer recording (sometimes also known as double-layer recording) allows [[DVD-R]] and [[DVD+R]] discs to store significantly more data—up to 8.5 [[gigabyte]]s per disc, compared with 4.7 gigabytes for single-layer discs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DVDs|url=http://www.ncte.ie/documents/advicesheets/06DVDNov08.pdf|publisher=PDST Technology in Education|accessdate=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with this, DVD-DLs have slower write speeds as compared to ordinary DVDs. When played, a slight transition can sometimes be seen in the playback when the player changes layers. [[DVD-R DL]] was developed for the [[DVD Forum]] by [[Pioneer Corporation]]; [[DVD+R DL]] was developed for the DVD+RW Alliance by [[Mitsubishi Kagaku Media]] (MKM) and [[Philips]].&lt;ref name="Dual-layer-BurnWorld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burnworld.com/howto/articles/intro-to-dual-layer.htm|title=Understanding Dual Layer DVD Recording |publisher=BurnWorld.com |last=DeMoulin |first=Robert |accessdate=2007-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dual-layer disc differs from its single layered counterpart by employing a second physical layer within the disc itself. The drive with dual-layer capability accesses the second layer by shining the laser through the first semitransparent layer. In some DVD players, the layer change can exhibit a noticeable pause, up to several seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/cgi-bin/shootout.cgi?function=search&amp;articles=all&amp;type=&amp;manufacturer=0&amp;maxprice=0&amp;deInt=0&amp;mpeg=0#SamsungBD-P1000%20Blu-ray/DVD%20Player%20(HDMI) |title=DVD players benchmark |publisher=hometheaterhifi.com |accessdate=2008-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313232626/http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/cgi-bin/shootout.cgi?function=search&amp;articles=all&amp;type=&amp;manufacturer=0&amp;maxprice=0&amp;deInt=0&amp;mpeg=0 |archivedate=March 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused some viewers to worry that their dual-layer discs were damaged or defective, with the end result that studios began listing a standard message explaining the dual-layer pausing effect on all dual-layer disc packaging.

DVD recordable discs supporting this technology are backward-compatible with some existing DVD players and DVD-ROM drives.&lt;ref name="Dual-layer-BurnWorld" /&gt; Many current [[DVD recorder]]s support dual-layer technology, and the price is now comparable to that of single-layer drives, although the blank media remain more expensive. The recording speeds reached by dual-layer media are still well below those of single-layer media.

Dual layer DVDs are recorded using ''[[Opposite Track Path]]'' (OTP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://documentation.apple.com/en/dvdstudiopro/usermanual/index.html#chapter=22&amp;section=10&amp;tasks=true|title=DVD Studio Pro 4 User Manual|website=documentation.apple.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DVD-ROM discs mastered for computer use are produced with track 0 starting at the inside diameter (as is the case with a single layer).  Track 1 then starts at the outside diameter. DVD video discs are mastered slightly differently.  The video is divided between the layers such that layer 1 can be made to start at the same diameter that layer 0 finishes.  This speeds up the transition as the layer changes because although the laser does have to refocus on layer 1, it does not have to skip across the disc to find it.

== Capacity ==
The basic types of DVD (12&amp;nbsp;cm diameter, single-sided or homogeneous double-sided) are referred to by a rough approximation of their capacity in gigabytes. In draft versions of the specification, DVD-5 indeed held five gigabytes, but some parameters were changed later on as explained above, so the capacity decreased. Other [[DVD formats|formats]], those with 8&amp;nbsp;cm diameter and hybrid variants, acquired similar numeric names with even larger deviation.

The 12&amp;nbsp;cm type is a standard DVD, and the 8&amp;nbsp;cm variety is known as a [[MiniDVD]]. These are the same sizes as a standard CD and a [[mini CD|mini-CD]], respectively. The capacity by surface area (MiB/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) varies from 6.92 MiB/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the DVD-1 to 18.0 MB/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the DVD-18.{{clarify|date=May 2018|reason=is this actually MiB for DVD-18?}}

Each DVD sector contains 2,418 bytes of data, 2,048 bytes of which are user data. There is a small difference in storage space between ''+'' and ''-'' (hyphen) formats:

== DVD drives and players ==
{{See also|Optical disc drive|DVD player}}
DVD drives are devices that can read DVD discs on a computer. [[DVD player]]s are a particular type of devices that do not require a computer to work, and can read [[DVD-Video]] and [[DVD-Audio]] discs.

=== Laser and optics ===
[[File:Comparison CD DVD HDDVD BD.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Comparison of various optical storage media&lt;!-- parameters: track pitch (p), pit width (w) and minimum length (l), and laser spot size (⌀) and wavelength (λ). --&gt;]]

All three common optical disc media ([[Compact disc]], DVD, and [[Blu-ray]]) use light from [[laser diode]]s, for its spectral purity and ability to be focused precisely.  DVD uses light of 650&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength (red), as opposed to 780&amp;nbsp;nm ([[far-red]], commonly called [[infrared]]) for CD. This shorter wavelength allows a smaller pit on the media surface compared to CDs (0.74&amp;nbsp;µm for DVD versus 1.6&amp;nbsp;µm for CD), accounting in part for DVD's increased storage capacity.

In comparison, [[Blu-ray Disc]], the successor to the DVD format, uses a wavelength of
405&amp;nbsp;nm (violet), and one dual-layer disc has a 50&amp;nbsp;GB storage capacity.

Read and write speeds for the first DVD drives and players were 1,385&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|kB]]/s (1,353&amp;nbsp;[[kibibyte|KiB]]/s); this speed is usually called "1×". More recent models, at 18× or 20×, have 18 or 20 times that speed. Note that for CD drives, 1× means 153.6&amp;nbsp;kB/s (150&amp;nbsp;KiB/s), about one-ninth as swift.&lt;ref name="DVD Demystified" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osta.org/technology/dvdqa/dvdqa4.htm |title=Understanding DVD -Recording Speed |publisher=Osta.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== DVD-Video ==
{{Main|DVD-Video}}

DVD-Video is a standard for distributing video/audio content on DVD media. The format went on sale in Japan in 1995, in the United States, Canada, Central America, and Indonesia in 1997, and in Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa in 1998. DVD-Video became the dominant form of home video distribution in Japan when it first went on sale in 1995, but it shared the market for home video distribution in the United States until June 15, 2003, when weekly DVD-Video in the United States rentals began outnumbering weekly VHS cassette rentals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Anna |last=Bakalis |title=It's unreel: DVD rentals overtake videocassettes |work=[[Washington Times]] |date=2003-06-20 |url=http://washingtontimes.com/business/20030620-113258-1104r.htm|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
DVD-Video is still the dominant form of home video distribution worldwide except for in Japan where it was surpassed by [[Blu-ray Disc]] when Blu-ray first went on sale in Japan on March 31, 2006.

=== Security ===
{{Main|Content Scramble System}}
The Content Scramble System (CSS) is a [[digital rights management]] (DRM) and [[encryption]] system employed on almost all commercially produced DVD-video discs. CSS utilizes a [[wikt:proprietary|proprietary]] [[40-bit encryption|40-bit]] [[stream cipher]] algorithm. The system was introduced around 1996 and was first compromised in 1999.

The purpose of CSS is twofold:
# CSS prevents byte-for-byte copies of an [[Moving Picture Experts Group|MPEG]] (digital video) stream from being playable since such copies do not include the keys that are hidden on the lead-in area of the restricted DVD.
# CSS provides a reason for manufacturers to make their devices compliant with an industry-controlled standard, since CSS scrambled discs cannot in principle be played on noncompliant devices; anyone wishing to build compliant devices must obtain a license, which contains the requirement that the rest of the DRM system ([[DVD region code|region codes]], [[Macrovision]], and [[user operation prohibition]]) be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvd-copy.com/reference/IEEE-doc-copyproc.pdf IEEE - Copy Protection for DVD Video p.2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318151452/http://www.dvd-copy.com/reference/IEEE-doc-copyproc.pdf |date=March 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most CSS-decrypting software is used to play DVD videos, other pieces of software (such as [[DVD Decrypter]], [[AnyDVD]], [[DVD43]], Smartripper, and [[DVD Shrink]]) can copy a DVD to a hard drive and remove [[Macrovision]], CSS encryption, [[DVD region code|region codes]] and [[user operation prohibition]].

=== Consumer restrictions ===
The rise of [[filesharing]] has prompted many copyright holders to display notices on DVD [[Optical disc packaging|packaging]] or displayed on screen when the content is played that warn consumers of the illegality of certain uses of the DVD. It is commonplace to include a 90-second advertisement warning that most forms of copying the contents are illegal. Many DVDs prevent skipping past or fast-forwarding through this warning.

&lt;!--
Add text about...
... the DMCA, CSS encryption, and how making backups of one's own purchased video DVDs is illegal because one would be required to violate the DMCA by cracking the CSS encryption on the DVD;
... how this has impacted free DVD playback software on free computer OSes such as Linux (see article on DeCSS);
... consumer protest of the above (by printing CSS cracking software code on t-shirts, for example)
--&gt;
Arrangements for renting and lending differ by geography. In the U.S., the right to re-sell, rent, or lend out bought DVDs is protected by the [[first-sale doctrine]] under the [[Copyright Act of 1976]]. In Europe, rental and lending rights are more limited, under a 1992 European Directive that gives copyright holders broader powers to restrict the commercial renting and public lending of DVD copies of their work. &lt;!-- Add note about the Librarian of Congress's three-year exemption proclamations, and how DVDs have been at the
forefront of the public discussions every time. --&gt;

== DVD-Audio ==
{{Main|DVD-Audio}}

DVD-Audio is a format for delivering high fidelity audio content on a DVD. It offers many channel configuration options (from [[monaural|mono]] to [[5.1 surround sound]]) at various sampling frequencies (up to 24-bits/192&amp;nbsp;kHz versus [[Red Book (CD standard)|CDDA]]'s 16-bits/44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz). Compared with the CD format, the much higher-capacity DVD format enables the inclusion of considerably more music (with respect to total running time and quantity of songs) or far higher audio quality (reflected by higher [[sampling rate]]s, greater sample resolution and additional channels for [[spatial sound]] reproduction).

DVD-Audio briefly formed a niche market, probably due to the very sort of format war with rival standard [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] that [[DVD-Video]] avoided.

=== Security ===
{{Main|Content Protection for Recordable Media}}

DVD-Audio discs employ a [[Digital rights management|DRM]] mechanism, called [[Content Protection for Prerecorded Media]] (CPPM), developed by the 4C group (IBM, Intel, Matsushita, and Toshiba).

Although CPPM was supposed to be much harder to crack than a DVD-Video [[Content Scramble System|CSS]], it too was eventually cracked, in 2007, with the release of the ''dvdcpxm'' tool. The subsequent release of the libdvdcpxm library (based on dvdcpxm) allowed for the development of open source DVD-Audio players and ripping software. As a result, making 1:1 copies of DVD-Audio discs is now possible with relative ease, much like DVD-Video discs.

==Successors and decline==
{{update|date=February 2018}}

In 2006, two new formats called [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray Disc]] were released as the successor to DVD. HD DVD competed unsuccessfully with Blu-ray Disc in the [[format war]] [[High definition optical disc format war|of 2006–2008]]. A dual layer HD DVD can store up to 30 GB and a dual layer Blu-ray disc can hold up to 50 GB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Blu-ray Disc? |publisher=Sony |url=http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;identifier=S_BrandShowcase_Blu-ray|accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DVD FAQ: 3.13 – What about the new HD formats? |url=http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html#3.13 |accessdate=2008-11-25 |date=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, unlike previous format changes, e.g., vinyl to Compact Disc or VHS videotape to DVD, there is no immediate indication that production of the standard DVD will gradually wind down, as they still dominate, with around 75% of video sales and approximately one billion DVD player sales worldwide {{as of|2011|April|3|lc=y}}. In fact, experts claim that the DVD will remain the dominant medium for at least another five years as Blu-ray technology is still in its introductory phase, write and read speeds being poor and necessary hardware being expensive and not readily available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.movieweb.com/dvd/news/20/26720.php |title=High-Definition Sales Far Behind Standard DVD's First Two Years |publisher=Movieweb.com |date=2008-02-20 |accessdate=2009-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914030503/http://www.movieweb.com/dvd/news/20/26720.php |archivedate=2008-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blu-ray takes 25% Market share:|url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/MarketShare/index.php |accessdate=2011-06-28 |date=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumers initially were also slow to adopt Blu-ray due to the cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martorana |first=Robert |url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/171207-slow-blu-ray-adoption-a-threat-to-hollywood-s-bottom-line |title=Slow Blu-ray Adoption: A Threat to Hollywood's Bottom Line? |publisher=Seeking Alpha |date=2009-11-04 |accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, 85% of stores were selling Blu-ray Discs. A high-definition television and appropriate connection cables are also required to take advantage of Blu-ray disc. Some analysts suggest that the biggest obstacle to replacing DVD is due to its installed base; a large majority of consumers are satisfied with DVDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_16/b3879008_mz001.htm |title=Gates And Ballmer On "Making The Transition" |work=BusinessWeek |date=2004-04-19 |accessdate=2009-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826072638/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_16/b3879008_mz001.htm |archivedate=2009-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD succeeded because it offered a compelling alternative to VHS. In addition, the uniform media size let manufacturers make Blu-ray players and now defunct format HD DVD players [[backward-compatible]], so they can play older DVDs. This stands in contrast to the change from vinyl to CD, and from tape to DVD, which involved a complete change in physical medium. {{As of|2018}} it is still commonplace for studios to issue major releases in "combo pack" format, including both a DVD and a Blu-ray disc (as well as, a digital copy). Also, some multi-disc sets use Blu-ray for the main feature, but DVDs for supplementary features (examples of this include the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' "Ultimate Edition" collections, the 2009 re-release of the 1967 ''[[The Prisoner]]'' TV series, and a 2007 collection related to ''[[Blade Runner]]''). Another reason cited (July 2011) for the slower transition to Blu-ray from DVD is the necessity of and confusion over "firmware updates" and needing an internet connection to perform updates.

This situation is similar to the changeover from [[78 rpm]] shellac recordings to 45 rpm and 33⅓ rpm vinyl recordings. Because the new and old mediums were virtually the same (a disc on a turntable, played by a needle), [[phonograph]] player manufacturers continued to include the ability to play 78s for decades after the format was discontinued.

Manufacturers continue to release standard DVD titles {{as of|2018|lc=y}}, and the format remains the preferred one for the release of older television programs and films. Some programs, such as ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' must be re-scanned to produce a high definition version from the original film recordings. (Certain special effects were also updated to appear better in high-definition.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=24344 |title=Kirk/Spock STAR TREK To Get All-New HD Spaceships |website=Aintitcool.com |accessdate=2009-08-22}}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DVDs are also facing competition from [[video on demand]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/are-dvds-becoming-obsolete.htm|title=Are DVDs becoming obsolete?|date=1 November 2014|website=Electronics.howstuffworks.com|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/forum/movie?_encoding=UTF8&amp;cdForum=Fx2E577OZX17PPI&amp;cdThread=TxQZAH1GWRJW8V|title=Amazon.com: Customer Discussions: When will DVDs be obsolete?|website=Amazon.com|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/dvd-sales-decline-study/|title=Is the DVD Becoming Obsolete?|publisher=ScreenCrush|last=Romano|first=Nick|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/DVD-Going-Way-VHS-2016-43349.html|title=DVD Going The Way Of VHS In 2016  - CINEMABLEND|date=6 June 2014|website=Cinemablend.com|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With increasing numbers of homes having high speed Internet connections, many people now have the option to either rent or buy video from an online service, and view it by streaming it directly from that service's servers, meaning that the customer need not have any form of permanent storage media for video at all. PWC predicts that online streaming revenue will overtake physical media sales revenue by 2018. Globally, the total combined revenue from over-the-top (OTT)/streaming services and broadcasters' video on demand (VOD) services is expected to grow at a CAGR of 19.9% to overtake physical home video revenue (the sale and rental of DVDs and Blu-ray discs) in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/global-entertainment-media-outlook/segment-insights/filmed-entertainment.jhtml|title=Filmed entertainment segment insights from the Entertainment &amp; Media Outlook: PwC|date=10 December 2012|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=28 October 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210211334/http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/global-entertainment-media-outlook/segment-insights/filmed-entertainment.jhtml|archivedate=10 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2017, digital streaming services had overtaken the sales of DVDs and Blu-rays for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/05/film-and-tv-streaming-and-downloads-overtake-dvd-sales-for-first-time-netflix-amazon-uk|title=Film and TV streaming and downloads overtake DVD sales for first time|first=Mark|last=Sweney|date=5 January 2017|accessdate=28 October 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Longevity ==
DVD longevity is measured by how long the data remains readable from the disc, assuming compatible devices exist that can read it: that is, how long the disc can be stored until data is lost. Numerous factors affect longevity: composition and quality of the media (recording and substrate layers), humidity and light storage conditions, the quality of the initial recording (which is sometimes a matter of mutual compatibility of media and recorder), etc.&lt;ref name="NIST-final"/&gt; According to [[NIST]], "[a] temperature of 64.4&amp;nbsp;°F (18&amp;nbsp;°C) and 40% RH [Relative Humidity] would be considered suitable for long-term storage. A lower temperature and RH is recommended for extended-term storage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Wo|last=Chang |url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/894.05/docs/disccare.html |title=NIST Digital Media Group: docs/disccare |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |date=2007-08-21 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Optical Storage Technology Association]] (OSTA), "Manufacturers claim lifespans ranging from 30 to 100 years for DVD, DVD-R and DVD+R discs and up to 30 years for DVD-RW, DVD+RW and DVD-RAM."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osta.org/technology/dvdqa/dvdqa11.htm|title=Understanding DVD - Disc Longevity|website=Osta.org|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a NIST/[[Library of Congress|LoC]] research project conducted in 2005–2007 using [[accelerated life testing]], "There were fifteen DVD products tested, including five DVD-R, five DVD+R, two DVD-RW and three DVD+RW types. There were ninety samples tested for each product. [...] Overall, seven of the products tested had estimated life expectancies in ambient conditions of more than 45 years. Four products had estimated life expectancies of 30–45 years in ambient storage conditions. Two products had an estimated life expectancy of 15–30 years and two products had estimated life expectancies of less than 15 years when stored in ambient conditions." The life expectancies for 95% survival estimated in this project by type of product are tabulated below:&lt;ref name="NIST-final"&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rt/NIST_LC_OpticalDiscLongevity.pdf Final Report: NIST/Library of Congress (LC) Optical Disc Longevity Study], Loc.gov, September 2007 (table derived from figure 7)&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|DVD lifetime|date=December 2013}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nominated Ami Harel as its CEO. This company was a pioneer in the developing Israeli communications market in the late 1980s and early 1990s, before the accelerated regulation of overseas voice and data communication. As the group grew, Goldstein formulated an investment strategy of specialization in software products and services for [[vertical market]]s. He acquired controlling interests in a number of young companies, such as ''Applicom'', a software house for [[Mini Computer]]s, ''Wiztech'', which specialized in Billing, and [[BluePhoenix|Crystal]], which specialized in large conversion projects. By 1990 Goldstein established the position of Formula Systems as a leading software group in Israel. He founded ''Foraz'', the first Israeli [[Venture Capital]] [[Funding|Fund]], together with ''Liraz'', a publicly traded company headed by Arik Kilman. Goldstein later acquired Liraz's share in the fund, and later acquired control of Liraz itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In the 1990s, Goldstein acquired other technology companies. He bought a Telecom billing company headed by Amos Sivan and changed its name to ''Formula Telecom Solutions'' '''(FTS)''', Acquired an insurance software company headed by Zeev Alon and renamed it ''Formula Insurance Solutions'' '''(FIS)''', a retail software company called "Az-Ben", which he renamed ''Formula Retail Solutions'' '''(FRS)''', and a Travel solutions company headed by Menahem Shaked, which he named ''Formula Travel Solutions''. He also acquired ''Nikuv Computers'', one of the first publicly traded software services companies in Israel specializing in Salary calculation, which owned a prevalent [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] system for small and medium clients. Throughout this decade, some of Goldstein's earlier investments have reached a size which justified public offerings, and raised funds on The [[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange]], the [[Alternative Investment Market|AIM]] market in [[London]], and on [[Nasdaq]]: [[BluePhoenix|Crystal Software Solutions]] and ''Wiztech'' (later wholly acquired by [[Convergys]]) were the first two greatly successful offerings, followed by [[w:he:מטריקס (חברה)|ForSoft]], the traditional Software Services arm of the group throughout the 90s. Goldstein's holding company, [[Formula Systems]] also started trading on [[Nasdaq]]. He also founded a new Venture Capital Fund, ''Formula Ventures'' headed by Shay Beilis, and acquired a controlling interest in [[Sapiens International Corporation|Sapiens]].{{cn|date=September 2014}}

==Acquisition of Mashov Group==
In 1998 Goldstein acquired control of the [[Mashov Group]]. This publicly traded group of technology companies headed by [[Yaki Dunietz]] and [[David Assia]], consisted of established businesses such as [[Magic Software Enterprises]], [[Babylon (program)|Babylon]], Paradigm Geophysical and [[Walla!]] Communications. This acquisition, combined with the effects of the [[technology bubble]] which resulted in high evaluations of technology companies, brought The Formula Group to evaluations exceeding a Billion Dollars. In February 2000, Goldstein led a secondary public offering of [[Magic Software Enterprises]] on [[Nasdaq]], raising over $100 Million, at a valuation of $750 million. During this period, Goldstein partnered and worked with major players in the world of finance, such as [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Citibank]], and all major Israeli investment banks, Mezzanine funds such as ''FIMI'', ''Shamrock'' (Disney's investment arm), ''Discount Investments'' and many more. By the end of the millennium, Goldstein was by far the most prominent technology-oriented [[entrepreneur]] in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In March 2000, one month after [[Magic Software Enterprises|Magic Software]]'s successful secondary offering for a record evaluation, the [[technology bubble]] started to burst. Apart from the companies included in the [[Mashov]] portfolio, Goldstein  was not heavily invested in the technology sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein decided to reorganize, and entirely changed the corporate structure of the group he controlled. He consolidated and simplified the complicated multi-level corporate structure, which was a half arbitrary result of many historical and fiscal reasons. Formula Systems remained the top level holding company, with 3 distinct holdings: [[w:he:מטריקס (חברה)|Matrix]] (formerly Forsoft), which merged and acquired all wholly owned group members which were synergetic with its business (including education companies such as ''John Bryce'' and ''Sivan'', hardware companies such as ''2D'', ''Syntech'', software companies such as ''Applicom''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Magic Software Enterprises]], and [[Formula Vision]] (formerly Mashov Computers). This reorganization also included sale of holdings (e.g., [[Walla!]] Communications and ''Paradigm Geophysical'', both mature holdings acquired with the [[Mashov Group]]) which were minority holdings, or not synergetic with other group activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Control of the Formula Group was transferred to ''Fimgold'', a partnership between Goldstein and the ''FIMI opportuniti fund'', headed by Ishay Davidi. This move was intended to "contribute to and upgrade the Company’s operations, help in the crystallization of the Company’s new strategy, and at the end of the day will add value to the Company’s shareholders".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed, Goldstein found himself leading a publicly traded corporate pyramid as well as group of young, promising yet struggling companies in the portfolio of Formula Vision. In 2006, he received an offer from [[w:he:אמבלייז|Emblaze]], another public company, run by Guy Bernstein. [[w:he:אמבלייז|Emblaze]] acquired Formula in December of that year, and Goldstein parted from the company he founded and managed for 25 years, in favor of a de facto start-up incubator, Formula Vision.{{cn|date=September 2014}}
==Public office==

Since 2000, Goldstein has been Chairman of The '''Public Companies Association''' in [[Israel]]. As such, he is very involved in legislation and public debate over issues pertaining to subjects such as [[corporate governance]], [[financial regulation]], reporting and [[accounting standards]]. He is a demanded speaker in panels, typically representing corporate business interests.

An '''elevator consultant''' is someone who specializes in the design, testing and maintenance inspection of [[elevator]]s, [[escalator]]s, [[moving walkway]]s and many other conveyances that move people. They are not to be confused with [[elevator mechanic]]s. Consultants (unlike mechanics) do not normally perform work on conveyances. Some elevator consultants may also work as private [[elevator inspector]]s. Some jurisdictions may accept independent third party inspectors for certified inspections while others may employ their own inspectors.

==Job duties==
Elevator consultants work for property owners, developers, building tenants, [[architect]]s, [[engineer]]s, municipal code enforcement bodies and insurance companies for the following purposes:
*Identifying elevator system options for Developers in order to create the most efficient transportation solution for a specific building.
*Designing elevator systems for Architects and Engineers, including elevator bank traffic studies, component specifications, and providing blueprint drawings for incorporation into contract bid packages.
*Performing ASME A17.1 QEI-1 certified inspections under the authority of the [[Municipal Code Enforcement Official]]s (in the USA).
*Providing maintenance audits to verify contract compliance with the maintenance provisions of the contract, confirming compliance with the ASME A17.1 maintenance provisions, and determining the long term viability of the equipment as required by the Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM) maintenance requirements.
* Enforcing Municipal code upon conveyances, ensuring the public's safety, although these inspections are frequently performed by elevator inspectors employed by or authorized by public entities.
*Expert testimony for lawsuits involving conveyances.

Elevator Consultants can be a helpful resource to those who are involved in the design of new buildings and the management of existing buildings. An Elevator Consultant will typically not perform work on a conveyance in order to ensure their independence. In some instances, they may be authorized to address serious hazards as part of their ethical responsibility to the public by removing a conveyance from service, until potential dangers can be addressed.

==Education background==
There are no specific university programs to train an Elevator Consultant, although many are trained in [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]] and [[electrical engineering]]. Many Elevator consultants are former employees of major manufacturers, but may have limited technical background in the design and construction of buildings. Elevator consultants most frequently gain skills through experience in a variety of conveyance-related work. A qualified Elevator Consultant should have specific experience in elevator construction and modernization, familiarity with model codes and standards, and familiarity with local building codes, laws and regulations. Some elevator consultants may also perform certified inspections, after qualifying and obtaining QEI-1 credentials in the States or [[Provinces]] where independent inspectors are authorized. (see [[elevator inspector]])

Although some elevator consultants may be certified as QEI Inspectors, verifying qualifications of a consultant can be difficult. One organization called the [[International Association of Elevator Consultants]], (IAEC) sets standards for experience and certification of independence, in order to become a member, which is intended to minimize concerns with the consultant's qualifications.

IAEC has recently made available a special certification, the Qualified Elevator Consultant, (QEC). There are currently 10 QECs in the world. Included in this list are representatives from the USA, Canada, and India. Requirements for attaining QEC certification are found in the IAEC bylaws and include, among other things, ten years of verifiable elevator consulting experience and extensive industry involvement.

Some elevator manufacturers may also employ trained staff in technical sales and support engineering departments to assist in the design of elevator and escalator systems. Elevator consultants however, are generally employed as independent contractors by architects, engineers or directly by property owners for large scale building projects involving multiple technical disciplines. A design team for a major building project will often require a specific technical design experience by professional consultants, such as a [[kitchen consultant]], [[lighting consultant]], [[audio-visual consultant]], [[landscape architect]], and/or am elevator consultant to supplement the technical work of the architect and engineer. It is expected by the Owner that these design teams will avoid using consultants that represent a specific manufacturer to minimize the potential, or even the appearance of a conflict of interest.

The demands of the [[real estate]] business have promoted the growth of the elevator consulting field, largely because one of the most expensive parts of the elevator is the space taken in the building. Careful design of the elevator system can both minimize the cost of elevators and improve the efficiency of the building. Elevators and escalators can add a substantial initial and long term investment to a building. A qualified independent elevator consultant is common in large campus type environments such as colleges, hotel chains and malls where standardization of materials and methods is desirable.

==Elevator inspector==
In general, elevator and escalator inspectors in the US and Canada are required to carry a current Qualified Elevator Inspector's (QEI) certification. In some jurisdictions, equivalent certification may be offered through State or Provincial authorities; however the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME) requires QEI certification as the sole standard for proof of qualification (See: ASME A17.1 Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators). Increasingly, US States are using authorized independent inspectors to perform periodic inspections, witnessing annual tests that in the past would have been the work of State employees. In many States, a list of qualified competitive inspection companies are made available to private property owners to select from.

QEI Certification is available from one of three organizations approved by the ASME. Qualification to obtain QEI certification includes extensive previous experience in the field of elevators (and other conveyances), experience working as an inspector and passing a comprehensive written examination. An application is available from the [[National Association of Elevator Safety Authorities]], maintaining current certification that includes meeting standards for continuing education, required to be renewed annually. The qualifications for QEI Inspectors and QEIS (inspector supervisors) and Certifying Organizations and performance standards for inspectors can be found in the ASME standard QEI-1 Standard for the Qualification of Elevators and Inspectors. Inspectors are required by the ASME standards to avoid situations that are considered unethical, such as conflicts of interest that include performing or witnessing inspections and test on conveyances that they or their employer have financial interest in. Inspections are performed using the ASME A17.2 Guide for Inspection of Elevators, Escalators and Moving Walks as well as other relevant reference standards and local building codes. In most cases, inspectors are required to verify that conveyances meet the standards that they were originally installed under, however some jurisdictions may require conveyances that meet more current standards, including US federal authorities that often require conveyances meeting the minimum standards of the ASME A17.3 Safety Code for Existing Elevators and Escalators. Additionally, all conveyances are required to meet current safety standards for maintenance and inspection regardless of the date of original installation.

ASME A17.1 Appendix N lists the recommended frequency for conveyance inspections and tests. Each Authority Having Jurisdiction has authority to determine the frequency for inspection in their jurisdiction. However, the [[International Code Council]], the most commonly adopted national standard for building codes in the US, adopts the recommended frequency of Appendix N in its entirety. In general, a QEI certified elevator inspector is required to perform a periodic inspection on passenger and freight elevators and escalators every six months. Additionally, each conveyance is required to have a series of safety tests completed annually by qualified elevator maintenance personnel (as defined by ASME A17.1). This test is required to be witnessed by a QEI inspector that does not have a personal financial interest in, or be employed by someone that has a financial interest in the results of the test. (This would be considered an unethical conflict of interest) In summary, most elevators, escalators, [[platform lift]]s and other conveyances that are permitted to carry people, are required to have two periodic inspections and one annual test each year. Additionally, all new and renovated elevators require an acceptance inspection and test to verify that any new or substantially modernized equipment conforms to the latest codes and standards.

Elevator Inspection Companies are Independent Contractors that are required to be authorized by the local, State or national authority having jurisdiction. (According to ASME A17.1) Standards for being approved for authorization generally include verification of independence, current certification and appropriate [[liability insurance]]. In most Jurisdictions that use independent inspectors, the authority having jurisdiction authorizes multiple inspection companies to avoid concerns with anti-trust lawsuits (see: Professional Ambulance Service, Inc. v. Abramowitz, 328 N.Y.S.2d 467). To protect the interests of the public, authorities are responsible to verify that an inspection company maintains current QEI certification for inspectors (as applicable), provides proper safety equipment to employees, carrying general liability, errors and omissions insurance prior to authorization.

Violations of elevator, escalator and other conveyance safety codes may involve civil damages to property owners, and may include liability claims if those violations include personal injuries. Property Owners may incur additional liability, including civil and criminal penalties if it can be proven that they failed to properly maintain and/or meet the State or Provincial requirements for inspections of their conveyances, particularly if those claims are made that indicate negligence.

Verification by Users of Conveyances of proof of current inspection is generally the right of the public. Certification processes vary widely across jurisdictions, but in general, the riding public has a right to demand proof that a conveyance available to the public has met the Jurisdiction's standards for current inspections. In States enforcing the ICC International Property Maintenance Code, that right is explicitly stated in section 606.1. Recent attempts to make those certifications more easily accessible to the public were blocked by building owner associations, however the property maintenance code is unambiguous about the right of the riding public to verify current certifications are maintained.

'''Filip Deutsch pl. Maceljski''' (born '''Freivel Benjamin Deutsch'''; March 16, 1828 &amp;ndash; May 6, 1919) was [[Croatian people|Croatian]] [[Nobility|nobleman]], industrialist who had a significant impact on the development of [[Turopolje]] near [[Velika Gorica]] and timber industry in that region.&lt;ref name="hz"&gt;{{harvtxt|Ivo Goldstein|2001|pp=188, 189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Knežević|first=Snješka|url=http://www.tportal.hr/kultura/kulturmiks/243828/Zidovi-u-Zagrebu-Prve-obitelji-i-prvaci.html|title=Židovi u Zagrebu: Prve obitelji i prvaci|publisher=T portal|date=2013-02-17|language=Croatian|archivedate=|deadurl=|archiveurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deutsch was born on March 16, 1828 to a [[Jews|Jewish]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ognjen Kraus|1998|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was married to Amalija ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Schwarz) Deutsch with whom he had three sons, Vilim, Albert and Benko. His sons later became notable Croatian industrialists and philanthropists. From early age Deutsch was active entrepreneur, in [[Zagreb]] he had a storage company for timber and firewood sale. In 1884 his company "Filip Deutsch i sinovi Zagreb" (''Filip Deutsch and sons Zagreb'') produced the columns for the [[Podsused - Vrapče|Podsused]] bridge. Deutsch bought, in 1910, 50 acres of land from the noble municipality Turopolje. On that land, in 1911, Deutsch founded the steam sawmill in Turopolje which he named "Paropilana Filipa Deutscha sinova". He immediately began to lift the objects for the sawmill, houses for workers and specialists which were brought from Zagreb and other Croatian regions. Houses were built in a rows and were called "Kolonija" (''The Colony''). In June 1911 Deutsch sawmill started to produce oak sawn wood, mostly from the Turopolje forest, with the capacity of 40,000 m3. Deutsch built and spread the sawmill as production expanded. He also built about 10 kilometers of railways for the Burdelj and Turopoljski lug. At the peak of success Deutsch sawmill employed about 600 workers. Deutsch workers were treated fairly with eight-hour working day, which was a rarity at the time, with supplied hot meals, decent salaries and housing for every worker. Deutsch was also a great philanthropist who often aided the poor. In Zagreb, twice a year, he would donated two to three wagons of wood during the winter. For his contribution on the development of Turopolje region Deutsch was awarded with the title ''pl.'' (plemeniti {{hr icon}} = noble {{en icon}}) ''Maceljski'' per [[Macelj]] forest.&lt;ref name="hz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ivo Goldstein|2005|pp=269, 270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Emilij Laszowski|2010|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} [[Croatian State Archives]]: HR-HDA-122, ''Plemenita općina Turopolje (fond) 1830 - 1947''&lt;/ref&gt;

Deutsch died in Zagreb on May 6, 1919. He was buried in the family crypt at the [[Mirogoj Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Gradska groblja Zagreb: Filip Deutsch, [[Mirogoj Cemetery|Mirogoj]] Ž-924-ARKP-1/1&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14829">'''Henry Charles Taylor''' (April 16, 1873 – April 28, 1969) was an American [[agricultural economics|agricultural economist]].  As an early pioneer in the field, he has been called the "father of agricultural economics" in the United States.&lt;ref name=ahs/&gt;  Taylor established the first university department dedicated to agricultural economics in the United States in 1909 during his time at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].  He also had a brief but very influential career in the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] from 1919 to 1925, where he helped reorganize its offices and became head of the new [[Bureau of Agricultural Economics]].  Coming from a rural farm community himself, Taylor's foremost goal was always to try to improve the living conditions of farmers.

==Early life==
Taylor was born in [[Iowa]] on a farm near [[Stockport, Iowa|Stockport]].  Growing up, he witnessed his father, Tarpley Taylor, expand his farm from about {{convert|60|acre|m2}} to {{convert|600|acre|km2}} by buying small farms from early settlers.  From an early age he was able to see how proper land and economic management reinforced each other.  Additionally, Taylor had been impacted by the depressions of the late 19th century, especially that of the 1890s, and what devastating effects they had on farmers.  He entered [[Drake University]] to do two years of preparatory work, then went on to [[Iowa State College]], where he received his B.S. in agriculture in 1896, then his M.S. in agriculture in 1898.  He then joined the University of Wisconsin–Madison to earn his Ph.D.  Taylor's original intention upon going to Wisconsin was to take up a career as a statesman in order to represent farmers.  However he soon realized that his economics study offered more than he was expecting.&lt;ref name=ch&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Kenneth Parsons|Parsons, Kenneth H.]] | date =June 1991 | title = Henry Charles Taylor, 1873-1969: Organizer and first head of the USDA's BAE | journal = Choices: The Magazine of Food, Farm &amp; Resource Issues | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | page = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Later in his career, he stated that "90 per cent of what could be done for the farmers was what they could do for themselves by adjusting production."&lt;ref name=uwp/&gt; Inspired by economics professor [[Richard T. Ely]], he left in 1899 to travel through Europe, briefly studying economics at the [[London School of Economics]] in Britain and at the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg]] and the [[University of Berlin]] in Germany.&lt;ref name=ahs&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jones, C. Clyde  |date=July 1958 | title = Henry C. Taylor: Father of Agricultural Economics (1873-) | journal = Agricultural History | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 196–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His doctoral dissertation was on "The Decline of Land Owners Farmers in England," which had him traveling by bicycle to visit more than a hundred farms.  Taylor returned to Wisconsin in 1901 to complete his degree in economics in 1902.&lt;ref name=uwp&gt;{{cite journal | author = Parsons, Kenneth H. |date=May 1970 | title = Henry Charles Taylor: A Personal Tribute by a Colleague | journal = Land Economics | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 191–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career at the University of Wisconsin–Madison===
He stayed on at the faculty of the University of Wisconsin until 1919.  Room was made for him in the Department of General Economics and the School of Commerce to teach economic geography and economic history.  However, as he later noted there was nothing in the budget to provide for his area of interest, agricultural economics.  Ely suggested that he simply teach the given courses and slowly develop work on agricultural economics.  Upon approaching the dean with the idea, he was told there would be no place for such courses for the next ten years.  Nevertheless, by the winter of 1902-03, Ely had arranged for fourteen lectures to be given to agricultural students on the economics of farm management.  The dean was impressed by the prepared syllabus and eventually Taylor set up an agricultural economics course for four-year students.  He devoted himself by 1903 to founding a Department of Agricultural Economics at the University for both research and teaching.  Taylor wrote the first agricultural economics textbook in the United States in 1905. He also adapted a dot map system with [[William Jasper Spillman|William J. Spillman]] to show historical shifts in agricultural production.&lt;ref name=uwp/&gt;

By 1909 he was successful in creating the new department, the first devoted to agricultural economics in the United States.&lt;ref name=uwp/&gt;  By this time he had also broadened the scope of the field to include [[rural sociology]].&lt;ref name=ahs/&gt;  In 1910 he authored the first Wisconsin Experiment Station bulletin on agricultural economics, on the ''Methods of Renting Farm Lands in Wisconsin''.&lt;ref name=bp/&gt;  Taylor also worked with the Wisconsin state government after being spurred on by [[Charles McCarthy (political scientist)|Charles McCarthy]], an advocate of cooperation between the government, farmers, and universities.  Wisconsin's new Department of Agriculture was asked to provide leadership in improving the marketing of dairy as the state was seeing a recent shift toward greater milk production.  Taylor used this as an opportunity to secure funding from the government to create a new faculty position for marketing.  For this, he invited his long-time friend and head of the Department of Economics at Iowa State College [[Benjamin Horace Hibbard]].  He joined the department in 1913 to become its second faculty member.&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;

Taylor was also a founding member of the Farm Management Association, which later became the [[Agricultural &amp; Applied Economics Association|American Farm Economic Association]].  He served as its president in 1920.&lt;ref name=ae&gt;{{cite journal | author = Unknown author |date=August 1969 | title = Henry C. Taylor | journal = American Journal of Agricultural Economics | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 732–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government career==
From 1909 to 1910 he assisted the Bureau of the Census to plan its schedule for the agricultural census, as well as for a special census of plantations.  Taylor chose to join the United States Department of Agriculture for the chance at giving a national role to agricultural economics, even though the new position meant a large reduction in salary.  He moved to [[Washington D.C.]] in 1919 to take charge of the USDA's Office of Farm Management and Farm Economics.  Not long after his arrival in Washington, the wartime prices of farm products collapsed, which proved disastrous for a great number of farmers.  In 1920, President Harding appointed [[Henry Cantwell Wallace|Henry C. Wallace]], who knew Taylor and was himself a great supporter of farmers, as the new Secretary of Agriculture.  Taylor soon became Chief of the Bureau of Markets and Crop Estimates, while also being part of a commission to reorganize the offices of the USDA.  For him this was a chance to consolidate the economics work of the department which had been scattered through many offices.  In 1922, Wallace appointed him chief of the new Bureau of Agricultural Economics, which subsumed the former Office of Farm Management and Bureau of Markets and Crop Estimates&lt;ref name=ahs/&gt; (today the [[Agricultural Research Service]] and [[Agricultural Marketing Service]]).  Among Taylor's tasks in the USDA were the expansion of agricultural information services, creating foreign outposts for the USDA to better collect information on world production and consumption, standardizing the grading of exported American crops, especially cotton, and inaugurating the Agricultural Outlook Service.&lt;ref name=bp&gt;{{cite journal | author = Penn, R. J. |date=December 1969 | title = Henry Charles Taylor, 1873-1969 | journal = American Journal of Agricultural Economics | volume = 51 | issue = 5 | pages = 999–1002 | doi = 10.1093/ajae/51.5.999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also brought many talented new people into the USDA.  Among them, two of his Ph.D. students he had already sent to work with Spillman, Oscar C. Stine and [[Oliver Edwin Baker]], and [[Lewis Cecil Gray]], who he persuaded to go with him to Washington.&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;

One of the major issues at the time was the controversy surrounding the first [[McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill]] in 1924 and other farmer subsidies proposals, however Taylor later stated his own involvement was only indirect.  The bill was not supported by the White House but had support from much of the Department of Agriculture.  Wallace died unexpectedly in late 1924, and Taylor had lost one of his greatest supporters.  President Coolidge appointed [[William Marion Jardine]] as the new Secretary of Agriculture in 1925.  Although he knew Taylor and they possibly were friends, Coolidge appointed Jardine on the condition that he get rid of Taylor.  Jardine asked him to step down and he would try to find him a government position of equivalent rank.  Taylor ignored the request and carried on his work, stating that he himself never actively supported the McNary-Haugen Bill or any other such program.  Taylor was dismissed from his post officially on August 15, 1925.&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;  Despite his short government career, he was still able to make major contributions to the Department of Agriculture, which had become one of the first great economic research organizations in the United States.&lt;ref name=ahs/&gt;&lt;ref name=uwp/&gt;  Disappointed by his termination, he went on to give speeches to farm groups, especially in Iowa, with the main message that Washington was more interested in providing cheap food to urban workers than the welfare of farmers.  Taylor wrote of his experience in government in 1926 in a 317-page manuscript called "A Farm Economist in Washington, 1919-1925."  Although intended to be released as a book to the public, it was never published.&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;

==Later life==
Taylor returned to his academic career, briefly rejoining Ely, then going to [[Northwestern University]] to work with the Institute for Research in Land Economics until 1928.  He then went to [[New England]] for three years to serve as Director of the Survey of Rural [[Vermont]].  Taylor then left the United States and traveled through Japan, China, Korea, and India as a member of the Commission of Appraisal of the Layman's Foreign Missions Inquiry for one year, in which he reviewed the work done by missionaries on rural problems.  He then went to Rome to serve as the United States member of the Permanent Committee of the International Institution of Agriculture between 1933 and 1935.&lt;ref name=ahs/&gt;&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;

He returned to the United States in 1935 on request from Illinois Governor [[Frank Lowden]] to serve as Managing Director of the recently created [[Farm Foundation]] in Chicago until 1945, where he focused on the broad problems of rural communities and worked to establish a relationship between researchers in the USDA and state agricultural colleges.&lt;ref name=bp/&gt;  He also worked closely with Oscar C. Stine on studying the history and development of agricultural economics.&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;  In 1936 he also served as president of the [[Agricultural History Society]], of which he was a life member.&lt;ref name=ae/&gt;  In 1945 he was transferred to Washington D.C. to serve as Agricultural Economist for the Farm Foundation.  This allowed him to devote himself to writing his book, ''The Story of Agricultural Economics'', with his wife Anne Dewees Taylor, and the foundation's sponsorship.  With its completion in 1952, Taylor began a study of land scarcity in highly industrialized nations like England, Germany, and Japan, and how their economies were adapting with the loss of their colonies.&lt;ref name=ahs/&gt;  He stayed active to the end of his life.  Taylor regularly attended the meetings of the International Conference of Agricultural Economists until he was 90, and also worked to complete a 100-year history of the original Taylor farm, Tarplewick, started by his parents in Iowa in 1861.&lt;ref name=uwp/&gt;

Even before his death he had become known as the "father of agricultural economics" in the United States.&lt;ref name=ahs/&gt;  However Taylor himself noted the pioneer work of five of his contemporaries in the field along with him: [[Andrew Boss]], [[William Jasper Spillman|William J. Spillman]], and [[George F. Warren]], from a background in [[agronomy]], and Benjamin H. Hibbard and  [[Thomas Nixon Carver]], who along with himself were students of Richard T. Ely in general economics.&lt;ref name=bp/&gt;  Taylor nonetheless embraced this role as a sort of elder statesman, and accepted many visitors to his home, including many young agricultural economists.  He found teaching to be the most rewarding part of his career.  Taylor was eventually hospitalized by bone cancer of the leg, a terminal illness, but even then continued to see visitors.&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;  He died in April 1969 at the [[Sibley Memorial Hospital]] in Washington.  He was survived by his daughter, Esther E. Taylor.&lt;ref name=ae/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8924">The '''human resource consulting''' industry has emerged from [[management consulting]] and addresses [[human resource management]] tasks and decisions. HR Consultants can fill two typical roles (1) Expert Resource Consultant (2) Process/People consultant. These two roles are defined by Steele F. (1975), Kubr,M. (1993, 1996); Niedereicholz (1996), Curnow-Reuvid (2003) and Kipping, K. and Clarck (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IEECA Journal|url=http://ieeca.org/journal/index.php/JEECAR/article/view/70/pdf|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Expert Resource Consultant'' suggests solutions based on expertise and experience and assists in the implementation. The role is very typical in information [[benchmarking]] and design consulting (see examples of actual design practices in the subsequent section below).

The ''Process/People consultant'' assists in searching for solutions with methods that facilitate and raise creativity of the client company so that they will be able to implement solutions themselves. The role is traditionally demonstrated by [[organizational development|organizational development and change]] consulting.

==Core fields in practice==
  
The following are core fields around which most human resource consultancies are based:

'''Employee engagement:''' measure [[employee engagement]] levels through surveys and interviews, define and improve performance in employee engagement and retention. While this area of HR consulting is necessarily broad, encapsulating total rewards strategy, employee performance management, leadership transformation, and organisation structure design,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hay Group: Employee Engagement Practice|url=http://www.haygroup.com/en/your-challenges/engaging-your-people/|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; most companies do have very specialised independent practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Towers Watson Rewards Practice|url=https://www.towerswatson.com/en/Services/our-solutions/rewards|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aon Hewitt Performance Management Service|url=http://www.aon.com/human-capital-consulting/hrbpo/performance_management_services.jsp|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Compensation:''' design and manage compensation programs related to basic salary, bonuses, and stock plans. [[job evaluation|Evaluation of positions]] and building of salary structures, bonus plans and stock plans for clients are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Towers Watson|url=https://www.willistowerswatson.com/en/press/2016/02/willis-towers-watson-launches-new-software-product-for-compensation-professionals|accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialisations are often based on employee types (e.g. [[Executive compensation consultants]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aon Hewitt|url=http://www.aon.com/human-capital-consulting/consulting/executive_compensation.jsp|accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sales compensation consultants]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Towers Watson|url=https://www.towerswatson.com/en/Services/our-solutions/sales-effectiveness-and-rewards|accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''Employee benefits:''' optimize benefit plan design and administration (inclusive of health-related benefits) by assessing competitiveness and effectiveness of benefit plans (analytics and design), and cost-effectiveness and quality of vendors (brokerage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Towers Watson (Health and Group Benefits)|url=https://www.towerswatson.com/en/Services/our-solutions/health-and-group-benefits|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercer Benefits Consulting and Brokerage|url=http://www.mercer.com/what-we-do/health-and-benefits/employee-benefits.html|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Actuarial and retirement:''' provide actuarial and administration services to manage cost and effectiveness of retirement programs, including [[Defined benefit pension plan|defined benefit]] and [[defined contribution]] plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercer Retirement services|url=http://www.mercer.com/what-we-do/wealth-and-investments/retirement-plan-admin.html|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mergers and acquisitions:''' conduct human capital due diligence, coordinate and administer cross-functional activities during execution, including [[payroll]] and [[Human resource management system|HR technology]]. Align organizational cultures and work styles during post-merger integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercer M&amp;A - HR DD|url=http://www.mercer.com/what-we-do/mergers-and-acquisitions/due-diligence.html|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercer Post-Merger Integration|url=http://www.mercer.com/what-we-do/mergers-and-acquisitions/post-merger-integration.html|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercer M&amp;A Project Management|url=http://www.mercer.com/what-we-do/mergers-and-acquisitions/project-management-office.html|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Talent mobility:''' Provides the insight and execution for full international expatriates (usually for executives) or local plus (partial-package expatriates), from pre-move informative guide, to post-move expat management program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mobility- Mercer|url=http://www.mercer.com/what-we-do/workforce-and-careers/talent-mobility.html|accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other services may also include legal counseling, global initiatives, investments consulting, and the implementation of human resource technologies to facilitate human capital management.

==Companies in the field==
Human resource consultancies vary in their ranges of services and sizes, with many consultants and academicians breaking off to form their own practices. In 2007, there were 950 human resource consultancies globally, constituting a USD $18.4 billion market.

As of 2015, Mercer, Towers Watson, Aon Hewitt, Hay Group, and Buck Consultants were referred to as the largest HR consulting firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale|url=http://ocs.yale.edu/sites/default/files/Explore_Consulting_Top_Consulting_Firms_0.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Christensen|first1=Jens|title=Digital Business|pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Big Three (management consultancies)|MBB]] and [[Big Four accounting firms|Big Fours]] may not have the largest HR Consulting practice, some of them are known to be among the best in this field. According to [[Vault.com]], a website that provides career information by industry and by Fortune 1000 company, the top 10 HR Consulting Firms to work for in 2017 are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vault.com 2017 Best Consulting Firms in Each Practice Area|url=http://www.vault.com/company-rankings/consulting/best-firms-in-each-practice-area/?sRankID=81|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''imm Cologne''' ('''&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;'''nternationale '''&lt;u&gt;m&lt;/u&gt;'''öbel'''&lt;u&gt;m&lt;/u&gt;'''esse) is an international, publicly open [[furniture]] [[trade show]] held at ''[[koelnmesse]]'' exhibition centre in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]], every year in January. 

The exhibition's primary focus is contemporary furniture and [[interior design]], but it also showcases innovative materials and [[fabric]]s and the latest [[architectural lighting design]] technology. Along the [[Salone del Mobile]] in [[Milan]], the imm Cologne is regarded as a leading market place for related industries, i.e. [[List of furniture designers|furniture designers]], [[List of furniture companies|furniture companies]], furniture retailers, [[architect]]s and [[interior designer]]s. The 2018 show had some 1,250 exhibitors and attracted over 125,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.press1.de/wrapper.cgi/www.press1.de/files/kmeigen_kmpresse_1516610308.pdf|title=final report imm cologne 2018 |author= |website=imm-Cologne.com|accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Cologne Furniture Fair is organised by the Verband der Deutschen Möbelindustrie e.V. and was first held in 1949. Since the late 90s, the City of Cologne stages several events in conjunction with imm, namely the Cologne Design Week and Interior Design Week. Other groups include Design Champs and the international D&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Design Talents, with workshops for both young design professionals and design students.

'''Kaikaku''' (改革), is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] for "radical change". In business, Kaikaku is concerned with making fundamental and radical changes to a [[Operations management#Production systems|production system]], unlike [[Kaizen]] which is focused on incremental minor changes. Both Kaizen and Kaikaku can be applied to activities other than production.

== Introduction ==

Kaikaku and Kaizen are concepts in Japanese production philosophy that relate to each other. Both have origins in the [[Toyota Production System]].

Kaikaku means a radical change, during a limited time, of a production system. 
Kaizen, on the other hand, is continuous minor changes of a certain area of a production system, often with the primary goal of solving team related problems. Kaizen is based on all employees involvement and individual activities generally reach an improvement of less than 20%. 
A cross between Kaikaku and Kaizen is Kaizen Blitz (or Kaizen Events), which implies a radical improvement in a limited area, such as a production cell, during an intense week.

Kaikaku means that an entire business is changed radically, normally always in the form of a project. Kaikaku is most often initiated by management, since the change as such and the result will significantly impact business. Kaikaku is about introducing new knowledge, new strategies, new approaches, new production techniques or new equipment. Kaikaku can be initiated by external factors, e.g. new technology or market conditions. Kaikaku can also be initiated when management see that ongoing Kaizen work is beginning to stagnate and no longer provides adequate results in relation to the effort. Kaikaku projects often result in improvements in the range of 30-50% and a new base level for continued Kaizen. Kaikaku may also be called System Kaizen.

Kaikaku projects can be of four different types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuji Yamamoto| title = KAIKAKU An inspirational and Introduction [In Swedish] | location = Eskilstuna, Sweden | publisher = Malardalen University | year=2010|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Locally innovative - Capital intensive 
: E.g. an installation of robot automation in a factory is not new to the industry in general, but may be new to the company. The decision is strategically grounded and could mean higher costs 
* Locally innovative - Operation close
: E.g. the introduction of conventional methods [[Six Sigma]] or [[Total productive maintenance|TPM]] may be new to the company. The direct cost is relatively small 
* Radically innovative - Capital intensive 
: E.g. the introduction of a new and innovative production technology 
* Radically innovative - Operation close
: E.g. the introduction of new and innovative production solutions that are new to the industry

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20058">'''Lean thinking''' is a business methodology that aims to provide a new way to think about how to organize human activities to deliver more benefits to society and value to individuals while eliminating waste. The term ''lean thinking'' was coined by James P. Womack and Daniel T. Jones&lt;ref name="Lean Thinking"&gt;Womack, James P., Daniel, T. Jones (1996) Lean Thinking&lt;/ref&gt; to capture the essence of their in-depth study of Toyota’s fabled [[Toyota Production System]].&lt;ref name="TPS"&gt;Womack, James P., Daniel T. Jones, Daniel Roos (1990) The Machine That Changed The World&lt;/ref&gt; Lean thinking is a way of thinking about an activity and seeing the waste inadvertently generated by the way the process is organized. It uses the concepts of:

# Value
# Value streams
# Flow
# Pull
# Perfection

The aim of lean thinking is to create a lean enterprise, one that sustains growth by aligning customer satisfaction with employee satisfaction, and that offers innovative products or services profitably while minimizing unnecessary over-costs to customers, suppliers and the environment. The basic insight of lean thinking is that if you train every person to identify wasted time and effort in their own job and to better work together to improve processes by eliminating such waste, the resulting enterprise will deliver more value at less expense while developing every employee’s confidence, competence and ability to work with others.

The idea of lean thinking gained popularity in the business world and has evolved in two different directions:

# Lean thinking converts who keep seeking to understand how to seek dynamic gains rather than static efficiencies. For this group of thinkers, lean thinking continuously evolves as they seek to better understand the possibilities of the way opened up by Toyota and have grasped the fact that the aim of continuous improvement is continuous improvement. Lean thinking as such is a movement of practitioners and writers who experiment and learn in different industries and conditions, to lean think any new activity.
# Lean manufacturing adepts who have interpreted the term “lean” as a form of operational excellence and have turned to company programs aimed at taking costs out of processes. Lean activities are used to improve processes without ever challenging the underlying thinking, with powerful low-hanging fruit results but little hope of transforming the enterprise as a whole. This “corporate lean” approach is fundamentally opposed to the ideals of lean thinking, but has been taken up by a great number of large businesses seeking to cut their costs without challenging their fundamental management assumptions.

== Overview ==

Lean thinking was born out of studying the rise of Toyota Motor Company from a bankrupt Japanese automaker in the early 1950s to today’s dominant global player. At every stage of its expansion, Toyota remained a puzzle by capturing new markets with products deemed relatively unattractive and with systematically lower costs while not following any of the usual management dictates. In studying the company firsthand it appeared that it had a unique group of elders (sensei) and coordinators (trainers from Japan) dedicated to help managers think differently. Contrarily to every other large company, Toyota’s training in its formative years was focused on developing people’s reasoning abilities rather than pushing them to execute specialist-derived systems.

These “sensei”, or masters in lean thinking would challenge line managers to look differently at their own jobs by focusing on:
# '''The workplace''': Going and seeing firsthand work conditions in practice, right now, and finding out the facts for oneself rather than relying on reports and boardroom meeting. The workplace is also where real people make real value and going to see is a mark of respect and the opportunity to support employees to add value through their ideas and initiative more than merely make value through prescribed work. The management revolution brought by lean thinking can be summed up by describing jobs in terms of Job = Work + [[Kaizen]]
# '''Value through built-in quality''': Understanding that customer satisfaction is paramount and is built-in at every step of the enterprise’s process, from building in satisfying features (such as peace of mind) to correctly building in quality at every production step. Built-in quality means to stop at every doubtful part and to train yourself and others not to pass on defective work, not to do defective work and not to accept defective work by stopping the process and reacting immediately whenever things go wrong.
# '''Value streams through understanding "[[Takt time|takt" time]]''': By calculating the ratio of open production time to averaged customer demand one can have a clear idea of the capacity needed to offer a steady flow of products. This “takt” rhythm, be it a minute for cars, two months for software projects or two years for a new book leads to creating stable value streams where stable teams work on a stable set of products with stable equipment rather than optimize the use of specific machines or processes. Takt time thinking leads to completely different capacity reasoning than traditional costing and is the key to far more frugal processes.
# '''Flow through reducing batch sizes''': Every traditional business, whether in production or services, is addicted to batch. The idea as that once work is set up one way, we’d better get on and quickly make as many pieces of work as we can to keep the unit cost down. Lean thinking looks at this differently in trying to optimize the flow of work in order to satisfy real demand now, not imaginary demand next month. By working strenuously on reducing change-over time and difficulty, it is possible to approach the lean thinking ideal of single piece flow. In doing so, one reduces dramatically the general cost of the business by eliminating the need for warehouses, transports, systems, subcontractor use and so on. 
# '''Pull to visualize takt time through the flow''': pulling work from upstream at takt time through visual devices such as Kanban cards is the essential piece that enables lean thinkers to visualize the gaps between the ideal and the actual at the workplace at any time. Pull is what creates a creative tension in the workplace by both edging closer to single-piece-work and by highlighting problems one at a time as they occur so complex situations can be resolved piecemeal. Pull is the basic technique to “lean” the company and, by and large, without pull there is no lean thinking.
# '''Seeking perfection through kaizen''': The old time sensei used to teach that the aim of lean thinking was not to apply lean tools to every process, but to develop the kaizen spirit in every employee. Perfection is not sought through better, more clever systems or go-it-alone heroes but through a commitment to improve things together step-by-small-step. Kaizen literally means change for the better and Kaizen spirit is about seeking a hundred 1% improvements from every one every day every where rather than one 100% leap forward. The practice of kaizen is what anchors deep lean thinking in people’s minds and which, ultimately, leads to complete transformation. Practicing kaizen together builds self-confidence and the collective confidence that we can face our larger challenges and solve our problems together.

== Lean thinking practices ==

Experience shows that adopting lean thinking requires abandoning deeply engrained mainstream management thought routines, and this is never easy. The three main ways to adopt lean thinking are, unsurprisingly:
# “Aha!” moments by seeing someone behave in a striking way, or hitting upon a new idea by reading a book, visiting a workplace, or being beaten over the head by an old time sensei. Aha! moments are powerful, but unfortunately rare, and need the right conditions to occur.
# Every day practice by the daily use of “lean” practices. These practices mainly originate from Toyota and are essentially “think with your hand” exercises. Their purpose is not to implement new processes (as they are too often interpreted) but practical activities to lead one to see the situation differently and have new ideas about it – to adopt a leaner way of thinking.
# Joining lean self-study groups by practicing kaizen with others and identifying which role models one would like to follow. The lean community is now a generation strong and has many great examples to offer to any lean learner, whether beginner or experienced. Workplace visits with experienced lean thinkers remains one of the most effective ways to grasp their meaning.

In the lean thinking tradition, the teacher should not explain but demonstrate – learning is the full responsibility of the learner. However, to create the proper conditions for learning the lean tradition has adopted a number of practices from Toyota’s own learning curve. The aim of these practices is not to improve processes per se but to create an environment for teachable and learnable moments.

# '''Kaizen activities''': Whether cross-functional workshops, team quality circles, individual suggestions, and many other exercises, kaizen activities are about scheduled moments to improve the work within the normal working day. The point of kaizen is that improvement is a normal part of the job, not something to be done “when there is time left after having done everything else.” Kaizen is scheduled, planned, and controlled by a teacher who makes sure Dr. Deming’s  Plan-Do-Check-Act is followed rigorously.
# '''Kanban''': [[Kanban]] is the foundational practice of lean thinking (the Toyota Production System used to be first known as the Kanban system). Any process will have different output. For instance, nowadays, a writer will produce books, keynote speeches, blog posts, tweets and answer e-mails. The question is, at the present time right now, how can the person using the process know whether they are doing what is needed for customers right now or whether they are working ahead on something not that important and lagging behind on something critical. In project management this creates segments ahead and segments late, and end of project panic. In production this creates entire warehouses of inventories to compensate for the inability to produce right now what is needed. Kanban is a simple technique using cards or post-it notes to visualize “leveled” (i.e. averaged to avoid peaks and troughs) activity at the process. The writer will start a new book when she’s delivered one. She will worry about the new conference when it’s time to. She will write a new blog post at a steady rhythm rather than publish five in a rush and then one and so on. In production, Kanban cards make sure employees are working on what is needed right now and not overproducing parts which will then linger in inventory whilst others will be unavailable. Kanban is the main practice to reveal all misfits between today’s activities and how the market behaves. Kanban teaches one lean thinking by constantly challenging assumptions about market behavior and our own flexibility.
# '''Autonomation''': In any contemporary setting, every one uses either machines or software to do any work. Yet, this automated work still requires specific human judgments to be done right. As a result, many machines can’t be left alone to work because they’re likely to go wrong if someone doesn’t watch them all the time. Autonomation is the practice of progressively imparting human judgement to a system so that it self-monitors and stops and calls a human when it feels it went wrong, just as a desktop computer will flag a virus alert if it feels under attack. Autonomation is essential to separate people from machines and not have humans doing machine work and vice versa. Automation teaches lean thinking by revealing new ways of designing lighter, smarter machines with less capital expenditure.
# [[Andon (manufacturing)|Andon]]: Calling out when something feels out of kilt and to visualize that call on central board so that help can come quickly. Lean thinking is thinking together and no employee should be left alone with a problem. Andon is a critical system to be able to train employees in the details of their jobs within their own operations. Andon teaches lean thinking in highlighting the immediate barriers to the lean goal of zero defect at every step of the process at all time. Through andon it is possible to think better about training people and improving their work conditions to take all difficulties away.
# '''SMED''': Originally known as Single Minute Exchange of Die (changing tools under 10 minutes), SMED is a key lean thinking practice to focus directly on flexibility. Flexibility is central to flow and always a problem, even for an engineers’ mind – how flexible are we to move from one topic to the next? Flexibility doesn’t mean changing everything all the time, but the ability to switch quickly from one known activity to the next. SMED teaches lean thinking in always seeking to improve flexibility until one reaches true single-piece-flow in the right sequence to respond to instant customer demand.
# '''Standardized Work''': Lean thinking is about seeking the smoothest flow in any work, in order to see problems one by one and resolve them one by one, thus improving both the flow of work and the autonomy of the person. Standardized Work is the graphic description of this smooth flow of work at takt time with zero or one piece of work-in-process and clear location for everything and steps. Tricky quality points are also identified clearly, to make sure the person visualizes first, what is important for the customer, how to distinguish OK from not OK at every step and have to move confidently from one step to the next. Standardized work teaches lean thinking by visualizing every obstacle to smooth work each person encounters and highlighting topics for kaizen.
# '''Visualization''': Most lean thinking techniques are about visualization in some form or other so that we can see together, know together and thus learn together. Visual control is the essential trigger to creative problem solving as all can see the gap between what was planned and what actually happened and can seek both immediate countermeasures and root causes. Visualization teaches lean thinking by getting people to work together on their own problems and develop their responsibility to reaching objectives without overburden.

== Controversies ==

There are two controversies surrounding the word “lean,” one concerning the image of lean with the general public and the other within the lean movement itself.

Lean has repeatedly been accused of being a form of turbo-charged [[Taylorism]], the harbinger of productivity pressure, detrimental to employee’s health and autonomy at work. Unfortunately, some company programs calling themselves “lean” have indeed had a severely negative effect on the business and work relations. This problem arises when senior leaders do not seek to adopt lean thinking but instead delegate to outside consultants or internal specialist team the job of “leaning” processes. Lean thinking very clearly states that it seeks cost reductions – finding the policy origins of unnecessary costs and eliminating at the cause – and not cost cutting – forcing people to work within reduced budgets and degraded conditions in order to achieve line by line cost advantage. There is no doubt about this, but to many managers the latter option is far more expedient than the former and it’s easy to call “lean” a cost cutting program. Nonetheless, this is not that, and any approach that doesn’t have the explicit aim to develop lean thinking in every employee should not be considered to be “lean.”

A second ongoing controversy, within the lean community itself, concerns how closely lean thinkers should follow Toyota practices. This is a tricky subject because on the one hand Toyota is the inventor of lean and is well ahead in both knowledge and experience but, on the other hand, why would methods invented by a Japanese auto manufacturer apply anywhere else? In fact, this debate rests on the assumption that Toyota is a monolithic company with a single unified practice. In actual terms, Toyota has changed considerably from its 1970s roots and is now a global company with hundreds of sites across all continents – no two sites are alike and although there are similar principles at work, local practices vary considerably from site to site. No one comes out of any conversation completely unchanged and, for instance, in talking to GE one comes back GE-fied as in talking to Toyota, one comes back Toyota-fied, so to speak. This debate is thus vital for the lean movement as confronting Toyota practices, such as they are here and there, to other environments is the starting point of lean thinking. In this respect, “how much like Toyota thinking should lean thinking be?” is a question without an answer that merits constant, case by case consideration.

== It’s about people first ==

These controversies largely emerge around the radical organizational innovation proposed by lean thinking: putting people first rather than systems. In this, lean thinking departs markedly from mainstream management:
# Individual customers rather than market segments: Without denying the need to think in terms of segments, lean thinking is about taking seriously every single customer complaint and opinion of the product or service, as a fact. The ability to service every customer specifically is only limited by the flexibility of the company’s process and lean thinking is about seeking a way to reach the ideal of serving each individual’s preferences.
# Teaching employees how to learn rather than telling them what to do: Lean thinking’s aim is to develop each person’s autonomy in problem solving by supporting them in their continuous improvement activities. This is a radical break from Taylorism where a group of specialists will devise the “one-best-way” and line management will be tasked to enforce it. By contrast, lean thinking is taught to managers so that they help their own direct reports to think lean and reduce overburden, unneeded variation and activity waste by working more closely with their teams and across functional boundaries.

Lean thinking at senior level creates leaner enterprises because sales increase through customer satisfaction with higher quality products or services, because cash improve as flexibility reduces the need for inventories or backlogs, because costs reduce through identifying costly policies that create waste at value-adding level, and because capital expenditure is less needed as people themselves invent smarter, leaner processes to flow work continuously at takt time without waste.

== Lean and green ==

The import of lean thinking goes way beyond improving business profitability. In their seminal book Natural Capitalism, authors Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and L. Hunter Lovins explicitly reference lean thinking as a way to sustain growth without so much collateral damage for the environment. Indeed, lean thinking’s approach to seek to eliminate waste in the form of muri (overburden), mura (unlevelness) and muda (unnecessary resource use) is a proven practical way to attack complex problems piece by piece through concrete action. Indeed, Toyota industrial sites are well known for their sustainability efforts and well ahead of the “zero landfill” goal – all waste recycled within the site. Practicing lean thinking offers a radically new way to look at traditional goods and service production to learn how to sustain the same benefits at a much lower cost, financially and environmentally.

The '''Mackay Trophy''' is awarded yearly by the [[United States Air Force]] for the "most meritorious [[flight]] of the year" by an Air Force person, persons, or organization.  The trophy is housed in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasm.si.edu/research/aero/trophy/mackay.cfm Smithsonian Mackay Trophy Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901071348/http://www.nasm.si.edu/research/aero/trophy/mackay.cfm |date=2006-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The award is administered by the U.S. [[National Aeronautic Association]].

The award was established on 27 January 1911 by [[Clarence Mackay]], who was then head of the Postal Telegraph-Cable Company and the [[Commercial Cable Company]]. Originally, aviators could compete for the trophy annually under rules made each year or the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] could award the trophy for the most meritorious flight of the year.

Captain James A Yule, distinguished himself by gallantry and unusual presence of mind while participating in an aerial flight as an instructor pilot of a B-52D aircraft on 19 May 1976. Captain Yule’s flight developed a unique multiple emergency and he assumed command of the aircraft, and at great personal risk, checked out the hydraulic open wheel well area to detect the problem. Using initiative, he coordinated with ground agencies and crew members and determined that a safe landing could be made after loss of braking and complete failure of steering. Captain Yule’s professional competence and outstanding airmanship under extreme stress resulted in successful recovery of the crew and a valuable aircraft. His courageous acts in landing a malfunctioning aircraft reflect great credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.

On that date Knife 04 was chalk two on a short notice tasking for an urgent personnel recovery mission behind enemy lines. Due to severe weather along the route and a radar malfunction in the lead aircraft, Knife 04 assumed lead in an attempt to get the formation clear of the weather. While flying through the blinding weather, the two aircraft lost sight of one another. As Knife 04 tried to relocate their wingman, they lost radio contact. Contacting airborne command and control assets, Knife 04 confirmed that the other aircraft was on the ground. Several attempts to reach the downed crewmembers that had sustained injuries and were now exposed to subzero temperatures and enemy ground forces were unsuccessful. Knife 04 began coordinating the first of four aerial refuelings and initiated on scene command responsibilities while evading bad weather and taking enemy ground fire. As the weather cleared, Knife 04 located the crash site and began an approach to the rugged area.  The extremely slim power margin forced them to dump all but the very minimum fuel required for the approach. After a perilous landing, the downed aircrew were brought aboard. The takeoff in blinding snow with rotor speed decreasing to dangerous levels was accomplished through superior effort and ability from the crew. During the egress from hostile territory, Knife 04 was forced to aerially refuel several times as the minimum power margin prohibited their loading all of the required fuel in one engagement.

|| [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]] pilot Captain Markle was diverted to support [[special forces]] troops along the [[Afghanistan]]-[[Pakistan]] border in contact with [[Taliban]] forces.  He arrived just before dawn and heavy gunfire and [[Tracer ammunition|tracers]] and poor visibility made it difficult to find the team's location.  Captain Markle, unable to employ weapons due to the enemy's close proximity to the team, flew a dangerously low pass over the area while releasing self-protection [[Flare (countermeasure)|flares]].  When flares momentarily halted enemy fire.  The ground controller requested a few more close passes to the special forces team time to create more distance between themselves and the Taliban.  The seporation allowed Captain Markle to strafe the enemy area with more than 1,000 [[GAU-8 Avenger|30 millimeter]] rounds on his final pass.  The special forces team was able to disengage with no casualties.  Captain Markle was credited with destroying three [[machine gun]] nests and killing 40 enemy combatants.

|| Confronting a two hundred-strong enemy force that was attempting to overrun their base, the Joint Terminal Attack Controller requested a two thousand pound guided weapon. When the crew of BONE 23 realized friendly forces were in Danger Close range, they suggested a five hundred pound guided weapon, instead.  Faced with a critical fuel situation, the crew coordinated to move their tanker closer providing more time on station and, within thirty minutes, BONE 23 accomplished three bomb runs decisively slowing the enemy attack, allowing coalition forces to regroup.

Three Soldiers had been wounded near [[Forward Operating Base]] Frontenac when their convoy was hit with an [[improvised explosive device]] and became engaged by enemy combatants. During the recovery operation "Pedro 15" was downed by enemy fire, injuring the crew.  "Pedro 16", along with Army [[OH-58 Kiowa]]s, suppressed enemy fire.  Captain Rosebrough developed a plan to evacuate all the wounded personnel aboard "Pedro 16" and two Kiowa helicopters.  Their efforts ensured the recovery of the six "Pedro 15" crew members and three wounded soldiers.

|The aircrew of the Pacific Air Forces` Ironhand 41 flight, orchestrated four flawless attacks during an eight-hour night, flying F-16Cs over 500 miles in enemy-controlled terrain.  Their attacks destroyed three Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) blockades, multiple armored vehicles, one observation post, and killed ISIL fighters who were firing upon 40,000 trapped Yazidi civilians who had fled to Mount Sinjar.  Their outstanding battle management caused the cessation of ISIL indirect fires on civilians, ended ISIL freedom of movement around Mount Sinjar, facilitated the evacuation corridor by reducing pressure on Peshmerga ground forces, and ultimately saved the lives of 40,000 civilians including women, children, elderly, and the infirm.

|On July 26, 2015, United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Cohen, Major Seth Taylor, Captain Danielle Kangas, and Captain Mathew Park, arrived on scene over Hassekah, a major city in northeast Syria, where friendly Syrian Kurdish ground units were battling the last significant holdout of a group of Islamic State enemy personnel.  A firefight in the southeast portion of the city had erupted, pinning Kurdish ground units in a dense urban city block.  Overcoming targeting complicated by weather and limited communications, Lieutenant Colonel Cohen and Major Taylor expertly coordinated and employed several successful munitions in support of Kurdish forces despite highly restrictive attack parameters. Captain Kangas and Captain Park tracked and executed an effective attack on fleeing enemy soldiers wearing blankets to reduce their infrared signature.  In a four-hour period, the crews of WEASEL 41 and WEASEL 51 flight employed 15 precision guided munitions, destroying eight enemy fighting positions, with no friendly or civilian casualties. This marked the end of a three-month operation in Northern Syria that resulted in friendly Kurdish forces retaking over 17 thousand square kilometers of territory, securing the Syria/Turkey border between Iraq and the Euphrates River.

After the crew of SPOOKY 43 arrived overhead, the combined American and Afghan special operations force (also referred to as “friendlies”) was caught in a deadly ambush by a large insurgent force.  The friendlies were engaged by small arms, heavy machine gun, and grenade fire from multiple defensive fighting positions.  The crew of SPOOKY 43 provided close air support to the friendly ground force with the 25, 40, and 105-millimeter guns, to allow the them the freedom to maneuver and provide care for casualties.  In order to protect the ground team from enemy personnel, the crew of SPOOKY 43 expertly employed the 105-millimeter gun at an unprecedented 12 meters from the friendly personnel.  Due to the outstanding airmanship and bravery under extremely challenging circumstances, SPOOKY 43 destroyed 10 defensive fighting positions, 27 enemy insurgents, and three enemy technical vehicles, saving the lives of 50 combined American and Afghan special operations forces personnel who would have otherwise perished in the enemy ambush. The professional ability and outstanding aerial accomplishments of the crew of SPOOKY 43 reflect credit upon themselves and the United States Air Force.

Ltd" which was absorbed into [[Ravensdown Fertiliser Co-operative]]. His business interests were equally strong, from being instrumental in the founding of the Ravensdown fertiliser co-operative (1977–1982) to his association with [[Auckland]]'s highly successful Sky City casino as a director. He was knighted in the [[1988 Birthday Honours|1988 Queen's Birthday Honours]] for services to agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enzt.co.nz/~enztweb/halloffame/2004/hof2004a.htm New Zealand Business Hall of Fame&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101103223/http://www.enzt.co.nz/~enztweb/halloffame/2004/hof2004a.htm |date=2008-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Institute of Directors]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iod.org.nz/Home/Member_Lists/Distinguished_Fellows.aspx Distinguished Fellows list of the Institute of Directors]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elworthy had two brothers, [[Jonathan Elworthy]], a New Zealand politician, and [[David Elworthy (publisher)|David Elworthy]], a publisher. Their father was Herbert Elworthy, a son of [[Edward Elworthy]].

==Hobbies==

Elworthy owned a Tiger Moth aeroplane which he used to fly around New Zealand.

==Death==

In January 2004, Elworthy died suddenly of a [[heart attack]] early in the morning on the way to the bathroom.

He is survived by his wife Fiona Elworthy, 2 sons (Forbes and [[Charles Elworthy (scientist)|Charles]]) and 2 daughters(Josephine and Eve).

'''Piero Dusio''' (13 October 1899 – 7 November 1975) was an Italian soccer player, businessman and racing driver.&lt;ref name="museo"&gt;Donatella Biffignandi, ''[http://www.museoauto.it/website/images/stories/articoli/biografie/dusio_piero.pdf Piero Dusio]'' from museoauto.it, an online museum for automotive issues, last accessed on November 12, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Dusio was born at [[Scurzolengo]], [[province of Asti]]. His active soccer career (three games for [[Juventus]] 1921–22)&lt;ref&gt;[http://juworld.net/giocatori-scheda.asp?idgiocatore=142&amp;ty=tabvps Piero Dusio] soccer statistics at juworld.net, last accessed November 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; ended in a knee injury, after which he started a textile business (oil cloth), which evolved into sporting goods as well as becoming supplier of military uniforms.  He led the ''Juventus Organizzazione Sportiva Anonima'' (O.S.A.) 1941 to 1943, which became part of the [[Cisitalia]] firm in 1944, and even was president of [[Juventus]] from 1942 to 1948.

[[Image:Coppa asti spumante 1947.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Cisitalia]] D46 was named after Piero Dusio (the ''Dusio 46''). The racecar driver is [[Ilario Bandini]].]]

He raced in the [[Mille Miglia]] (1929–38), was sixth in [[1936 Italian Grand Prix]], winning a class victory (50th overall) in [[Mille Miglia]] in a [[Siata]] 500cc (1937), and formed the Scuderia Torino (1939).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicracing.com/ historicracing.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sporting-to.com/eng/storia.lasso sporting-to.com.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509125628/http://www.sporting-to.com/eng/storia.lasso |date=May 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He commissioned [[Dante Giacosa]] of [[Fiat]] to develop a racing car (1944), and formed the "Consorzio Industriale Sportiva Italia" (1944). The firm became [[Cisitalia]] and involved [[Carlo Abarth]], [[Rudolf Hruska]] and [[Ferry Porsche]].  Three D46's topped the local ''Coppa Brezzi'' (held with the [[1946 Turin Grand Prix]]), Dusio taking 1st.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.formula2.net/V46_8.htm |title=Coppa Brezzi 1946 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dusio continued financing racing car projects, but the expenses in engineering the complex [[Cisitalia#Cisitalia 202 MM|202MM]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeancarweb.com/features/0210ec_piero_dusio_cisitalia/ Piero Dusio &amp; the Cisitalia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110142406/http://www.europeancarweb.com/features/0210ec_piero_dusio_cisitalia/ |date=November 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; almost ruined Cisitalia (1947), as well as involved the Juventus corporation. Consequently, Dusio moved to [[Argentina]] and established [[Autoar]] (Automotores Argentinos) S.A.I.C. (22 March 1949),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auto-historia.com.ar/Historias/Autoar%20Historia.htm Autoar Historia]&lt;/ref&gt; financially supported by [[Juan Peron]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forix.com/8w/rear-engines-postwar.html forix.com]&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Carlo Dusio]] continued to run a refinanced [[Cisitalia]] company in [[Torino]] (1948–1964).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vea.qc.ca/vea/marques1/cisitalia.htm Cisitalia].&lt;/ref&gt;

Dusio tried but failed to qualify for one [[Formula One]] World Championship Grand Prix ([[1952 Italian Grand Prix|Italy 1952]]) with a [[Cisitalia]] D46, but he failed to set a time in practice due to engine problems. He raced in the [[Buenos Aires Grand Prix (motor racing)|Buenos Aires Grand Prix]] in 1954, and also started Cisitalia Argentina Industrial y Comercial SA, planning cars such as the [[Cisitalia 750]] (1960).

He died at [[Buenos Aires]] in 1975.

'''Ralph Thompson''' (born 1928), is a [[Jamaica]]n businessman, educational activist, artist and poet.

== Life and business career ==
Ralph Thompson was born in [[Poughkeepsie, NY]], to a Jamaican mother and [[US]] father, but the marriage lasted only three years, and from 1931 Thompson and his sister were raised in [[Jamaica]]. His mother's family, "a mixture of crypto Jewish (Isaacs) and Irish stock (Fielding)", was "staunchly Catholic and claimed to be white".&lt;ref&gt;"About the author", in Ralph Thompson, ''View from Mount Diablo'' (Leeds: [[Peepal Tree Press]], 2003), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated by [[Jesuits]] both at St George's College in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] and at [[Fordham University]] in New York, where he earned a Doctor of Law degree in 1952. After graduation he served for two years as an officer in the [[United States Air Force]], principally in [[Japan]], but returned to Jamaica in 1953, married a Jamaican, Doreen Lyons, in 1954, and has since lived in Kingston with his wife and children save for a brief period in the 1970s.

Thompson's business career was initially in property development with Abe Issa, the "father of Jamaican tourism", then independently. After his return to Jamaica he was deeply involved in governmental redevelopment of agriculture, and in 1988 was appointed a Commander of Distinction by the administration of [[Edward Seaga]]. His last major post was as CEO of Seprod Ltd, a large Jamaican manufacturing firm supplying household products and consumer goods for the local market.

Thompson is also a noted educational activist, speaking on radio and TV, and frequently writing for ''[[Jamaica Gleaner|The Gleaner]]'' and ''[[The Jamaica Observer]]''. He is also an amateur painter, and has publicly exhibited several times in Kingston; a selection of his paintings was published by [[Peepal Tree Press]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacqueline Bishop]] (ed.), ''Writers Who Paint / Painters Who Write: Three Jamaican Artists'' (Leeds: Peepal Tree Press, 2007), pp. 32–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poetry ==
During his residence in Florida in the late 1970s Thompson took a Masters in English Literature at the [[University of South Florida]], submitted some poems as part of an assignment, and was encouraged to publish them. He began to write poetry more intensively, and in 1987 [[Alan Ross]] accepted "Florida" for the ''[[London Magazine]]''. Thompson has subsequently published more than 20 poems in British, US, and Caribbean journals, including ''[[The Caribbean Writer]]'' and ''[[Mississippi Review]]''. His work is represented in ''The Heinemann Book of Caribbean Poetry'' (1992), ''A World of Poetry for CXC'' (1994), several ''Observer Arts Magazine'' anthologies, ''The Oxford Book of Caribbean Verse'' (2005), and ''Writers Who Paint / Painters Who Write'' (2007).

He has published two collections of poetry and a [[verse novel]]:
*''The Denting of a Wave'' (Leeds: Peepal Tree Press, 1992), {{ISBN|0-948833-62-9}}
*''Moving On'' (Leeds: Peepal Tree Press, 1997), {{ISBN|978-1-900715-17-1}}
*''View from Mount Diablo'' (Leeds: Peepal Tree Press, 2003; 2nd, annotated edition, Leeds: Peepal Tree Press, &amp; Tirril: Humanities-Ebooks, 2009), {{ISBN|1-900715-81-3}} (2003), {{ISBN|978-1-84523-144-6}} (2009 paperback), {{ISBN|978-1-84760-093-6}} (2009 digital).

These volumes were all positively reviewed both in local Jamaican publications&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Mary Hanna, [http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20060903/arts/arts3.html "The Poems of Ralph Thompson"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926070236/http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20060903/arts/arts3.html |date=26 September 2009 }}, in ''[[Jamaica Gleaner|The Sunday Gleaner]]'', 3 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[The Caribbean Review of Books]]'' and ''The Caribbean Writer''.&lt;ref&gt;Reviewers included Louis Simpson (in ''Caribbean Review of Books'', No. 7, February 1993, pp. 10–11) and [[Mervyn Morris]] (in ''Poetry News'' 12, Winter 2005–06, p. 5); [http://www.peepaltreepress.com/review_list.asp?au_id=76 17 reviews] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024033417/http://www.peepaltreepress.com/review_list.asp?au_id=76 |date=24 October 2007 }} are posted or linked at the Peepal Tree Press website.&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson was encouraged to write ''[[View from Mount Diablo]]'' by [[Derek Walcott]], a personal friend,&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Thompson, "In My Own Words" (February 2009), at [http://geoffreyphilp.blogspot.com/2009/02/in-my-own-words-ralph-c-thompson.html Geoffrey Philp's Blog Spot]&lt;/ref&gt; and it won the Jamaican National Literary Prize in manuscript in 2001. It was also warmly praised by the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning Jamaican-American poet [[Louis Simpson]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;
''View from Mount Diablo'' is a remarkable achievement. Its knowledge of the island, the entwining of private lives and politics, lifts Jamaican poetry to a level that has not been attempted before. The poetry is strong, imaginative, fascinating in detail. It describes terrible things with understatement, yet with compassion. I don't think anything could be more harrowing than the rape of Chantal, or the boy begging Alexander to spare his life.... This is narrative poetry at its best.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted on the back cover of the 2003 Peepal Tree Press edition of ''View from Mount Diablo''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The verse novel was serialised in ''The Jamaica Observer'', and the first edition sold more than 300 copies in Jamaica (where the average sale of any new paperback is about 70 copies).&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Thompson, ''View from Mount Diablo: An Annotated Edition'', ed. [[John Lennard]] (Tirril: Humanities-Ebooks, 2009), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

A CD of Thompson reading 28 of his poems, ''Taking Words for a Walk'', was released by the Intermedia Foundation, NY, in 2006. In the liner notes the distinguished Jamaican poet [[Edward Baugh]], who is Professor Emeritus of Caribbean Literature at the [[University of the West Indies, Mona]], says:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Rippling through these poems, nuancing their meaning, is an alertness to class and color distinctions, which grounds the poems in Jamaican social reality and no doubt in the poet's own place in that reality. In "Carpenters", for instance, it matters that peasant Malcolm is "purple black," while the boy is "nearly white." In the sharply, wittily satirical "Pride and Prejudice", the central factor of color consciousness and discrimination operates across cultural boundaries. On a more ominous note are the poems which evoke the sense of social malaise and schism in contemporary Jamaica, a malaise that seems to threaten violent upheaval, poems such as "Vigil", "Death of a Honda Rider", "Jamaican Gothic", "The Garden", and "This New Light".&lt;ref&gt;Edward Baugh, liner notes, p. 3, in Ralph Thompson, ''Taking Words for a Walk'', New York: Intermedia Foundation, 2006; CD IF702.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In October 2015 Thompson received the Silver [[Musgrave Medal]] for his contribution to literature.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/entertainment/20151030/gold-sly-and-robbie Gold for Sly and Robbie]", ''Jamaica Gleaner'', 30 October 2015. Retrieved 1 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''Rudy Fernando Ulloa Igor''' (born 1 April 1960 in [[Puerto Natales]] [[Chile]]) is an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] politician, figurehead, and media entrepreneur who was born in Chile of Chilean parents.

==Early life and education==
Ulloa was born 1 April 1960 in Puerto Natales, Chile, “a small village of fishermen with metal housing painted in primary colors.” When he was a boy, he moved with his mother, Omnia Igor; his brother, Paloma; and his stepfather, José Heriberto Sánchez, to El Carmen, a neighborhood of tin-roofed houses in [[Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz|Río Gallegos]], [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Santa Cruz, Argentina]]. He attended the AGE School, funded by Sofía Vicic de Cepernic.

==Career==
When he was a young man helped to establish “Los Muchachos Peronistas,” a youth group that spawned many corrupt Argentinians which still exists today. At one rally he turned out "more than 1,000 people" in the "Patagonian cold" . Kirchner became Mayor of Rio Gallegos in 1987 and Governor of Santa Cruz in 1991, and appointed Ulloa to the Technical Secretariat. 

Ulloa began publishing a newspaper called ''El Periódico''. During Kirchner’s third term as governor, Ulloa was in charge of TV channel, Channel 5 Community and Channel 2 Rio Gallegos. 
Ulloa later became president of a multimedia business that included a daily newspaper, an FM radio station, a production company, and a local TV channel.&lt;ref name=lanac&gt;{{cite web| title =Habló Rudy Ulloa, el ex chofer de Néstor Kirchner: "No me perdonan el éxito"| work =La Nacion| date =May 19, 2013| url = http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1583496-hablo-rudy-ulloa-el-ex-chofer-de-nestor-kirchner-no-me-perdonan-el-exito}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In May 2013, journalist [[Jorge Lanata]] showed that Ulloa owned a mansion in Rio Gallegos, a fleet of nine high-end cars, and other expensive property.&lt;ref name=lanac/&gt; In April 2014, Ulloa bought a $2 million farm that included a heated pool, soccer field, and a small theater. According to Clarin, at this point he already owned four houses in Rio Gallegos. In 2009, he had purchased a $700,000 mansion in Lomas de San Isidro, a $150,000 field in San Pedro, and an expensive property in the gated Pilar del Este district. The ''Clarin'' report stated that at least one source of his wealth was the income from the government’s advertising in his media properties, from which he had earned over $22 million during the “Kirchner decade.” Clarin reported that even after it folded, “El Periódico continued to receive government advertising.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Salinas| first =Lucia| title =Rudy Ulloa sumó a su fortuna una chacra de US$ 2 millones| work =Clarin| url = http://www.clarin.com/politica/Rudy-Ulloa-fortuna-US-millones_0_1123087762.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in 2013 that Ulloa had collected bribes for Nestor Kirchner from the firm San Isidro, owned by Raul "Cacho" Espinosa, who in return for his "donations" was promised fishing permits by Ulloa.&lt;ref name=sepr&gt;{{cite web| title =LAS VIEJAS CARPETAS: QUIEN ES RUDY ULLOA EL CHOFER DE NESTOR QUE QUISO COMPRAR TELEFE| work =Seprin| date =May 13, 2013| url = http://seprin.info/2013/05/13/las-viejas-carpetas-quien-es-rudy-ulloa-el-chofer-de-nestor-que-quiso-comprar-telefe/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sea Trader: Rise of Taipan''''' is a simulation [[video game]] developed and published by [[Jaleco Entertainment]]'s American division. The game was released exclusively in North America on November 13, 2002 for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. In ''Sea Trader'', the player controls a ship and tries to build a trading empire by selling goods between different ports. Reception was mixed, with praise directed towards the game's addictive nature while criticism focused on its dated graphics and its somewhat bare-bones gameplay.

==Gameplay==
''Sea Trader: Rise of Taipan'' is a shipping simulation game, where the player's goal is to make as much money as possible.&lt;ref name="GS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sea Trader: Rise of Taipan Review |author=Provo, Frank |date=January 29, 2003 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sea-trader-rise-of-taipan-review/1900-2909814/ |accessdate=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sea Trader: Rise of Taipan |author=Harris, Craig |date=January 23, 2003 |publisher=[[IGN]] |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/01/23/sea-trader-rise-of-taipan |accessdate=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player makes profit by buying goods in one port and then selling them in another.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; Players can also use money to bribe [[Customs officer|customs officials]] into allowing them to offload illicit goods that are worth more money.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; The game takes place over a one, five, or ten year period depending on the player's choice at the beginning of the game.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; Money is used to upgrade the player's ship, bribe bartenders into getting gossip and tips, as well as buying maps to access more ports among other things.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; Random encounters with pirates and other events happen during transit between ports—the action is always confined to menus, and contains little gameplay outside the economics simulation of the game.&lt;ref name="GS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt;

==Reception==
The game received mixed reviews from critics, who felt that the game managed to be addictive despite its lackluster gameplay and graphics. It has received a 68% from review aggregator [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="mc"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sea Trader: Rise of Taipan for Game Boy Advance reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/game-boy-advance/sea-trader-rise-of-taipan |accessdate=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]]'s Craig Harris praised the game's replayability and addictive nature, but criticized its lack of "pizazz".&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; [[GameSpot]]'s Frank Provo called the game a "welcome change" and noted that it was a "relatively unique" experience for handheld systems like the Game Boy Advance.&lt;ref name="GS" /&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' criticized the game for having "no action to speak of".&lt;ref name="GamePro"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sea Trader: Rise of Taipan |publisher=[[GamePro]] |url=http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo%2Fgameboy_advance%2Fgames%2Freviews%2F27721.shtml |archive-date=September 5, 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030905180341/www.gamepro.com/nintendo%2Fgameboy_advance%2Fgames%2Freviews%2F27721.shtml |deadurl=yes |accessdate=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Shin was born in [[Ulsan]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese Korea]] in 1922. In 1941, he stowed away on a ship to Japan, where he studied chemical engineering at [[Waseda University]]. He adopted the Japanese name Takeo Shigemitsu and opened a [[rice cooker]] manufacturing plant in 1942.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After the plant was destroyed during an [[Air raids on Japan|air raid]], Shin founded [[Lotte (conglomerate)|Lotte]] in 1948, which grew from selling chewing gum to becoming a major [[multinational corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/03/03/national/media-national/anniversaries-loom-gum-producer-lotte-yoshiwara-red-light-district/|title=Anniversaries loom for gum producer Lotte and the Yoshiwara red-light district|last=Schreiber|first=Mark|date=2018-03-03|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, Shin and his family were ranked 136th on ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine's list, "[[The World's Billionaires]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/business/lists/2006/10/K7A2.html|title=#136 Shin Kyuk-Ho &amp; family|last=|first=|date=2006|website=Forbes|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Shin was ranked 38th on the magazine's list of South Korea's richest people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/83/korea-rich-09_Shin-Kyuk-Ho_K7A2.html|title=#38 Shin Kyuk-Ho|last=|first=|date=2009-04-29|website=Forbes|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lotte itself was [[South Korea]]'s fifth largest [[Chaebol|conglomerate]] as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/business/2017/08/01/27/0501000000AEN20170801007900320F.html|title=Lotte Hotel to open chain in Myanmar next month|last=|first=|date=2017-08-01|work=Yonhap News Agency|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Shin retired from his role as board director of Lotte Holdings Co. after holding the position for nearly 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-24/lotte-group-founder-shin-kyuk-ho-retires-as-board-director-at-94|title=Lotte Group Founder Shin Kyuk-ho Retires as Board Director at 94|last=Kim|first=Hooyeon|date=2017-06-24|website=Bloomberg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-15|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, he was sentenced to four years in prison after he was convicted of embezzling 128.6 billion [[South Korean won|won]] (119 million [[United States dollar|USD]]) from Lotte. However, Shin was allowed to remain free given his poor health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42451425|title=Jail for 95-year-old South Korean tycoon|last=|first=|date=2017-12-22|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

'''Stanko "Cane" Subotić''' (born 9 September 1959, [[Kalinovac (Ub)|Kalinovac]], [[People's Republic of Serbia|PR Serbia]], [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|FPR Yugoslavia]]) is a [[Geneva]]-based Serbian businessman. He was sentenced to six years imprisonment for abuse of office,{{clarify|date=January 2016}} but the case is on appeal. 

Subotić is the founder and owner of the [[Denmark]]-based company EMI (Emerging Marketing Investment) and [[D Trade]] (based in Belgrade, Serbia), dealing in sales and distribution of wine, paper and real estate. Additionally, he is the co-owner of Serbia-based [[Futura Plus]], a commercial distribution network in Southeastern Europe. In Serbia, his companies employ over 4,000 people.{{citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Additionally, Subotić is the co-owner of the meat processing factory Famis LLC (founded in 2002 in Serbia), as well as distribution companies in [[Greece]] and [[Russia]] dealing in non-alcoholic beverages and sporting equipment. Moreover, he bought hundreds of acres of vineyards in [[France]], which he uses for production of the wine Louis Max, which has been served at the [[White House]].&lt;ref name=insajder&gt;[http://www.b92.net/info/emisije/insajder.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=05&amp;nav_id=197780] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522054819/http://www.b92.net/info/emisije/insajder.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=05&amp;nav_id=197780 |date=22 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began investing in this company in 1989, and since January 2007 he is the sole owner of Max Holding.

Subotić owns a wine cellar in downtown [[Belgrade]] and the luxury hotel Villa Montenegro on [[Sveti Stefan]] island. In March 2007, this hotel was awarded the "Five Stars Diamond" award for the quality of service by the [[American Academy of Hospitality Sciences]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Early life and business career==
Subotić came from a working-class family, to which he was born as the sixth and youngest child. During early childhood, he started working in his father's carpentry shop. A Serbian national by birth, since 1999 He completed the streamlined High School of Economics in [[Ub, Serbia|Ub]], where he met his future wife Jagoda. He started earning an independent living in his early twenties when he left for [[France]] and got a job as a tailor. He opened a chain of clothing boutiques, and developed his own wholesale and retail.{{citation needed|date=August 2007}}

During mid-1980s he invested into Serbian economy, by supplying civil engineering equipment which he judged to be in short supply. Subotić started his private business career in 1991 following the collapse of communism in [[SFR Yugoslavia]] by founding a company named MIA and opening a sewing shop that cooperated with state owned [[retailer]] [[Robna kuća Beograd|Robne kuće Beograd]]. From that time until the year 1993, his primary business activities were textile production and confection.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

By 1995, he entered the cigarette trade in [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], a country under a [[United Nations|UN]] imposed [[trade embargo]]. Subotić owned two duty-free shops at the Đeneral Janković border crossing and in 1996 became exclusive distributor of foreign cigarette producers such as [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]] and [[British American Tobacco]]. His cigarette trading business was initially based in Serbia, but, in 1997, after Vlada "Tref" Kovačević  and Radovan "Badža" Stojičić were murdered, Subotić relocated his entire business to [[Montenegro]] and moved there, where he established high political and business connections with the republic's Prime Minister [[Milo Đukanović]] and ruling [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|DPS]] party president [[Svetozar Marović]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.co.rs/temadana.php?id=5486|title=Mira i Marko predvodili jednu od mafijaških grupa|website=Blic.co.rs|date=9 June 2007|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Subotić opened a subsidiary in Montenegro, which is in operation to this day. The same year, he acquired the Serbian company [[Duvan]], owner of a large distribution network which included retail booths and kiosks selling printed media and other consumer goods, and founded the company [[Futura plus]]. After acquiring Duvan, in 2004, he began collaborating with the German media holding group [[WAZ-Mediengruppe|WAZ]], which brought him new points of sale as it acquired a majority stake at [[Politika AD|Politika distribution]]. Futura Plus now owns the largest media distribution network in Serbia with a large number of kiosks and newspaper stands, previously owned by Duvan, Politika distribution, [[Borba (newspaper)|Borba distribution]] and [[Duvanpromet]] from [[Kragujevac]]. After Serbian Prosecution raised accusations against Subotic in 2008, WAZ Media Group left Futura plus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/srbija.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=08&amp;nav_id=297516|title=VAC prodao udeo u "Futuri plus"|website=B92.net|date=8 May 2008|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Montenegro he founded a company named Montenegro Futura that owns a similar distribution network throughout the country.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

In 2005, Subotić moved his business headquarters to [[Cyprus]]. During the Spring 2007, Subotić additionally expanded his activities with two large investments in Montenegro: purchasing a piece of the island of St Nikola near the port of [[Budva]] from a Serbian businessman, Nenad Đorđević, for approximately [[€]]24 million and announcing his plans to build a luxury hotel worth [[€]]20 million on the St. Stefan island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/vesti/story.php?vest=52391] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010608/http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/vesti/story.php?vest=52391 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Subotić faced numerous allegations and accusations of smuggling, tax evasion, and state budget defrauding stemming from 1990s cigarette trade in the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] that was under a UN trade embargo at the time.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

===The ''Nacional'' affair===
In May 2001, Croatia's ''[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]]'' newsmagazine, owned and edited by [[Ivo Pukanić]], published detailed accounts of Subotić's activities, claiming they involved organized crime figures as well as the highest echelons of the Montenegrin and Serbian political regimes. Largely unknown and unexposed up to that point, the entire ''Nacional'' affair forced Subotić into the public limelight as he began giving occasional interviews in the Serbian media. He responded that the news stories were fabrications paid for and planted by a competing Croatian tobacco producer, [[Tvornica duhana Rovinj]], supposedly threatened by Subotić's plans to jointly build a tobacco factory in Serbia with British American Tobacco in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2003/01/10/pisma/srpski/pisma.shtml|title=Stanko Subotić Cane: Moj deo istine|website=Arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the coming years, Subotić filed a series of lawsuits against ''Nacional'' and its owner/editor-in-chief Pukanić in [[Zagreb]] on the grounds of slander. In Croatia, Subotić was represented by a Croatian lawyer, Slobodan Budak. ''Nacional'' claimed that "Subotić lost each one of the 26 lawsuits he filed against the magazine", while Subotić's lawyer in Serbia, Vlado Pavićević, claimed his client has "at least nine court verdicts in his favour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Hronika/t31491.sr.html|title=Политика Online|website=Politika.rs|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 ''Insajder'' interview===
In mid 2006, Subotić was hit with a new series of accusations when findings of the 2003 Serbian police investigation (soubriquetted "Mreža") were obtained by several media outlets, including [[B92]]. In it, Subotić's involvement in cigarette trade between 1995 and 1999 is characterized as "smuggling without taxation made possible by high ranking members of [[Slobodan Milošević|Milošević]]'s regime".&lt;ref name=insajder/&gt;

On 15 May 2006, Subotić's taped interview with journalist [[Brankica Stanković]] aired on B92's ''[[Insajder]]'' programme. In it he claimed to have been shown the results of "Mreža" investigation way back in 2003 by then Serbian Interior Minister [[Dušan Mihajlović (politician)|Dušan Mihajlović]]. Subotić added that Mihajlović reassured him on the same occasion that he (Subotić) is not in any way subject of investigation, telling him that "your (Subotić's) business activities during the 1990s were found to be legit".{{cn|date=January 2016}}

===2007 'Mreža' arrests and Interpol arrest warrant===
On 6 June 2007 Serbian police arrested eight individuals, which it believes were part of a 15-person criminal group organized by Subotić. Subotić himself was not placed under arrest that day, because the police could not find him, however, an [[Interpol]] arrest warrant was later issued for him. The arrested individuals were placed in a 48-hour detention, and they include:
*Milan Popivoda, former chief of Novi Sad state security branch
*Miodrag Zavišić, former chief of Novi Sad police department
*Nebojša "Tarzan" Nikolić and Drage Dodeski, former federal customs bureau employees
*Milan "Mrgud" Milanović, former employee of different federal bodies and a prominent member of Škorpioni paramilitary unit. Since 2002 co-owner of Famis d.o.o. meat factory with Subotić&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Hronika/t30687.sr.html|title=Политика Online|website=Politika.rs|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Milan "Pekin" Ranković, an employee in Subotić's MIA company
*Ivana Olujić, accused of acting as a proxy in cigarette smuggling
*Miroslav "Miki" Pešić, accused of making payments on behalf of Subotić's MIA company.

On the same day, the [[Serbian Ministry of the Interior]] (MUP) issued a press release saying: "These arrests occurred following a detailed and thorough investigation taking place over several years in collaboration with special persecutor's office in regard to  "Mreža" investigation. Subotić's group is being accused of illegally importing cigarettes and selling them on the [[black market]]. By doing so they defrauded the state budget of [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]80 million in unpaid tax. The money they made in Serbia was transferred to their accounts in [[Cyprus]] via [[Montenegro]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/vesti/text.php?vest=59522] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608104436/http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/vesti/text.php?vest=59522 |date=8 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Subotić, six other individuals were sought by police on the same occasion: Ivan Krčmaričić, Đorđe Subotić, Luka Nenadić, Jovica Ranđelović, Stevan Banović, and Nikola Milošević (Subotić's nephew). Subotić eventually responded to the charges through a press release forwarded to Montenegrin state news agency MINA on 26 June 2007. He claimed innocence adding he did business in line with widely used practices at the time, and added, "The goal of this thing that's started by [[Belgrade]] is to smear my reputation in front of my business partners in [[Serbia]] and the rest of [[Europe]], but I'm not the main target. This will turn into one more attack on [[Montenegro]] by those that are pathologically obsessed with its independence, like they were with [[Zoran Đinđić|Đinđić]] all until his death." Subotić accused Montenegrin opposition leader [[Nebojša Medojević]] of insinuations and of "writing newspaper columns that helped create the atmosphere for the murder of Zoran Đinđić". Subotić concluded by saying: "Medojević and [[Vojislav Koštunica]] are working on the satanization of the Montenegrin state by creating an impression of its supposed criminalization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=06&amp;dd=26&amp;nav_id=252762|title=Subotić: Nisam švercovao cigarete|website=B92.net|date=26 June 2007|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 arrest and two-month detention in Moscow===
On 28 April 2008, Subotić was arrested in [[Moscow]] at [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]] based on an [[Interpol]] red notice warrant issued against him by the Serbian police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/hronika.php?id=39776|title=Cane uhapšen u Moskvi|website=Blic.rs|date=29 April 2008|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though initially it looked like he'd be  transferred to native [[Serbia]] where he's indicted on smuggling and tax fraud charges, and despite the fact that Serbian authorities sent an official extradition request for him to Russia, the Russian authorities let him go free on 27 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/world/text.php?vest=101454] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709015514/http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/world/text.php?vest=101454 |date=9 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===B92 Interview, 16 March 2010===
Subotić accused [[Nebojša Medojević]], the [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] party leader of [[Movement for Change]] of having organized a manhunt on him on the orders of [[Serbia]]n businessman [[Milan Beko]] and Delta Holding owner Miroslav Mišković after they stole 50 million from Subotić to buy [[Port of Belgrade]] and daily newspaper [[Večernje Novosti]]. Medojević had claimed that Subotić and Darko Šarić had been hiding in a Montenegrin police villa in [[Žabljak]], while Subotić claimed in an interview that he was in [[Geneva, Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2010&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=16&amp;nav_id=65829] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221052039/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2010&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=16&amp;nav_id=65829 |date=21 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels''''' is a 2014 book by [[United States|American]] energy theorist [[Alex Epstein (American writer)|Alex Epstein]],&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite web|last1=Broughton|first1=Philip Delves|title=Making ‘The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels’|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-the-moral-case-for-fossil-fuels-by-alex-epstein-1417477909|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the author argues that, although sometimes labeled as "immoral," the use of [[fossil fuel]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s dramatically improves the overall progress of humanity, and improves life expectancy and income.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; The book was a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' and ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' bestseller.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Selling Science Books|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/16/science/best-selling-science-books.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bicmagazine.com/industry-segments/drilling-exploration-subsection/author-epstein-makes-the-moral-case-for-fossil-fuels/ |title=Author Epstein makes the moral case for fossil fuels |author=White, Andrew |website=BICMagazine.com |accessdate=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels'' outlines the benefits that the development of coal, oil, and natural gas have had on mankind, including improved health, increased lifespan, and expansion of material welfare.&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite web|title=Making the Case for the Benefits of Fossil Fuels|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2014-11-17/making-the-case-for-the-benefits-of-fossil-fuels|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stossel|first1=John|title=Fossil fuels are no catastrophe.

The book also covers the topics of climate livability, the effects of [[carbon emissions]], the nature of the environmental movement, and the role fossil fuels play in everyday life.&lt;ref name=cspan&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edward Hilboldt|first1=John|title=Book Discussion on The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?322718-1/book-discussion-moral-case-fossil-fuels|publisher=CSPAN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=financialpost&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foster|first1=Peter|title=Peter Foster: Don’t trust the global warming doomsters and their moral outrage|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2015/01/29/peter-foster-why-you-cant-trust-the-global-warming-doomsters/|work=Financial Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein writes that alternative energy sources like wind, solar, and [[biofuel]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are inferior to fossil fuels because they are more expensive and less reliable.&lt;ref name=blaze&gt;Veer, PeerGuy [http://www.theblaze.com/contributions/the-moral-case-for-fossil-fuels-a-bold-humanist-statement/ The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels: A Bold Humanist Statement] ''The Blaze''.

In 2014, Epstein was interviewed by [[Peter Thiel]] at an event hosted by the energy startup Tachyus. Thiel also provided a blurb for the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://industrialprogress.com/2014/11/25/the-moral-case-rising/ The Moral Case Rising] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209211642/http://industrialprogress.com/2014/11/25/the-moral-case-rising/ |date=2015-02-09 }} “Center for Industrial Progress”.

In December 2014, political commentator [[John McLaughlin (host)|John McLaughlin]] called Epstein "most original thinker of the year" for his book during McLaughlin's yearly ''[[The McLaughlin Group]]'' roundup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The McLaughlin Group 12/26/14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW-gLEpyjGY&amp;feature=youtu.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jensen (ed.). pp. 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Arena, Wisconsin]], Burns obtained his BA degree from [[University of Wisconsin]], while working at the Gisholt Machine Company. From early 1943 to late 1945 he served in the United States Army in Europe during World War II. Returning to University of Wisconsin, he obtained his BBA in accounting and American history in 1950. Subsequently, he obtained his CPA license for the State of Wisconsin in 1952, his MBA from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1957, and his PhD in accounting from the [[University of Minnesota]] under Carl L. Nelson.&lt;ref name="DD 1996"&gt;Dan Jensen. "[http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/cdm/ref/collection/aah/id/29520 THOMAS J.

After his graduation in 1948, Burns worked at the Wisconsin Department of Taxation briefly, and then became controller for [[Lawrence University]] in Appleton, Wisconsin and later also lecturer. For some time in the late 1950s he also taught accounting at [[Southern Illinois University]]. Eventually in 1963 he moved to [[Ohio State University]], where he became Professor of Accounting in 1967 and chair of the department from 1977 to 1981.&lt;ref name="AH0F 2015"/&gt; One of his first accomplishments was the initiation of a PhD program in modern accounting. Around 1965 he also initiated the Ohio State Accounting Honors Program.&lt;ref name="AB 1995"/&gt; Burns was also a Visiting Professor at the University of Chicago, Harvard University, Stanford University, and the University of California at Berkeley.&lt;ref name="AB 1995"/&gt;

At the [[American Accounting Association]] (AAA) he served as director of education. He later was awarded the AAA Outstanding Accounting Educator Award, as well as the AICPA Outstanding Accounting Educator Award.&lt;ref name="AB 1995"/&gt; He was inducted into the [[Accounting Hall of Fame]] in 1997.

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Trademark infringement''' is a violation of the [[exclusive right]]s attached to a [[trademark]] without the authorization of the trademark owner or any licensees (provided that such authorization was within the scope of the licence). Infringement may occur when one party, the "infringer", uses a trademark which is identical or [[confusing similarity|confusingly similar]] to a trademark owned by another party, in relation to products or services which are identical or similar to the products or services which the registration covers. An owner of a trademark may commence civil [[lawsuit|legal proceedings]] against a party which infringes its registered trademark. In the United States, the [[Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984]] criminalized the intentional trade in counterfeit goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Irina D. Manta Spring 2011 [http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v24/24HarvJLTech469.pdf The Puzzle of Criminal Sanctions for Intellectual Property Infringement] Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology 24(2):469-518&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|485–486}}

If the respective marks and products or services are entirely dissimilar, trademark infringement may still be established if the registered mark is well known pursuant to the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention]]. In the United States, a cause of action for use of a mark for such dissimilar services is called [[trademark dilution]].

In some jurisdictions a party other than the owner (e.g., a licensee) may be able to pursue trademark infringement proceedings against an infringer if the owner fails to do so.

Courts consider various factors in order to determine whether a trademark was infringed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-10-30|title=Rescuecom Corp. v. Google Inc.|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rescuecom_Corp._v._Google_Inc.&amp;oldid=807804980|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/13859|title=Rescuecom Corp. v. Google Inc.|website=h2o.law.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Whether the plaintiff has a valid trademark. A trademark can be valid because it is officially registered, or because it has a claim under common law.
* Whether the trademark is being used by the defendant. 
* Whether the defendant's use of the mark is "in commerce."
* Whether that use is connected to the sale, offer, distribution, or advertising of a product. 
* Whether the defendant's use of the trademark is likely to confuse consumers. 
This last factor, consumer confusion, is the main topic of debate in most cases. 

=== Consumer Confusion ===
Where the respective marks or products or services are not identical, similarity will generally be assessed by reference to whether there is a '''likelihood of confusion''' that consumers will believe the products or services originated from the trademark owner.

Likelihood of confusion is not necessarily measured by actual [[consumer confusion]] if two products do not directly compete against each other but are in proximate markets. Then, to determine consumer confusion, a court may apply one of various factor tests. The primary test comes from [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] and is found in ''AMF, Inc v. Sleekcraft Boats'', 599 F.2d 341 (C.A.9) 1979.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Court there announced eight specific elements to measure likelihood of confusion:
# Strength of the mark
# Proximity of the goods
# Similarity of the marks
# Evidence of actual confusion
# Marketing channels used
# Type of goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser
# Defendant's intent in selecting the mark
# Likelihood of expansion of the product lines&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tmcases/amf.htm AMF, Inc v Sleekcraft Boats, 599 F.2d 341 (C.A.9) 1979]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www3.ce9.uscourts.gov/jury-instructions/node/244|title=15.18 Infringement—Likelihood of Confusion—Factors—Sleekcraft Test {{!}} Model Jury Instructions|website=www3.ce9.uscourts.gov|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyber.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tm.htm|title=Overview of Trademark Law|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyber.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tmcases/polaroid.htm|title=Polaroid Corp. v.

Other Courts have fashioned their own tests for likelihood of confusion—like those announced in ''In re E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co''., 476 F.2d 1357, 177 USPQ 563 (CCPA 1973)'',''&lt;ref&gt;[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-11th-circuit/1413742.html IN RE E.I. DuPONT DE NEMOURS &amp; COMPANY-BENLATE LITIGATION], 476 F.2d 1357 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; known collectively as the [[United States trademark law|''DuPont'' factors]].

== Defenses ==
The party accused of infringement may be able to defeat infringement proceedings if it can establish a valid ''exception'' (e.g., comparative advertising) or ''defence'' (e.g., [[Laches (equity)|laches]]) to infringement, or attack and cancel the underlying registration (e.g., for non-use) upon which the proceedings are based. Other defenses include [[Genericide|genericness]], functionality, [[Abandonment of trademark|abandonment]], or [[Fair use (U.S. trademark law)|fair use]]. 

== Globally ==
The [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement|ACTA trade agreement]], signed in May 2011 by the United States, Japan, Switzerland, and the EU, requires that its parties add criminal penalties, including incarceration and fines, for copyright and trademark infringement, and obligated the parties to actively police for infringement.&lt;ref name="Bitton"&gt;Miriam Bitton (2012) [http://www.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/backissues/v102/n1/1021_67.Bitton.pdf Rethinking the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement’s Criminal Copyright Enforcement Measures] The Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology 102(1):67-117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ige.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/Juristische_Infos/e/transparency_paper.pdf|title=The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement – Summary of Key Elements Under Discussion|date=November 6, 2009|work=transparency paper|publisher=Swiss federation of Intellectual Property|format=pdf|accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Xuan_p211"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bN3o1uwpKF4C&amp;dq=copyright+infringement+international+acta&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Intellectual property enforcement: international perspectives|last=Correa|first=Carlos Maria|author2=Li, Xuan|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-1-84844-663-2|pages=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries (but not in countries like the United States, which recognizes common law trademark rights), a trademark which is ''not'' registered cannot be "infringed" as such, and the trademark owner cannot bring infringement proceedings. Instead, the owner may be able to commence proceedings under the common law for [[passing off]] or [[misrepresentation]], or under legislation which prohibits [[unfair business practices]]. In some jurisdictions, infringement of [[trade dress]] may also be actionable.

== Notable cases ==
* ''[[Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc.]]'', case still pending
* ''[[Google, Inc. v. American Blind &amp; Wallpaper Factory, Inc.]]'', in which Google's AdWords program was alleged to be in violation of trademark
* ''[[Rescuecom Corp. v. Google Inc.]]'', in which the use of trademarks in Google's AdWords program was found to be a "use in commerce" under the Lanham Act
* ''[[Network Automation, Inc. v. Advanced Systems Concepts, Inc.]]'', in which the use of a competitor's trademark as an Internet advertisement search keyword was found to not constitute trademark infringement
* ''[[College Network, Inc. v. Moore Educational Publishers, Inc.]]'', in which the use of a competitor's trademark does not qualify as a "use in commerce" is upheld
* ''[[Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elects.]]''

'''Vornado''' is a US firm based in [[Andover, Kansas]], that designs and manufactures household fans and other small appliances related to air circulation.&lt;ref name="expansion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/print-edition/2011/12/02/vornado-expanding-headquarters-with.html |title=Vornado expanding headquarters with $1M warehouse addition |publisher=Wichita Business Journal |date=2 December 2011 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current incarnation of the company was founded in 1989, two years after the death of Ralph K. Odor (1895-1987), who founded the firm in the 1930s with Ottis A. Sutton in [[Wichita, Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/vornado-realty-trust-history/&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the name of the company is a [[portmanteau]] of "Vortex" and "Tornado".

==History==
[[File:Vornado.jpg|thumb|A vintage model from the 1940s or 1950s]]
Ralph K. Odor experimented with different designs to improve [[propeller (aircraft)|airplane propeller]]s in the late 1920s. In the 1930s, Odor met Ottis A. Sutton and the two men continued to experiment with different designs for propellers and were granted several patents. Odor and Sutton realized the propeller designs could also be applied to household fans, and after the end of [[World War II]], the '''O.A. Sutton Corporation''' began marketing Vornado fans under the ''Vornadofan'' brandname.&lt;ref name="about_us_vornado_com"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|url=http://www.vornado.com/about-vornado/AboutUs.aspx|title=About Us|publisher=Vornado Air LLC|accessdate=December 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="company_history"&gt;[https://www.vornado.com/history "Our history of making history,"] official website, Vornado Air, LLC, retrieved June 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Early fans were designed by industrial designer Richard Ten Eyck.&lt;ref name="teneyck"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|url=http://www.artic.edu/research/richard-ten-eyck-1920-2009|title=Richard Ten Eyck|publisher=[[Art Institute of Chicago]]|accessdate=December 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and were distinguished from ordinary fans by enclosure in a short duct shaped as [[aerodynamics|aerodynamically]] contoured cylindrical ring, with an added concentric flared intake duct ring, sharply pitched blades, stationary [[vanes]] and aerodynamic [[grille]], and rubber [[shock-mount]]ing;  the design was advertised as making the fan exceptionally quiet, efficient and effective, delivering a narrower, more-concentrated blast of air than normal fans.&lt;ref name="company_history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="company_faqs"&gt;[https://www.vornado.com/faqs "FAQs,"] official website, Vornado Air, LLC, retrieved June 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company later added a line of air conditioners.

Amid sales that had fallen to half of its peak, the company ceased production in September 1958 and began liquidating its inventory, and manufacturing and office equipment were auctioned off in June 1959.&lt;ref name="tihen"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|url=http://specialcollections.wichita.edu/collections/local_history/tihen/pdf/eagle/Eag1959.pdf|title=Tihen Notes from 1959 Wichita Eagle|publisher=Department of Special Collections, Wichita State University Libraries|accessdate=December 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutton's air conditioner coil manufacturing line was purchased by '''Gibson Refrigerator Co.''' and moved from Wichita.&lt;ref name="gibson"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|date=August 1959|url=http://specialcollections.wichita.edu/collections/local_history/tihen/pdf/eagle/Eag1959.pdf|title=Briefly Stated|publisher=''Air Conditioning, Heating and Ventilating''|accessdate=December 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1959, the O.A. Sutton Corp. was purchased by the discount department store chain '''[[Two Guys]],''' which subsequently renamed itself '''Vornado, Inc.'''&lt;ref name=Vornado_history&gt;{{cite web |title=Vornado Realty Trust |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Vornado-Realty-Trust-Company-History.html |accessdate=August 31, 2014 |work=FundingUniverse |date=&lt;!--undated--&gt; |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The consolidated company expanded the Vornado line of appliances to more than 50 in under three years, including ranges, freezers, hair dryers, and [[Can opener|electronic can openers]] sold by the Two Guys chain as well as other dealers, though the manufacturing operations were [[Outsourcing|outsourced]].&lt;ref name=Vornado_history /&gt; That company eventually divested all retail operations and evolved into what is now '''[[Vornado Realty Trust]],''' a [[real estate investment trust]].

==Current==
The Vornado brand name was resurrected in 1989 by Michael Coup. Operating under the name '''Vornado Air Circulation Systems Inc.,''' Coup obtained the rights to the Vornado trademark and worked with original designer Richard Ten Eyck to come up with a new fan design.&lt;ref name="newvornado"&gt;{{cite web|last=Siebenmark|first=Jerry|date=February 23, 2003|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/stories/2003/02/24/story7.html|title=Making 'good stuff' that lasts is what pleases Vornado's Michael Coup|publisher=''Wichita Business Journal''|accessdate=December 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially the company operated in northeast Wichita (Vornado's original hometown).

Between January 1989 and August 1990, Vornado sold about 135,000 of its fans with a distinctive spiral [[grille]]. In August 1990, competitor Duracraft began offering a cheaper, visually similar fan, and by November 1992, Duracraft had sold nearly one million of them -- that company's second-largest-selling household fan. Vornado sued under the [[Lanham Act]] claiming deceptive imitation in appearance -- but an appeals court ruled against Vornado, because the design had been a part of their expired patent, and was now in the [[public domain]].&lt;ref name="appeal_vorndao_v_duracraft"&gt;[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-ca10-94-03191/pdf/USCOURTS-ca10-94-03191-0.pdf "VORNADO AIR CIRCULATION SYSTEMS INC v.

According to the U.S. [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC), from January 1993 through February 2004, Vornado received over 300 reports of defective heater units overheating, melting, smoking, or catching fire. The CPSC alleged that Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc., failed to promptly report these incidents to the CPSC as required by law, saying Vornado only reported the incidents to the CPSC after CPSC staff started asking questions, in February, 2004. &lt;ref name="vornado_trust_to_pay_cpsc"&gt;[https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2008/Vornado-Trust-to-Pay-500000-Civil-Penalty-for-Failure-to-Report-Defects-and-Hazards-with-Electric-Heaters "Vornado Trust to Pay $500,000 Civil Penalty for Failure to Report Defects and Hazards with Electric Heaters,"], Release #08-180, January 31, 2008, U.S. [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], retrieved June 26, 2017 {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, Vornado Air Circulation Systems sold most of its assets to a private equity firm, which formed a new company, '''Vornado Air, LLC.''' , in Wichita's neighboring suburban community of [[Andover, Kansas]].&lt;ref name="llc"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|date=February 5, 2008|url=https://www.cpsc.gov//PageFiles/96713/vornado.pdf|title=Consumer Product Safety Commission|publisher=Federal Register|accessdate=December 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vornado_vh110 recall_cpsc_gov"&gt;[https://www.cpsc.gov/recalls/2014/vornado-air-recalls-electric-space-heaters "Vornado Air Recalls Electric Space Heaters Due to Fire and Burn Hazard,"] Recall #14-256, August 14, 2014, U.S. [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], retrieved June 26, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In January, 2008, the CPSC reported that a  liquidating trust, acting on behalf of the by-now dissolved manufacturer, Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc. (formerly of Andover, Kansas), agreed to pay the government a $500,000 civil penalty, settling the prior CPSC allegations against Vornado Air Circulation Systems Inc., regarding the 300-plus unreported defective heater units. Vornado did not, however, concede any violation of law.&lt;ref name="vornado_trust_to_pay_cpsc" /&gt;

On August 14, 2014, the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission|CPSC]] announced a recall of 79,000 Vornado-brand electric heaters (Vornado VH110 Whole Room Vortex electric space heaters) which had been made in China for Vornado Air, LLC, of [[Andover, Kansas]], and sold for about $60 at several major retail store chains and online sellers. The recall followed 29 reports of units overheating and melting, including seven reports of heaters catching fire, resulting in one report of smoke inhalation and one report of property damage caused by soot and smoke.&lt;ref name="vornado_vh110 recall_cpsc_gov" /&gt;

'''Şarık Tara''' (22 April 1930 – 28 June 2018) was a Turkish billionaire who founded [[Enka İnşaat ve Sanayi A.Ş.]], Turkey's largest construction company, with [[Sadi Gülçelik]], in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/opinion/jale-ozgenturk/turkish-business-mogul-sarik-tara-dies-at-88-133983|title=Turkish business mogul Şarık Tara dies at 88|website=Hürriyet Daily News|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as being an international engineer, contractor, industrialist, he was known for his philanthropy.

==Personal life ==
=== Early life and education===
Tara was born in what is now the [[Republic of Macedonia]] but emigrated with his family to Turkey in 1942 when he was 12 due to [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/sarik-tara/|title=Sarik Tara|website=forbes.com|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father Fevzija Hadžihamzić, an ethnic [[Bosniak]], was from [[Priboj]] in the [[Sandžak]] region of [[Serbia]]. Upon arrival to Turkey, his father changed their surname to Tara, in reference to river [[Tara (Drina)|Tara]] which flows mainly through Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro.

The family's extremely reduced circumstances required Tara to start working when he was young. His knowledge of foreign languages help him secure night work as a translator at a textile factory while he was still attending Şişli Terakki high school.&lt;ref name="YeniAkıt"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.yeniakit.com.tr/kimdir/%C5%9Ear%C4%B1k_Tara  |title=Sarik Tara|website=yeniakit.com|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tara graduated with a degree in Civil Engineering from Istanbul Technical University in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://ins.itu.edu.tr/hakkimizda/mezunlarimiz/sarik-tara |title=Sarik Tara|website= ins.itu.edu.tr |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and Children===
Tara married Lale Ataman in 1956.&lt;ref name="YeniAkıt"/&gt; The couple has three children, seven grandchildren and eight great grandchildren.

Tara's son M. Sinan Tara is currently ENKA's Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. Tara's grandson, A. Mehmet Tara, is currently ENKA's President and Chairman of the Executive Committee.

==Career==

===Business===
Between 1954 and 1957, Tara worked as a site manager on various construction projects. In 1957, with his brother-in-law, [[Sadi Gülçelik]], he established ENKA contracting company.

Today [[Enka İnşaat ve Sanayi A.Ş.]] is a global company in the construction sector with large scale road, tunnel, power plant, and real estate projects. To date, it has completed 396 projects in 45 countries with a total contract value of 40 billion USD. Domestically, it has completed 124 projects in Turkey with a total contract value of 7 billion USD.&lt;ref name="2017 Annual Report"&gt;

 |title=ENKA Annual Report 2017|website= ENKA Insaat ve Sanayi AS |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
ENKA is also known for constructing U.S. embassy buildings; 36% ($887 million) of ENKA's revenue during the first nine months of 2017 came from the construction of U.S. embassy buildings in various countries.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;

The conglomerate is one Turkey's largest electricity producers, and is expanding in the energy sector. Over half of ENKA's approximately $3.5 billion in annual revenue comes from energy production.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; It is Turkey's leading private electricity producer.

From 1984 onwards, Tara played a pioneering role in Turkey entering the Soviet Union. In 1988, Tara signed the contracts for ENKA's renovation of the Petrovski Arcade and construction of the Moscow Hospital. ENKA currently owns offices, a hotel, and 11 shopping malls across Russia. Tara also paved the way for other Turkish companies to become successful in Russia.&lt;ref name="Cigdem" /&gt;

===International Relations===
After Tara's first participation in the World Economic Forum in Davos in 1973, he became a regular. Tara is considered a catalyst in developing Turkey's international relations and presence in the 1970s and 80s.&lt;ref name="Cigdem" /&gt; Tara advocated for increased dialogue and commerce between Greece and Turkey. During the World Economic Forum in Davos in 1988, Tara was instrumental in the meeting between prime ministers Turgut Özal and Andreas Papandreou, resulting in the establishment of an official bilateral dialogue between the two countries &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://altayatli.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Atli_dissertation-copy.pdf

and Tara becoming the chair of the Turkish-Greek Business Council.&lt;ref name="Cigdem" /&gt; Tara remained in this role until 2004. His role in establishing increased cooperation between the respective business communities earned him the first and only Business Statesman Award from the World Economic Forum in 2016.&lt;ref name="WEF" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tara was active in the foundation of Turkey's Foreign Economic Relations Board (DEİK) in 1986, becoming a member of its executive board. The same year, Tara chaired the Turkish-Japanese Business Council, which was established within DEIK in the same year. He remained in this position until 2000.&lt;ref name="Cigdem" /&gt;

Tara lobbied for Turkey's accession to the European Union for many years, as well as for promoting regional peace in the Balkans.&lt;ref name="Cigdem" /&gt;

===Philanthropic Works===
In 1983, Şarık Tara established the 33,600m2 Sadi Gülçelik Sports Complex located in Istinye, Istanbul, named in honor of his deceased brother-in-law and business partner. This facility was designed to support education, the arts, and sports. To guarantee the future of this facility, Tara established the ENKA Foundation the same year.&lt;ref name="ENKA Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.enka.com/sustainability/home/society/enka-foundation/ |title= ENKA Foundation |website=ENKA|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
